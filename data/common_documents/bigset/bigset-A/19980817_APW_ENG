<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian skipper Laurie Piper's
homecoming after five years at sea in his home-built yacht will
have to wait. First he must rescue American adventurer Steve
Fossett, whose balloon came down in the South Pacific.
	   Piper and his crew, including daughter Jana, are expected to be
the first to reach Fossett after diverting from the last leg of
their leisurely circumnavigation of the globe when the emergency
calls went out early Monday.
	   Fossett, a millionaire adventurer from Chicago, went down Sunday
night near the Chesterfield Islands, about 500 miles (800 km) off
Australia's east coast, two-thirds of the way through a planned
around-the-world voyage.
	   When rescue authorities in Australia sent out emergency
bulletins to any ships in a 200-nautical-mile radius of Fossett's
emergency beacon signal, Piper's boat Atlanta was already on the
way, having been alerted by a ham radio operator friend in Port
Vila, Vanuatu.
	   Fossett was bobbing in a lifeboat in the Coral Sea after a
French military plan found him Monday morning.
	   A long-time sailor, Piper said he had taken part in rescue's
before, but never saved a balloonist. He expects Atlanta, the
60-foot (18-meter) wooden schooner he built at his home in Eden,
New South Wales state, to reach Fossett by Monday evening.
	   ``We'll have a dinghy with an outboard ready to launch,'' Piper
told The Associated Press by radio phone.
	   ``We'll pick him up as soon as we get there and bring him on
board, give him a cup of coffee, wrap him up and put a good feed in
him.''
	   A fully medically equipped New Zealand Navy tanker is an
estimated three or four hours behind Atlanta, and authorities
expect that Fossett will be transferred on board and brought to
Townsville, in Australia's Queensland state.
	   Authorities hold safety concerns about the rescue because the
region is dotted with reefs, many of which are uncharted. Piper
said he has sailed the reefs before and knows the area.
	   ``I know it is treacherous around there but I am quite sure
we'll be okay.''
	   ``We were just coming home after five years out ... the
Caribbean, the Mediterranean, all over the place,'' he said.
	   He said conditions Monday afternoon were calm after a night of
storms with lightning and high winds to the north and south of the
Atlanta.
	   Piper said he was about 50 nautical miles from Fossett's
position and was motoring at 7.5 knots. He expected to arrive at
the area about 7 p.m. local time (0900 GMT).

	   In Phoenix, Omar Daal, fast becoming the young ace of the
Arizona pitching staff, limited New York to two hits in eight
innings and Travis Lee broke out of a slump with his 20th home run.
	   Mets' pitchers walked 10 batters and New York committed two
errors, one by second baseman Carlos Baerga with the bases loaded
in the fifth, to drop a half-game behind Chicago in the NL
wild-card chase.
	   Daal (6-7) gave up only Jermaine Allensworth's leadoff home run
and Mike Piazza's one-out double, both in the fourth. The two hits
allowed were a franchise low. The Venezuelan left-hander has given
up six earned runs in his last five starts.

Report: Suspect gave composed confession
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A man detained because he didn't
match the picture in his passport gave Pakistani interrogators a
calm and determined confession to having helped plan the U.S.
Embassy bombings in East Africa, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The Pakistani national newspaper The News, quoting unnamed
government sources, said the man identified as Mohammad Sadik
Howaida also claimed the attack was sponsored by Osama bin Laden, a
Saudi harbored in neighboring Afghanistan who U.S. officials have
identified as a possible suspect in the bombings.
	   The nearly simultaneous bombings on Aug. 7 at the embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania killed 257 people.
	   The United States has said bin Laden is among the world's most
militant sponsors of terrorism. He has been vocal in his hatred of
what he sees as U.S. imperialism and pledged to drive U.S. troops
out of bases in places like his native Saudi Arabia.
	   Sources quoted in The News on Monday said they were surprised by
Howaida's composure under interrogation. They quoted him as saying
that with the bombings, he had shown his determination to meet a
pledge to the Muslim world.
	   In a brief statement Sunday, Pakistani Foreign Ministry
spokesman Tariq Altaf said Howaida arrived at the Karachi airport
from Nairobi on the day of the bombings. Immigration officials
determined Howaida's Yemeni passport was forged, and he was
interrogated by Pakistani officials who determined he had some link
to the African bombings.
	   ``On satisfaction about his involvement in these terrorist acts,
he was sent back to Nairobi and handed over to the Kenyan
authorities for appropriate action under their law,'' Altaf said,
adding that Howaida was sent to Nairobi aboard a special Pakistani
plane. Altaf did not say when Howaida was returned, but another
government source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was
Aug. 14.
	   The News said the suspect was a 34-year-old Palestinian engineer
who confessed to helping plan the bombing. He reportedly told
investigators six other conspirators slipped through the Karachi
airport Aug. 7 and apparently made it to Afghanistan, where they
had been told they would be congratulated by bin Laden.
	   The circumstances surrounding Pakistan's handling of the case
remain unclear. The News reported that one of its sources said
Howaida was handed over to U.S. officials who took him to an
undisclosed location, while another source told the news he was
handed over to Kenyan officials in Nairobi.
	   A government source had told The Associated Press on condition
of anonymity that U.S. investigators who came to Karachi were
denied access to the suspect, and had to follow him on another
plane to Nairobi, where he was handed over to Kenyans.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Altaf stressed without elaborating
that the case was a matter between Pakistan and Kenya.
	   Pakistan's unwillingness to either deal with the Americans or
admit U.S. participation may stem from the case involving Mir Aimal
Kasi, a Pakistani convicted in the United States of killing two CIA
employees during a shooting spree in Virginia in 1993.
	   When Kasi was arrested in Pakistan in June 1997 in a joint
FBI-Pakistani operation, angry Pakistanis accused their government
of groveling before U.S. power.

Myanmar issues veiled threat of violence against foreign activists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's military government issued a
veiled threat of violence Monday against any foreigners intent on
repeating the pro-democracy leafletting campaign carried out by 18
activists last week.
	   ``The Myanmar people want to live in peace and are angry with
the 18 foreigners,'' wrote Maung Pyi Tha, a pen name for a
government official, in a commentary in Monday's state-run New
Light of Myanmar newspaper.
	   ``The next time any destructionists or saboteurs try to disrupt
the country they will face not only the laws but the people who are
ready to prove their sense of duty,'' he wrote.
	   The same author wrote in a commentary on Saturday, that if he
had apprehended the activists he would have physically assaulted
them.
	   The activists _ six Americans, three Thais, three Indonesians,
three Malaysians, two Filipinos and an Australian _ were arrested
the day after the 10th anniversary of a failed nationwide democracy
uprising in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   They were handing out small red and gold cards that said:
	   ``Goodwill Message. We are your friends from around the world.
We have not forgotten you. We support your hopes for human rights
and democracy. Don't forget. Don't give up.''
	   On Friday, they were sentenced by a Myanmar court to five years
in prison with hard labor. The government deported them on
Saturday.
	   ``Because of the correct outlook of the people, the foreigners
had been unable to cause anarchy and unrest,'' Mondays' commentary
said. ``The fact that Myanmar people had caught those instigators
showed that Myanmar people are not foolish.''
	   Myanmar government officials frequently speak of
``annihilating,'' and ``crushing,'' the democratic opposition led
by 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   On Monday, Suu Kyi entered her sixth day of a stalemate with the
military over her right to meet members of her party outside
Yangon.
	   She and three colleagues were stopped in their van by the
authorities 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside the capital while
travelling to the city of Bassein.
	   The military is refusing to let them proceed, insisting there is
a threat of violence against her in Bassein.
	   The only physical attack on Suu Kyi came in Nov. 1996 by a mob
whose members said they were paid by the government.
	   This is the fourth time in two months Suu Kyi has been stopped
at the same roadblock. The government forcibly ended the last
incident by seizing Suu Kyi's car, forcibly restraining her and
driving her against her will back to Yangon.
	   Suu Kyi's party won 82 percent of the seats in parliament in a
1990 election the military refused to honor.
	   The NLD has set an Aug. 21 deadline for the government to
convene parliament.
	   Of the 385 NLD members elected in 1990, 181 have either been
imprisoned by the government, forced into exile, died or stripped
of their parliamentary status by the government.
	   The rest are living under harassment from the military, the NLD
has said.

Islamic banking faces challenge of global integration
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The high risks, lower profits and short-term
asset structures linked to banking according to Islamic law were
highlighted Monday at a conference seeking ways to make the system
practical within the global financial structure.
	   Islamic banking, which replaces interest with profit-sharing and
aims to adhere to other Muslim practices, ``has yet to realize its
full potential by overcoming various challenges it continues to
face,'' Syed Jaafar Aznan, a vice president at the Islamic
Development Bank based in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, said in the keynote
speech opening the two-day conference.
	   ``Some scholars have argued that one of the distinguishing
features of Islamic banking is risk sharing,'' said Jaafar. ``A
major challenge for Islamic banking and Islamic bankers is to
develop financing modes based on profit and loss-sharing, which do
not expose the Islamic banks to unnecessary risks.''
	   He outlined other problems, such as:
	   _ the inability of Islamic banks to punish defaulters by
charging a penalty;
	   _ entrepreneurs with promising projects prefer loans with fixed
charges and a greater share of profits and are reluctant to seek
Islamic bank financing, while those with doubtful projects prefer
the profit-sharing system;
	   _ without a lender of last resort, such as a central bank,
Islamic banks must keep higher reserves, cutting into profits;
	   _ Islamic banking is geared to short-term loans and short-term
assets.
	   ``The Islamic financial tools have largely been limited to
conventional instruments developed centuries ago,'' Jaafar said.
``We must examine what needs are being fulfilled by instruments of
modern finance, such as options, derivatives, hedging, etc., and
either adapt them to meet the Shariah (Islamic law) requirements or
invent Islamic alternatives to them.''
	   Jaafar said that the financial crises in Southeast Asia had
highlighted a disadvantage of conventional banking, which does not
always focus on the viability of a project, since the lender is
protected through security and interest payments.
	   ``Islamic banks, since their lending is on a profit and loss
sharing basis, out of necessity have to focus on the viability of
the operations they are financing,'' he said.
	   Abdullah Tarmugi, Singapore's minister-in-charge of Muslim
affairs, told the conference, ``Islamic banking cannot fully
replace conventional banking except, perhaps in some Muslim
countries.
	   ``The main challenge facing Islamic banking is to become more
sophisticated and competitive and to forge greater linkages with
the conventional banking system,'' he said.
	   The modern Islamic banking movement started in the early 1960s
in Malaysia and Egypt, and the Islamic Development Bank and the
Dubai Islamic Bank were established in 1975.
	   The International Association of Islamic Banks says that as of
1995, there were 186 registered Islamic banks and financial
institutions with total assets of dlrs 166 billion. Net profits
were about dlrs 1.27 billion.
	   No central bankers were among the approximately 200 delegates
from 19 countries at the Asia Islamic Banking and Finance
conference.

British backpacker's parents say no hope she is alive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ The parents of a British backpacker
missing in a southeast Queensland state forest said Monday they
have given up hope of their daughter being alive.
	   Lionel and Beth Bridge, from Carlisle, arrived from London on
Sunday to help police search for their 28-year-old daughter Celena,
a keen bushwalker and environmentalist.
	   Police said Bridge was last seen on July 12 when she left
Crystal Waters, a bush location west of Maleny in the Sunshine
Coast hinterland. It is about 45 miles (75 km) northwest of
Brisbane.
	   Bridge failed to appear at a birdwatcher's meeting at nearby
Kenilworth the following weekend.
	   Bridge told reporters Monday, ``We have no hope _ it's a
terrible thing to say but we've got to be realistic.''
	   Police said there were no indications of foul play and they
believe the young woman may have been hurt in an accident in the
state forest.

Singapore hospitals cut rates as economic crisis hurts revenue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Private hospitals in Singapore are reducing
their charges in response to falling occupancy as the economic
crisis reduces their revenues, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Four such hospitals _ including the two largest private
institutions, Mount Elizabeth and Gleneagles _ have dropped some of
their room rates by as much as 40 percent, according to The Straits
Times.
	   They are hoping to attract patients shying away from these
normally more expensive alternatives to government-run hospitals,
the report said.
	   Since the economic crisis took hold, occupancy at the 505-bed
Mount Elizabeth Hospital has averaged about 60 percent, the paper
reported.
	   A spokesman for Parkway Group Healthcare, which owns Mount
Elizabeth and Gleneagles hospitals, told the newspaper that the
cuts would lure more patients.
	   Lee Cheow Seng, the head of Thomson Medical Center, which has
also cut room rates, was quoted as saying that the measures were
``sensitive to the economic climate here in Singapore and the
region.''
	   Singapore boasts excellent public and private medical
facilities, which earn a significant portion of their revenue from
foreigners from neighboring countries who come specifically for
medical attention.
	   The private hospitals' cuts put some of their room rates below
those of government institutions, which subsidize many medical
costs, the report added.
	   However, private hospitals earn much of their profits from
itemized expenses other than room charges, and most costs are
higher than government facilities.

Nearly 100 people sick in Vietnam after eating rice cakes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Nearly 100 people, mostly children, came
down with food poisoning after eating rice cakes at a shop that
opened two days earlier, a local official said Monday.
	   Forty were hospitalized at the Thai Nguyen provincial general
hospital in northern Vietnam on Saturday, the official said. All
had been released by Sunday. Police were investigating the cause of
the incident.
	   Food poisoning is common in Vietnam, where pesticides often are
used to protect vegetables.
	   Earlier this year, more than 500 workers of a private company in
southern Dong Nai province were hospitalized after contracting food
poisoning in the company's canteen.

Cambodian villagers beat and tear robes off two Buddhist monks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Angry villagers tore the saffron
robes off two Buddhist monks and savagely beat them for allegedly
stealing about dlrs 600, a report said Monday.
	   Khoung Saothanh, deputy chief monk of Sumpong Phal pagoda just
outside of Phnom Penh, told the Cambodia Daily the pair were left
in charge of funds for a festival, but squandered the cash.
	   Police allegedly came to the pagoda to arrest the two monks,
Roth Tanak and Roth Chouk Chinda, but stood by as incensed
villagers handed down their own punishment.
	   One monk, Thath Lock, after watching the beating, called it
``completely against the rule of Buddhist principles,'' the paper
said.

	   DAMOUR, Lebanon (AP) _ Toufic Metni vividly remembers the terror
of fleeing as a 16-year-old from his hometown to escape marauding
Muslim fighters, an attack that killed 23 of his relatives.
	   It was nearly two decades before he got back to Damour.
	   ``We left as children and returned with children of our own,''
Metni, now a 38-year-old father of four, says of his generation's
travails during Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war.
	   He is among some 355,000 Lebanese _ 10 percent of the population
_ who fled or were driven from 900 communities in the
Christian-Muslim fighting.
	   The displaced remain a bitter reminder of the war. No more than
30 percent have gone home even though the accord that ended the
conflict gave priority to drawing refugees back and a plan to
accomplish that was adopted in 1993.
	   The lack of progress is blamed on political disputes, lack of
government funds and some people's unwillingness _ or fear _ to go
back.
	   Many Lebanese have strong emotional ties to home villages, and
legal ones, too, because people still must travel to their old
villages to do official chores like voting and registering birth
and deaths.
	   But what had been expected to unite Lebanese _ repatriation _
has caused division. In particular, Metni and other Christians,
losers in the war, complain they are not receiving as much help as
displaced Muslims or the Druse, an offshoot of Islam whose
followers were heavily in the fighting.
	   ``The civil war will never be over until the last displaced
person returns to his home and village,'' said Pierre Helou, who
leads the Maronite League, a Christian political group.
	   The government already has spent dlrs 500 million on moving
people back to their homes. But a government ministry created to
oversee repatriation says it needs dlrs 1.2 billion more to finish
the job.
	   The focal points of the ``return'' are the Chouf and Aley
districts of central Lebanon where Christians and Druse mainly
lived before the war. There, people were chased from once-shared
towns, and others lost homes when Druse took over villages that had
been exclusively Christian.
	   The man who led the eviction of the Christians _ Druse militia
chieftain Walid Jumblatt _ is now the government minister in charge
of bringing them back.
	   In early July, he blamed Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's
cash-strapped government for the slow progress, saying it is
concentrating on business and tourism development ``at the expense
of people's dignity.''
	   Hariri, who has earmarked dlrs 50 million for returning people
this year, responded by promising ``every displaced person will get
what he deserves until not a single one remains away from his
home.''
	   There is disagreement over how many displaced Lebanese have
returned home _ estimates range from 15 percent to 30 percent.
	   Hisham Nasseredine, director general of the Ministry of the
Displaced, says one reason for the diverging figures is that not
everyone who got compensation used it to go home.
	   ``Some people ... instead bought a car and a cellular phone,''
he said.
	   Survivors of the dead and returning families receive up to dlrs
20,000 each to rebuild houses and lives. Squatters also are paid to
abandon occupied homes, and some Druse have received compensation
to ``reconcile'' with returning Christian neighbors.
	   Metni, a public service employee, said the government aid is
merely ``symbolic'' in places like Damour, about 12 1/2 miles (20
kilometers) down the coast from Beirut, due to the extent of
destruction.
	   ``All that was left of our house was the garden,'' said Metni,
who has rebuilt his family's one-story home since moving back in
1994.
	   Half-completed buildings dot the town. The church is slowly
being repaired, and workers are installing new telephone lines. The
public school reopened last year with just 12 students; it now has
100.
	   Still, only about 8 percent of the town's pre-war population of
32,000 has returned. Among the returnees, many remain angry about
the past and anxious about the future.
	   Metni, for one, has kept the apartment he has in a Christian
suburb of Beirut. ``Who knows, we might need it one day,'' he said.
	   While anger remains in Christian Damour over the killings of
several hundred townspeople in 1976, there is bitterness, too, in
the Druse mountain town of Kfar Matta, site of a 1983 massacre by
Christian militiamen.
	   ``This town had 107 people killed. ... We are still awaiting the
political decision'' on government compensation, Kfar Matta's
mayor, Fouad Khaddaj, said on a recent TV talk show.
	   Some feel the problems of getting people back to their homes
will ease as fears and grudges fade. But attachment to land also
can diminish with time.
	   Afaf Salibi, 58, who fled to a Christian suburb of Beirut 15
years ago with her three children, thinks she will never return to
her hometown of Dibbiyeh.
	   ``Even if we had the money to fix our house, my children do not
want to go back,'' she said. ``Our home there means nothing to them
now.''

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The entourage of FBI agents grows in
Nairobi as more investigators try to learn whether the trail of
evidence from the deadly embassy bombing leads to a suspect whom
authorities have brought back from Pakistan.
	   The Pakistan Foreign Ministry and another government source said
Sunday that Mohammad Sadik Howaida was handed over to Kenyan
authorities last week, bypassing U.S. investigators in Pakistan.
	   The Pakistani national newspaper The News, quoting unnamed
government sources, said Sadik gave a determined confession to
planning the bombings and claimed the attack was sponsored by Osama
bin Laden, a Saudi harbored in neighboring Afghanistan who U.S.
officials have identified as a possible suspect.
	   The News said Sadik is a 34-year-old Palestinian engineer. He
reportedly told investigators six other conspirators slipped
through the Karachi airport Aug. 7 and apparently made it to
Afghanistan, where they had been told they would be congratulated
by bin Laden.
	   A Pakistani spokesman said Sadik was arrested on his arrival at
the Karachi airport from Nairobi on Aug. 7, the day twin bombings
at the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
killed 257 people and wounded at least 5,500 more.
	   A government source in Pakistan, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Sadik was returned Friday to Nairobi.
	   U.S. officials in Islamabad and Nairobi refused to discuss
Sadik.
	   ``This is a matter in which we are working very closely and very
hard with our Kenyan colleagues. I can't make any comment,'' said
the FBI's assistant agent-in-charge of the Nairobi investigation,
Hardrick Crawford. ``This is an ongoing investigation.''
	   U.S. officials have said that bin Laden, who has been vocal in
his hatred of the United States and is among the world's most
militant sponsors of terrorism, was a possible suspect in the
African bombings.
	   Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf said
immigration officials determined that Howaida's Yemeni passport was
forged, and he was interrogated by Pakistani officials.
	   A ministry statement identified Howaida as an ``Arab national''
without elaboration, a phrase that in Pakistan usually means
someone from the Middle East.
	   The mourning and the cleanup both continue in Nairobi.
	   American workers wearing helmets were going through the damaged
embassy building over the weekend, occasionally pulling out
magnifying glasses to inspect something before tossing it out the
window onto a heap below.
	   Newsweek magazine reported that investigators have found a
220-kilogram (100-pound) steel driveshaft believed to have belonged
to the pickup truck that carried the bomb to the embassy in
Nairobi. The shaft, found a kilometer (more than a half-mile) from
the site, contains part of the vehicle identification number, the
magazine said, quoting unidentified sources.
	   In Washington, FBI spokeswoman Debbie Weierman would not comment
on the report.
	   Even 10 days after the bombing, thousands of Kenyans still line
up at police barricades erected in a wide circle around the site,
gazing quietly at the wreckage. Others crowd around newspapers laid
out for sale on the sidewalk, reading headlines to learn the latest
developments in the investigation.
	   ``I am very much shocked,'' said Igonisius Mbaka, a 30-year-old
farmer from a village who was getting his first look at the damage
Sunday.
	   A memorial mound of flowers and shattered concrete slabs from
the wrecked buildings lies unattended now, behind the embassy in an
area where the public is no longer allowed.
	   The roses are closing up and fading and scrawled tributes and
messsages left there are yellowing, but their messages remain
poignant.
	   ``We mourn our brothers and sisters together the nation,'' read
one.
	   Kenyan police have said they detained about five people for
questioning in the case.
	   In a show of support for both East Africans and embassy staffers
abroad, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was planning
brief stops Tuesday in Dar es Salaam and Nairobi.

Angry and entrenched: Serbs fear ethnic Albanian control in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY192-193 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JANINA VODA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Day and night, the Serbs stand
guard. Hiding in the cornfield with their hunting rifles. Crouching
in the village trenches. Lurking in a camouflage blind in the
forest, a machine gun trained on an enemy just 200 yards (meters)
away.
	   The defense has been going on since 6:20 a.m. on June 29, when
the crack of gunfire jolted men from their beds.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army _ the secessionist ethnic Albanian
rebels, the ``terrorists'' _ had come to take the village.
	   With their rifles, and help from Serb police who eventually
arrived, villagers repelled the rebels. But the KLA just fled down
the road and seized the village next door. Since then the Serbs
have been on high alert, scared and furious that ethnic Albanians
might actually manage to take control _ not just of their houses
but of all of Kosovo province.
	   Janina Voda is 30 households, a speck of a place that has the
misfortune of abutting an unofficial line between regions inhabited
by Serbs and the KLA. But Serbs throughout Kosovo feel equally
entrenched.
	   They are the minority in Kosovo's 2 million people, outnumbered
9-to-1 by ethnic Albanians who overwhelmingly want independence for
the province on the southern tip of Serbia, the republic that
dominates Yugoslavia. President Slobodan Milosevic is determined to
keep Kosovo, and five months ago he sent troops to crush the KLA.
	   Still, Milosevic has offered Kosovo autonomy, which likely would
mean ethnic Albanians would govern. If that happens, some Serbs say
they'll leave. Serbs have lived in Kosovo since medieval times, and
land has been in Serb hands for generations. But ethnic Albanian
control is too bitter a pill to swallow.
	   ``I'm planning to get out, to leave everything behind,'' says a
41-year-old villager standing by the trenches, who gave only his
initials, S.J.
	   ``I'll go deeper into Serbia, where else? Where else can I save
my children's lives?''
	    &UR; ___
	   With the United States and Europe trying to broker autonomy
talks, many Serbs here express resentment, feeling that the world
doesn't care about the Serb side of the story. ``Everyone wants to
know about the ethnic Albanians, and no one asks about the Serbs,''
Kosovo police spokesman Col. Bozdar Filic complained recently.
	   Understanding the Serb side takes a brief history lesson, but
history in Kosovo is relative to who is talking. Albanians and
Serbs both claim to have settled here first, and each claims
oppression at the hands of the other.
	   For the Serbs, the trouble started in 1389 when the Turks
pummeled them on a Kosovo battlefield. The facts of this famous
trouncing are murky down to the question of whether it was even a
clear defeat. But more important than facts _ at least in Kosovo _
is what people THINK happened.
	   Some certainties: Turks ruled for five centuries until 1913,
when they pulled out and Kosovo returned to Serb control. Under
Yugoslav communist dictator Josip Broz Tito, ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo had autonomy. Fast forward to 1989 and Milosevic, who in a
nationalist fever revoked the autonomy, sacked thousands of
Albanians from jobs and ended Albanian-language teaching in state
schools.
	   Since then, the Albanians have boycotted Serb rule in protest _
creating an underground government and refusing to pay taxes or
vote in elections. Last year, the KLA began attacks on Serb police,
and war erupted in full on Feb. 28.
	   For Kosovo Albanians, the war is about Serb oppression of their
human rights. On the Serb side, the war is more about history,
about the 14th-century humiliation by the Muslim Turks and the
Albanians _ mostly Muslim _ who want once again to rob Serbs of
ancient lands.
	   Out in the cornfield, an old man waits gleefully to gun down KLA
rebels with his rifle.
	   ``We will make them do this,'' he says, moving his hand across
his chest in an Orthodox Christian cross.
	    &UR; ___
	   Sitting at their kitchen table around cups of Turkish coffee,
the Stankovic family grows infuriated by suggestions that ethnic
Albanians lack rights. In fact, the Stankovics argue, it is the
Albanians themselves who refuse to exercise the rights they have.
	   If the Albanians did not boycott elections, they could have 30
seats in Serbia's 230-seat parliament. And how dare Albanians not
pay taxes or work in Kosovo, drawing income instead from relatives
in Germany or Switzerland.
	   ``If they were willing to use their rights, they could have
everything they want and still respect the state,'' says Goran
Stankovic, a lawyer for a nearby coal mine. ``We, the minority, are
using our rights. They just refuse to accept anything Serb.''
	   His mother, Stanojka, is weeping.
	   ``Damn this world if you need to stay awake all night in the
trenches and fear for your life,'' she shouts. ``If my son goes
out, I don't know if he'll come back.''
	   Also at the table is Simo Spasic, a bull-necked family friend
who says the KLA kidnapped his brother. The rebels have admitted
kidnapping Serbs, and Spasic's brother is one of about 180 missing
people that the International Red Cross hopes to find.
	   ``They want to kill all the Christians left in Kosovo,'' Spasic
says. ``But even if they kill my brother, I would never leave.
Maybe I'd leave my village, but Kosovo, never.''
	   Spasic is already gone from his village, living since June in a
makeshift hut since the KLA took over Simovac _ the village down
the road. For four generations, his family has owned a red-brick
compound with plum and pear orchards.
	   A KLA commander now has his office there.

Fiji hails hero Singh
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; ADDS comment from Fijian Prime Minister, details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ Vijay Singh's U.S. PGA victory gave Fiji its
greatest moment in international sports, but his 800,000
compatriots were unable to witness his triumph.
	   Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka, under political pressure
because of the amount of time he spends playing golf, led the
tributes to Singh, 35.
	   ``Fiji today experiences one of its proudest sport achievements
ever,'' Rabuka said. ``The country rejoices in his success and we
know that this has not come without a lot of sacrifice. Vijay has
conquered the world and has made Fiji very proud.''
	   But Rabuka, who earlier this month was forced by opposition
pressure to order his government ministers to attend parliament
rather than play a scheduled golf tournament, was unable to watch
the final round at Salahee Country Club.
	   There was no local television coverage of the event in Fiji and
the sport's leading official here heard the final stages of Singh's
victory via a telephone call to the United States.
	   Sir Timoci Tuivaga, president of the Fiji Golf Club and the
country's Chief Justice, was called by a friend, Mahendra Singh,
who was watching the coverage in the United States. Mahendra held
the telephone to the television so Sir Timoci could hear the
commentary and Vijay Singh's interview.
	   ``It's thrilling news,'' Sir Timoci said. ``This is the highest
international sports achievement ever by a Fiji Islander sportsman.
It's the biggest win of all for Fiji _ a wonderful thing.''
	   Singh started his involvement in golf as a caddie at the Nadi
Airport Golf Club. Club president Krishna Chetty also heard second
hand in a phone call from a friend as the tournament wound up
Monday morning Fiji time.
	   ``We are very proud he has finally won a major and we hope other
Fijian golfers will emulate him,'' Chetty said.
	   Vijay Singh's father, Mohan Singh, watched the final round from
his home in Te Aroha, New Zealand.
	   ``It was wonderful to see him win a major tournament,'' Mohan
Singh said. ``He has been hitting the ball good. He spoke to me a
few days ago and seemed confident. I wished him all the best and
told him to keep his head down and just keep hitting the ball, and
he's done it.''
	   Vijay Singh shot a final round of two-under 68 to win by two
shots over American Steve Stricker.
	   Mohan Singh moved to New Zealand during the 1980s after a long
career as an engineer at Nadi airport. He was once the captain of
the Nadi Airport Golf Club, he was often accompanied on the course
by his son.
	   ``When Vijay was 10, he started caddying for me, pulling my
trundler, and later he began hitting golf balls,'' Mohan Singh
said.
	   ``He was hitting the ball well on a tough course and I knew
someday he would be good golfer, but I never thought he would win a
major tournament in the United States.''
	   Fiji has 10 golf courses, with only three of an international
standard. There are about 2,000 registered golfers in Fiji
including 19 professionals.

China builds up last dike protecting top oil field from floods
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Soldiers piled sandbags in a rush to build up the
last defense of China's largest oil field from the raging waters of
the Nen River on Monday.
	   The river already broke through two other dikes protecting the
oil field and Daqing, a city of 2.3 million people. The third
embankment was the last chance to save the oil field from a flood
that would bring disastrous losses.
	   Meanwhile, farther south in central China, the Yangtze River
reached a new record height of 45.22 meters (149.2 feet) Monday at
Shashi city.
	   Officials had warned that if the river went over 45 meters
(148.5 feet) it may be necessary to dynamite dikes and deliberately
flood an area south of Shashi where 500,000 people live to
safeguard cities farther down the river.
	   This summer's floods _ the worst on the Yangtze in 44 years _
have killed more than 2,000 people nationwide and left millions
homeless. The new crest threatened waterlogged dikes that protect
cities and farms downstream.
	   Near the Daqing oil field in the northeast, soldiers, officers
and oil field workers piled sandbags two meters (6.6 feet) high
along a five-kilometer (3.1 mile) embankment, but still needed to
double the height, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   About 11,600 oil workers and their families were trapped without
power, food or water at two large state farms on the Nen River,
Xinhua said. An evacuation was slowed by a lack of boats, it said.
	   Flooding at Daqing closed 527 oil wells, reducing output by
6,821 tons last week. Daqing has 25,000 wells that produced 60.9
million tons of oil last year.
	   The second dike protecting the oil field collapsed on Saturday
despite efforts by 2,000 soldiers to pile up sandbags. Thousands of
people had to be evacuated.
	   ``I heard people start to scream and run around blindly when
they learned the dike was breached,'' the China Daily quoted Liu
Hai, a farmer living 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) from the second dike,
as saying. The paper said he had been walking for a day trying to
find his wife and children.
	   No casualties have been reported yet in the Nen River floods,
the paper said.
	   The third dike, 15 kilometers (nine miles) east of the one that
collapsed Saturday night, would be a ``life-and-death defense'' for
the city of Daqing, the China Daily quoted Wang Yang, an army
captain in charge of the dike, as saying.
	   Meanwhile, the level of China's mightiest river, the Yangtze,
continued to rise slowly. Some 2.7 million civilians and soldiers
worked on embankments of the river to protect farms and cities from
floods.
	   ``The situation is still extremely serious. There can be no
letup,'' the Wenhui Daily reported Sunday.
	   In Inner Mongolia in north China, authorities were trying to
rescue 76,000 people stranded by the flooded Ulyji Muren River,
Xinhua said. About 70,000 other people cut off by the river had
been rescued, it said.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Celebrating Indonesia's national day,
flag-bearing officers strutted at the presidential palace Monday
while traditional dancers sashayed for political prisoners in a
jail yard.
	   From five-star hotels to slum shacks, red and white Indonesian
flags and banners festooned the capital, a festive display belying
the economic hardship that millions are suffering.
	   Police and soldiers were posted at intersections following
rumors that riots might break out during the celebrations, but the
streets were quiet.
	   With Indonesia's economic turmoil stripping people of jobs and
driving up prices, fears linger of more deadly unrest like the
riots in May that helped oust former President Suharto.
	   Some ethnic Chinese, whose shops and homes were targeted in the
Jakarta upheaval that killed about 1,200 people, left the country
amid rumors of violence on Monday.
	   Despite the uncertainty, President B.J. Habibie presided over a
show of pomp on the lawn of his palace, saluting phalanxes of
soldiers who paraded to brass band tunes and waved to choirs of
schoolchildren.
	   Foreign ambassadors and government officials were on hand for a
flag-raising ceremony. Indonesia declared independence from Dutch
colonial rule in 1945. The Dutch left four years later after
failing to quell nationalist forces in a war.
	   Suharto, whose hold on power was dislodged by riots over price
increases and student protests, did not attend the ceremony.
	   On Saturday, Habibie made a marathon speech to Parliament in
which he apologized for widespread human rights abuses during
Suharto's 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   At Jakarta's Cipinang jail, a justice ministry official
announced sentence reductions for some inmates.
	   But some political prisoners there said Habibie should prove his
willingness to guide Indonesia toward democracy by releasing all
jailed opponents of Suharto. So far, he has released dozens.
	   ``We've been treated by the Habibie regime as a commodity,''
said pro-democracy activist Budiman Sudjatmiko, whose 13-year
prison term for subversion was cut by one month.
	   Budiman is head of the People's Democratic Party, a political
party that was banned under Suharto but has since been legalized.
	   To mark independence day, traditional dancers from western Java
island entertained about 200 prisoners, who later played games,
climbing up a flagpole to grab prizes, such as T-shirts or bottles
of water.
	   In a snub to Habibie, prominent opposition figure Megawati
Sukarnoputri, who is the eldest daughter of Indonesia's founding
President Sukarno, staged her own independence ceremony in Jakarta.
	   ``It's better for me to be with the people together, feeling all
the difficulties and concerns,'' Megawati told several hundred
supporters, some wearing headbands with slogans that read
``Reform.''
	   Megawati, who urged democratic change when Suharto was in power,
was ousted as leader of the minority Indonesian Democratic Party in
June 1996 by a government-backed party faction.

Reports: Police question two men on suspicion of extorting airline
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo police on Monday began questioning two men on
suspicion of extorting as much as 20 million yen (dlrs 140,000)
from Japan Airlines Co., news reports said Monday.
	   The alleged extortion was reportedly in return for promising to
ensure trouble-free shareholders' meetings for the airline, the
Nihon Keizai newspaper said without quoting sources.
	   JAL, Japan's largest airline, is the latest company to be named
in a crackdown on racketeering that caused the arrest last year of
executives from top companies such as Nomura Securities Co.,
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
	   Authorities plan to formally arrest the alleged racketeers once
they have gathered sufficient evidence, the newspaper said.
	   A number of JAL executives have already admitted involvement in
the scheme and their case will soon be forwarded to the Public
Prosecutor's Office, the report said.
	   One of the two being questioned allegedly heads a racketeer
group, while the other is the president of an artificial flower
company which the authorities believe to be controlled by the
notorious Sumiyoshi-kai underworld syndicate, the Asahi newspaper
said.
	   JAL is suspected of hiding payments to the racketeers under the
pretext of leasing artificial flowers, according to the Asahi.
	   Police suspect the men helped manage JAL shareholders' meetings
since 1990, the Asahi said.

Singapore considering stiffer penalties for litterbugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Clean-conscious Singapore will probably
increase the punishment for littering because the number caught
strewing trash or dropping cigarette butts is sharply increasing, a
newspaper reported Monday.
	   Under current law, litterbugs are either fined or forced to
clean public areas wearing bright neon vests under a penalty
referred to as a Corrective Work Order.
	   Since this mildly humiliating practice was introduced in 1993,
about 2,000 people have served such a sentence, according to The
Straits Times.
	   But Singapore's Environment Ministry is now considering
combining these punishments, and increasing the fine and duration
of the Corrective Work Order, according to the report.
	   The ministry caught 5,858 people littering during the first half
of 1998, nearly triple the number apprehended in the same period
last year, according to the newspaper.
	   The maximum fine for the first littering offense is 1,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 570), and 2,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs
1140) for subsequent violations.
	   Corrective Work Orders range from half an hour to three hours of
collecting trash in public locales.

Russia devalues ruble
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After weeks of financial turmoil, Russia announced
Monday that it will devalue the shaky national currency, the ruble.
	   The Central Bank has revised the corridor in which it supports
the ruble, from about 6.3 to the dollar to 9.5 to the dollar, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The government also imposed a 90-day moratorium on the payment
of ruble-denominated foreign debt.
	   A ruble devaluation has been widely rumored, in part because the
government faces heavy debt payments in coming days and weeks.
	   Additional details were not immediately available.

Filipino-Chinese protest rapes and killings in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Hundreds of Filipino-Chinese, many of
them school children, protested Monday in front of the Indonesian
Embassy to denounce rapes and killings of ethnic Chinese women in
Indonesia during unrest in May.
	   ``We want justice. We want justice,'' chanted more than 500
demonstrators during an hour-long protest rally coinciding with the
53rd anniversary of Indonesian independence from Dutch colonial
rule. The embassy was closed for the holiday.
	   The protest was spearheaded by members of the Philippines
Coalition against Atrocities in Indonesia, composed mainly of
Filipinos of Chinese ancestry.
	   ``We are here to pray that justice be given to the victims of
the May riots in Indonesia specially against the
Indonesian-Chinese,'' said Gina Ang, the principal of a Chinese
school in suburban Pasig City.
	   Hundreds of uniform-clad children from five Chinese schools were
among the protesters. They were joined by Buddhist monks and Roman
Catholic priests and nuns.
	   ``We are here to disturb, to disturb Indonesia's conscience,''
said Rev. Roberto Burgos. ``Only people without consciences will
rape women.''
	   An Indonesian security officer, who tried to stop the protest,
was loudly booed. ``We are Filipinos. We are not Indonesians. You
cannot stop our protest,'' the demonstrators told the officer.
	   He had to be escorted by rally leaders to stop some protesters
from trying to hurt him. At least on protester hit the security
officer with a placard before he could enter the embassy compound.
	   Women's groups in Indonesia allege 168 women and girls were
raped during May's riots, with many of them ethnic Chinese who were
targeted for their affluence. Thousands of Chinese-owned houses and
buildings were ransacked and burned.
	   While Chinese make up only about four percent of Indonesia's
population, they control much of the economy and have been targeted
as scapegoats for the country's financial crisis.
	   Indonesia, the world's fourth-most-populous nation, has been hit
the hardest by Asia's economic meltdown.
	   China has demanded the Indonesian government take firm action to
protect ethnic Chinese citizens, and protesters in Taiwan, Hong
Kong and the United States have called for those responsible to be
arrested.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks decline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon bond and currency &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Monday,
following concerns Friday in New York trading about economic
stability in Asia and Russia. Tokyo stock prices fell.
	   The dollar bought 146.47 yen as of mid-afternoon, up 1.59 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo and above its late New York rate of
146.35 yen.
	   Persistent doubts about Russia's currency and economy led to a
surge in the dollar against the yen and other currencies in New
York on Friday, traders said.
	   Concerns about a new round of sell-offs in Southeast Asian
currency and stock markets also sent investors scurrying for the
safe haven of the greenback.
	   But the dollar's gains faltered in Tokyo after Japanese
officials signaled their readiness to prop up their currency.
	   Eisuke Sakakibara, a vice finance minister known as ``Mr. Yen''
for his influence on currency markets, warned authorities were
ready to intervene should the dollar rise to 147 yen.
	   That was quickly followed by comments by Haruhiko Kuroda, the
head of the International Bureau at the Ministry of Finance, who
said Japan remains committed to defending its currency.
	   ``We have been saying we will act in foreign exchange markets
appropriately, as needed,'' Kuroda said, adding that the dollar has
grown too strong against the yen.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average fell below the psychologically significant 15,000-yen
level for the first time since mid-June.
	   The Nikkei dropped 329.27 points, or 2.18 percent, to close at
14,794.66 _ its lowest since June 17. On Friday, the Nikkei index
sank 258.09 points, or 1.68 percent.
	   The market's dive stemmed, in part, from a worsening of
sentiment following a decline in U.S. stocks traded on Wall Street
Friday, traders said.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 34.50 points, or
0.4 percent, to 8,425.00, its lowest close since late February and
9.8 percent below its peak of 9,337.97 on July 17.
	   Investors are also worried about the fate of a set of bills
designed to stabilize Japan's shaky financial system, said Eiji
Tomaru, a manager at the investor information group at Kankaku
Securities Co.
	   Opposition lawmakers have criticized the government's banking
legislation as a taxpayer-funded bailout which doesn't punish inept
executives.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section tumbled 16.77 points, or 1.43 percent, to 1,152.03.
The TOPIX fell 12.91 points, or 1.09 percent on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.160 percent from Friday's finish of 1.175
yen, pushing its price up to 112.04 yen from 111.94 yen.

Thorpe adds butterfly to games program
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia's 15-year-old world swimming
champion Ian Thorpe has set himself up for a hectic Commonwealth
Games program by deciding to contest the 200-meter butterfly for
the first time at a major meet.
	   Thorpe has succeeded as a freestyler, having won the 400-meter
world title earlier this year in Perth. He also holds the
Commonwealth record for the 200-meter freestyle.
	   Thorpe is not even ranked in the top 50 in the world for the
200-meter butterfly but has been selected as the third Australian
in the event for the Sept. 10-21 Commonwealth Games in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia.
	   ``We were approached about swimming the 200 fly. That's the only
reason we're swimming it,'' said Thorpe's coach Doug Frost. ``It
wasn't through choice to go after it and chase it. We're just
swimming it because the opportunity was there and it's after his
main events.''
	   Thorpe, who is younger than his shoe size of 16, will contest
six events in KL: the fly; 100-, 200- and 400-meter freestyle; and
two relays.
	   Thorpe recorded his Commonwealth record of one minute, 47.24
seconds in the 200-meter freestyle at the Commonwealth trials,
beating world champion Michael Klim and showing the form which many
believe have him poised to break Italian Giorgio Lamberti's
nine-year-old world mark of 1:46.69.

Finance Minister calls for transparency in international markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's finance minister called
Monday for transparency in the international financial system,
saying global players should adhere to the same rules they
advocate.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, who is also deputy prime minister, said it was
``lopsided'' to demand transparency and disclosure from poor
countries and not from wealthier economies.
	   ``Why must poorer countries accept these measures while the
international community is absolved of it?'' Anwar said at a forum
for Islamic leaders in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Malaysian leaders have often blamed Western currency speculators
for plotting to destroy the Southeast Asian economy, once counted
among the world's fastest growing.
	   Malaysia has tried a range of measures to boost its shrinking
economy. The government has estimated the economy will contract by
up to two percent this year. Independent analysts predict it could
be as much as 5 percent.
	   ``Hedge funds and currency traders have to accept the same
rules. You want disclosure, you disclose where the funds are
from,'' Anwar said, adding that it was unlikely affluent economies
would initiate reform of the international financial system.
	   ``We don't expect them to change the ground rules. To them, it's
not a moral issue, it's a dollar issue,'' Anwar said.
	   At the same time, Anwar said that regional economies should not
be complacent as poverty, corruption and excesses continue to
prevail in several of the countries hard-hit by the Asian crisis.
	   Overcoming these weaknesses would ``continue to be a daunting
task,'' he said.

Russia devalues ruble

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After weeks of financial turmoil, Russia sharply
devalued the shaky national currency, the ruble, on Monday, in a
move expected to cause hardship for Russian consumers and rattle
international markets.
	   The Central Bank lowered its target exchange rate for the ruble
from about 6.3 to the dollar to 9.5 to the dollar.
	   President Boris Yeltsin interrupted his vacation and headed to
the Kremlin for a crisis meeting with his prime minister, Sergei
Kiriyenko.
	   A ruble devaluation had been widely rumored, in part because the
government faces heavy debt payments in coming days and weeks.
	   The government also forced a restructuring of short-term debts,
saying it would halt payment on government treasury bills and
impose a 90-day moratorium on payments of ruble-denominated foreign
debt.
	   The devaluation was expected to raise the prices of imports sold
in Russia, which account for a large percentage of Russian consumer
goods, including more than half the food sold in stores.
	   However, it was also expected to ease the government's budget
crunch, making it possible to pay months of wages and pensions owed
to hard-pressed Russians.
	   Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin said the government actions
are designed to help Russian citizens and domestic producers and
hurt ``financial speculators'' who have been fleeing Russian
markets for months, Interfax said.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov said the devaluation would
also help spur investment in Russian industry.
	   The devaluation was expected to lead to the collapse of many
Russian commercial banks, who are over-dependent on now devalued
ruble assets. However, the government and Central Bank said they
would pool the resources of leading banks to limit the damage.
	   They also proposed legislation to strengthen controls over
Russian financial markets in an effort to halt further capital
flight.

China builds up last dike protecting top oil field from floods
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yangtze receding, official saying no need to
explode dikes; ADDS tiger evacuation. Edits to tighten.
 &UR; By RENEE SCHOOF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Soldiers piled sandbags in a rush Monday to build
up the last defense of China's largest oil field from the raging
waters of the Nen River.
	   The river broke through two other dikes protecting the oil field
and Daqing, a northeastern city of 2.3 million people. The third
embankment was the last chance to save the oil field from a flood
that would bring disastrous losses.
	   To the south, in central China, the Yangtze River reached a new
record height of 45.22 meters (149.2 feet) Monday morning at Shashi
city, home to a half million people.
	   Officials earlier warned that if the river went over 45 meters
(148.5 feet) dikes might be dynamited to deliberately flood an area
south of Shashi and safeguard cities down river. But a flood
control official said the water level dropped slightly later
Monday.
	   ``There's been a turn for the better,'' said the official who
gave his surname, Xu. He predicted the water would not rise so high
to make destroying dikes necessary.
	   This summer's floods are the worst on the Yangtze in 44 years.
Some 2.7 million civilians and soldiers worked on embankments of
the river to protect farms and cities from floods.
	   Near the Daqing oil field, 1,000 kilometers (600 miles)
northeast of Beijing, oil workers and soldiers worked day and night
piling sandbags two meters (six feet) high along a five-kilometer
(three-mile) embankment by Monday, but they needed to double the
height, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   About 11,600 oil workers and their families were trapped without
power, food or water at two large state farms on the Nen River, and
their evacuation was slowed by a lack of boats, Xinhua said.
	   Flooding at Daqing closed 527 oil wells, reducing output by more
than 2 million gallons (7.6 million liters) last week. Daqing has
25,000 wells that produced 17.9 billion gallons (68 billion liters)
of oil last year.
	   The second dike protecting the oil field collapsed on Saturday
despite efforts by 2,000 soldiers to pile up sandbags. More than
2,000 people were evacuated.
	   ``I heard people start to scream and run around blindly when
they learned the dike was breached,'' the China Daily quoted Liu
Hai, a farmer living 3 kilometers (two miles) from the second dike,
as saying.
	   The third dike, 15 kilometers (nine miles) east of the one that
collapsed Saturday night, would be a ``life-and-death defense'' for
Daqing, China Daily quoted Wang Yang, an army captain in charge of
the dike, as saying.
	   In Inner Mongolia in north China, authorities were trying to
rescue 76,000 people stranded by the flooded Ulyji Muren River,
Xinhua said. About 70,000 other people cut off by the river had
been rescued, it said.
	   Rescuers also moved 52 Siberian tigers from a breeding and
research center near Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province
east of Daqing, to another station of the center 250 kilometers
(150 miles) away.
	   The tiger preserve, a tourist attraction, is near the Songhua
River, which is expected to crest at Harbin on Wednesday bringing
the worst flooding in 50 years.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ American millionaire adventurer Steve
Fossett gave a thumbs up to his rescuers and said he was fine
Monday, hours after the balloon he was trying to fly around the
world crashed into the sea, authorities said.
	   Fossett has been in regular radio contact with a Royal
Australian Air Force Hercules C-130 since about lunchtime Monday,
when a rescue plane from Sydney reached the balloon crash site in
the Coral Sea, east of Australia.
	   ``He reports being fine,'' Australian Maritime Safety Authority
spokesman Robin Poke told The Associated Press.
	   A French military plane dropped a 15-man life raft to Fossett at
about 8.40 a.m. (2240 GMT Sunday) Monday, after reaching the site
near the Chesterfield islands, about 500 miles (800 km) off
Australia's east coast, the French Navy in Noumea, New Caledonia,
said.
	   The French plane circled Fossett until its fuel began to run
low, then headed back to its home base in Noumea, Poke said.
	   ``He has been waving to the aircraft as they fly overhead,
giving the thumbs-up,'' said New Zealand defense forces spokesman
Lt.-Cmdr. Bill Morley.
	   The New Zealand navy tanker Endeavour is one of three vessels
rushing to the site. An Australian ketch, the Atlanta, was closest
and skipper Laurie Piper said he expected to reach Fossett by about
7:00 p.m. local time (0900 GMT).
	   ``We'll have a dinghy with an outboard ready to launch,'' Piper
told The Associated Press by radio phone.
	   ``We'll pick him up as soon as we get there and bring him on
board, give him a cup of coffee, wrap him up and put a good feed in
him.''
	   Endeavor was about three hours behind Atlanta and was due at the
site at about midnight Monday (1400 GMT), Morley said.
	   Fossett had been two-thirds of the way to his goal. The balloon
was 500 miles (800 km) off the Australian coast heading toward its
final destination of Argentina, in South America, when contact was
lost, said Alan Blount, director of mission control for the journey
at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.
	   Seas in the area were relatively calm but the crew was concerned
because the area is near a coral reef that could be full of sharks.
It was shortly after midnight Australian time when the balloon ran
into trouble.
	   Australian Maritime Rescue Center spokesman Brian Hill told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio that Fossett came down near the
Bellona Reefs, an uncharted region which could make ship navigation
and the rescue difficult.
	   About five hours before Fossett's warning locator sounded,
meteorologist Bob Rice had cautioned the balloonist he was
approaching strong thunderstorms _ and that they would be nearly
impossible to avoid.
	   ``There's a good chance that there might have been a lightning
hit on the capsule,'' Rice said. ``But these balloons are very
strong. It's just too early to know what happened.''
	   Fossett was equipped with a wet suit and life raft, and the
capsule of the balloon is seaworthy, but not leakproof.
	   Fossett still had to cross a massive stretch of the Pacific
Ocean between Australia and Argentina and had at least another five
days of travel before he was expected to reach South America, from
where he took off on Aug. 7.
	   Fossett, from Chicago, was making his fourth attempt to fly
around the world. He has also run marathons, climbed mountains and
raced in the Iditarod dog sled race in Alaska.

East Timorese rebel leaders gets four months cut from sentence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The government on Monday cut four
months from the 20-year sentence of East Timor's rebel chief,
resisting international pressure to free him.
	   After the announcement, guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao
reiterated a call for President B.J. Habibie to release all
political prisoners to prove his commitment to democratic change.
	   ``If this is a regime of reform, Habibie has to release all
political prisoners without preconditions or criteria,'' Gusmao
told reporters in Jakarta's Cipinang prison.
	   Gusmao was arrested in 1992 for fighting against Indonesian
control of East Timor. Under former President Suharto, Indonesia
invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed it a year
later.
	   In an annual tradition, Indonesia freed dozens of prisoners
nationwide and granted sentence reductions to others to mark
independence day Monday. In East Timor, authorities freed 17
prisoners and cut the terms of 220 others, all of them criminals.
	   But the government has refused calls from international human
rights groups and foreign leaders, including European lawmakers and
South African President Nelson Mandela, to free Gusmao.
	   The government has indicated that Gusmao will not be freed until
a peace settlement had been reached over the disputed territory.
	   Habibie has offered a measure of autonomy for East Timor and
wants to maintain Indonesian authority. Gusmao and other East
Timorese activists have demanded a vote on independence for the
territory of 800,000 people.
	   ``Autonomy is only a process for a transitional period,'' Gusmao
said Monday. ``In the end, we have to find out the general view of
East Timorese through a referendum.''

Mubarak: Justice is guarantee against terrorism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak condemned the
bombings of the U.S. embassies in East Africa and said that justice
was the only guarantee against terrorism, Egyptian newspapers
reported Monday.
	   It was the president's first public comments on the explosions
in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, that killed 257
people and injured more than 5,500. Among the dead were 12
Americans.
	   ``Justice is the real guarantee against terrorism because
feelings of injustice leads to a state of boiling that cannot be
controlled, which then lead to desperate acts,'' the
Arabic-language Mayo quoted Mubarak as saying.
	   Mubarak did not elaborate, but he appeared to be speaking about
justice for the Arabs.
	   The Arabs have widely criticized U.S. policies in the Middle
East, accusing the Clinton administration of failing to pressure
Israel to follow through on peace deals with the Palestinians and
seriously damaging the peace process.
	   There also has been criticism of U.N. sanctions on Libya, Iraq
and Sudan which have caused economic hardship for the people of
those countries.
	   Mubarak added that acts of violence ``will not solve problems or
reach an objective except bloodletting.''
	   After the explosions, Mubarak dispatched a ton of medical
supplies and 15 top doctors Kenya to help the victims of the
embassy bombing there.

Culminating months of financial turmoil, Russia devalues ruble

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After weeks of financial turmoil, Russia sharply
devalued the shaky national currency on Monday in a move expected
to cause hardship for Russian consumers and rattle international
markets.
	   The Central Bank lowered its target exchange rate for the ruble
by about 50 percent _ from about 6.3 to the dollar to 9.5 to the
dollar.
	   President Boris Yeltsin interrupted his vacation and headed to
the Kremlin for a crisis meeting with his prime minister, Sergei
Kiriyenko.
	   A ruble devaluation had been widely rumored, in part because the
government faces heavy debt payments in coming days and weeks.
	   ``The government's action is an effective and timely response to
the very grave financial situation which threatened the nation's
political and economic stability,'' said Anatoly Chubais, Russia's
liaison with international lenders who is widely respected in the
West.
	   ``The Russian leadership has taken these steps only after
exhausting other options,'' Chubais said, blaming the country's
financial straits on the Asian crisis and a recent drop in world
oil prices.
	   The government also forced a restructuring of short-term debts,
saying it would halt payment on government treasury bills and
impose a 90-day moratorium on payments of ruble-denominated foreign
debt.
	   Chubais insisted that the government was not defaulting.
	   ``We are not reneging on our debts,'' he said. ``We realize that
many of our partners will feel uncomfortable, but any hesitation on
our part would cost them far more.''
	   ``I hope the government's steps will be understood both in
Russia and abroad,'' he said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The devaluation is a tricky political move for the government.
It will sharply raise the prices of imports sold in Russia, which
account for a large percentage of Russian consumer goods, including
more than half the food sold in stores.
	   However, it was also expected to ease the government's budget
crunch, making it possible to pay months of wages and pensions owed
to hard-pressed Russians.
	   Government officials put the best spin on the situation. Central
Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin said the government action was ``aimed
at protecting Russian citizens and domestic producers.''
	   ``The government has decided to act in favor of them and against
traders in the hard currency and bond markets,'' he said according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The money tied up in stock speculation ``will now be directed to
the real sector of the economy and serve the interests of all
Russians,'' Dubinin said.
	   The devaluation was expected to lead to the collapse of many
Russian commercial banks, who are over-dependent on now devalued
ruble assets. The government and Central Bank said they would pool
the resources of leading banks to limit the damage.
	   They also proposed legislation to strengthen controls over
Russian financial markets in an effort to halt further capital
flight.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who has been critical of the
government's economic policies, announced that the parliament is
likely to agree to hold an emergency session next week.
	   Yeltsin has called on the opposition-dominated parliament to
convene in a special session to endorse austerity measures demanded
by the International Monetary Fund and other lenders. In the
absence of parliamentary approval, Yeltsin has imposed many of the
measures by decree.

NATO flexs military muscle to help contain Kosovo crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ As a dozen jet fighters soared overhead,
about 1,700 troops from the United States and other countries began
a five-day military exercise Monday to show the alliance's
readiness to contain the crisis in neighboring Kosovo province.
	   Troops from 14 nations will conduct training for parachute
supply drops, vehicle and foot patrols, marksmanship and other
non-offensive drills in the Albanian mountains. Ten other nations
have sent observers.
	   Navy Capt. Steve Burnette, spokesman for the exercise, said the
operation, ``Cooperative Assembly 1998,'' was to ``provide
stability and help contain a regional crisis.''
	   The Americans and Europeans fear the fighting in Serbia's Kosovo
province, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence,
could spill over into neighboring countries with large Albanian
communities.
	   Hundreds have died in fighting in Kosovo since Serb police
cracked down on the separatist KLA in February.
	   Although the Albanian government supports a peaceful solution to
the crisis, rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army maintain bases in
the north of the country, from where they smuggle arms and
ammunition into Serbia.
	   The Albanians here are struggling restore the structures of
government, including effective internal security, after last
year's nationwide riots which exploded following the collapse of
pyramid investment schemes which bankrupted much of the population.
	   As military bands played the national anthems of participating
countries, a dozen jets from six nations flew overhead in a display
of military power.
	   Despite NATO's commitment to stability here, the exercise began
as American diplomats and their families were leaving Albania as a
precaution following the attacks on the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, which killed 257 people.
	   Washington has also warned Americans against traveling to
Albania and offered to assist any of its 890 citizens registered
with the embassy to leave the country.
	   Recent reports that Albanian and U.S. authorities cooperated in
arresting at least five Egyptians in Albania who were suspected of
international terrorist links has heightened fears over the safety
of American citizens.

Roche announces 3 percent rise in half-year profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss pharmaceutical group Roche on
Monday announced that its first-half net profit rose 3 percent on
the previous year to 2.5 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 1.95 billion).
	   January-June net profit in 1997 was 2.43 billion Swiss francs
(dlrs 1.63 billion).
	   ``The strengthening of operations as a result of the acquisition
of Boehringer Mannheim and Tastemaker and above-average growth in
pharmaceuticals and diagnostics sales had a positive impact on
operating profit,'' Roche said in a statement.
	   In May 1997, Roche announced the acquisition of Corange Ltd.,
the parent of diagnostics company Boehringer Mannheim and
orthopedics unit DePuy, with DePuy being considered a non-core
activity.
	   The group added that the integration of Boehringer Mannheim is
largely complete.
	   In July this year, Roche announced the sale of that unit to
Johnson and Johnson of the United States for dlrs 2.9 billion.
	   Excluding DePuy, Roche's group sales in the first half totaled
12.53 billion francs (dlrs 8.4 billion), up 35 percent from 9.3
billion (dlrs 6.2 billion) francs in the same period of the
previous year.

Report: Japan commits public funds to bail out ailing bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Seeking to soothe concerns about the nation's
banking system, Japan is willing to use public funds to help
Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. take over ailing Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan Ltd., a news report said Monday.
	   The two banks had announced a merger in June, but rumors that
Sumitomo may be getting cold feet as it learns the true extent of
LTCB's bad loans have sent LTCB's shares to record lows.
	   The government has decided to use funds originally earmarked for
protecting depositors to ensure that LTCB stays solvent as it
merges with Sumitomo, the Yomiuri newspaper said in its interactive
edition.
	   To receive the support, LTCB must present a restructuring plan
as soon as this week that includes steps to shut down money-losing
subsidiaries and cut back foreign operations, the report said.
	   An LTCB spokesman said he couldn't confirm the report.
	   LTCB was once a symbol of Japanese finance, providing long-term
loans to industry as Japan began its economic ascent from the ashes
of World War II. But as liberalization has allowed companies to go
directly to the bond market for funding, LTCB has failed to find a
new purpose.
	   LTCB's shares have fallen as low as 37 yen in the last week.
They closed Monday at 41 yen, up 1 yen.

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Most U.S. Embassy personnel were
leaving Pakistan and other Americans were urged to join them Monday
after a suspect in the East African embassy bombings was caught in
Pakistan and turned over to Kenyan authorities.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland said all but about 50 of
the usual contingent of nearly 120 in the Islamabad embassy and
consulates in Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar would leave under
security orders from the State Department. They and their families
will begin leaving Tuesday, he said.
	   ``American citizens currently in Pakistan are urged ... to
consider seriously departing Pakistan,'' the embassy added in a
statement. It noted airports were open and commercial flights
available, but added the embassy was arranging additional flights.
	   Figures on the numbers of Americans other than embassy staff in
Pakistan were not immediately available.
	   In Washington Sunday, the State Department updated its
``worldwide caution'' for Americans, warning specifically against
``all travel to Pakistan .'' The State Department issued a similar
warning hours after the Aug. 7 embassy explosions in Nairobi, Kenya
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and cited the potential for more
threats.
	   The revised worldwide caution referred to ``subsequent threats''
without elaboration. Hoagland refused to say whether a specific
threat had prompted the Pakistani warning.
	   Americans in Pakistan have been advised to be on the alert since
last November, when four American oil workers were gunned down in
the southern port city of Karachi following the conviction of
Pakistani Mir Aimal Kasi in the United States in the 1993 killing
of two CIA agents. In March, cement barricades were erected on the
roads leading to the high-walled U.S. Embassy compound in
Islamabad.
	   In a brief statement Sunday, Pakistani Foreign Ministry
spokesman Tariq Altaf said a man identified as Mohammad Sadik
Howaida arrived at the Karachi airport from Nairobi on Aug. 7, the
day of African bombings that killed 257 people. Immigration
officials suspected Howaida's Yemeni passport was forged. He was
interrogated by Pakistani officials who determined he had some link
to the African bombings and handed him over to Kenyan authorities.
	   The News, a national Pakistani newspaper, quoted unnamed
government sources Monday as saying Howaida claimed the attack was
sponsored by Osama bin Laden, a Saudi harbored in neighboring
Afghanistan who U.S. officials have identified as a possible
suspect in the bombings.
	   Bin Laden has been vocal in his hatred of what he sees as U.S.
imperialism and pledged to drive U.S. troops out of bases in places
like his native Saudi Arabia.
	   The News said Howaida was a 34-year-old Palestinian engineer who
confessed to helping plan the bombings. He reportedly told
investigators six other conspirators slipped through the Karachi
airport Aug. 7 and apparently made it to Afghanistan, where they
had been told they would be congratulated by bin Laden.
	   A government source had told The Associated Press on condition
of anonymity that U.S. investigators who came to Karachi were
denied access to the suspect.
	   Pakistan's decision to hand Howaida over to Kenyan rather than
American officials may have been prompted by the case involving
Kasi, the Pakistani convicted of killing two CIA employees during a
shooting spree in Virginia in 1993.
	   When Kasi was arrested in Pakistan in June 1997 in a joint
FBI-Pakistani operation, angry Pakistanis accused their government
of groveling before U.S. power.

Cambodian utilities prices to skyrocket next month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Utilities prices in Phnom Penh are
expected to skyrocket next month, led by a 60 percent increase in
electricity rates, officials said Monday.
	   The new power rates will force other utilities companies to
dramatically raise their prices, said Mann Chhoeun, a city
official.
	   The Cambodia Daily newspaper reported that water charges could
be pushed 40 percent higher.
	   The price hikes, which were put off until after last month's
parliamentary elections for political reasons, have been blamed on
the drop in the value of Cambodia's currency and the rising price
of diesel oil.
	   Word of the price increases has incensed Phnom Penh residents
who say they cannot afford the higher rates. Many complain that
they are already often overcharged by corrupt officials.
	   ``No one can survive the new costs,'' said Meas Bun, 63, an
employee at National Museum. ``My salary is only 35,000 riel (dlrs
10) a month. I will have to cut my use of electricity.''
	   As of Sept. 1, the power company Electricite du Cambodge will
increase the charge per kilowatt hour from 350 riel (10.2 cents) to
the riel equivalent of 16.5 cents for residences and for industrial
enterprises that use more than 250 kilowatt amps per hour, company
officials said.
	   Embassies, hotels, private banks, entertainment clubs,
commercial buildings, rental housing and foreigners will be charged
the equivalent of 19 cents per kilowatt hour, a 9.5 percent
decrease from the current commercial fee, in effort to get them to
stop using their own generators and start using city power.
	   Public institutions and small enterprises will be charged the
riel equivalent of 17.5 cents.
	   ``The raise is unavoidable,'' said Tan Kim Vin, a power company
official, who explained that the company has been losing more than
dlrs 1 million a month since Jan. 1. ``In a market economy, if you
don't pay attention to financial sufficiency, you go bankrupt, you
die.''

Dengue fever outbreak affects 3,030 in one province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ An outbreak of dengue fever, fostered by
an ongoing drought, has left four people dead in the central
province of Quang Binh, the Labor newspaper reported Monday.
	   It said 3,030 people, including more than 900 children, had
contracted the mosquito-borne virus as of Aug. 11, and there were
no signs the outbreak is being brought under control.
	   Vietnam has been hit hard by dengue this year, with a number of
deaths in the Mekong Delta from a particularly bad strain of the
disease.
	   The drought in central Vietnam, the second this year, has
created ideal conditions for a dengue epidemic by turning many
rivers into strings of stagnating ponds where mosquitoes breed.
	   Neighboring Quang Tri province has reported 10,200 cases so far,
although no deaths have been attributed to dengue.
	   Dengue infects an estimated 50 million people each year in a
geographic band around the equator. It causes fever, joint pains,
chills and, in serious cases, hemorrhaging.
	   Patients can take several weeks to recover and there is no
vaccine.

Ten militants killed in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ An encounter between army soldiers and
separatist guerrillas in Kashmir on Monday left 10 militants dead,
an official said.
	   The operation took place shortly after midnight in the dense
forests of Kalaroos village in Kupwara district, 140 kilometers (85
miles) north of summer capital Srinagar, said an army spokesman who
cannot be identified.
	   Army soldiers raided the forest following a tip and cordoned the
area. Militants fired at the soldiers with automatic rifles and the
soldiers fired back, he said.
	   There were no casualties among soldiers.
	   In the last 15 days, some 30 militants have been killed in
encounters in Kupwara district following an increase in patrolling
by the soldiers.
	   Army and paramilitary soldiers have been fighting Muslim
guerrillas who demand an independent Kashmir. The insurrection,
which broke out in 1989, has left more than 16,000 people dead so
far.

Hong Kong marks victory over Japanese in Sino-Japanese war

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa on Monday marked
the 53th anniversary of Hong Kong's liberation from Japanese troops
in the Sino-Japanese war with scores of veterans who fought under
the Chinese Communist banner.
	   About 1,000 people, including scores of elderly veterans, some
sporting mainland military medals, attended the solemn ceremony in
sweltering heat at a war memorial in the rural New Territories
bordering China. They sang war songs, and several veterans
exchanged stories of their experiences.
	   It was the first time the post-handover government gave official
recognition to the 1,000-strong local Independent Battalion, which
fought for Hong Kong's liberation during the war, said the
organizer, Lo, a Hong Kong delegate to China's legislature.
	   Lo said the colonial government refused to acknowledge the
troops' contribution for decades for political reasons, and that
this was the first time survivors staged a high-profile event in
Hong Kong to mark the anniversary.
	   Last year, Tung drew criticism for failing to organize any
official activities to mark Hong Kong's liberation. The government
announced earlier an official ceremony would be held during the
Chung Yeung Festival in autumn, when Chinese traditionally
commemorate their ancestors.
	   Hong Kong was returned to Chinese rule in July 1997, ending more
than 150 years of British rule.
	   ``These people should be remembered,'' for their contribution,
Lo said.
	   One veteran, Tsui Yung-tak, 72, said he patrolled the outlying
Lantau island for Japanese soldiers and local thugs nightly. He
said he feared he would be killed when Japanese troops captured him

	   Meanwhile in downtown, a group of activists that China regards
as subversives also organized their own commemoration.
	   About 40 people later marched to the Japanese consulate calling

Japanese occupation between 1941-45.
	   The Communist army organized a 1,000-strong battalion after the
British surrendered the territory. Lo said about 400 veterans
survive, with half of them living in Hong Kong.

attended another ceremony with former local and British servicemen.

Stolen French painting recovered
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ A French painting stolen and
damaged in a daylight raid at Auckland Art Gallery earlier this
month was recovered by police in New Zealand on Monday.
	   The 1874 oil painting ``Still on Top,'' by French-born artist
Jacques-Joseph (James) Tissot, was valued at up to U.S. dlrs 1
million before it was taken by a gun-wielding thief on Aug. 9.
	   Police recovered the work after armed officers searched a
cottage in the township of Waikaretu.
	   The painting was located under a bed but small pieces of the
canvas were missing and there were several rips. The work was still
attached to its frame at the bottom but had been cut away at the
other three sides.
	   Gallery director Chris Saines admitted he was ``shattered'' when
he saw the damage but was confident it could eventually return to
public display.
	   ``It's been a tumultuous day,'' Saines said. ``There was the
excitement of hearing about the recovery and then the devastation
of seeing the painting in the condition it is.''
	   Saines said there was no doubt the value of the painting had
fallen as a result of the damage and he said restoration would take
about a year.
	   ``It's quite remarkable what contemporary conservation can do,''
Saines said.
	   The likely course of restoration included relining the work,
putting it down on to a new canvas backing and infilling the bare
patches if the missing pieces could not be found.
	   He said one piece of luck was that much of the major damage was
away from the areas of intricate detail.
	   A 48-year-old unemployed man appeared in Pukekohe District Court
Monday charged with three counts of aggravated robbery including
the one at Auckland Art Gallery. He was remanded in custody.

Culminating months of financial turmoil, Russia devalues ruble

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After weeks of financial turmoil, Russia sharply
devalued the shaky national currency on Monday in a move expected
to cause hardship for Russian consumers and rattle international
markets.
	   The Central Bank said it would permit the value of the ruble to
fall about 50 percent _ from about 6.3 to the dollar to 9.5 to the
dollar.
	   President Boris Yeltsin interrupted his vacation and headed to
the Kremlin for a crisis meeting with his prime minister, Sergei
Kiriyenko.
	   The government ``needed to take effective steps in the current
situation, and we have done that,'' Kiriyenko said before meeting
Yeltsin.
	   A ruble devaluation had been widely rumored, in part because the
government faces heavy payments on ruble-denominated debt in coming
days and weeks.
	   ``The government's action is an effective and timely response to
the very grave financial situation which threatened the nation's
political and economic stability,'' said Anatoly Chubais, Russia's
liaison with international lenders who is widely respected in the
West.
	   ``The Russian leadership has taken these steps only after
exhausting other options,'' Chubais said, blaming the country's
financial straits on the Asian crisis and a recent drop in world
oil prices.
	   The government also forced a restructuring of short-term debts,
saying it would halt payment on government treasury bills and
impose a 90-day moratorium on payments of ruble-denominated foreign
debt.
	   Chubais insisted that the government was not defaulting.
	   ``We are not reneging on our debts,'' he said. ``We realize that
many of our partners will feel uncomfortable, but any hesitation on
our part would cost them far more.''
	   ``I hope the government's steps will be understood both in
Russia and abroad,'' he said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The devaluation is a tricky political move for the government.
It will sharply raise the prices of imports sold in Russia, which
account for a large percentage of Russian consumer goods, including
more than half the food sold in stores.
	   However, it was also expected to ease the government's budget
crunch, making it possible to pay months of wages and pensions owed
to hard-pressed Russians.
	   Government officials put the best spin on the situation. Central
Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin said the government action was ``aimed
at protecting Russian citizens and domestic producers.''
	   ``The government has decided to act in favor of them and against
traders in the hard currency and bond markets,'' he said according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The money tied up in stock speculation ``will now be directed to
the real sector of the economy and serve the interests of all
Russians,'' Dubinin said.
	   Russia's ruble is traded openly on international exchanges. In
recent years, the government has set a band for daily fluctuations
and buys and sells its reserves to keep it within that corridor.
	   Monday's action moves the lower end of that corridor from about
6.3 to 9.5 to the dollar and sets the upper limit at 6 to the
dollar. The actual rate will be set by the market, but the Central
Bank pledged to continue intervening to prevent a sharp plunge.
	   The price of the ruble dropped only slightly when the currency
market opened, slipping from 6.31 to 6.43 in early trading. The
stock market delayed its opening.
	   The devaluation was expected to lead to the collapse of many
Russian commercial banks, who are over-dependent on now devalued
ruble assets. The government and Central Bank said they would pool
the resources of leading banks to limit the damage.
	   They also proposed legislation to strengthen controls over
Russian financial markets in an effort to halt further capital
flight.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, who has been critical of the
government's economic policies, announced that the parliament is
likely to agree to hold an emergency session next week.
	   Yeltsin has called on the opposition-dominated parliament to
convene in a special session to endorse austerity measures demanded
by the International Monetary Fund and other lenders. In the
absence of parliamentary approval, Yeltsin has imposed many of the
measures by decree.

Vatican forging Internet connections with far-flung bishops
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL J. WAKIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ From Washington to Warsaw, the pope's
brother bishops and his diplomatic soldiers will soon grow closer
with a new computer network.
	   Working out of the Internet Office behind the Vatican's walls,
church experts are building a network that will let bishops enter a
password and download instructions and documents direct from Rome.
	   Meanwhile, Vatican nunciatures, or embassies, will be provided
direct access to the Vatican's computers. Instead of using a local
Internet server to log on via the Vatican's Web site, diplomats
will tie into Vatican computers through private phone-line
connections.
	   Envoys and the office of the Vatican's secretary of state will
be able to exchange diplomatic instructions and field reports _
whether about persecution of Roman Catholics or the state of
church-run hospitals _ instantly and securely via e-mail.
	   The direct hookup will be a major boon, particularly in
countries where Internet connections must be made through
state-controlled servers, said Sister Judith Zoebelein, technical
director of the Internet Office.
	   When it comes to governments that may be hostile to the church,
``the last thing we want is our e-mail sitting there,'' she said.
	   Diplomatic messages will be encrypted for added security, she
added.
	   The two projects, expected to be in place by the end of the
year, fit in with major strides in technology under Pope John Paul
II, who has shown himself adept at spreading his message with the
tools of the digital age.
	   He has set up a Vatican broadcasting office, recorded the rosary
on compact disc and is moving forward with an authoritative Vatican
Internet site for laymen.
	   The Web site started simply, giving the text of John Paul's 1995
Christmas message and providing a destination for e-mails.
	   Three-and-a-half years later, the site's developers have plans
to create what looks uncannily like a virtual papacy.
	   Programmers are working on having the site provide live audio
feeds of the pope's words, starting with his Sunday blessing; video
clips of papal activities; and an electronic archive of every papal
document this century.
	   ``We are thinking of a thousand things,'' said Bishop Claudio
Maria Celli, who runs the Vatican administration and oversees the
Internet Office.
	   By 2000, Celli predicts, all the teachings of this century's
nine popes will be available on the Internet. That includes the 20
thick volumes of John Paul II, who is one of the most prolific
popes in recent times.
	   Celli acknowledges there is a danger of a loss of authenticity
for some Catholics who experience their faith through cyber means.
	   ``The road to God needs participation in a community. The
Internet offers elements, but it doesn't substitute this road,'' he
said.
	   Security is another major concern. The Vatican invested heavily
in protective measures in setting up its Internet computers.
	   Hackers try to break in to the Vatican's computers six or seven
times a day, Zoebelein said.
	   ``All you have to do is get in and change a document, and you
can change profoundly (church) teachings,'' she said.
	   Citing security concerns, she would not discuss the names given
the computers in the 11-computer cluster, which was donated by
Digital.
	   The Vatican previously has revealed that three of them are named
after the archangels Gabriel, Raphael and Michael _ God's
messengers to man, according to Catholic tradition.

Chinese protest attacks against Indonesian Chinese
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Available

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ More than 100 students tried to protest Monday
outside Indonesia's embassy to protest attacks against ethnic
Chinese, but police who had banned the demonstration let just four
through to present a petition.
	   The Beijing students were protesting brutal attacks against
ethnic Chinese in Indonesia during riots in May that helped bring
down President Suharto.
	   Chinese women angered by rapes committed during the riots and
what they said was their own government's fainthearted response
also appealed Monday to the United Nations to investigate.
	   The students who gathered outside the embassy and demanded to
see the ambassador did so even though police last week refused to
grant permission for a demonstration, citing public order concerns.
	   Police kept the students back from a fenced-off compound housing
the embassy building. After prolonged discussion with a group of
students, the police allowed four male students wearing shorts and
T-shirts to go into the compound to meet an embassy spokesman and
submit a petition.
	   The students, who marched in arm-in-arm, gave the spokesman
documents and a T-shirt marked with the slogan ``Protest the
violence, punish the murderers.'' It was covered with student
signatures on one side and a handwritten letter to the Indonesian
government on the other.
	   Uniformed police kept the other protesters across the street.
That group of about 100 cheered when the four walked out of the
compound.
	   Workers at a construction site and some passers-by paused to
watch the gathering, something not seen on Beijing streets for
years.
	   Chinese authorities are wary of any civic protests, fearful that
they could escalate into larger demonstrations against the
government. Officials are doubly anxious to keep a lid on any
protests at Beijing university campuses because they initiated
massive pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989.
	   A women's group of writers and journalists also asked last week
for police permission to demonstrate outside the embassy on Monday,
which marked Indonesian national day, but were turned down.
	   Instead, about 40 women attended a meeting Monday in a Beijing
hotel, listening to speakers who tearfully condemning the rapes of
ethnic Chinese women and young girls. They accused their own
government of reacting late and weakly to the atrocities.
	   The women released a letter that they planned to forward to U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan, as well as a protest note to
Indonesia's ambassador in Beijing.
	   The students said they wanted to know what action Indonesia's
government planned to take to prevent ethnic Chinese from being
attacked again. They also called for an end to laws that allow
discrimination against ethnic Chinese and an accounting of the
government's actions in the May unrest.
	   The students also unfurled a banner in English that read ``All
these things to be answered for.'' But police made them take it
down within seconds. Police also prevented reporters from speaking
with the students.

Asian markets fall on concerns over U.S. stocks and regional
</HEADLINE>
currencies

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets fell Monday on concerns
over the slump on Wall Street and shaky regional currencies, with
the key index in Tokyo tumbing more than 2 percent.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 329.27
points, or 2.18 percent, to close at 14,794.66 _ its lowest since
June 17, and below the pschologically significant 15,000-point
level. On Friday, the Nikkei index sank 258.09 points, or 1.68
percent
	   Traders blamed the drop in part to a worsening of sentiment
following a decline in U.S. stocks traded on Wall Street Friday.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 34.50 points, or
0.4 percent, to 8,425.00, its lowest close since late February and
9.8 percent below its peak of 9,337.97 on July 17.
	   Concerns about a new round of sell-offs in Southeast Asian
currency and stock markets also sent investors scurrying for the
safe haven of the greenback.
	   The U.S. dollar was quoted at 146.47 yen as of mid-afternoon, up
1.59 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and above its late New York rate
of 146.35 yen.
	   Malaysian shares were also trading lower at midday because of
the concerns over Asian currencies.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 4.12
points, or 1.3 percent, to 323.86.
	   In Taipei, share prices closed lower as investors were worried
about Taiwan's slowing economy. On Friday, the Taiwanese government
cut its 1998 economic growth forecast to 5.3 percent _ the lowest
since 1985 _ from 6.02 percent.
	   The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 97.99
points, or 1.3 percent, to 7,273.85.
	   New Zealand share prices closed lower, with brokers saying the
local market mirrored a fall on the U.S market Friday and investor
caution relating to domestic political uncertainty. The NZSE-40
Capital Index fell 3.60 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,937.97.
	   Philippine shares losed lower on late profit-taking. The
30-share Philippine Stock Exchange index fell 2.21 points, or 0.1
percent, to 1,335.71.
	   Australian share prices also slumped during a gloomy trading
day. The All Ordinaries Index fell 32.2 points, or 1.3 percent, to
2,536.8.
	   In Seoul, share prices closed lower on continued concern over
the unstable Japanese currency. The Korea Composite Stock Price
Index fell 2.99 points, or 0.9 percent, to 301.62.
	   Singapore shares opened mostly lower, dragged down by Friday's
fall on Wall Street.
	   The markets were closed in Hong Kong and Indonesia for holidays.

Japanese stocks fall, dollar higher in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with closing bond, late afternoon currency

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks plunged to a two-month low, following
declines on Wall Street and doubts about the new prime minister's
ability to resuscitate Japan's economy. The U.S. dollar rose
against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 329.27
points, or 2.18 percent, to close at 14,794.66 _ its lowest since
June 17. On Friday, the Nikkei index sank 258.09 points, or 1.68
percent.
	   That brought the Nikkei close to a 12-year low of 14,309.41, set
in August 1992.
	   Analysts said the sharp fall could signal the start of another
miserable week for Tokyo stock prices, with financial instability
overseas compounding the dour outlook for domestic growth.
	   Worse, the pessimism in Tokyo, the world's second-largest
bourse, could spill back over into other major markets, driving
down share prices there even further, said analysts.
	   ``The external situation _ Russia and falls in the U.S. stock
market _ have made investors here very jittery,'' said Patrick
Mohr, a strategist at Merrill Lynch Japan.
	   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.4
percent to 8,425.00, its lowest close since late February and
almost a tenth below its peak of 9,337.97 on July 17.
	   Investors are worried about the fate of a set of bills put
forward by incoming Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to stabilize
Japan's shaky financial system, said Eiji Tomaru, a manager in the
strategy section at Kankaku Securities Co.
	   Opposition lawmakers have criticized Obuchi's banking
legislation as a taxpayer-funded bailout which doesn't punish inept
executives.
	   Concerns the opposition could force the government to take
harsher measures, such as letting competition close down weaker
institutions, helped drive down the benchmark Nikkei average, said
Kevin Hebner, Japan equity strategist at Warburg Dillon Read.
	   While weeding out the weaker banks may be good in the long run,
the prospect drove down share prices of banks, the Tokyo market's
biggest component.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section tumbled 16.77 points, or 1.43 percent, to 1,152.03.
The TOPIX fell 12.91 points, or 1.09 percent on Friday.
	   An estimated 398 million shares changed hands on the first
section, below 433 million Friday. Declining issues overwhelmed
gainers almost 9-to-1.
	   On the currency exchange, the U.S. dollar rose on concerns about
a new round of financial turmoil in Russia and Asia.
	   The dollar bought 146.45 yen at late afternoon, up 1.57 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and above its late New York rate of 146.35
yen.
	   Persistent doubts about Russia's currency and economy led to a
surge in the dollar against the yen and other currencies in New
York on Friday, traders said.
	   Concerns about a new round of sell-offs in Southeast Asian
currency and stock markets also sent investors scurrying for the
safe haven of the greenback.
	   The dollar traded as low as 145.90 yen and as high as 146.90
yen.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.150 percent from Friday's finish of 1.175
yen, pushing its price up to 112.11 yen from 111.94 yen.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Lawyers for P. W. Botha argued
during closing arguments Monday that a contempt charge against the
hard line apartheid-era president should be dismissed.
	   Attorney Lappe Laubscher said the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission made technical errors in calling Botha to appear.
	   Botha, 82, ignored the summons, claiming that the panel probing
atrocities committed under white rule wanted to humiliate him by
forcing a public appearance after he had supplied more than 1,700
pages of written answers.
	   A motorcade brought Botha to court, and whisked him through a
back entrance after a security scare. Police said a ``suspicious
package'' in the lobby was later found to be harmless.
	   Wearing a dark blue suit, Botha smiled and joked with supporters
and family when he entered the courtroom.
	   Forcing Botha to appear became a key test of the commission's
credibility, especially with many black people who accuse it of
being too soft on top members of apartheid governments.
	   Commission lawyers wanted to question Botha on the role of the
State Security Council, a shadowy security body he headed during
the 1980s when a violent crackdown on anti-apartheid groups reached
its peak.
	   During his trial Botha's defense team has been confronted with
documents and witnesses who allege the council authorized the
killing of black liberation fighters.
	   With a verdict set to be delivered in about a week, the trial is
now nearly at an end.
	   Botha's spokesman, Paul Lombard, said Botha was looking forward
to the end of a tiring case. ``It doesn't matter who you are, or
how old you are. Something like this will take it out of you,'' he
said.
	   If convicted Botha faces up to two years in jail or an
unspecified fine. Given his age and frail health a fine is
considered more likely.
	   As usual security was tight, with rolls of razor wire and armed
police ringing the court in George, a small coastal town about 240
miles (390 kilometers) east of Cape Town.

Police raid on strike-bound Hyundai Motor Co. appears imminent

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The government appealed for a
negotiated settlement of a labor dispute at Hyundai Motor Co.
Monday amid signs of an imminent police intervention.
	   ``We don't have time to stumble any longer,'' Labor Minister Lee
Ki-ho told reporters before leaving Seoul to visit striking Hyundai
workers in Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of Seoul.
	   He said police would break up the strike if the dispute is not
resolved soon. News reports said the number of riot police in Ulsan
was being increased from 4,500 to 13,000
	   The national news agency, Yonhap, said a raid could come in a
day or two.
	   The nation's largest auto firm has been idle since July 20 when
its 26,000-member union went on strike to protest spreading
layoffs. About 2,000 workers and their family members have since
been picketing the company's main plants.
	   Chief presidential spokesman Park Ji-won said earlier Monday
that the government's patience in dealing with the problem is
limited.
	   ``The government wants both sides to come up with a compromise,
but law should be upheld under any circumstances,'' he told
reporters.
	   His reference to the law apparently reflected the government's
position that the Hyundai strike is illegal because it was called
without a request for mandatory government mediation.
	   Past police raids on Hyundai and other major strike-bound plants
resulted in violent clashes with workers. Hyundai's union is known
for its militancy.
	   Hyundai's unionized employees want the company to take back
1,600 workers it fired July 31 because of sharply falling domestic
sales.
	   Hyundai, which earlier got rid of 6,100 workers by offering them
enhanced early retirement packages, insists it has to reduce its
work force in line with slumping demand for its cars.
	   The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, a major umbrella labor
group, threw its strength behind striking Hyundai workers Monday by
declaring that other members under its control will go on strike if
police launch a raid on Hyundai plants.
	   The confederation, which claims a membership of 500,000 in car,
steel, shipbuilding and other key industries, also said it will
pull out of talks with the government and management on labor
problems.
	   As of Monday, Hyundai said the strike had cost it dlrs 535
million in lost production. Nearly 75 percent of that amount would
have come from exports, it said.
	   Hyundai Motor, a subsidiary of Hyundai group, South Korea's
second largest conglomerate, has been operating at 40 percent of
its annual capacity of 1.25 million cars.

Officials predict clear weather for Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Athletes and visitors to the
Commonwealth Games that open in September are likely to enjoy
clear, haze-free air, because no forest fires have been reported
this month, the meteorological department said Monday, according
the national news agency Bernama.
	   Many nations participating in the 10-day games that begin on
Sept. 11 have voiced concerns that air pollution from brush fires
may affect the health of athletes.
	   September 1997 was one of the worst months for haze in Malaysia.
Smoke billowing from blazing forests in Indonesia blanketed the
region, closing down airports and schools and causing thousands of
people to seek treatment for respiratory disorders.
	   More than 6,000 athletes and officials from 70 nations are
expected take part in the games billed as the second largest sports
event after the Olympics.

Children, pregnant women lack iron in diet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Researchers are trying to figure out the
best way to add iron to fish sauce to overcome a deficiency that
affects a large part of Vietnam's population, the director of the
National Institute of Nutrition said Monday.
	   Professor Ha Huy Khoi said a 1995 survey showed that more than
50 percent of Vietnamese women of reproductive ages and children
suffer from iron deficiency, mainly due to poor diet.
	   The mostly seriously affected groups are pregnant women and
children under age 2, he said.
	   Local and foreign economists have estimated that iron
deficiencies result in the loss of some dlrs 200 million a year due
to the low productivity of affected workers.
	   Fish sauce was chosen as the possible solution because it is
used virtually every day. The problem is how to add iron without
affecting taste.

Death toll in Ukrainian mine blast reaches 24
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Rescue workers in eastern Ukraine have
recovered 20 bodies of coal miners who were killed in a methane
blast and were working to retrieve four more, a news report said
Monday.
	   The bodies of four miners believed killed in the blast on Sunday
remain in remote zones of the 19th Communist Party Congress mine in
the Luhansk region, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   A total of 28 miners were working in the section of the mine
where the explosion occurred. Four survived and are currently
hospitalized with burns.
	   Another 95 miners were underground elsewhere in the mine at the
time of the blast but were evacuated.
	   Five rescue workers who were injured recovering bodies of the
dead miners Sunday were also taken to hospital, officials at the
Luhansk regional department for work safety said.
	   A government commission is working to determine the cause of the
blast, which struck 675 meters (2,228 feet) underground early
Sunday.
	   Two similar accidents occurred at the 19th Communist Party
Congress mine in 1953 and 1957, in which 33 and 22 miners were
killed, respectively.
	   About 200 miners have already died this year in Ukraine's
deteriorating coal mines, many more than in the same period last
year.
	   The number of miners killed on the job has been steadily
increasing in recent years because mines lack the funds needed to
modernize equipment and improve safety conditions.
	   The worst single accident this year occurred in April, when a
methane blast killed 63 workers at a mine in the eastern region of
Donetsk.

NATO flexes military muscle to help contain Kosovo crisis

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ As a dozen jetfighters soared overhead,
about 1,700 troops from the United States and other countries began
a five-day military exercise Monday to show the Alliance's
readiness to contain the crisis in neighboring Kosovo province.
	   Security was heightened because of concern over Islamic
extremists following explosions at U.S. Embassies in Africa and the
arrest of several Egyptians here, reportedly in connection with
religious violence in Egypt.
	   Albanian troops cordoned off the air base adjacent to Rinas
International Airport where the opening ceremony was held. American
and German troops also manned checkpoints.
	   Troops from 14 nations will conduct training for parachute
supply drops, vehicle and foot patrols, marksmanship and other
non-offensive drills in the Albanian mountains. Ten other nations
have sent observers.
	   Navy Capt. Steve Burnette, spokesman for the exercise, said the
operation, ``Cooperative Assembly 1998,'' was to ``provide
stability and help contain a regional crisis.''
	   The Americans and Europeans fear the fighting in Serbia's Kosovo
province, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence,
could spill over into neighboring countries with large Albanian
communities.
	   Hundreds have died in fighting in Kosovo since Serb police
cracked down on the separatist KLA in February.
	   ``We want to have an impact that NATO is just around the
corner,'' U.S. Adm. Joe Lopez, NATO commander of Allied
Forces-South, told reporters. ``Belgrade and any belligerents in
the region will get the same message _ that NATO is ready. NATO has
a wide range of contingencies and options ranging from peace
support to combat operations.''
	   Albania's defense minister, Luan Hajdaraga, said the the NATO
show of force ``is important to discourage'' any move by the
Serb-led Yugoslav government to drive ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
	   Although the Albanian government supports a peaceful solution to
the crisis, rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army maintain bases in
the north of the country, from where they smuggle arms and
ammunition into Serbia.
	   The Albanians here are struggling restore the structures of
government, including effective internal security, after last
year's nationwide riots which exploded following the collapse of
pyramid investment schemes which bankrupted much of the population.
	   As military bands played the national anthems of participating
countries, a dozen jets from six nations flew overhead in a display
of military power. In addition to the military portion of Rinas
airport, exercises will take place in three other locations: a
training area Bize, the village of Kunje and the capital Tirana.
	   Despite NATO's commitment to stability here, the exercise began
as American diplomats were and their families were leaving Albania
as a precaution following the attacks on the U.S. Embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 257 people.
	   Washington has also warned Americans against traveling to
Albania and offered to assist any of its 890 citizens registered
with the embassy to leave the country.
	   Recent reports that Albanian and U.S. authorities cooperated in
arresting at least five Egyptians in Albania who were suspected of
international terrorist links has heightened fears over the safety
of American citizens.
	   Burnette said security was normally strict for NATO exercises
but acknowledged that controls had been tightened ``because of some
threats by Islamic groups.'' He declined to elaborate.
	   The largest contingent in the exercise comes from Italy which
sent about 500 troops. The Italians increased their participation
after the Americans scaled down their numbers because some warships
were diverted to Africa to provide security for Americans in the
Congo, where rebels are seeking to oust President Laurent Kabila.
	   Other large-scale participants, including the Americans,
Germans, French, Turks and Canadians, have sent about 200 troops
each.

	   VISTA HERMOSA, Colombia (AP) _ Nervous police still guard rubble
left from an assault by leftist guerrillas who flattened their
barracks with everything from mortar fire to a homemade tank built
from a tractor and a steel garage door.
	   Combat raged all night and an officer was killed repelling the
April rebel attempt to take this forlorn town that has suddenly
moved center stage as Colombia's new president tries to end a
34-year civil war.
	   Now all that bravery may have been in vain.
	   President Andres Pastrana, who took office this month, is
offering the country's most powerful guerrilla army the opportunity
to walk back into Vista Hermosa, about 110 miles (175 kilometers)
south of the capital, Bogota, without firing a shot.
	   The prospect is worrying residents in this and four other
southern municipalities. Pastrana plans to demilitarize by November
to create a secure venue where peace talks can be held with the
15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
	   ``There are people who want to leave town because they're
afraid,'' said town secretary Jaidy Pedreros. ``But if we're to
have peace someday we're going to have to make a sacrifice.''
	   Pastrana last week reaffirmed his decision to pull government
forces from the towns, which together comprise a 16,200-square-mile
(41,960 square-kilometer) swath of high-rent savannah _ twice the
size of El Salvador _ where farmers graze cattle, plant rice,
plantains and tropical fruits, and grow coca, the raw material for
cocaine.
	   Military leaders have warned against the move, saying the FARC
will take advantage to strengthen its stranglehold on southeastern
Colombia while expanding the cocaine trade that yields ``war
taxes'' for the rebels, their largest income source.
	   Those concerns multiplied after a rebel offensive on the eve of
Pastrana's Aug. 7 inauguration left a major anti-narcotics base in
ruins. As many as 143 police and soldiers were killed and 129
captured.
	   Pastrana has insisted that drug trafficking will not increase
with the demilitarization. The five towns ``will be converted into
a laboratory for peace,'' he said. Many observers feel, however,
that the wealthy and effective rebels have little incentive to lay
down their arms.
	   The guerrilla's recent show of strength was a reminder of the
tenuous grip government forces hold in a region dominated by rebels
for decades and impoverished by central government neglect.
	   Like the Vista Hermosa base, the government's police and army
posts in the four other municipalities are vulnerable, isolated
outposts.
	   In a drizzle one recent morning, police and soldiers patrolled
this town's streets. Without venturing too deeply into the
rebel-infested countryside, the men provided relative peace of mind
for about 4,000 urban residents.
	   Guerrilla threats against candidates forced the cancellation of
elections last October, but about 2,000 residents braved rebel
bullets to vote in the first round of presidential elections on May
31.
	   ``Those people can't be expecting anything good if the
guerrillas take over,'' said Gen. Freddy Padilla, commander of the
army's 7th brigade in Villavicencio, about three hours north.
	   The troop presence may also be a deterrent to right-wing
paramilitary groups, who moved into the region exactly one year
ago, carrying out brutal massacres of civilians they suspect of
rebel sympathies. Some residents fear Vista Hermosa's history as a
rebel stronghold would make it a prime target for the militias.
	   Town officials are trying to calm those fears. They say the
threat of violence will be lessened if the Red Cross and other
civilian agencies are allowed to move in as the troops pull out.
	   But grocery owner Dalia Castano, one of the few residents
willing to give her name to reporters, says the prospect of an army
exit has already dried up investment, depressed business and sent
property values plummeting.
	   Saying she and every other merchant in Vista Hermosa must pay
off the rebels for the ``right'' to be in business, Castano
believes the army's removal will upset a stalemate between the
guerrillas and the government that had at least made a difficult
life predictable.
	   ``The people in the capital think we're living in a war, but we
actually have a kind of peace,'' she says.

	   El PINALITO, Colombia (AP)_ Revolutionary slogans spray-painted
on a bridge are the only outward signs of rebel control in this
village in Colombia's war-wracked south. But it doesn't take a
genius to find the guerrillas.
	   Just ask the kid in the Che Guevara T-shirt and wait while he
disappears in search of ``El Comandante'' _ the local chief of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the country's
largest rebel group.
	   At the village dock, coca seedlings are passed from canoes to
pickup trucks, which speed the raw ingredient for cocaine off to
the illegal plantations dotting the surrounding plains. Local
merchants praise strict ``laws'' imposed by the rebels _ who tax
the coca trade, impose curfews, fine bar brawlers and banish or
even kill violent criminals.
	   Patience pays off when a mudsplattered jeep pulls up beside a
cantina. Out jumps the rebel chief, who jams his 9mm pistol into
the back of his jeans and takes a seat at a streetside table.
	   Five feet (1.52 meters) tall with a wiry frame and a peasant's
sun-baked face, Comandante Alberto is eager to talk. But he's in no
mood to give up a struggle the rebels have waged since the 1960s.
	   Despite the FARC's pledge to begin peace talks by November with
President Andres Pastrana, the rebels in El Pinalito are grinning
about their recent military victories and more confident than ever
of victory.
	   ``We've made gestures of dialogue with every government,'' says
Alberto, who heads one of the 15,000-member insurgent group's
estimated 63 fighting fronts. ``But the FARC will never give up its
arms. This never even crosses our minds.''
	   A withering rebel offensive before Pastrana's Aug. 7
inauguration inflicted heavy army losses and raised doubts about
whether Pastrana can do much more than accept guerrilla control
over nearly half the national territory.
	   ``They can have their base over there and we'll keep our camp
here,'' said Alberto, gesturing up a dirt road to where an army
company sits a 45-minute drive away.
	   He insists the rebels are still fighting to end poverty and
foreign exploitation. And he scoffs at critics who say the
guerrillas have become little more than a criminal enterprise
feeding off the drug trade.
	   Comandante Alberto also defends his role as judge and
executioner in a village where the rebels are said to carry out
death sentences for unrepentant thieves.
	   ``We want the people to live like one big family, '' he says.

Police arrest two men on suspicion of extorting airline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police confirming alleged racketeers; ADDS total
racketeers

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police on Monday arrested two men on suspicion of
extorting 22.8 million yen (dlrs 155,000) from Japan Airlines Co.,
a spokesman said.
	   The two were alleged ``sokaiya'' racketeer Hitoshi Ogasawara,
51, and Mamoru Arai, 53, the president of a leasing company,
Taihei, said a police spokesman who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The alleged extortion was reportedly in return for promising to
ensure trouble-free shareholders' meetings for the airline, he
said.
	   JAL, Japan's largest airline, is the latest company to be named
in a widening crackdown on racketeering that brought the arrest
last year of executives from top companies such as Nomura
Securities Co., Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and Mitsubishi Motors
Corp.
	   A number of JAL executives have already admitted involvement in
the scheme and their case will soon be forwarded to the Public
Prosecutor's Office, news reports said.
	   Ogasawara allegedly is a senior member of a sokaiya racketeer
group, the police spokesman said.
	   Sokaiya are a unique feature of the corporate Japanese
landscape. Famous for blackmailing executives by threatening to
reveal embarassing corporate secrets at annual shareholders
meetings, many are actually hired by companies to silence hostile
shareholders.
	   Authorities believe Arai's company to be controlled by the
notorious Sumiyoshi-kai underworld syndicate, the Asahi newspaper
said.
	   JAL is suspected of hiding payments to the racketeers under the
pretext of leasing artificial flowers from Arai's company,
according to the Asahi.

NATO flexes military muscle to help contain Kosovo crisis
</HEADLINE>

threats by Islamic groups, new quotes, BACKGROUND; no pickup. &QL;

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ As a dozen jet fighters soared overhead,
about 1,700 troops from the United States and other countries began
a five-day military exercise Monday to show the alliance's
readiness to contain the crisis in neighboring Kosovo province.
	   Security was heightened because of concern over Islamic
extremists following explosions at U.S. embassies in Africa and the
arrest of several Egyptians here, reportedly in connection with
religious violence in Egypt.
	   Albanian troops cordoned off the air base adjacent to Rinas
International Airport where the opening ceremony was held. American
and German troops also manned checkpoints.
	   Troops from 14 nations will conduct training for parachute
supply drops, vehicle and foot patrols, marksmanship and other
non-offensive drills in the Albanian mountains. Ten other nations
have sent observers.
	   Navy Capt. Steve Burnette, spokesman for the exercise, said the
operation, ``Cooperative Assembly 1998,'' was to ``provide
stability and help contain a regional crisis.''
	   The Americans and Europeans fear the fighting in Serbia's Kosovo
province, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence,
could spill over into neighboring countries with large Albanian
communities.
	   Hundreds have died in fighting in Kosovo since Serb police
cracked down on the separatist KLA in February.
	   ``We want to have an impact that NATO is just around the
corner,'' U.S. Adm. Joe Lopez, NATO commander of Allied
Forces-South, told reporters. ``Belgrade and any belligerents in
the region will get the same message _ that NATO is ready. NATO has
a wide range of contingencies and options ranging from peace
support to combat operations.''
	   Albania's defense minister, Luan Hajdaraga, said the the NATO
show of force ``is important to discourage'' any move by the
Serb-led Yugoslav government to drive ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
	   Although the Albanian government supports a peaceful solution to
the crisis, rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army maintain bases in
the north of the country, from where they smuggle arms and
ammunition into Serbia.
	   The Albanians here are struggling to restore government
structures, including effective internal security, after last
year's nationwide riots which exploded following the collapse of
pyramid investment schemes which bankrupted much of the population.
	   As military bands played the national anthems of the
participating countries, a dozen jets from six nations flew
overhead in a display of military power. In addition to the
military portion of Rinas airport, exercises will take place in
three other locations: a training area Bize, the village of Kunje
and the capital Tirana.
	   Despite NATO's commitment to stability here, the exercise began
as American diplomats and their families were leaving Albania as a
precaution following the attacks on the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, which killed 257 people.
	   Washington has also warned Americans against traveling to
Albania and offered to assist any of its 890 citizens registered
with the embassy to leave the country.
	   Recent reports that Albanian and U.S. authorities cooperated in
arresting at least five Egyptians in Albania who were suspected of
international terrorist links has heightened fears over the safety
of American citizens.
	   Burnette said security was normally strict for NATO exercises
but acknowledged that controls had been tightened ``because of some
threats by Islamic groups.'' He declined to elaborate.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Celebrating Indonesia's national day,
flag-bearing officers strutted at the presidential palace Monday
while traditional dancers sashayed for political prisoners in a
jail yard.
	   From five-star hotels to slum shacks, red and white Indonesian
flags and banners festooned the capital, a festive display belying
the economic hardship that millions are suffering.
	   Police and soldiers were posted at intersections following
rumors that riots might break out during the celebrations, but the
streets were quiet.
	   With Indonesia's economic turmoil stripping people of jobs and
driving up prices, fears linger of more deadly unrest like the
riots in May that helped oust former President Suharto.
	   Some ethnic Chinese, whose shops and homes were targeted in the
Jakarta upheaval that killed about 1,200 people, left the country
amid rumors of violence on Monday.
	   Despite the uncertainty, President B.J. Habibie presided over a
show of pomp on the lawn of his palace, saluting phalanxes of
soldiers who paraded to brass band tunes and waving to choirs of
schoolchildren.
	   Foreign ambassadors and government officials were on hand for a
flag-raising ceremony. Indonesia declared independence from Dutch
colonial rule in 1945. The Dutch left four years later after
failing to quell nationalist forces in a war.
	   Suharto, whose hold on power was dislodged by riots over price
increases and student protests, did not attend the ceremony.
	   On Saturday, Habibie made a marathon speech to Parliament in
which he apologized for widespread human rights abuses during
Suharto's 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   In an annual tradition to mark independence, the government cut
the sentences of some prisoners, allowing more than 80 inmates
convicted of crimes such as robbery to walk free.
	   But 100 protesters demonstrated outside Jakarta's Cipinang jail,
urging that the government free all political prisoners. Inside,
the detainees said Habibie should prove his commitment to
democratic reform by releasing all jailed opponents of Suharto. So
far, he has released dozens.
	   ``We've been treated by the Habibie regime as a commodity,''
said pro-democracy activist Budiman Sudjatmiko, whose 13-year
prison term for subversion was cut by one month.
	   Budiman is head of the People's Democratic Party, a political
party that was banned under Suharto but has since been legalized.
	   Xanana Gusmao, the jailed rebel leader of the disputed territory
of East Timor, was granted a four-month reduction in his 20-year
sentence.
	   Performing in the prison, traditional dancers from western Java
island prayed and pressed knives and needles into their bodies
without suffering serious injury.
	   The inmates later played games, climbing up a flagpole to grab
prizes, such as T-shirts or bottles of water.
	   In a snub to Habibie, prominent opposition figure Megawati
Sukarnoputri, who is the eldest daughter of Indonesia's founding
President Sukarno, staged her own independence ceremony in Jakarta.
	   ``It's better for me to be with the people together, feeling all
the difficulties and concerns,'' Megawati told several hundred
supporters, some wearing headbands with slogans that read
``Reform.''
	   Megawati, who urged democratic change when Suharto was in power,
was ousted as leader of the minority Indonesian Democratic Party in
June 1996 by a government-backed party faction.

 &UR; BASKETBALL: Webber's agent denies player had marijuana or paid
fine &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Basketball star Chris Webber
``vehemently denies'' he was caught in possession of marijuana or
paid a fine for the offense.
	   Customs Service officials on Saturday reported that Webber
admitted to owning a bag containing 11 grams of marijuana that was
sniffed out by a customs dog at San Juan's international airport on
Friday.
	   A statement said Webber paid a dlrs 500 administrative fine and
was allowed to continue his journey from Dominican Republic to
Barbados on a tour sponsored by the sporting good company Fila.
	   But Webber's agent, Fallasha Erwin, said Sunday there had been a
mixup about who owned the bag.
	   ``A traveling companion claimed ownership of the luggage and
paid the administrative penalty of dlrs 500. However, for unknown
reasons, officials listed Chris Webber as the owner of the bag, not
the traveling companion,'' Erwin said in a telephone call from his
Detroit office.
	   Erwin said the bag contained high-heeled shoes and other items
belonging to Webber's female companion.
	   ``Mr. Webber vehemently denies he had possession of marijuana.
Chris Webber did not pay an administrative penalty of dlrs 500,''
Erwin said.
	   The Customs Service stuck by its original statement.
	   ``I cannot go into details, but what we released yesterday was
the truth and we will back it up,'' said spokeswoman Awilda
Pereira.
 &UR; GUYANA: President to propose relaxed sentence for marijuana
possession
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyana's government is going to stop
jailing people caught with small quantities of marijuana, President
Janet Jagan says.
	   Jagan said she will introduce a bill that would punish marijuana
users caught with less than five grams with only a fine or
community service.
	   ``We want to give a more common sense approach,'' Jagan said in
an interview on state television Sunday. ``What I am saying is that
small cases are being given heavy fines and I don't think it is
right. In the whole narcotics trade, the hard drugs are the real
drugs that are dangerous to people.''
	   In 1988, Guyana introduced a mandatory five-year jail sentence
for possessing marijuana, in addition to a maximum fine of Guyanese
dlrs 10,000 (dlrs 70).
	   Jagan's party should pass the proposed bill since it holds a
majority in the Parliament.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Demolition explosions bring down 17 buildings
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Simultaneous explosions reduced 17
apartment buildings to piles of concrete and tangled steel, putting
a thunderous end to two of Puerto Rico's largest housing projects.
	   One minute after workers detonated charges at 9:03 a.m. Sunday,
only the elevator shafts of five buildings in the Pan American
Village and Las Orquideas (The Orchids) housing projects remained
standing.
	   ``We have managed to eliminate that eyesore that stood at the
entrance of San Juan,'' said Housing Secretary Ana Carmen Alemany.
The 27-acre (11-hectare) site is to be turned into shopping, office
and apartment complexes in a project dubbed the ``New Gateway to
San Juan.''
	   Hundreds of spectators and officials from the Guinness Book of
Records attended to investigate the government's claim that it was
the world's largest demolition explosion. They did not immediately
comment on whether the explosion won the title.
	   Police evacuated 300 families from buildings near the demolition
site and blocked off two main highways.
	   Officials from Demolition Inc. said they used 1,200 pounds (540
kilograms) of dynamite to bring down 50,000 tons (45,000 metric
tons) of concrete and steel.
 &UR; GUYANA: Booker-Tate says it will manage Guyana Sugar for three more
years
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Booker-Tate Ltd., the British
agricultural firm, says it has won a contract to continue managing
Guyana's sugar industry for another three years.
	   Details were not immediately available, and government
representatives could not be reached for comment Sunday.
	   Booker-Tate has managed the state-owned Guyana Sugar Corp. since
1990 under a restructuring program supervised by the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund.
	   With average annual production levels of 255,000 tons, (230,000
metric tons), Guyana Sugar is the largest producer in the 15-nation
Caribbean Community.
	   The firm said it hopes to double production to 500,000 by
building new factories and putting more land under cultivation to
take advantage of a growing brown sugar market.
	   The demand for brown sugar has grown in part because of
increased sales of U.S. soft drinks to India and China, the company
said in a statement Sunday.
	   Caribbean Community members together produce about 850,000 tons
of sugar annually.
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Congress opens with political split
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ The Dominican
Republic's Congress opened with an immediate dispute over
leadership that split the majority Dominican Revolutionary Party.
	   On Sunday, 10 Revolutionary Party members announced they were
forming an opposition faction in the lower House of Deputies. They
split because the party had chosen Winston Arnaud to preside over
the chamber instead of the incumbent, Rafael Peguero Mendez.
	   The party's share of seats fell from 83 to 73, causing it to
lose its majority in the 149-member house.
	   At the same time, the parties of President Leonel Fernandez and
former President Joaquin Balaguer announced a limited alliance.
	   Together they helped re-elect Peguero to the presidency of the
House of Deputies. Peguero beat Arnaud by three votes.
	   Revolutionary Party lawmakers left in protest. Party followers
burned tires near the Congressional Palace. The demonstrators
accused Fernandez of ``snatching away'' the presidency of the
House.

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Shots were fired during demonstrations
outside the royal palace of this tiny mountain kingdom Monday and
at least two people were injured, South African Broadcasting Corp.
radio said.
	   Crowds have been gathering outside the palace and Parliament for
the past two weeks. Protesters charged that May elections returning
the Lesotho Congress for Democracy were rigged.
	   At least two people have died and four others were injured in
previous clashes between opposition groups and supporters of the
governing party.
	   Security forces have generally been keeping a low profile during
the unrest. Opposition demonstrators have been blocking off roads,
and many shops and offices closed their doors.
	   Lesotho, with a population of 2 million, is surrounded by South
Africa.

Myanmar issues veiled threat of violence against foreign activists
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Myanmar government response to US government in
grafs 7,8, ethnic insurgents supporting Suu Kyi grafs 17,18
 &UR; AP Photo BK101

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's military government issued a
veiled threat of violence Monday against any foreigners intent on
repeating the pro-democracy leafletting campaign carried out by 18
activists last week.
	   ``The Myanmar people want to live in peace and are angry with
the 18 foreigners,'' wrote Maung Pyi Tha, a pen name for a
government official, in a commentary in Monday's state-run New
Light of Myanmar newspaper.
	   ``The next time any destructionists or saboteurs try to disrupt
the country they will face not only the laws but the people who are
ready to prove their sense of duty,'' he wrote.
	   The same author wrote in a commentary on Saturday, that if he
had apprehended the activists he would have physically assaulted
them.
	   The activists _ six Americans, three Thais, three Indonesians,
three Malaysians, two Filipinos and an Australian _ were arrested
the day after the 10th anniversary of a failed nationwide democracy
uprising in Myanmar, also known as Burma, for handing out
pro-democracy leaflets.
	   On Friday, they were sentenced by a Myanmar court to five years
in prison with hard labor. The government deported them on
Saturday.
	   The Myanmar government said Monday it was distressed that the
U.S. government responded to the release by issuing a statement
saying basic human rights are not protected in Myanmar.
	   ``Bearing in mind the American activists avowed aim is to
overthrow the government of Myanmar, we wonder the U.S. government
will deal with such foreign citizens,'' a Myanmar government
spokesman said.
	   Myanmar government officials frequently speak of
``annihilating,'' and ``crushing,'' the democratic opposition led
by 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   On Monday, Suu Kyi entered her sixth day of a stalemate with the
military over her right to meet members of her party outside
Yangon.
	   She and three colleagues were stopped in their van by the
authorities 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside the capital while
traveling to the city of Bassein.
	   The military is refusing to let them proceed, insisting there is
a threat of violence against her in Bassein.
	   The only physical attack on Suu Kyi came in Nov. 1996 by a mob
whose members said they were paid by the government.
	   This is the fourth time in two months Suu Kyi has been stopped
at the same roadblock. The government forcibly ended the last
incident by seizing Suu Kyi's car, forcibly restraining her and
driving her against her will back to Yangon.
	   Suu Kyi's party won 82 percent of the seats in parliament in a
1990 election the military refused to honor.
	   The NLD has set an Aug. 21 deadline for the government to
convene parliament.
	   On Monday, the Karen National Union, an ethnic insurgent group
fighting for autonomy from the military government, issued a
statement supporting the NLD's call for parliament to convene.
	   It called the military government's failure to allow the
congress to meet a ``criminal breach of trust,'' and denounced the
persecution of those elected.
	   Of the 385 NLD members elected in 1990, 181 have either been
imprisoned by the government, forced into exile, died or stripped
of their parliamentary status by the government.
	   The rest are living under harassment from the military, the NLD
has said.

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ As Northern Ireland's leaders
vowed vengeance on the bombers who killed at least 28 men, women
and children, the little town of Omagh struggled to come to grips
with its entry into the province's grim history books.
	   Each of the town's 2,000 residents seemed to have a story to
tell Sunday, offered in flat tones of disbelief: A school chum who
won't be in class next month. A father and son who no longer will
enliven a neighborhood. A shopkeeper who never again will greet
customers with a ready smile.
	   ``I don't understand why I'm living,'' said Jim Sharkey, who was
knocked off his feet at his newsstand on bustling Market Street
when the 500-pound (200-kg) car bomb exploded Saturday in the worst
terrorist strike in Northern Ireland's history.
	   Three generations of one family are gone: Avril Monaghan, 30,
her 18-month-old daughter Maura and her mother Mary Grimes, 65, who
had been visiting from nearby towns to shop on Market Street. Mrs.
Monaghan was pregnant with twins.
	   Fernando Blasco, a 12-year-old boy from Madrid who was visiting
Ireland to learn English, died, as did Rocio Abad, the female
teacher twice his age. The two Spaniards had decided at the last
minute to put off visiting a historical park to do some shopping.

Share prices in German banks drop on ruble devaluation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Share prices in Germany's largest
commercial banks dropped across the board Monday in reaction to the
devaluation of the Russian ruble.
	   Shares of Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest commercial bank, fell
3 percent to 132.65 marks (dlrs 73.70) on word of the devaluation.
Commerzbank shares were down 2.3 percent at 58.77 marks (dlrs
32.65).
	   The decline in bank share prices brought down the German stock
market 2.1 percent to 5358.54 points in early trading.
	   Traders said the Russia's 90-day moratorium on the payment of
all foreign credits also pressured share prices. However, the
reaction was based more on perceptions than any real impact since
more than 90 percent of German bank loans to Russia are covered by
guarantees from the German government.
	   German banks had dlrs 30.4 billion in outstanding credits to
Russia at the end of 1997, according to the Bank for International
Settlements.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After weeks of financial turmoil, Russia sharply
devalued the shaky national currency on Monday in a move expected
to cause hardship for Russian consumers and rattle international
markets.
	   The Central Bank said it would permit the value of the ruble to
fall about 50 percent _ from about 6.3 to the dollar to 9.5 to the
dollar.
	   The currency market dipped only slightly in early trading but
the street price for dollars immediately plunged to 9.5 rubles and
few people appeared willing to exchange rubles at that rate.
	   President Boris Yeltsin interrupted his vacation and headed to
the Kremlin for a crisis meeting with his prime minister, Sergei
Kiriyenko.
	   The government ``needed to take effective steps in the current
situation, and we have done that,'' Kiriyenko said before meeting
Yeltsin.
	   A ruble devaluation had been widely rumored, in part because the
government faces heavy payments on ruble-denominated debt in coming
days and weeks.
	   ``The government's action is an effective and timely response to
the very grave financial situation which threatened the nation's
political and economic stability,'' said Anatoly Chubais, Russia's
liaison with international lenders who is widely respected in the
West.
	   ``The Russian leadership has taken these steps only after
exhausting other options,'' Chubais said, blaming the country's
financial straits on the Asian crisis and a recent drop in world
oil prices.
	   The government also forced a restructuring of short-term debts,
saying it would halt payment on government treasury bills and
impose a 90-day moratorium on payments of ruble-denominated foreign
debt.
	   Chubais insisted that the government was not defaulting.
	   ``We are not reneging on our debts,'' he said. ``We realize that
many of our partners will feel uncomfortable, but any hesitation on
our part would cost them far more.''
	   ``I hope the government's steps will be understood both in
Russia and abroad,'' he said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   The devaluation is a tricky political move for the government.
It will sharply raise the prices of imports sold in Russia, which
account for a large percentage of Russian consumer goods, including
more than half the food sold in stores.
	   However, it was also expected to ease the government's budget
crunch, making it possible to pay months of wages and pensions owed
to hard-pressed Russians.
	   Government officials put the best spin on the situation. Central
Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin said the government action was ``aimed
at protecting Russian citizens and domestic producers.''
	   ``The government has decided to act in favor of them and against
traders in the hard currency and bond markets,'' he said according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The money tied up in stock speculation ``will now be directed to
the real sector of the economy and serve the interests of all
Russians,'' Dubinin said.
	   Russia's ruble is traded openly on international exchanges. In
recent years, the government has set a band for daily fluctuations
and buys and sells its reserves to keep it within that corridor.
Monday's action moves the lower end of that corridor from about 6.3
to 9.5 to the dollar and sets the upper limit at 6 to the dollar.
	   The price of the ruble dropped only slightly when the currency
market opened, slipping from 6.31 to 6.43 in early trading. The
stock market delayed its opening.
	   The devaluation was expected to lead to the collapse of many
Russian commercial banks, who are over-dependent on now devalued
ruble assets. The government and Central Bank said they would pool
the resources of leading banks to limit the damage.
	   They also proposed legislation to strengthen controls over
Russian financial markets in an effort to halt further capital
flight.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov announced that parliament is
likely to hold an emergency session later this week.
	   ``It is a full-scale bankruptcy'' of Yeltsin's policies,
Zyuganov said.
	   Yeltsin has long called on the opposition-dominated parliament
to convene a special session to endorse austerity measures demanded
by the International Monetary Fund. In the absence of parliamentary
approval, Yeltsin has imposed many of the measures by decree.

	   LEEUWARDEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Fire swept through a center
housing refugees seeking asylum early Monday. Five people were
burned, one seriously.
	   Authorities in this northern Dutch city said 80 people were

Pakistan returns bombing suspect to Nairobi

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The entourage of FBI agents grows in
Nairobi as more investigators try to learn whether the trail of
evidence from the deadly embassy bombing leads to at least one
suspect arrested abroad and returned to Kenya.
	   Amid a flurry of reports and other indications that the
investigation into the Aug. 7 blasts in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, was picking up momentum, the FBI said it would issue a
joint statement later Monday.
	   In the wake of reports that a man had confessed to the bombing
in Pakistan before being flown back to Nairobi, a Kenyan newspaper
reported Monday that FBI agents had flown another suspect back
following his arrest in the United Arab Emirates.
	   The East African, citing airport sources, said the suspect is a
Pakistani national who was arrested in Dubai and flown to Nairobi
on Friday on a U.S. military plane. The report did not give the
suspect's name or specify his alleged role in the bombing.
	   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Bill Barr, and
Kenyan police both declined comment Monday morning. A Pakistani
Embassy spokesman, Malik Ashraf, said he was unaware of the second
reported arrest.
	   In Pakistan on Monday, most U.S. Embassy personnel were leaving
and other Americans were urged to join them after the interrogation
and reported confession of Mohammad Sadik Howaida.
	   The U.S. State Department updated its ``worldwide caution'' for
Americans, warning specifically against all travel to Pakistan and
referring to ``subsequent threats,'' without elaborating.
	   The Pakistan Foreign Ministry and another government source said
Sunday that Howaida was handed over to Kenyan authorities last
week, bypassing U.S. investigators in Pakistan.
	   The Pakistani national newspaper The News, quoting unnamed
government sources, said Sadik gave a determined confession to
planning the bombings and claimed the attack was sponsored by Osama
bin Laden, a Saudi harbored in neighboring Afghanistan who U.S.
officials have identified as a possible suspect.
	   The News said Sadik is a 34-year-old Palestinian engineer. He
reportedly told investigators six other conspirators slipped
through the Karachi airport Aug. 7 and apparently made it to
Afghanistan, where they had been told they would be congratulated
by bin Laden.
	   A Pakistani spokesman said Sadik was arrested on his arrival at
the Karachi airport from Nairobi on the day of the twin bombings
that killed 257 people and injured more than 5,500.
	   A government source in Pakistan, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Sadik was returned Friday to Nairobi.
	   U.S. officials in Islamabad and Nairobi refused to discuss
Sadik.
	   ``This is a matter in which we are working very closely and very
hard with our Kenyan colleagues. I can't make any comment,'' said
the FBI's assistant agent-in-charge of the Nairobi investigation,
Hardrick Crawford. ``This is an ongoing investigation.''
	   U.S. officials have said that bin Laden, who has been vocal in
his hatred of the United States and is among the world's most
militant sponsors of terrorism, was a possible suspect in the
African bombings.
	   Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf said
immigration officials determined that Howaida's Yemeni passport was
forged, and he was interrogated by Pakistani officials.
	   A ministry statement identified Howaida as an ``Arab national''
without elaboration, a phrase that in Pakistan usually means
someone from the Middle East.
	   Signaling another potential step forward in the case, Newsweek
magazine reported that investigators have found a 220-kilogram
(100-pound) steel driveshaft believed to have belonged to the
pickup truck that carried the bomb to the embassy in Nairobi. The
shaft, found a kilometer (more than a half-mile) from the site,
contains part of the vehicle identification number, the magazine
said, quoting unidentified sources.
	   In Washington, FBI spokeswoman Debbie Weierman would not comment
on the report.
	   Meanwhile, the mourning and the cleanup both continue in
Nairobi.
	   American workers wearing helmets were going through the damaged
embassy building over the weekend, occasionally pulling out
magnifying glasses to inspect something before tossing it out the
window onto a heap below.

Court upholds jail sentence for Briton convicted of forgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A high court has upheld a five-year prison
sentence given a British businessman convicted of forgery, his
lawyer said Monday.
	   But attorney Fadhel al-Jumaili said he expects his client, Ian
Beaumont, 32, of Wetherby, West Yorkshire, to be included in the
next pardon announced by Kuwait's ruler because of his good
behavior in prison.
	   ``He has been in prison for around two years, and I expect this
will be his last,'' al-Jumaili told The Associated Press.
	   The annual amnesty is usually announced on National Day in
February. The ruling by the Cassation Court, which is final, was
issued in June but not immediately made public.
	   Beaumont was found guilty in November 1996 of forging a money
transfer from a Lebanese businessman's account at the Gulf Bank to
his own account in a Swiss bank. He denied the charges and insisted
he had nothing to do with the transaction.

South Korean Roman Catholic priest to face arrest

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to remove garble &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean Roman Catholic priest
may face arrest for engaging in political activities during his
just ended visit to North Korea, officials said Monday.
	   The Rev. Moon Kyu-hyon and eight other South Korean Catholic
priests were allowed to make a week-long visit to North Korea on
condition that they attend only religious functions celebrating the
Aug. 15 Korean Independence Day.
	   But Moon attended a series of political functions sponsored by
North Korea to denounce rival South Korea, government officials
said.
	   ``As far as we know, his activities and remarks as reported by
North Korean media seriously violated what he had promised in
writing not to attend political functions,'' one Unification
Ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said Moon may be arrested when he returns to Seoul
this week.
	   Moon serves as a co-chairman of the (South) Korean Catholic
Priests' Council for Justice, a human rights group.
	   He was convicted in 1990 of making an unauthorized visit to
North Korea and served three years of a five-year prison term
before being granted amnesty by the government.
	   No one from either North or South Korea can visit the other side
without approval from their governments, which is rarely given.
	   The Koreas have been bitter rivals since the division of their
peninsula into the communist North and the capitalist South in
1945. They fought a bloody three-year war in the early 1950s.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ American millionaire adventurer Steve
Fossett gave a thumbs up to his rescuers and said he was fine
Monday, hours after the balloon he was trying to fly around the
world crashed into the sea, authorities said.
	   Fossett has been in regular radio contact with a Royal
Australian Air Force Hercules C-130 since about lunchtime Monday,
when a rescue plane from Sydney reached the balloon crash site in
the Coral Sea, east of Australia.
	   ``He reports being fine,'' Australian Maritime Safety Authority
spokesman Robin Poke told The Associated Press.
	   A French military plane dropped a 15-man life raft to Fossett at
about 8.40 a.m. (2240 GMT Sunday) Monday, after reaching the site
near the Chesterfield islands, about 500 miles (800 km) off
Australia's east coast, the French Navy in Noumea, New Caledonia,
said.
	   The French plane circled Fossett until its fuel began to run
low, then headed back to its home base in Noumea, Poke said.
	   ``He has been waving to the aircraft as they fly overhead,
giving the thumbs-up,'' said New Zealand defense forces spokesman
Lt.-Cmdr. Bill Morley.
	   The New Zealand Navy tanker Endeavour is one of three vessels
rushing to the site. An Australian ketch, the Atlanta, was closest
and skipper Laurie Piper said he expected to reach Fossett by about
7:00 p.m. local time (0900 GMT).
	   ``We'll have a dinghy with an outboard ready to launch,'' Piper
told The Associated Press by radio phone.
	   ``We'll pick him up as soon as we get there and bring him on
board, give him a cup of coffee, wrap him up and put a good feed in
him.''
	   Seas in the area were relatively calm but authorities are
concerned because the area is littered with coral reefs which may
be full of sharks, are hard to detect by radar and dangerous to
even the largest vessels.
	   Endeavor's Commander Kevin Calls said he expected to arrive at
the site at about midnight Monday (1400 GMT), and would assess the
situation before sending out small inflatable boats to attempt a
rescue.
	   If Atlanta had not picked him up and a nighttime rescue was
considered too dangerous, Calls said he would wait until first
light.
	   ``It's not going to be worth risking too much to rescue him. He
seems to be in reasonable health _ its not as though there's a
hurry to save his life,'' Calls told The Associated Press.

South Korea finally has a prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's Parliament finally
ratified Kim Jong-pil as prime minister Monday, six months after
the veteran politician was nominated by the president.
	   Approval came on a 171-65 vote after the opposition Grand
National Party was given the chairmanships of six of the General
Assembly's 13 committees, including defense and foreign affairs.
	   President Kim Dae-jung nominated his coalition government
partner, Kim Jong-pil, to be prime minister right after he took
office on Feb. 25.
	   But the Grand National Party, which holds a majority of seats in
the unicameral assembly, refused to go along and tied up the
nomination in procedural disputes.
	   The president bypassed that difficulty by naming Kim Jong-pil
acting prime minister without parliamentary approval, a move the
opposition claimed was illegal.
	   That dispute and others tied the assembly in knots and it has
accomplished almost no work, despite a crushing economic crisis
that has gripped the nation since late last year.
	   Under mounting public pressure to get something done, the rival
parties compromised on distribution of committee chairmanships over
the weekend and agreed to bring up the nomination for a vote.

Major Albanian stronghold falls to Serb police

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces captured three more
villages in western Kosovo, pushing ethnic Albanian militants away
from the province's second-largest city, media reported Monday.
	   Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency said Serb police
``crushed'' important strongholds of the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army in the villages of Lodja, Grabovac and Rausic, all just
outside the province's second city of Pec.
	   The push comes a day after the Serbs gained control of the
rebels' main logistical and weapons distribution center, forcing
the KLA to flee into the surrounding hills and forests, abandoning
weapons and ammunition.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported government
forces reportedly used tanks and helicopters to attack the village
of Lodja, 70 kilometers (55 miles) southwest of Pristina, and eight
other villages in the area. The center also claimed Serb forces
razed Lodja.
	   There was no immediate information on casualties and the reports
could not be independently confirmed.
	   The KLA is fighting Serb security forces for the independence of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the province's
2 million people. Kosovo is in Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   Over the past two weeks, government forces have succeeded in
driving the KLA from several key villages in western Kosovo.
Government gains have, however, proven difficult to maintain, as
the KLA simply return to an area the moment police move on.
	   Tens of thousands of refugees also remain camped in the woods in
western Kosovo. The U.N. refugee agency based in Geneva, said
Monday it was sending its second in command to meet with leaders on
both sides to call for a cessation of hostilities and full access
for humanitarian operations, spokesman Kris Janowski said.
	   On Sunday, the agency received reports of some 20,000 people
holed up in the woods east of Decane, near Junik, Janowski said.
	   Reporters who visited Junik Sunday found the village deserted,
except for about 15 elderly people who were too old to flee. Some
houses were still smoldering, but most of the village remained
intact.
	   According to Col. Bozidar Filic, a police spokesman, there were
no civilian casualties in the fighting over the town of Junik.
Tanjug said four policemen and two Yugoslav army soldiers died in
the operation. There were no immediate reports of causalities on
the Albanian side.
	   Filic said that by wiping out the rebel stronghold, ``the
territory of Kosovo has been freed for movement in all directions.'
But since fighting began five months ago, gains by government
forces have proven difficult to maintain and it remained possible
the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army could still regroup.
	   Last week, the militant organization named Adem Demaci as the
leader of its political wing. Demaci refuses to work with his arch
rival, moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova, who is favored by the West.
	   The Serb government in Belgrade has invited Rugova's negotiating
team to start peace talks as early as this week.
	   But Rugova had said earlier the government offensive must stop
before he would return to the negotiating table. Rugova favors
independence, but lacks the support of the KLA because he opposes
the use of violence.

Official sentenced to eight years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A Ho Chi Minh City official has been
sentenced to eight years in jail for embezzling money from the
hunger-elimination and poverty-alleviation fund, a court official
said Monday.
	   Luu My Hoa, 44, chairwoman of District 5's Precinct 10 for three
years until her removal in August 1996, was convicted Saturday of
taking 420 million dong (dlrs 32,000) _ a huge amount in a country
where the average annual per capita income is about dlrs 300.
	   The Communist Party and central government have launched a
campaign to ensure citizen rights. Local governments are required
to have transparency in their finances.
	   The campaign was sparked by local corruption that has led to
unrest in several provinces in the last two years.

Cambodian opposition accuses Canadian election advisor of bias
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian opposition leaders on
Monday accused a senior Canadian election advisor of being biased
in favor of Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen's ruling party.
	   They said comments made by the advisor in a private letter
raised questions about Canada's role in the electoral process.
	   Theo Noel, the senior technical advisor to the National Election
Committee, was sharply critical of the opposition for refusing to
recognize the results of the July 36 election, won by Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party.
	   Noel said in a leaked internal document that their allegations
about fraud were ``groundless.''
	   ``The opposition parties, in my view, should now accept the
results of the election and should stop identifying scapegoats to
cover up their divisions and their weakness,'' he wrote in a letter
to Canadian ambassador Gordon Longmuir, also well-known for his
criticism of the opposition.
	   ``I also think that the international community should cut short
supporting the opposition's claims which, up to now, were proven
groundless,'' he wrote.
	   In fact, the election committee dismissed hundreds of opposition
complaints without any investigation. The committee is dominated by
supporters of Hun Sen's party.
	   Noel has defended the letter as a private document representing
his personal views.
	   Prominent opposition politician Sam Rainsy on Monday released
the text of a two-page letter he had sent to Canadian Minister of
Foreign Affairs Lloyd Axworthy, saying that Noel's comments and
tone ``indicate he sides with the ruling party and has sided with
them for some time.''
	   Whatever the reason, he wrote, ``I believe it is entirely
inappropriate for foreign-funded technical advisor to base his
advise on personal bias.''
	   If Noel's actions represent the role Canada and other foreign
advisors played in the elections, ``the implications are very
serious indeed,'' Sam Rainsy wrote.
	   He said his opposition ally, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, is
expected to also sign the letter Monday afternoon.
	   Cambodian held parliamentary elections last month, one year
after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup
d'etat.
	   The international community provided over dlrs 34 million in
funds to help hold the polls and quickly gave the electoral process
a post-election stamp of approval in what the opposition and some
independent observers considered a rush to judgment.
	   Critics have accused the international community of endorsing a
process which favored Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party because
they saw his victory as necessary in bringing political stability
back to the country.

Police arrest five suspects on suspicion of Omagh bombing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Combines urgent series, adds bomb threat at Stormont &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police arrested five suspects
Monday on suspicion of involvement of the Omagh bombing that killed
28 and wounded 220.
	   An officer in the Royal Ulster Constabulary, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the five were arrested at dawn in
their homes near Omagh, 70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast.
	   Some of those arrested lived in the village of Mountjoy, 3 miles
(5 kms) north of Omagh, others from the village of Sixmilecross 8
miles (13 kms) to the southeast.
	   Among those arrested, the officer said, is a relative of Omagh
politician Dessie Mackey, who earlier this year resigned from the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party over its decision to accept the Northern
Ireland peace agreement.
	   The officer cautioned that charges against any of the suspects
was not imminent and under Northern Ireland anti-terrorist law they
could be interrogated for up to a week before being charged or
released.
	   This marked the first concrete action by Northern Ireland's
security forces in response to the Saturday car bomb in Omagh,
which has been widely blamed on a dissident Irish Republican Army
group.
	   At Stormont, the center of British administration for Northern
Ireland in east Belfast, meanwhile, staff were evacuated after a
telephoned bomb threat.
	   In recent months there's been several hoax calls made to
different government buildings within the complex.
	   Monday's alert affected the building that houses the Department
of Agriculture, Dundonald House.
	   Police said they were investigating a telephone warning saying
there is a bomb in a parking lot.

Defiant Kabila calls on people to resist rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ With an army of rebel fighters closing in
on his capital, a defiant President Laurent Kabila said in a radio
broadcast Monday his government will arm the people and prevail.
	   The embattled president also lashed out at the international
community and accused the West of plotting against his government.
	   The West ``has never been supportive of President Kabila simply
because I do not represent their interests,,'' Kabila said on
state-controlled Voice of the People radio. ``We have come and we
will stay here. In any case, the aggressors will fail.''
	   The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters, Rwandan
soldiers and disenchanted members of Kabila's military _ have been
making steady progress toward the capital, a western diplomat said
on condition of anonymity.
	   Charging Kabila with corruption and nepotism, rebel leaders
driving to topple the government have captured the western Congo
River port town of Matadi.
	   Many in the rebel movement helped Kabila oust longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997, but now say they have been
marginalized by the government.
	   A diplomat in Kinshasa said he had received reports from his
government that the rebels were now near the town of Mbanza-Ngungu,
about 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of the capital.
	   Kabila said Congo was the victim of a plot by neighboring Rwanda
_ which he says is orchestrating the rebellion _ along with the
West.
	   ``The next 24 hours will be decisive,'' Kabila said. ``We must
understand that we must win. This is the message I have for my
people, I am asking them to face up to this plot, to arm
themselves, to support their army, and to defeat the aggressors.''
	   He did not elaborate on why the following 24 hours were so
important.
	   Facing a worsening crisis, Kabila called an emergency meeting of
his staff and Cabinet on Monday.
	   Kabila returned Sunday to Kinshasa from the Angolan capital of
Luanda, where he met with the presidents of Namibia and Angola.
	   The topics discussed at the meetings were not released publicly,
but the leaders recommended have scheduled a meeting of regional
defense ministers in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare.
	   ``The heads of state expressed their concern over the intensity
of military actions in (Congo), jeopardizing the stability of the
southern African region,'' Angolan television said.
	   In Kinshasa, although tense, life was continuing as normal. Most
shops were open and markets were crowded with people buying extra
provisions.
	   Heavily armed troops have closed all roads leading from Kinshasa
to Lower Congo province, where the rebels are mounting their
advance on the capital.
	   Hundreds of westerners left Kinshasa over the weekend, while a
team of 50 British commandos has been deployed to Brazzaville, the
capital of the neighboring Republic of Congo, to help the
evacuation of British subjects.
	   An Royal Air Force Hercules carrying 50 soldiers flew over the
weekend from Ascension Island, where the Marines had been on
standby, to Brazzaville, the Britain's Ministry of Defence said.
	   The deployment of British troops in Brazzaville did not mean
there were immediate plans to withdraw British nationals, a
ministry spokesman said.
	   Brazzaville is directly across the Congo River from Kinshasa.
	   French troops already in Brazzaville helped hundreds of French,
Belgian and other foreigners cross the river on Saturday. From
Brazzaville _ still scarred from last year's civil war in the
Republic of Congo _ the evacuees were flown to safety.
	   Despite apparent military setbacks, the Congolese government
said Sunday that it was securing bases in the east and west of the
country in order to attack rebel forces.
	   In eastern Congo, rebel commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said
Monday his forces had taken the town of Lubutu, which is 210
kilometers (125 miles) from Kisangani, Congo's second-largest city.
	   Kabila's government has drawn support from the public in
Kinshasa by characterizing the rebel movement as a Rwandan Tutsi
war against Congo. Rwanda denies the charge.
	   Tutsis, an ethnic minority centered in eastern Congo and
neighboring countries, including Rwanda, have become the target of
attacks and arbitrary detentions in Kinshasa.

Import ban sends motorbike prices soaring

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A ban on motorbike imports has sent prices
soaring for Vietnam's preferred method of transportation.
	   The ban, announced last month in an effort to reduce the
country's trade deficit, has pushed the price for the most popular
model, the Thai-made Honda Dream II, to dlrs 2,900, up dlrs 600
from six months ago.
	   The government has granted licences for six motorbike joint
ventures with a total capacity of 900,000 units per year. Four
joint ventures have been turning out some 200,000 units per year.
	   The Industry Ministry estimates annual demand at 500,000 units.
	   Roughly 90 percent of Vietnam's traffic is on two wheels. As
people save money, one of their top priorities is to switch from
bicycles to motorbikes.

Six more deaths in weekend rains that hit southern South Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Torrential rains continued to buffet
South Korea over the weekend, causing six new deaths in the
populous southern coastal regions, anti-disaster officials said
Monday.
	   The latest deaths increased to 271 the total number of dead in
two weeks of downpours that began to hit South Korea in early
August. Over 160,000 people were left homeless and property damage
was estimated at dlrs 2 billion.
	   The latest deaths included four people who were buried in a
landslide. One man died when his car fell into a rain-swollen river
and another was swept into a flooded ditch.
	   Weather officials said the strong rain fronts were swept in from
China.
	   A week before the two-week deluge began, 57 people were killed
and 29 went missing in flash floods raging down mountain valleys in
the southern tip of the Korean peninsula.

Major Albanian stronghold falls to Serb police

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Serbs taking three Albanian villages, details,
information from UNHCR. Trims. CHANGES Logja to Lodja throughout.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces captured three more
villages in western Kosovo, pushing ethnic Albanian militants away
from the province's second-largest city, media reported Monday.
	   Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency said Serb police
``crushed'' important strongholds of the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army in the villages of Lodja, Grabovac and Rausic, all just
outside the province's second city of Pec.
	   The push comes a day after the Serbs gained control of the
rebels' main logistical and weapons distribution center, forcing
the KLA to flee into the surrounding hills and forests, abandoning
weapons and ammunition.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported government
forces reportedly used tanks and helicopters to attack the village
of Lodja, 70 kilometers (55 miles) southwest of Pristina, and eight
other villages in the area. The center also claimed Serb forces
razed Lodja.
	   There was no immediate information on casualties and the reports
could not be independently confirmed.
	   The KLA is fighting Serb security forces for the independence of
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the province's
2 million people. Kosovo is in Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   Over the past two weeks, government forces have succeeded in
driving the KLA from several key villages in western Kosovo.
Government gains have, however, proven difficult to maintain, as
the KLA simply return to an area the moment police move on.
	   Tens of thousands of refugees also remain camped in the woods in
western Kosovo. The U.N. refugee agency based in Geneva, said
Monday it was sending its second in command to meet with leaders on
both sides to call for a cessation of hostilities and full access
for humanitarian operations, spokesman Kris Janowski said.
	   On Sunday, the agency received reports of some 20,000 people
holed up in the woods east of Decane, near Junik, Janowski said.
	   Reporters who visited Junik Sunday found the village deserted,
except for about 15 elderly people who were too old to flee. Some
houses were still smoldering, but most of the village remained
intact.
	   According to Col. Bozidar Filic, a police spokesman, there were
no civilian casualties in the fighting over the town of Junik.
Tanjug said four policemen and two Yugoslav army soldiers died in
the operation. There were no immediate reports of causalities on
the Albanian side.
	   Filic said that by wiping out the rebel stronghold, ``the
territory of Kosovo has been freed for movement in all
directions.'' But since fighting began five months ago, gains by
government forces have proven difficult to maintain and it remained
possible the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army could still regroup.
	   Last week, the militant organization named Adem Demaci as the
leader of its political wing. Demaci refuses to work with his arch
rival, moderate leader Ibrahim Rugova, who is favored by western
nations.
	   The Serb government in Belgrade has invited Rugova's negotiating
team to start peace talks as early as this week.
	   But Rugova had said earlier the government offensive must stop
before he would return to the negotiating table. Rugova favors
independence, but lacks the support of the KLA because he opposes
the use of violence.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Defying a police ban, more than 100 Beijing
students gathered outside Indonesia's embassy Monday to protest
brutality against ethnic Chinese during riots in Indonesia in May.
	   In a separate display of anger, Chinese women horrified at the
rapes committed during the riots appealed to the United Nations to
investigate the atrocities and accused their own government of
reacting late and faintheartedly.
	   ``We want to push the government to take stronger action,'' said
novelist Zhang Kangkang, one of about 40 women who met in a hotel
after police refused them permission to demonstrate outside the
embassy.
	   Placards put up in the hotel dining hall where the women met
demanded justice. ``A debt of blood should be repaid in blood,''
one said. ``Women's human rights cannot be trampled on,'' said
another.
	   China's Foreign Ministry has urged Indonesia's government to
severely punish rioters who singled out Chinese-owned homes and
businesses for looting and burning and who raped and murdered
ethnic Chinese women.
	   The students who gathered outside the Indonesian Embassy and
demanded to see the ambassador did so even though police last week
refused to grant permission for a demonstration, citing public
order concerns.
	   Dozens of police kept the students from entering the fenced-off,
guarded compound housing the embassy and other diplomatic offices
and residences.
	   After prolonged negotiations, the police allowed four students
to enter the compound to meet an embassy spokesman and to hand over
documents and a T-shirt bearing the slogan ``Protest the violence,
punish the murderers.''
	   The four demanded to know what action Indonesia planned to take
to protect ethnic Chinese from further attacks and called for an
accounting of the government's actions in the May unrest and an end
to laws that discriminate against ethnic Chinese.
	   When the four emerged from the compound, their 100 or so fellow
protesters, who were waiting across the street, erupted into
cheers.
	   The students unfurled a banner in English that read ``All these
things to be answered for.'' But police made them take it down
within seconds. Police also prevented reporters from speaking with
the students.
	   Chinese authorities are wary of any civic protests, fearful that
they could escalate into larger demonstrations against the
government. Officials are doubly anxious to keep a lid on any
protests at Beijing university campuses because they initiated
massive pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989.
	   After their meeting, about 10 members of the women's group of
writers and journalists also went to the embassy to hand over a
letter urging Indonesia to punish those responsible for the rapes
and attacks. But they turned back after seeing the heavy police
guard around the embassy, said one of the women involved.

NATO flexes military muscle to help contain Kosovo crisis

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ As a dozen jetfighters soared overhead,
about 1,700 troops from the United States and other countries began
a five-day military exercise Monday to show the Alliance's
readiness to contain the crisis in neighboring Kosovo province.
	   Security was heightened because of concern over Islamic
extremists following explosions at U.S. Embassies in Africa and the
arrest of several Egyptians here, reportedly in connection with
religious violence in Egypt.
	   Albanian troops cordoned off the air base adjacent to Rinas
International Airport where the opening ceremony was held. American
and German troops also manned checkpoints.
	   Troops from 14 nations will conduct training for parachute
supply drops, vehicle and foot patrols, marksmanship and other
non-offensive drills in the Albanian mountains. The participants
include 11 NATO members plus Russia, Albania and Lithuania.
	   Ten other nations have sent observers. Russia's Itar-TASS news
agency said the Russians agreed to participate after NATO promised
the to ensure the exercises would be as `` politically sterile'' as
possible.
	   Navy Capt. Steve Burnette, spokesman for the exercise, said the
operation, ``Cooperative Assembly 1998,'' was to ``provide
stability and help contain a regional crisis.''
	   The Americans and Europeans fear the fighting in Serbia's Kosovo
province, where ethnic Albanians are fighting for independence,
could spill over into neighboring countries with large Albanian
communities.
	   Hundreds have died in fighting in Kosovo since Serb police
cracked down on the separatist KLA in February. Last week, the
Alliance announced plans for a second exercise in Macedonia Sept.
10-18.
	   ``We want to have an impact that NATO is just around the
corner,'' U.S. Adm. Joe Lopez, NATO commander of Allied
Forces-South, told reporters. ``Belgrade and any belligerents in
the region will get the same message _ that NATO is ready. NATO has
a wide range of contingencies and options ranging from peace
support to combat operations.''
	   Albania's defense minister, Luan Hajdaraga, said the the NATO
show of force ``is important to discourage'' any move by the
Serb-led Yugoslav government to drive ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
	   Although the Albanian government supports a peaceful solution to
the crisis, rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army maintain bases in
the north of the country, from where they smuggle arms and
ammunition into Serbia.
	   The Albanians here are struggling restore the structures of
government, including effective internal security, after last
year's nationwide riots which exploded following the collapse of
pyramid investment schemes which bankrupted much of the population.
	   As military bands played the national anthems of participating
countries, a dozen jets from six nations flew overhead in a display
of military power. In addition to the military portion of Rinas
airport, exercises will take place in three other locations: a
training area Bize, the village of Kunje and the capital Tirana.
	   Despite NATO's commitment to stability here, the exercise began
as American diplomats were and their families were leaving Albania
as a precaution following the attacks on the U.S. Embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania, which killed 257 people.
	   Washington has also warned Americans against traveling to
Albania and offered to assist any of its 890 citizens registered
with the embassy to leave the country.
	   Recent reports that Albanian and U.S. authorities cooperated in
arresting at least five Egyptians in Albania who were suspected of
international terrorist links has heightened fears over the safety
of American citizens.
	   Burnette said security was normally strict for NATO exercises
but acknowledged that controls had been tightened ``because of some
threats by Islamic groups.'' He declined to elaborate.
	   The largest contingent in the exercise comes from Italy which
sent about 500 troops. The Italians increased their participation
after the Americans scaled down their numbers because some warships
were diverted to Africa to provide security for Americans in the
Congo, where rebels are seeking to oust President Laurent Kabila.
	   Other large-scale participants, including the Americans,
Germans, French, Turks and Canadians, have sent about 200 troops
each.

Tajik authorities identify four suspects in killing of U.N.
</HEADLINE>
workers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ The government has identified four
suspects in last month's killing of United Nations workers, and is
negotiating with the opposition for their arrest, officials said
Monday.
	   The suspects are on the territory controlled by the coalition of
main opposition groups, said Tajik Security Minister Saidamir
Zukhurov. Opposition spokesman Sulton Khamadov also confirmed that
negotiations are going on for the suspects' extradition.
	   The four U.N. workers were ambushed July 20 while on a regular
patrol in the mountains about 90 miles (140 kilometers) east of the
capital Dushanbe. All were shot in the the head.
	   Tajik officials initially claimed that the U.N. observers had
died when their car plunged off a cliff. But later they confirmed
the U.N. report of an ambush.
	   Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov has fired two deputy defense
ministers and reprimanded several top officials for failing to
prevent the attack. He ordered an increase in protection for U.N.
workers in Tajikistan.
	   The main opposition alliance condemned the shootings. It said
the U.N. workers were killed after they met the opposition
commander in the Tavildara region, and were heading for the
government-controlled Garm region.
	   About 70 U.N. observers are stationed in Tajikistan to monitor a
peace deal reached last year that ended five years of civil war in
the former Soviet republic.
	   Despite the peace accord, Tajikistan remains restive. There are
periodic clashes between the hard-line government and the mostly
Islamic opposition. Also, many warlords do not recognize the peace
deal and wage turf battles with one another.
	   The four U.N. workers were: Maj. Ryszard Szcwczyk of Poland;
Maj. Adolfo Sharpegue of Uruguay; civil affairs officer Yutaka
Akino of Japan and a Tajik translator, Jourajon Mahramov.

Singapore bourse hits a new 10-year low, currency weakens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's stock market continued to slide
Monday, falling to its lowest level in more than 10 years and
hurting the Singapore dollar.
	   Markets in the affluent city-state were growing increasingly
susceptible to the regional economic turmoil, traders said.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index skidded 2.9
percent, or 28.65 points, to 945.49. The last time the index closed
below this level was in April 21 1988.
	   The drift below the psychologically important support level of
1000 began last Tuesday, when markets opened after a Monday state
holiday. The index has plummeted more than 35 percent since the
start of the year, when it stood at 1529.84 points.
	   The weak Singapore bourse, aggravated by the weakening of the
Japanese yen, also undermined interest in the Singapore dollar,
which was trading late Monday at 1.76 Singapore dollars to the U.S.
dollar.
	   Cushioned from the most dramatic effects of the regional
financial crisis last year, Singapore is now increasingly feeling
the effects of its trading partners' deteriorating economies and
devaluing currencies.
	   Economists are no longer surprised at major drops in the
Singapore market, and expect it will continue to decline.
	   ``We expect something like a minus 3.5 percent GDP growth next
year,'' said Chia Yew Boon, head of securities research at
Santander Investment Singapore.
	   ``This is really far worse than the last recession'' in the
early 1980s, he said. ``It's difficult to see the bottom right
now.''
	   Santander Investment and other analysts said the Singapore
dollar may have to depreciate by about 30 percent on a real
effective exchange rate basis for Singapore to recover its relative
competitiveness.
	   The latest Singapore research report by U.S. investment bank JP
Morgan said the Singapore dollar ``might need to weaken to around 2
Singapore dollars to the U.S. dollar and even beyond (all else
being equal) in the next few months just to restore
competitiveness.''
	   ``Singapore appears to be losing not only some of its
competitiveness and hence market share in its primary markets, such
as the U.S. and the E.U., but potentially also some of its
traditional role in intermediate electronics,'' economist Ong Sin
Beng said in the report.
	   In a speech Saturday night, Singapore's Senior Minister Lee Kuan
Yew predicted: ``We will have a budget deficit this year, next
year, and maybe the year after.''

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Celebrating Indonesia's national day,
flag-bearing officers strutted at the presidential palace Monday
while traditional dancers sashayed for political prisoners in a
jail yard.
	   In an annual custom, the government cut prison terms for 16,800
inmates, 95 of them political prisoners.
	   Almost 1,600 inmates were to be freed to celebrate the
anniversary, including three elderly prisoners thrown behind bars
in the 1960s for allegedly taking part in a communist coup attempt.
	   From five-star hotels to slum shacks, red and white Indonesian
flags and banners festooned the capital, a festive display belying
the economic hardship that millions are suffering.
	   Police and soldiers were posted at intersections following
rumors that riots might break out during the celebrations, but the
streets were quiet.
	   With Indonesia's economic turmoil stripping people of jobs and
driving up prices, fears linger of more deadly unrest like the
riots in May that helped oust former autocratic President Suharto.
	   Some ethnic Chinese, whose shops and homes were targeted in the
Jakarta upheaval that killed about 1,200 people, left the country
amid rumors of violence on Monday.
	   Despite the uncertainty, President B.J. Habibie presided over a
show of pomp on the lawn of his palace, saluting phalanxes of
soldiers and waving to choirs of schoolchildren.
	   Foreign ambassadors and government officials were on hand for a
flag-raising ceremony. Indonesia declared independence from Dutch
colonial rule in 1945. The Dutch left four years later after
failing to quell nationalist forces in a war.
	   Suharto, whose hold on power was dislodged by riots over price
increases and student protests, did not attend.
	   On Saturday, Habibie made a marathon speech to Parliament in
which he apologized for widespread human rights abuses during
Suharto's 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   The government said Monday it had granted amnesty on
humanitarian grounds to Pujo Prasetyo, 70, Manan Effendi, 80, and
Alexander Warrouw, 80, who were jailed for life for involvement in
what authorities have said was an abortive communist coup in 1965.
	   An army general at the time, Suharto's troops crushed the
alleged coup and took over the presidency after a bloody backlash
against the Communist Party.
	   The sentence reductions Monday also allowed some 1,590
prisoners, most of them common criminals nearing the end of their
terms, to walk free.
	   At Jakarta's Cipinang jail, political prisoners said Habibie
should prove his commitment to democratic reform by releasing all
jailed opponents of Suharto. So far, he has released dozens.
	   ``We've been treated by the Habibie regime as a commodity,''
said pro-democracy activist Budiman Sudjatmiko, whose 13-year
prison term for subversion was cut by one month.
	   Budiman heads the People's Democratic Party, a political party
that was banned under Suharto but has since been legalized.
	   Xanana Gusmao, the jailed rebel leader of the disputed territory
of East Timor, was granted a four-month reduction in his 20-year
sentence.
	   Performing in the prison, traditional dancers from western Java
island prayed and pressed knives and needles into their bodies
without suffering serious injury.
	   The inmates later played games, climbing up a flagpole to grab
prizes, such as T-shirts or bottles of water.
	   In a snub to Habibie, prominent opposition figure Megawati
Sukarnoputri, who is the eldest daughter of Indonesia's founding
President Sukarno, staged her own independence ceremony in Jakarta.
	   ``It's better for me to be with the people together, feeling all
the difficulties and concerns,'' Megawati told several hundred
supporters, some wearing headbands with slogans that read
``Reform.''
	   Megawati, who urged democratic change when Suharto was in power,
was ousted as leader of the minority Indonesian Democratic Party in
June 1996 by a government-backed party faction.

Cambodian opposition accuses Canadian election advisor of bias

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS election date in 3rd graf to July 26; ADDS 12th graf
with query to Axworthy; edits to conform

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian opposition leaders on
Monday accused a senior Canadian election advisor of being biased
in favor of Co-Prime Minister Hun Sen's ruling party.
	   They said comments made by the advisor in a private letter
raised questions about Canada's role in the electoral process.
	   Theo Noel, the senior technical advisor to the National Election
Committee, was sharply critical of the opposition for refusing to
recognize the results of the July 26 election, won by Hun Sen's
Cambodian People's Party.
	   Noel said in a leaked internal document that their allegations
about fraud were ``groundless.''
	   ``The opposition parties, in my view, should now accept the
results of the election and should stop identifying scapegoats to
cover up their divisions and their weakness,'' he wrote in a letter
to Canadian ambassador Gordon Longmuir, also well-known for his
criticism of the opposition.
	   ``I also think that the international community should cut short
supporting the opposition's claims which, up to now, were proven
groundless,'' he wrote.
	   In fact, the election committee dismissed hundreds of opposition
complaints without any investigation. The committee is dominated by
supporters of Hun Sen's party.
	   Noel has defended the letter as a private document representing
his personal views.
	   Prominent opposition politician Sam Rainsy on Monday released
the text of a two-page letter he had sent to Canadian Minister of
Foreign Affairs Lloyd Axworthy, saying that Noel's comments and
tone ``indicate he sides with the ruling party and has sided with
them for some time.''
	   Whatever the reason, he wrote, ``I believe it is entirely
inappropriate for foreign-funded technical advisor to base his
advise on personal bias.''
	   If Noel's actions represent the role Canada and other foreign
advisors played in the elections, ``the implications are very
serious indeed,'' Sam Rainsy wrote.
	   The letter called on Axworthy to ``clarify whether Mr. Noel's
statements and actions are within the scope of the duties of a
Canadian-funded election advisor and whether his stated views
represent the views of the Foreign Ministry of Canada.''
	   Sam Rainsy said his opposition ally, Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
is expected to also sign the letter Monday afternoon.
	   Cambodian held parliamentary elections last month, one year
after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent coup
d'etat.
	   The international community provided over dlrs 34 million in
funds to help hold the polls and quickly gave the electoral process
a post-election stamp of approval in what the opposition and some
independent observers considered a rush to judgment.
	   Critics have accused the international community of endorsing a
process which favored Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party because
they saw his victory as necessary in bringing political stability
back to the country.

Philippine peso, stocks close lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso fell against the
U.S. dollar Monday, pushed slightly lower by the devaluation of the
Russian ruble, dealers said.
	   The dollar averaged 43.243 pesos on the Philippine Dealing
System, up 4.4 centavos from 43.199 pesos at Friday's rate.
	   Dealers said the ruble devaluation initially pushed the dollar
to a high of 43.360 pesos, but later settled at 43.250 pesos.
Volume traded was dlrs 109.8 million compared to Friday's dlrs
105.9 million.
	   ``The devaluation of the ruble had an effect, but not a large
one since the market is mostly long on dollars,'' said a trader
from a foreign bank.
	   Market analysts said there was light commercial demand for
dollars at the current rate and potential pressure on the peso
would most likely come from speculative buying.
	   The Philippine Central Bank is expected to keep its high
overnight interest rates throughout the week to repel speculative
attacks on the peso, a trader said.
	   Philippine shares, meanwhile, ended slightly lower Monday,
pulled down by profit-taking toward the close of trading.
	   Preliminary data showed the 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange
index fell 2.21 points to 1335.71 after a strong 34.63-point rise
to 1337.92 on Friday.
	   Early bargain hunting extended Friday's rally following six
straight days of losses until late selling eroded the gains.
	   Continuing concerns over regional and domestic economic
prospects triggered the late selling and the losses would likely
last in the next few days, dealers said.
	   The sectoral indexes were mixed, with the commercial and
industrial and financial counters ending lower.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets fell Monday, with the key
indexes in Malaysia and Thailand tumbling over 3 percent on news of
the devaluation of the Russian ruble.
	   After weeks of financial turmoil, Russia announced Monday that
it would would permit the value of the ruble to fall about 50
percent _ from about 6.3 to the dollar to 9.5 to the dollar.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's key Composite Index plummeted
3.6 percent, or 11.74 points, to 316.24.
	   Dealers said the devaluation of the ruble raised fears that more
currencies may follow suit and the currency crisis, which started
from Asia last July, would be prolonged.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir's remarks at a political rally over the
weekend that the Malaysian government intends to introduce drastic
measures to shore up the country's faltering economy also dampened
market sentiment.
	   Thai shares also slumped on Russia's decision to devalue the
ruble, dealers said.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index fell 8.38 points, or 3.4
percent, to 235.24.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 329.27
points, or 2.18 percent, to close at 14,794.66 _ its lowest since
June 17, and below the pschologically significant 15,000-point
level. On Friday, the Nikkei index sank 258.09 points, or 1.68
percent
	   Traders blamed the drop in part to a worsening of sentiment
following a decline in U.S. stocks traded on Wall Street Friday.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 34.50 points, or
0.4 percent, to 8,425.00, its lowest close since late February and
9.8 percent below its peak of 9,337.97 on July 17.
	   Concerns about a new round of sell-offs in Southeast Asian
currency and stock markets also sent investors scurrying for the
safe haven of the greenback.
	   The dollar was quoted at 146.45 yen in late afternoon, up 1.57
yen from late Friday in Tokyo and above its late New York rate of
146.35 yen.
	   Singapore shares also fell. The main Straits Times Indusrial
Index fell 28.62 points, or 2.9 percent, closing at 945.49.
	   In Taipei, share prices closed lower as investors were worried
about Taiwan's slowing economy. On Friday, the Taiwanese government
cut its 1998 economic growth forecast to 5.3 percent _ the lowest
since 1985 _ from 6.02 percent.
	   The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 97.99
points, or 1.3 percent, to 7,273.85.
	   New Zealand share prices closed lower, with brokers saying the
local market mirrored a fall on the U.S market Friday and investor
caution relating to domestic political uncertainty. The NZSE-40
Capital Index fell 3.60 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,937.97.
	   Philippine shares closed lower on late profit-taking. The
30-share Philippine Stock Exchange index fell 2.21 points, or 0.1
percent, to 1,335.71.
	   Australian share prices also slumped during a gloomy trading
day. The All Ordinaries Index fell 32.2 points, or 1.3 percent, to
2,536.8.
	   In Seoul, share prices closed lower on continued concern over
the unstable Japanese currency. The Korea Composite Stock Price
Index fell 2.99 points, or 0.9 percent, to 301.62.
	   The markets were closed in Hong Kong and Indonesia for holidays.

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Rescue workers in eastern Ukraine have
recovered 20 bodies of coal miners who were killed in a methane
blast and were working to retrieve four more, a news report said
Monday.
	   The bodies of four miners believed killed in the blast on Sunday
remain in remote zones of the 19th Communist Party Congress mine in
the Luhansk region, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Officials working on the site of the explosion said the areas
where the last four dead miners remain were heavily blocked by the
blast and rescue teams would be able to get through them no earlier
than Monday evening.
	   A total of 28 miners were working in the section of the mine
where the explosion occurred. Four survived and are currently
hospitalized with burns.
	   Another 95 miners were underground elsewhere in the mine at the
time of the blast but were evacuated.
	   Five rescue workers who were injured recovering bodies of the
dead miners Sunday were also taken to hospital, officials at the
Luhansk regional department for work safety said.
	   A government commission is working to determine the cause of the
blast, which struck 675 meters (2,228 feet) underground early
Sunday.
	   President Leonid Kuchma sent his condolences to the families of
the killed miners and decreed Monday a day of mourning throughout
Ukraine, the presidential press service said.
	   The government also allocated 792,000 hryvna (dlrs 396,000) to
compensate the victims' families.
	   Two similar accidents occurred at the 19th Communist Party
Congress mine in 1953 and 1957, in which 33 and 22 miners were
killed, respectively.
	   About 200 miners have already died this year in Ukraine's
deteriorating coal mines, many more than in the same period last
year.
	   The number of miners killed on the job has been steadily
increasing in recent years because mines lack the funds needed to
modernize equipment and improve safety conditions.
	   The worst single accident this year occurred in April, when a
methane blast killed 63 workers at a mine in the eastern region of
Donetsk.

Cambodian police deployed to prevent cheating on high school exams
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Hundreds of armed police were
deployed in front of high schools in Cambodia's capital Monday to
prevent rampant cheating on this year's final exams.
	   ``We requested the police forces to protect and prevent
cheating,'' said Oum Hoeung, the director of Phnom Penh
municipality's education department. ``We are determined to make
the exam cleaner this year.''
	   Exam cheating has become a blatant, almost accepted, annual
ritual in Cambodia in recent years.
	   More than 8,000 12th grade students began their exams Monday.
For those who want to go to the university, passing the test is
crucial.
	   Family and friends have been known to scale school walls to
deliver cheat sheets to the exam takers or to attach crib sheets to
rocks, throwing them in through opened windows.
	   Underpaid teachers and police turn a blind eye to the practice
in exchange for small bribes.
	   Several students' siblings tried to bribe their way onto the
school premises Monday in order to find out the exam questions and
work with friends and relatives on the outside to send the answers
back in. But only a few claimed success.

China condemns bombing in Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China on Monday condemned the weekend bombing in
Northern Ireland but urged all parties not to allow the violence to
derail the region's peace process.
	   ``We were shocked by the serious bombing on August 15,'' Foreign
Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said in a statement released by the
official Xinhua News Agency. ``The Chinese government opposes and
condemns all forms of terrorist acts.''
	   Zhu expressed the hope that Britain, Ireland and parties in
Northern Ireland will push ahead with an April peace agreement,
saying that ``an early and lasting peace ... will fully accord with
the best interests of all concerned.''
	   The car bombing in Omagh killed at least 28 people and injured
220. It has been widely blamed on renegade members of the Irish
Republican Army who rejected the peace agreement.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unidentified attackers fired a grenade launcher at
a government building in southern Russia, a news agency said
Monday.
	   Two shells crashed into the Russian Interior Ministry building
late Sunday night in the Kabardino-Balkaria region, 1,400
kilometers (900 miles) south of Moscow, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   No one was injured, and the damage to a criminal police chief's
office and a room occupied by duty officers was minimal, Interfax
said.
	   Kabardino-Balkaria borders the restive republic of Chechnya, and
has seen spillover violence following its neighbor's 1994-96
independence war against Russia.

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Shots were fired during demonstrations
outside the royal palace of this tiny mountain kingdom Monday, and
there were conflicting reports about casualties.
	   Khauhelo Raditapole, a spokeswoman for the opposition
Basotholand Congress Party, said police opened fire early in the
morning, killing a young man and a 16-year-old girl, the South
African Press Association reported.
	   At least 30 people were injured, the spokeswoman said.
	   The British ambassador, High Commissioner Peter Smith, disputed
the report. Reached by telephone from Johannesburg, Smith said
police trying to remove barricades shot anti-riot pellets when
demonstrators threw rocks at them. Three demonstrators were
slightly injured, he said.
	   In a later incident, protesters opened fire on officers,
wounding five, Smith said.
	   Government officials could not immediately be reached.
	   The opposition had called for a general strike in Maseru for
Monday, but Smith said it was only partially successful.
	   ``The town, apart from the problems this morning, is
surprisingly more normal than I thought it would be,'' Smith said.
	   Crowds have been gathering outside the palace and Parliament for
the past two weeks. Protesters charged that May elections returning
the Lesotho Congress for Democracy were rigged.
	   At least two people have died and four others were injured in
previous clashes between opposition groups and supporters of the
governing party.
	   Previously, security forces generally kept a low profile during
the unrest. Opposition demonstrators have been blocking off roads,
and many shops and offices closed their doors.
	   Lesotho, with a population of 2 million, is surrounded by South
Africa and frequently the site of unrest.

Chechen leader fires top prosecutor in effort to control restive

<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Chechnya's parliament has fired the
separatist republic's top law enforcement official in an effort to
clamp down on rising crime, the parliament press service said
Monday.
	   On recommendations from President Aslan Maskhadov, Chechnya's
parliament voted Prosecutor General Khavazk Serbiyev out of office
Sunday, citing ``poor and ineffective work,'' the press service
said.
	   Serbiyev was criticized for failing to find a culprit after an
assassination attempt on Maskhadov which injured him slightly but
killed two bodyguards.
	   The parliament also blamed Serbiyev for a fruitless
investigation into a June attack by gunmen on Chechnya's
government-controlled television station. That attack led Maskhadov
to declare a state of emergency in the mostly Muslim republic.
	   Chechnya has seen an increase in kidnappings, theft, and
violence among armed gangs, Muslim sects and ethnic groups since
its 1994-96 independence war with Russia. Maskhadov's efforts to
fight the outbursts have been mostly ineffective.
	   Despite his fight for independence, Russia considers Maskhadov a
moderate who is trying to rein in lawlessness and keep his
government essentially secular.

Russia's border chief travels to Tajikistan to inspect border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin ordered his border chief
to Tajikistan on Monday to ensure that the former Soviet Union's
southern borders are secure following recent Taliban victories in
Afghanistan.
	   Federal Border Service head Nikolai Bordyuzha will inspect posts
along Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan and meet local leaders
to discuss threats along the boundary, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   The former Soviet republics of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and
Turkmenistan, now part of the Commonwealth of Independent States,
fear a complete Taliban victory could send an influx of refugees
and weapons across their borders.
	   As part of CIS agreements, Russia keeps troops along the borders
of many former Soviet republics.
	   Yeltsin has said Russia will cooperate with the Central Asian
countries to ``raise a barrier to the Taliban'' by strengthening
those countries' borders with Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban have spread quickly through Afghanistan, imposing a
harsh version of Islamic law. Their recent victories in the north
knocked out major opposition strongholds and they now control more
than 85 percent of the country.
	   Russian officials have not ruled out military action if the
situation worsens.
	   ``We must be prepared to prevent and, if necessary, to country
the radical development of the situation in the region,'' Col. Gen.
Valery Manilov said Friday, according to the Interfax news agency.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Most U.S. Embassy personnel were
leaving Pakistan and other Americans were urged to join them Monday
after a suspect in the East African embassy bombings was caught in
Pakistan and turned over to Kenyan authorities.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland said all but about 50 of
the usual contingent of about 120 in the embassy in Islamabad and
consulates in Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar would leave under
security orders from the State Department. They and their families
will begin leaving Tuesday, he said.
	   ``American citizens currently in Pakistan are urged ... to
consider seriously departing Pakistan,'' the embassy added in a
statement. It noted airports were open and commercial flights
available, but added the embassy was arranging additional flights.
	   Figures on the numbers of Americans other than embassy staff in
Pakistan were not immediately available.
	   Hoagland refused to say whether a specific threat had prompted
the Pakistani warning. He also refused comment on the transfer
Pakistani officials reported Sunday of a suspect in the embassy
bombings. The nearly simultaneous explosions in Nairobi, Kenya and
Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on Aug. 7 killed a total of 257 people.
	   In a brief statement Sunday, Pakistani Foreign Ministry
spokesman Tariq Altaf said a man identified as Mohammad Sadik
Howaida arrived at the Karachi airport from Nairobi on Aug. 7.
Immigration officials suspected Howaida's Yemeni passport was
forged. Altaf said he was interrogated by Pakistani officials who
determined he had some link to the African bombings and handed him
over to Kenyan authorities.
	   The News, a national Pakistani newspaper, quoted unnamed
government sources Monday as saying Howaida claimed the attack was
sponsored by Osama bin Laden, a Saudi harbored in neighboring
Afghanistan who U.S. officials have identified as a possible
suspect in the bombings.
	   Bin Laden has been vocal in his hatred of what he sees as U.S.
imperialism and pledged to drive U.S. troops out of bases in places
like his native Saudi Arabia.
	   A spokesman for Afghanistan's Taliban militia told The
Associated Press Monday that the Saudi had nothing to do with the
bombings because he had pledged not to engage in such activities
while living under Taliban protection.
	   ``He cannot engage in any political, let alone military or
terrorist, activities,'' the spokesman, Abdul Hay Muttayn, said by
telephone from the southern Afghan city of Kandahar, where bin
Laden is believed to have a home.
	   The News said Howaida was a 34-year-old Palestinian engineer who
confessed to helping plan the bombings. He reportedly told
investigators six other conspirators slipped through the Karachi
airport Aug. 7 and on to Afghanistan.
	   A government source who insisted on anonymity had at first said
U.S. investigators had nothing to do with Howaida's interrogation
or the decision to send him to Kenya on Aug. 14.
	   But the source acknowledged Monday that Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif had called U.S. President Bill Clinton once a link between
Howaida and the bombings had been established, and U.S. Federal
Bureau of Investigation agents came to participate in the
questioning.
	   The official government statement on Howaida made no mention of
U.S. involvement. Pakistan's attempts hide U.S. involvement may
have been prompted by the case of Mir Aimal Kasi, the Pakistani
convicted of killing two CIA employees during a shooting spree in
Virginia in 1993.
	   When Kasi was arrested in Pakistan in June 1997 in a joint
FBI-Pakistani operation, angry Pakistanis accused their government
of groveling before U.S. power.
	   Americans in Pakistan have been advised to be on the alert since
last November, when four American oil workers were gunned down in
the southern port city of Karachi following Kasi's conviction. In
March, cement barricades were erected on the roads leading to the
high-walled U.S. Embassy compound in Islamabad.

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police arrested five people
Monday on suspicion of killing 28 men, women and children in the
little town of Omagh, whose residents struggled to come to grips
with its entry into the province's grim history books.
	   The five suspects were arrested at dawn in two villages north
and southeast of Omagh and taken to the main police interrogation
center in Belfast, 70 miles (110 kms) to the east, where under
British anti-terrorist law they can be held for up to a week before
being charged or released.
	   Each of the town's residents seemed to have a story to tell,
offered in flat tones of disbelief: A school chum who won't be in
class next month. A father and son who no longer will enliven a
neighborhood. A shopkeeper who never again will greet customers
with a ready smile.
	   ``I don't understand why I'm living,'' said Jim Sharkey, who was
knocked off his feet at his newsstand on bustling Market Street
when the 500-pound (200-kg) car bomb exploded Saturday in the worst
terrorist strike in Northern Ireland's history.
	   Three generations of one family are gone: Avril Monaghan, 30,
her 18-month-old daughter Maura and her mother Mary Grimes, 65, who
had been visiting from nearby towns to shop on Market Street. Mrs.
Monaghan was pregnant with twins.
	   Fernando Blasco, a 12-year-old boy from Madrid who was visiting
Ireland to learn English, died, as did Rocio Abad, the female
teacher twice his age. The two Spaniards had decided at the last
minute to put off visiting a historical park to do some shopping.
	   Also killed was 39-year-old Philomena Skelton, who had been
seeking a school uniform for her youngest daughter. Kevin Skelton
marveled that when he went to the morgue to formally identify his
wife of 20 years, she ``hadn't a mark on her face.''
	   ``How does this town deal with this?'' asked the Rev. Michael
Keaveny of Omagh's Sacred Heart Catholic Church, outside the
makeshift headquarters responsible for tracking the dead, the
approximately 220 wounded and the handful of people still listed as
missing.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair vowed Monday that he and his
Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, would work together to hunt down
the bombers _ believed to belong to a renegade Irish Republican
Army offshoot opposed to the April peace agreement.
	   ``We are only going to defeat them if we take the security
measures we can take, and make sure we are offering a different way
forward for the future,'' Blair said in a BBC radio interview.
	   On Sunday, U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed his condolences
to the people of Northern Ireland during a 15-minute telephone
conversation with Blair, who flew to Belfast on Sunday from his
vacation in southern France.
	   ``The prime minister briefed the president on his conversations
with the political leaders there today,'' White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said. ``I think the president and prime minister shared
how personally difficult it is to deal with these experiences as
leaders.''
	   Ronnie Flanagan, commander of Northern Ireland's police force,
planned to team up Monday with Pat Byrne, chief of the Irish
Republic's police, to assess security across the island. Their
recommendations will be forwarded to Blair and to Ahern, who has
not ruled out reintroduction of one of the most draconian responses
available to his government under emergency powers _ imprisoning
terrorist suspects without trial.
	   Blair said he, Ahern and their police chiefs would ``ensure we
bear down and crush out this dissident rump, insofar as it is
possible to do so.''
	   In east Belfast, meanwhile, a building in the British
government's center of administration for Northern Ireland was
evacuated after an anonymous caller warned that a bomb had been
abandoned in the parking lot outside. Police at the Stormont
complex reported finding no explosives.

Greece to buy four search and rescue helicopters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece Monday will sign a deal with the
French-German Eurocopter consortium to buy four search and rescue
helicopters.
	   The 18 billion drachma (dlrs 59.4 million) deal will be signed
by the Merchant Marine Ministry for the all-weather ``Super Puma''
helicopters. The ministry is responsible for the coast guard and
port police.
	   The helicopters will mostly be used for operations in the Aegean
Sea. Helicopters are often used for medical evacuations from the
hundreds of islands that speckle the sea, also a favorite
destination for hundreds of thousands of foreign vacationers every
summer.
	   Rescue operation are currently conducted by the military.

Palestinian police say they are close to catching detainee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police have detained a taxi driver
who gave a ride to a Hamas leader on the run and have new leads
about the whereabouts of the fugitive, the West Bank security chief
said Monday.
	   Imad Awadallah, a key figure in the Hamas military wing, escaped
Saturday from a Palestinian jail in the West Bank town of Jericho.
	   On Sunday, Palestinian security forces launched a massive
manhunt for Awadallah, conducting house-to-house searches in
Jericho and imposing a curfew.
	   The restrictions, which were not strictly enforced, were lifted
Monday after security officials said they were convinced Awadallah
was no longer in town.
	   ``All I can say is that he is not in Jericho,'' said Col. Jibril
Rajoub, head of the Palestinians' Preventive Security Service in
the West Bank. ``We will catch him.''
	   Rajoub said a taxi driver was detained after he gave Awadallah a
ride without recognizing him. ``Awadallah told the driver that he
needed to get to his father who had a stroke,'' Rajoub said.
	   Rajoub would not say where the driver took Awadallah.
	   Awadallah, 29, is a leading figure in Izzedine al Qassam, the
military wing of Hamas that has carried out more than a dozen
suicide bombings in Israel since 1994.
	   Awadallah was arrested by the Palestinian Authority in April and
accused of killing Hamas bombmaker Mohiyedin Sharif as part of an
internal dispute in the organization.
	   Israeli intelligence officials on Sunday Cabinet briefed
ministers on the escape and said there was suspicion that Awadallah
had inside help to escape.
	   Rajoub said a preliminary investigation of Awadallah's jail
break found that the duty officer had left the cell door unlocked.
However, Rajoub said he was certain the officer was negligent and
was not trying to help Awadallah escape. No charges will be brought
against the officer, Rajoub said.
	   ``No one from inside helped Awadallah escape, that is for
sure,'' Rajoub said.

Island authorities arrest Turks for raising Turkish flag in port
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KALYMNOS, Greece (AP) _ Six Turks, including a heart surgeon and
a Mercedes dealer, were arrested Monday after allegedly raising
their nation's flag on a lamp post during a local festival,
authorities said.
	   The charges were not immediately clear. But national symbols
evoke strong emotions on Aegean islands near the Turkish coast _ an
area where Turks have questioned Greek sovereignty over many of the
islets and rocky specks.
	   Two years ago, the hoisting of the Turkish flag on the nearby
eastern Aegean islet of Imia, known as Kardak in Turkish, almost
led Greece and Turkey to war.
	   The six Turks arrived on the island of Kalymnos aboard the
22-meter (72-foot) Turkish yacht Eda on Sunday during celebrations
of the island's honey production. One of the group, sailor Gunay
Zeybeker, allegedly raised the Turkish flag early Monday, the
merchant marine said.
	   Officials said the incident was photographed and filmed by
Cengiz Menteseoglu, a partner in a Mercedes dealership in Istanbul,
Turkey.
	   Greeks participating in the local festival nearby ``moved in a
threatening manner against them'' upon seeing the flag, the
ministry said.
	   The group fled on the yacht, but failed to obtain sailing
permission, officials said. The boat's captain, Sevket Gaykan, did
not board and was arrested by port authorities.
	   The Eda was intercepted by a Greek coast guard patrol boat. The
five Turks _ including Menteseoglu's wife Gonca; heart surgeon Dr.
Atilla Kayihan and his wife Leyla _ were led to the island of Kos,
about seven kilometers (four miles) from the Turkish mainland.
	   Court officials in Kos refused to comment on the proceedings.
	   Kalymnos Mayor Dimitris Diakomihalis called the flag raising ``a
very provocative act.''
	   ``These are not isolated actions in my opinion. They are actions
which send many messages,'' he added.
	   Diakomihalis had aroused controversy himself in 1996 by raising
the Greek flag on Imia just after the crisis.

UNITA attack on convoy reported in Angola
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ UNITA rebels attacked a Namibian convoy
carrying mine equipment, killing the driver and several others, the
Afrikaans newspaper Die Republikein reported Monday.
	   The convoy was ambushed near Malanje, 400 kilometers (250 miles)
east of the Angolan capital Luanda, it said.
	   The newspaper said Jekonia Kandetu, a driver for the Namibian
state-owned transport company Transnamib, was shot dead along with
an unknown number of Angolans. Two other Namibians were among the
injured in the attack Saturday, it said.
	   Angola, which borders Namibia in southwest Africa, has been
teetering on the brink of renewed civil war since late June, with
numerous clashes and deaths reported. Much of the fighting has been
taking place in the Malanje area, where mining is concentrated.
	   The army and rebels have been re-arming and actively recruiting
over the last three months as mutual distrust increasingly
undermined a peace agreement negotiated in Lusaka in 1994.
	   The U.N. Security Council last week voted to extend the Angola
peace-keeping operations until Sept. 15.

Myanmar issues veiled threat of violence against foreign activists

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Myanmar's military government issued a
veiled threat of violence Monday against any foreigners intent on
repeating the pro-democracy leafletting campaign carried out by 18
activists last week.
	   ``The Myanmar people want to live in peace and are angry with
the 18 foreigners,'' wrote Maung Pyi Tha, a pen name for a
government official, in a commentary in Monday's state-run New
Light of Myanmar newspaper.
	   ``The next time any destructionists or saboteurs try to disrupt
the country they will face not only the laws but the people who are
ready to prove their sense of duty,'' he wrote.
	   The same author wrote in a commentary on Saturday, that if he
had apprehended the activists he would have physically assaulted
them.
	   The activists _ six Americans, three Thais, three Indonesians,
three Malaysians, two Filipinos and an Australian _ were arrested
the day after the 10th anniversary of a failed nationwide democracy
uprising in Myanmar, also known as Burma, for handing out
pro-democracy leaflets.
	   On Friday, they were sentenced by a Myanmar court to five years
in prison with hard labor. The government deported them on
Saturday.
	   The Myanmar government said Monday it was distressed that the
U.S. government responded to the release by issuing a statement
saying basic human rights are not protected in Myanmar.
	   ``Bearing in mind the American activists avowed aim is to
overthrow the government of Myanmar, we wonder how the U.S.
government will deal with such foreign citizens,'' a Myanmar
government spokesman said.
	   Myanmar government officials frequently speak of
``annihilating,'' and ``crushing,'' the democratic opposition led
by 1991 Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   On Monday, Suu Kyi entered her sixth day of a stalemate with the
military over her right to meet members of her party outside
Yangon.
	   She and three colleagues were stopped in their van by the
authorities 32 kilometers (19 miles) outside the capital while
traveling to the city of Bassein.
	   The military is refusing to let them proceed, insisting there is
a threat of violence against her in Bassein.
	   The only physical attack on Suu Kyi came in Nov. 1996 by a mob
whose members said they were paid by the government.
	   This is the fourth time in two months Suu Kyi has been stopped
at the same roadblock. The government forcibly ended the last
incident by seizing Suu Kyi's car, forcibly restraining her and
driving her against her will back to Yangon.
	   Suu Kyi's party won 82 percent of the seats in parliament in a
1990 election the military refused to honor.
	   The NLD has set an Aug. 21 deadline for the government to
convene parliament.
	   On Monday, the Karen National Union, an ethnic insurgent group
fighting for autonomy from the military government, issued a
statement supporting the NLD's call for parliament to convene.
	   It called the military government's failure to allow the
congress to meet a ``criminal breach of trust,'' and denounced the
persecution of those elected.
	   Of the 385 NLD members elected in 1990, 181 have either been
imprisoned by the government, forced into exile, died or stripped
of their parliamentary status by the government.
	   The rest are living under harassment from the military, the NLD
has said.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets fell Monday, with the key
indexes in Malaysia and Thailand tumbling over 3 percent on news of
the devaluation of the Russian ruble. After weeks of financial
turmoil, Russia announced Monday that it would would permit the
value of the ruble to fall about 50 percent _ from about 6.3 to the
dollar to 9.5 to the dollar. Dealers said the devaluation of the
ruble raised fears that more currencies may follow suit and the
currency crisis, which started from Asia last July, would be
prolonged. Prime Minister Mahathir's remarks at a political rally
over the weekend that the Malaysian government intends to introduce
drastic measures to shore up the country's faltering economy also
dampened market sentiment. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After weeks of financial turmoil, Russia sharply
devalued the shaky national currency on Monday in a move expected
to cause hardship for Russian consumers and rattle international
markets. The Central Bank said it would permit the value of the
ruble to fall about 50 percent _ from about 6.3 to the dollar to
9.5 to the dollar. The currency market dipped only slightly in
early trading but the street price for dollars immediately plunged
to 9.5 rubles. President Boris Yeltsin interrupted his vacation and
headed to the Kremlin for a crisis meeting with his prime minister,
Sergei Kiriyenko. A ruble devaluation had been widely rumored, in
part because the government faces heavy payments on
ruble-denominated debt in coming days and weeks. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Seeking to soothe concerns about the nation's
banking system, Japan is willing to use public funds to help
Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. take over ailing Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan Ltd., a news report said Monday. The two banks had
announced a merger in June, but rumors that Sumitomo may be getting
cold feet as it learns the true extent of LTCB's bad loans have
sent LTCB's shares to record lows. The government has decided to
use funds originally earmarked for protecting depositors to ensure
that LTCB stays solvent as it merges with Sumitomo, the Yomiuri
newspaper said in its interactive edition. (JAPAN-TROUBLED BANK)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's finance minister called
Monday for transparency in the international financial system,
saying global players should adhere to the same rules they
advocate. Anwar Ibrahim, who is also deputy prime minister, said it
was ``lopsided'' to demand transparency and disclosure from poor
countries and not from wealthier economies. Malaysian leaders have
often blamed Western currency speculators for plotting to destroy
the Southeast Asian economy, once counted among the world's fastest
growing. (MALAYSIA-ANWAR)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Utilities prices in Phnom Penh are
expected to skyrocket next month, led by a 60 percent increase in
electricity rates, officials said Monday. The new power rates will
force other utilities companies to dramatically raise their prices,
said Mann Chhoeun, a city official. The Cambodia Daily newspaper
reported that water charges could be pushed 40 percent higher. The
price hikes, which were put off until after last month's
parliamentary elections for political reasons, have been blamed on
the drop in the value of Cambodia's currency and the rising price
of diesel oil. (CAMBODIA-UTILITIES)

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police arrested five suspects
Monday on suspicion of involvement of the Omagh bombing that killed
28 and wounded 220. An officer in the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said the five were arrested at
dawn in their homes near Omagh, 70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast.
Among those arrested, the officer said, is a relative of Omagh
politician Dessie Mackey, who earlier this year resigned from the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party over its decision to accept the Northern
Ireland peace agreement. The officer cautioned that charges against
any of the suspects was not imminent and under Northern Ireland
anti-terrorist law they could be interrogated for up to a week
before being charged or released. (NIRELAND-ARRESTS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces captured three more
villages in western Kosovo, pushing ethnic Albanian militants away
from the province's second-largest city, media reported Monday.
Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency said Serb police
``crushed'' important strongholds of the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army in the villages of Lodja, Grabovac and Rausic, all just
outside the province's second city of Pec. The push comes a day
after the Serbs gained control of the rebels' main logistical and
weapons distribution center, forcing the KLA to flee into the
surrounding hills and forests, abandoning weapons and ammunition.
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ With an army of rebel fighters closing in
on his capital, a defiant President Laurent Kabila said in a radio
broadcast Monday his government will arm the people and prevail.
The embattled president also lashed out at the international
community and accused the western nations of plotting against his
government. The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters,
Rwandan soldiers and disenchanted members of Kabila's military _
have been making steady progress toward the capital, a western
diplomat said. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The entourage of FBI agents grows in
Nairobi as more investigators try to learn whether the trail of
evidence from the deadly embassy bombing leads to at least one
suspect arrested abroad and returned to Kenya. Amid a flurry of
reports and other indications that the investigation was picking up
momentum, the FBI said it would issue a joint statement later
Monday. The Aug. 7 blasts in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
killed 257 people and injured more than 5,500. In the wake of
reports that a man had confessed to the bombing in Pakistan before
being flown back to Nairobi, a Kenyan newspaper reported Monday
that FBI agents had flown another suspect back following his arrest
in the United Arab Emirates. (EMBASSY BOMBINGS)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Soldiers piled sandbags in a rush Monday to build
up the last defense of China's largest oil field from the raging
waters of the Nen River. The river broke through two other dikes
protecting the oil field and Daqing, a northeastern city of 2.3
million people. The third embankment was the last chance to save
the oil field from a flood that would bring disastrous losses. To
the south, in central China, the Yangtze River reached a new record
height of 45.22 meters (149.2 feet) Monday morning at Shashi city,
home to a half million people. (CHINA-FLOODS)

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Fifty-four people died and 42 suffered
serious injuries in road accidents over a busy holiday weekend in
Spain, the government said Monday.
	   Highways were packed with people heading out on vacation or
returning from their holidays.
	   The congestion was compounded by motorists making trips to take
in street festivals held Saturday as towns all over Spain honored
their patron saints.
	   The worst single accident occurred in the central province of
Albacete when a car swerved off the road after one of its tires
burst. All five people in the car were killed, the National Traffic
Directorate said.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Amid signs their investigation is gaining
momentum, FBI agents intensified efforts Monday to learn whether
the trail of evidence from the twin embassy attacks in East Africa
leads to a Saudi multimillionaire fundamentalist.
	   The FBI confirmed Monday it is questioning a suspect returned to
Nairobi from Pakistan, but said he had not confessed or implicated
anyone else in the U.S. embassy bombings.
	   The Aug. 7 blasts in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed
257 people and injured more than 5,500.
	   Reports in Pakistan had said the suspect had confessed to
planning the bombings and implicated his co-conspirators.
	   ``Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, also known as Abdull Bast Awadh and
Mohammad Sadiq Howaida, has been returned to Kenya by Pakistani
authorities in the late evening of Aug. 14, 1998. He is currently
being questioned by CID officers and FBI special agents,'' said a
joint statement from Sheila Horan, the FBI special agent in charge
of the Nairobi investigation, and Peter Mbuvi, deputy director of
the Criminal Investigations Division of the Kenyan police.
	   ``Mr. Saddiq Odeh has not admitted any responsibility in the
bombings in Nairobi or Dar es Salaam, nor has he implicated anyone
else in those events,'' the brief statement concluded.
	   Meanwhile, a Kenyan newspaper reported Monday that FBI agents
had flown another suspect back following his arrest in the United
Arab Emirates.
	   The East African, citing airport sources, said the suspect is a
Pakistani national who was arrested in Dubai and flown to Nairobi
on Friday on a U.S. military plane. The report did not give the
suspect's name or specify his alleged role in the bombing.
	   A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Bill Barr, and
Kenyan police both declined comment Monday morning. A Pakistani
Embassy spokesman, Malik Ashraf, said he was unaware of the second
reported arrest.
	   In Pakistan on Monday, most U.S. Embassy personnel were leaving
and other Americans were urged to join them after the interrogation
and reported confession of Mohammad Sadik Howaida.
	   The U.S. State Department updated its ``worldwide caution'' for
Americans, warning specifically against all travel to Pakistan and
referring to ``subsequent threats,'' without elaborating.
	   The Pakistani national newspaper The News, quoting unnamed
government sources, said Sadik confessed during questioning in
Pakistan to planning the bombings and claimed the attack was
sponsored by Osama bin Laden.
	   U.S. officials have identified bin Laden, an exiled Saudi hiding
out in neighboring Afghanistan, as a possible suspect.
	   The News said Sadik is a 34-year-old Palestinian engineer. He
reportedly told investigators that six other conspirators slipped
through the Karachi airport Aug. 7 and apparently made it to
Afghanistan, where they had been told they would be congratulated
by bin Laden.
	   A Pakistani spokesman said Sadik was arrested on his arrival at
the Karachi airport from Nairobi on the day of the twin bombings.

Wahhabis in southern Russia declare independence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Islamic fundamentalists in three villages in
Russia's southern region of Dagestan have proclaimed themselves a
``separate Islamic territory'' and refuse to negotiate with
authorities, a news report said Monday.
	   Dagestani officials said that a police post nearest to the
villages of Karamakhi, Chabanmakhi and Kadar in central Dagestan
has come under fire from during the past few nights, the Interfax
new agency reported.
	   Members of the fundamentalist Wahhabi sect have also announced
plans to elect a religious government, saying it would be
independent from central authorities, Interfax reported.
	   Dagestan, which borders breakaway Chechnya, has been troubled by
spillover violence as well as its own conflicts. Dagestan's
Wahhabis have had several recent clashes with police who have tried
to disarm them.
	   Wahhabis in the three villages have set up a checkpoint on a
road to the region and refuse to negotiate with either the
government or religious leaders, said Dagestani Security Council
spokesman Eduard Urazayev, according to Interfax.
	   Dagestan's parliament and Cabinet plan to hold a joint emergency
session on Wednesday to discuss the situation.
	   Russian officials have blamed Wahhabis for recent violence in
several parts of the former Soviet Union.

Russia's border chief travels to Tajikistan to inspect border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new 4th graf with meeting planned between defense,
foreign ministers of four Central Asian nations. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin ordered his border chief
to Tajikistan on Monday to ensure that the former Soviet Union's
southern borders are secure following recent Taliban victories in
Afghanistan.
	   Federal Border Service head Nikolai Bordyuzha will inspect posts
along Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan and meet local leaders
to discuss threats along the boundary, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   The former Soviet republics of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and
Turkmenistan, now part of the Commonwealth of Independent States,
fear a complete Taliban victory could send an influx of refugees
and weapons across their borders.
	   The presidents of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, as well as of
nearby Kazakstan and Kyrgyzstan plan to organize a meeting between
their foreign and defense ministers to discuss ways of stepping up
security in the region, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   As part of CIS agreements, Russia keeps troops along the borders
of many former Soviet republics.
	   Yeltsin has said Russia will cooperate with the Central Asian
countries to ``raise a barrier to the Taliban'' by strengthening
those countries' borders with Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban have spread quickly through Afghanistan, imposing a
harsh version of Islamic law. Their recent victories in the north
knocked out major opposition strongholds and they now control more
than 85 percent of the country.
	   Russian officials have not ruled out military action if the
situation worsens.
	   ``We must be prepared to prevent and, if necessary, to country
the radical development of the situation in the region,'' Col. Gen.
Valery Manilov said Friday, according to the Interfax news agency.

of 1998 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Foreign investment in Ukraine totaled dlrs
517.7 million in the first half of 1998, up 54.3 percent from the
same period last year, a news report said Monday.
	   As of July 1, total foreign investment in Ukraine since the
nation became independent was dlrs 2.47 billion, the Interfax news
agency said, citing the State Statistics Committee.
	   Nearly one-fifth of that amount, dlrs 428.9 million, came from
the United States, followed by the Netherlands, Germany, South
Korea, Great Britain and Cyprus.
	   Ukraine, which became independent in 1991, has lagged behind
other former Soviet bloc nations in attracting foreign money as it
has been slow to implement structural reforms needed to attract
outside investors.

Defense ministers arrive to discuss Congo Kinshasa crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Defense ministers from Namibia and
Angola arrived here Monday for talks on the civil war in Congo, the
official news agency Ziana said.
	   ``There are no new developments yet, but the ministers want to
find a lasting solution to the crisis which seemingly is
deepening,'' a government official told Ziana.
	   The agency quoted ``government sources'' as saying they had
arrived for talks with their counterpart from Zimbabwe. A
representative of President Laurent Kabila's government had yet to
arrive.
	   Earlier reports had said foreign ministers of Namibia, Tanzania,
Zambia and Zimbabwe would gather here to report back on the peace
initiative launched earlier this month by the Southern African
Development Community.
	   However, Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge on Monday was
said to be in the Great Lakes region, studying Kabila's allegations
that Rwanda is backing the mutiny by fellow Tutsi ethnic group
soldiers.
	   Ziana quoted government sources that Monday's scheduled defense
ministers' meeting was a follow-up to the Victoria Falls summit
chaired by Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe.
	   Kabila met over the weekend with Namibia's President Sam Nujoma
and Angola's President Eduardo dos Santos in Luanda, repeating
requests for military assistance he made to Mugabe here in early
July, according to news reports.

Daimler, Shell working together on fuel-cell technology
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz said Monday it has hooked
up with Shell to expand fuel-cell technology for cleaner cars, the
latest in a series of joint ventures between oil and car companies.
	   Daimler has been working on fuel cells since 1992, which use
hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity to power a vehicle.
Daimler has been looking for a way to produce hydrogen on board so
that the cars wouldn't have to carry special tanks.
	   The Stuttgart-based automaker said Shell will bring to the
partnership a technology for extracting hydrogen from hydrocarbon
fuels such as gasoline and diesel, meaning electric-car drivers in
the future could fill up at regular gas stations.
	   Early this year, Ford Motor Co. formed a similar partnership
with Mobil Corp. and General Motors Corp. announced an arrangement
with Amoco Corp.
	   Daimler is also working with Ford and Canadian fuel-cell
developer Ballard Power Systems Inc. on developing fuel-cell
components for cars by 2004.

U.S. congressman calls for continued suspension of aid to Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A U.S. congressman said Monday he
would recommend the continued suspension of aid to Cambodia until a
``legitimate government'' is established.
	   In an Aug. 14 letter to King Norodom Sihanouk, Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher criticized last month's parliamentary elections won by
Cambodian leader Hun Sen's ruling political party as ``manipulative
shadow play.''
	   The United States should not continue aid to Cambodia ``until a
legitimate government, that is free of coercion, violence and
fundamental corruption is established,'' said Rohrabacher.
	   Rohrabacher, a California republican, authored an amendment to
the 1998 Foreign Operations section of the U.S. Appropriation Bill
that suspended U.S. funding to the Cambodian government after Hun
Sen ousted Prince Norodom Ranariddh as his co-premier in a violent
coup last year.
	   Hun Sen called for the new elections held July 26 to try to win
back legitimacy and aid lost after his July 1997 takeover. But
critics accuse the Cambodian strongman of rigging the process in
his own favor.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority of 64
seats in the polls, but not the two-thirds needed to form a new
government.
	   He has asked Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the Sam Rainsy
Party _ which together won 58 seats in the National Assembly _ to
join him in a coalition government. They have so far refused even
to recognize the polls which they said were marred with
irregularities.
	   Rohrabacher said he has ``strong support'' in Congress to
continue the suspension of aid to the Cambodian government for
1999.
	   That support ``will not be deterred by the bluster or
manipulation by dictators,'' he said.
	   While Cambodia is just a small nation, it ``now plays a pivotal
role to the struggle between freedom and tyranny worldwide,'' he
said.
	   Rohrabacher said that the world's perception of Cambodia's
elections would help determine the future of democracy in other
Asian countries, such as Burma, Indonesia and Vietnam.
	   Rohrabacher also told the king _ who has recommended a three-way
coalition between the CPP, FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party _
that he believes a coalition ``based on dishonesty and fear'' will
not save Cambodia ``but will ensure its destruction.''

A month after suspect's arrest, prosecution still does not have
</HEADLINE>
evidence &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE MWANGI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A month after a suspect was arrested in
connection with the murder a decade ago of British tourist Julie
Ward, the prosecution said Monday it needs at least two more weeks
to put a case together.
	   Prosecutor Stephen Munguti told the court he needed more time to
examine the evidence.
	   Simon ole Makallah, a senior warden in the Kenya Wildlife
Service, was arrested July 17. The following day Attorney General
Amos Wako said there was sufficient circumstantial evicence to
arraign the suspect and hold a second trial in the murder of the
28-year-old Ward, whose burned corpse was found in the Maasai Mara
National Reserve in September 1988.
	   Makallah has not yet been required to enter a plea although he
has been held in jail for a month.
	   Defense Attorney Karieko Tobiko objected to the request for more
time.
	   ``This is an old matter, the alleged offense took place more
than 10 years ago. There has been an inquest. There has been a
murder trial concerning this matter. There has been an
investigation by New Scotland Year,'' Tobiko said.
	   Magistrate Uniter Kidullah said she would rule Tuesday on the
prosecution's request for more time.
	   Tobiko told the court John Ward, the father of the victim, and
Wako told a press coference last month they were sure they had
finally found the man responsible for Miss Ward's death.
	   ``How can they turn around and tell us they are not ready to
proceed? If they are not ready, why are they ready to arrest the
suspect?'' Tobiko told The Associated Press after Monday's hearing.
	   Ward's mutilated and charred remains were discovered in the
reserve on the Tanzanian border Sept. 13, 1988. Officials first
claimed she had been attacked and killed by wild animals.
	   Two park rangers were subsequently arrested and tried for her
murder, but they were found innocent of all charges in June 1992.
Justice Fidahussein Abdullah criticized the police for conducting a
flawed investigation.
	   On March 2, 1996, Wako agreed that new information about the
killing made another ``fair and objective'' investigation
necessary.
	   Ward, a wealthy hotelier from Bury St. Edmunds, England, has
carried on a 10-year campaign to find his daughter's killers and
have them brought to justice.

Probe into Suharto's wealth to end in two months: attorney general
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An investigation into allegations that
Indonesia's ex-President Suharto amassed a fortune during his 32
years in power will be completed within two months, Attorney
General Andi Muhammad Ghalib said Monday.
	   Ghalib told reporters that his office had conducted about 70
percent of the investigation, the official Antara news agency said.
	   ``I think we can finish the job in another two months, I hope,''
he said.
	   Some critics have alleged that the former leader and his family
made billions of dollars from abusing their position and power.
	   Suharto has denied this along with allegations that he used a
string of charitable foundations to make money for himself.
	   Suharto resigned in May after Indonesia's worst economic crisis
in years triggered riots and protests against his authoritarian
regime.
	   President B.J. Habibie, a longtime friend of Suharto who
succeeded him as head of state, ordered the inquiry and has said
that the ex-leader would be held accountable under the law if any
wrongdoing was uncovered.
	   Ghalib said his office would make public its findings and had
been working intensively on the case. Even so, investigators still
needed to analyse bundles of documents.
	   Several weeks ago officials of the attorney general's office
said Suharto had promised to cooperate with their inquiries.
	   Suharto, 77, has rarely been seen in public since his departure
from office.
	   Habibie has also ordered the attorney general to investigate
wider claims of corruption under Suharto's regime.

Spanish planes leave for Northern Ireland to repatriate bombing
</HEADLINE>
victims
 &UR; With Northern Ireland

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A Spaniard who was wounded in a 1992 Basque
separatist attack left Monday for Northern Ireland to collect the
body of his 12-year-old son, killed in the Omagh car bombing.
	   Manuel Blasco was among 16 mourners who left from an air force
base outside Madrid aboard two military planes sent to Northern
Ireland by the Spanish government.
	   The Foreign Ministry said Saturday's bombing in Omagh killed two
Spaniards -- 12-year-old Fernando Blasco and 23-year-old Rocio Abad
-- and wounded 12 others.
	   The overall toll of the worst single terrorist attack in
Northern Ireland's history was 28 dead and 220 injured. Police
blamed a renegade offshoot of the Irish Republican Army.
	   The Spaniards were among a group of 28 youths who were studying
English just across the border in the Irish Republic and crossed
into Northern Ireland during a field trip. Abad was helping
supervise the group.
	   The air force said one of two CN-235 planes making the flight to
Northern Ireland was a hospital plane equipped with an intensive
care unit.
	   Doctors traveling aboard it will consult with colleagues in
Northern Ireland to determine which of the injured Spaniards can be
repatriated on Monday.
	   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said two were in critical
condition. Two others have already been released and the other
eight remain hospitalized.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Francisco Alvarez Cascos traveled
separately Monday to visit the wounded in hospitals in Belfast and
Londonderry and show solidarity with the people of Northern
Ireland.
	   Manuel Blasco, the father of the dead boy, has now been
victimized by both of Europe's last two armed movements. On June 9,
1992 he was driving by a Madrid supermarket when a car bomb
exploded, hitting him with shrapnel.
	   Ten military personnel and three other civilians were hurt in
that attack, blamed on the Basque extremist group ETA, which is
fighting for an independent Basque homeland in northern Spain.
	   The 12 Spaniards wounded in Omagh include Blasco's 14-year-old
daughter Lucrecia, who was wounded in the face and ear. Spanish
newspapers quoted relatives as saying she will have to undergo
plastic surgery.
	   Alvarez Cascos, speaking before leaving for Northern Ireland,
said: ``We must all think about how we can provide help in the face
of such a horrible drama: a family crushed twice by terrorism.''

Palestinian police say they are close to catching detainee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police have detained a taxi driver
who gave a ride to a Hamas leader on the run and have new leads
about the whereabouts of the fugitive, the West Bank security chief
said Monday.
	   Imad Awadallah, a key figure in the Hamas military wing, escaped
Saturday from a Palestinian jail in the West Bank town of Jericho.
	   On Sunday, Palestinian security forces launched a massive
manhunt for Awadallah, conducting house-to-house searches in
Jericho and imposing a curfew.
	   The restrictions, which were not strictly enforced, were lifted
Monday after security officials said they were convinced Awadallah
was no longer in town.
	   ``All I can say is that he is not in Jericho,'' said Col. Jibril
Rajoub, head of the Palestinians' Preventive Security Service in
the West Bank. ``We will catch him.''
	   Rajoub said a taxi driver was detained after he gave Awadallah a
ride without recognizing him. ``Awadallah told the driver that he
needed to get to his father who had a stroke,'' Rajoub said.
	   Rajoub would not say where the driver took Awadallah.
	   Awadallah, 29, is a leading figure in Izzedine al Qassam, the
military wing of Hamas that has carried out more than a dozen
suicide bombings in Israel since 1994.
	   Awadallah was arrested by the Palestinian Authority in April and
accused of killing Hamas bombmaker Mohiyedin Sharif as part of an
internal dispute in the organization.
	   Israeli intelligence officials on Sunday briefed Cabinet
ministers on the escape and said there was suspicion that Awadallah
had inside help.
	   Rajoub said a preliminary investigation of Awadallah's jail
break found that the duty officer had left the cell door unlocked.
However, Rajoub said he was certain the officer was negligent and
was not trying to help Awadallah escape. No charges will be brought
against the officer, Rajoub said.
	   ``No one from inside helped Awadallah escape, that is for
sure,'' Rajoub said.

Culminating months of financial turmoil, Russia devalues ruble
</HEADLINE>

meeting IMF official in graf 10. Edits to conform. Trims. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After weeks of financial turmoil, Russia sharply
devalued the shaky national currency on Monday in a move expected
to cause hardship for Russian consumers and rattle international
markets.
	   The Central Bank said it would permit the value of the ruble to
fall about 50 percent _ from about 6.3 to the dollar to 9.5 to the
dollar.
	   The currency market dipped only slightly in early trading but
the street price for dollars immediately jumped to 9.5 rubles.
	   President Boris Yeltsin, who had cut short his vacation and
returned to his country residence outside Moscow, met Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on Monday for a briefing, the Interfax
news agency reported, citing presidential spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky.
	   The government ``needed to take effective steps in the current
situation, and we have done that,'' Kiriyenko said before meeting
Yeltsin.
	   The two leaders had also met on Sunday _ along with Anatoly
Chubais, Yeltsin's envoy to international financial institutions _
to agree on the impending devaluation, Yastrzhembsky said.
	   A ruble devaluation had been widely rumored, in part because the
government faces heavy payments on ruble-denominated debt in coming
days and weeks.
	   ``The Russian leadership has taken these steps only after
exhausting other options,'' Chubais said. He blamed the situation
on the Asian crisis and a recent drop in world oil prices.
	   The government also forced a restructuring of short-term debts,
saying it would halt payment on government treasury bills and
impose a 90-day moratorium on payments of foreign debt.
	   Chubais, who conferred with IMF officials following the
announcement, insisted that the government was not defaulting.
	   ``We are not reneging on our debts,'' he said. ``We realize that
many of our partners will feel uncomfortable, but any hesitation on
our part would cost them far more.''
	   The devaluation is a tricky political move for the government.
It will sharply raise the prices of imports, which account for a
large percentage of Russian consumer goods, including more than
half the food sold in stores.
	   However, it was also expected to ease the government's budget
crunch, making it possible to pay months of wages and pensions owed
to Russians.
	   Government officials put the best spin on the situation. Central
Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin said the government action was ``aimed
at protecting Russian citizens and domestic producers.''
	   ``The government has decided to act in favor of them and against
traders in the hard currency and bond markets,'' he said, according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The price of the ruble dropped only slightly when the currency
market opened, slipping from 6.31 to 6.43 in early trading. The
stock market opened 45 minutes late, but after an initial drop the
index was up slightly _ 0.19 percent _ by midday.
	   Immediate public reaction to the devaluation was muted, with
some Russians approaching exchange booths only to turn back when
they saw the massive increase.
	   ``It was hard to survive before on my pension of 350 rubles a
month,'' said pensioner Yelena Bochet, 68. ``But now I simply don't
know what to do because all the prices will certainly soar.''
	   The devaluation was also expected to lead to the collapse of
many Russian commercial banks, which are over-dependent on
now-devalued ruble assets. The government and Central Bank said
they would pool the resources of leading banks to limit the damage.
	   They also proposed legislation to strengthen controls over
Russian financial markets in an effort to halt further capital
flight.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov denounced the devaluation as a
``full-scale bankruptcy'' of Yeltsin's government.

Sudanese rebel leader leaves Cairo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudanese rebel leader John Garang left Cairo
for Nairobi, Kenya, on Monday after attending a two-day meeting of
Sudanese dissident groups.
	   Garang, leader of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, left
before the National Democratic Alliance held a final ceremonial
session to close out its discussions, which were closed to the
press.
	   The Eritrea-based alliance of northern Sudanese politicians and
southern rebels opposed to the government, was expected to issue a
final statement after Monday's session.
	   In its Monday edition, the London-based Al-Hayat newspaper said
the rebels had agreed to continue their ``struggle against the
government of Khartoum to bring it down.''
	   Garang echoed that view in an interview with Associated Press
Television last week.
	   ``Our position ... is that this regime is a regime that should
be removed. It cannot be improved,'' Garang said.
	   The southern rebels took up arms in 1983 to demand more autonomy
for the Christian, animist south from the Muslim, Arab north. More
than 1.5 million people have died in the conflict and related
famines.
	   Sudan complained that Egypt's organizing of the meeting was a
boost to the opposition. But President Hosni Mubarak said in an
interview published Monday that he met with the rebels to try to
keep the neighboring nation unified.
	   ``This meeting was held in the interest of our brothers in
Sudan,'' he told the weekly newspaper Mayo of Egypt's ruling
National Democratic Party.
	   Egypt said earlier that it does not want the southern rebels to
gain an independent state since this would interfere with the pact
on sharing Nile River waters which flow through both countries.

Palestinian police say they are close to catching detainee

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police have detained a taxi driver
who gave a ride to a Hamas leader on the run and have new leads
about the whereabouts of the fugitive, the West Bank security chief
said Monday.
	   Imad Awadallah, a key figure in the Hamas military wing, escaped
Saturday from a Palestinian jail in the West Bank town of Jericho.
	   On Sunday, Palestinian security forces launched a massive
manhunt for Awadallah, conducting house-to-house searches in
Jericho and imposing a curfew.
	   The restrictions, which were not strictly enforced, were lifted
Monday after security officials said they were convinced Awadallah
was no longer in town.
	   ``All I can say is that he is not in Jericho,'' said Col. Jibril
Rajoub, head of the Palestinians' Preventive Security Service in
the West Bank. ``We will catch him.''
	   Rajoub said a taxi driver was detained after he gave Awadallah a
ride without recognizing him. ``Awadallah told the driver that he
needed to get to his father who had a stroke,'' Rajoub said.
	   Rajoub would not say where the driver took Awadallah.
	   Awadallah, 29, is a leading figure in Izzedine al Qassam, the
military wing of Hamas that has carried out more than a dozen
suicide bombings in Israel since 1994.
	   Awadallah was arrested by the Palestinian Authority in April and
accused of killing Hamas bombmaker Mohiyedin Sharif as part of an
internal dispute in the organization.
	   Israeli intelligence officials on Sunday briefed Cabinet
ministers on the escape and said there was suspicion that Awadallah
had inside help to escape.

Arguments end in trial of South African apartheid president Botha
</HEADLINE>

comment; trims &QL;

 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Lawyers for P. W. Botha contended
during closing arguments Monday that a legal summons from a body
probing apartheid atrocities was ``null and void'' and the case
against the former president should be dismissed.
	   Botha, 82, faces charges of ignoring a subpoeana from the Truth
and Reconciliation Commission. If convicted he faces up to two
years in jail or an unspecified fine.
	   On the last day of trial, defense lawyer Lappe Laubscher said
technical faults in the commission's decision to ask Botha to
testify meant the hard-line apartheid-era leader was under no
obligation to appear.
	   Laubscher said the summons had instructed him to appear before
the Truth Commission as a whole, whereas the hearing he was ordered
to attend was being held only by a sub-division of the panel.
	   ``He was subpoeanaed to appear before the TRC, not the Human
Rights Violation Committee. End of story,'' Laubscher said.
	   Botha claims the commission wants to humiliate him by forcing a
public appearence after he had supplied it with more than 1,700
pages of written answers to commission questions.
	   Laubscher repeated allegations that Botha and Truth Commission
chairman Desmond Tutu struck a deal in 1996 allowing Botha to give
written answers instead of oral testimony. Earlier in the trial
Tutu denied any such agreement.
	   Commission lawyers wanted to quiz Botha on the role of the State
Security Council, a shadowy security body he headed during the
1980s when a violent crackdown on anti-apartheid groups reached its
peak.
	   During his trial Botha's defense team has been confronted with
documents and witnesses who allege the council authorized the
killing of black liberation fighters.
	   Laubscher criticized the prosecution team for calling witnesses
to apartheid atrocities, saying such evidence was irrelevent.
	   Adjourning the case after the lawyers had finished their
arguments, Magistrate Victor Lugaju, who is black, said he would
deliver a verdict on Friday.
	   The long trial has cast light on the racial divisions still
plaguing South Africa, four years after all-race elections ended
apartheid and swept the African National Congress to power.
	   ANC Southern Cape organizer Lanvar Reid, who has monitored the
trial, said he was glad it was drawing to a close, but slammed
Botha for defying the commission.
	   ``The impression you get is that through his defiance he is
hiding something, protecting some people or covering up,'' he said.
	   Given Botha's age and frail health a fine is considered more
likely than a jail sentence, if he is found guilty.
	   As usual security was tight, with rolls of razor wire and armed
police ringing the court in George, a small coastal town about 240
miles (390 kilometers) east of Cape Town.

Iranian authorities seize 4.8 kilograms of heroin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Police seized 4.8 kilograms (10.5 pounds) of
heroin and arrested four men, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Monday.
	   It said the drugs were concealed in a vehicle in the central
Yazd province and two Afghans, a Pakistani and an Iranian were
arrested.
	   Large drug hauls are common in Iran, which lies along a route
used by smugglers in neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan to
transport drugs such as opium, hashish and heroin to Gulf Arab
states and beyond.
	   Drug smugglers face the death penalty under Iranian law.
Hundreds have been hanged since the law was passed nine years ago.

Drugs allegedly found inside man with forged Dutch passport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PROMAHONAS, Greece (AP) _ A man traveling on a forged Dutch
passport was arrested on the border with Bulgaria Monday after an
x-ray showed he had swallowed 12 condoms believed filled with
heroin.
	   Police and local media said the man was carrying a forged Dutch
passport in the name Gregory Edward, 27, when he was arrested by
customs officials on the border aboard a train headed from the
Bulgarian capital of Sofia to Athens.
	   ``He is not being cooperative. He is not giving us any
information,'' said Dimitris Inos, a regional police chief.
	   According to local medical examiner Minas Georgiades, the man
had swallowed 12 egg-shaped condoms containing 212 grams (7.5
ounces) of a substance believed to be heroin. Chemical tests were
being conducted.
	   Drug traffic across Bulgaria and other Balkan states has surged
after border regulations were eased following the collapse of the
Communist system in 1989.
	   Customs officials at Bulgaria's Black Sea port of Varna seized
670 kilograms (1,474 pounds) of cocaine loaded in a cargo container
last Friday. Greek customers officers on the same day arrested two
Albanians on the border with Turkey after finding 26 kilograms (57
pounds) of heroin in their car.

Sudanese rebel leader leaves Cairo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudanese rebel leader John Garang left Cairo
for Nairobi, Kenya, on Monday after attending a two-day meeting of
Sudanese dissident groups.
	   Garang, leader of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, left
before the National Democratic Alliance held a final ceremonial
session to close out its discussions, which were closed to the
press.
	   The Eritrea-based alliance of northern Sudanese politicians and
southern rebels opposed to the government, was expected to issue a
final statement after Monday's session.
	   In its Monday edition, the London-based Al-Hayat newspaper said
the rebels had agreed to continue their ``struggle against the
government of Khartoum to bring it down.''
	   Garang echoed that view in an interview with Associated Press
Television last week.
	   ``Our position ... is that this regime is a regime that should
be removed. It cannot be improved,'' Garang said.
	   The southern rebels took up arms in 1983 to demand more autonomy
for the Christian, animist south from the Muslim, Arab north. More
than 1.5 million people have died in the conflict and related
famines.
	   Sudan complained that Egypt's organizing of the meeting was a
boost to the opposition. But President Hosni Mubarak said in an
interview published Monday that he met with the rebels to try to
keep the neighboring nation unified.
	   ``This meeting was held in the interest of our brothers in
Sudan,'' he told the weekly newspaper Mayo of Egypt's ruling
National Democratic Party.
	   Egypt said earlier that it does not want the southern rebels to
gain an independent state since this could affect a pact on sharing
Nile River waters.

Iraqi refugees arrive in Iran from Saudi Arabia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A group of Iraqi refugees has arrived in
Iran after spending the last six years in a camp in Saudi Arabia,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported Monday.
	   The 55 Shiite Muslim Iraqis, who were part of 33,000 refugees
living in the Rafha camp in Saudi Arabia following the 1991 Gulf
War, arrived in Iran on Sunday night to settle in Iran, the agency
said.
	   They had sent several letters to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei asking for permission to live as refugees in Iran, it
said.
	   An official at the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in the
Saudi capital Riyadh said Saudi Arabia paid for the refugees'
flight. It gave 1,000 riyals (dlrs 266) to children under 2 years
and 3,000 riyals (dlrs 800) to others to help them in their
transition.
	   A total of 3,500 Iraqis are expected to live in the Ibrahimabad
refugee camp in the central city of Arak, Iran's news agency
reported.
	   The refugees coming to Iran have relatives in the country and
more will arrive in the next few days, said Aziz Ahmed, acting
representative of the UNHCR in Riyadh.
	   The 33,000 Iraqis held at Rafha camp on the Saudi-Iraq border
were either defectors from the Iraqi army or were taken prisoner by
the U.S.-led coalition forces and refused to return to Iraq after
the war.
	   Most have resettled in the United States, Australia and some
European countries. Ahmed said the Rafha camp remain open until the
remaining 5,600 refugees find homes in other countries.

	   Fossett still had to cross a huge stretch of the Pacific Ocean
between Australia and Argentina and had at least another five days
of travel before he was expected to reach South America. He took
off from Argentina on Aug. 7.
	   Fossett, from Chicago, was making his fourth attempt to fly
around the world. He has also run marathons, climbed mountains and
raced in the Iditarod dog sled race in Alaska.
	   A French military plane dropped a 15-man life raft to Fossett at
about 8:40 a.m. (2240 GMT Sunday) Monday, after reaching the site
near the Chesterfield islands, about 500 miles (800 km) off
Australia's east coast, said the French navy in Noumea, New
Caledonia.
	   The French plane circled Fossett until its fuel began to run
low, then headed back to its home base in Noumea, Poke said.
	   Darren Curtis from The TV 7 Network in Australia, who was aboard
the Australian Hercules C-130, talked to Fossett via the plane's
radio.
	   ``He said he was caught in a giant thunderstorm with hail and
lightning which actually ruptured his balloon. He fell 29,000 feet
(8,840 meters) into the ocean,'' Curtis said.
	   ``He says when he hit the ocean his balloon capsule caught fire
and he had to evacuate into a tiny life raft,'' Curtis said,
	   Seas in the area were relatively calm but authorities were
concerned because the area is littered with coral reefs which may
be full of sharks, are hard to detect by radar and dangerous to
even the largest vessels.
	   Fossett was equipped with a wet suit and life raft, and the
capsule of the balloon was seaworthy, but not leakproof.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The schooner Atlanta picked up American
millionaire-adventurer Steve Fossett on Monday from the Coral Sea,
where he landed when his balloon went down in a storm during his
around-the-world attempt, authorities said.
	   Fossett was safe aboard the 60-foot (18 meter) Atlanta and was
expected to be taken aboard the New Zealand navy tanker The
Endeavor within the next couple of hours, New Zealand Defense Force
spokesman Bill Morley said.
	   He was to be taken to Townsville, Queensland, Australia, said
Judy Jasper, a spokeswoman at Fossett's headquarters at Washington
University in St. Louis.
	   He gave a thumbs-up to his rescuers and said he was fine hours
after lightning struck his balloon and he crashed into the sea,
authorities said.
	   Fossett has been in regular radio contact with a Royal
Australian Air Force Hercules C-130 since about lunchtime Monday,
when a rescue plane from Sydney reached the balloon crash site east
of Australia.
	   Fossett still had to cross a huge stretch of the Pacific Ocean
between Australia and Argentina and had at least another five days
of travel before he was expected to reach South America. He took
off from Argentina on Aug. 7.
	   Fossett, from Chicago, was making his fourth attempt to fly
around the world. He has also run marathons, climbed mountains and
raced in the Iditarod dog sled race in Alaska.
	   A French military plane dropped a 15-man life raft to Fossett at
about 8:40 a.m. (2240 GMT Sunday) Monday, after reaching the site
near the Chesterfield islands, about 500 miles (800 km) off
Australia's east coast, said the French navy in Noumea, New
Caledonia.
	   The French plane circled Fossett until its fuel began to run
low, then headed back to its home base in Noumea, Poke said.
	   Darren Curtis from The TV 7 Network in Australia, who was aboard
the Australian Hercules C-130, talked to Fossett via the plane's
radio.
	   ``He said he was caught in a giant thunderstorm with hail and
lightning which actually ruptured his balloon. He fell 29,000 feet
(8,840 meters) into the ocean,'' Curtis said. ``He says whenard to detect by radar and dangerous to
even the largest vessels.
	   Fossett was equipped with a wet suit and life raft, and the
capsule of the balloon was seaworthy, but not leakproof.

Hong Kong monetary chief defends market intervention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Hong Kong officials ``agonized'' before
intervening in stock and futures exchanges, but the monetary chief
said Monday the drastic decision was necessary _ and might be
repeated _ to stop speculators from manipulating the markets.
	   The intervention on Friday pushed the battered Hang Seng Index
up by 8.5 percent, but critics have contended the move could
undermine confidence in Hong Kong as a free market.
	   The chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Joseph
Yam, said in a letter to the daily Financial Times that officials
stand by their action and that if necessary they will intervene
again ``to deter currency manipulators.''
	   Hong Kong officials contend that speculators are selling off
stocks they don't own in hopes of seeing the price drop _ then
manipulating the market by selling Hong Kong dollars and forcing
officials to raise interest rates. That, in turn, has helped push
stocks lower.
	   ``We do object to people manipulating our currency to engineer
extreme conditions in the interbank market and high interest rates
to make profits in the short positions in stock index futures,''
Yam wrote. ``We have reason to believe there has been such
manipulation.''
	   He said traders have been further upsetting markets by spreading
``malicious rumors of all sorts.''
	   Yam said Hong Kong officials have no objections to people
betting that the Hong Kong stock market will go down, as long as
they don't try to manipulate prices by selling off the currency,
too.
	   Hong Kong pegs its dollar at a stable rate against the U.S.
dollar _ and it has held steady over the past year as many other
Asian currencies saw sharp devaluations amid the region's severe
economic crisis.
	   As speculators have mounted an assault on the Kong Kong dollar,
Hong Kong monetary authorities have been forced to raise interest
rates to defend their link with the U.S. dollar.
	   ``To deter currency manipulation, we took action to tackle the
matter at source, and that meant making sure that those engaging in
this activity lose money,'' Yam wrote. ``We realize that this might
be seen as a departure from our free-market philosophy. That is why
we agonized before this difficult decision was taken. But we feel
we have done the right thing.''
	   Yam said Hong Kong officials will stop intervening and let stock
prices find their own levels _ as soon as the currency manipulation
stops.
	   ``But meantime we shall act to deter currency manipulation,'' he
wrote.
	   Hong Kong markets were closed on Monday for a holiday
commemorating the end of Japanese occupation in World War II.

Legislator says police driving in style
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ In the latest blow to Taiwan's
scandal-tainted police force, a legislator said Monday that
hundreds of police officers drive luxury cars allegedly obtained
through payoffs from illegal businesses.
	   Of the island's approximately 80,000 policemen, 767 drive
Mercedes Benz sedans, and luxury BMWs are even more popular, said
Shyu Jong-shyong, a ruling Nationalist Party legislator who
commissioned a survey of policemen's personal vehicles.
	   Those cars are priced well beyond the financial means of most
officers, Shyu told a news conference.
	   ``Given a policeman's salary it would take them 5-6 years to pay
for them, and that's only if they didn't eat, drink or make spend
money on anything else,'' Shyu said.
	   Shyu said that the more illegal businesses there are in an area,
the more likely policemen are to be found driving luxury cars. That
reinforces suspicions that officers are accepting payoffs in
exchange for protection, he said.
	   Police officials said many officers buy their cars second hand
and ownership doesn't connote wrongdoing.
	   But the revelations come at a bad time for the force.
	   A former director of the police academy was arrested last week
on suspicion of accepting millions of dollars in bribes to rig
examination results for would-be cadets.
	   Kuo Chen-yuan may have accepted up to 25 million Taiwan dollars
(U.S. dlrs 714,000) from applicants, investigators say.
	   Taiwan's police have been undergoing a painful transition from
an instrument of repression during the 1949-1987 martial law regime
to a modern force for policing and solving crimes.
	   But as with Taiwan's government, corruption is believed to be
widespread, and officers are sometimes referred to as ``gangsters
in uniform.''

Prosecutor investigating doping interrogates former Juventus star

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Former Juventus star Gianluca Vialli on
Monday met with a prosecutor looking into allegations that he and
other players in Italy's top division soccer league took
performance-enhancing substances.
	   Vialli, now player-coach of English club Chelsea, was summoned
after AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman told Italian media he was amazed
by the quick muscular development of players including Vialli and
Alessandro Del Piero, a star-forward for Juventus.
	   Vialli walked past reporters without commenting following a 2
1/2-hour session with Turin prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello. He has
hotly denied taking illegal substances, calling the prosecutor a
``terrorist trying to destabilize the soccer world.''
	   During questioning Friday, Del Piero told Guariniello his
strength was the result of ``years of hard work.''
	   The prosecutor, who has been investigating doping in sports for
years, met with Zemen last week. The Czech coach stuck to his
allegations, but did not say which banned drugs the players
allegedly use.
	   Vialli, Del Piero and Juventus have all announced that they are
suing Zeman for libel.
	   In Bologna Monday, prosecutor Giovanni Spinosa interrogated
Italy's national soccer team doctor Paolo Zeppilli. The prosecutor
heard World Cup stars Dino Baggio and Enrico Chiesa last week.

Government officials give mixed messages about ``bridge bank''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Top Japanese finance officials gave conflicting
signals Monday about whether the government's proposed ``bridge
bank'' system would be used if a major bank were to collapse.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is trying to set up a
government-run bank that would take over insolvent banks and run
them for up to five years while bad loans and remaining assets are
sold.
	   The Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami said that pre-emptive
measures to prevent collapses such as arranging mergers would be
better than using the bridge bank to mop up bad debts at big banks
that fail.
	   ``First we need to know the situation (for the bank in question)
as soon as we can,'' said Hayami. ``Instead of using the bridge
bank, it is preferable that a merger takes place.''
	   ``A collapse of a major bank would cause turmoil in financial
markets and other economic activities,'' Hayami added.
	   But Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government is
willing to use the bridge bank scheme regardless of the size of the
bank.
	   ``It does not matter if the bank is big or small,'' Miyazawa
said. ``It is possible to use the system no matter what size the
bank is.''
	   Meanwhile, a Cabinet spokesman told reporters that Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi wanted the ``bridge bank,'' which would be
funded by up to 11 trillion yen (dlrs 76 billion) in public funds,
approved by early October.
	   ``The best scenario is to have the debate completed at both
houses of Parliament... by early October,'' said Deputy Cabinet
Spokesman Akitaka Saiki.
	   But swift approval for the bills could prove difficult. They
have come under harsh criticism from opposition parties which could
block the bills in the upper house of Parliament, where the LDP has
a minority of seats.
	   The ruling party's rivals, led by the main opposition Democratic
Party, say that the use of public funds to take over the assets of
shaky banks would be too soft on bank managers who allowed the bad
loan to pile up.
	   Last week, three main opposition parties _ Liberal, Democratic
and the Peace and Reform parties _ agreed on a tentative plan to
submit banking bills as an alternative to LDP's ``bridge bank''
bills.

Culminating months of financial turmoil, Russia devalues ruble

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After weeks of financial turmoil, Russia sharply
devalued the shaky national currency on Monday in a move expected
to cause hardship for Russian consumers and rattle international
markets.
	   The Central Bank said it would permit the value of the ruble to
fall about 50 percent _ from about 6.3 to the dollar to 9.5 to the
dollar.
	   The currency market dipped only slightly in early trading but
the street price for dollars immediately jumped as high as 9.5
rubles.
	   President Boris Yeltsin, who had cut short his vacation and
returned to his country residence outside Moscow, met Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on Monday for a briefing, the Interfax
news agency reported, citing presidential spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky.
	   The government ``needed to take effective steps in the current
situation, and we have done that,'' Kiriyenko said before meeting
Yeltsin.
	   The two leaders had also met on Sunday _ along with Anatoly
Chubais, Yeltsin's envoy to international financial institutions _
to agree on the impending devaluation, Yastrzhembsky said.
	   A ruble devaluation had been widely rumored, in part because the
government faces heavy payments on ruble-denominated debt in coming
days and weeks.
	   ``The Russian leadership has taken these steps only after
exhausting other options,'' Chubais said. He blamed the situation
on the Asian crisis and a recent drop in world oil prices.
	   The government also forced a restructuring of short-term debts,
saying it would halt payment on government treasury bills and
impose a 90-day moratorium on payments of foreign debt.
	   Chubais, who conferred with IMF officials following the
announcement, insisted that the government was not defaulting.
	   ``We are not reneging on our debts,'' he said. ``We realize that
many of our partners will feel uncomfortable, but any hesitation on
our part would cost them far more.''
	   Chubais said the IMF team, led by John Odling-Smee, was
supportive of the government's action and promised to release
another disbursement of the promised aid package next month.
	   The devaluation is a tricky political move for the government.
It will sharply raise the prices of imports, which account for a
large percentage of Russian consumer goods, including more than
half the food sold in stores.
	   However, it was also expected to ease the government's budget
crunch, making it possible to pay months of wages and pensions owed
to Russians.
	   Government officials put the best spin on the situation. Central
Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin said the government action was ``aimed
at protecting Russian citizens and domestic producers.''
	   ``The government has decided to act in favor of them and against
traders in the hard currency and bond markets,'' he said, according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The price of the ruble dropped only slightly when the currency
market opened, slipping from 6.31 to 6.43 in early trading. The
stock market opened 45 minutes late, but after an initial drop the
index was up slightly _ 0.19 percent _ by midday.
	   Immediate public reaction to the devaluation was muted, with
some Russians approaching exchange booths only to turn back when
they saw the massive increase.
	   ``It was hard to survive before on my pension of 350 rubles a
month,'' said pensioner Yelena Bochet, 68. ``But now I simply don't
know what to do because all the prices will certainly soar.''
	   The devaluation was also expected to lead to the collapse of
many Russian commercial banks, which are over-dependent on
now-devalued ruble assets. The government and Central Bank said
they would pool the resources of leading banks to limit the damage.
	   They also proposed legislation to strengthen controls over
Russian financial markets in an effort to halt further capital
flight.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov denounced the devaluation as a
``full-scale bankruptcy'' of Yeltsin's government.
	   Yeltsin's economic advisor Alexander Livshits submitted his
resignation on Monday, saying he accepts part of responsibility for
the crisis. Several other top officials were also rumored to be in
line for resignation.

Mubarak: Justice is guarantee against terrorism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak condemned the
bombings of the U.S. embassies in East Africa and said that justice
was the only guarantee against terrorism, Egyptian newspapers
reported Monday.
	   It was the president's first public comments on the explosions
in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, that killed 257
people and injured more than 5,500. Among the dead were 12
Americans.
	   ``Justice is the real guarantee against terrorism because
feelings of injustice leads to a state of boiling that cannot be
controlled, which then lead to desperate acts,'' the
Arabic-language Mayo quoted Mubarak as saying.
	   Mubarak did not elaborate, but he appeared to be speaking about
justice for the Arabs.
	   The Arabs have widely criticized U.S. policies in the Middle
East, accusing the Clinton administration of failing to pressure
Israel to follow through on peace deals with the Palestinians and
seriously damaging the peace process.
	   There also has been criticism of U.N. sanctions on Libya, Iraq
and Sudan which have caused economic hardship for the people of
those countries.
	   Mubarak added that acts of violence ``will not solve problems or
reach an objective except bloodletting.''
	   After the explosions, Mubarak dispatched a ton of medical
supplies and 15 top doctors Kenya to help the victims of the
embassy bombing there.

Taiwan official calls for respect of flags in China exchanges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Media reports of Chinese visitors
insulting Taiwan's flag sparked demands Monday that symbols of
state be respected during organized exchanges between the two
rivals.
	   Meanwhile, a top official said private visits between the sides
should be more tightly regulated to prevent Chinese attempts to
foster discord by taking advantage of Taiwan's open society.
	   Flags and national symbols must be respected during exchanges,
regardless of who is playing host, said Shi Hwei-yow, secretary
general of the semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation and
Taiwan's chief negotiator with China.
	   He said further investigations were being conducted into reports
that Chinese official Li Yafei demanded Taiwanese flags be removed
from meeting rooms and refused to accept souvenir gifts bearing
Taiwan's official name and symbols of state during a recent visit.
	   Taiwan considers such behavior indicative of the haughty
attitude Beijing adopts towards the island it considers a renegade
province.
	   New regulations will deal with such incidents by forcing host
organizations to immediately cut short the visits of their Chinese
guests and prosecute Taiwanese who comply with such demands.
	   Taiwanese media have reported numerous instances of Chinese
visitors leaving in a huff after spotting Taiwan's red, white and
blue flag. A children's choir from China earlier this year canceled
a performance in central Taichung city after spotting a Taiwanese
flag displayed in the room.
	   Taiwan's ruling Nationalists were driven out of China by Mao
Tse-tung's communists in 1949, but retain many of the political
trappings of the mainland regime, along with its official title,
the Republic of China.
	   Private exchanges between the sides began in the early 1980s,
and have continued despite a more than three-year freeze in talks
between their negotiating bodies.
	   But those exchanges need to be more tightly regulated to check
China's attempts to ``break apart Taiwan from the inside,''
foundation Deputy Secretary General Wu Hsin-hsing was quoted saying
by the China Times newspaper.
	   Beijing uses Taiwan's democratic system, that allows advocacy of
both formal independence and reunification with China, to further
its agenda here, Wu was quoted as saying by the paper.

Book closing on case involving East German secret police; opened in

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Prosecutors plan to drop all remaining charges
against the former head of the East German secret police because of
the defendant's poor health, Berlin's Justice Ministry said Monday.
	   ``He is permanently unfit for trial,'' said spokeswoman Michaela
Blume. ``The files will be closed shortly.''
	   Prosecutors have sought to try Erich Mielke on charges related
to deaths at the Berlin Wall, but he has avoided prosecution
because of poor health and senility. Now 90, he lives in seclusion
with his wife in an apartment in eastern Berlin.
	   Mielke, a life-long communist, was tried and convicted in 1993
for the murders of two Berlin police officers in 1931. Mielke fled
prosecution after the deaths, returning to East Germany only after
it became a communist state.
	   He was sentenced to six years in prison, and was released in
1995 after serving two-thirds of the sentence.
	   Meanwhile, a leader of the successor party to the East German
communists asked Berlin prosecutors Monday to investigate his past.
	   Gregor Gysi, who now is parliamentary leader for the Party for
Democratic Socialism, hopes to clear himself of allegations he was
a secret police informer in the 1970s and '80s, said party
spokesman Juergen Reents.
	   A parliamentary panel report, issued in May after a three-year
probe, found Gysi informed on dissidents he represented as a lawyer
in former East Berlin from 1975 until at least 1986.
	   He has denied the allegations and called the report politically
motivated. But he lost a bid in July before the Constitutional
Court to quash it.
	   That ruling could open the way for parliament to lift Gysi's
immunity from prosecution if prosecutors decide there is enough
evidence to open a criminal probe.

Bomb explodes, injures 16 in Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ A bomb concealed on a motorbike
exploded in a Tamil city in eastern Sri Lanka Monday, injuring 16
people and partly damaging a bank and two shops, police said.
	   The bomb went off around midday in front of the privately-owned
Seylan Bank at Batticaloa, a provincial capital on the east coast,
said a police officer reached by telephone.
	   ``The explosives were packed in a motor cycle and it exploded
with a huge bang,'' said the officer, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Batticaloa, 220 kilometers (135 miles) east of Colombo, is a
government-controlled down with a Tamil majority. It has been long
contested by Tamil rebels.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but the military
blamed it on Tamil Tiger rebels.
	   On Sunday, a suspected Tamil militant in the central town of
Kandy swallowed a cyanide capsule moments before the security
forces burst in and found a huge cache of high explosives. A second
alleged courier was captured alive, police said.
	   Police suspect the explosives have been brought from Batticaloa.
	   Acting on an intelligence tip, a joint team from the police and
the army seized 110 kilograms (235 pounds) of explosives in the
raid on a house in Kandy, said Nimal Medivaka, the senior
superintendent of police.
	   They arrested the second person in the house, 90 kilometers (55
miles) east of Colombo.
	   Suicide by consuming cyanide is a trademark of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam which is fighting for an independent homeland
for minority Tamils.
	   Some officials said the Tigers might be targeting a new air
force base recently built near Kandy.
	   While most of Sri Lanka's Tamils live in the north and east, the
tea-growing areas of Kandy also have a sizable number of Tamil
workers.
	   In January, the Tigers rammed a bomb-rigged truck into the
country's holiest Buddhist shrine, said to house a tooth of Buddha.
The attack killed 18 people and wounded another 12.
	   Also on Sunday, police defused a bomb near a telecommunication
facility at Eravur near Batticaloa, with enough explosive power to
disrupt telephone services in the city.
	   The Tamils, who make up for 18 percent of Sri Lanka's population
of 18. 5 million, accuse the majority Sinhalese of widespread
discrimination in education and jobs. More than 54,000 people have
been killed since the war began in 1983.

Russians flabbergasted by ruble's plunge, blame the government

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yelena Bochet's eyes opened wide behind her thick
glasses as she read the figures posted at a currency exchange booth
where the Russian ruble just plunged 50 percent against the dollar.
	   ``I already can afford little more than a loaf of bread and a
pack of milk on my pension of 350 rubles a month,'' the 68-year-old
pensioner said, her wrinkled face overcome with emotion. ``I don't
know how I will get by now when all the prices will soar.''
	   Russia's government announced the ruble devaluation Monday after
trying to hold off for months, fearing just the kind of reaction
visible outside the booth on Moscow's Novy Arbat street.
	   A small crowd gathered, gazing at the new rate posted there _
9.5 rubles to the dollar _ and fuming at the government and
President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``Yeltsin promised the other day there would be no devaluation.
He cheated us again,'' Bochet said quietly.
	   Others were more outspoken.
	   ``This is where Yeltsin's policy has brought us _ to complete
collapse,'' said a 64-year old pensioner who identified according
to Russian tradition by his first and middle names, Ivan
Semyonovich.
	   ``Yeltsin followed your American guidance and brought the
country to ruin,'' he sputtered.
	   The devaluation is expected to sharply raise consumer prices,
especially on imports. But there was little sign of panic buying on
Monday, and price tags in retail shops were unchanged.
	   ``The prices will remain stable for a couple of weeks while
stores are selling their current supplies,'' said Andrei Belyayev,
a 36-year old owner of a food import business. ``You'll see the
effect next month.''
	   Vladimir Kirillov, a manager at an electronics store, said
business continued as usual Monday as the store continued its
summer clearance. ``There is no sign of panic buying,'' he said.
	   At banks and exchange booths, business ground to a halt as
virtually no clients were willing to buy dollars at the new price.
Those who wanted to sell foreign currency were also hesitant since
banks' purchase prices remained at 6.4 rubles to the dollar.
	   ``I will wait for more realistic rate before I sell any
dollars,'' said Dmitry Romanenkov, a 36-year-old businessman.
	   Since 1992, when Russia launched its chaotic free-market
reforms, many Russians have kept their savings in dollars, and
banks did not report a run on deposits.
	   Even Ivan Semyonovich said he now keeps his savings in a dollar
account. But that didn't ease his anger.
	   ``In Soviet times, we had the sense of confidence in the
future,'' he said. ``And now Yeltsin, and you Americans, have
stolen it from us.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police have detained a taxi driver
who gave a ride to a Hamas leader on the run and have new leads
about the whereabouts of the fugitive, the West Bank security chief
said Monday.
	   Imad Awadallah, a key figure in the Hamas military wing, escaped
Saturday from a Palestinian jail in the West Bank town of Jericho.
	   On Sunday, Palestinian security forces launched a massive
manhunt for Awadallah, conducting house-to-house searches in
Jericho and imposing a curfew.
	   The restrictions, which were not strictly enforced, were lifted
Monday after security officials said they were convinced Awadallah
was no longer in town.
	   ``All I can say is that he is not in Jericho,'' said Col. Jibril
Rajoub, head of the Palestinians' Preventive Security Service in
the West Bank. ``We will catch him.''
	   Rajoub said a taxi driver was detained after he gave Awadallah a
ride without recognizing him. ``Awadallah told the driver that he
needed to get to his father who had a stroke,'' Rajoub said.
	   Rajoub would not say where the driver took Awadallah.
	   Awadallah, 29, is a leading figure in Izzedine al Qassam, the
military wing of Hamas that has carried out more than a dozen
suicide bombings in Israel since 1994.
	   Awadallah was arrested by the Palestinian Authority in April and
accused of killing Hamas bombmaker Mohiyedin Sharif as part of an
internal dispute in the organization.
	   Israeli intelligence officials on Sunday briefed Cabinet
ministers on the escape and said there was suspicion that Awadallah
had inside help.
	   Rajoub said a preliminary investigation of Awadallah's jail
break found that the duty officer had left the cell door unlocked.
However, Rajoub said he was certain the officer was negligent and
was not trying to help Awadallah escape. No charges will be brought
against the officer, Rajoub said.
	   ``No one from inside helped Awadallah escape, that is for
sure,'' Rajoub said.
	   In another development Monday, about 150 Palestinian, European
and U.S. students attending the West Bank's Bir Zeit University
marched to an Israeli roadblock to protest against Israeli travel
restrictions for fellow students from the Gaza Strip.
	   Israeli police scuffled with students who tried to walk through
the checkpoint north of Jerusalem, and three Palestinian
demonstrators were arrested. Protesters carried Palestinian,
Spanish, Greek, Italian, British and Israeli flags and held banners
reading ``Education is a right, not a crime.''

Super League embraces new English club
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ Super League officials have overturned a
decision not to expand their English rugby league structure and
have admitted Gateshead as the competition's 13th franchise.
	   Consortiums from Gateshead, Cardiff and Swansea were vying for
franchises in the top flight British rugby league competition but
were all rejected last week due to problems with their business
plans.
	   However, the Super League executive reconvened at Leeds on
Monday and voted to admit Gateshead to the competition subject to
certain conditions being met by November.
	   Gateshead, near Newcastle in northeast England, was the venue
for games in the Super League roadshow earlier this season.
	   As a new club, Gateshead will be permitted to contract 20
foreign players. News of the admission was relayed directly to
Australia, where former Cronulla Sharks boss Shane Richardson is
assembling the nucleas of a squad.
	   Kerrod Walters, a former Australian test hooker currently
playing for the Adelaide Rams, is reportedly on the verge of
signing as Gateshead's inaugural captain.
	   Super League England chairman Chris Caisley said he was
delighted to welcome Gateshead into the competition.
	   ``The financial guarantees we were looking for have been
forthcoming and Gateshead Council have confirmed their long-term
commitment,'' he said.

	   ``We extend our deepest sympathy to all the families and

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Former Juventus star Gianluca Vialli on
Monday met with a prosecutor looking into allegations that he and
other players in Italy's top division soccer league took
performance-enhancing substances.
	   Vialli, now player-coach of English club Chelsea, was summoned
after AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman told Italian media he was amazed
by the quick muscular development of players including Vialli and
Alessandro Del Piero, a star-forward for Juventus.
	   Vialli walked past reporters without commenting following a 2
1/2-hour session with Turin prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello. He has
hotly denied taking illegal substances, calling the prosecutor a
``terrorist trying to destabilize the soccer world.''
	   During questioning Friday, Del Piero told Guariniello his
strength was the result of ``years of hard work.''
	   The prosecutor, who has been investigating doping in sports for
years, met with Zemen last week. The Czech coach stuck to his
allegations, but did not say which banned drugs the players
allegedly use.
	   Vialli, Del Piero and Juventus have all announced that they are
suing Zeman for libel.
	   In Bologna Monday, prosecutor Giovanni Spinosa interrogated
Italy's national soccer team doctor Paolo Zeppilli. The prosecutor
heard World Cup stars Dino Baggio and Enrico Chiesa last week.

Prosecutor interrogates former Juventus star Gianluca Vialli

	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Former Juventus star Gianluca Vialli met
Monday with a prosecutor looking into allegations that he and other
players in Italy's top division soccer league took
performance-enhancing substances.
	   Vialli, now player-coach of English club Chelsea, was summoned
after AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman told Italian media he was amazed
by the quick muscular development of players including Vialli and
Alessandro Del Piero, a star forward for Juventus.
	   Vialli walked past reporters without commenting following a 2
1/2-hour session with Turin prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello. He has
hotly denied taking illegal substances, calling the prosecutor a
``terrorist trying to destabilize the soccer world.''
	   During questioning Friday, Del Piero told Guariniello his
strength was the result of ``years of hard work.''
	   The prosecutor, who has been investigating doping in sports for
years, met with Zemen last week. The Czech coach stuck to his
allegations, but did not say which banned drugs the players
allegedly use.
	   Vialli, Del Piero and Juventus have all announced that they are
suing Zeman for libel.
	   In Bologna on Monday, prosecutor Giovanni Spinosa interrogated
Italy's national soccer team doctor, Paolo Zeppilli. The prosecutor
heard World Cup stars Dino Baggio and Enrico Chiesa last week.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ With an army of rebel fighters closing in
on his capital, a defiant President Laurent Kabila said in a radio
broadcast Monday his government will arm the people and prevail.
	   A few hours later, though, electricity was lost throughout
Kinshasa _ the second time since the rebels began their advance two
weeks ago. It was not immediate clear what caused the outage.
	   In his speech, the embattled president also lashed out at the
international community and accused the West of plotting against
his government.
	   The West ``has never been supportive of President Kabila simply
because I do not represent their interests,,'' Kabila said on
state-controlled Voice of the People radio. ``We have come and we
will stay here. In any case, the aggressors will fail.''
	   The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters, Rwandan
soldiers and disenchanted members of Kabila's military _ have been
making steady progress toward the capital, a western diplomat said
on condition of anonymity.
	   Charging Kabila with corruption and nepotism, rebel leaders
driving to topple the government have captured the western Congo
River port town of Matadi.
	   Many in the rebel movement helped Kabila oust longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997, but now say they have been
marginalized by the government.
	   A diplomat in Kinshasa said he had received reports from his
government that the rebels were now near the town of Mbanza-Ngungu,
about 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of the capital.
	   Kabila said Congo was the victim of a plot by neighboring Rwanda
_ which he says is orchestrating the rebellion _ along with the
West.
	   ``The next 24 hours will be decisive,'' Kabila said. ``We must
understand that we must win. This is the message I have for my
people, I am asking them to face up to this plot, to arm
themselves, to support their army, and to defeat the aggressors.''
	   He did not elaborate on why the following 24 hours were so
important.
	   While the situation was tense, life continued largely as normal
in many parts of Kinshasa, with most shops open and markets crowded
with people buying extra provisions.
	   In the Kinshasa suburb of Kingabwa, though, just south of the
city, witnesses said machine gun fire could be heard off and on
Monday as Congolese troops hunted down Rwandan soldiers who were
apparently hiding there. The soldiers are believed to be part of
the Rwandan contingent that had been in Kinshasa when the rebellion
broke out and who had exchanged fire with Kabila's soldiers before
going into hiding.
	   Further south of the city, in the suburb of Ngaba, the
government ordered all the shops closed. No reason was given for
the order, though the suburb is along the road that leads toward
the rebel units advancing on the city.
	   Heavily armed troops have closed all roads leading from Kinshasa
to Lower Congo province, where the rebels are mounting their
advance on the capital.
	   Facing a worsening crisis, Kabila called an emergency meeting of
his staff and Cabinet on Monday.
	   Kabila returned Sunday to Kinshasa from the Angolan capital of
Luanda, where he met with the presidents of Namibia and Angola.
	   The topics discussed at the meetings were not released publicly,
but the leaders recommended have scheduled a meeting of regional
defense ministers in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare.
	   ``The heads of state expressed their concern over the intensity
of military actions in (Congo), jeopardizing the stability of the
southern African region,'' Angolan television said.
	   Hundreds of westerners left Kinshasa over the weekend, while a
team of 50 British commandos has been deployed to Brazzaville, the
capital of the neighboring Republic of Congo, to help the
evacuation of British subjects.
	   An Royal Air Force Hercules carrying 50 soldiers flew over the
weekend from Ascension Island, where the Marines had been on
standby, to Brazzaville, the Britain's Ministry of Defence said.
	   The deployment of British troops in Brazzaville did not mean
there were immediate plans to withdraw British nationals, a
ministry spokesman said.
	   Brazzaville is directly across the Congo River from Kinshasa.
	   French troops already in Brazzaville helped hundreds of French,
Belgian and other foreigners cross the river on Saturday. From
Brazzaville _ still scarred from last year's civil war in the
Republic of Congo _ the evacuees were flown to safety.
	   Despite apparent military setbacks, the Congolese government
said Sunday that it was securing bases in the east and west of the
country in order to attack rebel forces.
	   In eastern Congo, rebel commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said
Monday his forces had taken the town of Lubutu, which is 210
kilometers (125 miles) from Kisangani, Congo's second-largest city.
	   Kabila's government has drawn support from the public in
Kinshasa by characterizing the rebel movement as a Rwandan Tutsi
war against Congo. Rwanda denies the charge.
	   Tutsis, an ethnic minority centered in eastern Congo and
neighboring countries, including Rwanda, have become the target of
attacks and arbitrary detentions in Kinshasa.

Japanese stocks fall, dollar higher in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES graf 4 to indicate that analysts predicting Nikkei
will fall below level in 1992 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks plunged to a two-month low, following
declines on Wall Street and doubts about the new prime minister's
ability to resuscitate Japan's economy. The U.S. dollar rose
against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 329.27
points, or 2.18 percent, to close at 14,794.66 _ its lowest since
June 17. On Friday, the Nikkei index sank 258.09 points, or 1.68
percent.
	   Analysts said the sharp fall could signal the start of another
miserable week for Tokyo stock prices, with financial instability
overseas compounding the dour outlook for domestic growth.
	   They predicted the Nikkei would soon dip under a low of
14,309.41, set in August 1992 _ the benchmark index's lowest level
since the bursting of Japan's asset-inflated bubble economy prices
eight years ago.
	   Worse, the pessimism in Tokyo, the world's second-largest
bourse, could spill back over into other major markets, driving
down share prices there even further, said analysts.
	   ``The external situation _ Russia and falls in the U.S. stock
market _ have made investors here very jittery,'' said Patrick
Mohr, a strategist at Merrill Lynch Japan.
	   On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.4
percent to 8,425.00, its lowest close since late February and
almost a tenth below its peak of 9,337.97 on July 17.
	   Investors are worried about the fate of a set of bills put
forward by incoming Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to stabilize
Japan's shaky financial system, said Eiji Tomaru, a manager in the
strategy section at Kankaku Securities Co.
	   Opposition lawmakers have criticized Obuchi's banking
legislation as a taxpayer-funded bailout which doesn't punish inept
executives.
	   Concerns the opposition could force the government to take
harsher measures, such as letting competition close down weaker
institutions, helped drive down the benchmark Nikkei average, said
Kevin Hebner, Japan equity strategist at Warburg Dillon Read.
	   While weeding out the weaker banks may be good in the long run,
the prospect drove down share prices of banks, the Tokyo market's
biggest component.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section tumbled 16.77 points, or 1.43 percent, to 1,152.03.
The TOPIX fell 12.91 points, or 1.09 percent on Friday.
	   An estimated 398 million shares changed hands on the first
section, below 433 million Friday. Declining issues overwhelmed
gainers almost 9-to-1.
	   On the currency exchange, the U.S. dollar rose on concerns about
a new round of financial turmoil in Russia and Asia.
	   The dollar bought 146.45 yen at late afternoon, up 1.57 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and above its late New York rate of 146.35
yen.
	   Persistent doubts about Russia's currency and economy led to a
surge in the dollar against the yen and other currencies in New
York on Friday, traders said.
	   Concerns about a new round of sell-offs in Southeast Asian
currency and stock markets also sent investors scurrying for the
safe haven of the greenback.
	   The dollar traded as low as 145.90 yen and as high as 146.90
yen.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.150 percent from Friday's finish of 1.175
yen, pushing its price up to 112.11 yen from 111.94 yen.

Culminating months of financial turmoil, Russia devalues ruble

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After weeks of financial turmoil, Russia sharply
devalued the shaky national currency on Monday in a move expected
to cause hardship for Russian consumers and rattle international
markets.
	   The Central Bank said it would permit the value of the ruble to
fall about 50 percent _ from about 6.3 to the dollar to 9.5 to the
dollar.
	   While most trading was suspended on the currency markets, the
price for dollars immediately jumped as high as 9.5 rubles on the
street.
	   President Boris Yeltsin, who had cut short his vacation and
returned to his country residence outside Moscow, met Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on Monday for a briefing, the Interfax
news agency reported, citing presidential spokesman Sergei
Yastrzhembsky.
	   The government ``needed to take effective steps in the current
situation, and we have done that,'' Kiriyenko said before meeting
Yeltsin.
	   The two leaders had also met on Sunday _ along with Anatoly
Chubais, Yeltsin's envoy to international financial institutions _
to agree on the impending devaluation, Yastrzhembsky said.
	   A ruble devaluation had been widely rumored, in part because the
government faces heavy payments on ruble-denominated debt in coming
days and weeks.
	   ``The Russian leadership has taken these steps only after
exhausting other options,'' Chubais said. He blamed the situation
on the Asian crisis and a recent drop in world oil prices.
	   Kiriyenko declined to call the move a devaluation, since
technically the government only lowered the limit to which it would
allow the price of the ruble to fall and the markets set the actual
price.
	   But with most currency trading suspended or tightly controlled,
the situation on the street _ where banks immediately raised rates
above 8 to the dollar and as high as 9.5 _ made it clear that the
ruble's value had fallen to the new level.
	   The government also forced a restructuring of short-term debts,
saying it would halt payment on government treasury bills and
impose a 90-day moratorium on payments of foreign debt.
	   Chubais insisted that the government was not defaulting.
	   ``We are not reneging on our debts,'' he said. ``We realize that
many of our partners will feel uncomfortable, but any hesitation on
our part would cost them far more.''
	   An IMF arrived in Moscow on Sunday in advance of the move and
met with Chubais on Monday. He said the team, led by John
Odling-Smee, had been consulted and supported the government's
actions. He also said they intend to release another disbursement
of a multibillion dollar loan next month.
	   The devaluation is a tricky political move for the government.
It will sharply raise the prices of imports, which account for a
large percentage of Russian consumer goods, including more than
half the food sold in stores.
	   However, it was also expected to ease the government's budget
crunch, making it possible to pay months of wages and pensions owed
to Russians.
	   Government officials put the best spin on the situation. Central
Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin said the government action was ``aimed
at protecting Russian citizens and domestic producers.''
	   ``The government has decided to act in favor of them and against
traders in the hard currency and bond markets,'' he said, according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The price of the ruble dropped only slightly when the currency
market opened, slipping from 6.31 to 6.43 in early trading. The
stock market opened 45 minutes late, but after an initial drop the
index was up slightly _ 0.19 percent _ by midday.
	   Immediate public reaction to the devaluation was muted, with
some Russians approaching exchange booths only to turn back when
they saw the massive increase.
	   ``It was hard to survive before on my pension of 350 rubles a
month,'' said pensioner Yelena Bochet, 68. ``But now I simply don't
know what to do because all the prices will certainly soar.''
	   The devaluation was also expected to lead to the collapse of
many Russian commercial banks, which are over-dependent on
now-devalued ruble assets. The government and Central Bank said
they would pool the resources of leading banks to limit the damage.
	   They also proposed legislation to strengthen controls over
Russian financial markets in an effort to halt further capital
flight.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov denounced the devaluation as a
``full-scale bankruptcy'' of Yeltsin's government.
	   Yeltsin's economic advisor Alexander Livshits submitted his
resignation on Monday, saying he accepts part of responsibility for
the crisis. Several other top officials were also rumored to be in
line for resignation.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Though defiant in words against an
advancing rebel army, President Laurent Kabila has left his
embattled capital for the second time in a week and headed to the
southern city of Lubumbashi, a government official said Monday.
	   Kabila had returned to Kinshasa Sunday afternoon after meeting
his counterpart in Angola in that country's capital, Luanda.
	   State television has repeatedly shown Kabila arriving at
Kinshasa's airport, smiling and defiantly denouncing the rebels.
	   What the state broadcasting service did not mention was that
Kabila quickly reboarded his presidential jet and headed back to
Lubumbashi, where he spent much of last week, a senior government
minister told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
	   ``The president is back in Lubumbashi, but he said he would be
returning to Kinshasa tonight,'' the official said.
	   A daily Congolese newspaper, the French-language Palmares,
reported the same information.
	   By Monday afternoon, electricity was lost throughout Kinshasa _
the second time since the rebels began their advance two weeks ago.
It was not immediate clear what caused the outage.
	   The loss of power cut off state radio and television.
	   Before the electricity failed, state radio had been repeatedly
broadcast Kabila saying his government will arm the people and
prevail against a rebel movement of ethnic Tutsi fighters, Rwandan
soldiers and disenchanted members of the president' own military.
	   He also lashed out at the international community and accused
the West of plotting against his government.
	   Western nations have ``never been supportive of President Kabila
simply because I do not represent their interests,'' Kabila said on
state-controlled Voice of the People radio. ``We have come and we
will stay here. In any case, the aggressors will fail.''
	   The rebels have been making steady progress toward the capital,

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The schooner Atlanta picked up American
millionaire-adventurer Steve Fossett on Monday from the Coral Sea,
where he landed when his balloon went down in a storm during his
around-the-world attempt, authorities said.
	   Fossett was safe aboard the 60-foot (18 meter) Atlanta and was
expected to be taken aboard the New Zealand navy tanker Endeavour
within the next couple of hours, New Zealand Defense Force
spokesman Bill Morley said.
	   Australian Maritime Safety Authority spokesman Brian Hill said
Fossett was safe and well, and would board the Endeavour about
midnight (1400 GMT).
	   ``The rescue was very straight-forward. Mr. Fossett is in good
health and given that he is out of danger, they might proceed to
Townsville tonight,'' Hill said.

Israel approves plan to set up barriers along 1967 border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The government's decision to set up barriers
along the invisible Green Line between Israel and the West Bank,
ostensibly to stop car thefts, could hurt Israel in negotiations
with the Palestinians, a deputy minister said Monday.
	   The Cabinet voted Sunday to erect the barriers, including
boulders, concrete walls and electronic devices, along stretches
totaling about 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the 324 kilometer-long
(200 mile) pre-1967 border between Israel and the West Bank.
	   Police estimate that a car is stolen in Israel every 12 seconds,
with many of the them ending up in Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   The future border between Israel and a Palestinian entity will
be the key issue once Israel and the Palestinians hold negotiations
on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Deputy Education Minister Moshe Peled said Monday that by
deciding to set up the barriers, Israel could pre-empt the outcome
of the negotiations.
	   ``We are throwing money away,'' Peled said. ``I am sure this
intelligent country can think up better ways to fight theft and
terror than re_making a non_existent border.''
	   Peled said the Cabinet decision would give the Palestinians
false hope that Israel might one day return all of the West Bank.
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
War, getting rid of the barbed wire which marked the border and
building new roads and settlements across it.
	   Other critics said the government's decision was hasty. Uzi
Landau, chairman of parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs
Committee, said the government should formulate a new security
doctrine before deciding whether to set up a divider, however
temporary.
	   Yossi Sarid, a legislator from the dovish opposition Meretz
Party, said the Cabinet decision was final proof that the hardline
government had abandoned its claims to all of the West Bank.
	   ``It has again been proven that the viewpoint of the dovish camp
is the more sober and practical one,'' Sarid told Israeli daily
Yediot Ahronot.

Island authorities arrest Turks for raising Turkish flag in port
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Turks released, trial date set for April 1999 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KALYMNOS, Greece (AP) _ Six Turks, including a heart surgeon and
a Mercedes dealer, were arrested Monday after allegedly raising
their nation's flag on a lamp post during a local festival,
authorities said.
	   They were released on the nearby island of Kos after a public
prosecutor charged them with disturbing the peace, disturbing
national sentiments, and leaving port without obtaining sailing
permission. A trial date was set for March 1999.
	   Although the charges were misdemeanors, residents of this island
near the Turkish coach were infuriated by the incident.
	   National symbols evoke strong emotions on Aegean islands near
the Turkish coast _ an area where Turks have questioned Greek
sovereignty over many of the islets and rocky specks.
	   Two years ago, the hoisting of the Turkish flag on the nearby
eastern Aegean islet of Imia, known as Kardak in Turkish, almost
led Greece and Turkey to war.
	   The six Turks arrived here aboard the 22-meter (72-foot) Turkish
yacht Eda on Sunday during celebrations of the island's honey
production. One of the group, sailor Gunay Zeybeker, allegedly
raised the Turkish flag early Monday, the merchant marine said.
	   Officials said the incident was photographed and filmed by
Cengiz Menteseoglu, a partner in a Mercedes dealership in Istanbul,
Turkey.
	   Greeks participating in the local festival nearby ``moved in a
threatening manner against them'' upon seeing the flag, the
ministry said.
	   The group fled on the yacht, but failed to obtain sailing
permission, officials said. The boat's captain, Sevket Gaykan, did
not board and was arrested by port authorities.
	   The Eda was intercepted by a Greek coast guard patrol boat. The
five Turks _ including Menteseoglu's wife Gonca; heart surgeon Dr.
Atilla Kayihan and his wife Leyla _ were led to the island of Kos,
about seven kilometers (four miles) from the Turkish mainland.
	   Court officials in Kos refused to comment on the proceedings.
	   Kalymnos Mayor Dimitris Diakomihalis called the flag raising ``a
very provocative act.''
	   ``These are not isolated actions in my opinion. They are actions
which send many messages,'' he added.
	   Diakomihalis had aroused controversy himself in 1996 by raising
the Greek flag on Imia just after the crisis.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Commission President Jacques
Santer said Monday the blast in Omagh that killed 28 and wounded
220 must not derail the peace process in Northern Ireland.
	   In a statement, Santer expressed his ``very deep shock and
dismay'' at the bombing.
	   ``We extend our deepest sympathy to all the families and friends
of those killed,'' he added on behalf of the 20-member EU executive
Commission.
	   Santer said the bombing must not halt peace efforts.
	   ``We believe unequivocally that supporting the peace process is
the only way forward toward lasting peace and reconciliation'' in
Northern Ireland, he added.

Police arrest two men on suspicion of extorting airline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with JAL president's comment in graf 7-8; CLARIFIES
JAL's suspected role in graf 6.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police on Monday arrested two men on suspicion of
extorting 22.8 million yen (dlrs 155,000) from Japan Airlines Co.,
a spokesman said.
	   The two were alleged ``sokaiya'' racketeer Hitoshi Ogasawara,
51, and Mamoru Arai, 53, the president of a leasing company,
Taihei, said a police spokesman who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   The alleged extortion was reportedly in return for promising to
ensure trouble-free shareholders' meetings for the airline, he
said.
	   JAL, Japan's largest airline, is the latest company to be named
in a widening crackdown on racketeering that brought the arrest
last year of executives from top companies such as Nomura
Securities Co., Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and Mitsubishi Motors
Corp.
	   A number of JAL executives have already admitted involvement in
the scheme and their case will soon be forwarded to the Public
Prosecutor's Office, news reports said.
	   JAL is suspected of hiding payments to the racketeers under the
pretext of leasing artificial flowers from Arai's company, the
newspaper Asahi reported.
	   JAL president Isao Kaneko said the payment was part of a
business contract until the end of last year.
	   ``What happened, however, was very regrettable from the
corporate ethics point of view,'' Kaneko told a news conference,
nationally televised on Japan's semi-government network NHK.
	   Ogasawara allegedly is a senior member of a sokaiya racketeer
group, the police spokesman said.
	   Sokaiya are a unique feature of the corporate Japanese
landscape. Famous for blackmailing executives by threatening to
reveal embarassing corporate secrets at annual shareholders
meetings, many are actually hired by companies to silence hostile
shareholders.
	   Authorities believe Arai's company to be controlled by the
notorious Sumiyoshi-kai underworld syndicate, according to the
Asahi.
	   Police suspect the men helped manage JAL shareholders' meetings
since 1990, the Asahi said. The men have allegedly receive a total
of 76 million yen (dlrs 520,000), but the charges only cover part
of that, Kyodo said.

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police arrested five people
Monday on suspicion of killing 28 men, women and children in the
little town of Omagh, whose residents struggled to come to grips
with its entry into the province's grim history books.
	   The five suspects were arrested at dawn in two villages north
and southeast of Omagh and taken to the main police interrogation
center in Belfast, 70 miles (110 kms) to the east, where under
British anti-terrorist law they can be held for up to a week before
being charged or released.
	   Francis Mackey, a leading member of a group under suspicion in
connection with the bombing, denied on Monday that the organization
was to blame, and said his 19-year-old son, Shane, was one of those
arrested. Mackey is chairman of the 32 County Sovereignty
Committee, which denies allegations it is affiliated with the
``Real IRA,'' a group of IRA dissidents trying to wreck the
province's April peace agreement.
	   Two of the dead and 10 of the injured were visiting from Spain,
and the country's deputy prime minister, Francisco Alvarez-Cascos,
flew to the province to be with the victims and their relatives
and, he said, to ``express with my presence the solidarity of the
community enduring this situation.''
	   In the town of Omagh, each resident seemed to have a story to
tell, offered in flat tones of disbelief: A school chum who won't
be in class next month. A father and son who no longer will enliven
a neighborhood. A shopkeeper who never again will greet customers
with a ready smile.

Iranian soccer star suffers head injury in car accident

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian soccer star Mehdi Mahdavikia was
injured along with his wife when his car hit a tree in the Caspian
province of Mazandaran, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Monday.
	   Mahdavikia, who scored the winning goal against the United
States in this year's World Cup, suffered head injuries in Sunday's
accident in the provincial capital of Chalous, the agency said. His
wife suffered leg injuries.
	   No other vehicles were involved in the accident, which occurred
as Mahdavikia was returning to Tehran from a summer vacation.
	   Mahdavikia, 22, and his wife were reported to be in stable
condition in hospital and were visited by a number of fans as well
as the mayor and governor of Chalous.
	   Following a standout performance in Iran's three World Cup
matches, Mahdavikia was tipped to join a number of European clubs,
including England's Tottenham Hotspur, Holland's Ajax, Italy's
Inter Milan or Hamburg of Germany. But his local club Piroozi has
yet to release him.
	   In 1997, Mahdavikia was named Asia's Young Player of the Year.

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More than 500 employees of a bank being
shut down by the government protested the move Monday, saying they
will lose their livelihoods.
	   An estimated 5,000 people will lose their jobs when Bangkok Bank
of Commerce completely ceases operations by the end of next year.
It has already been suspended from most banking activities as part
of a sweeping restructuring of the debt-laden banking system
announced by the government on Friday.
	   Angry over the impending layoffs, bank employees demanded the
government provide them with financial aid or find them new jobs.
	   ``Some of us have been working for the bank for 20 years, does
the government care what will happen to my family? How could I find
a job at this age?'' said a protester in his early forties.
	   Employees in provincial branches have flooded the bank's
headquarter's with thousands of phone calls, expressing their fears
of being jobless in the midst of Thailand's worst economic crisis
in decades.
	   ``I don't know what to do. I have family to feed, and house and
car loans to pay off,'' said another employee.

German opposition says tax cuts will take time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ After promising tax cuts for their first
100 days in office if elected, the Social Democrat party chairman
conceded Monday it would take longer than that before voters saw
the full benefit.
	   Franz Muentefering, the Social Democratic administrative
manager, told a Berlin newspaper over the weekend that his party
planned to move quickly to reduce taxes, saying the average family
of four would save 2,500 marks (dlrs 1,400) a year.
	   But after a session of top party leaders Monday in Bonn,
chairman Oskar Lafontaine said the full amount would probably have
to be achieved in several steps, which would take more than a year.
He blamed the stretched federal budget.
	   Finance Minister Theo Waigel has also said that Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's tax reform plan would probably require two phases and
take until 2000 at least.
	   While Kohl's center-right coalition is promising total tax cuts
of 30 billion marks (dlrs 16.9 billion), the Social Democrats say
only about a third of that is doable.
	   At the forefront of their 100-day plan, to be presented by the
party's chancellor candidate, Gerhard Schroeder, in Berlin
Thursday, are efforts to cut unemployment by boosting domestic
buying power and thus, hopefully, demand for German products,
Lafontaine said.
	   He said the party intends to repeal reforms that would are to
begin cutting pensions in 1999 from 70 percent to 64 percent of
past salary.

Fires rage in central Italy, threatening popular national park
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Firefighters struggled Monday to extinguish a fire
that has burned more than 20 hectares (50 acres) of forest close to
one of Italy's most popular national parks.
	   Workers used four planes and a helicopter to drop water on the
blaze in the Abruzzo region, about 200 kilometers (125 miles)
northeast of Rome. Authorities fear the fire, which started Sunday,
will spread to the Gran Sasso national park.
	   Fires also broke out in the Marche region north of Abruzzo.
Flames raging near the town of Castelletta di Fabriano blackened
400 hectares (990 acres) and forced the evacuation of 200
residents, Canale 5 television reported.
	   In Calabria, the toe of the boot-shaped Italian peninsula,
authorities evacuated a hospital Monday to get patients away from
the smoke of a nearby blaze.
	   Weeks of temperatures in the mid- to upper 30s (90s) and sparse
rain have fed fires throughout Italy. Authoritities believe some of
the fires were intentionally set.

Albright leaves for Tanzania, Kenya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Maryland (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright headed to Africa Monday for a one-day visit to
Kenya and Tanzania to show support for bomb-struck embassy workers
and for East Africans caught in the terrorist attacks.
	   ``To America's embassy personnel in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, I
will bring a message of solidarity in their sorrow, admiration for
their courage and support for their continued efforts on behalf of
our country,'' Albright said before leaving. ``To the people of
Kenya and Tanzania, I will bring a message of friendship, made
deeper by our shared grief, and of support in doing all we can to
ease their suffering and help them start anew.''
	   Just ahead of Albright's trip, the State Department on Sunday
issued an updated ``worldwide caution'' to U.S. travelers in the
aftermath of the Aug. 7 bombings at American embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania and because of fresh threats to U.S. interests abroad.
	   An accompanying statement specifically warned ``against all
travel to Pakistan.'' The State Department also ordered the
departure of all non-emergency personnel and families of employees
from the embassy at Islamabad and from U.S. consulates in Karachi,
Lahore and Peshawar.
	   The warnings came after Pakistan handed over to Kenyan officials
a suspect in the U.S. Embassy bombings, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, also
known as Mohammad Sadiq Howaida and Abdull Bast Awadh.
	   Albright's visit to East Africa was designed in part to
demonstrate U.S. resolve in the face of growing terrorist threats
to Americans.
	   Some Kenyans have complained that after the Nairobi bombing,
rescuers gave priority to finding American victims and to
protecting evidence at the expense of saving African lives. But
Albright and other U.S. officials have strongly disputed that
notion, saying the priority had been rescuing all possible, African
and American.
	   On Friday, when Albright set aside vacation plans for the
hastily planned trip to East Africa, the State Department had
lifted a warning against travel to Kenya, whose economy relies
heavily on foreign visitors, to further ease any strain in the
aftermath of the tragedy.
	   Albright, after a 16-hour flight, is scheduled to spend only
five hours on the ground in Dar es Salaam, her first stop Tuesday
morning, and then about 5 1/2 hours in Nairobi later in the day
before returning immediately home without an overnight rest.
	   Over the weekend, President Bill Clinton extended condolences to
the families and friends of Kenyans and Tanzanians killed in the
bombings and said he was praying for the recovery of the injured.
	   ``We grieve together,'' he said in a videotaped message.
	   Clinton also praised the joint nature of the investigation in
which more than 200 FBI agents are working closely with local
authorities.
	   ``I am proud that our nations have also renewed our commitment
to stand together to bring the offender swiftly to justice, to
combat terrorism in all its forms and to create a more tolerant and
peaceful world for our children,'' Clinton said.

Social Democrat government faces vote of confidence Tuesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The one-party minority government
of Social Democrats is set to face a vote of confidence Tuesday in
Czech parliament.
	   The vote will come less than two months after the election of
the first center-left government since communism ended in 1989.
	   The three-party coalition government of Vaclav Klaus collapsed
in November and was replaced by an interim government designed to
lead the country until a new government could be chosen in early
elections.
	   Opposition Social Democrats, led by Milos Zeman, won the ballot.
The Civic Democratic Party of ex-premier Klaus came in a close
second.
	   After Zeman, as premier, failed to negotiate a coalition
government with smaller parties, he struck a stability pact with
Klaus.
	   Czech law requires that after a government takes office,
parliament must conduct a confidence vote to determine whether the
cabinet has enough political power to implement its programs.
	   Social Democrats control 74 seats in the 200-seat legislature,
way short of the simple majority needed to win the confidence vote.
	   According to the agreement, all 63 of Klaus' deputies will walk
out before the vote. That will leave just 137 legislators present,
meaning the government will need only 69 votes to survive the vote
of confidence.
	   The motion then could be carried by Social Democrats alone, even
if all other deputies voted against it.
	   The Christian Democrats and the Freedom Union, which control a
total of 39 deputies, have said they would vote against Zeman.
	   Both parties say they disagree with his Social Democratic
policies.
	   The position of Communists, with 24 deputies, was not
immediately clear.
	   In foreign policy, the Social Democrats' priorities, such as
integration into the European Union and NATO, are similar to those
of previous governments.
	   The Social Democrats want to slow down privatization and price
liberalization as the country's economy stagnates at zero growth.
	   However, their intention to strengthen the role of the state and
trade unions in the fledgling free market of the post-communist era
is likely to meet with opposition.
	   ``We are prepared to tolerate this government, but the real
battle will take place over individual laws as they are
presented,'' said Klaus, now the parliament's speaker.

Romanian star set to leave Chelsea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Romanian international Dan Petrescu could become
the first foreign casualty at Chelsea as Gianluca Vialli tries to
balance the budget after splashing out 12 million pounds (dlrs 19.7
million) on players during the off-season.
	   Petrescu, who scored the winning goal in Romania's victory over
England in a World Cup group match this summer, was not named in
Chelsea's squad for its season opener against Conventry on
Saturday.
	   Chelsea, which fielded nine foreign players in its starting 11,
lost the game 2-1.
	   Vialli told the 30-year-old defender he was free to leave
Stamford Bridge, the Express newspaper reported Monday.
	   ``I am very sad,'' Petrescu was quoted as saying. ``Chelsea want
to sell me. Vialli said I will not be playing in the first XI this
year. If can find a club to go to, I will leave.''
	   Chelsea, which has an annual salary bill exceeding 23 million
pounds (dlrs 37.4 million), is expected to place a 2 million pound
(dlrs 3.25 million) transfer fee on Petrescu.
	   Veteran Welsh international Mark Hughes was the first
high-profile departure from Stamford Bridge after the Chelsea boss
signed Brian Laudrup, Pierluigi Casiraghi, Albert Ferrer and Marcel
Desailly in the off-season.
	   Hughes, who signed with Chelsea in 1995 _ the same year as
Petrescu _ transfered to Southampton.
	   Petrescu, who was in Bucharest this week, has been linked with
moves to Dutch club Ajax or Read Madrid. He has 60 caps for
Romania. He played 31 games for Chelsea last season and scored five
goals.

Goalkeeper Lama to make international comeback against Austria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Goalkeeper Bernard Lama joined the French soccer
squad that flew to Vienna Monday and is a definite starter for this
week's match against Austria.
	   Lama, 35, replaces France's first choice goalkeeper Fabien
Bathez, who injured his left thigh playing for Monaco on Saturday.
	   Lama, who this year moved back to Paris Saint-Germain after a
spell at England's West Ham, won the last of his 37 international
caps against Morocco in May.
	   Although Lama was not in the original squad named last week for
Wednesday's match against Austria in Vienna, Roger Lemerre,
France's new coach, said he remains Bathez's deputy.
	   Lama's call up was the only change to Lemerre's squad for
France's first match since it won the World Cup in July.

 &UR; Iranian soccer star suffers head injury in car accident

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian soccer star Mehdi Mahdavikia was
injured along with his wife when his car hit a tree in the Caspian
province of Mazandaran, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Monday.
	   Mahdavikia, who scored the winning goal against the United
States in this year's World Cup, suffered head injuries in Sunday's
accident in the provincial capital of Chalous, the agency said. His
wife suffered leg injuries.
	   No other vehicles were involved in the accident, which occurred
as Mahdavikia was returning to Tehran from a summer vacation.
	   Mahdavikia, 22, and his wife were reported to be in stable
condition in hospital and were visited by a number of fans as well
as the mayor and governor of Chalous.
	   Following a standout performance in Iran's three World Cup
matches, Mahdavikia was tipped to join a number of European clubs,
including England's Tottenham Hotspur, Holland's Ajax, Italy's
Inter Milan or Hamburg of Germany. But his local club Piroozi has
yet to release him.
	   In 1997, Mahdavikia was named Asia's Young Player of the Year.

Presidents of Ukraine, Russia may meet informally this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and his
Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin have reached a preliminary
agreement to meet informally in Yeltsin's residence near Moscow
this week, a top Ukraianian official said Monday.
	   Yeltsin and Kuchma have agreed to meet in the Zavidovo residence
between Thursday and Saturday, presidential chief-of-staff Yevhen
Kushnaryov said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   He said the two sides have already finalized a list of questions
the two presidents are to discuss, most of them concerning economic
cooperation.
	   Last month, Yeltsin and Kuchma agreed to hold a summit in the
eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv on Sept. 18-19 with large
government delegations participating.
	   Ukrainian government officials have since indicated that the two
presidents might have another meeting before that date.
	   In February, the two leaders signed an ambitious economic
cooperation plan, and Yeltsin said that there were ``no unsettled
problems'' left between the two nations.
	   However, there has been discord over Russian customs taxes on
Ukrainian goods and there have been frictions in recent years over
issues such as control of the Black Sea naval bases from the Soviet
era and Ukraine's natural gas debts to Russia.
	   Also, the Russian parliament has failed to ratify a friendship
treaty that was signed last year.

Record traffic deaths mar holiday weekend
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Greece's police chief Monday ordered a
nationwide crackdown on traffic violators after a record 41 people
were killed and 458 injured in 302 accidents during the holiday
weekend.
	   Gen. Athanasios Vasilopoulos ordered police around the country
to increase patrols on the nation's highways and ``to be especially
strict with violators.''
	   Extra measures include more random road blocks, alcohol tests
and speed traps.
	   Accidents deaths during the weekend Assumption of the Virgin
holiday, one of the most important in Greece, were considerably
higher than those during the four-day Orthodox Easter exodus
earlier this year.
	   During that holiday, 35 motorists were killed and about 500
injured. Two years ago, a record 36 people died during the annual
Easter exodus and return.
	   Greece and Portugal have the highest road death records in
Europe.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Kuwait Investment Projects Co. announced
Monday it has posted 8.28 million dinars (dlrs 27.05 million) in
net profits in the first half of the year, down from 16 million
dinars (dlrs 52.28 million) in the corresponding period last year.
	   Ahmed al-Ajeel, vice president for marketing and public
relations, told The Associated Press that KIPCO had ``extraordinary
revenues'' last year from selling its stake in a local bank. He
said the generally low prices at the Kuwait Stock Exchange this
year were also partly responsible for the drop because most of the
companies owned by KIPCO are listed.
	   KIPCO is a conglomerate investment holding company that controls
dlrs 6 billion (1.83 billion dinars) in assets in Kuwait and
abroad. It invests in industries, real estate and media ventures.
	   It is listed on the exchange with a paid-up capital of 105
million dinars (dlrs 343.13 million).
 &UR; ___
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The Bahrain-based Arab Insurance Group,
B.S.C., said Monday that its net profit for the first half of this
year slumped 64 percent to dlrs 8.1 million compared with gains
during the same period last year.
	   Net profit for the 1997 first half ending June 30 totaled dlrs
22.6 million, the company said in a statement.
	   However, the assets for the 1998 first half surged heavily by 58
percent to dlrs 1.51 billion from dlrs 959 million in the first six
months of last year, the company popularly known as ARIG said.
	   ARIG, which is the world's 50th largest insurance company, did
not comment on the decline in profits or increase in assets.
	   The insurance company, the Arab World's largest, has 50.5 shares
listed on several Arab stock exchanges, including Bahrain, Kuwait,
Oman and Cairo. It also has global depository receipts in the
London Stock Market.
	   The remaining shares are held equally by the governments of
Kuwait, Libya and the United Arab Emirates.
 &UR; ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Middle East Airlines, Lebanon's
debt-ridden national carrier, might be sold to the private sector
to avoid further loss, An-Nahar newspaper reported Monday.
	   It quoted an unnamed expert in the aviation industry as saying
that ``a secret plan'' was being studied to privatize MEA's basic
services to spare the company losses that may reach dlrs 100
million this year.
	   A report prepared by Christian Ballan, a member of MEA's board
of directors and a former chairman of the French national carrier,
Air France, confirmed that MEA might become ``a profit-making
company if it was cleaned from corruption and the policy of
nepotism and commissions was halted,'' the paper said.
	   The state-owned MEA, which employs about 5,000 people, is
Lebanon's second biggest employer after the public sector. It has a
fleet of 15 aircraft and their destinations include South America
and Singapore.
	   MEA, which flourished before the 1975-90 civil war when Lebanon
was a regional hub, fell victim to the conflict. The airline
incurred dlrs 100 million losses in the past few years.
	   The government bought a 99 percent stake in the company after
debts owed to the Central Bank were converted into shares.

Romania wants to get old planes and helicopters from Clinton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Prime Minister Radu Vasile has asked
U.S. President Bill Clinton to help the Romanian army obtain used
planes and helicopters, the defense ministry confirmed Monday.
	   In a letter published in Adevarul daily on Saturday, Vasile
wrote to Clinton in July asking for a donation of 50 to 60 retired
Cobra attack helicopters and six to eight fighter planes to be used
for training Romanian troops on western equipment.
	   ``In this way, we would be conserving our limited financial
resources while gaining the experience we need,'' to reach NATO
standards, Vasile wrote. He also said American and Romanian
companies could be employed in any renovation work needed on the
aircraft.
	   Vassal's letter comes amid heated discussions over the
government's decision to guarantee a dlrs 1.45 billion loan to
purchase 96 attack AH1RO Dracula helicopters to be produced by U.S.
company Bell Textron and a Romanian company.
	   Critics, including the International Monetary Fund, argue that
the 14-year loan needed to purchase the choppers, which would cost
Romania an additional dlrs 120 to 200 million each year, would
cripple the country's already ailing economy.
	   The defense ministry, which supports the deal that has been
under negotiations for the past four years, says having the
helicopters will enhance Romania's chances of receiving an
invitation to join NATO.
	   Romania did not meet the requirements to be among the first east
European countries asked to join the military alliance in July
1997, when Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic were given
invitations.
	   In a statement, the defense ministry said the premier's proposal
was not an alternative to the Bell Textron deal, but for training
until the new ones arrived.
	   Discussions have become so heated, that even the Romanian
Orthodox Church has entered the fray. In his Saturday Ascension Day
mass, a prominent Church leader said the helicopter deal was too
costly.
	   ``Let them come and make as many helicopters as they want there,
but we don't need them. Let's keep within our means,'' Adevarul
daily quoted Pimen as saying.

UNHCR: Stranded Iraqi family qualifies for refugee status
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN FALCHETTO &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Iraqi women and her three children, who
have been stranded at Cairo International Airport for 18 days,
qualify as political refugees, U.N. officials said Monday.
	   That means that the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees can try
to reunite Mahasen Hamid with her husband, an opponent of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein who is living as a refugee in Germany,
said Panos Moumtzis, who heads the UNHCR office in Cairo.
	   Hamid and the children _ sons Ali, 10, and Zaeen, 8, and
daughter Rayam, 7 _ have been living in a detention room at the
airport since July 31.
	   Moumtzis said they had ``little money left to buy more food''
and were making do with handouts from airport security people and
cleaners.
	   She had feared deportation to Iraq after the family was visited
at the airport by an Iraqi diplomat.
	   But Moumtzis and Egyptian officials said that wouldn't happen.
	   ``We believe it is a very serious case because the husband is a
political refugee and their (the family's) deportation could
endanger their lives,'' Moumtzis said.
	   He said, however, that it could take months to work out the
details of the family's reunification.
	   Mohammed Khadrawi, an Egyptian Foreign Ministry official in
charge of refugees, told The Associated Press that Hamid and the
children would not be deported to Iraq.
	   ``Egypt has a long tradition of hospitality toward refugees, and
we will not deport her to the country of origin,'' Khadrawi said.
	   Reporters have not been given permission to visit Mahasen, and
it was unclear why she has not been allowed out of the airport.
	   ``We are working with the Egyptian government to allow Hamid ...
to leave the airport,'' Moumtzis said.
	   Hamid's husband, Hadi al-Mohammed, 41, participated in the
uprising against Saddam's regime that followed the Gulf War in
1991, according to his brother, Hassan al-Mohammed Hassan.
	   Al-Mohammed fled Iraq that year to an Arab country and then to
Germany three years ago, where he lives as a refugee.
	   Hamid's case came to public attention after Hassan learned of
her plight and sent a letter to the UNHCR seeking help.
	   Hassan said in a telephone interview from his home in Glasgow,
Scotland, that Hamid had left Iraq for Jordan last February in
hopes of joining her husband in Germany.
	   He said she and the children flew via Cairo to Budapest,
Hungary, where she hoped a professional smuggler would help get her
into Europe.
	   But the smuggler stole her passport in Budapest, and the family
spent a month at the airport there before they were sent back to
Cairo.

IMF urges immediate tax reform in Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Economy &QL; 
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The head of the International Monetary Fund
urged on Monday Russia's parliament, the Duma, to quickly approve
measures aimed at increasing tax revenues to help the country
through its prolonged financial crisis.
	   Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, said in a
statement the IMF will immediately analyze steps taken by the
Russian government to stabilize plunging financial markets. These
include a devaluation of the ruble, announced earlier in the day,
that is expected to reach 50 percent.
	   The IMF's top negotiator for Russia, John Odling-Smee, arrived
in Moscow Monday for talks with Russian officials, an IMF spokesman
said.
	   Last month the IMF approved a dlrs 22.5 billion rescue package
to help Russia overcome sharp losses on its financial markets and
stabilize the ruble. However the plan failed to restore investor
confidence.
	   Camdessus said the government has been satisfactorily
implementing economic measures that were part of the plan.
	   ``Despite this, confidence in financial markets has not been
reestablished and as a result Russia has continued to lose reserves
and asset prices have fallen sharply,'' Camdessus' statement said.
	   He said that even though the government had stopped using
reserves to defend the ruble, it had to continue implementing the
plan.
	   ``As a preliminary reaction, I am of the view that, in the new
context created by these measures, it will be especially important
for the Russians authorities to take all necessary steps to
strengthen the fiscal position.''
	   ``Prompt passage of the fiscal measures in the forthcoming
session of the Duma will be essential to this end,'' Camdessus said
referring to the need to boost tax revenues.
	   The Duma meets Aug. 21 to consider the government's anti-crisis
measures.
	   ``I hope that the government's economic program will continue to
be implemented in full, so that the economic and financial
situation will improve and the IMF will be in a position to
disburse the second trance under the enhanced fund program in
September, as scheduled,'' Camdessus said.
	   The IMF disbursed a first installment of dlrs 4.8 billion when
the rescue package was first announced last month. The second
payment that Camdessus referred to totals dlrs 5.6 billion.
	   Some investors were hoping for more aid to Russia from the IMF
and Western lenders who put together the July package. But White
House spokesman Mike McCurry said the U.S. and Russian president's
did not discuss new aid in their phone conversation Friday.

Northern Ireland calls off soccer international after Omagh bomb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Ireland (AP) _ Wednesday's scheduled international
soccer friendly between Northern Ireland and Malta in Belfast was
called off Monday in the wake of the bombing in Omagh.
	   The Irish Football Association announced the move after
consulting with the government and the Malta Football Association.
	   An under-21 international between the two countries scheduled
for Tuesday was also canceled as a mark of respect to the victims
of the bombing.
	   A car bomb killed 28 people and injured more than 220 when it
exploded in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh, 70 miles west of
Belfast, on Saturday.
	   It was the worst single terrorist attack in 30 years of conflict
in the province.

Half of Poles against new crosses by the Auschwitz memorial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ About half of Poles say they are against
the crosses that Catholic activists have recently erected near the
former Nazi death camp of Auschwitz, according to a poll published
on Monday.
	   But 73 percent of respondents said the papal cross that has
stood there since 1988 should remain.
	   Conservative Catholics have erected more than 50 crosses in
recent weeks to protest Jewish calls for the removal of the 8-meter
(26-foot) papal cross, which memorializes 152 Poles executed at the
site by the Nazis.
	   Jewish groups have said the large cross, which was used in a
1979 papal Mass at the camp, disturbs the memory of the 1.5 million
Jews who died there.
	   Almost all Poles _ 89 percent _ said they have heard of the
crosses conflict. Only 32 percent were in favor of keeping the new
crosses, while 48 percent said they should go.
	   Some 90 percent in this nation of 39 million declare themselves
as Catholics.
	   The poll of 968 adults was done Aug. 7-10 by the private
Demoskop agency. Its margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

Eight people found dead in container on ship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Eight people were found dead Monday in a cargo
container aboard a freighter that arrived in a Tokyo port from
China, the coast guard said.
	   Officials believe the eight _ seven women and one man _ died of
dehydration and that they were Chinese who had been trying to enter
Japan illegally, said Maritime Safety Agency spokesman Takeshi
Noda.
	   They were discovered aboard the St. Vincent and the
Grenadines-registered Goldrich River, which left the Chinese port
of Dalian last week and arrived in Tokyo's Ohi pier Monday with a
cargo of artificial flowers.
	   Eight others found in the container were suffering from severe
dehydration and taken to a hospital. Their condition was not
immediately known, Noda said.
	   He said police searched the ship after coast guards were
informed stowaways may be aboard the ship.
	   The Goldrich River is owned by Goldrich Shipping Ltd. of Hong
Kong and operated by Japan's Kawasaki Kisen.
	   Last year, police arrested 7,117 foreigners, including 3,045
Chinese for trying to enter Japan illegally, nearly a fifty percent
rise from 1996, according to the immigration office.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A downtown electrical sub-station, newly
rebuilt since a fire last October caused dlrs 1 million damage,
exploded Sunday and blacked out much of Zimbabwe's capital and
causing widespread disruption due to power surges.
	   Many businesses Monday reported modems and other sensitive
telecommunication and computer equipment had blown and the
state-run Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corp. forecast long delays on
circuits this week as technicians try to effect repairs.
	   No one was hurt in Sunday's blaze at the sub-station adjoining
Harare Central Gardens when a newly rebuilt 20 kilovolt board burst
into flames, for reasons that had yet to be established. Firemmen
fought the blaze for more than an hour in dense billowing smoke.
	   Last Thursday Zimbabwe's links with the Internet and
international e-mail were severed for over 18 hours due to fault
experienced by the government-owned Posts and Telecommunications
Corp.
	   -----
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Peter Chanetsa, governor of Mashonaland
West province for President Robert Mugabe's ruling Zanu party, said
900 families of squatters had been evicted from commercial farms
owned by both blacks and whites in his area west of the capital.
	   Chanetsa told the official news agency Ziana Sunday: ``We are
not going to tolerate haphazard settlements from people who think
they can take the law into their own hands and illegally settle
themselves on land that does not belong to them.''
	   There were no reports of violence or unrest in the area, and
Ziana did not say whether force was used to persuade the squatters
to return to their homes.
	   Ziana said most came from ``resettlement areas'' -- former white
commercial farms taken over after 1980 independence on a voluntary
basis with British aid monies, and redistributed to peasants.
	   Ziana said the squatters complained the resettlement farms were
now inadequate and alleged officials were soliciting bribes to
allocate new land under Mugabe's plan to redistribute 1,400
commercial farms in the next five years.
	   A spate of squatter invasions of commercial farms has followed
unveiling of the plan, which Mugabe says will go ahead whether or
not western donors pledge funds to compensate white owners. Support
is being sought at a conference here, scheduled for next month.
	   -----
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's leader is on a tour of the
country's southwest, where he is meeting with soldiers to discuss
his plan to end military rule in May 1999.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar was warmly welcomed by officers when he
arrived in Lagos on Saturday. On Monday, he was to visit the city
of Ibadan where he will meet with state military administrators.
	   Abubakar will be discussing ``the policy thrust of his new
government and the transition program,'' said a statement released
by the army.
	   Lagos has long been the base of Nigeria's pro-democracy movement
and Abubakar's predecessor, Gen. Sani Abacha, made very few visits
to the city during his five years in power.
	   Unlike Abacha's visits, security was not notably tighter in
Lagos during Abubakar's stay.
	   Abacha died of an apparent heart attack in early June. Abubakar
has pledged to return his country to civilian rule next year.
	   Nigeria has been ruled by soldiers for all but 10 years since
independence from Britain in 1960.
	   -----
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A hearing to determine whether the
suspended chief of the Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority is competent
to perform his duties opened Monday and served John Huron Mwau with
a copy of the allegations against him.
	   President Daniel Arap Moi suspended Mwau last month after he
sought and obtained arrest warrants for four senior treasury and
tax officers whom he accused of failing to collect dlrs 3.8 million
in duties on imported wheat and sugar.
	   The warrants were revoked.
	   The president later set up a commission to look into Mwau's
suitability for the job to which Moi appointed him.
	   Commission chairman Rian'ga Omollo said the purpose of Monday's
pre-hearing was to make sure Mwau knew what the allegations against
him were.
	   The anti-graft unit was set up a year ago after the
International Monetary Fund suspended a dlrs 220 million loan to
Kenya because of the government's failure to deal with high-level
corruption.
	   ``At the end of this, I will come out as clean as ice,'' Mwau
said.
	   Omollo said the commission will hold its first hearing Aug. 26.
	   -----
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ An unusually stiff sentence for
illegal trade in rhino horn was handed on Friday to a 29-year-old
woman from Empangeni in KwaZulu-Natal, police said on Monday.
	   Endangered Species Protection Unit spokeswoman Captain Petronel
Niewoudt said Nomsa Charlotte Nkhwanazi was sentenced to four
years' imprisonment or a 60,000 rand (dlrs 10,000) fine in the
Durban Regional Court.
	   She was arrested in February this year after trying to sell a
rhino horn weighing 1.2 kilograms (2.5 pounds).

Israel approves plan to set up barriers along 1967 border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A government decision to set up barriers along
the invisible Green Line between Israel and the West Bank,
ostensibly to stop car thefts, could hurt Israel in negotiations
with the Palestinians, a deputy minister said Monday.
	   The Cabinet voted Sunday to erect the barriers, including
boulders, concrete walls and electronic devices, along stretches
totaling about 80 kilometers (50 miles) of the 324 kilometer-long
(200 mile) pre-1967 border between Israel and the West Bank.
	   Police estimate that a car is stolen in Israel every 12 seconds,
with many of the them ending up in Palestinian-controlled areas.
	   The future border between Israel and a Palestinian entity will
be the key issue once Israel and the Palestinians hold negotiations
on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Deputy Education Minister Moshe Peled said Monday that by
deciding to set up the barriers, Israel could preempt the outcome
of the negotiations.
	   ``We are throwing money away,'' Peled said. ``I am sure this
intelligent country can think up better ways to fight theft and
terror than re-making a non-existent border.''
	   Peled said the Cabinet decision would give the Palestinians
false hope that Israel might one day return all of the West Bank.
	   Yossi Sarid, a legislator from the dovish opposition Meretz
Party, said the Cabinet decision was final proof that the hardline
government had abandoned its claims to all of the West Bank.
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
War.

Russian Minister visits Angola to expand trade, cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Russia's Defense Minister arrived here
Monday for a three-day visit designed to deepen bilateral ties and
sign a five-year rearmament program for the Angolan armed forces.
	   ``We have no doubt that we can achieve our aims in the area of
military cooperation,'' Igor Sergeyev told reporters on his arrival
at Luanda airport.
	   He declined to give details of the rearmament plan.
	   Sergeyev's visit came as the United Nations is struggling to
keep a lid on the latest crisis in the implementation of the 1994
peace pact between the government and the former rebel movement
UNITA. The accord ended a two-decade civil war in this oil- and
diamond-rich nation.
	   The government has accused UNITA of attacking remote towns in
recent months, killing hundreds of civilians and police. UNITA
claims the government is preparing to launch a military strike
against towns still under rebel control.
	   Sergeyev was accompanied by a delegation of officials and
businessmen from the oil, diamond and fisheries sectors.
	   His visit was a follow-up to last June's meeting in Moscow
between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Angolan President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos.

Amid unrelenting financial turmoil, Russia lets ruble drop

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After spending billions of dollars over the past
three months to prop up Russia's weak currency, the government gave
up on Monday and let the ruble's value drop by up to 50 percent.
	   Russians have already been hit hard by the country's fiscal
troubles, which have robbed many of their salaries for months. The
sharp drop in the currency is an even harsher blow for
rank-and-file consumers, as it will vastly increase the prices of
imports that which account for a large percentage of Russian
consumer goods, including groceries.
	   Russia's 1,500 banks, will also suffer, and up to half are
expected to go belly-up in the next few weeks.
	   The government-sanctioned drop in the currency is likewise
expected to shake foreign investors, whose confidence in the
government's ability to overcome the crisis has already been
shrinking steadily. Prices on European markets dropped on the news
that the government would let the ruble's lower limit sink from 6.3
to 9.5 to the dollar.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko insisted that the ruble's new
lower limit did not constitute a devaluation _ the step that
government officials have sworn repeatedly they would not allow.
	   ``This is just a new approach to monetary policy,'' Kiriyenko
told reporters.
	   Nevertheless, the move was a concession of defeat in the one
area where Russia's often painful economic reforms had yielded an
achievement that financial analysts and consumers alike could feel:
keeping the ruble steady and inflation low.
	   But the price of defending this feat had become too high,
Kiriyenko and Central Bank President Sergei Dubinin said in a joint
statement explaining the government's new exchange rate policy.
	   The new rate ``will make it possible to ease the acuteness of
speculative attacks on the Russian ruble that have led to
unjustified spending of the currency reserves of the Bank of
Russia,'' the statement said.
	   Those reserves had dropped this month to about dlrs 17 billion _
even including last month's multibillion dollar loan from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   The government blamed the difficult economic situation on the
Asian financial crisis and a recent drop in the world price of oil,
Russia's biggest export earner. Already, the government has
introduced an austerity program to close the huge gap between
government revenues and spending, and secured a dlrs 22.6 billion
bailout from international organizations led by the IMF. But
sagging investor confidence hasn't improved.
	   President Boris Yeltsin, who had cut short his vacation and
returned to his country residence outside Moscow, decided Sunday to
let the ruble sink during a meeting with Kiriyenko and Anatoly
Chubais, the president's envoy to international lending
organizations, presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin and Kiriyenko also met on Monday to discuss the
government's strategy for battling the economic crisis, while
Chubais met with a delegation led by senior IMF negotiator John
Odling-Smee.
	   Immediate public reaction to the announcement was muted, with
some Russians approaching exchange booths only to turn back when
they saw the massive increase.
	   ``It was hard to survive before on my pension of 350 rubles a
month,'' said pensioner Yelena Bochet, 68. ``But now I simply don't
know what to do because all the prices will certainly soar.''
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov denounced the de facto
devaluation as a ``full-scale bankruptcy'' of Yeltsin's government.
	   A ruble devaluation had been widely rumored, in part because the
government faces heavy payments on ruble-denominated debt in coming
days and weeks. The government also said it would halt payment on
government treasury bills and impose a 90-day moratorium on
payments of foreign debt.
	   Chubais insisted that the government was not defaulting.
	   ``We are not reneging on our debts,'' he said. ``We realize that
many of our partners will feel uncomfortable, but any hesitation on
our part would cost them far more.''
	   The main currency exchange suspended dollar trades last week, so
it was not possible to fix a new market rate for the ruble. The
stock market opened 45 minutes late, but after an initial drop the
index was up slightly _ 0.19 percent _ by midday.
	   The drop in the ruble was also expected to lead to the collapse
of many Russian commercial banks, which are over-dependent on
now-devalued ruble assets. The government and Central Bank said
they would pool the resources of the country's 12 leading banks,
which account for the majority of the country's private deposits,
to limit the damage.

Bottled drinks banned from Everest region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ The Nepalese government on Monday banned
all bottled drinks from the Everest region to minimize littering on
the slopes of the world's highest peak.
	   Empty bottles left by climbers have been a main concern of
Nepali environmentalists for years. An average of 30,000 trekkers
each year are said to leave about 200,000 bottles of water, beer
and other beverages on the slopes.
	   Only drinks bottled in aluminum cans would be permitted in the
area as they can be crushed and easily carried back to the base,
and were good value for trash collectors, said Umesh Singh, an
official at the Nepalese Tourism Ministry.
	   Bottled beer and beverages are carried on yaks or by porters
from the base. Some stocks are flown in by helicopter.
	   But bringing the bottles back is expensive and the three rupees
(5 cents) offered by recyclers does not cover even a fraction of
the cost, officials say.
	   The ban will be imposed throughout the Everest region, which is
a national park, and will be monitored by the Everest Pollution
Control Committee, an agency funded by the ministry and the World
Wildlife Fund, Singh said. The Nepal Mountaineering Association
welcomed the ban.
	   Since the committee was established in 1991, it has urged local
hotel owners to help collect the trash. Bottles are brought to the
nearest airfield, sacked and flown to Katmandu by helicopter
operators free of charge whenever extra space is available.
	   The committee would impose the ban at Jorsalle, at 2,800 meters
(9,240 feet) above sea level, which is the only entry point into
the Everest area.

14 people killed in Kashmir

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Muslim militants killing four
civilians in Kashmir &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ A total of 14 people were killed in
troubled Kashmir on Monday in a clash between army troops and
Muslim separatist guerrillas and in rebel attacks on civilians,
Indian officials said.
	   Ten rebels were killed in an encounter shortly after midnight in
the dense forests in the Kupwara district, 140 kilometers (85
miles) north of summer capital Srinagar, said an army spokesman who
cannot be identified. There were no casualties among the soldiers.
	   In the same district, militants killed two brothers in their
home. Both were activists of the National Conference party, which
governs Jammu-Kashmir state, police said.
	   In a separate incident, militants abducted three civilians in
the Baramulla district after midnight and abandoned their bodies a
few hours later, said the police control room in Srinagar.
	   In the last 15 days, some 30 militants have been killed in
encounters in Kupwara district following an increase in patrolling
by troops.
	   Army and paramilitary soldiers have been fighting Muslim
guerrillas who demand an independent Kashmir. The insurrection,
which broke out in 1989, has left more than 16,000 people dead so
far.

Gadhafi meets with Tunisian president
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi met with
his Tunisian counterpart Zine el Abidine Ben Ali Monday for talks
on boosting relations between the two countries, Libyan television
reported.
	   Ben Ali, on the first visit by a Tunisian leader to Libya in
five years, received a red-carpet welcome by Libyan officials
outside the ruins of an apartment building that was bombed during
the 1987 U.S. air raids on Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
	   Gadhafi, who is recovering from hip surgery, did not attend the
welcoming reception which was headed by his aide, Major
al-Khuwaylidi al-Yumaydi, said the television broadcast, monitored
by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   Speaking to reporters, Ben Ali reaffirmed his country's
commitment to seeing U.N. sanctions on Libya lifted, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency said.
	   The United Nations imposed economic and political sanctions on
Libya in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans
wanted in connection with the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   The embargo, which bans air travel to the country and has frozen
Libyan assets abroad, has also punished Libya for supporting
international terrorism.
	   Ben Ali also said that he came to Libya to check on Gadhafi's
health after the July surgery to fix the Libyan leader's hip, which
he broke while exercising.
	   Gadhafi told reporters that the trip comes as part of continued
contacts between the two neighboring countries, MENA said.
	   Tunisia, which borders Libya on the east, is frequently used as
a land crossing into Libya due to the current sanctions.

Chief of Ukraine's State Savings Bank killed in car accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - The chief of one of Ukraine's largest banks
was killed in a car accident, a news agency reported Monday.
	   Oleksandr Veselovsky, who headed the managing board of the State
Savings Bank, died in a car accident Saturday together with a few

Parliament commission resumes hearings for impeaching Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin's parliamentary foes on Monday sent
an invitation to former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to
testify before a commission trying to impeach the president, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The Communist-led opposition in the lower house of parliament,
the State Duma, has accused Yeltsin of instigating the collapse of
the Soviet Union. The impeachment campaign started long before
Russia's latest, unfolding financial crisis.
	   The commission has also invited former Presidents Leonid
Kravchuk of Ukraine and Stanislav Shushkevich of Belarus, who
together with Yeltsin signed the 1991 agreement declaring the
Soviet Union defunct and creating the Commonwealth of Independent
States, a loose coalition of former Soviet republics. Neither has
responded, said commission chairman Vadim Filimonov.
	   Gorbachev was leader of the Soviet Union at that time. Yeltsin,
who was then head of the Russian republic, Kravchuk and Shushkevich
effectively sidestepped Gorbachev by signing the agreement, which
also made Gorbachev's job moot.
	   Communist lawmakers call Yeltsin's action high treason, claiming
that Russia lost much of its wealth and military might in the
Soviet collapse. Supporters of the impeachment motion also accuse
Yeltsin of launching the botched war in Chechnya, ruining Russia's
economy and military, and using troops and tanks against his foes
in the former Russian parliament in October 1993.
	   Several previous attempts to oust Yeltsin have failed, and this
initiative is expected to meet the same fate.
	   Russia's constitution gives the president a strong hand in
confrontations with parliament. The constitution is vague on the
grounds for which a president can be impeached, citing only treason
and grave misconduct.
	   An impeachment motion would also require approval from both the
Constitutional and Supreme Courts, as well as the upper chamber of
parliament _ a body made up of regional leaders, most of whom are
loyal to Yeltsin.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Most U.S. Embassy personnel were
leaving Pakistan and other Americans were urged to join them Monday
after a suspect in the East African embassy bombings was caught in
Pakistan and turned over to Kenyan authorities.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland said all but about 50 of
the total contingent of about 120 in the embassy in Islamabad and
consulates in Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar would leave under
security orders from the State Department. They, their families and
the families of essential staff will begin leaving Tuesday, he
said.
	   ``American citizens currently in Pakistan are urged ... to
consider seriously departing Pakistan,'' the embassy added in a
statement. It noted airports were open and commercial flights
available, but added the embassy was arranging additional flights.
	   About 6,700 Americans live in Pakistan, according to embassy
figures. The heightened security warning was valid for a month, and
could be renewed.
	   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Simons said there had been no specific
threat against U.S. citizens in Pakistan.
	   The evacuation ``has to do with a range of perceived threats,''
he said.
	   Embassy staff were considered most at risk given the nearly
simultaneous explosions in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania on Aug. 7 that killed a total of 257 people.
	   Simons said the evacuation was not linked to the transfer
Pakistani officials reported Sunday of a suspect in the embassy
bombings.
	   In a brief statement Sunday, Pakistani Foreign Ministry
spokesman Tariq Altaf said a man who arrived at the Karachi airport
from Nairobi on the day of the bombings attracted the attention of
immigration officials because he did not match the photograph on
his Yemeni passport.
	   Altaf said he was interrogated by Pakistani officials who
determined he had some link to the African bombings and handed him
over to Kenyan authorities.
	   U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents and Kenya's Criminal
Investigations Division confirmed Monday they were questioning the
suspect, identified as Mohammed Saddiq Odeh. The FBI and CID said
Odeh had two aliases: Abdull Bast Awadh and Mohammad Sadiq Howaida.
	   Also Monday, a Pakistani border official said a Saudi and a
Sudanese were stopped at the Afghan border Saturday when
immigration officials discovered they had no identity papers.
	   Bakhtiar Khan, chief of the Pakistani border post near the
northern city of Peshawar, said a team of army and civilian
investigators were interrogating the two to determine if they had
any links to the African bombings.
	   The News, a national Pakistani newspaper, quoted unnamed
government sources Monday as saying Odeh claimed the attack was
sponsored by Osama bin Laden, a Saudi living in neighboring
Afghanistan whom U.S. officials have identified as a possible
suspect in the bombings.
	   Bin Laden has been vocal in his hatred of what he sees as U.S.
imperialism and has pledged to drive U.S. troops out of bases in
places like his native Saudi Arabia.
	   A spokesman for Afghanistan's Taliban militia told The
Associated Press Monday that bin Laden, who has pledged not to
engage in such activities while living under Taliban protection had
nothing to do with the bombings.
	   The Pakistani government had tried to conceal U.S. involvement
in Odeh's transfer to Kenya, perhaps because of the case of Mir
Aimal Kasi, the Pakistani convicted of killing two CIA employees
during a shooting spree in Virginia in 1993.
	   When Kasi was arrested in Pakistan in June 1997 in a joint
FBI-Pakistani operation, angry Pakistanis accused their government
of groveling before U.S. power.
	   Americans in Pakistan have been advised to be on the alert since
last November, when four American oil workers were gunned down in
the southern port city of Karachi following Kasi's conviction. In
March, cement barricades were erected on the roads leading to the
high-walled U.S. Embassy compound in Islamabad.

Gurkhas protest outside British Embassy demanding hike in pension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nearly 300 retired Gurkha soldiers sat
outside the British Embassy Monday at the start of a three-day
protest to demand pensions at par with British ex-servicemen.
	   The Gurkhas waved banners and placards demanding an ``end to
discrimination.'' Their monthly pension is 16 times less than what
a retired British soldier gets.
	   They plan to continue their daytime protest until Wednesday,
said Krishna Rai of Gurkha Ex-Servicemen's Organization.
	   The organization rejected a recent 23-51 percent hike ordered by
the British government for 26,375 retired Gurkha soldiers. After
the latest increase, the pension for a retired Gurkha rifleman
would be dlrs 42 a month, compared with dlrs 750 for a British
soldier.
	   Nearly 3,000 Nepalese Gurkhas are still serving the British
army. Gurkha soldiers from Nepal have served in the British Army
for nearly 200 years.

Kabila heads back to Lubumbashi, power cut in Kinshasa

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Traipsing from Cuba to southern Congo and
into neighboring Angola, President Laurent Kabila has been mounting
a last minute drive to rally support for his embattled government,
threatened by an advancing rebel army.
	   Over the weekend, Kabila met with Angolan President Jose Eduardo
Dos Santos to ask for arms and troops to help hold off the rebel
force that reportedly has closed to within 200 kilometers (125
miles) of Kinshasa.
	   A senior Kabila adviser familiar with his trip Angola said
Monday that the meetings were cordial, but would not disclose the
outcome.
	   Late last month, during a surprise visit to Cuba, Kabila
apparently did the same, a former military intelligence officer
with close ties to the government told The Associated Press on
condition of anonymity.
	   Kabila returned briefly Sunday to Kinshasa, but reboarded his
presidential jet and went to the southern city of Lubumbashi _ his
former rebel stronghold.
	   Angolan troops, along with former Rwandan and Ugandan allies,
helped Kabila in his march across this vast central African country
last year to oust longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko. Angolan
soldiers also played a key role last year in helping Gen. Denis
Sassou-Nguesso seize control of the neighboring Republic of Congo.
	   The outcome of both the Cuban and Angolan meetings was unclear,
but the former intelligence officer said they were part of an
effort by the president to find troops, arms and other supplies for
his crippled military.
	   One report indicates Kabila may have ordered or purchased a MiG
fighter jet while in Cuba.
	   Rwandan Tutsi troops _ once the core of Kabila's military _
defected en mass to join an ethnic Tutsi-led rebellion against his
government. Just days before the rebellion began, Kabila had
ordered all the Rwandans out of his country.
	   ``Kabila had learned of an assassination plot against him that
was being planned by the Rwandans,'' the former intelligence
officer said.
	   The president, with his 15-month-old regime in jeopardy, made an
unannounced visit to the Cuban capital of Havana last month. Days
after his return, he fired Col. James Kabari _ a Rwandan soldier
and Kabila's top commander _ and ordered all Rwanda troops out of
the country.
	   Rwandan troops played an instrumental role in helping Kabila
oust Mobutu. Disaffected and acting on their government's concern
that Kabila had done little to secure the turbulent eastern border
region, the Rwandans revolted in their barracks in Kinshasa and
teamed up with other disgruntled Tutsi rebels to stage a rebellion
against the president.
	   His former Rwandan and Ugandan allies gone, Kabila is now
turning to old friends in Angola and Cuba for help.
	   While a guerrilla warrior in the jungles of southern Congo in
the 1960s, Kabila briefly recruited the support of legendary rebel
leader Ernesto ``Che'' Guevara.
	   That rebellion failed, and his new regime appears in jeopardy as
well.
	   On Monday, Kabila has left his embattled capital for the second
time in a week and headed to the southern city of Lubumbashi.
	   State television has repeatedly shown Kabila arriving at
Kinshasa's airport, smiling and defiantly denouncing the rebels.
	   What state broadcasters did not mention was that Kabila quickly
reboarded his jet and headed back to Lubumbashi, where he spent
much of last week, a senior government minister told The Associated
Press on condition of anonymity.
	   ``The president is back in Lubumbashi, but he said he would be
returning to Kinshasa tonight,'' the official said.
	   By Monday afternoon, electricity was also lost throughout
Kinshasa _ the second time since the rebels began their advance two
weeks ago. It was not immediate clear what caused the outage.
	   The loss of power cut off state radio and television.
	   Before the electricity failed, state radio had been repeatedly
broadcast Kabila saying his government will arm the people and
prevail against a rebel movement of ethnic Tutsi fighters, Rwandan
soldiers and disenchanted members of the president' own military.
	   He also lashed out at the international community and accused
the West of plotting against his government.
	   The rebels have been making steady progress toward the capital,
a western diplomat said on condition of anonymity.
	   Many in the rebel movement helped Kabila oust longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997, but now say they have been
marginalized by the government.
	   A diplomat in Kinshasa said he had received reports from his
government that the rebels were now near the town of Mbanza-Ngungu,
about 150 kilometers (95 miles) south of the capital.
	   Kabila said Congo was the victim of a plot by neighboring Rwanda
_ which he says is orchestrating the rebellion _ along with the
West.
	   ``The next 24 hours will be decisive,'' Kabila said. ``We must
understand that we must win. This is the message I have for my
people, I am asking them to face up to this plot, to arm
themselves, to support their army, and to defeat the aggressors.''
	   Hundreds of westerners left Kinshasa over the weekend, while a
team of 50 British commandos has been deployed to Brazzaville, the
capital of the neighboring Republic of Congo, to help the
evacuation of British subjects if need be.
	   French troops already in Brazzaville helped hundreds of French,
Belgian and other foreigners cross the river on Saturday.
	   Despite apparent military setbacks, the Congolese government
said Sunday that it was securing bases across the country to attack
rebel forces.
	   Kabila's government has drawn support from the public in
Kinshasa by characterizing the rebel movement as a Rwandan Tutsi
war against Congo. Rwanda denies the charge.
	   Tutsis, an ethnic minority centered in eastern Congo and
neighboring countries, including Rwanda, have become the target of
attacks and arbitrary detentions in Kinshasa.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Spain's deputy prime minister
flew to Northern Ireland on Monday to visit the Spanish victims of
the deadly bombing in Omagh and to express solidarity with the
local community.
	   Two of the 28 people killed in the Saturday bombing were
Spanish.
	   Francisco Alvarez Cascos arrived at Aldergrove air force base
from Madrid shortly after relatives of the injured Spaniards
touched down. A third aircraft carrying medical staff also arrived
at the base on the outskirts of Belfast to transport the injured
who are well enough to travel back to Madrid later in the day.
	   Police identified the slain Spaniards as Ricio Abad Ramos, 23,
of Victor De La Serra, Madrid, and Fernando Blasco Baselga, 12,
Arturo Sorita, Madrid. They were part of a group on an exchange
trip to Northern Ireland. Ten other members were injured in the
blast.
	   ``My presence here is to be with the families, meeting all these
people injured in the hospital and being able to accompany families
taking casualties back,'' Alvarez Cascos said.
	   ``I would like to be at the place of the terrorist bombing and
express with my presence the solidarity of the community enduring
this situation, and who have been affected by terrorism for so
long,'' he said in Spanish. his remarks were interpreted by Alberto
Aza, Spanish ambassador to Britain.
	   ``Terrorist activities all over the world have something in
common. They are the activities of fanatical, mad people,'' he
said. ``There are always minority groups. They are savage and
cowards.''

Wives of missing soldiers try to dig up grave of unknown soldier

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Desperate for clues, wives of two Greek
Cypriot soldiers missing since the 1974 Turkish invasion tried to
exhume the bodies of two unidentified soldiers Monday in a military
cemetery.
	   They had dug two feet (60 centimeters) down when police arrived
and dragged them away as they wailed.
	   ``We have been waiting for 24 years to find out about the fate
of our loved ones, but nobody bothers,'' said Maroula Shamishi, one
of the two middle aged women. Both women wore black dresses in sign
of mourning.
	   ``We will do this again until the government does something to
settle the drama of the families of the missing,'' said the other
woman, Maroula Palma.
	   The grave is one of several in the cemetery marked ``unknown
soldiers.''
	   A total of 1,609 Greek Cypriots and 700 Turkish Cypriots are
listed as missing in the wake of the 1974 invasion and earlier
intercommunal clashes. The island has been split into a Greek
Cypriot-controlled south and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974. A
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is only recognized by
Turkey which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   A Missing Persons Committee from both communities and chaired by
a representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross
has been meeting for years without having been able to trace the
missing.
	   Many Greek Cypriots disappeared after being listed by the Red
Cross as prisoners of war held in camps in Turkey, leading
relatives to believe their loved ones may still be alive.
	   The committee agreed last year to the simultaneous opening of
mass graves and other burial sites in both communities and to try
to identify the remains through DNA tests. But the operation has
been delayed by Turkish reluctance to implement the agreement.
	   A U.S. Congressional mission, which visited the occupied north
two years ago to determine the fate of five missing Greek
Cypriot-American citizens, succeeded in tracing the grave of one of
them.

Bubka, Perec notable absences; Drechsler goes for 4th straight

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Russian pole vaulter Maksim Tarasov is
here. But, in the absence at the European Championships of his
great rival Sergey Bubka, he doesn't sound that enthused about it.
	   Bubka, the world record-holder and a six-time world champion
outdoors, will be the most notable no-show _ along with French
Olympic champion Marie-Jose Perec _ when the six-day Euros open
Tuesday.
	   ``I've never done the Europeans, only the world championships
since I was a junior,'' said Tarasov, who should be among the
favorites with French Olympic champion Jean Galfione. ``I live in
Budapest, so that's a reason I'm here.''
	   ``Apparently the Europeans aren't that interesting, there is no
money,'' added the '92 Olympic champion and silver medalist in last
year's worlds behind Bubka. ``I don't do the European indoors
either.''
	   ``I still want to save my best for the end of the season. I hope
you haven't seen my best yet.''
	   Bubka is skipping these championships because he said they
didn't figure in his training schedule. Perec is out because of a
reported squabble with the French track federation.
	   The field includes more than 1,300 athletes from 44 countries
with Germany fielding the largest team (123) followed by France
(103), Russia (101), Italy (83), Hungary (80) and Spain (76).
	   With North American men dominating this season's sprints and the
Africans cleaning up in the distance races, the men's side here
seems weak with most of the world-class performances expected in
the field events _ particularly the high jump, triple jump and the
strength events.
	   The women are stronger. With the exception of the sprints, they
figure prominently among the world leaders this season in most
events.
	   The most-watched woman will be Germany's 33-year-old long jumper
Heike Drechsler, who is trying to equal the European record of four
straight gold medals in one event, which has been done by two
others, Janis Lusis in the javelin, 1962-1971, and Nadezhda
Chizhova in the shot put, 1966-74.
	   She looks in good shape to do it, coming off a jump of 7.05
(23-1 3/4) last week in Zurich. She also has a wind-assisted 7.12
(23-4 1/2) this season, her longest jump since winning the European
title four years ago.
	   Drechsler, coming off operations on both Achilles tendons 10
months ago, is free of injuries for the first time in three years.
	   ``I've got my confidence back, and that was on of my aims for
1998,'' she said.
	   The top challenge will come from British-born Italian Fiona May,
the '96 Olympic silver medalist who has gone 7.08 (23-2 3/4) this
season.
	   Four others will be after their third consecutive European golds
_ British hurdler Colin Jackson and javelin thrower Steve Backley,
and Germans Sabine Braun (heptathlon) and Ilke Wyludda (discus).
	   The British men will probably benefit most not having the North
American sprinters around. That's particularly true in the 400,
where Britain could finish 1-2-3 with Mark Richardson, Iwan Thomas
and Solomon Wariso.
	   ``The competition in Britain is stiff, and that's good. On the
other side, it's too bad only three could come here,'' he said,
referring to two-time European champion and Olympic silver medalist
Roger Black, who failed to make the British team.
	   ``One shouldn't read too much into the results so far,'' said
Thomas, who has beaten Richardson only once this season. ``I've
been experimenting a lot.''
	   ``The track (in Budapest) is not all that fast, but the European
record (44.33) could go if we have a good race.''
	   The most interesting local rivalry will be '96 Olympic hammer
throw champion Balazs Kiss against Hungarian countryman Tibor
Gecsek, who is returing from a two-year drug ban.
	   One of Europe's most decorated women Fernanda Ribeiro of
Portugal will defend her 10,000 title, an event where she's also
the '96 Olympic champion and '95 world champion. She's has the
world's best time this year (30:48.06), just ahead of Britain's
Paula Radcliffe (30:48.58).

Wives of missing soldiers try to dig up grave of unknown soldier

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Desperate for clues, wives of two Greek
Cypriot soldiers missing since the 1974 Turkish invasion tried to
exhume the bodies of two unidentified soldiers Monday in a military
cemetery.
	   They had dug two feet (60 centimeters) down when police arrived
and dragged them away as they wailed.
	   ``We have been waiting for 24 years to find out about the fate
of our loved ones, but nobody bothers,'' said Maroula Shamishi, one
of the two middle aged women. Both women wore black dresses in sign
of mourning.
	   ``We will do this again until the government does something to
settle the drama of the families of the missing,'' said the other
woman, Maroula Palma.
	   The grave is one of several in the cemetery marked ``unknown
soldiers.''
	   A total of 1,609 Greek Cypriots and 700 Turkish Cypriots are
listed as missing in the wake of the 1974 invasion and earlier
intercommunal clashes. The island has been split into a Greek
Cypriot-controlled south and a Turkish-occupied north since 1974. A
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north is only recognized by
Turkey which maintains 35,000 troops there.
	   A Missing Persons Committee from both communities and chaired by
a representative of the International Committee of the Red Cross
has been meeting for years, but has yet to trace the missing.
	   Many Greek Cypriots disappeared after being listed by the Red
Cross as prisoners of war held in camps in Turkey, leading
relatives to believe their loved ones may still be alive.
	   The committee agreed last year to the simultaneous opening of
mass graves and other burial sites in both communities and to try
to identify the remains through DNA tests. But the operation has
been delayed by Turkish reluctance to implement the agreement.
	   A U.S. Congressional mission, which visited the occupied north
two years ago to determine the fate of five missing Greek
Cypriot-American citizens, succeeded in tracing the grave of one of
them.

Romanian star set to leave Chelsea

Petrescu possibly headed to Ajax

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Romanian international Dan Petrescu looks set to
become the first foreign casualty at Chelsea as Gianluca Vialli
tries to balance the budget after splashing out 12 million pounds
(dlrs 19.7 million) on players during the off-season.
	   Petrescu, who scored the winning goal in Romania's victory over
England in a World Cup group match this summer, was not named in
Chelsea's squad for its season opener against Conventry on
Saturday.
	   Chelsea, which fielded nine foreign players in its starting 11,
lost the game 2-1.
	   Vialli told the 30-year-old defender he was free to leave
Stamford Bridge, the Express newspaper reported Monday.
	   ``I am very sad,'' Petrescu was quoted as saying. ``Chelsea want
to sell me. Vialli said I will not be playing in the first XI this
year. If can find a club to go to, I will leave.''
	   Chelsea managing director Colin Hutchinson said Dutch club Ajax
had expressed interest in Petrescu.
	   ``We will not stand in the way but Ajax have not yet made a
formal bid,'' he said.
	   Hutchinson said Petrescu, who has played 100 games for Chelsea,
was one of the players for which the Blues were prepared to
consider an offer.
	   Chelsea, which has an annual salary bill exceeding 23 million
pounds (dlrs 37.4 million), was reportedly considering a 2.5
million pound (dlrs 4.1 million) offer from Ajax.
	   Veteran Welsh international Mark Hughes was the first
high-profile departure from Stamford Bridge after the Chelsea boss
signed Brian Laudrup, Pierluigi Casiraghi, Albert Ferrer and Marcel
Desailly in the off-season.
	   Hughes, who signed with Chelsea in 1995 _ the same year as
Petrescu _ transfered to Southampton.
	   Other 1997-98 first team regulars to leave this season include
Frank Sinclair and Danny Granville.
	   Petrescu, who was in Bucharest this week, has also been linked
with moves to Read Madrid. He has 60 caps for Romania. He played 31
games for Chelsea last season and scored five goals.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Adventurer Steve Fossett's dream of
flying his balloon nonstop around the world turned into a nightmare
Monday as lightning storms and hail knocked him out of the sky and
sent him crashing into the South Pacific.
	   The schooner Atlanta picked up the U.S. millionaire-adventurer
Monday night from the Coral Sea about 500 miles (800 kilometers)
off Australia's east coast, New Zealand Defense Force spokesman
Bill Morley said.
	   Fossett was safe aboard the 60-foot (18 meter) Atlanta and was
expected to be taken aboard the New Zealand navy tanker HMNZS
Endeavour within a few hours, Morley said.
	   Nearby rescue ships and planes had stood guard as Fossett bobbed
in a life raft dropped Monday morning by a French air-sea rescue
plane sent from Noumea, New Caledonia.
	   Fossett was in regular radio contact with a Royal Australian Air
Force Hercules C-130, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority
said.
	   ``The rescue was very straight-forward. Mr. Fossett is in good
health and given that he is out of danger, they might proceed to
Townsville (Australia) tonight,'' Authority spokesman Brian Hill
said.
	   After drifting swiftly around two-thirds of the world nonstop,
Fossett's balloon Solo Spirit was ripped by a violent lightning
storm.
	   ``He said he was caught in a giant thunderstorm with hail and
lightning which actually ruptured his balloon,'' said Darren Curtis
from Australia's TV 7 Network, aboard the Australian Hercules
C-130.
	   ``He says when he hit the ocean his balloon capsule caught fire
and he had to evacuate into a tiny life raft,'' Curtis said, after
talking to Fossett via the plane's radio.
	   Fossett said it was a wild ride from his initial altitude of
29,000 feet to the water.
	   ``Amazing,'' he said in an interview with Curtis. ``Tremendous
sheets of hail just flooding me and my greatest descent rate on
altimeter was 25,000 feet a minute.''
	   At Solo Spirit balloon mission control in St. Louis, Missouri,
media control spokesman Alan Blount said the rate of descent
described by Fossett would amount to dropping at a rate of almost
45 miles (72 kilometers) per hour.
	   ``He is fortunate. There are not too many of us around that have
been in a storm like that,'' said Blount.
	   Mission Control had alerted Australian authorities at 1 a.m.
Monday (1500 GMT Sunday) that Fossett's emergency beacon had been
activated in the Coral Sea.
	   But his splashdown in the wreckage of the Solo Spirit among
uncharted coral reefs near the Chesterfield Islands meant rescue
ships had to navigate cautiously after sunset.
	   The first boat to arrive was the Australian yacht Atlanta, whose
skipper Laurie Piper negotiated the maze of reefs in darkness.
	   Fosset had not yet
	   Solo Spirit Mission Control director Alan Blount said a severe
thunderstorm system that showered 10,000 lightning strikes over the
Coral Sea most likely caused the crash landing.
	   Fossett had dreaded the possibility of ditching at sea.
	   ``An ocean landing would be very scary,'' he said before setting
off from Argentina 10 days ago in his bid to be the first to fly a
balloon around the world nonstop.
	   About five hours before Fossett's warning locator sounded,
meteorologist Bob Rice had cautioned the balloonist he was
approaching strong thunderstorms _ and that they would be nearly
impossible to avoid.
	   Fossett had a long stretch of the Pacific Ocean between
Australia and Argentina to go and had at least another five days of
travel before he was expected to reach South America, where he left
from on Aug. 7.
	   He had traveled 15,200 miles (24,460 km) when he crashed.
	   The 54-year-old Fossett, from Chicago, was making his fourth
attempt to fly around the world. He has also run marathons, climbed
mountains and raced in the Iditarod dog sled race in Alaska.

	   Ben Ali, on the first visit by a Tunisian leader to Libya in
five years, received a red-carpet welcome by Libyan officials
outside the ruins of an apartment building that was bombed during
the 1987 U.S. air raids on Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
	   Gadhafi, who is recovering from hip surgery, did not attend the
welcoming reception said the television broadcast, monitored by the
British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   Speaking to reporters, Ben Ali reaffirmed his country's
commitment to seeing U.N. sanctions on Libya lifted, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency said.
	   The United Nations imposed economic and political sanctions on
Libya in 1992 to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans wanted in
connection with the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie,
Scotland, that killed 270 people. So far, he has resisted.
	   The embargo, banning air travel to the country and freezing
Libyan assets abroad, also aims to punish Libya for supporting
international terrorism.
	   The sanctions have increased land crossings from Libya into
Tunisia, which borders Libya on the east.

Defense ministers arrive to discuss Congo Kinshasa crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new graf 4 with Zimbabwe spokesman saying Kabila
not expected; no pickup

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Defense ministers from Namibia and
Angola arrived here Monday for talks on the civil war in Congo, the
official news agency Ziana said.
	   ``There are no new developments yet, but the ministers want to
find a lasting solution to the crisis which seemingly is
deepening,'' a government official told Ziana.
	   The agency quoted ``government sources'' as saying they had
arrived for talks with their counterpart from Zimbabwe. A
representative of President Laurent Kabila's government had yet to
arrive.
	   Kabila is defense minister, but a spokesman for Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe said he was not aware that Kabila planned
to come.
	   Earlier reports had said foreign ministers of Namibia, Tanzania,
Zambia and Zimbabwe would gather here to report back on the peace
initiative launched earlier this month by the Southern African
Development Community.
	   However, Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge on Monday was
said to be in the Great Lakes region, studying Kabila's allegations
that Rwanda is backing the mutiny by fellow Tutsi ethnic group
soldiers.
	   Ziana quoted government sources that Monday's scheduled defense
ministers' meeting was a follow-up to the Victoria Falls summit
chaired by Mugabe.
	   Kabila met over the weekend with Namibia's President Sam Nujoma
and Angola's President Eduardo dos Santos in Luanda, repeating
requests for military assistance he made to Mugabe here in early
July, according to news reports.

Russia's lower chamber of parliament to meet Friday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's lower house of parliament decided Monday
to hold two emergency sessions to debate the government's austerity
measures, a news agency said.
	   The chamber, known as the State Duma, will discuss an array of
bills, including amendments to tax, pension, and financial
insolvency laws, on Friday and on Aug. 25, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said, citing the Duma's press service.
	   The proposals are part of the government's austerity package,
designed to boost income to Russia's empty coffers and put an end
to months of economic slide. The parliament has stalled on many key
bills, but top government officials are demanding they be reviewed.
	   Duma leaders agreed to call the meetings after the government
let the national currency, the ruble, lose 50 percent of its value
Monday. The exchange rate on the streets rose from around 6.4
rubles to the dollar to around 9.5 rubles to the dollar early in
the day, then slid back to 8-8.5.
	   Parliament's upper house, the Federation Council, said it would
meet on Aug. 28 to debate any bills that the Duma may have passed
by that time, ITAR-Tass said.

Illegal immigrants set fire in escape attempt at Sicilian detention

<TEXT>
	   POZZALLO, Italy (AP) _ Authorities had 13 illegal immigrants
under arrest Monday after the men allegedly set fire to their
sheets and mattresses in a chaotic attempt to escape a detention
center on Italy's southern island of Sicily.
	   Three of the immigrants were recovering from smoke inhalation;
another man sustained a broken wrist and another a cut in Sunday's
escape attempt, Italy's ANSA news agency said.
	   The unrest started when one of the men drank shampoo with the
idea of distracting guards with a faked illness so the immigrants
could make their escape, news reports said. Once in an ambulance,
the man kicked out a window; others started the fire and tried to
force a gate at the center.
	   None of the immigrants succeeded in getting away from the center
at Pozzallo, a community on Sicily's southern coast. ANSA said the
arrested men were believed to be 11 Moroccans and two Algerians.
	   Also Monday, police detained 45 illegal immigrants thought to
have newly landed in Italy's southeastern region of Puglia, across
the Adriatic from Yugoslavia. Thirteen were believed to be Iraqi
Kurds; the rest apparently were ethnic Albanians, including women,
children and others from the embattled Yugoslav province of Kosovo,
ANSA said.
	   Police in Puglia arrested another 166 immigrants in a crackdown
on illegal workers, ANSA said.
	   Italy has been trying to better control its borders, in part at
the insistence of northern countries where many of the illegal
immigrants wind up. A new law lets authorities detain illegal
immigrants for up to 30 days, but officials frequently are unable
to process them for deportation within that time. Authorities then
resort to handing the immigrants expulsion papers warning they face
arrest if they don't leave the country on their own.
	   Many Italian politicians now are calling for tougher measures.
On Monday, Giampaolo Bettamio of the opposition Forza Italia said
the time had come to institute a European coast guard.

 &UR; Omagh blast condemnations continue as do calls to pursue peace
process &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The bomb in Omagh that killed 28 and
wounded 220 drew more condemnations worldwide Monday along with
pleas that it must not derail the Ulster peace process.
	   European Commission President Jacques Santer issued a statement
expressing his ``very deep shock and dismay ... We extend our
deepest sympathy to all the families and friends of those killed,''
he said on behalf of the 20-member EU executive Commission.
	   ``We believe unequivocally that supporting the peace process is
the only way forward toward lasting peace and reconciliation'' in
Northern Ireland, he added.
	   Others reacted similarly.
	   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl expressed sympathy for the victims
and relatives of the weekend bombing in a letter of condolence to
British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
	   ``The answer to this can only be to intensify the peace and
healing process.'' Kohl wrote.
	   Half a world away, the government in Beijing condemned the blast
saying, ``We were shocked by the serious bombing on August 15. The
Chinese government opposes and condemns all forms of terrorist
acts.''
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said in a statement
through the official Xinhua News Agency that Beijing hoped Britain,
Ireland and parties in Northern Ireland will push ahead with an
April peace agreement.
	   ``An early and lasting peace ... will fully accord with the best
interests of all concerned,'' the statement added.
	   The Geneva-based Council of Churches denounced Saturday's blast
as an ``unspeakable crime (that has) appalled people throughout
Europe and other parts of the world who have the cause of peace in
Northern Ireland in their hearts and prayers.''
	   The Council said that to many people the road to a peace in
Ulster ``may now seem still more difficult and perilous (but) it is
our hope and prayer that the people and their leaders will remain
firm in their commitment to pursue peace by negotiation.''

River breaches dike, threatening China's largest oil field

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Despite day and night sandbagging by thousands of
soldiers, a rain-swollen river breached a dike Monday, threatening
to inundate China's largest oil field.
	   The flooded Nen River pounded a 50-meter-wide (50-yard-wide) gap
in the embankment, the second of three lines of defense for the
Daqing oil field and the northeastern city of 2.3 million people of
the same name, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   China's northeastern regional military command urgently sent
10,000 more soldiers to the area, doubling the number of troops
already there fighting floods, Xinhua said.
	   To the south, in central China, the Yangtze River reached a new
record height of 45.22 meters (149.2 feet) Monday morning at Shashi
city, home to a half million people.
	   Officials earlier warned that if the river went over 45 meters
(148.5 feet) dikes might be dynamited to deliberately flood an area
south of Shashi and safeguard cities down river. But water levels
began falling later Monday.
	   ``There's been a turn for the better,'' said a flood control
official who gave his surname, Xu. He predicted the water would not
rise so high to make destroying dikes necessary.
	   Official reports sounded less certain. On a visit to Shashi,
Vice Premier Wen Jiabao, the senior most government official in
charge of flood control, told state television that dikes
downstream were undergoing ``a great historical trial.''
	   Xinhua said 335,000 people had been moved out of Hubei's
Jingjiang area in case a diversion was necessary.
	   This summer's floods are the Yangtze's worst in 44 years, with
more than 2,000 people killed. Some 2.7 million civilians and
soldiers worked on embankments of the river to protect farms and
cities from floods.
	   Water levels on the Yangtze's mid-reaches have stood above the
danger mark for 50 days, Xinhua said. Upstream, in Sichuan
province, more heavy rains brought landslides last week that buried
20 people in Suining city, the news agency said in a separate
report.
	   Near the Daqing oil field, 1,000 kilometers (600 miles)
northeast of Beijing, the second of three dikes collapsed Saturday.
Soldiers worked round-the-clock to pile sandbags two meters (six
feet) high along a five-kilometer (three-mile) embankment by
Monday, Xinhua said. But their efforts fell short.
	   Raging waters pushed through the dike Sunday, opening a more
than 10-meter (yard) hole, and by noon Monday the gap had widened
to 50 meters (yards), Xinhua said.
	   China's two most senior generals, Zhang Wannian and Chi Haotian,
telephoned the northeast region's military commander and ordered
him to ensure the safety of the Daqing oil field, Xinhua said.
	   Flooding at Daqing closed 527 oil wells, reducing output by more
than 2 million gallons (7.6 million liters) last week. Daqing has
25,000 wells that produced 17.9 billion gallons (68 billion liters)
of oil last year, about a third of the nation's total.
	   The partial collapse of the second dike Saturday forced the
evacuation of more than 2,000 people.
	   ``I heard people start to scream and run around blindly when
they learned the dike was breached,'' the China Daily quoted Liu
Hai, a farmer living 3 kilometers (two miles) from the second dike,
as saying.
	   Although Xinhua said the Nen had yet to reach the Daqing wells,
the third dike marked a ``life-and-death defense'' for Daqing, the
official China Daily quoted Wang Yang, an army captain in charge of
the dike, as saying.
	   In Inner Mongolia in north China, authorities were trying to
rescue 76,000 people stranded by the flooded Ulyji Muren River,
Xinhua said. About 70,000 other people cut off by the river had
been rescued, it said.
	   Rescuers also moved 52 Siberian tigers from a breeding and
research center near Harbin, the capital of Heilongjiang province
east of Daqing, to another station of the center 250 kilometers
(150 miles) away.
	   The tiger preserve, a tourist attraction, is near the Songhua
River, which is expected to crest at Harbin on Wednesday bringing
the worst flooding in 50 years.

Cyprus accuses Turkey of military buildup in occupied north
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Cyprus accused Turkey Monday of
bolstering its forces in the occupied north of the island with more
tanks and artillery.
	   It said Turkey was moving its forces ``in attack formations.''
	   ``In the past week alone, 50 more tanks and self-propelled
artillery pieces arrived in the Turkish-occupied north where
Turkish forces are being deployed in attack formations,'' said
Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou.
	   He charged that the new tanks were made in the United States. He
did not elaborate.
	   ``This constitutes a violation of American law which forbids the
use of U.S.-made weapons in such cases,'' Omirou said.
	   The Cyprus government says Turkey maintains more than 50,000
troops and 500 tanks in northern Cyprus.
	   Omirou's comments came a day before Thomas Miller, the U.S.
State Department special moderator for Cyprus, was due in Ankara to
try to defuse a looming crisis over the planned deployment by
Cyprus of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Miller is scheduled to hold talks Tuesday with Turkish Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem and Sukuru Siuna Gurel, minister of state in
charge of Turkey's relations with northern Cyprus, the U.S. Embassy
in Ankara said.
	   Turkey has warned that it will take action to prevent the
arrival of the Russian missiles in Cyprus. Greece, which has a
joint defense agreement with Cyprus, said it will defend Cyprus if
attacked.
	   This has raised the specter of hostilities between Greece and
Turkey, both members of the NATO alliance.
	   The United States and other Western governments have been
pressing Cyprus to cancel the deployment of the Russian missiles,
planned for next November. But President Glafcos Clerides said he
will only do so if Turkey accepts his proposal for the
demilitarization of the island or if there is progress in the
deadlocked U.N._sponsored talks for the reunification of the
island.
	   ``Cyprus has every right to strengthen its defenses in view of
the Turkish threats. It would be better if those pressing for the
cancellation of the deployment of the missiles pressured Turkey
instead to agree to our demilitarization proposal,'' said Omirou.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in 1974 in the wake of an abortive
coup by supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway Turkish
Cypriot state established in the north is only recognized by
Turkey.

<TEXT>
	   GEORGE, South Africa (AP) _ Smiling and joking with supporters,
apartheid-era president P. W. Botha on Monday listened for the last
time to lawyers argue his defense on charges of snubbing a body
probing apartheid atrocities.
	   In closing argument, Botha's lawyer told Magistrate Victor
Lugaju that technical flaws in legal papers served on the former
hard-line president were a cause for dismissing the case.
	   Attorney Lappe Laubscher said the summons had instructed Botha
to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as a
whole, whereas the hearing he was ordered to attend was being held
only by a sub-division of the panel.
	   ``He was subpoeanaed to appear before the TRC, not the Human
Rights Violation Committee. End of story,'' Laubscher said.
	   Adjourning the case after the lawyers had finished their
arguments, Lugaju, who is black, said he would deliver a verdict on
Friday.
	   If found guilty Botha, 82, could face up to two years in jail or
an unspecified fine. Given his age and frail health, a fine is
considered more likely.
	   Botha's spokesman, Paul Lombard, said Botha was looking forward
to the end of a tiring case. ``It doesn't matter who you are, or
how old you are. Something like this will take it out of you,'' he
said.
	   However, Botha appeared in a jovial mood on Monday. Wearing a
dark blue suit, he chatted to supporters and relatives in court,
including his daughter Elanza Maritz and new wife Barbara.
	   Dubbed the ``Big Crocodile'' for his stubborn political style,
Botha ruled South Africa with an iron fist for 11 years before a
stroke in 1989 saw him edged from power in a palace coup.
	   Commission lawyers wanted to quiz Botha on the role of the State
Security Council, a shadowy inner cabinet he headed which organized
a violent crackdown on anti-apartheid groups in the 1980s.
	   Botha alleges the commission wanted to humiliate him by forcing
him to appear in person after he submitted more than 1,700 pages of
written testimony.
	   The case has highlighted racial fault lines still dividing South
Africa four years after all-race elections ended apartheid.
	   Conservative whites sympathize with Botha's claim that the Truth
Commission is conducting a witch hunt against the old regime, while
blacks relish the spectacle of a black man sitting in judgement of
a hard-line apartheid leader.
	   For the commission, forcing Botha to appear became a key test of
its credibility in the face of criticisms from some blacks who saw
it as too soft on top apartheid politicians.
	   Supporters of the governing African National Congress say that
his continued defiance has damaged the commisson's quest for truth.
	   ``The impression you get is that through his defiance he is
hiding something, protecting some people or covering up,'' said ANC
Southern Cape organizer Lanvar Reid.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Mainland China will give Hong Kong two giant
pandas early next year as a gift, the Hong Kong government
announced Monday.
	   The pandas, known as Jia Jia and An An, will be housed in a
special enclosure to be built at Hong Kong's Ocean Park, a
government statement said.
	   It said the gift was a valuable opportunity for Hong Kong people
to learn about the endangered animal. Only about 1,000 pandas are
believed to remain in China.
	   Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule last year.

EU's Bosnia de-mining program back on track after technical, legal
</HEADLINE>
problems &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Monday it
has resolved technical and legal problems surrounding its funding
of a de-mining program in Bosnia and that removal of mines will
start shortly.
	   ``There were technical problems,'' said EU spokesman Costas
Verros EU to explain months of delay in removing unexploded
anti-personnel mines in Bosnia.
	   Also, he said the de-mining program fell victim to a recent EU
high court ruling forcing the European Commision to provide a legal
basis for a number of spending areas, including the mine removal
program.
	   ``New contracts have been signed and the program has been
restarted,'' said Verros.
	   In all some 700,000 mines are to be rendered harmless in a
de-mining program that was due to start last January. Already dlrs
6 million dollars have been spent to train and equip a 230-member
mine removal team.

Russia calls for peaceful settlement in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia reiterated its call for a peaceful
settlement of the conflict in Kosovo on Monday, after sending its
troops to a NATO-led exercise in the southern province in Serbia.
	   The military exercise that began Monday is ``an important factor
for streamlining the mechanism for dealing with humanitarian
problems and helping establish monitoring on the border in order to
shut down channels of arms trafficking and penetration of
terrorists into Kosovo,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery
Nesterushkin was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   At the same time, Nesterushkin stressed the need for ``maximum
caution in order to prevent hostilities that might threaten
dialogue,'' ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Russia supports broad autonomy for Kosovo, but not its secession
from Serb-led Yugoslavia, a longtime Slavic ally. Moscow has
adamantly opposed any NATO plans to use force to end the fighting
in Kosovo.
	   Russia has voiced concern over previous NATO air maneuvers in
June intended to put pressure on Serbia to stop its crackdown on
ethnic Albanians.
	   But it did sent troops to the new NATO exercises, which are to
run until Saturday and bring together more than 1,200 troops from
the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Greece, Spain, Britain,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Turkey, Italy, Albania, Russia, and
Lithuania.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev has also insisted that Russia's
participation in the maneuvers, being held in Albania and
Macedonia, does not mean a change in Moscow's policy, but he did
not elaborate.

Israeli defense minister sets off debate on Golan withdrawal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai touched off
a debate Monday over whether Israel might be now willing to return
much of the Golan Heights in a peace agreement with Syria in
exchange for security measures.
	   In an interview with the German magazine Focus published Monday,
Mordechai was asked his opinion of late Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin's formula for peace with Syria _ that the extent of Israel's
withdrawal from the Golan would depend on the extent of peace
offered by Syria.
	   Mordechai was quoted as saying in response that he had
``invented this formula.''
	   ``The greatest interest of the Syrians is territory _ our
greatest interest is security,'' he was quoted as saying. ``It's
simple: the more security we receive, the more land we can give
back.''
	   The statement drew a storm of protest from Cabinet ministers who
said Mordechai was violating the government's basic guidelines _
that the Golan is vital to Israel's security.
	   ``Peace with Syria, as we understand it, cannot be, because
Syria doesn't recognize the existence of Israel,'' said Agriculture
Minister Rafael Eitan, a retired general who fought in the Golan in
the 1973 Mideast War.
	   Netanyahu said Monday that the government's policy had not
changed, and Mordechai said he had been misquoted. But in an
interview on Israel Radio, Netanyahu's policy adviser Uzi Arad
linked the idea of a withdrawal with Israel's security demands in
the Golan.
	   Arad said such an equation was ``only logical,'' and said that
he had raised the possibility during a recent conference in Texas
attended by Syrian representatives.
	   Arad gave no specifics, however, about Israel's security
demands, and gave no indication that the current government would
be willing to meet Syria's demands for a withdrawal from all of the
Golan, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War.
	   Israel has in the past demanded security provisions that would
allow it to monitor Syria's compliance from the Golan Heights.
	   Israel's Maariv newspaper quoted unnamed political sources as
saying that Netanyahu supported Mordechai's statement, and that
several of the prime minister's advisers had used similar phrasing
recently.

Golf tournament to conclude six months after start
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PEBBLE BEACH, California (AP) _ When the tournament began in
February, waves from the Pacific Ocean were crashing onto the 18th
fairway. Torrential rain was turning sandtraps into water hazards
and gusty winds were snapping treetops.
	   The AT and T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am resumed Monday on a
dry morning on the Pebble Beach, Poppy Hills and Spyglass Hill
courses.
	   But the change in weather did not occur overnight. It took more
than six months.
	   The tournament, suspended in early February by El Nino-inspired
miserable weather, resumed with Americans Tom Watson and Tim Herron
tied for the lead.
	   Of the 168 pros who started the tournament, 135 were expected to
return to Pebble Beach for the final round.
	   Among those not returning were Tiger Woods, who finished the
second round 14 strokes off the lead, and fellow American Jack
Nicklaus. Also dropping out was Vijay Singh of Fiji, who won the
PGA Championship Sunday near Seattle.
	   The AT and T tournament chartered a plane to take players from
Seattle to Monterey Sunday night. Those continuing to the next tour
stop, the International in Denver, will get another chartered
flight Monday night.
	   Watson, at 10-under 134, won the Pebble Beach tournament in 1977
and 1978. If he wins this year, the two-decade separation between
victories would be a tourney record.
	   ``I have a chance to win a golf tournament, albeit a little
late,'' Watson said of the delayed finish.
	   PGA Tour officials said it's the first time a portion of a
tournament has been played, then completed months later.
	   The tournament was washed out after two rounds in 1996, making
it the first PGA Tour event that could not be completed since 1949.
	   There have been other tournaments delayed for months by the
weather. In 1991, the Independent Insurance Agent Open in Texas was
wiped out in early April and rescheduled for late October.
	   But this year's Pebble Beach tournament is different in that it
was halfway completed when it had to be halted for six months.
	   Players managed to squeeze in two soggy rounds in late January,
and organizers reduced the event to 54 holes. But heavy rains wiped
out play 1 1/2 hours after tee-off Feb. 1, and again Feb. 2 when
officials tried to extend it to Monday.
	   The third round was reset for March 2, then rescheduled for
Monday _ the day after the PGA Championship ended at the Sahalee
Country Club.
	   When play was interrupted six months ago, water had collected on
the greens and shots were disappearing into the muck. Because of
the bad weather, golfers were allowed to pick up their ball, clean
it and place it within a club's length of where it landed.
	   The lift, clean and place rule was in force again Monday to
prevent problems with tire marks on the fairways from a vintage car
show that wrapped up Sunday night.

Prosecutor investigating doping interrogates former Juventus star
</HEADLINE>
Gianluca Vialli &QL; 
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with quotes from national team doctor &QL; 
 &UR; With AP photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Former Juventus star Gianluca Vialli on
Monday met with a prosecutor looking into allegations that he and
other players in Italy's top division soccer league took
performance-enhancing substances.
	   Vialli, now player-coach of English club Chelsea, was summoned
after AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman told Italian media he was amazed
by the quick muscular development of players including Vialli and
Alessandro Del Piero, a star-forward for Juventus.
	   Vialli, who left Juventus in 1996, walked past reporters without
commenting following a 2 1/2-hour session with Turin prosecutor
Raffaele Guariniello. He has hotly denied taking illegal
substances, calling the prosecutor a ``terrorist trying to
destabilize the soccer world.''
	   During questioning Friday, Del Piero told Guariniello his
strength was the result of ``years of hard work.''
	   The prosecutor, who has been investigating doping in sports for
years, met with Zemen last week. The Czech coach stuck to his
allegations, but did not say which banned drugs the players
allegedly use.
	   Vialli, Del Piero and Juventus have all announced that they are
suing Zeman for libel.
	   In Bologna Monday, prosecutor Giovanni Spinosa interrogated
Italy's national soccer team doctor Paolo Zeppilli.
	   ``We absolutely did not speak about doping,'' Zeppilli said
following the hour-long session.
	   Spinosa is investigating whether the banned drug EPO, or
Erythropoietin, is used in soccer. Several cyclists in the Tour de
France allegedly took the drug to boost their performance.
	   Zepilli said he mainly answered questions on the relationship
between Italy's Soccer Federation and a Bologna pharmacy which
allegedly supplied the national team during the 1996 European
Championships in England.
	   ``We ordered some medicine from this pharmacy _ iron and
vitamins _ like many other teams, federations and athletes,''
Zepilli said.
	   Zepillo said he expected to discuss doping Tuesday during a
meeting with a panel of Italian Olympic Committee experts.
	   World Cup stars Dino Baggio and Enrico Chiesa of Parma were
interrogated by the Bologna prosecutor last week.

Major Albanian stronghold falls to Serb police
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with diplomats pushing to return to
negotiating, INCORPORATES NATO exercises in Albania. Trims outdated
information. &QL;

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After Serb forces drove rebel
Albanians from their last major strongholds in western Kosovo,
diplomatic efforts turned towards organizing talks on Kosovo's
future Monday.
	   According to the pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center,
fighting subsided Monday in the restive province of Kosovo,
following a weekend push when Serb forces captured a series of key
Albanian strongholds.
	   Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency said Monday Serb
police had ``crushed'' bases of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army in
the villages of Lodja, Grabovac and Rausic, all on the outskirts of
the province's second city of Pec on Sunday.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting Serb security
forces for independence of Serbia's Kosovo province, where
Albanians account for 90 percent of the population of 2 million.
	   Monday's lull in the fighitng revivied hopes that negotiations
stalled since May might be revived. Fehmi Agani, the top ethnic
Albanian negotiator, wrote to his Serbian counterpart Ratko
Markovic, saying the Albanians wanted the talks to resume, on the
condition that Serbs halt their offensive.
	   ``We expect violence will stop and units used against the
civilian population will be withdrawn,'' Agani said.
	   Agani did not mention a date, but said he hoped U.S. envoy
Christopher Hill would establish a time when talks could resume.
Hill traveled to Belgrade Monday, to meet with Serb leaders and
negotiators.
	   Over the past two weeks, government forces have succeeded in
driving the KLA from several key villages in western Kosovo.
Government gains have, however, proven difficult to maintain, as
the KLA simply return to an area the moment police move on.
	   The attacks on villages have left tens of thousands of refugees
camped in the woods in western Kosovo. The U.N. refugee agency
based in Geneva, said in a statement Monday it rushed a convoy to
Pec, where refugees who fled earlier fighting reportedly came under
attack and were forced south into the mountains.
	   Kris Janowski, spokesman for the agency also said the second in
command is to meet with leaders on both sides later in the week and
call for a cessation of hostilities and full access for
humanitarian operations.
	   The U.N. now estimates that more than 231,000 people have been
uprooted in the six months since the conflict began. Many of them
have fled across the mountainous border with Albanian, where the
KLA also maintains bases.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, Monday troops from 14 nations
gathered to conduct training for parachute supply drops, vehicle
and foot patrols, marksmanship and other non-offensive drills in
the Albanian mountains.
	   Although the Albanian government says it supports a peaceful
solution to the crisis in Kosovo, Americans and Europeans fear the
fighting could spill over into neighboring countries with large
Albanian communities.

Cyprus accuses Turkey of military buildup in occupied north
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Cyprus-Missing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) - Cyprus accused Turkey Monday of
bolstering its forces in the occupied north of the island with more
tanks and artillery, and moving troops ``in attack formations.''
	   Defense Minister Yiannakis Omirou's comments came a day before
Thomas Miller, the U.S. State Department special moderator for
Cyprus, was due in Ankara to try to defuse a looming crisis over
the planned deployment by Cyprus of Russian S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles.
	   ``In the past week alone, 50 more tanks and self-propelled
artillery pieces arrived in the Turkish-occupied north where
Turkish forces are being deployed in attack formations,'' said
Omirou.
	   He charged that the new tanks were made in the United States.
	   ``This constitutes a violation of American law which forbids the
use of U.S.-made weapons in such cases,'' Omirou said.
	   The Cyprus government says Turkey maintains more than 50,000
troops and 500 tanks in northern Cyprus.
	   Turkey has warned that it will take action to prevent the
arrival of the Russian missiles in Cyprus. Greece, which has a
joint defense agreement with Cyprus, said it will defend Cyprus if
attacked.
	   This has raised the specter of hostilities between Greece and
Turkey, both members of the NATO alliance.
	   Miller is scheduled to hold talks Tuesday with Turkish Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem and Sukru Sina Gurel, minister of state in
charge of Turkey's relations with northern Cyprus, the U.S. Embassy
in Ankara said.
	   The United States and other Western governments have been
pressing Cyprus to cancel the deployment of the Russian missiles,
planned for next November.
	   President Glafcos Clerides said he will only do so if Turkey
accepts his proposal for the demilitarization of the island or if
there is progress in the deadlocked U.N._sponsored talks for the
reunification of the island.
	   ``Cyprus has every right to strengthen its defenses in view of
the Turkish threats. It would be better if those pressing for the
cancellation of the deployment of the missiles pressured Turkey
instead to agree to our demilitarization proposal,'' said Omirou.
	   Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot controlled south
and a Turkish-occupied north since Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in 1974 in the wake of an abortive
coup by supporters of union with Greece. A breakaway Turkish
Cypriot state established in the north is only recognized by
Turkey.

Boris Yeltsin gives up his primary success to prevent bigger

failures &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Economy, BC-Russia-Ruble Rage &QL; 
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL; 
 &UR; By MAURA REYNOLDS
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Until it went crashing on Monday, the ruble had
perhaps been Boris Yeltsin's only economic boast.
	   Russians have endured wave after wave of financial pain since
Yeltsin dismantled the Soviet Union in 1991, suffering through
several cycles of hyperinflation that gutted their savings and
robbed their pride.
	   Since then his one inarguable success was that he managed to
stabilize the currency, giving Russians a measure of confidence
that what they earned today would buy something tomorrow.
	   That confidence was shattered on Monday, when the government set
in motion a sharp devaluation of the ruble. And the reverberations
are likely to last for months and maybe even until presidential
elections in 2000.
	   First, consumer prices will climb _ some quickly, some over
time. The pain will be widespread, since a large number of consumer
goods are imported, including half the groceries sold in Russian
stores.
	   In addition, many banks _ some estimates say half the country's
1,500 banks _ have weak hard currency reserves and will collapse.
	   However, several factors suggest that those developments will be
less of a blow than one might expect. Most Russians grow at least
some of their own food, and very few keep their money in banks.
Those who do tend to hold the deposits in dollars, not rubles.
	   Moreover, many of the banks expected to collapse are not real
banks in the Western sense _ they don't hold deposits and they
don't make commercial loans. Instead, they are effectively money
speculation companies, buying and selling stocks and bonds without
providing banking services. Their collapse will have little effect
on the rest of the economy.
	   Perhaps the highest costs will be political.
	   Opposition leaders say that after years of hardship, the
population is primed to explode in anger. Coal miners across the
country have been striking sporadically throughout the summer.
	   However, Alan Rousso, director of the Carnegie Endowment's
Moscow office, points out that historically, Russian unrest tends
to be localized, not national in scope. And the government's
decision to halt payment on foreign debt means that for the first
time in years, it is expected to be able to pay all the back wages
owed to state workers _ including the miners.
	   Russians have endured so much economic hardship that they have
developed strong survival skills. It remains to be seen whether the
latest blows are strong enough to upset their traditional
fortitude.
	   That was a gamble Yeltsin didn't want to take. He held out
against devaluation for most of the summer, hoping a rise in oil
prices or a return of investor confidence would replenish the
government's wallet.
	   When they didn't, his hand was forced. It is a measure of the
seriousness of the financial crisis that Yeltsin spent his most
valuable political capital to try to get out of it.
	   In the end, Yeltsin's political standing is probably secure. He
is more than halfway through his second term, there are no
potential challengers in a position to force him from power, and he
is likely to deflect the blame to his subordinates, as he has in
the past.
	   But without a stable ruble, Russia's economy leaves him little
to boast about.

Cantona to captain Manchester United for the last time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Retired French soccer star Eric
Cantona will captain Manchester United one last time _ in a
testimonial match against a team named in his honor.
	   Cantona will lead his old club into the Munich Air Disaster
testimonal match at Old Trafford on Tuesday.
	   The match was arranged to mark the 40th anniversary of the air
tragedy, which claimed the lives of eight Manchester United players
in February 1958.
	   Cantona, who helped the Red Devils to four Premier League titles
in five years at the club, arrived in Manchester on Monday for the
first time since his sudden retirement 17 months ago.
	   His last game at Old Trafford was in the final game of the 1997
championship-winning campaign. He is expected to bid farewell to a
sell-out 55,000 crowd at Old Trafford.
	   The match was originally scheduled for February to coincide with
the date of the air crash but had to be postponed due to Manchester
United's FA Cup commitments.
	   Bryan Robson will lead the Cantona 11, which will also include
French striker Jean-Pierre Papin, Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, David
Batty and Gary McAllister.
	   French World Cup captain Laurent Blanc, who missed France's
historic World Cup win after being sent off in the semifinal
against Croatia, will also play for the Cantona 11.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rubin statement. &QL; 
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. government and the International
Monetary Fund urged Russian authorities Monday to act without delay
on economic reform measures that will be needed to bolstern
investors' confidence following the decision to devalue the ruble.
	   ``We believe it is critically important that the Russian
authorities move quickly to take actions to restore confidence,
including the adoption of a careful and cooperative approach to
dealing with its creditors and the full implementation of the
measures outlined in the Russian stabilization program agreed with
the IMF,'' U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said in a
statement.
	   Stressing that ``the United States and the international
community have a great stake in successful Russian economic
reform,'' Rubin said it would be critical going forward for the IMF
to work with Russian officials to find appropriate ways to support
Russia's economic recovery.
	   Rubin made no mention in the statement of whether the United
States would be prepared to support further Western aid to Russia.
	   In a separate statement, Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing
director, said the IMF will immediately analyze steps taken by the
Russian government to stabilize plunging financial markets. These
include a devaluation of the ruble, announced earlier Monday, that
is expected to reach 50 percent.

Six Croats in dock for start of U.N. court's largest mass trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Six Bosnian Croats accused of
taking part in a notorious 1993 massacre of more than 100 Muslims
went on trial Monday in the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal's largest
mass prosecution.
	   The defendants allegedly were among Bosnian Croat troops who
swarmed through the central Bosnian village of Ahmici on April 16,
1993, killing at least 103 Muslims including some 33 women and
children. Entire families were gunned down and their houses
torched.
	   One victim, shot and left to die in a burning house, was just
three months old, according to the tribunal indictment.
	   British soldiers who visited Ahmici on the day of the massacre
``saw some 20 bodies,'' tribunal prosecutor Frank Terrier said in
his opening statement.
	   ``Bodies of civilian people. Some were female bodies, some were
bodies of children. One woman was killed while she was still
holding the hand of her child,'' he said.
	   Locals claimed the operation, aimed at driving Muslims out of
the region, was codenamed ``48 Hours of Ashes,'' Terrier told
judges. He also played video footage of a British Broadcasting
Corp. news program in which British soldiers were shown recovering
charred bodies from the wreckage of houses in Ahmici.
	   The defendants _ brothers Zoran and Mirjan Kupreskic; their
cousin, Vlatko Kupreskic; and Vladimir Santic, Drago Josipovic and
Dragan Papic _ all sat calmly in court Monday, flanked by seven
United Nations guards.
	   In preliminary statements Monday, attorney Ranko Radovic,
defending Zoran Kupreskic, described the men as ``peasants ...
defending their homes.''
	   Vlatko Kupreskic was arrested Dec. 18 by Dutch and U.S. NATO
troops in the town of Vitez near Ahmici. The remaining five
defendants surrendered to the tribunal a year ago after pressure
from Croatian authorities who had been pushed by the United States
to get the suspects to the court.
	   All six are jointly accused of a crime against humanity for
persecuting the inhabitants of Ahmici. The defendants face an
additional 18 charges relating to specific allegations of murder
and inhumane treatment of the village's Muslim inhabitants.
	   They have all pleaded innocent to the charges, which carry a
maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
	   The trial is the sixth currently running at the U.N. court,
which was set up in 1993 to prosecute those responsible for
atrocities in the wars in the former Yugoslavia.
	   Although the case, expected to last months and hear evidence
from dozens of witnesses, is one of the tribunal's biggest, the
defendants were allegedly no more than rank-and-file soldiers in
the Croatian Defense Council militia.
	   The force's regional commander, Gen. Tihomir Blaskic, is also on
trial at the tribunal charged with planning and organizing a
systematic campaign of terror aimed at driving Muslims out of the
entire region surrounding and including Ahmici.
	   Just two war criminals have so far been convicted and sentenced
by the 11-judge court. Its two most-wanted suspects, former Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief, Gen.
Ratko Mladic, remain at large.

Suspect in embassy bombings: Hot lead or false trail?

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Is he a hot lead to the exiled Saudi
fanatic who might be behind the U.S. Embassy bombings in East
Africa? Or is he a false trail?
	   After three days of questioning, a suspect flown in from
Pakistan has not admitted any role in the crimes or implicated
anyone else, the FBI said Monday.
	   But reports out of Pakistan, have said he had confessed and
named his co-conspirators.
	   The reports also said the man had ties to a renegade Saudi
multimillionaire Osama bin Laden, whom the United States says is
one of the world's major sponsors of terrorism.
	   In a joint statement, the FBI and Kenyan police identified the
suspect as Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, also known as Abdull Bast Awadh
and Mohammad Sadiq Howaida.
	   He was arrested in Karachi after arriving on a flight from
Nairobi on Aug. 7, the day blasts in the Kenyan capital and in Dar
es Salaam, Tanzania, killed 257 people and injured more than 5,500.
	   The FBI and Kenyan police said they were questioning Odeh, but
revealed no breakthroughs.
	   ``Mr. Saddiq Odeh has not admitted any responsibility in the
bombings in Nairobi or Dar es Salaam, nor has he implicated anyone
else in those events,'' they said in a terse joint statement.
	   The Pakistani Foreign Ministry has said Odeh was returned to
Nairobi because Pakistani officials believe he is linked to the
bombings.
	   The Nairobi blast, which caused most of the deaths and injuries,
was the worst-ever attack on a U.S. embassy.
	   Coils of barbed wire, mounds of sandbags, tense soldiers and
sniffer dogs confront visitors at the temporary new U.S. embassy in
Nairobi.
	   In Pakistan, most U.S. Embassy personnel were leaving Monday and
other Americans were urged to join them after Odeh's transfer to
Nairobi.
	   The State Department issued a ``worldwide caution'' to U.S.
travelers over the weekend because of fresh threats to U.S.
interests abroad.
	   Bin Laden, the exiled heir to a Saudi construction fortune, is
said to be a fanatic Muslim on a crusade to drive U.S. troops from
the Middle East.
	   He is suspected of being behind several terrorist attacks on
American targets, including a 1995 truck bombing in Saudi Arabia
that killed five U.S. servicemen.
	   The FBI and Kenyan police refused to comment further on reports
that Odeh had confessed to Pakistani authorities, saying the
attacks were sponsored by bin Laden.
	   The Pakistani national newspaper, The News, said Odeh is a
34-year-old Palestinian engineer. Other reports said he is married
to a Kenyan and familiar with Nairobi.
	   He reportedly told investigators that six co-conspirators had
slipped through the Karachi airport Aug. 7 and made it to
Afghanistan, where bin Laden has a hideout.
	   A spokesman for Afghanistan's Taliban militia told The
Associated Press Monday that bin Laden had pledged not to engage in
terrorism while living under Taliban protection and had nothing to
do with the embassy bombings.
	   A Kenyan newspaper, meanwhile, reported Monday that FBI agents
had flown a second suspect back to Nairobi, also on Friday. It said
the suspect was arrested in the United Arab Emirates.
	   Spokesmen for the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi and Kenyan police both
declined comment. A Pakistani Embassy spokesman said he was unaware
of the arrest.
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was to visit Nairobi and
Dar es Salaam on Tuesday in a show of support for the victims and
of resolve in the face of growing terrorist threats to Americans.
	   Departing Washington on Monday, Albright said she was bringing a
``message of solidarity'' to embassy personnel in Nairobi and Dar
es Salaam.
	   ``To the people of Kenya and Tanzania,'' she added, ``I will
bring a message of friendship, made deeper by our shared grief, and
of support in doing all we can to ease their suffering and help
them start anew.''

Israeli jets attack guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon Monday, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 6.20 p.m.
(15:20 GMT) air raid, the second in south Lebanon in four days.
	   Two fighter jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on hills of
Sojod and Mazraat Iqmata in the Iqlim al-Tuffah province, a
Hezbollah stronghold that faces an Israeli-occupied border enclave
in south Lebanon, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Last Thursday, Israeli warplanes fired two missiles on Mazraat
Iqmata, an area in a no-man's land about 500 meters (yards) from an
Israeli military outpost in Sojod inside the occupied zone. There
were no casualties in that raid.
	   Monday's raid came a day after Israeli-allied militiamen killed
a leftist Lebanese guerrilla and captured another as the pair
infiltrated the occupied zone.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah is a frequent target of Israeli warplanes.
	   The area is used by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group
as a base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied
Lebanese militiamen in the occupied zone.
	   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to oust about 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and 2,500 members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia from the occupied zone.

German TV journalist is accused of insider trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A German television journalist is
under investigation for allegedly telling his friends which stocks
he was going to recommend buying on his weekly program, a German
newsmagazine reported Monday.
	   Frankfurt prosecutors confirmed charges of insider trading were
being considered against 33-year-old Egbert Prior, who has been
heralded by investors as ``Germany's first international stock
market guru.''
	   Prior allegedly tipped off friends before his program's Friday
time slot, enabling them to purchase the stocks he recommended late
in the week and then profit by selling them the following Monday,
after his viewers followed the same advice.
	   Prior, a former newspaper editor who also puts out a financial
information service bearing his name, was unavailable for comment
Monday.
	   Job Tilmann, spokesman for the Frankfurt prosecutor's office,
confirmed they had joined an investigation begun by federal stock
market regulators months ago. The federal office refused to
comment.

Israeli bank robbing legend to get early prison release
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli businessman turned bank robber whose
motorcycle getaways were legendary in Israel during the late 1980s
will be released early for good behavior, the prison authority said
Monday.
	   Roni Liebowitz, nicknamed the ``Bikerbank,'' became a popular
cult figure after claiming that robbing banks was the only way to
maintain a decent lifestyle in Israel. Liebowitz, whose trademark
was firing one shot in the air before taking off on his bike, stole
over 300,000 shekels (then about dlrs 175,500) in 22 heists.
	   In 1990, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison but a parole
committee this week found Liebowitz to be a model prisoner and
recommended an early release, prison authority spokeswoman Orit
Messer-Harel said. She said Lebovitz would be paroled Sept. 2,
after having served half his sentence.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ An Albanian truck carrying medicinal
herbs also was laden with almost a half-ton of marijuana, the
Austria Press Agency reported Monday.
	   After receiving a tip from Slovenian officials, customs officers
in Austria stopped the truck as it entered the country last Tuesday
at the Karawanken Tunnel, about 335 kilometers (210 miles)
southwest of the capital, Vienna, APA reported.
	   Customs officers, aided by a drug-sniffing dog, discovered the
drug stashed behind a false wall in the truck.
	   The Belgian truck driver was turned over to police. No other
details were available.

Israeli bank robbing legend to get early prison release
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Ai businessman turned bank robber whose
motorcycle getaways were legendary in Israel during the late 1980s
will be released early for good behavior, the prison authority said
Monday.
	   Roni Liebowitz, nicknamed the ``Bikerbank,'' became a popular
cult figure after claiming that robbing banks was the only way to
maintain a decent lifestyle in Israel.
	   Liebowitz, whose trademark was firing one shot in the air before
taking off on his bike, stole over 300,000 shekels (then about dlrs
175,500) in 22 heists.
	   In 1991, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison but a parole
committee this week found Liebowitz to be a model prisoner and
recommended an early release, prison authority spokeswoman Orit
Messer-Harel said.
	   She said Lebovitz would be paroled Sept. 2, after having served
half his sentence.

Yeltsin urges evacuation of Russians from Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin on Monday urged an
evacuation of Russian citizens from Congo, where rebel fighters
have been closing in on the capital Kinshasa.
	   Yeltsin urged all Russian citizens, including those who are
permanent residents of Congo, to leave the country, and ordered
evacuation assistance to citizens of other former Soviet republics,
the Interfax news agency reported, citing the presidential press
service.
	   Yeltsin also ordered an evacuation of Russian embassy staff and
their families, the report said.
	   Hundreds of foreigners fled Congo over the weekend, amid fears
that President Laurent Kabila's government will not survive the
advance of a rebel coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters, Rwandan
soldiers and disenchanted members of Kabila's military.
	   Many of the rebels had helped Kabila oust longtime dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997, but now say they have been
marginalized by the government and accuse Kabila of corruption and
nepotism.

German Jewish leader says Holocaust memorial could still be built
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The head of Germany's Jewish community said Monday
that a national Holocaust Memorial could still be built in Berlin
even if the city government votes against the plans, as the mayor
wants.
	   Ignatz Bubis, chairman of the Central Council of Jews in
Germany, noted that private backers initiated the project and the
federal government has already donated a large plot in the heart of
the city.
	   Berlin's city government is to discuss the much-delayed project
on Aug. 25, and could vote on a design the same day, or put it off
again. Spokesman Eduard Heussen said there was no clear majority
either way.
	   Some support a reworked design by U.S. architect Peter Eisenman,
which Chancellor Helmut Kohl is also known to favor. But others _
like Mayor Eberhard Diepgen _ don't like any of the three
finalists.
	   Diepgen said in a newspaper interview Sunday that he found the
proposals too ``monumental'' and thought the chosen site was wrong
as well. He has said he does not want Berlin to become a ``city of
mourning,'' with one memorial after another.
	   Diepgen has only one vote and can not alone block the plan,
however.
	   Kohl has promised to announce a winner in the design competition
before national elections on Sept. 27, but his spokesman in Bonn
said Monday the chancellor would wait to see what the Berlin city
government decides.
	   Kohl's challenger for chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder of the
Social Democrats said in a TV interview this month that he would
call for a new national debate on the memorial if he's elected.
	   Schroeder's pick to be culture czar, Michael Naumann, caused a
stir this summer by saying he thought a monument was too grandiose
and the money might be better spent maintaining former
concentration camps, which carry more direct emotional impact.

Russia calls for peaceful settlement in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that exercises in Albania. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia reiterated its call for a peaceful
settlement of the conflict in Kosovo on Monday, after sending its
troops to a NATO-led exercise near the southern province in Serbia.
	   The military exercise that began Monday in Albania is ``an
important factor for streamlining the mechanism for dealing with
humanitarian problems and helping establish monitoring on the
border in order to shut down channels of arms trafficking and
penetration of terrorists into Kosovo,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Valery Nesterushkin was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   At the same time, Nesterushkin stressed the need for ``maximum
caution in order to prevent hostilities that might threaten
dialogue,'' ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Russia supports broad autonomy for Kosovo, but not its secession
from Serb-led Yugoslavia, a longtime Slavic ally. Moscow has
adamantly opposed any NATO plans to use force to end the fighting
in Kosovo.
	   Russia has voiced concern over previous NATO air maneuvers in
June intended to put pressure on Serbia to stop its crackdown on
ethnic Albanians.
	   But it did send troops to the new NATO exercises, which are to
run until Saturday and bring together more than 1,200 troops from
the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Greece, Spain, Britain,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Turkey, Italy, Albania, Russia, and
Lithuania.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev has also insisted that Russia's
participation in the maneuvers, being held in Albania and
Macedonia, does not mean a change in Moscow's policy, but he did
not elaborate.

Israeli defense minister sets off debate on Golan withdrawal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The return of land on the Golan Heights depends
on the security measures Syria offers Israel in exchange, Israel's
defense minister says, touching off a debate within his government
on Monday over whether the strategic plateau was even negotiatable.
	   In an interview with the German magazine Focus published Monday,
Yitzhak Mordechai went beyond Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
deliberately vague pronouncements on what the Syrians would receive
for peace.
	   ``The greatest interest of the Syrians is territory _ our
greatest interest is security,'' Focus quoted him as saying. ``It's
simple: the more security we receive, the more land we can give
back.''
	   Mordechai said he was in agreement with the late Yitzhak Rabin's
thinking on the issue.
	   Netanyahu had assailed Rabin's Golan policies in opposition, and
Mordechai's statements drew a storm of protest from Cabinet
ministers who said he was violating one of the government's basic
guidelines _ that the Golan is vital to Israel's security.
	   ``Peace with Syria, as we understand it, cannot be, because
Syria doesn't recognize the existence of Israel,'' said Agriculture
Minister Rafael Eitan, a retired general who fought in the Golan in
the 1973 Mideast War.
	   Netanyahu said Monday that the government's policy had not
changed, and Mordechai said he had been misquoted.
	   But in an interview on Israel Radio, Netanyahu's policy adviser
Uzi Arad linked the idea of a withdrawal with Israel's security
demands in the Golan.
	   Arad said such an equation was ``only logical,'' and said that
he had raised the possibility during a recent conference in Texas
attended by Syrian representatives.
	   Arad gave no specifics, however, about Israel's security
demands, and gave no indication that the current government would
be willing to meet Syria's demands for a withdrawal from all of the
Golan, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War.
	   Rabin demanded security provisions that would allow it to
monitor Syria's compliance from the Golan Heights.
	   Israel's Maariv newspaper quoted unnamed political sources as
saying that Netanyahu supported Mordechai's statement, and that
several of the prime minister's advisers had used similar phrasing
recently.

Amid unrelenting financial turmoil, Russia lets ruble drop

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After spending billions of dollars over the past
three months to prop up Russia's weak currency, the government gave
up on Monday and let the ruble's value drop by up to 34 percent.
	   Russians have already been hit hard by the country's fiscal
troubles, which have robbed many of their salaries for months. The
drop in the currency is an even harsher blow for rank-and-file
consumers, as it will increase the prices of imports that which
account for a large percentage of Russian consumer goods, including
groceries.
	   Russia's 1,500 banks, will also suffer, and up to half are
expected to go belly-up in the next few weeks.
	   The government-sanctioned drop in the currency is likewise
expected to shake foreign investors, whose confidence in the
government's ability to overcome the crisis has already been
shrinking steadily. Prices on European markets dropped on the news
that the government would let the ruble's lower limit sink 33.7
percent, from 6.3 to 9.5 to the dollar _ or from about 15.873 cents
to 10.526 cents.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko insisted that the ruble's new
lower limit ``does not mean a devaluation of the ruble'' _ the step
that government officials have sworn repeatedly they would not
allow.

 &UR; Kohl expresses concern over ruble devaluation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl expressed concern
Monday over Russia's devaluation of the ruble, but said that any
negative impact could be mitigated through careful economic
policies.
	   His finance minister, Theo Waigel, warned that Russia's plan to
control the free flow of capital must not jeopardize the trend to
liberalize capital markets.
	   ``Under no circumstances must the fundamental liberalization of
capital movement be questioned,'' Waigel said in a news release.
``Russia would hurt itself the most.''
	   The decision to devaluate the troubled ruble had an immediate
impact on the German stock exchange, bringing down share prices in
some of Germany's largest commercial banks.
	   Commerzbank shares closed down 3.2 percent, and Dresdner Bank
shares slipped 2.8 percent. Deutsche Bank shares bucked the trend,
rising 1.4 percent.
	   The Dax stock index closed up 0.2 percent from Friday, at
5456.58 points.
	   German banks exposure to the Russian market totaled dlrs 30.4
billion at the end of 1997, according to the Bank for International
Settlements. Most of banks' outstanding credits, however, are
guaranteed by the German government.
	   A Finance Ministry spokeswoman said Russia's 90-day moratorium
on the payment of foreign credits could affect 500 million marks
(dlrs 280 million) in credits guaranteed by the German government.
	   German government credit guarantees to Russia totaled 84 billion
marks (dlrs 47 billion) at the end of 1997, the Finance Ministry
said in a statement.
	   Stock exchanges across Europe also dipped on the devaluation.
	   _The French stock market recouped by the end of the day after
falling early on following the news of the devaluation of the
ruble. Still, the CAC 40 index was down 11.10 points, or 0.3
percent to close at 3983.81 points.
	   The French market exhibited nervousness in part because of
German bank exposure in Russia.
	   _At the Helsinki Stock Exchange, companies that deal in
foodstuffs dropped 4 percent, and analysts predicted that chemical,
textile, clothing and electronics industries also would suffer if
the devaluation continues.
	   _Share prices on Milan's stock market fell sharply at first news
of the devaluation but ended the day up 335 points, or 1 percent.
Traders said Italian banks and companies have only limited exposure
in Russia, and expected the devaluation to have no major impact
here.
	   _The Athens Stock Exchange's general share prices index closed
at 2,539.35 points, down 42.08 points, or 1.6 percent from Friday's
close.

	   BODRUM, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish authorities detained 331 would-be
immigrants as they prepared to board a ship for illegal passage to
Greece, paramilitary police said Monday.
	   The group, arrested Sunday night near the popular Aegean resort
of Bodrum, included 231 Turkish citizens, the semi-official
Anatolia news agency reported. The rest were 87 Iraqis, seven
Nigerians, four Moroccans and two Canadians, the news agency said.
	   Paramilitary police in Bodrum, 700 kilometers (440 miles)
southwest of Ankara, said the illegal immigrants were caught while
they were traveling on buses near the resort community, soon before
they were to get on the ship.
	   The nature of the involvement of the Canadians was not clear,
and the Canadian Embassy was unable to confirm their presence among
the detainees.
	   Illegal immigrants often try to go from Turkey into Greece, and
then on to northern Europe.
	   On the Turkish-Greek border, in Thrace, 41 would-be immigrants _
including Iraqi, Iranians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis _ were
detained near the Meric River that separates the two countries,
Anatolia reported.
	   The river is known as Evros in Greek.

Crimean Tatars adopting Ukrainian citizenship at slow pace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ More than 7,000 Crimean Tatars who returned
to their homeland adopted Ukrainian citizenship this year, but many
more still lack it, Ukraine's senior immigration official said
Monday.
	   Some 81,000 Tatars holding citizenship of a different country
cannot become Ukrainian citizens because the country's legislation
bans double citizenship, said Nadiya Poyarkova, chief of the
immigration department of the Interior Ministry.
	   About 15,000 Tatars have no citizenship at all, she added,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Poyarkova said that many Tatars lack the required identification
documents or are unwilling to undertake registration procedures.
Some don't have enough money to pay the required fees.
	   Hundreds of Tatars clashed with Ukrainian police earlier this

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces have driven rebel
Albanians from their last major strongholds in western Kosovo, and
diplomatic efforts turned Monday towards organizing talks on the
province's future.
	   According to the pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center,
fighting subsided Monday following a weekend push when Serb forces
captured a series of key Albanian strongholds.
	   Yugoslavia's state-run Tanjug news agency said Monday Serb
police had ``crushed'' bases of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army in
the villages of Lodja, Grabovac and Rausic, all on the outskirts of
the province's second city of Pec on Sunday.
	   The rebel Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting Serb security
forces for independence of Serbia's Kosovo province, where
Albanians account for 90 percent of the population of 2 million.
	   Monday's lull in the fighitng revivied hopes that negotiations
stalled since May might be revived. Fehmi Agani, the top ethnic
Albanian negotiator, wrote to his Serbian counterpart Ratko
Markovic, saying the Albanians wanted the talks to resume on the
condition that Serbs halt their offensive.
	   ``We expect violence will stop and units used against the
civilian population will be withdrawn,'' Agani said.
	   Agani did not mention a date, but said he hoped U.S. envoy
Christopher Hill would establish a time when talks could resume.
Hill traveled to Belgrade Monday, to meet with Serb leaders and
negotiators.
	   Over the past two weeks, government forces have succeeded in
driving the KLA from several key villages in western Kosovo.
Government gains have, however, proven difficult to maintain, as
the KLA simply returns to an area the moment police move on.
	   The attacks on villages have left tens of thousands of refugees
camped in the woods in western Kosovo.
	   The U.N. refugee agency based in Geneva said in a statement
Monday it rushed a convoy to Pec, where refugees who fled earlier
fighting reportedly came under attack and were forced south into
the mountains.
	   The U.N. now estimates that more than 231,000 people have been
uprooted in the six months since the conflict began. Many of them
have fled across the mountainous border with Albania, where the KLA
also maintains bases.
	   In the Albanian capital Tirana, troops from 14 nations gathered
Monday to conduct training for parachute supply drops, vehicle and
foot patrols, marksmanship and other non-offensive drills in the
Albanian mountains.
	   The United States and Europeans fear the fighting could spill
over into neighboring countries with large Albanian communities.

Turkish crime figure arrested in Nice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ A prominent Turkish organized crime figure
being sought for attempted murder was arrested Monday on the French
Riviera, police said.
	   Alaatin Cakici, described by police as dangerous, was arrested
in a Nice hotel along with a female companion and his bodyguard,
who was armed with a pistol, police said.
	   Acting on arrest warrants from Turkey via Interpol, about 20
officers were involved in the operation, police officials said on
customary anonymity. Turkish officials suspect Cakici of attempted
murder, they said.
	   He was being detained ahead of extradition proceedings, the
police said.

Greek authorities arrest Turks for raising Turkish flag
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KALYMNOS, Greece (AP) _ Greek authorities arrested six Turks who
allegedly raised their nation's flag on a lamppost Monday during a
local festival.
	   They were released on the nearby island of Kos after misdemeanor
charges were filed for disturbing the peace, disturbing national
sentiments and leaving port without sailing permission. A March
trial was scheduled.
	   National symbols evoke strong emotions on Aegean islands near
the Turkish coast, an area where Turks have questioned Greek
sovereignty over many islets.
	   The six Turks, including a heart surgeon and a Mercedes dealer,
arrived here aboard a Turkish yacht, allegedly raised the flag,
then fled on the boat, which was intercepted by a Greek coast guard
patrol boat.

Russia's border chief travels to Tajikistan to inspect border

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Russian Defense Ministry official warning of
Russia's possible military actions in grafs 5-6, CLARIFIES Russia
has option of stationing border troops in other CIS countries. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin ordered his border chief
to Tajikistan on Monday to ensure that the former Soviet Union's
southern borders are secure following recent Taliban victories in
Afghanistan.
	   Federal Border Service head Nikolai Bordyuzha will inspect posts
along Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan and meet local leaders
to discuss threats along the boundary, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   The former Soviet republics of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and
Turkmenistan, now part of the Commonwealth of Independent States,
fear a complete Taliban victory could send an influx of refugees
and weapons across their borders.
	   The presidents of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, as well as of
nearby Kazakstan and Kyrgyzstan, plan to organize a meeting between
their foreign and defense ministers to discuss ways of stepping up
security in the region, Interfax reported.
	   A senior Russian Defense Ministry official, Col. Gen. Valery
Manilov, warned Monday that ``the situation may develop along
military lines,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``We must be prepared to prevent and, if necessary, to counter
the radical developments of the situation in the region,'' Manilov
was quoted as saying.
	   As part of CIS agreements, Russia has the option of keeping
troops along the borders of many former Soviet republics.

Six Croats in dock for start of U.N. court's largest mass trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Six Bosnian Croats accused of
taking part in a notorious 1993 massacre of more than 100 Muslims
went on trial Monday in the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal's largest
mass prosecution.
	   The defendants allegedly were among Bosnian Croat troops who
swarmed through the central Bosnian village of Ahmici on April 16,
1993, killing at least 103 Muslims including some 33 women and
children. Entire families were gunned down and their houses
torched.
	   One victim, shot and left to die in a burning house, was just
three months old, according to the tribunal indictment.
	   British soldiers who visited Ahmici on the day of the massacre
``saw some 20 bodies,'' tribunal prosecutor Frank Terrier said in
his opening statement.
	   ``Bodies of civilian people. Some were female bodies, some were
bodies of children. One woman was killed while she was still
holding the hand of her child,'' he said.
	   Locals claimed the operation, aimed at driving Muslims out of
the region, was codenamed ``48 Hours of Ashes,'' Terrier told
judges. He also played video footage of a British Broadcasting
Corp. news program in which British soldiers were shown recovering
charred bodies from the wreckage of houses in Ahmici.
	   The defendants _ brothers Zoran and Mirjan Kupreskic; their
cousin, Vlatko Kupreskic; and Vladimir Santic, Drago Josipovic and
Dragan Papic _ all sat calmly in court Monday, flanked by seven
United Nations guards.
	   In preliminary statements Monday, attorney Ranko Radovic,
defending Zoran Kupreskic, described the men as ``peasants ...
defending their homes.''
	   Vlatko Kupreskic was arrested Dec. 18 by Dutch and U.S. NATO
troops in the town of Vitez near Ahmici. The remaining five
defendants surrendered to the tribunal a year ago after pressure
from Croatian authorities who had been pushed by the United States
to get the suspects to the court.
	   All six are jointly accused of a crime against humanity for
persecuting the inhabitants of Ahmici. The defendants face an
additional 18 charges relating to specific allegations of murder
and inhumane treatment of the village's Muslim inhabitants.
	   They have all pleaded innocent to the charges, which carry a
maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
	   The trial is the sixth currently running at the U.N. court,
which was set up in 1993 to prosecute those responsible for
atrocities in the wars in the former Yugoslavia.
	   Although the case, expected to last months and hear evidence
from dozens of witnesses, is one of the tribunal's biggest, the
defendants were allegedly no more than rank-and-file soldiers in
the Croatian Defense Council militia.
	   The force's regional commander, Gen. Tihomir Blaskic, is also on
trial at the tribunal charged with planning and organizing a
systematic campaign of terror aimed at driving Muslims out of the
region surrounding Ahmici.
	   Just two war criminals have so far been convicted and sentenced
by the 11-judge court. Its two most-wanted suspects, former Bosnian
Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his wartime military chief, Gen.
Ratko Mladic, remain at large.

No special hunting grounds for pols, Lithuanian president vows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ The former U.S. official who now is
president of Lithuania said Monday that he wants to get rid of the
country's practice of having exclusive hunting grounds for
high-ranking officials.
	   President Valdas Adamkus said he couldn't justify tax money
being spent on the grounds, which he said hearkened back to the
Middle Ages when Lithuania was a monarchy, the Baltic News Service
reported.
	   ``How can we officials have exclusive rights to such
festivities, as if we were dukes in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania,''
he said. ``Officials with a passion for hunting can pay for the
sport as all mortals do.''
	   Adamkus was born in Lithuania, but fled as a young man during
the turmoil of World War II, in which Lithuania was occupied both
by the Nazis and the Soviet Union. He emigrated to the United
States, eventually becoming a top official in the Environmental
Prrotection Agency.
	   He returned to Lithuania last year and campaigned for the
presidency on a platform of greater openness and accountability in
government.

Israeli jets attack guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon Monday, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 6.20 p.m.
(15:20 GMT) air raid, the second in south Lebanon in four days.
	   Two fighter jets fired two air-to-surface missiles on hills of
Sojod and Mazraat Iqmata in the Iqlim al-Tuffah province, a
Hezbollah stronghold that faces an Israeli-occupied border enclave
in south Lebanon, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Last Thursday, Israeli warplanes fired two missiles on Mazraat
Iqmata, an area in a no-man's land about 500 meters (yards) from an
Israeli military outpost in Sojod inside the occupied zone. There
were no casualties in that raid.
	   On Sunday, Israeli-allied militiamen killed a leftist Lebanese
guerrilla and captured another as the pair infiltrated the occupied
zone.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah is a frequent target of Israeli warplanes.
	   The area is used by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrilla group
as a base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied
Lebanese militiamen in the occupied zone.
	   Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war to oust about 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and 2,500 members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia from the occupied zone.

World's first triple transplant patient dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The world's first triple transplant patient has
died 12 years after the operation that gave her a new heart, lungs
and liver.
	   Davina Thompson died Thursday at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge
from lung disease, hospital spokeswoman Kate Lancaster said Monday.
She was 47.
	   Mrs. Thompson's operation in 1986, to fight a progressive
illness, was generally considered a success, and led the way for
other triple transplants, Lancaster said.
	   ``She enjoyed good health for the majority of the time after she
had the operation,'' Lancaster said. ``It was just in the last
couple of months that her condition deteriorated.''
	   Mrs. Thompson's husband, Peter, released a statement through the
hospital thanking friends, family and hospital staff for their
support throughout the years.
	   Details on Mrs. Thompson's other surviving family members were
not available, nor were funeral plans.

Disneyland tops Notre Dame as most popular tourist attraction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Where do tourists flock when they come to Paris?
Notre Dame? The Eiffel Tower? The Arc de Triomphe?
	   Yes, but even more are going to Disneyland.
	   The theme park outside Paris knocked Notre Dame out of first
place in the hearts of visitors to the capital last year, French
tourism officials said Monday.
	   Last year, Disneyland Paris drew 12.6 million visitors compared
to 12 million who visited Notre Dame, the Paris Regional Office of
Tourism said.
	   The theme park endured a shaky start six years ago.
	   But now, the make-believe world of Disney apparently has become
more compelling than France's real castles and cathedrals.
	   On a busy day, a wait at rides like Space Mountain and Big
Thunder Mountain can stretch to two hours _ even longer than the
wait to get to the top of the Eiffel Tower, now in third place with
5.7 million tourists last year.
	   The Louvre Museum and the Georges Pompidou Center followed with
5.1 and 4.4 million people respectively.
	   Paris also boasts a new tourist attraction: the Stade de France.
The gleaming national sports stadium where the French won the World
Cup in July has attracted 18,000 paying visitors, mostly French,
since it opened to the public Aug. 1.
	   A ticket costs 35 francs (dlrs 6), but most visitors opt for the
90-franc-ticket (dlrs 15) that gets them into the locker rooms.

Kenyans to ask Albright about aid; doubts raised about disaster
</HEADLINE>
fund &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Embassy Bombings &QL; 
 &UR; By SUSAN LINNEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenyan officials are expected to raise the
issue of victim compensation and aid for reconstruction when
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright meets them Tuesday to discuss
the bombing of the U.S. embassy.
	   But despite some claims that the Aug. 7 blast resulted in at
least 30 billion shillings (dlrs 500 million) in material and
commerical losses, no detailed estimate of damages has been drawn
up.
	   After the bombing in which 247 people, 12 of them Americans,
died, President Daniel arap Moi set up yet another disaster fund
managed and controlled by his office.
	   There is concern that this fund will turn out to be too much
like previous ones that collected money for other disasters, then
disappeared.
	   ``There is a track record on these disaster funds ... It is such
that it does not give confidence that this money is actually going
to where it is intended and that the operation is accountable,''
said Robert Shaw of the private Institute for Economic Affairs.
	   Chris Kirubi, an influential businessman and head of the Kenya
Manufacturers Association who has close ties with Moi's ruling
Kenya African National Union Party, is spearheading efforts to
establish a private sector fund ``that will work, that will have
accountability.''
	   ``We're doing the donkey work of setting up. We're trying to get
people to be on the board, to represent different interests,''
Kirubi said. ``We are interested even to join hands with the
government _ as long as their conditions meet our conditions.''
	   Joshua Matui, a senior official in Moi's office who is
coordinating the Bomb Blast fund, said he didn't know how much
money had been received into the bank account set up at the
state-owned National Bank of Kenya.
	   But he said although ``the modalities are still being worked out
... already we have started spending the money.''
	   Erastus Mwongera, another senior civil servant, said the Bomb
Blast fund had handed over 12 million shillings (dlrs 200,000) to
its funeral committee to pay for funeral and burial expenses and
had so far assisted in the burials of 125 of the 235 non-American
victims.
	   Following the 1994 sinking of a ferry boat in Mombasa in which
at least 300 people drowned, Moi's office set up a disaster fund.
Another was set up for street children, another for families whose
daughters died in a school fire in March, another for youth and
another for the disabled.
	   To date, there has been no public accounting for how the funds _
many of them ostentatious donations from government officials _
were spent.
	   Shaw pointed out that the bombing, however devastating and
shocking, was far from the worst disaster to strike Kenya this
year.
	   The El Nino weather phenomenon earlier in the year caused
widespread flooding and devastation in remote, underdeveloped
northeastern Kenya where more than 1,000 people died in the floods
or from the waterborne diseases that followed.
	   No fund was set up for victims there.
	   There is a strong tradition among the different peoples of Kenya
to pitch in and help members of their communities in times of need.
	   Called ``harambee'' _ the Swahili word for ``all pull
together,'' the practice is still very much in use. But all
participants know where the money is going _ and also how much
everyone else contributed.

Kohl expresses concern over ruble devaluation; stock markets
</HEADLINE>
nervous &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reports from additional markets, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl expressed concern
Monday over Russia's devaluation of the ruble, but said that any
negative impact could be mitigated through careful economic
policies.
	   Stock markets in countries like Germany with big stakes in the
Russian economy dipped on the news from Moscow, although the German
Dax stock index recovered, closing up 0.2 percent from Friday at
5456.58 points.
	   Share prices in some of Germany's biggest banks slipped,
however, making traders in neighboring countries like France and
Holland nervous as well.
	   German Finance Minister Theo Waigel warned that Russia's plan to
control capital flows must not jeopardize the trend toward open
capital markets.
	   ``Under no circumstances must the fundamental liberalization of
capital movement be questioned,'' Waigel said in a news release.
``Russia would hurt itself the most.''
	   Commercial bank stocks in Germany reacted immediately to the
devaluation. Their exposure to the Russian market totaled dlrs 30.4
billion at the end of 1997, according to the Bank for International
Settlements.
	   Commerzbank shares closed down 3.2 percent, and Dresdner Bank
shares slipped 2.8 percent. Deutsche Bank shares bucked the trend,
rising 1.4 percent.
	   Most of banks' outstanding credits, however, are guaranteed by
the German government.
	   A Finance Ministry spokeswoman said Russia's 90-day moratorium
on the payment of foreign credits could affect 500 million marks
(dlrs 280 million) in credits guaranteed by the German government.
	   Total German government credit guarantees to Russia, including
more than just commercial bank loans, totaled 84 billion marks
(dlrs 47 billion) at the end of 1997, the Finance Ministry said.
	   Elsewhere in Europe:
	   _The French market exhibited nervousness in part because of
German bank exposure in Russia. The CAC 40 index was down 11.10
points, or 0.3 percent to close at 3983.81 points.
	   _Prices on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange finished mostly lower,
with the AEX Index down 11.73 points, or 1 percent, as traders
reacted to the developments in Russia. Shares in major Dutch
companies were hit, including Unilever, which closed down 3.3
percent.
	   _The Stockholm bourse swung down after the news, but recovered
most of the drop during the day and ended with the general index
down only 0.2 percent.
	   _The Baltics took it a bit harder, reflecting that Russia is the
single largest market for each of these countries. The Tallinn
exchange was down 2.93 percent, Riga down 3.88 and Vilnius down
2.81.
	   _At the Helsinki Stock Exchange, companies that deal in
foodstuffs dropped 4 percent, and analysts predicted that chemical,
textile, clothing and electronics industries also would suffer if
the devaluation continues.
	   _Share prices on Milan's stock market fell sharply at first news
of the devaluation but ended the day up 335 points, or 1 percent.
Traders said Italian banks and companies have only limited exposure
in Russia, and expected the devaluation to have no major impact.
	   Some traders interpreted a slight increase in Fiat shares as a
result of the devaluation. The automaker is planning investments in
Russia, and the devaluation could make that cheaper.
	   _The Athens Stock Exchange's general share prices index closed
at 2,539.35 points, down 42.08 points, or 1.6 percent from Friday's
close.

Rogue trader Nick Leeson has 70 percent survival chance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Imprisoned securities trader Nick Leeson, who had
a cancerous tumor removed from his colon last week, has been given
a 70 percent chance of surviving for another five years, his
London-based lawyer said Monday.
	   Leeson, 31, was diagnosed with cancer Aug. 5 after serving more
than 2 1/2 years of a 6 1/2 year prison sentence in Singapore. He
was convicted of fraud and forgery that led to the 1995 collapse of
Barings Bank, Britain's oldest merchant bank.
	   Initial reports said the cancer had spread to his lymph nodes,
but lawyer Stephen Pollard said surgeons now believe that is not
the case.
	   ``The surgeon believes that the cancer has, happily, not spread
to the lymph nodes. No chemotherapy will therefore be necessary,''
Pollard said.
	   He faces a 30 percent chance of the cancer recurring within the
next two years, Pollard said.
	   ``This prognosis is not as good as we had hoped, nor as bad as
we had feared,'' the lawyer said.
	   Leeson, who is recovering in the prison ward of the New Changi
Hospital, has applied for early release from the Singapore prison.
	   Constitutionally, pleas for early release on compassionate
grounds are decided by President Ong Teng Cheong. Ong himself is
suffering from a recurrence of lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic
system.

Bosnich's xxxx
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Aston Villa's Australian goalkeeper
Mark Bosnich could face disciplinary action after an off-duty
policeman reported him for swearing at spectators during his team's
Premier League opener against Everton on Saturday.
	   Merseyside police confirmed Monday that soccer taskforce police
were investigating two complaints from fans against Bosnich after
the 0-0 draw at Goodison Park.
	   A police spokesman said it was unlikely Bosnich would be charged
but the incident would be reported to the Football Association.
	   One of the fans who complained was 49-year-old Tony Williamson,
who was at the match with his 11-year-old son. ``Bosnich should
know better. It was offensive and insulting behavior,'' he said.
``It was unacceptable and an awful impression to give to
children.''
	   Bosnich received a stern warning from the FA two years ago after
he made a Nazi-style salute during a match against Tottenham.
Bosnich later apologized.

 &UR; Bosnich reported for swearing at fans

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Aston Villa's Australian goalkeeper
Mark Bosnich could face disciplinary action after an off-duty
policeman reported him for swearing at spectators during his team's
Premier League opener against Everton on Saturday.
	   Merseyside police confirmed Monday that soccer taskforce police
were investigating two complaints from fans against Bosnich after
the 0-0 draw at Goodison Park.
	   A police spokesman said it was unlikely Bosnich would be charged
but the incident would be reported to the Football Association.
	   One of the fans who complained was 49-year-old Tony Williamson,
who was at the match with his 11-year-old son. ``Bosnich should
know better. It was offensive and insulting behavior,'' he said.
``It was unacceptable and an awful impression to give to
children.''
	   Bosnich received a stern warning from the FA two years ago after
he made a Nazi-style salute during a match against Tottenham.
Bosnich later apologized.

Poland's auditing chamber alleges mismanagement in last year's
</HEADLINE>
flood rescue &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Government auditors have concluded that
the reaction to last year's deadly floods was seriously hampered by
mismanagement, and have asked state prosecutors to open a criminal
investigation, the Polish news agency PAP reported Monday.
	   Auditors said the flood committee in the southern city of
Wroclaw issued a flood warning too late and had failed to circulate
updated evacuation plans. In one example, a municipality evacuated
620 cows and pigs to a farm that was later flooded because it never
received updated evacuation plans changing the site.
	   The former Wroclaw governor, Janusz Zaleski, and Wroclaw Mayor
Bogdan Zdrojewski, who headed the city and provincial flood
committees, denied any wrongdoing.
	   Auditors also asked investigators to look into flood committees
in Wlabrzych and Klodzko.
	   Officials convicted of neglecting their duties and causing
damages to public good face up to five years in prison.
	   The Wroclaw area was one of the worst hit by last July's floods
which killed 55 people, swamped 46,000 homes and caused an
estimated 12 billion zlotys (dlrs 3.4 billion) in damage.

Israeli bank robbing legend to get early prison release
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: FIXES typo in first word of lede &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A businessman turned bank robber whose
motorcycle getaways were legendary in Israel during the late 1980s
will be released early for good behavior, the prison authority said
Monday.
	   Roni Liebowitz, nicknamed the ``Bikerbank,'' became a popular
cult figure after claiming that robbing banks was the only way to
maintain a decent lifestyle in Israel.
	   Liebowitz, whose trademark was firing one shot in the air before
taking off on his bike, stole over 300,000 shekels (then about dlrs
175,500) in 22 heists.
	   In 1991, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison.
	   A parole committee this week found Liebowitz to be a model
prisoner and recommended an early release, prison authority
spokeswoman Orit Messer-Harel said.
	   She said Lebovitz would be paroled Sept. 2, after having served
half his sentence.

Security Council meets to consider Iraq response
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Responding to the latest confrontation
with Iraq, Security Council members considered Monday a
Japanese-drafted letter affirming the work of U.N. weapons
inspectors who have been banned from searching for evidence of
banned weapons.
	   With the low-key response, the council was trying to force Iraq
to make the next major move after its Aug. 5 decision to freeze
cooperation with U.N. weapons experts, diplomats said.
	   Weapons inspectors must certify that Baghdad has dismantled its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs, and its
long-range missiles, before the Security Council will lift
sanctions imposed after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990,
sparking the Gulf War.
	   The letter under consideration could give inspectors the
go-ahead to try to launch an inspection, which would test the Iraqi
resolve in enforcing its freeze, the diplomats said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Before adopting the draft, the council was to be briefed on
recent meetings between U.N. envoy Prakash Shah and Iraqi Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz, said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   Shah told reporters Thursday, after his first meeting with Aziz,
that he urged Baghdad change its mind and agree to cooperate with
arms monitors in their ongoing inspections.
	   Iraq froze cooperation with the United Nations after the chief
U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that
Baghdad had destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Despite the stalemate, Secretary-General Kofi Annan does not
plan to get personally involved as he did last February, when the
United States and Britain threatened to bomb Iraq if it didn't
allow inspectors access into certain presidential sites, Eckhard
said.
	   Annan brokered an accord that allowed inspectors access but ``he
personally does not foresee any role for himself at this time,''
Eckhard said.
	   The difference this time is that there is no threat of war, he
said.
	   Shah has kept Annan up to date with his progress in Baghdad and
has sent a report of his activities in Iraq to New York, U.N.
officials said. Rolf Knutsson, director of the U.N. office of
political affairs, was relaying Shah's report to the council
Monday.
	   Shah himself was expected to return to New York on Thursday,
Eckhard said.
	   The Japanese-drafted letter is to be sent to Butler and the head
of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, who
both reported last week that their work was being undermined by
Baghdad's decision.
	   Not only new inspections but ongoing monitoring of suspected
weapons sites was being affected, the inspectors told the council.
	   The council's letter would reaffirm the work of inspectors,
acknowledge that their mandate was being undermined and say that
Baghdad's decision was unacceptable, the diplomats said.

Ex-Soviet partisan arrested in Latvia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ A former Soviet partisan suspected of a
World War II massacre has been placed under arrest in Latvia, the
Baltic News Service reported Monday.
	   Vasily Kononov, 75, is suspected of murdering nine people,
including a pregnant woman and several children, during a raid
behind German lines in 1944, BNS said.
	   A spokesman for the Latvian prosecutor's office, Uldis Strelis,
told BNS that Kononov was facing war crimes charges. If convicted,
he could be sentenced to life in prison.
	   Latvia was occupied by the Soviet Union at the outbreak of World
War II, and then occupied by Nazi Germany in 1941. Soviet forces
retook the Baltic state in late 1944.
	   After Latvia regained independence in 1991, it vowed to
prosecute both Soviet and Nazi war criminals.
	   Ex-KGB official Alfons Noviks was the only Latvian resident to
be convicted of Soviet-era war crimes. He died in prison in 1996.
	   Some Jewish groups have criticized Latvia for not doing enough
to bring Nazi war criminals to justice.

Russia to test new container for storing nuclear waste
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will test a new container for storing spent
nuclear fuel on Tuesday, as it tries to improve the security of its
nuclear waste storage.
	   The metal-and-concrete container can be used to store up to 5
tons of nuclear waste for about 50 years, senior Atomic Energy
Ministry official Nina Yanovskaya said Monday, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The container will be tested at the Mednoye Ozero lake-side base
near St. Petersburg, she said.
	   Russia's methods of storing nuclear waste have been under
international scrutiny, especially since a retired naval officer
spoke out two years ago against the dangers posed by the careless
handling of the waste.
	   Capt. Alexander Nikitin has been charged with treason for his
aid to a Norwegian environmental group, the Bellona Foundation, in
compiling the report that focused on the potential hazards caused
by improper storage of radioactive waste by Russia's Northern
Fleet.
	   The United States and Norway helped finance development of the
new storage container, Yanovskaya said.

Palestinian police say they are close to catching detainee

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police are close on the trail of
escaped Hamas leader Imad Awadallah and have arrested three taxi
drivers who gave him rides, the West Bank security chief said
Monday.
	   Awadallah, a key figure in the Hamas military wing, escaped
Saturday from a Palestinian jail in the West Bank town of Jericho.
	   On Sunday, Palestinian security forces launched a massive
manhunt for Awadallah, conducting house-to-house searches in
Jericho and imposing a curfew.
	   The restrictions, which were not tightly enforced, were lifted
Monday after security officials said they were convinced Awadallah
was no longer in town.
	   ``All I can say is that he is not in Jericho,'' said Col. Jibril
Rajoub, head of the Palestinians' Preventive Security Service in
the West Bank. ``We will catch him.''
	   Rajoub said three taxi driver had been detained for giving
Awadallah a ride. Awadallah told the first driver that he needed to
get to his father who had a stroke, Rajoub said.
	   The driver took Awadallah for a short ride, but became
suspicious of him, and ordered him out somewhere in Jericho.
Awadallah spent the night in an abandoned house in Jericho, Rajoub
said and in the morning he got into another taxi which took him out
of the city.
	   Awadallah then got into a third taxi and was taken to another
destination. Rajoub did not provide further details to reporters.

Tournament to conclude six months after start
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Love taking lead &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) _ Six months after they were driven
off the course by torrential rain and strong winds, golfers on
Monday resumed the AT and T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am on a dry,
overcast morning.
	   Davis Love III, who tied for seventh in the PGA Championship
that ended Sunday, made an eagle on his third hole today to
temporarily take over the lead as the long-delayed tourney
concluded with its final round.
	   Love, starting at the 10th hole on the Poppy Hills course, moved
to 11-under with his eagle on the 531-yard, par-5 12th hole. He had
started his round with a birdie.
	   Fellow Americans Tom Watson and Tim Herron started the day tied
for the lead, but both slipped to 9-under with early bogeys.
	   Watson won the Pebble Beach tournament in 1977 and 1978. If he
wins this year, the two-decade separation between victories would
be a tourney record. Herron was last among the players who
completed all four rounds of the PGA Championship this past
weekend.
	   When the AT and T tournament began in late January, waves from
the Pacific Ocean were crashing onto the 18th fairway. Sheet-like
rain was turning sandtraps into water hazards and gusty winds were
snapping treetops.
	   Today, months after the demise of El Nino, the tourney resumed
on a dry morning on the Pebble Beach, Poppy Hills and Spyglass Hill
courses.

Auto workers accept settlement in South African strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Automobile manufacturers
conceded some wage demands to striking auto workers, settling a
6-day work stoppage on Monday.
	   The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa claimed a
victory for the second and third year of the wage agreement that
provides pay hikes above the cost-of-living increase.
	   Both sides had agreed to an 8 percent pay raise for the first
year, but manufacturers objected to the other demands.
	   The 21,000 auto workers will receive a 5 percent hike if
inflation is 3.9 percent or lower; and 7 percent if inflation
exceeds 5 percent, the union said.
	   ``Demanding better sustainable wages in the industry will result
in the lowering of poverty and increased purchasing power in the
poorer communities,'' the union said in a statement.
	   The settlement was proposed by mediators Friday and approved by
the rank- and-file on Monday.
	   Automobile Manufacturers Employers Organization chairman Brian
Smith said the agreement would help provide stability and
predictability in employment costs for the next three years.
	   NUMSA spokesman Tony Kgobe said workers lost about 4.2 million
rand (dlrs 666,000) in wages.
	   South African inflation has been more than 6 percent over the
past year.

Kenyans to ask Albright about aid; doubts raised about disaster

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenyan officials are expected to raise the
issue of victim compensation and aid for reconstruction when
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright meets them Tuesday to discuss
the bombing of the U.S. embassy.
	   But despite some claims that the Aug. 7 blast resulted in at
least 30 billion shillings (dlrs 500 million) in material and
commerical losses, no detailed estimate of damages has been drawn
up.
	   After the bombing in which 247 people, 12 of them Americans,
died, President Daniel arap Moi set up yet another disaster fund
managed and controlled by his office.
	   There is concern that this fund will turn out to be too much
like previous ones that collected money for other disasters, then
disappeared.
	   ``There is a track record on these disaster funds ... It is such
that it does not give confidence that this money is actually going
to where it is intended and that the operation is accountable,''
said Robert Shaw of the private Institute for Economic Affairs.
	   Chris Kirubi, an influential businessman and head of the Kenya
Manufacturers Association who has close ties with Moi's ruling
Kenya African National Union Party, is spearheading efforts to
establish a private sector fund ``that will work, that will have
accountability.''
	   ``We're doing the donkey work of setting up. We're trying to get
people to be on the board, to represent different interests,''
Kirubi said. ``We are interested even to join hands with the
government _ as long as their conditions meet our conditions.''
	   Joshua Matui, a senior official in Moi's office who is
coordinating the Bomb Blast fund, said he didn't know how much
money had been received into the bank account set up at the
state-owned National Bank of Kenya.
	   But he said although ``the modalities are still being worked out
... already we have started spending the money.''
	   Erastus Mwongera, another senior civil servant, said the Bomb
Blast fund had handed over 12 million shillings (dlrs 200,000) to
its funeral committee to pay for funeral and burial expenses and
had so far assisted in the burials of 125 of the 235 non-American
victims.
	   Following the 1994 sinking of a ferry boat in Mombasa in which
at least 300 people drowned, Moi's office set up a disaster fund.
Another was set up for street children, another for families whose
daughters died in a school fire in March, another for youth and
another for the disabled.
	   To date, there has been no public accounting for how the funds _
many of them ostentatious donations from government officials _
were spent.
	   Shaw pointed out that the bombing, however devastating and
shocking, was far from the worst disaster to strike Kenya this
year.
	   The El Nino weather phenomenon earlier in the year caused
widespread flooding and devastation in remote, underdeveloped
northeastern Kenya where more than 1,000 people died in the floods
or from the waterborne diseases that followed.
	   No fund was set up for victims there.
	   There is a strong tradition among the different peoples of Kenya
to pitch in and help members of their communities in times of need.
	   Called ``harambee'' _ the Swahili word for ``all pull
together,'' the practice is still very much in use. But all
participants know where the money is going _ and also how much
everyone else contributed.

Northern Ireland calls off soccer international after Omagh bomb
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes from manger and IFA official &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Ireland (AP) _ Wednesday's scheduled international
soccer friendly between Northern Ireland and Malta in Belfast was
called off Monday in the wake of the bombing in Omagh.
	   The Irish Football Association announced the move after
consulting with the government and the Malta Football Association.
	   ``We thought how can we have a friendly game of football after
this?'' Northern Ireland manager Lawrie McMenemy said. ``Nothing is
important after this, particularly a game of football.''
	   An under-21 international between the two countries scheduled
for Tuesday was also canceled as a mark of respect to the victims
of the bombing.
	   A car bomb killed 28 people and injured more than 220 when it
exploded in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh, 70 miles west of
Belfast, on Saturday.
	   It was the worst single terrorist attack in 30 years of conflict
in the province.
	   McMenemy said soccer was the last thing on his players' minds
after the bombing.
	   ``My stance normally is that football brings people together to
forget their problems, but this is so monumental that there is no
normality about anything this week,'' McMenemy said Monday.
	   IFA president Jim Boyce said his organization had never called a
game off because of a tragedy but on this occasion it would have
been wrong to go ahead.
	   ``To have people coming along to a game, where they are supposed
to enjoy themselves, while some of the funerals of the victims were
taking place would have been highly inappropriate,'' he said.
	   The Malta game was to be Northern Ireland's final warm-up match
before its opening European Championship qualifying match against
Turkey on Sept. 5.

Study says doctors often misread heart patients' end-of-life
</HEADLINE>
decisions &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release at 1900 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID KOENIG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ U.S. doctors often misjudge whether their heart
disease patients want to be resuscitated if their hearts stop, a
study found.
	   Doctors were wrong in one of every four cases when it came to
whether their patients with advanced heart disease wanted
resuscitation, according to the study, published in Tuesday's issue
of the journal Circulation.
	   The lead author of the study said it shows that doctors need to
talk to patients about end-of-life decisions.
	   ``When someone is critically ill and in the hospital, it's
difficult to broach this issue,'' said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a
professor at Yale University. ``We have to prepare for the worst
without extinguishing hope that they can live longer. It's a fine
balance and a difficult thing to do well.''
	   The researchers interviewed 936 heart patients at five hospitals
around the country. Sixty-nine percent wanted cardiopulmonary
resuscitation, while 23 percent preferred ``do not resuscitate''
orders if they went into cardiac arrest. This group tended to be
older, wealthier and pessimistic about their prognosis. The
remaining 8 percent were not sure what they wanted.
	   The researchers were able to ask the doctors of 750 of the 936
patients what they thought the patients preferred. In 24 percent of
the 750 cases, the doctors were wrong, most of the time in cases
where the patient did not want to be resuscitated.
	   Only one-fourth of the patients were even asked their feelings.
Oddly, Krumholz said, patients who did talk about resuscitation
with their doctors were just as likely to have their views
misunderstood.
	   The researchers cautioned that the patients and doctors were not
interviewed simultaneously, and some of the discrepancy between
patients' wishes and doctors' perceptions might be explained by
patients' changing their minds about whether they wanted to
resuscitated.
	   Patients with congestive heart failure often go through ups and
downs medically, and nearly one in five in the study changed their
minds after two months.
	   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Lynne Warner Stevenson,
director of a heart failure program at the Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, said there are subtle means by which doctors
can learn their patients' wishes.
	   ``It seems likely that the essence of the patient's preferences
may often be heard or solicited by an alert physician without
specifically mentioning a breathing machine,'' she said. ``There
are multiple approaches to such communication that may result in
the concordance of patient desire and physician care.''

UN chief says Tajik security situation limiting UN role
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned the
July 20 slayings of four U.N. workers in Tajikistan and urged both
sides Monday to implement their 1997 peace accord.
	   Annan's comments, in a report to the Security Council, came as
Tajik and opposition officials said the government had identified
four suspects and was negotiating with the opposition for their
arrest.
	   The victims, who worked for the U.N. Mission of Observers in
Tajikistan, were ambushed while on patrol in the mountains about 90
miles (140 kilometers) east of the capital Dushanbe. All were shot
in the head.
	   ``I cannot find words strong enough to condemn the murder of the
four members of UNMOT, who were on a mission of peace and were
unarmed,'' Annan wrote.
	   In his report, Annan said that the deaths, and a crisis sparked
by the government's decision to ban religious-based political
parties, ``highlight the continuing precariousness of the peace
process.''
	   The government subsequently revoked the provision.
	   ``I hope that the Tajik parties will muster the will and
determination to implement in good faith and at a steady pace the
general peace agreement they signed more than one year ago,'' Annan
wrote.
	   Tajikistan, which suffered through a five-year civil war and
borders Afghanistan, is one of several countries in Central Asia
that fears the growth of Islamic political movements.
	   The United Tajik Opposition protested the bill, since its
largest member, the Islamic Revival Party, would presumably have
been banned.
	   Annan also protested the proposed legislation, saying it could
undermine the 1997 peace accord between the government and the
largely Muslim opposition.
	   Sporadic clashes have also undermined the accord and the
security situation continues to impede U.N. operations, Annan
wrote. A special detachment for U.N. security, comprised of
government and opposition troops, has been formed but is still not
operational, he noted.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's deputy prime minister briefed the
Cabinet on his talks with the envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, the official Iraqi News Agency said Monday.
	   The Cabinet meeting was chaired by President Saddam Hussein, the
agency added.
	   It said Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz briefed the Cabinet of
his talks with Prakash Shah, Annan's envoy in Baghdad.
	   It gave no further details.
	   Earlier Monday, U.N. officials said Prakash sent a letter to
Annan, keeping him up to date with his progress in Baghdad.
	   Prakash returned to Baghdad on Thursday and in a meeting with
Aziz urged Iraq to allow arms monitors to continue their
inspections.
	   Iraq froze cooperation with the United Nations after the chief
U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that
Baghdad had destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Also Monday, Security Council members considered a
Japanese-drafted letter affirming the work of U.N. weapons
inspectors in Iraq.

 &UR; Albright leaves for Tanzania, Kenya &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with evidence being analyzed by FBI, edits to tighten &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURA MYERS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Maryland (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright headed to Africa Monday for a one-day visit to
Kenya and Tanzania to show support for bomb-struck embassy workers
and for East Africans caught in the terrorist attacks.
	   ``To America's embassy personnel in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, I
will bring a message of solidarity in their sorrow, admiration for
their courage and support for their continued efforts on behalf of
our country,'' Albright said before leaving. ``To the people of
Kenya and Tanzania, I will bring a message of friendship, made
deeper by our shared grief, and of support in doing all we can to
ease their suffering and help them start anew.''
	   Just ahead of Albright's trip, the State Department on Sunday
issued an updated ``worldwide caution'' to U.S. travelers in the
aftermath of the Aug. 7 bombings at American embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania and because of fresh threats to U.S. interests abroad.
	   An accompanying statement specifically warned ``against all
travel to Pakistan.'' The State Department also ordered the
departure of all non-emergency personnel and families of employees
from the embassy at Islamabad and from U.S. consulates in Karachi,
Lahore and Peshawar.
	   The warnings came after Pakistan handed over to Kenyan officials
a suspect in the U.S. Embassy bombings, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, also
known as Mohammad Sadiq Howaida and Abdull Bast Awadh.
	   The first batch of evidence from the Nairobi bombing arrived
over the weekend at the FBI lab at the bureau's Washington
headquarters and is being analyzed, FBI officials said Monday.
	   Many more shipments are expected, but the first batch contained
cotton swabs taken at the blast site in hopes of picking up
microscopic residues that could positively identify what the bomb
was made of. A U.S. official said last week that field tests
suggested the presence of a Czech-made plastic explosive called
Semtex that has been used by terrorist groups before.
	   Albright's visit to East Africa was designed in part to
demonstrate U.S. resolve in the face of growing terrorist threats
to Americans.
	   Some Kenyans have complained that after the Nairobi bombing,
rescuers gave priority to finding American victims and to
protecting evidence at the expense of saving African lives. But
Albright and other U.S. officials have strongly disputed that
notion, saying the priority had been rescuing all possible, African
and American.
	   On Friday, when Albright set aside vacation plans for the
hastily planned trip to East Africa, the State Department had
lifted a warning against travel to Kenya, whose economy relies
heavily on foreign visitors, to further ease any strain in the
aftermath of the tragedy.
	   Albright, after a 16-hour flight, is scheduled to spend only
five hours on the ground in Dar es Salaam, her first stop Tuesday
morning, and then about 5 1/2 hours in Nairobi later in the day
before returning immediately home without an overnight rest.

	   VISTA HERMOSA, Colombia (AP) _ Nervous police still guard rubble
left from an assault by leftist guerrillas who flattened their
barracks with everything from mortar fire to a homemade tank built
from a tractor and a steel garage door.
	   Combat raged all night and an officer was killed repelling the
April rebel attempt to take this forlorn town that has suddenly
moved center stage as Colombia's new president tries to end a
34-year civil war.
	   Now all that bravery may have been in vain.
	   President Andres Pastrana, who took office this month, is
offering the country's most powerful guerrilla army the opportunity
to walk back into Vista Hermosa, about 110 miles (175 kilometers)
south of the capital, Bogota, without firing a shot.
	   The prospect is worrying residents in this and four other
southern municipalities. Pastrana plans to demilitarize by November
to create a secure venue where peace talks can be held with the
15,000-member Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC.
	   ``There are people who want to leave town because they're
afraid,'' said town secretary Jaidy Pedreros. ``But if we're to
have peace someday we're going to have to make a sacrifice.''
	   Pastrana last week reaffirmed his decision to pull government
forces from the towns, which together comprise a 16,200-square-mile
(41,960 square-kilometer) swath of high-rent savannah _ twice the
size of El Salvador _ where farmers graze cattle, plant rice,
plantains and tropical fruits, and grow coca, the raw material for
cocaine.
	   Military leaders have warned against the move, saying the FARC
will take advantage to strengthen its stranglehold on southeastern
Colombia while expanding the cocaine trade that yields ``war
taxes'' for the rebels, their largest income source.
	   Those concerns have multiplied. On the eve of Pastrana's Aug. 7
inauguration, rebels destroyed a major anti-narcotics base, killing
as many as 143 police and soldiers and capturing 129 more. At least
35 more soldiers have died in a four-day battle in northern jungles
that continued Monday.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Yelena Bochet's eyes opened wide behind her thick
glasses as she read the figures posted at a currency exchange booth
where the Russian ruble just plunged 34 percent against the dollar.
	   ``I already can afford little more than a loaf of bread and a
pack of milk on my pension of 350 rubles a month,'' the 68-year-old
pensioner said, her wrinkled face overcome with emotion. ``I don't
know how I will get by now when all the prices will soar.''
	   Russia's government announced the 33.7 percent ruble drop Monday
after trying to hold off for months, fearing just the kind of
reaction visible outside the booth on Moscow's Novy Arbat street.
	   A small crowd gathered, gazing at the new rate posted there _
9.5 rubles to the dollar _ and fuming at the government and
President Boris Yeltsin.
	   On Sunday, Bochet might have gotten about dlrs 55 for her 350

	   BUNIA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to oust President
Laurent Kabila on Monday consolidated their gains in the east and
warned the political leaders in their movement not to repeat the
mistakes of the embattled Congolese head of state.
	   ``I told them I will personally shoot them one by one if they
steal money and isolate themselves from the people,'' said rebel
chief Jean-Pierre Ondekane. ``Then, there will be a third
revolution.''
	   On Monday, Ondekande flew from his eastern stronghold at Goma
360 kilometers (225 miles) north to Bunia, a hot and dusty trading
town on the border with Uganda.
	   Bunia fell to the rebels last week without a fight, local
commander Bob Ngoy told several reporters who accompanied Ondekane.
He said troops loyal to Kabila scattered, leaving their weapons
behind.
	   Thousands of residents who gathered to listen to Ondekane's pep
talk _ it was his first appearance in Bunia _ showed little
enthusiasm.
	   The 36-year-old career military officer, who served in the
forces of longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko before going over to
Kabila's rebels nearly two years ago, spoke for two hours, and then
took questions from the curious crowd.
	   Asked whether he, like Kabila, would declare himself president
after a rebel victory, he replied in Swahili, the lingua franca of
eastern Congo:
	   ``I am not a politician, I am a soldier. What will happen next
to this country depends on who are you going to choose as your
leaders.''
	   Some in the crowd were openly skeptical.
	   ``I don't understand what this is all about. It's the army, not
people, doing it,'' one man said.
	   Ondekane's warning to the politicians in the rebellion, who on
Sunday formed the Congolese Democratic Coalition _ a kind of
government-in-waiting complete with eight cabinet posts _ was
further evidence that the two-week-old rebellion is spearheaded by
the military.
	   Like Ondekane, the others in the 60,000-strong rebel force
reportedly closing in on the capital, Kinshasa, are also
disgruntled officers and soldiers who served under Mobutu and
intially supported Kabila's rebellion. But as Kabila consolidated
his power, they felt increasingly marginalized _ and were not paid.
	   Kabila claims Rwanda and Uganda are supporting the rebels with
equipment and troops, a charge Ondekane denies.
	   But Ali Agume, a trader from Arua across the border in Uganda,
said he had seen Ugandan troops and tanks alongside the rebels in
Bunia.
	   Ondekane said the rebels were approaching Mbanza-Ngungu, 120
kilometers (75 miles) southwest of Kinshasa.
	   They already control Muanda and Kitona air base near the
Atlantic Coast, and Congo's only ocean-going port, Matadi, on the
Congo River, as well as the Inga power plant that supplies
electricity to the capital, southern Congo and northern Zambia.
	   When Kabila began his rebellion in October 1996 that eventually
ousted Mobutu eight months later, it took his forces three months
to capture the territory the current crop of rebels holds after two
weeks.

Ukraine's currency falls sharply on news of Russian ruble plunge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's hryvna currency fell sharply on
Monday in response to a decision by the government of neighboring
Russia to let the ruble drop dramatically.
	   The hryvna fell to 2.1805 to the U.S. dollar at Ukraine's main
Interbank Currency Exchange, down from 2.1435 to the dollar on
Friday.
	   The trading was conducted late in the evening following an early
morning ban by the Central Bank on selling or buying rubles and
dollars at the exchange.
	   The ban was sparked by an announcement from the Russian Central
Bank that it would permit the value of the ruble to fall about 34
percent _ from about 6.3 to the dollar to 9.5 to the dollar.
	   The trading at the exchange was suspended early in the morning
when the ruble started to fall sharply after its supply topped 8
million rubles, with demand practically absent.
	   After hours of suspense, the National Bank postponed trading in
rubles until Tuesday and allowed trade in dollars.
	   The hryvna's sharp fall came amid wide speculation that the
Russian government's decision to devalue the ruble would
immediately exert negative pressure on the Ukrainian currency by
increasing foreign investors' mistrust in the country's financial
markets, which are considered highly dependent on those of Russia.
	   President Leonid Kuchma ordered Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoitenko and central bank chief Viktor Yushchenko to take
unspecified measures to maintain the stability of the country's
financial system and prevent the hryvna from falling.
	   No concrete measures were immediately announced.
	   The hryvna has been falling steadily this year under strong
pressure from foreign investors who were withdrawing their money
from the country.
	   Efforts by the National Bank to defend the currency resulted in
a sharp fall in its reserves from dlrs 2.34 billion at the
beginning of the year to dlrs 1.15 as of last week.
	   The hryvna sank to 2.14 to the U.S. dollar last week, but still
remains in the currency fluctuation band of 1.8 to 2.25 to the
dollar, which was announced by the government for 1998.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl expressed concern
Monday over Russia's devaluation of the ruble, but said that any
negative impact could be mitigated through careful economic
policies.
	   Stock markets in countries like Germany with big stakes in the
Russian economy dipped on the news from Moscow, although the German
Dax stock index recovered, closing up 0.2 percent from Friday at
5456.58 points.
	   Share prices in some of Germany's biggest banks slipped,
however, making traders in neighboring countries like France and
Holland nervous as well.
	   German Finance Minister Theo Waigel warned that Russia's plan to
control capital flows must not jeopardize the trend toward open
capital markets.
	   ``Under no circumstances must the fundamental liberalization of
capital movement be questioned,'' Waigel said in a news release.
``Russia would hurt itself the most.''
	   Commercial bank stocks in Germany reacted immediately to the
devaluation. Their exposure to the Russian market totaled dlrs 30.4
billion at the end of 1997, according to the Bank for International
Settlements.
	   Commerzbank shares closed down 3.2 percent, and Dresdner Bank
shares slipped 2.8 percent. Deutsche Bank shares bucked the trend,
rising 1.4 percent.
	   Most of banks' outstanding credits, however, are guaranteed by
the German government.
	   A Finance Ministry spokeswoman said Russia's 90-day moratorium
on the payment of foreign credits could affect 500 million marks
(dlrs 280 million) in credits guaranteed by the German government.
	   Total German government credit guarantees to Russia and other
parts of the former Soviet Union totaled 84 billion marks (dlrs 47
billion) at the end of 1997, the Finance Ministry said.
	   Elsewhere in Europe:
	   _The French market exhibited nervousness in part because of
German bank exposure in Russia. The CAC 40 index was down 11.10
points, or 0.3 percent to close at 3983.81 points.
	   _Prices on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange finished mostly lower,
with the AEX Index down 11.73 points, or 1 percent, as traders
reacted to the developments in Russia. Shares in major Dutch
companies were hit, including Unilever, which closed down 3.3
percent.
	   _The Stockholm bourse swung down after the news, but recovered
most of the drop during the day and ended with the general index
down only 0.2 percent.
	   _The Baltics took it a bit harder, reflecting that Russia is the
single largest market for each of these countries. The Tallinn
exchange was down 2.93 percent, Riga down 3.88 and Vilnius down
2.81.
	   _At the Helsinki Stock Exchange, companies that deal in
foodstuffs dropped 4 percent, and analysts predicted that chemical,
textile, clothing and electronics industries also would suffer if
the devaluation continues.
	   _Share prices on Milan's stock market fell sharply at first news
of the devaluation but ended the day up 335 points, or 1 percent.
Traders said Italian banks and companies have only limited exposure
in Russia, and expected the devaluation to have no major impact.
	   Some traders interpreted a slight increase in Fiat shares as a
result of the devaluation. The automaker is planning investments in
Russia, and the devaluation could make that cheaper.
	   _The Athens Stock Exchange's general share prices index closed
at 2,539.35 points, down 42.08 points, or 1.6 percent from Friday's
close.

Sinn Fein dissident's son arrested over Omagh atrocity
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police arrested the son of a
leading Sinn Fein critic Monday on suspicion he helped commit
Northern Ireland's worst-ever terrorist attack, a car bomb in a
small town that killed 28 people from all sides of society.
	   Police took Shane Mackey, 19, and four other people at dawn from
their homes near Omagh, scene of Saturday's blast, 70 miles (110
kms) east to Belfast. Under British anti-terrorist law they can be
interrogated for up to a week before being released or charged.
	   Dubbed the ``Real IRA,'' the defectors and their novice recruits
have been blamed for planting car bombs in several Northern Ireland
towns this year, but never before with such horribly lethal effect.
They oppose the IRA ceasefire, and the support of its political
ally, Sinn Fein, for the Northern Ireland peace accord.
	   At Stormont, the British government's headquarters in Northern
Ireland, police and military chiefs from both parts of Ireland
plotted how to rout Irish Republican Army dissidents.
	   Mo Mowlam, Britain's minister responsible for governing Northern
Ireland, and the Irish Republic's justice minister, John
O'Donoghue, also attended the four-hour security conference at
Stormont in east Belfast.
	   Afterward Mowlam announced increased army and police deployments
along the border between the two states, but said she wouldn't
reveal other details, ``because it would be stupid.''
	   When asked whether both governments were discussing whether to
change their laws so that Real IRA suspects could be convicted
based only on testimony from anti-terrorist detectives, she said:
``You're in the right ballpark.''
	   Convicting even high-profile militants of belonging to one of
Northern Ireland's many outlawed paramilitary groups has usually
been impossible to prove.
	   In Omagh, the young suspect's father, local councilman Francis
Mackey, emphasized that the attack was a ``terrible tragedy'' _ but
steadfastly refused to condemn the bombers.
	   He said his son had been arrested as part of a British
conspiracy ``to demonize me for being honest and open in expression
of my political opinions.''
	   Mackey, re-elected by the area's militant Catholics last year
while still a member of Sinn Fein, resigned after party leaders
formally accepted April's compromise Belfast agreement on how
Northern Ireland should be governed.
	   He now aligns himself with an anti-agreement group called the 32
County Sovereignty Committee led by Bernadette Sands-McKevitt, wife
of the martyred IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands _ and common-law
wife of the Real IRA's reputed commander.
	   Like his diehard colleagues, Mackey opposes the agreement's
acknowledgement that Northern Ireland's six counties should
continue to exist as a Protestant-majority state linked with
Britain so long as most citizens here want that.
	   He has previously said that the IRA cease-fire of July 1997 was
misguided, but refused to discuss this Monday.
	   ``No amount of words from me will in any way alleviate the
suffering of the bereaved and the injured,'' Mackey said.
	   And the full horror of Omagh began to sink in Monday as police
confirmed the identities of all but one of the dead, among them two
baby girls aged 18 and 20 months old.
	   Of 220 wounded, 108 remained in hospitals across Northern
Ireland, 11 in critical condition. Many others were crippled or
blinded.
	   Unlike most attacks in Northern Ireland, the dead came from both
sides of the religious divide and from every political allegience.
They included Sinn Fein supporters as well as moderate Catholics, a
Protestant activist of the Ulster Unionist Party, and a niece of
Omagh's most hard-line Protestant politician.
	   ``This is not a crime against any particular section of our
people, Protestant or Roman Catholic,'' said the Democratic
Unionist politician, Oliver Gibson, whose niece Esther perished
with the rest.
	   ``This was a bid to destroy an entire community,'' he said,
noting that he knew most victims by first name.
	   For the first time in the three-decade course of Northern
Ireland's conflict, foreign tourists were among the dead _ a
teacher and 12-year-old student from Spain.
	   Spain's deputy prime minister, Francisco Alvarez Cascos, toured
Omagh with relatives of the dead and 11 wounded Madrid students,
including two girls hospitalized in Belfast's Royal Victoria
Hospital with critical head injuries.
	   ``There is good and evil everywhere,'' said Helguero Peuch,
mother of one of the most seriously injured Spanish girls,
9-year-old Beatrez.
	   Two days on, Saturday's horrors are coming back to haunt
survivors and rescuers alike.
	   A Catholic bus driver, Mickey McAnally, described his nightmare
journey to the hospital with a cargo of screaming wounded and
severed body parts. He marshaled walking wounded into his bus, then
carried a few with missing or maimed arms and legs.
	   ``You could feel the warmth of their blood coming through your
clothes,'' he said, noting he had to coax onto the bus two Spanish
girls bleeding ``head to toe,'' who didn't want to go without a
missing friend.
	   A Protestant father, Michael Gallagher, recalled in a wrenching
interview with BBC television his overnight wait to learn whether
his missing 21-year-old son, Adrian, had survived.
	   Gallagher _ whose brother was shot dead by the IRA in 1984 _
said he'd already concluded Adrian was dead when the social workers
and police escorted him to visit Omagh's makeshift morgue.
	   At the entrance, he said, his fists clenched and his voice
falling to a desperate whisper, ``I really wanted to run ... to get
out and run away.''

Rwandan police chief pleads innocent to genocide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A former Rwandan military police officer
pleaded innocent Monday to crimes of genocide in his initial
appearance before the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda,
the tribunal said.
	   Alphonse Nteziryayo has been jointly charged with Sylvain
Nsabimana with crimes associated with the 1994 genocide in Rwanda
in which at least half a million people, most of them minority
Tutsis, were slaughtered. Nsabimana also has pleaded innocent.
	   Nteziryayo, who was arrested April 24 in Ouagadougou, Burkina
Faso, entered his innocent plea to all six charges against him in a
trial chamber composed of Presiding Judge Laity Kama and Judges
Yakov Ostrovsky and Navanethem Pillay. Counsel Titinga Frederic
Pacere from Burkina Faso is defending him, the tribunal said.
	   The tribunal is holding 31 genocide suspects in this northern
Tanzania town.
	   Nteziryayo succeeded Nsabimana as police chief in Butare, the
major town in southern Rwanda, in June 1994 and is alleged to have
ordered and participated in the killing of all the Tutsis who had
survived earlier killings.
	   The slaughter began April 6 after President Juvenal Habyarimana,
a Hutu, died when his plane was shot down on approaching to land in
the Rwandan capital, Kigali.
	   Nteziryayo is also alleged to have supervised the training of a
militia, distributed weapons and publicly called for the killing of
all Tutsis.
	   The tribunal has indicted 35 people for their role in the
state-orchestrated genocide.
	   A Tutsi-led rebel force ousted the Hutu extremist government and
ended the killings in July 1994.

One bomb, one moment: Three generations of a family die in
</HEADLINE>
carbombing &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Northern Ireland &QL; 
 &UR; By KRISTIN GAZLAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AUGHER, Northern Ireland (AP) _ One minute, they were shopping
on a Saturday afternoon. The next minute, three generations of a
family were gone.
	   Townspeople say it was family that mattered most to 30-year-old
Avril Monaghan, pregnant with twins, and it was family she died
with in the Omagh carbombing _ her 18-month-old daughter Maura and
her 65-year-old mother, Mary Grimes.
	   ``The family have strong faith,'' said the Rev. Lawrence Dawson,
the Catholic parish priest who will preside Tuesday over the
funerals of Avril and her daughter. ``It's the only way you can
cope with this kind of problem.''
	   Mrs. Monaghan lived in the rolling green hills above Augher with
her husband, Michael. He makes his living as a carpenter; she found
work as a secretary. But, mostly, she was a mother, raising a son
and three daughters, the oldest 6 years old.
	   A widely published picture shows Mrs. Monaghan grinning at her
groom on her wedding day, a crown of flowers resting on her dark
hair.
	   Dawson said Mrs. Monaghan, who attended Mass with her children
the last morning of her life, was a stalwart contributor to the
church, helping organize functions at the parish school and putting
together quizzes for the students.
	   It is almost impossible for the 700 souls of Augher and nearby
Clogher, where the family sometimes attended church, to accept the
triple blow the Monaghan and Grimes clans have suffered, he said.
	   That pain stretches the 20 miles (32 kms) north to Beragh, where
Mrs. Grimes _ who had 10 other children _ lived with her husband
Mick, a dairy farmer.
	   Mrs. Grimes will be buried, probably Wednesday, in Beragh, and
the two Monaghans in the cemetery ringing St. Macartan's Catholic
Church, perched high on a hill not far from the house Michael
Monaghan had built for them.
	   The running of that house has been taken over by the Monaghans'
neighbors, who are providing a steady stream of food and other
practical support, which ``leaves the family just to grieve,''
Dawson said.
	   Michael Monaghan was doing about as well as could be expected
for a man who lost his wife and his youngest child, the priest
said.
	   One resident in Augher said Monaghan initially tried not to
worry when word came about the carnage in nearby Omagh, about 70
miles (110 kms) west of Belfast. Family and friends urged Monaghan
to drive to the scene to search for his wife, but he kept repeating
the same phrase over and over, with lessening conviction: ``She'll
ring, she'll ring.''
	   Louise McGirr, a clerk at the Costcutter store where Mrs.
Monahan shopped that last morning, offered a happier memory from
that day, though it still brought tears to her eyes in the telling.
	   Chubby-cheeked little Maura Monaghan, outfitted in pigtails and
purple shorts, took a lollilop from the candy shelves and started
to walk out without paying. Her mother sternly suggested her
daughter not do that, whereupon Maura reached for her pockets to
hide the lollipop away _ only to find her shorts didn't have any.
	   Ms. McGirr remembers how mother and daughter were laughing as
they left the store, on their way to just another shopping day in
Omagh.
	   She didn't even bother to say goodbye.

IOC anti-doping chief assails Samaranch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The head of the International Olympic Committee's
anti-doping campaign has sharply criticized IOC president Juan
Antonio Samaranch for proposing a reduction in the list of banned
drugs.
	   In an article published Monday in the French daily Le Figaro,
Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the IOC medical commission, said
the IOC should continue its drive to stop the use of doping
substances and strive to standardize doping regulations and improve
education.
	   De Merode said he was shocked by Samaranch's recent comments,
made in a Spanish newspaper interview, in which he called for a
drastic reduction in the list of banned drugs and suggested that
only drugs which are harmful to health should be prohibited.
	   ``The president can have his opinions,'' de Merode told Le
Figaro. ``I do not understand, and they make me aghast.''
	   The IOC president ``was always against doping and supported the
action of the commission. How can we believe that he supports a
reduction in the list at the same time that we have, in a short
period, completely managed the problem?''
	   ``People who want to reduce the list are the people who want to
let doping function,'' he said.
	   De Merode said that Samaranch, who is Spanish, is backing the
philosophy of many doctors in Spain.
	   Some Spanish doctors ``have rejected the ethics of their
profession,'' de Merode said. ``One must not forget that Spanish
sports, for a long time, has had tendencies toward doping. A
president of the Spanish athletics federation has even been
excluded because he refused to select athletes who hadn't taken
doping substances!''
	   It was no coincidence that a Spansh team _ Festina _ was thrown
out of the Tour de France for systematic drug use, de Merode added.
	   De Merode's comments come just three days before the IOC
executive board is due to meet to discuss the growing drug scandals
in sports. The IOC has scheduled a worldwide anti-doping summit in
January.
	   In recent weeks, the Tour de France was dominated by revelations
of drug taking, Olympic gold medal swimmer Michelle Smith was
suspended for four years for manipulating a urine sample, U.S.
athletes Randy Barnes and Dennis Mitchell were suspended after
positive tests, and AS Roma coach Zdenek Zeman implied that illegal
drug taking was rife in Italian soccer's Serie A.
	   Drug scandals continued Monday when it emerged that French
customs officials seized products from the Cofidis cycling team
north of Bordeaux last week.
	   ``The current mess is unacceptable,'' said de Merode, who has
been head of the IOC's anti-doping commision for more than 30
years.
	   De Merode said that he was not surprised at the revelations of
drug taking at the Tour de France.
	   ``We were talking about that for a long time,'' he said. ``Now
we know that the problem is real, that there is systematic
doping.''
	   ``When I hear a rider say `I have never been tested positive so
I am not taking drugs,' that makes me smile.''
	   Still, de Merode said that the Tour's anti-doping effort had
controlled the taking of banned substances among cyclists.
	   Now, sports federations need to redouble their efforts to crack
down on drug taking, he said.
	   ``Some people say `it is acceptable to prohibit four products:
anabolic steroids; testosterone; EPO; and growth hormones.' But
that only opens the doors to all forms of doping.''
	   The fight against ``minor'' hormones must continue, he said.
	   De Merode agreed that detecting the use of banned drugs was a
tough task.
	   Sports bodies have spent six years trying to combat EPO and
three looking to detect growth hormones, he said.
	   But the battle against testosterone is close to success, he
said.
	   When asked who is responsible for doping, Merode said: ``The
athletes themselves cannot be absolved in any cases. You don't give
something to someone who doesn't want it.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's deputy prime minister briefed
President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi Cabinet Monday on talks with
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy, the official Iraqi News
Agency said.
	   INA gave no further deatils of Tariq Aziz's account of his talks
with Prakash Shah.
	   Earlier Monday, U.N. officials said Prakash sent a letter to
Annan with his account of his meetings.
	   Prakash arrived in Baghdad Thursday with a message from Annan
urging Iraq to allow arms monitors to continue their inspections.
	   Iraq froze cooperation with the United Nations after the chief
U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that
Baghdad had destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Also Monday, Security Council members considered a
Japanese-drafted letter affirming the work of U.N. weapons
inspectors in Iraq.

Ikea founder's life detailed in new book
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad is going
public about his own life in a new book, but vows to keep his
company private.
	   Kamprad gave author Bertil Torekull access to Ikea archives and
participated in long interviews for Torekull's book on the
furnishings giant, which was released Monday.
	   The book, whose Swedish title is ``The History of Ikea _ Ingvar
Kamprad Recounts,'' contains two chapters dealing with Kamprad's
involvement with Nazism. In 1994, a Swedish newspaper reported he
had attended Nazi meetings in 1945-48, which Kamprad quickly
admitted and said he regretted.
	   ``Now I have told all I can,'' he said at a book-release
ceremony at an Ikea store in suburban Stockholm. ``Can one ever get
forgiveness for such stupidity?''
	   The book also contains details about his struggles with alcohol
and his successes and failures in business.
	   He told the Swedish news agency TT on Monday that he is
determined to keep close hold of the company.
	   ``Would one be daring enough to make decisions involving
billions of kronor if we were forced to come to the stock exchange
and report a profit every quarter?'' he said.
	   Ikea plans to expand into Russia and Kamprad said he isn't
deterred by Russia's decision Monday to devalue the ruble. ``In
Russia, people need millions of small apartments, and an Ikea
speciality is in how to live in a small space,'' he said.

England captain supports Hoddle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BURNHAM BEECHES, England (AP) _ England soccer captain Alan
Shearer came out in support Monday of embattled England coach Glenn
Hoddle.
	   The Newcastle striker, who was in camp with England's squad
preparing for the Sept. 5 Euro 2000 qualifier against Sweden, said
Hoddle's controversial World Cup diary was ``straight forward.''
	   ``I didn't think any of my confidences were broken,'' Shearer
said from the team hotel at Burnham Beeches.
	   Sections of the British media called for Hoddle to resign as
England coach after excerpts of his book ``The 1998 World Cup
Story'' were serialized in the Sun newspaper.
	   He was condemned for breaching the trust of his players.
	   In the book, Hoddle revealed how Paul Gascoigne went beserk
after being told he had been dropped from the English World Cup
squad and also criticized other players.
	   England vice-captain Paul Ince admitted over the weekend that
some players might find it difficult to trust Hoddle in future but
Shearer couldn't see what all the fuss was about.
	   ``I have read all the extracts relating to me, as well as
several other bits which caught my eye as I went along,'' he said.
``It seemed fairly straight forward to me.''
	   ``Everyone else named in the book will want to read the parts
that are relevant to them and form their own views but, when they
do, I doubt if there will be any real problem,'' he added.
	   England's Football Association has backed the England manager
amid the controversy and has reportedly renewed its bid to sign
Hoddle to a long-term contract securing him for the 2002 World Cup.
	   ``Ideally a new contract should be sorted out very quickly and
it should give us a long period of stability right the way through
to the next World Cup,'' an FA spokesman said Monday.

 &UR; With Embassy Bombings &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to lede with disaster fund &QL; 
 &UR; By SUSAN LINNEE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenya's government has set up a disaster
fund for victims of the bombing of the U.S. embassy, but there is
concern it may turn out to be too much like previous money-raising
efforts that disappeared, unaccounted, into the bureaucracy.
	   After the Aug. 7 bombing, which killed 247 people, President
Daniel arap Moi set up a disaster fund managed and controlled by
his office _ raising concerns that money collected would disappear,
as it had done with previous disasters.
	   ``There is a track record on these disaster funds ... It is such
that it does not give confidence that this money is actually going
to where it is intended and that the operation is accountable,''
Robert Shaw of the private Institute for Economic Affairs said
Monday.
	   Chris Kirubi, an influential businessman and head of the Kenya
Manufacturers Association who has close ties with Moi's ruling
Kenya African National Union Party, is spearheading efforts to
establish a private sector fund ``that will work, that will have
accountability.''
	   ``We're doing the donkey work of setting up. We're trying to get
people to be on the board, to represent different interests,''
Kirubi said. ``We are interested even to join hands with the
government _ as long as their conditions meet our conditions.''
	   There is a strong tradition among the different peoples of Kenya
to pitch in and help members of their communities in times of need.
	   Called ``harambee'' _ the Swahili word for ``all pull
together,'' the practice is still very much in use. But all
participants know where the money is going _ and also how much
everyone else contributed.
	   Not so government-led relief efforts.
	   Following the 1994 sinking of a ferry boat in Mombasa in which
at least 300 people drowned, Moi's office set up a disaster fund.
Another was set up for street children, another for families whose
daughters died in a school fire in March, another for youth and
another for the disabled.
	   To date, there has been no public accounting for how the funds _
many of them ostentatious donations from government officials _
were spent.
	   Joshua Matui, a senior official in Moi's office who is
coordinating the Bomb Blast fund, said he didn't know how much
money had been received into the bank account set up at the
state-owned National Bank of Kenya.
	   But he said although ``the modalities are still being worked out
... already we have started spending the money.''
	   Erastus Mwongera, another senior civil servant, said the Bomb
Blast fund had handed over 12 million shillings (dlrs 200,000) to
its funeral committee to pay for funeral and burial expenses and
had so far assisted in the burials of 125 of the 235 non-American
victims.
	   Shaw pointed out that the bombing, however devasting and
shocking, was far from the worst disaster to strike Kenya this
year.
	   The El Nino weather phenomenon earlier in the year caused
widespread flooding and devastation in remote, underdeveloped
northeastern Kenya where more than 1,000 people died in the floods
or from the waterborne diseases that followed.
	   No fund was set up for victims there.
	   Compensation for the bombing victims and aid for reconstruction
is likely to be raised by Kenyan government officials who meet with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Tuesday.
	   No detailed estimate of damages has been drawn up, but some
claims go as high as 30 billion shillings (dlrs 500 million) in
material and commerical losses. Shaw and others feel the figure is
far too high.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Fifteen months ago to the day, an
exuberant Laurent Kabila was in the southern Congolese city of
Lubumbashi, where he declared himself president of this vast
central African country. Back in Lubumbashi on Monday, Kabila is
now struggling for his government's survival.
	   After weekend meetings with Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos
Santos in that country's capital of Luanda, Kabila briefly returned
to his embattled capital and then headed to Lubumbashi to continue
his efforts to rally support against an advancing rebel army.
	   In recent weeks, Kabila has been traipsing from Cuba to southern
Congo to Angola looking for friends to help hold off the rebels _
an army of his former Rwandan allies, ethnic Tutsi fighters and
disaffected members of the president's own military.
	   But back in Kinshasa, tension was again mounting amid a second
city-wide power outage since the rebellion began and growing rumors
over the stability of the ruling regime.
	   The rebels _ who are believed to be between 150 kilometers (95

Yorke disappointed after Manchester United deal falls through
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Dwight Yorke is committed to staying
at Aston Villa this season but says he is disappointed transfer
negotiations with Manchester United broke down.
	   The Trinidad and Tobago striker was targeted in the off-season
by United manager Alex Ferguson, who reportedly offered Villa a 10
million pound (dlrs 16.25 million) transfer deal.
	   Yorke figured in Ferguson's attempt to lure a key striker to Old
Trafford and was first choice when the other candidate, Dutch
striker Patrick Kluivert, elected to stay at Italian club AC Milan.
	   However, Villa boss John Gregory rejected the approaches from
Manchester United, saying the offer was not big enough.
	   ``I would have liked to have joined Manchester United,'' Yorke
said Monday. ``Opportunities like this only come along once in a
lifetime and I had asked John Gregory and the Villa board for their
understanding.''
	   The 26-year-old striker has told Gregory he will not stay at
Villa beyond the remaining two years of his contract.
	   ``Regardless of what happens now, I won't sign a new contract
and I won't leave before my current contract expires in 2000,'' he
said.
	   ``I don't want Villa fans to see me as disloyal. I would ask
every supporter to think what they would do if they were offered
another job which they would really like to do.''

Amid unrelenting financial turmoil, Russia lets ruble drop

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After spending billions of dollars over the past
three months to prop up Russia's weak currency, the government gave
up on Monday and let the ruble's value drop by up to 34 percent.
	   Russians have already been hit hard by the country's fiscal
troubles, which have robbed many of their salaries for months. The
drop in the currency is an even harsher blow for rank-and-file
consumers, as it will increase the prices of imports that which
account for a large percentage of Russian consumer goods, including
groceries.
	   Russia's 1,500 banks, will also suffer, and up to half are
expected to go belly-up in the next few weeks.
	   The government-sanctioned drop in the currency is likewise
expected to shake foreign investors, whose confidence in the
government's ability to overcome the crisis has already been
shrinking steadily. Prices on European markets dropped on the news
that the government would let the ruble's lower limit sink 33.7
percent, from 6.3 to 9.5 to the dollar _ or from about 15.873 cents
to 10.526 cents.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko insisted that the ruble's new
lower limit ``does not mean a devaluation of the ruble'' _ the step
that government officials have sworn repeatedly they would not
allow.
	   Nevertheless, the move was a concession of defeat in the one
area where Russia's often painful economic reforms had yielded an
achievement that financial analysts and consumers alike could feel:
keeping the ruble steady and inflation low.
	   But the price of defending this feat had become too high,
Kiriyenko and Central Bank President Sergei Dubinin said in a joint
statement explaining the government's new exchange rate policy.
	   The new rate will help combat ``speculative attacks'' on the
ruble ``that have led to unjustified spending of the currency
reserves of the Bank of Russia,'' the statement said.
	   Those reserves had dropped this month to about dlrs 17 billion _
even including last month's multibillion dollar loan from the
International Monetary Fund.
	   The Russian government blamed the difficult economic situation
on the Asian financial crisis and a recent drop in the world price
of oil, Russia's biggest export earner. Already, the government has
introduced an austerity program to close the huge gap between
government revenues and spending, and secured a dlrs 22.6 billion
bailout from international organizations led by the IMF. But
sagging investor confidence hasn't improved.
	   U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin urged the Russian
government to ``move quickly to take actions to restore confidence,
including the adoption of a careful and cooperative approach to
dealing with its creditors and the full implementation of the ...
stabilization program agreed with the IMF.''
	   President Boris Yeltsin, who had cut short his vacation and
returned to his country residence outside Moscow, decided Sunday to
let the ruble sink during a meeting with Kiriyenko and Anatoly
Chubais, the president's envoy to international lending
organizations, presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   After meeting Monday with senior IMF negotiator John
Odling-Smee, Chubais told reporters that he had held phone talks
with the U.S. Treasury over Russia's market meltdown, but couldn't
assess the chances of direct aid from Washington. He said that the
IMF was unlikely to accelerate the disbursement of Russia's loans
or pledge additional loans to the government.
	   Immediate public reaction to the announcement was muted, with
some Russians approaching exchange booths only to turn back when
they saw the massive increase.
	   ``It was hard to survive before on my pension,'' said pensioner
Yelena Bochet, 68. ``But now I simply don't know what to do because
all the prices will certainly soar.''
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov denounced the de facto
devaluation as a ``full-scale bankruptcy'' of Yeltsin's government.
	   A ruble devaluation had been widely rumored, in part because the
government faces heavy payments on ruble-denominated debt in coming
days and weeks. The government also said it would halt payment on
government treasury bills and impose a 90-day moratorium on
payments of foreign debt.
	   Chubais insisted that the government was not defaulting.
	   ``We are not reneging on our debts,'' he said. ``We realize that
many of our partners will feel uncomfortable, but any hesitation on
our part would cost them far more.''
	   The main currency exchange suspended dollar trades last week, so
it was not possible to fix a new market rate for the ruble.
	   The Russian Trading System stock index ended the day down 4.2
percent, to close at 109.45, compared to 115.0 at the close of
trading Friday. Volume was at a trickle most of the day.
	   The drop in the ruble was also expected to lead to the collapse
of many Russian commercial banks, which are over-dependent on
now-devalued ruble assets. The government and Central Bank said
they would pool the resources of the country's 12 leading banks,
which account for the majority of the country's private deposits,
to limit the damage.
	   Chubais promised that the government would do ``everything
possible'' to guarantee private deposits at the state-owned savings
bank, Sberbank.
	   In what appeared to be an attempt to bring foreign investors
back to Russia, Yeltsin promoted respected tax chief Boris Fyodorov
deputy prime minister in charge of macro-economic issues and
international debt. Long a darling of foreign investors, Fyodorov
had been fired from his job as finance minister in the early years
of Russia's reforms.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Envoy Christopher Hill pursued
Monday an American diplomatic initiative to set up talks between
the Serbian government and ethnic Albanian officials on the future
of Kosovo.
	   A decline in fighting revived hopes that negotiations stalled
since May might be resumed. Fehmi Agani, the top ethnic Albanian
negotiator, wrote to his Serbian counterpart Ratko Markovic, saying
the Albanians wanted the talks to resume, on the condition that
Serbs halt their offensive.
	   However, such negotiations may not be successful because they
are boycotted by ethnic Albanian opposition parties and the Kosovo
Liberation Army fighting for independence of the Serbian province.
	   An American diplomatic source said a meeting in Belgrade between
Hill and Serbian officials was meant to ``keep this momentum to
resume negotiations.''
	   He referred to the announcement last week of an ethnic Albanian
negotiating team that contains only associates of pacifist leader
Ibrahim Rugova, who also wants Kosovo's independence but is
despised by the KLA.
	   No details of the meeting were revealed. Belgrade's state-run
Tanjug news agency reported that after the meeting between Serbian
President Milan Milutinovic and Hill's team participants expressed
hope a dialogue would resume to resolve the Kosovo crisis.
	   Fighting ebbed Monday in the restive province, following a
weekend push when Serbian forces captured a series of key Albanian
strongholds.
	   Tanjug said Monday Serbian police had ``crushed'' KLA bases in
the villages of Lodja, Grabovac and Rausic, all on the outskirts of
the province's second city of Pec on Sunday.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported sporadic
fighting and shooting in the border area near Junik, apparently
mop-up operations after government forces took control of the
village, formerly a major guerrilla stronghold.
	   The center also accused Serbs of setting ablaze parts of the
villages from which the armed militants were purged. A total of
50,000 civilians remain displaced in the border area, it said.
	   In the province of Kosovo, Albanians account for 90 percent of
the population of 2 million.
	   Meanwhile, the two sides exchanged allegations of atrocities.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said an official of Rugova's
Democratic League of Kosovo died in a Pristina hospital after being
beaten by police in a prison of his hometown Urosevac, 35
kilometers (20 miles) to the south.
	   Conversely, Tanjug said the mutilated bodies of two Serb
policemen missing since July 6 were found Monday in Lodja when
government forces forced KLA rebels to retreat there.
	   Another policeman, wounded in the same village July 6 but
evacuated and hospitalized, died Monday in the main military
hospital in Belgrade, it said.
	   Two other Serbian policemen were killed on Sunday and Monday in
different parts of Kosovo on Sunday and Monday, the pro-government
Serbian Media Center in Pristina reported.
	   The attacks on villages have left tens of thousands of refugees
camped in the woods in western Kosovo. The U.N. refugee agency
based in Geneva, said in a statement Monday it rushed a convoy to
Pec, where refugees who fled earlier fighting reportedly came under
attack and were forced south into the mountains.
	   The U.N. now estimates that more than 231,000 people have been
uprooted in the six months since the conflict began. Many of them
have fled across the mountainous border with Albanian, where the
KLA also maintains bases.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian police on the trail of escaped
Hamas leader Imad Awadallah have arrested three taxi drivers who
gave him rides, the West Bank security chief said Monday.
	   Awadallah, a key figure in the Hamas military wing, escaped
Saturday from a Palestinian jail in the West Bank town of Jericho.
	   On Sunday, Palestinian security forces launched a massive
manhunt for Awadallah, conducting house-to-house searches in
Jericho and imposing a curfew.
	   The restrictions, not tightly enforced, were lifted Monday after
security officials said they were convinced Awadallah was no longer
in town.
	   ``All I can say is that he is not in Jericho,'' said Col. Jibril
Rajoub, head of the Palestinians' Preventive Security Service in
the West Bank. ``We will catch him.''
	   Rajoub said three taxi driver had been detained for giving
Awadallah a ride. Awadallah told the first driver that he needed to
get to his father who had a stroke, Rajoub said.
	   The driver took Awadallah for a short ride, but became
suspicious of him, and ordered him out somewhere in Jericho.
Awadallah spent the night in an abandoned house in Jericho, Rajoub
said and in the morning he got into another taxi which took him out
of the city.
	   Awadallah then got into a third taxi and was taken to another
destination. Rajoub did not provide further details to reporters.

Americans told to seriously consider leaving Pakistan

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Americans in Pakistan have lived
through wars with neighboring India, anti-U.S. fervor during the
Gulf War and the murders of their compatriots. But even those used
to living with danger say there's something different about the
latest U.S. warning to get out.
	   ``It's a bit more severe,'' said development consultant Marilee
Kane, expressing quiet amazement that the U.S. Embassy was moving
so quickly to send its own non-essential staff away, and urging so
strongly that other U.S. citizens to follow.
	   Americans in Pakistan learned of the warning Monday morning,
just over a week after the deadly bombings at two U.S. embassies in
East Africa.
	   Facing an auditorium filled with 100 or so U.S. business people,
aid workers, missionaries and diplomats, Ambassador Thomas Simons
acknowledged Monday that the State Department had been unusually
firm in urging the estimated 6,700 Americans living throughout
Pakistan to ``consider seriously departing Pakistan.''
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland said all but about 50 of
120 people in the embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Karachi,
Lahore and Peshawar were leaving. They, their families and the
families of essential staff will fly out Tuesday morning for
Brussels.
	   ``My advice would be to be careful, but don't panic,'' Simons
told non-embassy Americans.
	   There was no panic at the question-and-answer session Simons
held for the American community in Islamabad. But there were sharp
questions from many, including a woman who wanted to know ``what
we're running away from?''
	   The ambassador cited only a ``pattern of threats'' since the
simultaneous bombings Aug. 7 of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania that killed 257 people and
injured thousands.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad has withstood bloody assaults,
though none as serious as those in East Africa. A mob incensed at
the rumor U.S. forces were attacking Muslim holy places in Saudi
Arabia attacked and burned the Islamabad embassy in 1979, killing
two American and two Pakistani employees.
	   The embassy compound now resembles a not-unpleasant federal
prison, hidden from the street by a 3-meter (10-foot) brick wall
topped with rolls of barbed wire. Concrete barricades slow traffic
on surrounding streets.
	   An U.S. Christian missionary recalled Americans leaving
predominately Muslim Pakistan during the 1991 Gulf War. U.S.
intervention to reverse Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was seen by some
in Pakistan and elsewhere as proof of Washington's desire to
control the Muslim world.
	   Other Americans have lived here long enough to recall the
tension with foreigners and Pakistanis alike during Pakistan's wars
with India in 1965 and 1971.
	   Sunday, the Pakistani government said a suspect in the African
bombings had been caught trying to slip from Nairobi through
Pakistan to neighboring Afghanistan. He was sent back to Nairobi
for questioning by U.S. and Kenyan agents. The move could anger
some in Pakistan, but Simons said the warning to Americans was not
directly linked to the transfer.
	   Simons also dismissed the possibility the U.S. was planning to
use Pakistan as a staging ground for an attack on a terrorist
leader holed up in neighboring Afghanistan who has been identified
as a possible suspect in the African bombings. Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz said Monday his country had not been asked to
facilitate such an attack.

Sale of young elephants criticized by chiefs, experts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A Botswana-based environmental
group Monday criticized the legal capture and sale of 30 young
elephants from Botswana's Tuli Reserve.
	   Sekai, a branch of the Tuli Lion Trust, said in a statement
released in Johannesburg that the four to seven year-old elephants
were taken from their family groups and sold to a wild animal
trader in Botswana's southern neighbot, South Africa.
	   Under the Convention for International Trade in Endangered
Species (CITES), the elephant export was legal, the statement said.
The trade was carried out between the landowners of the Tuli
Reserve, the Botswana Department of Wildlife and National Parks and
the animal trader.
	   The elephants were sold for 12,000 rand (dlrs 1,904) each.
	   Tribal headmen and chiefs in the Tuli area complained in the
statement that they were not consulted and that they would seek to
prevent capture of another 20 young elephants targeted for sale.
	   Kenya-based elephant specialist Daphne Sheldrick, who runs an
orphanage for baby elephants outside Nairobi, said in the statement
that she was appalled by the trade.
	   ``A mother elephant that loses her baby will suffer all the
grief and misery of the loss of a loved one, as would a human
mother under such circumstances,'' she said.

Russia's Islamic leaders seek to prevent spread of fundamentalism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Islamic leaders from Russian republics in the
North Caucasus on Monday formed an organization aimed at countering
the spread of Islamic extremism in the region, a news agency
reported.
	   Most residents of Russia's Caucasus regions traditionally
practice a moderate version of Islam. But extremist movements,
especially Wahhabism, recently have been on the rise and have been
blamed for violence in several parts of the former Soviet Union.
	   The new organization has declared as its purpose the
stabilization of the situation in the North Caucasus, and
countering the spread of fundamentalism, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   ``The Wahhabi movement is a plague introduced to split Islam,''
Chechnya's Mufti Hajji Akhmad Kadurov was quoted as saying.
	   Besides Chechnya, the group includes Islamic leaders from
Russia's republics of Dagestan, Ingushetia, Kabardino-Balkaria,
Karachayevo-Cherkessia and North Ossetia, ITAR-Tass reported. They
decided to set up the organization's headquarters in Ingushetia's
capital Nazran.

Radical Basque party breaks with custom to lament Omagh bomb 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The political party linked to armed Basque
separatist group ETA broke with its custom of not condemning bomb
attacks when it issued a statement Monday saying it lamented the
car-bomb blast in the Northern Ireland this weekend that killed 28
people.
	   Herri Batasuna said it wished to convey its condolences to those
injured and to the families of those killed in the Omagh bomb blast
Saturday which it described as an attack on the Irish peace
process.
	   Sometimes compared to the Sinn Fein party of Northern Ireland
which is linked to the IRA armed group, Herri Batasuna has never
condemned any of the attacks carried out by ETA in its 30-year
campaign for a Basque state independent of Spain.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, is blamed for the deaths of nearly 800 people since
1968. Twenty-three executive board members of Herri Batasuna were
jailed last year after being convicted of collaborating with ETA.
	   The party, whose name stands for ``Our Country'' and which has
close ties with Sinn Fein, praised what it described as the
``political maturity'' of Northern Ireland's politicians following
the Omagh blast and said it hoped Spanish and Basque politicians
could show a similar maturity and initiate a peace process to end
the Basque conflict.

Americans told to seriously consider leaving Pakistan

 &UR; With Embassy Bombings

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Americans in Pakistan have lived
through wars with neighboring India, anti-U.S. fervor during the
Gulf War and the murders of their compatriots. But some say there's
something different about the latest U.S. warning to get out.
	   ``It's a bit more severe,'' said development consultant Marilee
Kane, expressing quiet amazement that the U.S. Embassy was moving
so quickly to send its own non-essential staff away, and urging so
strongly that other U.S. citizens to follow.
	   Americans in Pakistan learned of the warning Monday morning,
just more than a week after the deadly bombings at two U.S.
embassies in East Africa.
	   Facing an auditorium filled with 100 or so U.S. business people,
aid workers, missionaries and diplomats, Ambassador Thomas Simons
acknowledged Monday that the State Department was unusually firm in
urging the estimated 6,700 Americans living throughout Pakistan to
``consider seriously departing.''
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Hoagland said all but about 50 of
120 people in the embassy in Islamabad and consulates in Karachi,
Lahore and Peshawar were leaving. They, their families and the
families of essential staff will fly out Tuesday morning for
Brussels.
	   ``My advice would be to be careful, but don't panic,'' Simons
told non-embassy Americans.
	   There was no panic at the question-and-answer session Simons
held for the American community in Islamabad. But there were sharp
questions from many, including a woman who wanted to know ``what
we're running away from?''
	   The ambassador cited only a ``pattern of threats'' since the
simultaneous bombings Aug. 7 of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, that killed 257 people and
injured thousands.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad has withstood bloody assaults,
though none as serious as those in East Africa. A mob incensed at
the rumor U.S. forces were attacking Muslim holy places in Saudi
Arabia attacked and burned the Islamabad embassy in 1979, killing
two American and two Pakistani employees.
	   The embassy compound now resembles a federal prison, hidden from
the street by a 3-meter (10-foot) brick wall topped with rolls of
barbed wire. Concrete barricades slow traffic on surrounding
streets.
	   An U.S. Christian missionary recalled Americans leaving

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ As the anniversary of Princess Diana's death in
Paris approaches, 70 percent of French people want a street or
plaza to be named after her, according to a survey.
	   In the Gallup poll, to be published in Tuesday's France-Soir
newspaper, 26 percent of respondents were against the idea, and 4
percent had no opinion.
	   Diana was killed last Aug. 31 in a car crash in the Pont de
l'Alma traffic tunnel. Since then, a makeshift memorial has formed
at the nearby Flame of Liberty, originally set up to honor
French-American ties. Visitors are mainly tourists.
	   The poll was conducted by telephone Aug. 13-14 among 1,002
people over the age of 15. Margins of error for such polls are
usually plus or minus 2-3 percentage points.

Government denies report that prime minister has cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's government dismissed a newspaper
report Monday that claimed Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's
wobbly walk at the national Independence Day parade showed he was
suffering from cancer.
	   A front-page report Monday in The Asian Age newspaper claimed
Vajpayee was making regular visits to a New Delhi referral center
purportedly for a bone scan. ``The prime minister is suspected to
have a tumor in the prostrate gland,'' the report said.
	   ``(The) report may make colorful reading for those who delight
in denigrating the prime minister of India by casting unfounded and
motivated aspersions on his health, but it does great disservice to
the readers, not to mention the fact that it defames Shri Atal
Bihari Vajpayee,'' a spokesman for Vajpayee said in a letter to the
paper's editor.
	   ``He has no medically confirmed symptoms of any ailment, leave
alone a prostrate tumor,'' said the letter, a copy of which was
faxed to news agencies.
	   Sunday's newspapers splashed pictures of Vajpayee's wobble after
he took the salute at the main Independence Day parade on Saturday
in New Delhi. The prime minister had to be supported by his
security guards.
	   An official spokesman said Saturday that Vajpayee suffered ``a
momentary muscle pull in the lower back.''
	   But The Asian Age said it was a sign of prostrate cancer, adding
its symptoms are physical weakness, a slight drop in blood pressure
and problems in walking.
	   It said the prime minister was being treated at the Sitaram
Bhartiya Institute, ``the best place in Delhi for a bone scan.''
The report said a bone scan was not done on a patient unless a
tumor was suspected.
	   It added Vajpayee had had a kidney removed in 1987 because of a
tumor.
	   The spokesman's letter confirmed one of Vajpayee's kidneys was
removed in 1986 on medical advice. It said the operation was widely
known and had not come in the way of a hectic public life.

Tournament to conclude six months after start
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Furyk taking lead; Edits to conform. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PEBBLE BEACH, California (AP) _ Six months after they were
driven off the course by torrential rain and strong winds, golfers
on Monday resumed the AT and T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am on a
dry, overcast morning.
	   Jim Furyk, who missed the cut in his last two tournaments, had
an eagle on the sixth hole of the Pebble Beach course to
temporarily take over the lead as the long-delayed tourney
concluded with its final round.
	   Furyk, who started the day two strokes behind co-leaders Tom
Watson and Tim Herron, moved to 12-under to take a two-stroke lead
over four players. Watson and Herren dropped to 9-under.
	   Furyk tied for fourth in the British Open last month, but has
struggled since then. He missed the cut this weekend at the PGA
Championship.
	   Fellow Americans Davis Love III, Tom Watson and Tim Herron each
lead earlier in the day.
	   Watson won the Pebble Beach tournament in 1977 and 1978. If he
wins this year, the two-decade separation between victories would
be a tourney record. Herron was last among the players who
completed all four rounds of the PGA Championship this past
weekend.
	   When the AT and T tournament began in late January, waves from
the Pacific Ocean were crashing onto the 18th fairway. Sheet-like
rain was turning sandtraps into water hazards and gusty winds were
snapping treetops.
	   On Monday, months after the demise of El Nino, the tourney
resumed on a dry morning on the Pebble Beach, Poppy Hills and
Spyglass Hill courses.
	   Of the 168 pros who started the tournament, 135 were expected to
return to Pebble Beach for the final round.
	   Among those not returning were Tiger Woods, who finished the
second round 14 strokes off the lead, and fellow American Jack
Nicklaus. Also dropping out was Vijay Singh of Fiji, who won the
PGA Championship Sunday near Seattle.
	   The AT and T tournament chartered a plane to take players from
Seattle to Monterey Sunday night. Those continuing to the next tour
stop, the International in Denver, will get another chartered
flight Monday night.
	   PGA Tour officials said it's the first time a portion of a
tournament has been played, then completed months later.
	   The tournament was washed out after two rounds in 1996, making
it the first PGA Tour event that could not be completed since 1949.
	   Players managed to squeeze in two soggy rounds in late January,
and organizers reduced the event to 54 holes. But heavy rains wiped
out play 1 1/2 hours after tee-off Feb. 1, and again Feb. 2 when
officials tried to extend it to Monday.

Prime minister seeks evidence of bribe-taking by aides
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee sought evidence Monday for accusations that a media baron
bribed his close associates to have the country's top economic
offenses investigator transferred from his job.
	   The charges ``merit immediate attention,'' Vajpayee's top aide
Brajesh Mishra said in a letter to Jayaram Jayalalitha, a powerful
southern Indian leader who props up the government with crucial
parliamentary support but is growing restive in the alliance.
	   Jayalalitha alleged Sunday that M.K. Bezbaruah, who headed the
Enforcement Directorate, was transferred from his job because the
owners of a ``well-known group of publications'' had ``paid hefty
bribes to persons very close to the prime minister,'' Monday's
newspapers said.
	   Jayalalitha did not name the newspaper group. Ashok Jain,
proprietor of the mass-selling Times of India newspaper, has been
charged by the Directorate with violating India's foreign exchange
laws. Jain has denied the charges, and he did not immediately react
to Jayalalitha's allegation.
	   The reply from Vajpayee's office was part of weeks-old sparring
between his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and
Jayalalitha, who faces several charges of financial wrongdoing
doing an earlier tenure as the top elected official of the southern
Tamil Nadu state.
	   Jayalalitha got bad press last week when her reported threat to
pull down the government was linked to an administrative revamp in
which the government transferred top officials _ some investigating
cases of corruption and foreign exchange violations against her.
	   Jayalalitha denied she had anything to do with the transfers,
urged the government to reinstate Bezbaruah and issued the bribery
accusation. The prime minister's office said Sunday the charges
were baseless.
	   The main opposition Congress Party demanded a probe into the
accusation, and a regional party opposed to Jayalalitha demanded
Vajpayee's resignation over the issue.
	   Jayalalitha, whose Tamil regional group is one of the 19 parties
in the governing coalition, has repeatedly threatened to pull out
of the government over several local issues. She has not carried
out her threat so far.
	   Her All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazagham and four local
allies together have 30 lawmakers whose support is crucial for
Vajpayee's government in the 545-member federal Parliament.
	   On Thursday, Jayalalitha announced she would stay in Vajpayee's
government after nearly all the lawmakers supporting her warned
against the move.
	   Minutes after the meeting, Vajpayee moved Bezbaruah, the chief
investigator of her cases, to the transport department saying his
expertise was wanted there.

Report: Istanbul's spice market explosion caused by a bomb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Investigators now suspect a bomb planted
by Kurdish rebels caused last month's deadly explosion at
Istanbul's centuries-old spice market, Turkey's semiofficial
Anatolia news agency said Monday. The blast killed seven people and
injured more than 100.
	   Officials initially thought a faulty gas canister at a food
stand caused the July 9 explosion, although the possibility of a
bomb was never ruled out.
	   Independent NTV television reported that 21 people were being
detained in Istanbul, suspected of helping to place the bomb at the
entrance of the spice market. Anatolia put the number of suspects
held at 15, and said they were Kurdish rebels.
	   Kurdish guerrillas have been fighting for autonomy in Turkey's
southeast since 1984: An estimated 37,000 people have died in the
conflict. Rebels have claimed responsibility for several attacks on
tourist sites.
	   Istanbul's head of police was expected to make an official
announcement on Tuesday. Officials were unavailable for comment
late Monday.
	   The 17th-century spice market, known in Turkey as the Egyptian
market, is located near the Blue Mosque and Istanbul's renowned
covered bazaar. The covered market_ offering exotic food, spices
and dried fruits in hundreds of stands _ is a favorite stop on most
tourist itineraries.

After rebel setbacks, diplomats try to set up negotiations

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with U.S. envoy meeting Serbs, Albanians,
Serbs accusing each other of atrocities &QL;

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Envoy Christopher Hill pursued
Monday an American diplomatic initiative to set up talks between
the Serbian government and ethnic Albanian officials on the future
of separatist Kosovo province.
	   A decline in fighting Monday revived hopes that negotiations
stalled since May might be resumed. Fehmi Agani, the top ethnic
Albanian negotiator, wrote to his Serbian counterpart Ratko
Markovic, saying the Albanians wanted the talks to resume, on the
condition that Serbs halt their offensive.
	   However, such negotiations may not be successful because they
are boycotted by ethnic Albanian opposition parties and the Kosovo
Liberation Army fighting for independence of the south Serbian
province.
	   An American diplomatic source said a meeting in Belgrade between
Hill and Serbian officials was meant to ``keep this momentum to
resume negotiations.''
	   He referred to the announcement last week of an ethnic Albanian
negotiating team that contains only associates of pacifist leader
Ibrahim Rugova, who also wants Kosovo's independence but is
despised by the KLA.
	   No details of the meeting were revealed. Belgrade's state-run
Tanjug news agency reported that after the meeting between Serbian
President Milan Milutinovic and Hill's team participants expressed
hope a dialogue would resume.
	   The ebb in fighting followed a weekend push when Serbian forces
captured a series of key Albanian strongholds.
	   Tanjug said Monday that Serbian police ``crushed'' KLA bases in
the villages of Lodja, Grabovac and Rausic, all on the outskirts of
the province's second city of Pec on Sunday.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported sporadic
fighting and shooting in the border area near Junik, apparently
mop-up operations after government forces took control of the
village, formerly a major guerrilla stronghold.
	   The center also accused Serbs of setting ablaze parts of the
villages from where the armed militants were purged. A total of
50,000 civilians remain displaced in the border area, it said.
	   Albanians account for 90 percent of the population of 2 million
in Kosovo.
	   Meanwhile, the two sides exchanged allegations of atrocities.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said an official of Rugova's
Democratic League of Kosovo died in a Pristina hospital after being
beaten by police in a prison of his hometown Urosevac, 35
kilometers (20 miles) to the south.
	   Conversely, Tanjug said the mutilated bodies of two Serb
policemen missing since July 6 were found Monday in Lodja where
government forces forced KLA rebels to retreat.
	   Another policeman, wounded in the same village July 6 but
evacuated and hospitalized, died Monday in the main military
hospital in Belgrade, it said.
	   Two other Serbian policemen were killed on Sunday and Monday in
different parts of Kosovo on Sunday and Monday, the pro-government
Serbian Media Center in Pristina reported.
	   The attacks on villages have left tens of thousands of refugees
camped in the woods in western Kosovo. The U.N. refugee agency
based in Geneva, said in a statement Monday it rushed a convoy to
Pec, where refugees who fled earlier fighting reportedly came under
attack and were forced south into the mountains.
	   The United Nations estimates more than 231,000 people have been
uprooted in the six months since the conflict began. Many of them
have fled across the mountainous border with Albanian, where the
KLA also maintains bases.

Croatia star Robert Jarni signs for Real Madrid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Croatia's World Cup star Robert Jarni
signed a three-season contract Monday with Spanish European
Champion side Real Madrid.
	   The deal ended speculation over the future of the midfielder who
decided to leave Spanish club Betis last month and had reached a
deal to sign for English club Coventry.
	   The 29-year-old, however, changed his plans in recent weeks when
Real Madrid began expressing interest in his services.
	   Jarni arrived in the Spanish capital on Sunday and passed a
medical test early Monday after which he put his name to a
three-season contract,a club official said. There no details
available regarding the financial terms of the deal.
	   The official could not comment on whether Madrid would have to
pay any money to Coventry as part of the signing.
	   At Real, Jarni will join fellow countryman Davor Suker, the 1998
World Cup's top scorer with six goals. Both players helped Croatia
finish third in the competition on defeating the Netherlands 2-1.

Opposition: Taliban bombs injure children

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Taliban bombs hit the opposition
stronghold of Bamiyan in central Afghanistan on Monday, injuring
three children, an opposition source said.
	   Spokesman Azizullah Shashaq of the Hezb-e-Wahadat militia also
claimed an opposition victory Monday. He said that after heavy
fighting, his militia reclaimed the town of Khawjah Ghuar, just
north of the Takhar provincial capital of Talqor that the Taliban
recently captured. Khawjah Ghuar has an airport, making it an
important prize.
	   There was no confirmation Khawjah Ghuar changed hands, and no
confirmation of the bombing of Bamiyan, 100 kilometers (60 miles)
east of the capital, Kabul. Shashaq had no details on casualties
beyond the three children he said were wounded.
	   In southern Afghanistan, Taliban spokesman Abdul Hay Muttayn
said Taliban leaders met Monday with an Iranian delegation seeking
information about 11 missing Iranians, including diplomats. Iran
has accused Taliban forces of seizing the 11 when they captured
Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   The loss of Mazar-e-Sharif, about 300 kilometers (190 miles)
north of Kabul was a major blow to the northern-based opposition
alliance, and one of several recent victories for the Taliban. The
Taliban, who profess an extreme version of Islam, could soon
control all of Afghanistan. They have held the capital since 1996.
	   Taliban officials reiterated Monday that they were not holding
the missing Iranians and did not know where they could be found,
Muttayn said.
	   The independent human rights group Amnesty International raised
the missing Iranians and several other issues in a statement
Monday, calling on the Taliban to allow independent monitoring of
the human rights situation in Afghanistan.
	   Amnesty's chief concern were reports Afghans from minority
ethnic and religious groups were being killed or harassed as the
Taliban consolidated control over Afghanistan.
	   ``The Taliban's refusal to allow independent monitoring of the
situation in the northern areas of Afghanistan _ following the fall
of Mazar-e-Sharif and several other major towns to the Taliban last
week _ could serve to conceal the human rights violations in the
area,'' Amnesty said.
	   Also Monday:
	   _President Boris Yeltsin ordered his border chief to Tajikistan
to ensure that the former Soviet Union's southern borders were
secure following recent Taliban victories. The former Soviet
republics of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, now part of
the Commonwealth of Independent States, fear a complete Taliban
victory could send an influx of refugees and weapons across their
borders.
	   _A committee comprising Taliban, United Nations and independent
aid group representatives met for the first time in Kabul to try to
resolve a dispute over relocating the aid groups to war-damaged
dormitories in the capital.
	   Aid workers were expelled from Kabul nearly a month ago after
refusing Taliban orders to move. A U.N. spokesman said Monday it
was difficult to determine to what extent health and other
conditions in Kabul had deteriorated since the aid workers
departed.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Taliban bombs hit the opposition
stronghold of Bamiyan in central Afghanistan on Monday, injuring
three children, an opposition source said.
	   Spokesman Azizullah Shashaq of the Hezb-e-Wahadat militia also
claimed an opposition victory Monday. He said that after heavy
fighting, his militia reclaimed the town of Khawjah Ghuar, just
north of the Takhar provincial capital of Talqor that the Taliban
recently captured. Khawjah Ghuar has an airport, making it an
important prize.
	   There was no confirmation Khawjah Ghuar changed hands, and no
confirmation of the bombing of Bamiyan, 100 kilometers (60 miles)
west of the capital, Kabul. Shashaq had no details on casualties
beyond the three children he said were wounded.

Stuntman killed while filming television series

<TEXT>
	   SQUAMISH, British Columbia (AP) _ A Canadian stuntman died after
being hit by flying debris from a controlled explosion on the set
of the television series ``The Crow: Stairway to Heaven.''
	   Marc Akerstream, 44, was watching the filming Friday when the
exploding debris cleared a large tree and came down to strike him
on the head, police said.
	   The 15-year veteran stuntman died later at Vancouver General
Hospital. He is from Vancouver.
	   The explosion was not part of any stunt, and Akerstream was
merely a bystander, said Lauro Chartrand, a friend of the victim.
	   Authorities, including the Royal Candadian Mounted Police, were
investigating the accident.
	   It was during filming of the original movie version of ``The
Crow'' that actor Brandon Lee _ son of martial arts legend Bruce
Lee _ was killed in an on-set shooting accident in 1993.
	   The syndicated TV series, being produced by Crescent
Entertainment, is set to premiere next month.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Sudanese rebel leaders vowed Monday to
continue their war against the Khartoum government while
maintaining the country's unity.
	   The announcement was made after rebel leaders wound up a
three-day meeting in Cairo which was convened at the behest of the
Egyptian government.
	   Egypt fears the civil war in southern and eastern Sudan could
lead to a division of the country and affect control of the Nile
River, the source of Egypt's water.
	   Farouk Abu Eissa, a spokesman for the National Democratic
Alliance, said a final communique of the meeting will be issued
Tuesday.
	   Rebel leader John Garang, former Prime Minister Sadiq el-Mahdi
and Mohammed Osman al-Mirgani _ who heads the National Democratic
Alliance agreed to ``expand the scope of the popular uprising in
all areas of Sudan,'' Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   They said they favored a united Sudan based on respect for
cultural differences, equality for all Sudanese and the separation
of church and state, MENA reported.
	   Garang _ whose Sudan People's Liberation Army has led the
15-year insurgency in southern Sudan _ left Cairo for Nairobi,
Kenya, before the National Democratic Alliance held the final
ceremonial session to close out its discussions.
	   Sudan complained that Egypt's organizing of the meeting was a
boost to the opposition. But President Hosni Mubarak said in an
interview published Monday that he met with the rebels to try to
keep the neighboring nation unified.
	   ``This meeting was held in the interest of our brothers in
Sudan,'' he told the weekly newspaper Mayo of Egypt's ruling
National Democratic Party.
	   The southern rebels took up arms in 1983 to demand more autonomy
for the Christian, animist south from the Muslim, Arab north. More
than 1.5 million people have died in the conflict and related
famines.

Chechnya prohibits private oil condensate extraction, trade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Citing the threat of an environmental disaster,
the president of Chechnya signed a decree Monday prohibiting
individuals and private businesses from the extraction and trade of
oil condensate, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Khozh-Akhmed Yarikhanov, an advisor to President Aslan
Maskhadov, said that only state organizations would be authorized
to deal in oil condensate.
	   Chechen authorities are concerned about environmental damage
from the oil condensate wells, which according to ITAR-Tass have
sprung up in virtually every yard in the capital Grozny. The
province's fuel and energy ministry and environment department
estimate that millions of tons of oil condensate are 10-15 meters
(32.8-49.2 feet) underground on Grozny's outskirts.
	   Some oil condensate has reportedly leaked into the water table
and a Chechen river, ITAR-Tass said.

Nicaraguans criticize granting of tourist visas to Cuban refugees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FILADELFO ALEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ A wave of suspicion and criticism has
risen against the government of President Arnold Aleman for
granting tourist visas to seven Cuban refugees, including four
baseball players, who landed in Nicaragua last week.
	   Critics question why a Cuban exile group in Miami knew of the
refugee's arrival well before Nicaraguan officials.
	   The daily El Nuevo Diaro, a mouthpiece for the previous
Sandinista administration, said Aleman's government participated in
``the illegal trafficking of immigrants'' with the goal of
provoking a break in ties with Cuba.
	   The seven Cubans landed Thursday in Puerto Cabezas, in the
extreme northeast of the country, where they said a Costa Rican
ship carried them after rescuing them at sea when their small boat
broke apart.
	   From Miami, the Cuban American National Foundation announced the
refugees landed in Nicaragua on Thursday, the 72nd birthday of
Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
	   But even by midday Friday, Nicaraguan authorities said they had
no knowledge of the reported arrival. Then shortly after noon, the
refugees appeared in Managua and received tourist visas from the
General Director of Migration and Foreign issues.
	   They were assisted in their negotiations by Ninoska Perez,
president of the Cuban-American Association of Miami, who arrived
in Nicaragua a few days earlier.
	   Perez said the group was welcomed in Nicaragua under a promise
Aleman made in June to give humanitarian refuge to nearly 100
Cubans who landed in the Bahamas.
	   Augusto Zamora, a Foreign Ministry official during the
Sandinista administration, criticized the welcome, saying Aleman
was bowing to interests of the U.S. Cuban exile community, which
supported his presidential campaign.
	   ``The tourist visa is for people who enter the country
legally,'' he said.
	   The Aleman administration is opening ``a sea and land bridge''
at the margin of official institutions for use by Cuban exiles to
take people out of Cuba, he said in Sunday's edition of El Nuevo
Diaro.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi met with
Tunisian President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali on Monday for talks on
boosting relations between the two countries, Libyan television
reported.
	   Ben Ali, on the first visit by a Tunisian leader to Libya in
five years, received a red-carpet welcome by Libyan officials
outside the ruins of an apartment building bombed during the 1986
U.S. air raids on Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
	   Gadhafi, who is recovering from hip surgery, did not attend the
welcoming reception, said the television broadcast, monitored by
the British Broadcasting Corporation.
	   Speaking to reporters, Ben Ali reaffirmed his country's
commitment to seeing U.N. sanctions on Libya lifted, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency said.
	   Ben Ali returned home later Monday, MENA said. It did not give
any details.
	   The United Nations imposed economic and political sanctions on
Libya in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to surrender two Libyans
wanted in connection with the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   The embargo, which bans air travel to the country and has frozen
Libyan assets abroad, has also punished Libya for supporting
international terrorism.
	   Ben Ali also said he came to check on Gadhafi's health. Gadhafi
underwent surgery last month after breaking his hip during
exercise.
	   Gadhafi told reporters that the trip comes as part of continued
contacts between the two neighboring countries, MENA said.
	   Tunisia, which borders Libya on the east, is frequently used as
a land crossing into Libya due to the current sanctions.

Security Council meets to consider Iraq response
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with envoy saying Iraq unwilling to move &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ After days of discussion in Baghdad, the
U.N. envoy to Iraq reported Monday that Iraq is still unwilling to
back down in its standoff with U.N. weapons inspectors, diplomats
said Monday.
	   The report from Prakash Shah was being delivered to the Security
Council by Rolf Knutsson, director of the U.N. office of political
affairs.
	   ``There doesn't seem to be any progress,'' said one Western
diplomat, familiar with Shah's message. ``They haven't been able to
come to any sort of resolution or agreement.''
	   Iraq's ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said as much in comments to
reporters, saying that Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to freeze cooperation
with weapons inspectors was unchanged.
	   ``We found nothing in Shah's initiative that would satisfy our
concerns,'' Hamdoon said.
	   Negotiations with Shah were continuing, but ``our concerns will
have to be met,'' he said.
	   Iraq has demanded an end to sanctions imposed after Baghdad
invaded Kuwait in 1990, touching off the Gulf War. Iraqi officials
claim they have complied with U.N. resolutions demanding that they
destroy their long-range missiles and chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons.
	   Iraq froze cooperation with U.N. inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Baghdad had
destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   After receiving the briefing from Knutsson, the council was
expected to consider Japanese-drafted letters that would encourage
U.N. weapons inspectors to try to carry out inspections in the face
of Iraq's new ban.
	   With the low-key response, the council was trying to force Iraq
to make the next major move after its Aug. 5 decision, diplomats
said.
	   If Baghdad blocks an inspection, council members could more
easily hold Baghdad in violation of U.N. resolutions and a February
agreement that gave them unconditional access to suspected weapons
sites. To date, the council has only said Iraq's Aug. 5 freeze on
inspections ``contravened'' the agreement, a semantic detail but
one which prevented council members from threatening tougher
action.
	   Despite the stalemate, Secretary-General Kofi Annan does not
plan to get personally involved as he did last February, when the
United States and Britain threatened to bomb Iraq if it didn't
allow inspectors access into certain presidential sites, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   Annan brokered an accord that allowed inspectors access but ``he
personally does not foresee any role for himself at this time,''
Eckhard said.
	   The difference this time is that there is no threat of war, he
said.
	   The Japanese-drafted letters were to be sent to Butler and the
head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed El
Baradei, who both reported last week that their work was being
undermined by Baghdad's decision.
	   Not only new inspections but ongoing monitoring of suspected
weapons sites was being affected, the inspectors told the council.
	   The council's letter would reaffirm the work of inspectors,
acknowledge that their mandate was being undermined and say that
Baghdad's decision was unacceptable, the diplomats said.

Israeli bank robbing legend to get early prison release

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli businessman turned bank robber whose
motorcycle getaways were legendary in Israel during the late 1980s
will be released early for good behavior, the prison authority said
Monday.
	   Roni Liebowitz, nicknamed the ``Bikerbank,'' became a popular
cult figure after claiming that robbing banks was the only way to
maintain a decent lifestyle in Israel. Liebowitz, whose trademark
was firing one shot in the air before taking off on his bike, stole
over 300,000 shekels (then about dlrs 175,500) in 22 heists.
	   In 1991, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison but a parole
committee this week found Liebowitz to be a model prisoner and
recommended an early release, prison authority spokeswoman Orit
Messer-Harel said. She said Liebowitz would be paroled Sept. 2,
after serving one-third of his sentence.

Mississippi confronts past in 32-year-old murder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with details of trial. CLARIFIES lede that
all five trials involved same slaying. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HATTIESBURG, Mississippi (AP) _ Mississippi confronted one of
the ugliest episodes from its segregationist past Monday, putting a
former Klansman on trial for the fifth time on charges of ordering
a 1966 firebombing that killed a black man.
	   Samuel H. Bowers Jr., a 73-year-old former imperial wizard of
the White Knights of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan, is charged
with murder and arson in the death of Vernon Dahmer, who
prosecutors say was killed for helping blacks register to vote.
	   ``It's time for justice to be done,'' District Attorney Lindsay
Carter said as he walked to the courthouse.
	   The southern state became a battleground in the 1960s, when U.S.
civil rights activists demanding equal rights in voting and
education came under attack by white supremacists.
	   Bowers was tried by three state juries and one federal jury in
the late 1960s, but each one deadlocked.
	   He eventually served six years in prison for one of the most
notorious crimes of the civil rights era: the 1964 slayings of
three civil rights workers _ Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner and
James Chaney depicted in the movie ``Mississippi Burning.''
	   In Mississippi's first latter-day attempt to convict a white man
for crimes against blacks during the 1960s, Byron De La Beckwith
was found guilty in 1994 in the 1963 assassination of NAACP leader
Medgar Evers.
	   Like the De La Beckwith trial, the Bowers case will dredge up
Mississippi's segregationist past, when blacks who dared to
challenge white control were sometimes killed with impunity.
	   ``Just the fact that the state is pushing these trials is very
good. It means a change has taken place in the official climate of
the state,'' said Charles Sallis, a college history professor who
co-wrote a Mississippi textbook on the civil rights struggles of
the 1960s.
	   Because of the publicity, about 400 prospective jurors, a larger
number than usual, were summoned for questioning.
	   Four Klansmen were convicted in Dahmer's murder, but Bowers went
free. For the killings of the three civil rights workers, Bowers
and six others were convicted on federal charges in 1970. He was
released in 1976.
	   Prosecutors have said Bowers and fellow Klansmen were upset
after Dahmer (pronounced DAY-mer) announced that blacks could pay
their poll tax at his grocery store. The tax, since outlawed by the
federal Voting Rights Act, was designed to discourage blacks from
voting.
	   The firebombing of Dahmer's home and store reportedly had been
planned for at least three months in advance, including a ``dry
run.''

Report: American author who wrote about South dead at 97
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ American writer Julien Green, famed for his
bestselling novels in French about the antebellum South, has died
at the age of 97, French state radio reported Monday.
	   Radio France Info said Green died last Thursday in Paris, and
was buried outside the country. It did not cite a source.
	   The Paris-born Green was the first foreigner to be elected to
the Academie Francaise _ the elite panel that serves as a watchdog
over the French language.
	   But in November 1996, he made headlines by announcing he was
relinquishing his seat, saying he felt ``exclusively American'' and
citing his advanced age, his difficulty in getting around and his
profound distaste for honors.
	   He had been a member since 1971.
	   Green was born in Paris in 1900, the son of an American
import-export dealer from Virginia who settled in France in 1895
with his Georgia-born wife.
	   He spoke English at home and was regaled by his mother with
stories of the old South, its lush plantations and easy living.
	   He received a French public school education and joined the
French army at 18. Toward the end of World War I, he drove
ambulances on the French and Italian fronts.
	   Green's first visit to the United States was at 20, when he
entered the University of Virginia. Though he only stayed two
years, his deep feelings about the South were to influence his
later writings.
	   Green was one of France's most prolific writers, producing 17
novels, four short stories, five plays, an autobiography, numerous
biographies and essays, and 15 volumes of his daily journal _ all
in French. He also wrote five works in English.
	   His 1949 ``Dixie,'' written in French, was an instant
best-seller.

<TEXT>
	   AUGHER, Northern Ireland (AP) _ One minute, they were shopping
on an ordinary Saturday afternoon. The next minute, three
generations of a family were gone.
	   Townspeople say it was family that mattered most to 30-year-old
Avril Monaghan, pregnant with twins, and it was family she died
with in the Omagh carbombing _ her 18-month-old daughter Maura and
her 65-year-old mother, Mary Grimes.
	   ``The family have strong faith,'' said the Rev. Lawrence Dawson,
the Catholic parish priest who will preside Tuesday over the
funerals of Avril and her daughter. ``It's the only way you can
cope with this kind of problem.''
	   Mrs. Monaghan lived in the rolling green hills above Augher with
her husband, Michael. He makes his living as a carpenter; she found
work as a secretary. But, mostly, she was a mother, raising a son
and three daughters, the oldest 6 years old.
	   A widely published picture shows Mrs. Monaghan grinning at her
groom on her wedding day, a crown of flowers resting on her dark
hair.
	   Dawson said Mrs. Monaghan, who attended Mass with her children
the last morning of her life, was a stalwart contributor to the
church, helping organize functions at the parish school and putting
together quizzes for the students.
	   It is almost impossible for the 700 souls of Augher and nearby
Clogher, where the family sometimes attended church, to accept the
triple blow the Monaghan and Grimes clans have suffered, he said.
	   That pain stretches the 20 miles (32 kms) north to Beragh, where
Mrs. Grimes _ who had 10 other children _ lived with her husband
Mick, a dairy farmer.
	   Workers from a Omagh curtain shop have visited the Grimes family
to assure them their loved ones, struck by the bomb just after they
left the store, did not suffer.
	   ``They were dead right away,'' said Stephen McKervey, the
manager of R.D. Kells.

Sinn Fein dissident's son arrested over Omagh atrocity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-NIreland-One Family
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in graf 14 with 32 County Sovereignty Committee
denying involvement in bombing &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police arrested the son of a
leading Sinn Fein critic Monday on suspicion he helped commit
Northern Ireland's worst-ever terrorist attack, a car bomb in a
small town that killed 28 people from all sides of society.
	   Police took Shane Mackey, 19, and four other people at dawn from
their homes near Omagh, scene of Saturday's blast, 70 miles (110
kms) east to Belfast. Under British anti-terrorist law they can be
interrogated for up to a week before being released or charged.
	   Dubbed the ``Real IRA,'' the defectors and their novice recruits
have been blamed for planting car bombs in several Northern Ireland
towns this year, but never before with such horribly lethal effect.
They oppose the IRA ceasefire, and the support of its political
ally, Sinn Fein, for the Northern Ireland peace accord.
	   At Stormont, the British government's headquarters in Northern
Ireland, police and military chiefs from both parts of Ireland
plotted how to rout Irish Republican Army dissidents.
	   Mo Mowlam, Britain's minister responsible for governing Northern
Ireland, and the Irish Republic's justice minister, John
O'Donoghue, also attended the four-hour security conference at
Stormont in east Belfast.
	   Afterward Mowlam announced increased army and police deployments
along the border between the two states, but said she wouldn't
reveal other details, ``because it would be stupid.''
	   When asked whether both governments were discussing whether to
change their laws so that Real IRA suspects could be convicted
based only on testimony from anti-terrorist detectives, she said:
``You're in the right ballpark.''
	   Convicting even high-profile militants of belonging to one of
Northern Ireland's many outlawed paramilitary groups has usually
been impossible to prove.
	   In Omagh, the young suspect's father, local councilman Francis
Mackey, emphasized that the attack was a ``terrible tragedy'' _ but
steadfastly refused to condemn the bombers.
	   He said his son had been arrested as part of a British
conspiracy ``to demonize me for being honest and open in expression
of my political opinions.''
	   Mackey, re-elected by the area's militant Catholics last year
while still a member of Sinn Fein, resigned after party leaders
formally accepted April's compromise Belfast agreement on how
Northern Ireland should be governed.
	   He now aligns himself with an anti-agreement group called the 32
County Sovereignty Committee led by Bernadette Sands-McKevitt, wife
of the martyred IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands _ and common-law
wife of the Real IRA's reputed commander.
	   Like his diehard colleagues, Mackey opposes the agreement's
acknowledgement that Northern Ireland's six counties should
continue to exist as a Protestant-majority state linked with
Britain so long as most citizens here want that.
	   He has previously said that the IRA cease-fire of July 1997 was
misguided, but refused to discuss this Monday.
	   Mackey ``categorically'' rejected comments by British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern and Northern
Ireland police chief Ronnie Flanagan indicating that the 32 County
Sovereignty Committee had links with the bombing.
	   ``No amount of words from me will in any way alleviate the
suffering of the bereaved and the injured,'' he said.
	   The full horror of the Omagh bombing was laid bare Monday as
police confirmed the identities of all but one of the dead, among
them two baby girls.

Tyson will have re-licensing hearing Sept. 15 in Nevada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson, who sought to bypass Nevada in a
bid to return to boxing, will have a hearing before the state's
athletic commission Sept. 15.
	   It was not known immediately whether Tyson would appear at the
hearing.
	   Tyson was banned by the Nevada Athletic Commission in July 1997
after biting Evander Holyfield's ears during their heavyweight
championship fight.
	   He was eligible to reapply for a license in Nevada July 9, but
bypassed the state and went through the licensing process in New
Jersey. Last Thursday, he surprisingly withdrew the application in
New Jersey and said he would seek licensing in Nevada.
	   Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada Athletic
Commission, expects Tyson to attend because commissioners will want
to question him.
	   Tyson adviser Shelley Finkel could not be reached immediately
for comment on the fighter's plans.
	   Dr. Elias Ghanem, chairman of the Nevada Athletic Commission,
said last Thursday a decision would come quickly.
	   ``We vote on it on the spot and we don't delay our decisions,''
Ghanem said.
	   Ghanem said Tyson would have to prove to the five-member Nevada
commission that he is fit to return to the sport.
	   Ratner said the Nevada hearing ``will be fair and impartial.''
	   The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J., citing unidentified sources,
reported Friday that two of New Jersey's three board members might
have opposed Tyson and the third member was not expected to vote.
	   Last month, New Jersey regulators listened as the former
champion asked for his license back _ but he also got angry and
cursed in front of them.
	   Finkel didn't give a reason for the switch, other than to say
there was concern over the perception that the boxer was trying to
get around the Nevada ban by applying in New Jersey. Finkel denied
he feared Tyson's application would be rejected.
	   ``I felt very positive,'' Finkel said, adding that he also was
confident about Tyson's chances in Nevada. ``We can always go back
to New Jersey if it's bad in Nevada.''
	   Nevada boxing regulators expected all along that Tyson would
reapply for his license in Nevada after a mandatory one-year wait.
	   Asking New Jersey for the license was seen as a calculated
gamble by Finkel.
	   Tyson's license was revoked and he was fined dlrs 3 million for
biting Holyfield's ears during the third round of their June 28,
1997, rematch for the heavyweight title.

Woman, son killed by pack of sled dogs in Canada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZACHARIAS ISLAND, Newfoundland (AP) _ A pack of sled dogs
attacked and killed a woman and her 10-year-old son as they picked
berries on an island off the Labrador coast, police said Monday.
	   ``It would rank with some of the worst incidents I've ever had
to deal with,'' said Constable Richard Langille of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police.
	   Langille said Betty Gauntlett and her son, Daniel Obed, were
picking berries Sunday when they were set upon by eight sled dogs.
	   The woman's common-law husband and an 8-year-old boy, whose
names were not released, escaped to their boat after fending off
the animals with rocks and sticks, he said.
	   ``They're big dogs,'' Langille said. ``They range anywhere from
60 to 80 pounds (28 to 36 kilos), maybe more, and when they get
into a frenzy like that in a pack, it wouldn't take very long at
all to disable someone.''
	   It is common practice for dog owners in northern Canada to
deposit their animals on islands during the summer when they are
not in use pulling sleds. The practice was adopted so the idle dogs
wouldn't create a noise problem in their owners' communities.
	   After Sunday's attack, police and area residents destroyed the
dogs. The carcasses were handed over to wildlife officials to be
tested for rabies.
	   Labrador is the mainland portion of the province of
Newfoundland. Zacharias Island is near the coastal town of
Hopedale, home to about 600 Inuit, formerly known as Eskimos.

Security Council meets to consider Iraq response

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Richardson comment, Shah expected back Thursday,
council president rejecting suggestions of tame response. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ After days of discussion in Baghdad, a
U.N. envoy reported Monday that Iraq is still unwilling to back
down in its standoff with U.N. weapons inspectors, diplomats said.
	   The report from Prakash Shah was delivered to the Security
Council by Rolf Knutsson, director of the U.N. office of political
affairs.
	   ``There doesn't seem to be any progress,'' said one Western
diplomat, familiar with Shah's message. ``They haven't been able to
come to any sort of resolution or agreement.''
	   Iraq's ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said as much in comments to
reporters, saying that Iraq's Aug. 5 decision to freeze cooperation
with weapons inspectors was unchanged.
	   ``We found nothing in Shah's initiative that would satisfy our
concerns,'' Hamdoon said.
	   Negotiations with Shah were continuing, but ``our concerns will
have to be met,'' he said.
	   Iraq has demanded an end to sanctions imposed after Baghdad
invaded Kuwait in 1990, touching off the Gulf War. Iraqi officials
claim they have complied with U.N. resolutions demanding that they
destroy their long-range missiles and chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons.
	   Iraq froze cooperation with U.N. inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Baghdad had
destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   After receiving the briefing from Knutsson, the council
considered Japanese-drafted letters that would encourage U.N.
weapons inspectors to try to carry out inspections in the face of
Iraq's new ban.
	   With the low-key response, the council was trying to force Iraq
to make the next major move after its Aug. 5 decision, diplomats
said.
	   If Baghdad blocks an inspection, council members could more
easily hold Baghdad in violation of U.N. resolutions and a February
agreement that gave them unconditional access to suspected weapons
sites. To date, the council has only said Iraq's Aug. 5 freeze on
inspections ``contravened'' the agreement, a semantic detail which
prevented council members from taking tougher action.
	   Shah was expected to return to New York on Thursday, and council
members were expected to get a personal briefing from him soon
thereafter.
	   ``What is happening right now is a record is being established,
a documentary record of Iraq's violations and its refusals to
comply,'' said U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson.
	   The Japanese-drafted letters were to be sent to Butler and the
head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed El
Baradei, who both reported last week that their work was being
undermined by Baghdad's decision.
	   The council's letter would encourage inspectors to try to go
about their work and say that Baghdad's decision was unacceptable,
the diplomats said.
	   The current council president, Danilo Turk of Slovenia, rejected
suggestions that the council's tame reaction pointed to a
reluctance to take action to force Iraqi compliance.
	   ``This is only the beginning of the situation,'' he said, adding
that it took months for the council to formulate a tough stance
during the last dispute over inspections.
	   Despite the stalemate, Secretary-General Kofi Annan does not
plan to get personally involved as he did last February, when the
United States and Britain threatened to bomb Iraq if it didn't
allow inspectors access into certain presidential sites, U.N.
spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   Because there is no threat of war, Annan does not foresee any
role for himself, Eckhard said.

American author who wrote about South dead at 97
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details, background; ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ American novelist Julien Green, who enriched the
French language with tales of the American South over a career that
spanned more than six decades, has died at the age of 97, French
media reported Monday.
	   Radio France Info and LCI television said Green died last
Thursday in Paris, and was buried in a private ceremony outside the
country. They cited no source. The U.S. Embassy in Paris said
Monday night it hadn't heard of Green's death.
	   The Paris-based Green became, in 1971, the first foreigner to be
elected to the Academie Francaise _ the elite panel that serves as
a watchdog over the French language.
	   But in November 1996, he made headlines by announcing he was
relinquishing his seat, saying he felt ``exclusively American'' and
citing his advanced age, his difficulty in getting around and his
profound distaste for honors.
	   Born in Paris to American parents, Green once described himself
as ``a southerner lost in Europe, regardless of what I do.''
	   Completely bilingual, he wrote mostly in French, with the
exception of ``Memories of Happy Days.'' Published in 1982, the
work recalled, in simple prose, the lost happiness of his
childhood.
	   Green was extremely prolific, producing more than a dozen
novels, four short stories, five plays, an autobiography, numerous
biographies and essays, and a multi-volume daily journal _ all in
French. He also wrote five works in English.
	   He was active until his late 80s, attending the Thursday
afternoon meetings of fellow Academie members and devoting several
hours a day to writing his autobiography. But in his final few
years he led a reclusive existence.
	   In March 1988, at age 87, he published ``L'Arc-En-Ciel (The
Rainbow),'' the 13th volume of his journal, dealing with the years
1981-84. At 81, he read the works of Franz Kafka for the first
time.
	   It was in 1987 that Green became a household name in France with
his bestseller, ``Pays Lointain (Faraway Country),'' a historical
novel about the American South that he began in 1934 but abandoned
because of the huge success of Margaret Mitchell's ``Gone With The
Wind.''
	   His best known works included ``Sud (South),'' a 1953 play about
the Civil War, and ``Moira'' (1950), a novel dramatizing the
struggle between man's sensuality and spirituality.
	   A devout Roman Catholic who converted from Protestantism, he
once said the greatest influence on his life and work was religious
philosopher Blaise Pascal and his tragic portrait ``Man Without
God.'' In ``Vers l'Invisible (Toward the Invisible),'' he described
the suffering of his early years when he oscillated between doubt
and faith.
	   Many of Green's novels were characterized by a kind of Gothic
atmosphere because of the subject matter: murder, suicide, sadism
and madness. ``Adrienne Mesurat,'' translated as ``The Closed
Garden'' (1927) and ``Midnight'' (1936), were dominated largely by
images of darkness and fear.
	   Julien Green was born in Paris in 1900, the son of an American
import-export dealer from Virginia who settled in France in 1895
with his Georgia-born wife.
	   He spoke English at home and was regaled by his mother with
stories of the old South, its lush plantations and easy living.
	   He received a French public school education and joined the
French army at 18. Toward the end of World War I, he drove
ambulances on the French and Italian fronts.
	   His first visit to the United States was at age 20, when he
entered the University of Virginia. Though he only stayed two
years, his deep feelings about the South were to influence his
later writings.
	   During World War II, he worked in the United States on radio
programs destined for the French public. He returned to France
after the war.
	   His 1949 ``Dixie,'' written in French, was an instant
bestseller.
	   In 1971 he became the first non-Frenchman to be elected to the
Academie Francaise, after receiving special dispensation from then-
President Georges Pompidou.
	   Details on survivors weren't immediately available.

	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Geoff Grant beat Slava Dosedel in
straight sets Monday in the only match to be completed before rain
halted much of the first day of play at the Pilot Pen International
tennis tournament.
	   The weather left several matches dangling, including that of Jan
Siemerink, the highest seed playing Monday. The ninth seed from the
Netherlands took a 5-4 lead over Ecuadoran Nicholas Lapentti into
the locker room.
	   Crowd favorite MaliVai Washington was leading 6-4, 1-3 when rain
stopped his match against Canadian Sebastien LaReau.
	   Grant, a wild card player from Watertown, Mass., won 6-2, 6-3
over Dosedel and faces Wimbledon finalist Goran Ivanisevic on
Tuesday.
	   ``It really couldn't be a better time to have that kind of
challenge,'' Grant said.
	   He has won twice on the Challenger Tour this year and said he is
especially pleased with his service returns, which will be needed
against the big-hitting Ivanisevic, who is seeded eighth.
	   Grant broke Dosedel's serve five times en route to the win.
	   Israeli Harel Levy was leading 7-5, 5-3 over Argentinian
Guillermo Canas and Frenchman Nicholas Escude was leading 6-4, 0-1
over German Rainer Schuttler when rain halted play.
	   Six day matches were postponed without players even taking the
court. Officials were waiting until 7:30 p.m. before deciding
whether to postpone the night's two matches.
	   Monday's day matches were pushed back to Tuesday.
	   Washington said he would rather have continued playing, but said
weather delays are just part of the game.
	   ``If you can deal with it over in London at Wimbledon ... you
can deal with it anywhere,'' he said.
	   Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras, the tournament's top seed, is
scheduled to play his first match on Wednesday. Defending champ
Yevgeny Kafelnikov also had a first-round bye and is expected to
play on Tuesday.

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ The advice came from past winners of
major championships and served Vijay Singh well.
	   A few hours before Singh took a share of the lead into the final
round of the PGA Championship, he met Nick Price and sought out the
help of someone who had won two PGA titles and the British Open.
	   ``What do you think I should do out there?'' Singh said.
	   ``Go out there and play your game,'' Price replied. ``You know
what to do. You've played it enough.''
	   With confidence on the greens and the ability to rise to the
occasion when his lead over Steve Stricker was slipping away, Singh
won his first major championship Sunday with a 2-under 68.
	   Not until he arrived safely at Sahalee Country Club's
treacherous 18th hole, with Stricker two strokes behind and the
Wanamaker Trophy in front of him, did Singh begin to appreciate how
all the years of relentless work on his game had finally paid off.
	   ``I can't believe that I've won this tournament,'' said the
35-year-old native of Fiji, who became the 10th winner in 11 years
to get his first major at the PGA.
	   ``Once I got the ball on the green, the feeling was ... `I'm the
winner. I'm the champion,' '' he said. ``Every year, you see
somebody walk up 18 and you wonder if that's ever going to be
you.''
	   But Singh prepared for this moment every time he finished a
round and headed to the range, where he would stay until twilight.
He thought about winning a major every time he checked into a hotel
room and moved furniture to clear room for more practice.
	   And if he ever wondered whether that was the right way to
prepare for winning a major, he found the affirmation a few years
ago when he met Tom Watson on the driving range _ where else? _ at
the Bay Hill Invitational.
	   ``I said, `How much did you practice when you were playing
well?' '' Singh said. ``He said, `I'd be out there every single
day.' That's a good thing to hear from a player like Tom Watson.
	   ``It makes you wonder. One cannot practice enough. The more you
practice, the better you get.''
	   Practice didn't prepare Singh for the pressure of what
essentially turned into match play for a major championship. But he
could always rely on the swing, tested from long hours of pounding
balls on the range.
	   That was never more true than at the 14th hole, where Singh's
drive wound up deep in the trees on the left.
	   Stricker, scrambling well while in contention for the first time
in a major, had closed to within one stroke and was finding his
groove off the tee. Singh had 110 yards (100 meters) to the front
of the green, about half that distance shrouded by trees.
	   The ball screamed out of the woods and veered sharply to the
left, bouncing onto the green to set up a two-putt from about 40
feet (12 meters).
	   ``I just hooded my wedge and just hooked the hell out of it,''
Singh said. ``It wasn't as difficult as it looked, although I was
in the trees. I've played that so many times before, but I guess
the situation was different.''
	   It culminated a stretch of four holes that turned the PGA in
Singh's favor. Four holes, four bad shots, three nice recoveries.
	   His 3-wood through the goal-post trees guarding the par-5 11th
green hit the right upright and luckily bounced through, setting up
a two-putt birdie. He bogeyed the 12th after hitting into a fairway
bunker, saved par at the par-3 13th from a bunker, and walked off
with par at the 14th.
	   When Stricker hit to 3 feet (0.9 meters) at No. 15, Singh
answered with a wedge to 6 feet for a birdie that kept him one
stroke ahead.
	   When Singh holed an 18-foot (5 1/2 meter) putt at the par-3 17th
to save par out of the bunker, Stricker couldn't make the same putt
from about 15 feet.
	   ``I was expecting him to make his,'' Singh said. ``That was a
sigh of a relief.''
	   It was a relief because Singh had a two-stroke lead with one
hole to play _ the par-4 18th, which was played 449 times during
the week but gave up only 18 birdies.
	   ``I've practiced so hard for this,'' Singh said. ``It's a dream
come true. What I did was unbelievable.''
	   But considering the amount of work he has put into his game, it
all made sense.
	   ``It was great,'' he said. ``I hope I can do it again.''

Governor calls referendum on Puerto Rican statehood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS HAWLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Ignoring criticism from allies and
opponents, Gov. Pedro Rossello on Monday authorized a referendum on
Puerto Rico's ties to the United States, telling islanders it was
time to choose between statehood or independence.
	   The bill signed by Rossello sets a Dec. 13 plebiscite that the
governor hopes will spur the U.S. Congress to resolve a wrangle
over the Caribbean island's status that began when U.S. troops
wrested it from the Spanish in 1898.
	   ``I trust that when this process is finished, we will have
managed to eradicate from our daily lives a 100-year debate that
weighs us down,'' Rossello said in a TV address.
	   Rossello wants Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory defined since 1952
as a ``commonwealth,'' to become the 51st state.
	   Rossello is expected to lobby Republicans for a change in Puerto
Rico's status during a meeting here this month of the Southern
Governors Association, over which he presides. Rossello is also
president of the Democratic Governors Association.
	   The Popular Democratic Party, which favors retaining the
commonwealth arrangement, vowed to challenge the law in court.
	   The party objects to the ballot's definition of commonwealth as
a territory under the control of Congress _ suggesting the 3.8
million Puerto Ricans' cherished U.S. citizenship can be revoked.
	   In a reflection of how charged the status debate has become, the
ballot will refer to statehood, independence and commonwealth by
numbers because lawmakers felt the words were too loaded.
	   ``What we have today is a bill that used to be bad, and that
(legislators) turned into grotesque,'' said Puerto Rican Sen.
Eudaldo Baez Galib, a commonwealth advocate, referring to the
results of a two-week dispute over wording among legislators here.
	   The planned vote has even inspired doubts among Rossello's
allies _ including Carlos Romero Barcelo, Puerto Rico's
pro-statehood delegate in Congress who has spent more than two
years trying to convince U.S. lawmakers to authorize such a vote on
the island.
	   His bill, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a
single vote in March, appears stalled in the U.S. Senate.
	   On Friday, Romero said the ballot in Rossello's plebiscite
``tends to deceive the people'' by offering them a second
independence option under a vaguely defined ``free association''
treaty with the United States.
	   On the ballot, voters will be able to choose between statehood,
the current commonwealth status, independence, independence with
the free association treaty, or ``none of the above.''
	   The ballot proposed by the Congressional bill offered only the
first three options.
	   Rossello said Monday that Puerto Ricans should choose ``one way
or the other'' _ between being independent like Cuba, which was
also ruled by Spain until 1898, or joining the union like Hawaii,
which came under U.S. control that year too.
	   Apparently referring to the House of Representatives vote and
supportive statements by President Clinton, Rossello insisted that
for the first time ``the U.S. government has clearly expressed its
commitment to listen to our demands.''

Tyson will have re-licensing hearing Sept. 9 in Nevada
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CHANGES hearing date to Sept. 9th &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson, who sought to bypass Nevada in a
bid to return to boxing, will have a hearing before the state's
athletic commission Sept. 9.
	   It was not known immediately whether Tyson would appear at the
hearing.
	   Tyson was banned by the Nevada Athletic Commission in July 1997
after biting Evander Holyfield's ears during their heavyweight
championship fight.
	   He was eligible to reapply for a license in Nevada July 9, but
bypassed the state and went through the licensing process in New
Jersey. Last Thursday, he surprisingly withdrew the application in
New Jersey and said he would seek licensing in Nevada.
	   Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada Athletic
Commission, expects Tyson to attend because commissioners will want
to question him.
	   Tyson adviser Shelley Finkel could not be reached immediately
for comment on the fighter's plans.
	   Dr. Elias Ghanem, chairman of the Nevada Athletic Commission,
said last Thursday a decision would come quickly.
	   ``We vote on it on the spot and we don't delay our decisions,''
Ghanem said.
	   Ghanem said Tyson would have to prove to the five-member Nevada
commission that he is fit to return to the sport.
	   Ratner said the Nevada hearing ``will be fair and impartial.''
	   The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J., citing unidentified sources,
reported Friday that two of New Jersey's three board members might
have opposed Tyson and the third member was not expected to vote.
	   Last month, New Jersey regulators listened as the former
champion asked for his license back _ but he also got angry and
cursed in front of them.
	   Finkel didn't give a reason for the switch, other than to say
there was concern over the perception that the boxer was trying to
get around the Nevada ban by applying in New Jersey. Finkel denied
he feared Tyson's application would be rejected.
	   ``I felt very positive,'' Finkel said, adding that he also was
confident about Tyson's chances in Nevada. ``We can always go back
to New Jersey if it's bad in Nevada.''
	   Nevada boxing regulators expected all along that Tyson would
reapply for his license in Nevada after a mandatory one-year wait.
	   Asking New Jersey for the license was seen as a calculated
gamble by Finkel.
	   Tyson's license was revoked and he was fined dlrs 3 million for
biting Holyfield's ears during the third round of their June 28,
1997, rematch for the heavyweight title.

UN chief condemns NIreland bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
Monday condemned the Northern Ireland bombing and the ``men of
violence'' who carried it out.
	   ``The secretary-general knows how deeply both communities in
Northern Ireland long to live free of the shadow of violence,''
said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard.
	   ``He shares the conviction of the great majority of the people
of Ireland, north and south, that change can only come about by
peaceful means.''
	   Annan condemns ``this wonton and indiscriminate act of
terrorism, and the men of violence who perpetrated it,'' he said.
	   Northern Ireland's worst-ever terrorist attack, a car bomb
Saturday in the small town of Omagh, killed 28 people.

Security Council meets to consider Iraq response
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with draft of letter, voicing support for UN mandates;
TRIMS; minor edits. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ After days of discussion in Baghdad, a
U.N. envoy reported Monday that Iraq is still unwilling to back
down in its standoff with U.N. weapons inspectors, diplomats said.
	   The report from Prakash Shah was delivered by Rolf Knutsson,
director of the U.N. office of political affairs, to the Security
Council, where diplomats worked on a response to the impasse.
	   ``There doesn't seem to be any progress,'' said one Western
diplomat, familiar with Shah's message. ``They haven't been able to
come to any sort of resolution or agreement.''
	   Iraq froze cooperation with U.N. inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Baghdad had
destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq's ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said that Iraq's Aug. 5
decision to freeze cooperation with weapons inspectors was
unchanged.
	   ``We found nothing in Shah's initiative that would satisfy our
concerns,'' Hamdoon said.
	   Negotiations with Shah were continuing, but ``our concerns will
have to be met,'' he said.
	   Iraq has demanded an end to sanctions imposed after Baghdad
invaded Kuwait in 1990, touching off the Gulf War. Iraqi officials
claim they have complied with U.N. resolutions demanding that they
destroy their long-range missiles and chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons.
	   After receiving the briefing from Knutsson, the council
considered Japanese-drafted letters that diplomats said would
encourage U.N. weapons inspectors to try to carry out inspections
in the face of Iraq's new ban.
	   The letters were to be sent to Butler, the head of the U.N.
Special Commission, and the head of the International Atomic Energy
Agency, Mohammed El Baradei, who both reported last week that their
work was being undermined by Baghdad's decision.
	   According to a draft of the letter, the council called Iraq's
actions ``totally unacceptable,'' and said its members ``reiterate
their full support of the IAEA and UNSCOM in the full
implementation of their mandates.''
	   ``Iraq is obliged under the relevant Security Council
resolutions to provide the IAEA/UNSCOM with the cooperation
necessary for them to undertake their activities,'' it said.
	   With the low-key response, the council was trying to force Iraq
to make the next major move after its Aug. 5 decision, diplomats
said.
	   If Baghdad blocks an inspection, council members could more
easily hold Baghdad in violation of U.N. resolutions and a February
agreement that gave them unconditional access to suspected weapons
sites. To date, the council has only said Iraq's Aug. 5 freeze on
inspections ``contravened'' the agreement, a semantic detail which
prevented council members from taking tougher action.
	   Shah was expected to return Thursday to New York, and council
members were expected to get a personal briefing from him soon
thereafter. On Monday, Aziz briefed President Saddam Hussein and
the Iraqi cabinet on the outcome of the discussions.
	   ``What is happening right now is a record is being established,
a documentary record of Iraq's violations and its refusals to
comply,'' said U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson.
	   The current council president, Danilo Turk of Slovenia, rejected
suggestions that the council's tame reaction pointed to a
reluctance to take action to force Iraqi compliance.
	   ``This is only the beginning of the situation,'' he said, adding
that it took months for the council to formulate a tough stance
during the last dispute over inspections.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police arrested the son of a
leading Sinn Fein critic Monday on suspicion he helped commit
Northern Ireland's worst-ever terrorist attack, a car bomb in a
small town that killed 28 people from all walks of life.
	   Police took Shane Mackey, 19, and four other people at dawn from
their homes near Omagh, scene of Saturday's blast, 70 miles (110
kms) east to Belfast. Under British anti-terrorist law they can be
interrogated for up to a week before being released or charged.
	   Dubbed the ``Real IRA,'' the defectors and their novice recruits
have been blamed for planting car bombs in several Northern Ireland
towns this year in defiance of the Irish Republican Army's July
1997 truce.
	   At Stormont, the British government's headquarters in Northern
Ireland, police and military chiefs from both parts of Ireland
plotted how to rout the diehards before they strike again.
	   Mo Mowlam, Britain's minister responsible for governing Northern
Ireland, and the Irish Republic's justice minister, John
O'Donoghue, also attended the four-hour security conference at
Stormont in east Belfast.
	   Afterward Mowlam announced increased army and police deployments
along the border between the two states, but declined to reveal
other details, saying to do so ``would be stupid.''
	   When asked whether both governments were discussing whether to
change their laws so that Real IRA suspects could be convicted
based only on testimony from anti-terrorist detectives, she said:
``You're in the right ballpark.''
	   Convicting even high-profile militants of belonging to one of
Northern Ireland's many outlawed paramilitary groups has often
proved impossible.
	   In Omagh, the young suspect's father, local councilman Francis
Mackey, emphasized that the attack was a ``terrible tragedy'' _ but
steadfastly refused to condemn the bombers.
	   He said his son had been arrested as part of a British
conspiracy ``to demonize me for being honest and open in expression
of my political opinions.''
	   Mackey, re-elected by the area's militant Catholics last year
while still a member of Sinn Fein, resigned after party leaders
formally accepted April's compromise Belfast agreement on how
Northern Ireland should be governed.
	   He now aligns himself with an anti-agreement group called the 32
County Sovereignty Committee. The legal group is led by Bernadette
Sands-McKevitt, sister of the martyred IRA hunger striker Bobby
Sands _ and common-law wife of the reputed commander of the
outlawed Real IRA.
	   Like his new colleagues, Mackey opposes the agreement's
acknowledgement that Northern Ireland should continue to exist as a
Protestant-majority state linked with Britain so long as most
citizens here want that.
	   He has previously said that the IRA cease-fire was misguided,
but refused to discuss this Monday.
	   ``No amount of words from me will in any way alleviate the
suffering of the bereaved and the injured,'' he said.
	   The full horror of the Omagh bombing was laid bare Monday as
police finally confirmed the identities of all 28 dead, among them
two baby girls.
	   Forensics experts at Omagh's makeshift morgue inside a British
army base concluded work on many bodies late Monday. The first of
several hearses arrived to carry caskets back to grief-striken
homes for traditional Irish wakes.
	   Among the first to depart was the tiny white coffin bearing the
youngest victim, 18-month-old Maura Monaghan, alongside the
full-sized wood casket of her mother, Avril. They will be buried
Tuesday morning, while the baby's 65-year-old grandmother, also
slain in the bombing, will be buried Wednesday.
	   Of 220 wounded, 108 remained in hospitals across Northern
Ireland, 11 in critical condition. Many others were crippled or
blinded.
	   Unlike most attacks in Northern Ireland, the dead came from both
sides of the religious divide and from every political allegience.
They included Sinn Fein supporters as well as moderate Catholics, a
Protestant activist of the Ulster Unionist Party, and a niece of
Omagh's most hard-line Protestant politician.
	   ``This is not a crime against any particular section of our
people, Protestant or Roman Catholic,'' said the Democratic

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police arrested the son of a
leading Sinn Fein critic Monday on suspicion he helped commit
Northern Ireland's worst-ever terrorist attack, a car bomb in a
small town that killed 28 people from all walks of life.
	   Police took Shane Mackey, 19, and four other people at dawn from
their homes near Omagh, scene of Saturday's blast, 70 miles (110
kms) east to Belfast. Under British anti-terrorist law they can be
interrogated for up to a week before being released or charged.
	   Dubbed the ``Real IRA,'' the defectors and their novice recruits
have been blamed for planting car bombs in several Northern Ireland
towns this year in defiance of the Irish Republican Army's July
1997 truce.
	   At Stormont, the British government's headquarters in Northern
Ireland, police and military chiefs from both parts of Ireland
plotted how to rout the diehards before they strike again.
	   Mo Mowlam, Britain's minister responsible for governing Northern
Ireland, and the Irish Republic's justice minister, John
O'Donoghue, also attended the four-hour security conference at
Stormont in east Belfast.
	   Afterward Mowlam announced increased army and police deployments
along the border between the two states, but declined to reveal
other details, saying to do so ``would be stupid.''
	   When asked whether both governments were discussing whether to
change their laws so that Real IRA suspects could be convicted
based only on testimony from anti-terrorist detectives, she said:
``You're in the right ballpark.''
	   Convicting even high-profile militants of belonging to one of
Northern Ireland's many outlawed paramilitary groups has often
proved impossible.
	   In Omagh, the young suspect's father, local councilman Francis
Mackey, emphasized that the attack was a ``terrible tragedy'' _ but
steadfastly refused to condemn the bombers.
	   He said his son had been arrested as part of a British
conspiracy ``to demonize me for being honest and open in expression
of my political opinions.''
	   Mackey, re-elected by the area's militant Catholics last year
while still a member of Sinn Fein, resigned after party leaders
formally accepted April's compromise Belfast agreement on how
Northern Ireland should be governed.
	   He now aligns himself with an anti-agreement group called the 32
County Sovereignty Committee. The legal group is led by Bernadette
Sands-McKevitt, sister of the martyred IRA hunger striker Bobby
Sands _ and common-law wife of the reputed commander of the
outlawed Real IRA.
	   Like his new colleagues, Mackey opposes the agreement's
acknowledgement that Northern Ireland should continue to exist as a
Protestant-majority state linked with Britain so long as most
citizens here want that.
	   He has previously said that the IRA cease-fire was misguided,
but refused to discuss this Monday.
	   ``No amount of words from me will in any way alleviate the
suffering of the bereaved and the injured,'' he said.
	   The full horror of the Omagh bombing was laid bare Monday as
police finally confirmed the identities of all 28 dead, among them
two baby girls.
	   Forensics experts at Omagh's makeshift morgue inside a British
army base concluded work on many bodies late Monday. The first of
several hearses arrived to carry caskets back to grief-striken
homes for traditional Irish wakes.
	   Among the first to depart was the tiny white coffin bearing the
youngest victim, 18-month-old Maura Monaghan, alongside the
full-sized wood casket of her mother, Avril. They will be buried
Tuesday morning, while the baby's 65-year-old grandmother, also
slain in the bombing, will be buried Wednesday.
	   Of 220 wounded, 108 remained in hospitals across Northern
Ireland, 11 in critical condition. Many others were crippled or
blinded.
	   Unlike most attacks in Northern Ireland, the dead came from both
sides of the religious divide and from every political allegience.
They included Sinn Fein supporters as well as moderate Catholics, a
Protestant activist of the Ulster Unionist Party, and a niece of
Omagh's most hard-line Protestant politician.
	   ``This is not a crime against any particular section of our
people, Protestant or Roman Catholic,'' said the Democratic
Unionist politician, Oliver Gibson, whose niece Esther perished
with the rest.
	   ``This was a bid to destroy an entire community,'' he said,
noting that he knew most victims by first name.
	   For the first time in the three-decade course of Northern
Ireland's conflict, foreign tourists were among the dead _ a
teacher and 12-year-old student from Spain.
	   Spain's deputy prime minister, Francisco Alvarez Cascos, toured
Omagh with relatives of the dead and 11 wounded Madrid students,
including two girls hospitalized in Belfast's Royal Victoria
Hospital with critical head injuries.
	   ``There is good and evil everywhere,'' said Helguero Peuch,
mother of one of the most seriously injured Spanish girls,
9-year-old Beatrez.

Tournament concludes six months after start
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Mickelson winning &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PEBBLE BEACH, California (AP) _ It took Phil Mickelson just two
days to rebound from a major disappointment and win a tournament
that took six months to complete.
	   Mickelson, forgetting a lost weekend at the PGA Championship,
had six birdies in the final round Monday for a one-shot victory
over Tom Pernice in the AT and T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, a
tournament that began in January.
	   Mickelson was just four strokes back heading into the third
round of the PGA Championship, but posted a 9-over 79 on Saturday
to fall out of the title chase.
	   He came back with a 67 on Sunday at Sahalee Country Club and
continued that strong play with a 5-under 67 on Monday at Pebble
Beach _ including a birdie on the final hole.
	   ``I had to start seeing better shots, and I did that on
Sunday,'' said Mickelson, who celebrated by hugging his grandmother
_ who walked all 18 holes with him Monday. ``I carried that with me
today.''
	   The AT and T victory, his first since January, earned Mickelson
dlrs 450,000 as well as a dlrs 100,000 bonus for having the highest
overall earnings in eight West Coast events this year. He also won
the Mercedes Championship in Carlsbad, California that began the
season.
	   Mickelson's three-round total of 14-under 202 tied for the
lowest 54-hole score in AT and T tournament history. This was the
14th time the tournament had been shortened to 54 holes.
	   Pernice, playing the Poppy Hills course, was 13 under until he
three-putted No. 17 for a bogey. Still, he had a 15-foot
(4.5-meter) eagle putt on the final hole with a chance to catch
Mickelson, and missed it.
	   Jim Furyk shot a 68 on Pebble Beach to finish two shots behind
Mickelson. J.P. Hayes also finished at 12-under on Poppy Hills.
	   Pernice said finishing the tournament six months after it began
was the only fair thing to do. Two years ago, the entire tournament
had to be canceled because of lousy weather.
	   ``I think the tour did the right thing,'' he said. ``They tried
to do whatever they could to satisfy the people of Pebble Beach.
This is one of our special events.''
	   When the AT and T tournament began in late January, waves from
the Pacific Ocean were crashing onto the 18th fairway. Sheet-like
rain turned sandtraps into water hazards and gusty winds snapped
treetops.
	   On Monday, months after the demise of El Nino, the tourney
resumed on an overcast, dry morning. The ocean was placid and there
was a cool breeze.
	   Of the 168 pros who started the tournament, 133 returned for the
final round. Among those not returning were Tiger Woods, who
finished the second round 14 strokes off the lead, and Jack
Nicklaus. Also dropping out was Vijay Singh, who won the PGA
Championship on Sunday.
	   The AT and T tournament chartered a plane to take players from
Seattle to Monterey on Sunday night. Those continuing to the next
tour stop, the International near Denver, got another chartered
flight Monday night.
	   PGA Tour officials said it was the first time a portion of a
tournament has been played, then completed months later.
	   The long interruption forced Pebble Beach officials, not used to
hosting a major tournament during the summer, to make some
last-minute maneuvers on the course that played host to a vintage
car display on Sunday.
	   Crowds were thin and there were few scoreboards along the
course, leaving Mickelson and his peers confused about the leaders.
	   As he began the 18th hole, Mickelson thought he needed a birdie
or an eagle just to tie Pernice. As it turned out, they each had
birdies and Mickelson won by a stroke.
	   ``I wanted to know where I stood,'' Mickelson said, ``and it was
frustrating not knowing.''

Bryan wins first pro match in rain-delayed RCA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ NCAA champion Bob Bryan won his first pro
match in Monday's rain-delayed RCA Championships, then set his
sights on top-ranked and top-seeded Marcelo Rios, his second-round
opponent.
	   Bryan ousted Steve Campbell 6-1, 0-6, 6-1 in an all-American
match that featured dramatic swings and ended shortly before a rain
shower swept across the Indianapolis Tennis Center.
	   Bryan said if he had to play the top seed, he prefers it be Rios
than Pete Sampras, who is competing this week in the Pilot Pen
International in New Haven, Connecticut.
	   ``Of all the top players, that's the one I would want to play,''
Bryan said of Rios. ``I wouldn't want to go play Sampras right now
and have him just whack serves all day at me.
	   ``I think I can play with him, and I think I'm in the point
every time,'' he said of Rios. ``He's not just going to serve me
off the court. Hopefully, I can get it rolling out there with him.
	   ``He (Rios) is a tough player; one of the world's best. It's
going to be a good opportunity, a good experience. I'm looking
forward to it.''
	   In other matches completed before rain halted play, Hicham Arazi
of Monaco stopped South African Marcos Ondruska 7-6 (7-4), 6-2;
Arnaud Clement of France ousted Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands
6-4, 6-4; Ramon Delgado of Paraguay defeated Jerome Golmard of
France 6-3, 6-2; and Brian MacPhie stopped Spain's Jordi Burillo
6-4, 6-3.

Jeyaseelan rains on Pratt's parade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTREAL (AP) _ Sonya Jeyaseelan gave Canadian tennis fans
something to cheer about Monday.
	   The Oakville, Ontario, native, a wild-card entrant ranked 125th
in the world, benefited from a lengthy rain delay to knock off
Nicole Pratt of Australia 7-5, 6-3 and advanced to the second round
of the du Maurier Open.
	   ``I started off pretty nervous and I tried to overhit the ball,
but when we had the rain delay, I talked to my coach and he told me
to just calm down and relax,'' the 22-year-old Jeyaseelan said. ``I
came out feeling much more comfortable.''
	   The match was delayed by rain for more than an hour with the
score tied 4-4 in the first set. When play finally resumed,
Jeyaseelan dictated tempo and covered the court well, reaching and
often punishing Pratt's short balls in a grueling baseline duel.
	   In other matches, 12th-seeded Dominique Van Roost of Belgium
eliminated Canada's Jana Nejedly 6-4, 6-2 and No. 16 Ai Sugiyama of
Japan ousted Nathalie Dechy of France 7-6, 7-5 (7-2).

Commission to investigate Guyana's telephone monopoly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The Guyanese government said Monday it
will begin reviewing its monopoly agreement with the country's
telephone company.
	   The Public Utilities Commission will begin hearings Aug. 24 to
probe the contract with the Guyana Telephone Company, which is
controlled by U.S. Virgin Islands-based Atlantic Tele Network.
	   The government of this South American country has a 20 percent
stake in the utility.
	   Atlantic Tele Network and government regulators have had an
uneasy relationship following the 1991 privatization agreement that
gave the company a 20-year monopoly.
	   Politicians were outraged when the company began opening
international sex chat lines, but Atlantic Tele Network claimed the
lines helped subsidize cheap telephone service.
	   The government allowed the company to raise its rates by 60
percent in January, but later cut the increase to 30 percent and
began an investigation into the company's complaints that income
from the chat lines had dropped.
	   Guyana Telephone has about 60,000 subscribers.

Corinthians seeks to extend winning streak against Racing in
</HEADLINE>
Mercosul Cup

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Corinthians faces Argentina's Racing on
Tuesday in a game that will give the winner first place in Group C
of the Mercosul Cup.
	   Four teams are deadlocked with one point after two ties the
opening round. Corinthians tied Paraguay's Olimpia 2-2 and Racing
drew 1-1 with Penarol of Uruguay.
	   Since club play resumed after the World Cup, Corinthians has
been on a roll. The team is undefeated in the Brazilian
first-division championship and leads the standings with 16 points.
Forward Marcelinho is the scoring leader with eight goals.
	   Coach Wanderley Luxemburgo, named this month to replace Mario
Zagallo at the helm of the Brazilian national team, will likely be
without the services of injured fullback Cris. Batata is expected
to start in his place.
	   The game starts at 9:40 p.m. (0040 GMT Wednesday) at Morumbi
stadium.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Fossett moved to New Zealand ship, expected
arrival in Townsville &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos SYD101-103
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Adventurer Steve Fossett's dream of
flying his balloon nonstop around the world turned into a nightmare
as lightning storms and hail knocked him out of the sky and sent
him crashing into the South Pacific.
	   The schooner Atlanta picked up the U.S. millionaire-adventurer
Monday night from the Coral Sea about 500 miles (800 kilometers)
off Australia's east coast, New Zealand Defense Force spokesman
Bill Morley said.
	   Fossett was safe aboard the 60-foot (18 meter) Atlanta and was
taken aboard the New Zealand navy tanker HMNZS Endeavour on Tuesday
morning, Morley said.
	   Nearby rescue ships and planes had stood guard as Fossett bobbed
in a life raft dropped Monday morning by a French air-sea rescue
plane sent from Noumea, New Caledonia.
	   Fossett was in regular radio contact with a Royal Australian Air
Force Hercules C-130, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority
said.
	   ``The rescue was very straight-forward. Mr. Fossett is in good
health and given that he is out of danger, they might proceed to
Townsville (Australia) tonight,'' Authority spokesman Brian Hill
said.
	   He is expected to be at Townsville in about 2-1/2 days.
	   After drifting swiftly around two-thirds of the world nonstop,
Fossett's balloon Solo Spirit was ripped by a violent lightning
storm.
	   ``He said he was caught in a giant thunderstorm with hail and
lightning which actually ruptured his balloon,'' said Darren Curtis
from Australia's TV 7 Network, aboard the Australian Hercules
C-130.
	   ``He says when he hit the ocean his balloon capsule caught fire
and he had to evacuate into a tiny life raft,'' Curtis said, after
talking to Fossett via the plane's radio.
	   Fossett said it was a wild ride from his initial altitude of
29,000 feet to the water.
	   ``Amazing,'' he said in an interview with Curtis. ``Tremendous
sheets of hail just flooding me and my greatest descent rate on
altimeter was 25,000 feet a minute.''
	   At Solo Spirit balloon mission control in St. Louis, Missouri,
media control spokesman Alan Blount said the rate of descent
described by Fossett would amount to dropping at a rate of almost
45 miles (72 kilometers) per hour.
	   ``He is fortunate. There are not too many of us around that have
been in a storm like that,'' said Blount.
	   Mission Control had alerted Australian authorities at 1 a.m.
Monday (1500 GMT Sunday) that Fossett's emergency beacon had been
activated in the Coral Sea.
	   But his splashdown in the wreckage of the Solo Spirit among
uncharted coral reefs near the Chesterfield Islands meant rescue
ships had to navigate cautiously after sunset.
	   The first boat to arrive was the Australian yacht Atlanta, whose
skipper Laurie Piper negotiated the maze of reefs in darkness.
	   Solo Spirit Mission Control director Alan Blount said a severe
thunderstorm system that showered 10,000 lightning strikes over the
Coral Sea most likely caused the crash landing.
	   Fossett had dreaded the possibility of ditching at sea.
	   ``An ocean landing would be very scary,'' he said before setting
off from Argentina 10 days ago in his bid to be the first to fly a
balloon around the world nonstop.
	   About five hours before Fossett's warning locator sounded,
meteorologist Bob Rice had cautioned the balloonist he was
approaching strong thunderstorms _ and that they would be nearly
impossible to avoid.
	   Fossett had a long stretch of the Pacific Ocean between
Australia and Argentina to go and had at least another five days of
travel before he was expected to reach South America, where he left
from on Aug. 7.
	   He had traveled 15,200 miles (24,460 km) when he crashed.
	   The 54-year-old Fossett, from Chicago, was making his fourth
attempt to fly around the world. He has also run marathons, climbed
mountains and raced in the Iditarod dog sled race in Alaska.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ By changing his story, President Bill Clinton
imprinted his presidency with a mark of deception and betrayal of
trust.
	   Almost certainly, his confession will erode his credibility.
	   In his unprecedented testimony, advisers said the president
admitted to an inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky _ an
admission that puts him in uncharted territory. Presidents don't
tell the nation that they lied. They say mistakes were made and
pass the blame. Clinton, at the risk of political and legal peril,
decided to change his story even though he had maintained a stance
of innocence for seven months.
	   Most Americans already felt he was lying. It was a wrenching
ordeal that they simply want to forget. It remains to be seen
whether they will forgive.
	   The about-face could weaken his hand with Congress, too. But
political analysts expect he will survive.
	   ``I think he cannot emerge from this with anything but injury,''
said Boston University historian Robert Dallek. ``We had a lame
duck president. We'll have an even lamer duck presidency. The
penalty he pays is embarrassment, diminished stature, people don't
trust him. They don't find him in many ways worthy of the office.
But times are good. We're stuck with him.''
	   Other presidential scholars are uncertain about the outcome.
	   ``I honestly don't have any confidence in forecasting what the
public's attitude will be two months from now,'' said Thomas Mann,
director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution think
tank. ``I could see him getting beyond it because of his
extraordinary political skills. And I could see the public souring
and supporters deserting him if they think he's been too clever by
half.
	   ``We just haven't had anything like this before. Everything is
new and most of it for the worst,'' Mann said.
	   Pollster Andrew Kohut of the Pew Research Center recalled that
public opinion defied conventional wisdom in January when the
scandal broke, as Clinton's approval rating rose instead of
falling.
	   ``Polls overwhelmingly show the public would accept an
apology,'' Kohut said. ``But I don't think anyone can say that
peoples' intentions are absolutely certain to be matched by their
reactions if the president says he told them a lie.''
	   Republicans say Clinton's admission will make it harder for him
to challenge them on tax cuts and Social Security or try to blame
them for a possible government shutdown this fall. His words
``won't have the sting they previously had,'' predicted Republican
strategist Frank Luntz. ``Everything he says, a Republican member
of Congress can respond: `And we should trust you?'''
	   Back in January, Clinton was unequivocal about asserting he did
not have a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. He gathered his
Cabinet and assured them the allegations were untrue.
Administration leaders put their reputations on the line defending
denials that later proved false.
	   ``I think the public confession could hurt,'' said Columbia
University political scientist Henry Graff. ``We're prurient and
puritanical at the same time. We're going to have a stained
president and a momentarily stained presidency.
	   ``We might want to hope that no international crisis arises in
which a badly damaged president has to present himself as commander
in chief and order some kind of military action that will require
full public support,'' Graff said.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton underwent more
than 5 1/2 hours of grand jury questioning Monday about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. His attorney, David Kendall,
said the president ``testified truthfully'' and hoped the
appearance would end the investigation into the president's
``private life.'' Clinton planned to address the nation later
Monday, Kendall said. Clinton had been prepared by his lawyers to
acknowledge in his testimony that he had an ``inappropriate
relationship'' with the former White House intern and answer the
inevitable questions about whether it was sexual and whether he
sought to conceal it, advisers said. The speech being drafted for
Clinton acknowledged an intimate relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and
expressed regret at not setting the record straight sooner, an
official said on condition of anonymity. (US-CLINTON
INVESTIGATION-TESTIMONY)
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police arrested the son of a
leading Sinn Fein critic on suspicion he helped commit Northern
Ireland's worst-ever terror attack, a car bomb that killed 28
people and tore up the center of a small town. Police took Shane
Mackey, 19, and four other people at dawn Monday from their homes
near Omagh, scene of Saturday's blast, 70 miles (110 kilometers)
east of Belfast. Under British anti-terrorist law they can be
interrogated for up to a week before being released or charged. At
Stormont, the British government's headquarters in Northern
Ireland, police and military chiefs from both parts of Ireland
brainstormed Monday about how to rout Irish Republican Army
dissidents opposed to Northern Ireland's peace accord. (NORTHERN
IRELAND)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ After weekend meetings in Angola with the
Angolan and Namibian leaders, Congo's President Laurent Kabila
briefly returned Monday to his embattled capital, Kinshasa, where
he defiantly claimed he would defeat an advancing rebel army. Then
he headed to Lubumbashi to try to rally support. Kabila has been
traipsing from Cuba to southern Congo to Angola in recent weeks,
looking for friends to help hold off the rebels _ an army of his
former Rwandan allies, ethnic Tutsi fighters and disaffected
members of the president's own military. (CONGO)
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A suspect in the twin U.S. Embassy
bombings in East Africa has not admitted any role in the crimes or
implicated anyone else, the FBI said. Reports out of Pakistan,
where the man was apprehended, said the suspect confessed and named
his co-conspirators. The reports also said the man had ties to
renegade Saudi multimillionaire Osama bin Laden, who the United
States says is one of the world's major sponsors of terrorism. In a
joint statement, the FBI and Kenyan police identified the suspect
as Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, also known as Abdull Bast Awadh and
Mohammad Sadiq Howaida. He was arrested in Karachi after arriving
on a flight from Nairobi on Aug. 7, the day of the blasts in the
Kenyan capital and in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, that killed 257
people and injured more than 5,500. The FBI and Kenyan police
revealed no breakthroughs Monday. (EMBASSY BOMBINGS)
	   SYDNEY, Australia _ American adventurer Steve Fossett's dream of
flying his balloon nonstop around the world ended when a fierce
thunderstorm knocked him out of the sky, hurling him 29,000 feet
(8,840 meters) into the Coral Sea. The Chicago millionaire was
rescued late Monday by a yacht that plucked him out of a life raft
500 miles (805 kilometers) off Australia's east coast. He had
traveled 15,200 miles (24,460 kilometers), completing two-thirds of
his planned journey, since taking off from Mendoza, Argentina, on
Aug. 7. Fossett was safe and in good condition aboard the 60-foot
(18-meter) schooner Atlanta, which was on its own around-the-world
trip when it received a ham radio report that Fossett was down,
spokeswoman Judy Jasper said from Fossett's flight operation
headquarters in St. Louis. Fossett told Australia's TV 7 Network
that his 150-foot (45-meter)-high, helium-and-hot air balloon _ the
Solo Spirit _ was pulled into a hail and lightning storm whose
strong winds ruptured the balloon's Mylar skin. (BALLOON QUEST)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue-chip stocks rose sharply Monday as
investors looked for bargains amid turmoil in financial markets
abroad. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 149.85 points _ or
1.8 percent _ to 8,574.85 after wiping out an early 56-point slide.
The rally still left the Dow more than 750 points shy of record
terrain. The month-long slide from July 17's record of 9,337.97 has
been largely fueled by continuing turmoil on foreign markets and
signs of a domestic economic slowdown. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ After spending billions of dollars during the past
three months to prop up Russia's weak currency, the government gave
up on Monday and let the ruble's value drop by up to 34 percent.
The policy turnaround will hit long-suffering Russians hard,
raising the price of imports that make up a large percentage of
consumer goods, including groceries. It also could provide more
pain for Russia's 1,500 banks _ up to half already were expected to
go belly-up in the next few weeks. The government also said it
would halt payment on government treasury bills and impose a 90-day
moratorium on payments of foreign debt. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. government and the International
Monetary Fund urged Russian authorities Monday to act without delay
on economic reform measures that will be needed to bolster
investors' confidence following the decision to devalue the ruble.
``We believe it is critically important that the Russian
authorities move quickly to take actions to restore confidence,
including the adoption of a careful and cooperative approach to
dealing with its creditors and the full implementation of the
measures outlined in the Russian stabilization program agreed with
the IMF,'' U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said in a
statement. (IMF-RUSSIA)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A dlrs 57 billion megamerger of NationsBank
Corp. and BankAmerica Corp., creating the largest bank in the
United States, won final regulatory approval Monday from the
Federal Reserve Board. The merger, announced in April and approved
by a 6-0 vote at a closed meeting of the Fed, vaults the combined
bank ahead of the nation's two largest: Citicorp and Chase
Manhattan. With 4,800 branch offices in 27 states and assets of
dlrs 580 billion, it will become the largest bank in the United
States and the third largest in the world. (US-NATIONSBANK-BANK
AMERICA)
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz said Monday it has hooked
up with Shell to expand fuel-cell technology for cleaner cars, the
latest in a series of joint ventures between oil and car companies.
Daimler has been working on fuel cells since 1992, which use
hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity to power a vehicle.
Daimler has been looking for a way to produce hydrogen on board so
that the cars wouldn't have to carry special tanks. The
Stuttgart-based automaker said Shell will bring to the partnership
a technology for extracting hydrogen from hydrocarbon fuels such as
gasoline and diesel, meaning electric-car drivers in the future
could fill up at regular gas stations.

	   PARAMUS, New Jersey (AP) _ Toys R Us Inc.'s second-quarter
earnings dropped more than 60 percent from a year ago, hurt by weak
sales of video game players, virtual pets, plush dolls and action
figures. The world's largest toy retailer earned dlrs 13.5 million,
or 5 cents a share on a diluted basis, in the quarter ended August
1, compared with dlrs 36.7 million, or 13 cents a share on a
diluted basis, a year ago. The 1998 results included a dlrs 3.7
million charge for the early retirement of debt. Sales were dlrs
2.02 billion, compared with dlrs 1.99 billion last year.

	   PALO ALTO, California (AP) _ Hewlett-Packard Co. on Monday
reported marginally higher third-quarter profits, weighed down by
Asia's economic slump and slower demand for its high-tech products.
The results exceeded Wall Street's diminished expectations.
Hewlett-Packard, the world's third-largest computer company, earned
dlrs 621 million, or 58 cents a share on a diluted basis, in the
three months ended July 31. That was 1 percent higher than the
profit of dlrs 617 million, also 58 cents a diluted share, reported
a year ago. The company had slightly more outstanding shares in the
just-ended quarter. Revenue rose 5 percent to dlrs 10.98 billion
from dlrs 10.47 billion. (US-EARNS-HEWLETT-PACKARD)

	   PARIS (AP) _ Where do people flock to when they come to Paris?
Notre Dame? The Eiffel Tower? The Arc de Triomphe?
	   Yes, but even more are going to Disneyland.
	   The theme park outside Paris knocked Notre Dame out of first
place in the hearts of visitors to the capital last year, French
tourism officials said Monday.
	   Last year, Disneyland Paris drew 12.6 million visitors, compared
to the 12 million who visited Notre Dame, the Paris Regional Office
of Tourism said. The number included French tourists as well as
foreigners.
	   The theme park endured a shaky start six years ago. But now, the
make-believe world of Disney apparently has become more compelling
than France's real castles and cathedrals.
	   On a busy day, the wait for rides like Space Mountain and Big
Thunder Mountain can stretch to two hours, longer than the wait to
get to the top of the Eiffel Tower, now in third place with 5.7
million tourists last year.
	   The Louvre Museum and the Georges Pompidou Center followed with
5.1 million and 4.4 million people respectively.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Former Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, who is guiding the reconciliation process in post-apartheid
South Africa, will spend a year teaching at Emory University in
Atlanta.
	   Tutu is to preside over a session of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission in Cape Town on Wednesday. He will leave
that night for Atlanta, Tutu spokesman John Allen said.
	   Tutu is expected to return to South Africa on Oct. 28 to present
President Nelson Mandela with the commission's final report.
	   The Anglican priest will work on a book this fall and not take
on any classroom duties. He will teach two courses in the spring,
with the topics to be determined later, Emory spokeswoman Elaine
Justice said Monday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Sophia Loren, hospitalized with an irregular
heartbeat, will take a month to rest after she is released, her
husband says.
	   Loren flew to New York from Geneva on Aug. 10 to visit a friend
and grew fatigued, said her spokeswoman Beebe Kline.
	   Ms. Kline said she didn't know when Loren, 63, was admitted, and
she refused to identify the hospital. The actress was expected to
be released Monday.
	   ``She seems in good shape. She's just been on a merry-go-round.
They wanted to run some tests for the arrhythmia,'' Ms. Kline said.
``It's so unusual for her not to feel well. She's always been a
pretty healthy person.''
	   Arrhythmia is a heart rhythm abnormality that can be fatal.
	   Loren's producer-husband, Carlo Ponti, told Venice Film Festival
officials that she won't be able to attend their Sept. 3 ceremony
to receive an award honoring her career, according to the Milan
daily Corriere della Sera.
	   ``She must take a month to rest and look after herself,'' Ponti
said.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Carlos Santana wants Hispanic kids thinking
of dropping out of school to instead hitch their dreams to his
shiny new star.
	   The 51-year-old leader of the group Santana, was honored Monday
with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
	   Santana's hits include ``Black Magic Woman,'' ``Evil Ways'' and
``Oye Como Va,'' Spanish for ``Listen How it Goes.''
	   The star coincided with the launch of Cada Cabeza Es Un
Mundo/Each Mind is a World,'' the Hispanic Media Group's national
program to prevent Hispanic youngsters from dropping out of school.
	   ``I am honored to receive a star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame
and to be able to use this occasion to help launch an important
national program like Cada Cabeza makes it all the more special and
worthwhile,'' the entertainer said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ As the anniversary of Princess Diana's death in
Paris approaches, 70 percent of French people want a street or
plaza to be named after her, according to a survey.
	   In the Gallup poll, to be published in Tuesday's France-Soir
newspaper, 26 percent of respondents were against the idea, and 4
percent had no opinion.
	   Diana was killed last Aug. 31 in a car crash in the Pont de
l'Alma traffic tunnel. Since then, a makeshift memorial has formed
at the nearby Flame of Liberty, originally set up to honor
French-American ties. Visitors are mainly tourists.
	   The poll was conducted by telephone Aug. 13-14 among 1,002
people over the age of 15. Margins of error for such polls are
usually plus or minus 2-3 percentage points.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Imprisoned securities trader Nick Leeson, who had
a cancerous tumor removed from his colon last week, has been given
a 70 percent chance of surviving for another five years, his
London-based lawyer said Monday.
	   Leeson, 31, was convicted of fraud and forgery that led to the
1995 collapse of Barings Bank, Britain's oldest merchant bank. He
was diagnosed with cancer Aug. 5 after serving more than 2 1/2
years of a 6 1/2 year prison sentence in Singapore.
	   Initial reports said the cancer had spread to his lymph nodes,
but lawyer Stephen Pollard said surgeons now believe that is not
the case.
	   He faces a 30 percent chance of the cancer recurring within the
next two years, Pollard said.
	   Leeson, who is recovering in the prison ward of the New Changi
Hospital, has applied for early release from prison.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MALIBU, California (AP) _ A photographer accused actor Sean Penn
of hitting him with a rock Monday for videotaping the actor while
he walked with his father.
	   No immediate charges were filed against Penn, whose turned 38 on
Monday. Penn's publicist, Carol Stone, had no comment.
	   Penn told sheriff's deputies he was walking along a rural road
with his father, director Leo Penn, when Michael Sindell confronted
him.
	   ``They exchanged some words and there was a brief altercation.
At this point, both sides are accusing each other of assault,''
Deputy Bob Killeen said.
	   The photographer claimed Penn hit him with a rock. Penn claims
the photographer lunged at him and was hit, Killeen said.
	   Penn served more than half of a 60-day jail term last year for
violating parole by punching an extra during filming of ``Colors.''
He was on parole for slugging a man he accused of trying to kiss
then-wife Madonna in a nightclub in 1986.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ American diplomats and Serb
officials conferred behind closed doors on ways to set up talks
between the Yugoslav government and Kosovo rebels on the future of
separatist Kosovo province.
	   The U.S. diplomatic initiative headed by envoy Christopher Hill,
may be successful but the talks, once they resume after they broke
down in May, may not.
	   Such negotiations are boycotted by ethnic Albanian opposition
parties and the Kosovo Liberation Army fighting for independence of
the Serbian province, where Albanians account for 90 percent of the
population of 2 million. Kosovo is in Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   In Belgrade, an American diplomatic source said Monday's meeting
was meant to ``keep this momentum to resume negotiations.''
	   He referred to the announcement last week of an ethnic Albanian
negotiating team that contains only associates of pacifist leader
Ibrahim Rugova, who also wants Kosovo's independence but is
despised by the KLA.
	   Both sides in the U.S.-Serbian meeting expressed hope that a
dialogue would resume to resolve the protracted Kosovo crisis, but
no details were revealed.
	   Fighting ebbed Monday, following a weekend push when Serbian
forces captured a series of key Albanian strongholds.
	   Tanjug said Monday that Serbian police ``crushed'' KLA bases in
the villages of Lodja, Grabovac and Rausic, all on the outskirts of
the province's second city of Pec on Sunday.
	   The pro-Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported sporadic
fighting and shooting in the border area near Junik, apparently
mop-up operations after government forces took control of the
village, formerly a major guerrilla stronghold.
	   The center also accused Serbs of setting ablaze parts of
villages from where the armed militants were purged.
	   Meanwhile, the two sides exchanged allegations of atrocities.
	   The Kosovo Information Center said an official of Rugova's
Democratic League of Kosovo died in a Pristina hospital after being
beaten by police in a prison of his hometown Urosevac, 35
kilometers (20 miles) to the south.
	   Conversely, Tanjug said the mutilated bodies of two Serb
policemen missing since July 6 were found Monday in Lodja where
government forces forced KLA rebels to retreat.
	   Another policeman, wounded in the same village July 6 but
evacuated and hospitalized, died Monday in the main military
hospital in Belgrade, it said.
	   Two other Serbian policemen were killed Sunday and Monday in
different parts of Kosovo, the pro-government Serbian Media Center
in Pristina reported.
	   The United Nations now estimates that more than 231,000 people
have been uprooted in the six months since the conflict began. Many
of them have fled across the mountainous border with Albanian,
where the KLA also maintains bases.

Scientists set to probe frozen Arctic graves for deadly virus

	   LONGYEARBYEN, Norway (AP) _ Eighty years ago, the Spanish Flu
virus killed tens of millions before it disappeared. Scientists
trying to pry its secrets out of an Arctic cemetery are taking no
chances that they might bring it back to life.
	   The four-nation team believes frozen remnants of the virus are
in six bodies buried in permafrost in this island outpost north of
the Norwegian mainland. On Monday, they were assembling equipment
for exhuming the bodies.
	   The research team, which includes experts from Norway, Canada,
Britain and the United States, hopes the viral material that may
have been frozen in the bodies will permit the construction of a
genetic profile of the virus.
	   According to Kirsty Duncan, a Canadian medical geographer who
leads the 15-member team, that could help explain how the 1918
virus killed so many people and then disappeared.
	   ``My first focus in the next few weeks is safety,'' Duncan said.
	   Experts say there is virtually no chance of finding a living
sample of the virus that killed more people than fighting in World
War I. The virus, first detected at Fort Funstan, spread rapidly
among troops sent to Europe in World War I. Victims suffered a
sudden fever, chills, headache, malaise, muscle pain, pneumonia and
rapid death.
	   The illness ended up with the misnomer ``Spanish Flu'' because
Spain was neutral, and openly admitted an epidemic while warring
nations kept it secret, according to Tom Bergan, a Norwegian
physician on the team.
	   Duncan, 31, of the Universities of Windsor and Toronto in
Canada, began a quest to uncover the secrets of the Spanish Flu
five years ago, after reading of its depredation.
	   ``I was horrified when I realized that we still didn't know what
this disease was that killed 20 to 40 million people,'' she said
Monday.
	   Duncan believes frozen bodies of victims could provide tissue
samples holding the virus' secrets. She checked in Alaska, Iceland
and Russia until the search lead to Longyearbyen, a town with a
population of 1,200. It is a mining outpost on Norway's glacial
Svalbard Archipelago, just 950 kilometers (500 miles) from the
North Pole.
	   In a small cemetery, below a steep mountainside and the
weathered wooden derricks of a coal mine, she found the
gravemarkers of seven flu victims, all of whom died in the first
week of October 1918.
	   Duncan said the graves were hard to find. Svalbard did not
become Norwegian territory until 1925. Before that, there were no
church or government death records. Mining companies kept records,
but they seemed long-gone. However, a local schoolteacher had kept
them.
	   Duncan set up a team of experts and gained permission from local
and national authorities in Norway and from all but one of the
seven families of the victims buried in the graves.
	   Before the digging, the team will have erected an inflatable
tent over the graves. It has airlocks, like a space ship, to
prevent any contamination, however unlikely, from spreading.
	   The few scientists allowed to enter the tent will wear
protective clothing, and have outside air supplies. Precious
samples of the tissue will be sent, on separate aircraft, to
laboratories in Norway, the United States, Canada and England. The
work will take about three weeks, while analysis could take 1.5
years.
	   Local officials seem convinced there is no threat.
	   ``I have not felt that there is any unrest or fear,'' said
Svalbard Governor Ann-Kristin Olsen.

Searching for money, jobless men sign up for Kabila's army

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Holding in his hand a crumpled sheet of
paper covered with a diagram of an AK-47 assault rifle, Edmund
Mboyo is ready to go off to war for President Laurent Kabila _ if
he's paid.
	   Faced with an army of rebels approaching Congo's capital of
Kinshasa, Kabila has launched a massive drive to recruit new
soldiers to defend his troubled government.
	   ``The people must be brave,'' Kabila declares during a state
radio broadcast. ``This is the message I have for my people, I am
asking them to face up to this plot, to arm themselves, to support
their army, and to defeat the aggressors.''
	   Elsewhere, Kabila has been shuttling to countries near and far,
including Angola and Cuba, in search of support for his government.
	   But at home, Kabila's call to arms has been answered by
thousands of out-of-work men who sign up for the money, if not for
love of country.
	   ``Many of the men here haven't eaten for days, some of them have
been sleeping on the ground,'' Mboyo said of the thousands of men
who every day for more than a week have converged on Kinshasa's
main soccer stadium, where the recruiting is taking place.
	   On Monday, at least 10 trucks filled with young men, still in
their civilian clothes and unarmed, shipped off for short-term
training _ perhaps a few days worth, one recruiting officer said on
condition of anonymity.
	   From there, they'll head to a front line that each day
reportedly moves closer and closer to Kinshasa.
	   An initial wave of support from all quarters of society to join
Kabila's military ranks has dwindled, apparently leaving the job of
defending the city to the jobless.
	   Many now joining the army say they are desperate for a paycheck.
But it is far from certain whether they would get one _ many of
Kabila's soldiers-turned-rebels say they quit the government force
for lack of pay.
	   Although government statistics are not available, independent
surveys and estimates by international aid agencies indicate that
as many as 75 percent of Kinshasa's young men are out of work.
	   Gone unfulfilled are pledges by Kabila to rejuvenate an economy
left impoverished by former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Where weeks and months ago groups of men milled on streets
corners, they now line up in regimental rows on the dusty grounds
outside the soccer stadium.
	   The elite corps of Kabila's army _ mostly former Rwandan allies
_ defected weeks ago to join the rebellion. Those troops still
loyal to Kabila are already fighting to hold off the enemy's
advance.
	   One new recruit, Suku Landu Elusee, a 24-year-old unemployed
television repairman, suspects most of the president's new recruits
may not actually fight if they don't get paid.
	   ``If we go to fight it's because we have nothing else here,'' he
said. ``Joining the army means money for us and our families.''
	   Dozens of would-be recruits clustered on the stadium grounds to
discuss their khaki-colored future and the state of the country.
	   Asked for show of hands of how many had jobs, not one hand was
raised. Would they would fight for their country? A flurry of
hands.
	   Would they fight if they weren't paid? Hands drop, people murmur
and drift away from the gathering.
	   ``We're happy to be soldiers,'' said Mboyo, ``But the way to win
this war is to pay your soldiers.''

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Coils of barbed wire, mounds of sandbags
and sniffer dogs confront visitors to the temporary new U.S.
Embassy in Kenya's capital. Tense soldiers man barricades a block
away, and a sharpshooter glares down from the roof.
	   If a siege mentality prevails at the nine-story red brick
building on a quiet side street, it's understandable. Officials are
determined that what happened Aug. 7 won't happen again.
	   Just two kilometers (a little more than a mile) away stands the
badly damaged shell of the embassy attacked by a truck bomb,
killing 247 people and raising immediate questions about safety at
U.S. missions worldwide.
	   A sense of shock and emergency is evident too inside, where
embassy workers are crammed into offices of the U.S. Agency for
International Development.
	   ``The adrenaline is still pumping and you don't go back to
normal overnight,'' Stephen Nolan, the embassy's administrative
counselor, told reporters Monday.
	   Nolan said he feels safe at the temporary facility. More than
security concerns or the disarray of the sudden move, he added,
they are still dealing with the trauma of human loss. At least 46
people, a dozen of them Americans, were killed inside the downtown
embassy building.
	   No damage estimate has been issued for the five-story building,
where the bomb's violent impact smashed in windows and walls and
left mounds of wrecked cabinets, computers and desks. Nolan
characterized damage only in the millions of dollars, calling the
building ``a complete writeoff.''
	   ``We lost over 500 years of experience in terms of personnel _
that's the real loss,'' he said. And ``they were friends and
colleagues.''
	   Last week, trying to return to business as usual, the embassy
shifted functions to the USAID building. It is wedged into a
neighborhood where residents of adjacent flats are so close they
could peer in the embassy's windows while hanging laundry on their
balconies.
	   The close proximity may partially account for the tension of the
Americans guarding it, suspiciously scrutinizing all non-Americans.
``He's got to stay with you!'' an Air Force soldier barks at
American reporters, warning that they keep an eye on a Kenyan
colleague even though he has journalist's credentials.
	   Washington has sent a team of officials to look at interim
office space and study where the new, permanent embassy will be
located. No formal decision has been made on what to do with the
old embassy.
	   Some Kenyans have suggested turning the site into a memorial,
but that seems unlikely considering the value of prime downtown
real estate.
	   The United States holds a 99-year lease on the property, which
it secured from the Kenyan government before building the embassy
in the mid-1970s. As the leaseholder in perpetuity, it has the
right to rent out the building, raze it or build another.
	   Whatever happens, U.S. spokesman Chris Sharf said last week:
``We're not going back there _ that's for sure.''
	   On Tuesday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was
expected to stop briefly at the new site during her one-day trip to
Kenya and Tanzania, to show support for East Africans and embassy
staffers alike.
	   ``It's important for her to be here and important for us to have
her come,'' Nolan said.

Security Council meets to consider Iraq response
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS and UPDATES with council approving letters. TRIMS
outdated material. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With Iraq still defiant in its standoff
with U.N. weapons experts, the Security Council has approved a
muted message of support for inspectors that backs their work but
leaves it up to them to decide whether to test an Iraqi ban on
searches.
	   Council members on Monday finalized drafts of letters to send to
the top two weapons inspectors, who reported last week that their
work was being undermined by Baghdad's Aug. 5 decision to freeze
cooperation with the United Nations.
	   The council was expected to send the letters Tuesday. The drafts
fell short of what U.N. inspectors had sought when they asked for
council guidance on the impasse and indicated continued divisions
among the 15 members about how to deal with Iraqi noncompliance.
	   The drafts emerged after the council received a briefing on the
so-far unsuccessful outcome of meetings in Baghdad between U.N.
envoy Prakash Shah and Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   Iraq's ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, said Baghdad's decision was
unchanged.
	   ``We found nothing in Shah's initiative that would satisfy our
concerns,'' Hamdoon said. Negotiations in Baghdad with Shah were
continuing, but ``our concerns will have to be met,'' he said.
	   Iraq has demanded an end to sanctions imposed after Baghdad
invaded Kuwait in 1990, touching off the Gulf War. Iraqi officials
claim they have complied with U.N. resolutions demanding that they
destroy their long-range missiles and chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons.
	   Iraq froze cooperation with U.N. inspectors after the chief
inspector, Richard Butler, refused to certify that Baghdad had
destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Letters to Butler, the head of the U.N. Special Commission, and
the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed El
Baradei, were to try to encourage them to carry out their work in
the face of Iraq's new ban, diplomats said.
	   The resulting drafts didn't go so far as to encourage
inspections but instead repeated the council's backing for
inspectors' work.
	   According to a final draft of the letter, the council called
Iraq's actions ``totally unacceptable.'' It said council members
``reiterate their full support of the IAEA and UNSCOM in the full
implementation of their mandates.''
	   Russia, France and China _ traditionally more sympathetic to
Baghdad _ opposed U.S. efforts to give inspectors clear
instructions that they should conduct searches according to their
mandates, a Western source said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The letter ``doesn't explicitly instruct UNSCOM. It's more
reminding them that they have the power to do this themselves,''
said the source.
	   The tame response was an indication of the disunity in the
council but also was intended to try to force Iraq to make the next
major move, diplomats said.
	   If Baghdad blocks an inspection, council members could more
easily hold Baghdad in violation of U.N. resolutions and a February
agreement that gave them unconditional access to suspected weapons
sites. To date, the council has only said Iraq's Aug. 5 freeze on
inspections ``contravened'' the agreement, a semantic detail which
prevented council members from taking tougher action.
	   ``What is happening right now is a record is being established,
a documentary record of Iraq's violations and its refusals to
comply,'' Richardson said.
	   Richardson called the letters strong, though he said the council
must now rely on Secretary-General Kofi Annan to try to work out an
end to the crisis.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Monday that Annan sees no
personal role in the standoff.

	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Geoff Grant beat Slava Dosedel in
straight sets Monday in the only match to be completed before rain
halted much of the first day of play at the Pilot Pen International
tennis tournament.
	   The rain had stopped by nightfall, allowing workers to dry one
court for the two scheduled evening matches: Alex O'Brien, the 1996
tourney champ, was to face Max Mirnyi, and Marat Safin was to play
Mark Woodforde.
	   A constant rain earlier in the day left several matches
dangling, including that of Jan Siemerink, the highest seed playing
Monday. The ninth seed from the Netherlands took a 5-4 lead over
Ecuadoran Nicholas Lapentti into the locker room.
	   Crowd favorite MaliVai Washington was leading 6-4, 1-3 when rain
stopped his match against Canadian Sebastien LaReau.
	   Grant, a wild card player, won 6-2, 6-3 over Dosedel and faces
Wimbledon finalist Goran Ivanisevic on Tuesday.
	   ``It really couldn't be a better time to have that kind of
challenge,'' Grant said.
	   He has won twice on the Challenger Tour this year and said he is
especially pleased with his service returns, which will be needed
against the big-hitting Ivanisevic, who is seeded eighth.
	   Grant broke Dosedel's serve five times en route to the win.
	   Israeli Harel Levy was leading 7-5, 5-3 over Argentinian
Guillermo Canas and Frenchman Nicholas Escude was leading 6-4, 0-1
over German Rainer Schuttler when rain halted play.
	   Six day singles matches were postponed without players even
taking the court. Monday's day matches were pushed back to Tuesday.
	   Washington said he would rather have continued playing, but said
weather delays are just part of the game.
	   ``If you can deal with it over in London at Wimbledon ... you
can deal with it anywhere,'' he said.
	   Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras, the tournament's top seed, is
scheduled to play his first match Wednesday. Defending champ
Yevgeny Kafelnikov also had a first-round bye and is expected to
play Tuesday.

Most wanted criminal in Barbados has death sentence overturned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ A mercy tribunal has overturned the
death sentence for Barbados' most famous ex-fugitive, the Barbadian
governor-general's office said Monday.
	   The Barbados Privy Council, a tribunal of island citizens that
considers appeals of sentences, ordered that 34-year-old murder
convict Winston Hall be imprisoned for life.
	   Hall was long considered Barbados's most-wanted criminal. He and
two other men, David Oliver and Peter Bradshaw, were sentenced to
hang in 1985 for the murder of the manager of Francia Plantation, a
farm on Barbados.
	   He escaped from police that year while on the way to a
courthouse and was recaptured in 1989 while stowing away on a
cruiseliner in St. Vincent.
	   He, Oliver and Bradshaw broke out of prison again in September
1991. Oliver and Bradshaw were captured soon afterward, but Hall
remained a fugitive until he was arrested in Trinidad and Tobago
earlier this year on an arson charge.
	   Oliver and Bradshaw also saw their death sentences converted to
life terms in prison because of a ruling by the British Privy
Council that convicts should not be kept on death row for more than
five years.
	   The British Privy Council is the supreme court for former
British colonies in the Caribbean.
	   Hall is being kept in a high-security cell specially built to
hold him.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ An apparently drunk driver plowed his car
into a block party injuring 12 people, mostly teen-agers, the
government news agency Notimex reported Monday.
	   The party celebrating a girl's 15th birthday, a major event in
Mexican culture, was held in the street, not uncommon in poor
Mexico City neighborhoods.
	   The injured were between ages 9 and 15, Notimex said.
	   Party guests tried to lynch the car's owner and his son who was
driving, Notimex said.
	   Police rescued owner Hector Solache Chavez. He was taken to a
hospital with serious injuries. The name of the driver, who is a
minor, was not released.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ An estimated 300,000 Bogota motorists
are forbidden from driving their cars during rush hour under a
four-month trial that takes effect Tuesday in one of Latin
America's most congested cities.
	   Under the restrictions, drivers must take turns garaging their
cars during peak weekday morning and afternoon hours, according to
the last number of the vehicles' license plates. Violators face a
dlrs 25 fine equivalent to five times the minimum daily wage.
	   Bogota officials hope the prohibition will unclog arteries in a
chaotic metropolis where it can take two hours to cross town during
rush hour.
	   Buses, one of the city's main sources of congestion, are exempt
from the rules.
	   Skeptics say the measure, which resembles restrictions that had
limited success in other Latin American capitals such as Mexico
City, Caracas and Venezuela, could be circumvented by those who
acquire forged license plates, buy a second car or alter their
schedules to avoid rush hour. Tie-ups could occur all day instead
of just at rush hour, they warn.
	   ``The cure could be worse than the illness,'' influential
columnist Enrique Santos Calderon wrote in El Tiempo newspaper
Sunday.
	   Santos called the measures well-intentioned, however, and said
they would test the civic spirit of Bogotanos, who have grown to
accept originally controversial laws prohibiting late-night alcohol
sales and reserving some arteries for bicyclists and walkers on
Sundays and holidays.
	   ``It will be an interesting experiment, '' he wrote.

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Fifteen prisoners at a
jail in San Cristobal de la Casas tried Monday to intimidate and
extort money from all 215 of their colleagues.Other prisoners,
armed with sticks and stones, fought back.
	   Five prisoners, apparently from both sides, were injured before
guards stepped in.
	   Jail Director Carlos Ramirez Cruz said the fight started in the
facility's main patio.
	   The injured were treated at a medical office inside the jail,
about 450 miles (725 kilometers) southeast of Mexico City.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Nine inmates who tried to climb a prison
fence to escape were thwarted by guards who opened fire on them,
the prison director said Monday.
	   While accomplices staged a fight in another part of the prison
to distract guards, nine inmates used a handmade wooden ladder to
try to scale the fence, said Victor Reyes Tapia, prison director
for Puebla, 65 miles (104 kilometers) southeast of Mexico City.
	   Guards in observation towers spotted the escape attempt and
opened fire. There were no injuries, Reyes Tapia told the
government news agency Notimex.
	   He said the inmates were confined in cells after the escape
attempt. In the Puebla prison, most inmates roam freely in a
central courtyard filled with restaurants, stores and prostitutes.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A giant high-frequency telescope being built
in Puebla state with U.S. and Mexican funding is expected to begin
operating in 2000, opening a new channel for scientists to study
the origins of the universe, a report said Monday.
	   The Grand Millimetric Telescope will be the largest and most
powerful of its kind in the world, project director Emmanuel Mendez
Palma told the El Universal daily. It will sit at an altitude of
15,945 feet (4,860 meters) on La Negra, Mexico's fifth-highest
mountain, southeast of Mexico City.
	   The telescope's parabolic antenna, measuring nearly 55 yards (50
meters) across, will pick up high-frequency waves emitted by
objects in the universe, Mendez Palma said.
	   ``Construction of the Grand Millimetric Telescope is a crucial
jump in the scientific and technological development of Mexico,''
he said.
	   At a cost of more than dlrs 60 million, the project is being
funded by Mexican and U.S. government institutes, as well as the
state of Massachusetts.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo approved the project in 1992, when he
was public education minister.

Russian devaluation shows solutions for global economy running out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARTIN CRUTSINGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Economics Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Russia's ruble devaluation, just a month after
promises of an additional dlrs 22.6 billion from the International
Monetary Fund, dramatically underscores the fact that the United
States and its rich allies are rapidly running out of solutions to
halt a deepening global economic crisis.
	   U.S. officials insist the key, as always, is for the countries
in trouble to take the painful reform steps necessary to put their
economies back on track.
	   But critics note that, so far, more than dlrs 100 billion in
bailouts assembled by the IMF for troubled Asian nations, and the
additional support Russia received last month, have not restored
confidence.
	   Russia's economy hit more turmoil Monday when the government of
President Boris Yeltsin, after spending billions of dollars in
recent months to prop up the weak ruble, announced it was letting
the currency's value drop by one-third and would impose a 90-day
moratorium on repaying some short-term debt to ease a cash crunch.
	   Russia has become the latest victim of a crisis that began 13
months ago in Thailand and has pushed a number of Asian countries,
including Japan, into severe recessions and rattled stock markets
from Hong Kong to New York.
	   Emerging markets such as Russia have been particularly hard-hit.
The spreading troubles have prompted investors to panic and try to
cash out holdings at the first sign of new troubles. The U.S.
economy has been jolted as well. The Dow Jones industrial average
is down 760 points from its July high on fears that Asia's troubles
will cut into American companies' profits.
	   ``The Asian situation is the worst economic event the world has
faced since the 1930s,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at
Primark Decision Economics. ``There is a risk of a global
recession.''
	   A growing number of critics contend those unending economic
troubles show that the old-time austerity religion preached by the
IMF and backed by the Clinton administration isn't working.
	   ``The whole purpose of an IMF program is to make up for foreign
capital that is pulled out of the country,'' said Lawrence
Chimerine, economist at Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington
think tank. ``It is silly to impose higher interest rates that make
the domestic economy weaker and give you more problems.''
	   But the Clinton administration continues to insist the only way
for countries to restore market confidence is to tighten their
belts.
	   ``We believe it is critically important that the Russian
authorities move quickly to take actions to restore confidence,''
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said in a statement Monday.
	   Russia's latest turmoil comes just two weeks before President
Clinton is scheduled to meet Yeltsin in Moscow. The two leaders
spoke by telephone on Friday.
	   A senior administration official, speaking Monday on condition
of anonymity, said Russia had sought additional international
support to stave off a devaluation. But the unanimous view of G-7
officials was that the critical element to stabilize Russia was
reform inside the country _ not extra money, the official said.
	   In return for the dlrs 22.6 billion IMF commitment last month,
Yeltsin's government agreed to austerity measures, including
stepped-up efforts to collect taxes. But the Russian parliament has
failed to approve those measures.
	   Even with the focus on Russia, the Clinton administration and
private economists continue to believe the key to resolving the
Asian crisis lies with Japan, the world's second-largest economy.
It must take steps to get its economy growing again, these
officials believe.
	   New Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has pledged to accelerate
efforts to jump-start Japan's economy and deal with more than dlrs
600 billion in banks' bad loans. But so far, financial markets have
remained skeptical about how fast and how far Obuchi will go.
	   Until Japan halts the slide in its own currency and resumes
economic growth, its troubled Asian neighbors are not likely to
stabilize, said Daniel Tarullo, who until March coordinated the
administration's response to the Asian crisis inside the National
Economic Council.
	   ``Far and away the most important thing that can happen is a set
of sustained, forthright actions by the Japanese government,''
Tarullo said.

Albright bringing message of American support to Tanzania, Kenya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. Will be led after Albright's arrival scheduled for
0500 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright headed Tuesday to East Africa, seeking to demonstrate
American support after the bombings that targeted U.S. embassies,
but mostly claimed African lives.
	   ``To America's embassy personnel in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, I
will bring a message of solidarity in their sorrow, admiration for
their courage and support for their continued efforts on behalf of
our country,'' Albright said Monday before leaving Andrews Air
Force Base, Maryland . ``To the people of Kenya and Tanzania, I
will bring a message of friendship, made deeper by our shared
grief, and of support in doing all we can to ease their suffering
and help them start anew.''
	   Albright, after a 16-hour flight, is scheduled to spend only
five hours on the ground in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, her first stop
Tuesday morning, and then about 5 1/2 hours in Nairobi, Kenya,
later in the day before returning immediately home.
	   Albright's visit to East Africa was designed in part to
demonstrate U.S. resolve in the face of growing terrorist threats
to Americans.
	   Some Kenyans have complained that after the Nairobi bombing,
rescuers gave priority to finding American victims and to
protecting evidence at the expense of saving African lives. But
Albright and other U.S. officials have strongly disputed that
notion, saying the priority had been rescuing all possible, African
and American.
	   On Friday, when Albright set aside vacation plans for the
hastily planned trip to East Africa, the State Department lifted a
warning against travel to Kenya, whose economy relies heavily on
foreign visitors, to further ease any strain in the aftermath of
the tragedy.
	   Just ahead of Albright's one-day trip, the State Department on
Sunday issued an updated ``worldwide caution'' to U.S. travelers in
the aftermath of the Aug. 7 bombings at American embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania and because of fresh threats to U.S. interests abroad.
	   An accompanying statement specifically warned ``against all
travel to Pakistan.'' The State Department also ordered the
departure of all non-emergency personnel and families of employees
from the embassy at Islamabad and from U.S. consulates in Karachi,
Lahore and Peshawar.
	   The warnings came after Pakistan handed over to Kenyan officials
a suspect in the U.S. Embassy bombings, Mohammed Saddiq Odeh, also
known as Mohammad Sadiq Howaida and Abdull Bast Awadh.
	   The first batch of evidence from the Nairobi bombing arrived
over the weekend at the FBI lab at the bureau's Washington
headquarters and is being analyzed, FBI officials said Monday.
	   Many more shipments are expected, but the first batch contained
cotton swabs taken at the blast site in hopes of picking up
microscopic residues that could positively identify what the bomb
was made of. A U.S. official said last week that field tests
suggested the presence of a Czech-made plastic explosive called
Semtex that has been used by terrorist groups before.

Did he or didn't he? Controversy over Chris Webber and marijuana

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Did the bag hold high-heel shoes
and other ``female items'' _ or size 16 sneakers and marijuana in a
sock? Did Chris Webber claim ownership of the bag and pay a dlrs
500 fine? If he didn't, who's the mysterious girlfriend who did?
	   Both the U.S. Customs Service and Webber's agent stuck to their
guns Monday, telling very different tales about a small amount of
pot that drew the Sacramento Kings player into yet another
confrontation with the law.
	   Customs reported Friday that Webber admitted he owned a carry-on
bag found with 11 grams of marijuana in the transit lounge of San
Juan's international airport and paid an administrative penalty of
dlrs 500.
	   On Sunday, Webber's agent, Fallasha Erwin, cried foul, saying
his client ``vehemently denies'' he had possession of the marijuana
and did not pay any fine.
	   The bag was claimed by Webber's female companion, who paid the
penalty, Erwin said without identifying the friend.
	   ``However, for unknown reasons, officials listed Chris Webber as
the owner of the bag, not the traveling companion,'' Erwin said. In
a telephone interview, he implied that the customs officers tried
to tie the marijuana to Webber, making out the receipt for the fine
paid by his friend in Webber's name and refusing to change it when
he protested.
	   He said Webber's attempts to clear his name caused him to miss
his flight to Barbados. The player is on a tour sponsored by the
sporting goods company Fila and had been accompanied by about a
half dozen of that company's officials and Detroit Pistons player
Jerry Stackhouse.
	   Erwin said a Fila representative was with Webber throughout the
confrontation at the airport. Fila issued a statement Monday night
saying it had asked Webber to cut short his trip to Barbados so
they could review the affair.
	   ``We expect our athletes to conduct themselves in an exemplary
manner on and off the court and we are taking this issue very
serious,'' said Jon Epstein, president of Fila U.S.A.
	   Customs officials were unmoved by Erwin's version of events.
	   ``We're sticking to our story. It happens to be the truth,''
spokesman Pat Jones said from the service's headquarters in
Washington D.C.
	   Webber's new team has declined to comment because the NBA and
its players are in the midst of a lockout.
	   Only heroin and cocaine are covered in the drug agreement
between the NBA and the union, but union director Billy Hunter said
last week they were nearing agreement to add marijuana to the list
of banned substances.

Tokyo stocks higher, dollar lower in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks opened higher on Tuesday, led by blue
chip exporters such as Sony Corp., following a rally overnight on
Wall Street. The U.S. dollar edged lower.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 81.71 points,
or 0.55 percent, to 14,876.37 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Monday, the Nikkei average plunged 329.27 points, or 2.18
percent.
	   The dollar bought 146.09 yen in early morning trading, down 0.36
yen from late Monday in Tokyo but above its late New York rate of
145.96.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which has fallen almost 10
percent since its peak of 9,337.97 on July 17, rebounded Monday,
soaring 149.85 points, or 1.8 percent.
	   The Dow, which has been volatile recently, shrugged off the news
Monday that Russia implemented a sharp devaluation of its currency,
along with a forced restructuring of domestic debt.
	   Wall Street's rally boosted shares of Japanese high tech
manufacturers, whose fortunes are closely tied to sales in the U.S.
market.
	   Exporters Sony, TDK Corp. and NEC Corp. all gained.
	   Stocks also got a boost as investors started buying after
judging prices had fallen far enough given earnings expectations,
traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 6.14 points, or 0.53 percent, to 1,158.17. The
TOPIX tumbled 16.77 points, or 1.43 percent, on Monday.
	   In currency trading, the U.S. dollar slipped after Japanese
officials repeated their willingness to intervene to prop up the
ailing yen.
	   On Monday, Haruhiko Kuroda, who heads the Finance Ministry's
International Bureau, and Eisuke Sakakibara, vice finance minister
for international affairs, both said Japan was committed to
defending the yen.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.155 percent from Monday's finish of 1.150
yen, pushing its price down to 112.07 yen from 112.11 yen.

Rogue firms in India's job-strapped software industry promise U.S.
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ In the business world, they're called
head hunters. In the software trade, employment agents are called
body shoppers, and India has become a vast arcade offering new
talent seeking high paying jobs abroad.
	   But the industry is rife with fraud, and computer engineers are
increasingly becoming victims of high-tech swindlers.
	   K. Sambasiva Reddy gave up his job and paid his life savings of
350,000 rupees (dlrs 8,300) to register with a company promising
him specialized training, a visa and a job in the United States.
	   Neither a visa nor a job materialized. A year later, Reddy
poured gasoline and tried to burn himself to death in despair at
being cheated. He survived, and his evidence later led to the
arrest of the company's owner.
	   Dozens of advertisements appear every week in Indian newspapers
appealing to computer professionals. Some body shoppers are
legitimate. Their candidates land good American jobs, joining some
1 million ethnic Indians living in the United States.
	   But some companies are bogus. Their clients often languish in
cramped apartments, shuttling between job interviews for which they
are underqualified. Some, like Reddy, don't go at all.
	   Body shopping is proliferating in a country with world-class
manpower in an industry growing by 55 percent a year, but where
venture capital is scarce. A software firm lacking finance may find
it easier to market its engineers than its product, trade officials
say.
	   The practice will grow even more if the U.S. government raises
its ceiling of visas for highly skilled workers to 190,000
annually. The American high-tech industry has been clamoring for an
increase in H-1B visas, now capped at 65,000. That limit was hit in
May, four months before the start of the new fiscal year.
	   ``This is the highest priority item for our industry,'' John
Boidock, vice president of government relations for Texas
Instruments, said in Washington. The Senate in May swiftly adopted
the legislation, but it has run aground in the House amid criticism
over a lack of safeguards ensuring Americans wouldn't be displaced
by cheaper foreign labor.
	   The passage of the bill is likely to lead to a spurt in the
number of Indian computer engineers moving to U.S. jobs.
	   ``Over 60 percent of Indian firms indulge in body shopping,''
said R.H. Naqvi, executive director of the federally-funded
Electronics and Computer Software Export Council, one of the
largest industry bodies in the country with over 700 members.
	   Naqvi said only 5 percent of all software companies were engaged
in actual on-site software projects abroad and in developing new
packages.
	   ``The big players are committed and honest, but some small
companies see this as a quick moneymaking opportunity,'' said Ravi
Warriar, president of Advanced Technology Labs. ATL partners
Microsoft in teaching engineers the Computer Object Model _
Microsoft's showpiece technology _ and then provides them
employment in the United States.
	   ``Mavericks know how to make a quick buck in a boom market,'' he
said. ``They falsify documents to push people to the States. There
are several cases of people starving because they did not have the
qualifications which were claimed and so didn't get jobs,'' Warriar
said.
	   India's software industry employs between 150,000 and 200,000
skilled workers, according to industry estimates.
	   For companies in the employment business which lure these
professionals, the 1996 U.S. immigration legislation in the U.S.
marked a significant victory.
	   Technology concerns lobbied successfully for the elimination of
language that would have restricted business immigration, allowing
software companies to continue hiring foreign engineers because of
a shortage of qualified U.S. college graduates. Many Indian
computer experts have three-year visas that may be renewed for
another three.
	   A powerful conglomerate of Indian software companies said it
will launch a clampdown this month on firms found defrauding
engineers.
	   ``We are beginning with an advertising campaign to make people
aware of the way these companies operate,'' said Dewang Mehta,
director of the National Association of Software and Service
Companies. The campaign will begin in Hyderabad, the southern city
that has become India's fastest developing high-tech center.
	   ``We have started taking strong action. We don't want people to
be cheated by these fraud firms,'' he said.
	   But that might be difficult in a country where few laws exist to
regulate the industry.
	   ``The training business has become like a travel agency
business,'' Warriar said. ``Give them money, they get you a visa
and they take you to the U.S.''

Senator wants tougher prison sentences for illegal abortions in
</HEADLINE>
Chile &QL; 
 &UR; By EDUARDO GALLARDO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ In a country that already has Latin
America's toughest anti-abortion laws, a conservative senator has
proposed making them even tougher.
	   Abortion is illegal in all circumstances, and the law punishes
women obtaining abortions and the people providing them with prison
terms of up to five years.
	   Arguing that there are too many illegal abortions in Chile, Sen.
Hernan Larrain wants to increase possible prison sentences to up to
15 years.
	   Until 1989, abortions were legal only when the mother's life was
in danger. But the late Adm. Jose Merino, a dominant figure in the
former military dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, abolished
that exception, claiming modern medicine has enough resources to
make it unnecessary.
	   Because it is always illegal, it is impossible to determine the
exact number of abortions in Chile. But experts agree the country
has one of the highest rates in predominantly Roman Catholic Latin
America.
	   Estimates based on a variety of factors, including the 37,000
women seeking care every year at public hospitals for
abortion-related problems, put the annual number of abortions
between 150,000 and 175,000. About 1 in 50 women get an abortion in
any given year.
	   Larrain says that shows the law is ineffective and allows ``a
highly profitable abortion industry to develop.''
	   ``In 1996, for example, only 13 people were sentenced for
violating the anti-abortion law,'' Larrain said in an interview.
``It's clear that the current penalties have not been a
deterrent.''
	   His proposal changes the definition of abortion from a crime
against public morals to a crime against people, making the penalty
more severe.
	   The bill also would reduce sentences for women undergoing an
abortion if they report those responsible. A similar law exists for
terrorism.
	   Although convictions for women undergoing abortions are rare,
spending days or weeks in jail during a trial is common.
	   The fate of Larrain's bill is uncertain.
	   Socialist Sen. Carlos Ominami said it would only make illegal
abortions more expensive.
	   ``The measures to face this situation should include an
effective family planning program, a government support to
unmarried mothers,'' he said.
	   Justice Minister Soledad Alvear said she is totally opposed to
abortion.
	   ``But I think current penalties for abortion are strong enough,
and increasing them is not the correct way to go,'' she said.
``Instead, it is the duty of the government to develop policies
aimed at preventing situations that may lead to abortion.''

 &UR; Kipketer makes up for absence of many other stars &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ It may take a Kenyan to shine some
light on the European Championship in athletics.
	   Wilson Kipketer is now a Danish citizen, but he was born in
Kenya.
	   While Kipketer is eager to perform well at his first major
European competition as a Danish citizen, many other European stars
are staying away from the quadrennial event that starts Tuesday in
the Hungarian capital.
	   The most notable absentees are Sergey Bubka, the Ukrainian world
record holder in the pole vault and a six-time world champion, and
Marie Jose-Perec, the 200 and 400-meter Olympic champion from
France.
	   Bubka is skipping the championship because he said they didn't
figure in his training schedule. Perec is out because of a reported
squabble with the French track federation.
	   It leaves Kipketer, 800-meter world champion and record holder,
as probably the biggest star in the six-day championship.
	   With Bubka out, Russian pole vaulter Maksim Tarasov looks set to
take the pole vault crown, although he didn't sound particularly
excited about it.
	   ``I've never done the Europeans, only the world championships
since I was a junior,'' said Tarasov, whose greatest rival should
be French Olympic champion Jean Galfione. ``I live in Budapest, so
that's a reason I'm here.''
	   ``Apparently the Europeans aren't that interesting, there is no
money,'' added the '92 Olympic champion and silver medalist in last
year's worlds behind Bubka. ``I don't do the European indoors
either.''
	   ``I still want to save my best for the end of the season. I hope
you haven't seen my best yet.''
	   The field includes more than 1,300 athletes from 44 countries
with Germany fielding the largest team (123) followed by France
(103), Russia (101), Italy (83), Hungary (80) and Spain (76).
	   The event lacks depth, especially in the men's events.
	   The North Americans have been dominating the sprints this year,
while the Africans have been taking the distance races.
	   But world-class performances could come in the field events,
such as the high jump, triple jump, the shot put, hammer and
discus, in which European men usually dominate.
	   On the women's side, however, Europeans have been strong this
year, apart from the sprints.
	   Among the most watched women will be Germany's 33-year-old long
jumper Heike Drechsler, who is trying to equal the European record
of four straight gold medals in one event, which has been done by
two others, Janis Lusis in the javelin, 1962-1971, and Nadezhda
Chizhova in the shot put, 1966-74.
	   She looks in good shape to do it, coming off a jump of 7.05
(23-1 3/4) last week in Zurich. She also has a wind-assisted 7.12
(23-4 1/2) this season, her longest jump since winning the European
title four years ago.
	   Drechsler, coming off operations on both Achilles tendons 10
months ago, is free of injuries for the first time in three years.
	   Another German, Grit Breuer, will be trying to win her second
400-meter title after 1990 _ and a three-year drug ban.
	   The first medals to be awarded Tuesday will come in the men's
20K walk, the men's shot put and the men's 10,000 meters, where
Antonio Pinto of Portugal leads the field with a time of 27
minutes, 15.76 seconds this year.
	   In the shot put, Yugoslavia's Dragan Peric leads the Europeans
with 21.77 meters this season.

Industrial Hemp: Marijuana's straight cousin creeping into
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WOLF CREEK, Oregon (AP) _ In the woods of southern Oregon, where
deputies in camouflaged fatigues beat the brush each fall for
hidden marijuana plantations, Kevyn Woven strings his loom with the
straight cousin of the pot plant: industrial hemp.
	   Using hemp fiber and yarn imported from Poland, Romania, and
China, where cultivation and sale of industrial hemp is legal,
Woven creates rich, nubby fabrics in woodland colors that wind up
as boutique clothing and upholstery on custom-made furniture in
luxury homes.
	   ``It is my passion,'' said Woven, who is as eager to extol the
many virtues of hemp as he is to sell his fabrics.
	   Once sold primarily at hippie fairs and through ads in the back
pages of magazines with an environmental bent, goods made from
industrial hemp are moving into the mainstream. Adidas uses it in a
shoe, the Body Shop features a line of hemp cosmetics and BMW uses
it in some car interiors. There are even several beers made with
hemp.
	   ``I feel the industrial hemp crop could very easily be the
soybean crop of the new millennium,'' said Jeffrey W. Gain, a
former farm lobbyist who now is chairman of the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Alternative Agricultural Research and
Commercialization Corp.
	   Like soybeans, hemp produces an oil from its seeds that can be
turned into cooking oil, cosmetics and plastics. Hemp fiber can be
used to make paper, cloth and even structural panels stronger than
plywood. The seed can be ground for flour and livestock seed.
	   Growing hemp in rotation with cotton and other crops increases
their yields and reduces the need for pesticides.
	   ``It's really an amazing crop,'' Gain said.
	   Industrial hemp is the same species as marijuana, Cannabis
sativa, but it is a different variety which, due to genetics and
growing practices, has only a very small amount of
tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the stuff that makes pot smokers
high.
	   But even that small amount, less than 1 percent, is enough to
make it an outlaw in the eyes of Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the U.S.
drug czar who heads the White House Office of National Drug Control
Policy. He contends efforts to legalize hemp are a smokescreen to
legalize marijuana.
	   ``A serious law enforcement concern is that a potential
byproduct of legalizing hemp production would be de facto
legalization of marijuana cultivation,'' McCaffrey's office said.
``The seedlings are the same and in many instances the mature
plants look the same.''
	   Hemp advocates disagree. The 29 countries that allow farmers to
grow hemp, including Canada, France, Germany and England, are able
to work around the differences. And the thought of cross
pollination with low-THC hemp makes pot growers cringe.
	   Indeed, hemp was a strategic crop until the turn of the century,
when steam power took over for sail on ships, said John Roulac,
author of Hemp Horizons and founder of HEMPTECH, a hemp information
network.
	   ``Old Ironsides,'' the U.S.S. Constitution, went into battle
with sails, rigging and caulking made from it. U.S. founding
fathers George Washington and Thomas Jefferson grew it. The
Declaration of Independence was drafted on paper made from it.
Farmers could pay their taxes with it.
	   The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 spawned the rise of
cotton as the world's dominant fiber, though it was shorter, weaker
and rotted more easily than hemp.
	   The coup de grace came from the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937.
Though it allowed farmers to continue growing hemp, the government
wouldn't issue permits for them to ship their crops to processing
plants because a few leaves that might contain THC were left on the
stalks, Roulac said. By the end of 1938, every hemp factory in the
Midwest was shut down, except one with a contract to supply rope to
the Navy.
	   There was a brief resurgence during World War II, when the
federal government launched a ``Hemp for Victory'' campaign for
rope and parachute cord, but after the war, hemp was an outlaw
again.
	   Med Byrd, director of applied research at North Carolina State
University, sees hemp as part of the mix of plants _ including
wheat and rice straw and kenaf _ that will fill the growing global
demand for fiber.
	   ``There are signs the world could be facing a significant fiber
shortage early in the 21st century,'' Byrd said. ``One way of
looking at this is that there are about a billion people in China.
Each person in the United States uses about 700 pounds (318 kilos)
of paper per year. In a developing country like China, the figure
is closer to seven pounds (3.1 kilos).
	   ``Let's say the proper number for a well-educated society is 300
pounds of paper per person per year. Take the difference between
the Chinese figure of seven pounds (3.1 kilos) and the proper
figure of 300 pounds (136 kills) _ 293 pounds (133 kilos) _ and
multiply by a billion. We don't know where that fiber is going to
come from.''
	   As a source of paper, hemp is tough to work with, because its
fibers are longer than the wood fibers the nation's pulp plants are
set up for. But one big advantage is that hemp grows much faster
than trees, which is an important factor when you are playing
catch-up, Byrd added.
	   While the DEA argues that hemp is much more expensive than other
fibers, hemp advocates point out that difference would drop
immediately if hemp didn't have to be imported from Europe and
China. Canada decided to let farmers begin planting 5,000 acres
(2,000 hectares) this year.

Mackie's World: Specialty mall caters to kids

<TEXT>
	   GRAND RAPIDS, Michigan (AP) _ At the first mall for children,
conceived by husband-and-wife real estate developers as a tribute
to their 3-year-old son Mackie, parents shop where their kids want
to go.
	   The nearly dlrs 11 million enclosed mall has shoe, clothing and
music stores geared toward children, as well as a learning center,
a movie theater with car-shaped seats, and a food court that
includes one restaurant with more than 50 types of peanut butter
and jelly sandwiches.
	   For older children, there's a sports city with miniature golf,
basketball games and a racetrack. For the youngest, the mall
provides yellow cab-style strollers so their parents can taxi them
around.
	   ``Parents shop where their kids want to go,'' says Deb Colvin,
who began the project with husband, Pete, after their son died in
1995 of a rare intestinal disorder.
	   ``He would have loved it, especially the dinosaur,'' says
13-year-old Chris, Mackie's older brother, referring to the
life-size Tyrannosaurus rex that towers over the mall lobby.
	   The mall, which opened Aug. 15, grew out of a mealtime
discussion just two days before Mackie's death about the lack of
places for children to shop. It has since become an outlet for the
family's grief.
	   The Colvins say they hope profits from the mall will allow them
eventually to help neglected and abused children.
	   ``We wouldn't put Mackie's name on something that exploits
children,'' Mrs. Colvin says. ``The only way for us to help kids is
to do good business. You might not believe this of most developers,
but our main goal is to bring families together.''
	   Mrs. Colvin says the mall is perfect for a family town like
Grand Rapids, with about 200,000 people, 25 percent of them under
12.
	   ``We were finding in major cities there wasn't that much just
for kids, and you had to drive everywhere to get there,'' she says.
	   Coca-Cola and baby food-maker Gerber Products Co. agreed to put
their names on the project in exchange for the right to sell their
products. A bond sale on Wall Street netted more than dlrs 19
million.
	   ``I have seven grandchildren and I'm sure they'll want their
parents to come here every week,'' says Dixie Barnaby, one of 10
other investors who contributed dlrs 50,000 each.
	   The Colvins figure the mall will draw 2 million people a year
and could turn a profit by next year.
	   Mackie's World capitalizes on a growing trend toward specialty
malls, says Malachy Kavanagh, a spokesman for International Council
of Shopping Centers.
	   Other malls have created special areas for children, but he
knows of no mall dedicated to the younger set.
	   ``The only challenge they have is that as the population grows
up, there has to be a new generation to replace them,'' he says.

Northern Ireland prepares for first funerals from terrorist strike

	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP) _ With all 28 victims finally
identified and five suspects in custody, the family of a mother and
young daughter killed in a terrorist car bombing prepared to say
goodbye Tuesday in the first in a long line of funerals.
	   The carnage and confusion that reigned on Omagh's Market Street
after the 500-pound (200-kg) car bomb exploded Saturday meant the
bodies were not released to their loved ones until Monday.
	   ``I'm sure we'll have a series of funerals through the week,''
said the Rev. Lawrence Dawson, the Catholic parish priest presiding
over back-to-back services Tuesday in nearby Augher for 30-year-old
Avril Monaghan, pregnant with twins, and her 18-month-old daughter
Maura.
	   Mrs. Monaghan's 65-year-old mother, Mary Grimes, also was killed
in the bombing. She will be buried Wednesday.
	   The Irish Republic town of Buncrana almost came to a standstill
as the hearses bearing the coffins of three local boys killed in
the bombing _ James Barker, 12, Sean McLoughlin, 11, and Oran
Doherty, 8 _ arrived home Monday night.
	   Hundreds of people waited for several hours at the County
Donegal border to see the coffins cross over, and mourners lined
the town's streets and stood in tearful silence as they passed.
	   ``This has been one of the most difficult and emotional duties I
have ever had to supervise,'' police superintendent Tom Long said.
	   Mo Mowlam, Britain's top official in Northern Ireland, toured
the destruction in Omagh on Monday night and assured residents that
authorities would stop at nothing to nail the bombers, whom she
called ``animals, obscene in what they have done.''
	   ``I just can't get out of my head the pain, the suffering that
is going on,'' she said. ``That is overwhelming.''
	   At dawn Monday, police had arrested five people in connection
with the attack _ the worst in Northern Ireland's history. The
suspects included 19-year-old Shane Mackey, the son of a leading
critic of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party's support of April's peace
agreement.
	   No information was released about the suspects, believed to be
members of the ``Real IRA,'' made up of defectors from the Irish
Republican Army. Under British anti-terrorist law, the five can be
interrogated for up to a week before being released or charged.
	   Mowlam spent hours in talks Monday with police officials from
both Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, grappling with how to
foil any further such deadly attacks.
	   After the session, she announced increased army and police
deployments along the border between the two states, but refused to
reveal other details.
	   When asked, however, whether both governments were discussing
whether to change their laws so that Real IRA suspects could be
convicted based only on testimony from anti-terrorist detectives,
Mowlam said: ``You're in the right ballpark.''
	   The young Omagh suspect's father, local councilman Francis
Mackey, said his son had been arrested as part of a British
conspiracy ``to demonize me for being honest and open in expression
of my political opinions.''
	   Mackey, re-elected last year while still a member of Sinn Fein,
now aligns himself with the 32 County Sovereignty Committee, a
group opposed to the peace agreement. It is led by Bernadette
Sands-McKevitt, sister of the martyred IRA hunger striker Bobby
Sands _ and common-law wife of the Real IRA's reputed commander.
	   Talk of politics was markedly absent in many of the towns across
Northern Ireland that numbered residents among the dead and 220
wounded. More than 100 people remained hospitalized, including 11
in critical condition. Nine children died, and a number of people
were blinded or crippled.
	   ``People are suffering in shock,'' said Gordon McLaren, a
shopkeeper in Augher who shook his head at the enormity of the
Monaghan family's loss. ``Has anyone talked of politics? No, they
have not.''
	   For the first time in the three-decade course of Northern
Ireland's conflict, foreign tourists were among the dead _ a
teacher and a 12-year-old student from Spain.
	   Spain's deputy prime minister, Francisco Alvarez Cascos, toured
Omagh with relatives of the dead and of the 11 wounded Madrid
students, including two girls hospitalized in Belfast with critical
head injuries.

	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) _ Geoff Grant beat Slava Dosedel in
straight sets Monday in the only match to be completed before rain
halted play as the Pilot Pen International tennis tournament got
underway.
	   The rain stopped long enough to allow the start of one night
match, but a downpour about one hour later forced tournament
officials to call it a night and reschedule everything for Tuesday.
	   Tournament director Cliff Buchholz offered a positive spin.
	   ``Sometimes it's nice for the players to get a break. Some of
them probably need a day off,'' he said.
	   A constant rain earlier in the day left several matches
dangling, including that of Jan Siemerink, the highest seed playing
Monday. The ninth seed from the Netherlands took a 5-4 lead over
Ecuadoran Nicholas Lapentti into the locker room.
	   Crowd favorite MaliVai Washington was leading 6-4, 1-3 when rain
stopped his match against Canadian Sebastien LaReau.
	   Grant, a wild card player, won 6-2, 6-3 and faces Wimbledon
finalist Goran Ivanisevic on Tuesday.
	   ``It really couldn't be a better time to have that kind of
challenge,'' Grant said.
	   Grant has won twice on the Challenger Tour this year and said he
is especially pleased with his service returns, which will be
needed against the big-hitting Ivanisevic, who is seeded eighth.
Grant broke Dosedel's serve five times en route to the win.
	   Israeli Harel Levy was leading 7-5, 5-3 over Argentinian
Guillermo Canas and Frenchman Nicholas Escude was leading 6-4, 0-1
over German Rainer Schuttler when rain halted play. Alex O'Brien,
the 1996 Pilot Pen champ, had a one-set lead on qualifier Max
Mirnyi in the night match and was down 3-2 in the second set when
the rain put an end to Monday's competition.
	   Six day singles matches and one night singles match were
postponed without players even taking the court.
	   Washington said he would rather have continued playing, but said
weather delays are just part of the game.
	   ``If you can deal with it over in London at Wimbledon ... you
can deal with it anywhere,'' he said.
	   Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras, the tournament's top seed, is
scheduled to play his first match Wednesday.

Striking Hyundai autoworkers brace for police raid

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Thousands of striking Hyundai Motor
Co. workers braced for a police raid Tuesday as the government
tried to resolve a month-long labor dispute at the nation's largest
automaker.
	   Labor Minister Lee Ki-ho met with Hyundai's managers and union
leaders until past midnight Monday and asked both sides to submit
their final proposals by noon Tuesday.
	   ``We expect that it'll be the government's final mediation
effort,'' one Labor Ministry official said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   Both sides agreed to comply with the government's request but
union leaders said they did not expect ``any good results'' from
the mediation effort.
	   ``We see the minister's move as a face-saving gesture to justify
a police intervention,'' Kim In-hwan, a union leader, told The
Associated Press by telephone.
	   Kim said 5,000 striking workers and their families picketing
Hyundai's main plants in Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles)
southeast of Seoul, were prepared for a police raid.
	   ``We're prepared to die. Losing jobs are like facing death,'' he
said.
	   An estimated 15,000 riot police were massed around Hyundai's
plants in Ulsan to evict the striking workers and their families,
the national news agency Yonhap said.
	   Before dawn Tuesday, police reinforcements, backed by 50 armored
tear gas vehicles, water cannon-equipped trucks and bulldozers,
moved closer to the plants, but withdrew two hours later.
	   Hyundai Motor, a key subsidiary of the giant Hyundai group, the
nation's largest conglomerate, has been idle since July 20 when its
26,000-member union went on strike to protest spreading layoffs.
	   Hyundai's union wants the company to take back 1,600 workers it
fired July 31 because of sharply falling domestic sales.
	   The company, which earlier got rid of 6,100 workers by offering
them enhanced early retirement packages, insists it has to reduce
its work force in line with slumping demand for its cars.
	   Before starting his mediation effort in Ulsan Monday night, the
labor minister told reporters that the union must accept ``some
form of layoffs.''
	   ``The international market is closely watching how the Hyundai
dispute is handled. A flexible labor market is our promise to the
international community,'' he said.
	   A flexible labor market is a key part of reforms South Korea
promised to make in return for a dlrs 58 billion bailout package by
the International Monetary Fund in December.
	   The number of jobless people has since doubled to 1.5 million
and is expected to reach 2 million by year's end, a shock to South
Korean workers long accustomed to lifetime employment.
	   Hyundai's experience will set an example for other
conglomerates, including Samsung and LG, which reportedly plan to
shed up to 30,000 workers each by the end of this year.

Japanese stocks rebound, dollar drops against yen in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with midday stock, late morning bond and
currency prices; ADDS 3rd graf stock trader quote, 6th graf comment
from Prime Minister Obuchi &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks rebounded early Tuesday as
investors snapped up bargain-priced shares following a rally
overnight on Wall Street. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged 297.15
points, or 2.0 percent, to 15,091.81 as of midday. On Monday, the
average plunged 329.27 points, or 2.18 percent.
	   ``Selling yesterday was overdone, and Tokyo stocks may have
finally bottomed out,'' said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko
Securities Co.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which has fallen almost 10
percent since its peak of 9,337.97 on July 17, recovered Monday,
soaring 149.85 points, or 1.8 percent.
	   The Dow, which has been volatile recently, shrugged off the news
Monday that Russia implemented a sharp devaluation of its currency,
along with a forced restructuring of domestic debt.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, meanwhile, expressed worry
Tuesday that Russia's devaluation of the ruble could negatively
impact economies around the world, Japan's Nikkei news wire
reported.
	   Still, Wall Street's rally boosted shares of Japanese high tech
manufacturers, whose fortunes are closely tied to sales in the U.S.
market.
	   Stocks also got a boost as investors started buying after
judging prices had fallen far enough given earnings expectations,
traders said.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section rose 17.03 points, or 1.48 percent, to 1,169.06. The
TOPIX tumbled 16.77 points, or 1.43 percent, on Monday.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, meanwhile, the dollar
bought 145.46 yen in late morning trading, down 0.99 yen from late
Monday in Tokyo and also below its late New York rate of 145.96.
	   The dollar lost ground against the yen after top Japanese
officials repeated their willingness to intervene to prop up the
ailing yen, traders said.
	   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said Tuesday that
Japan will conduct yen-supportive intervention in the foreign
exchange markets if necessary.
	   Also Tuesday, Haruhiko Kuroda, who heads the Finance Ministry's
International Bureau, reiterated that excessive weakness in the yen
is ``undesirable.''
	   In the fixed-income security market, the yield on the benchmark
No. 182 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.160 percent from
Monday's finish of 1.150 yen, pushing its price down to 112.04 yen
from 112.11 yen.

Top class fleet for Olympic warm-up event

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Six defending Olympic champions will
contest a sailing regatta next month to test the waters two years
out from the Sydney 2000 Games.
	   The regatta is the first of two test events for Olympic sailing
and will be held on Sydney Harbor from Sept. 19-27, the actual
dates of competition in 2000.
	   Teams from 38 nations have entered the test event, according to
a Organizing Committee spokesman, with 344 competitors across the
10 classes.
	   The Europe dinghy single-handed class has the most impressive
women's fleet led by Danish Olympic champion Kristine Roug, silver
medalist Margriet Matthysse from the Netherlands and her world
champion compatriot Carolyn Brouwer.
	   The men's Finn dinghy single-handed class will feature the
Atlanta gold and silver winners, Poland's Mateusz Kusnierewicz and
Belgium's Sebastien Godefroid, and world champion Fredrik Loof of
Belgium.

Unicef calls situation in Indonesia international emergency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Multiple threats to the health, well being
and basic education of Indonesia's children constitute an
international emergency, UNICEF said Monday.
	   Four million children under the age of 2 are severely
malnourished and more than 30 percent of the country's children are
at risk of failing to complete primary school, UNICEF chief Carol
Bellamy said in a release.
	   ``The fate of millions of Indonesian children and women is at
stake,'' she said. In addition, civil unrest has ``led to egregious
violations of human rights.''
	   Indonesia's economic crisis has seriously devalued the currency
and nearly doubled the cost of food, fuel and other basic consumer
goods.
	   Over dlrs 50 billion in emergency loans by the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other agencies may not be enough
to turn things around, Bellamy said.
	   On the nutritional front, UNICEF is still well short of the dlrs
18 million a year needed to feed young children, despite generous
grants from Australia, Canada, Norway, the United States and
others, Bellamy said.

 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ ``My gosh, I'm going to die,'' Steve
Fossett thought as his round-the-world balloon ripped apart in a
violent storm and plummeted 29,000 feet (8,800 meters) to the
shark-infested Coral Sea.
	   ``As I was going down, the balloon was just being thrown from
one side to another,'' the millionaire American adventurer said
Tuesday from the New Zealand naval ship Endeavour, which helped
rescue him.
	   Some 10,000 lightning strikes were recorded in the Coral Sea
area.
	   He said he saw huge sheets of hail, and laid down on the bench
in the capsule to prepare for the impact in the water.
	   ``Happily, the impact wasn't so bad,'' he said in an interview
with his mission control headquarters at Washington University in
St. Louis, Missouri. Fossett believes the capsule and the water
absorbed much of the impact of Monday's crash.
	   His capsule was falling at about 30 mph (48 kmph) while he used
burners under the damaged mylar balloon bag to slow the rate of
descent.
	   But he had told Australian TV that a fire broke out in his
capsule on impact, forcing him to ditch it and climb into a life
raft.
	   Fossett was being checked by medics on board the Endeavour but
was in fairly good health. He told his mission control people he
suffered half-inch (1.2 cm) burns on his wrist and nose but
otherwise was OK.
	   Fossett, who vies with British tycoon Richard Branson for the
title of the world's top balloonist, boarded the Endeavour on
Tuesday morning after being picked up overnight by the 18-meter
(60-foot) yacht Atlanta, on its own globe-circling trip, about 500
miles (800 km) off Australia's east coast.
	   Fossett was on the home leg of his fourth attempt to be the
first balloonist to fly non-stop around the world when his balloon,
Solo Spirit, was forced down in a thunderstorm.
	   Fossett set off from Mendoza, Argentina, on Aug. 7 and had
already broken his own distance record of 10,360 miles (16,673 km)
set in January 1997.
	   He had gone two-thirds of the way around the world, more than
15,200 miles (24,461 km) before the storm damaged the balloon,
sending it plunging into the sea.
	   His electronic position indicator beacon activated, sparking an
international search and rescue effort. A French military plane
from Noumea, New Caledonia, dropped him a life raft on Monday
morning containing food, water and a canopy to shield him from the
tropical sun.
	   Australian military rescue flights circled overhead Monday until
rescue ships could reach his position.
	   He is expected to arrive in Townsville, Australia, on the
Endeavour by Thursday evening.
	   Fossett said other ships were being dispatched to the area in
hopes of salvaging some of the capsule's items, including film,
fuel tanks, and cameras on board for the filming of a documentary.
	   Fossett had a long stretch of the Pacific Ocean between
Australia and Argentina to go and had at least another five days of
travel before he was expected to reach South America.
	   The 54-year-old Fossett, from Chicago, was making his fourth
attempt to fly around the world. He has also run marathons, climbed
mountains and raced in the Iditarod dog sled race in Alaska.
	   On his first around-the-world attempt in 1996, Fossett only
lasted 36 hours, ending up in eastern Canada.
	   His next try in January 1997 set a long-distance ballooning
record _ surpassed by Fossett on this trip _ and ended in
Sultanpar, India, where Fossett landed after running short of fuel
while awaiting clearance to fly over Libya.
	   In January, on his third effort, Fossett landed in a wheat field
in southern Russia.
	   Fossett's crash landing led to the sixth major rescue operation
in the seas surrounding Australia in recent years. Rescue costs,
which run into the millions of dollars, have been borne by
Australian taxpayers under international conventions covering
safety at sea.
	   There have been calls in recent years for ``contribution fees''
from around-the-world yacht race organizers, who receive hefty
commercial sponsorships, to help foot any rescue bills.
	   Had Fossett completed his flight, he would have set a world
record and won the Budweiser Cup and a U.S. dlrs 1 million prize.
Several more balloon syndicates plan to chase the prize in December
and January.

Coalition minority partner splits as Shipley warns of early
</HEADLINE>
election &QL; 
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ New Zealand's ruling coalition
splintered Tuesday under pressure from Prime Minister Jenny
Shipley, who warned her minor party counterparts to support her or
face an early election.
	   Two ministers of the minority coalition party New Zealand First
resigned and declared their support for Shipley, shoring up her
chances of holding on to power in a minority government.
	   Shipley needs a total of seven NZ First votes to secure her
government's hold on power. Sources told The Associated Press up to
three more NZ First cabinet ministers will support Shipley. This
would take her to within two votes of a majority in the 120-seat
Parliament.
	   The coalition has been in crisis for almost a week, after NZ
First leader Winston Peters led a walk-out of Cabinet after a
dispute over the sale of the government's stake in Wellington
airport.
	   Shipley sacked Peters and invoked dispute resolution procedures
under the coalition agreement which give the parties one week to
solve the row before the coalition can be formally ended.
	   Looking drawn and tense after a meeting Tuesday with his
legislators, Peters said he wanted the dispute resolution process
to go ahead immediately.
	   Government members from the two parties are scheduled to meet
for the first time since the defections mid-afternoon Tuesday.
	   Peters' apparent eagerness to solve the dispute is a signal some
NZ First members have threatened to quit the party if he pursued
his hallmark tactics of dragging out such talks as a publicity
spectacle, observers believe.
	   With her National Party holding just 44 votes in Parliament,
Shipley has the support of one other minority party and two
independents, but this is still not enough for a majority.
	   The government has not collapsed so far because there has been
no vote in Parliament on money bills or a confidence motion.
	   Opposition parties are clamoring for such a test of the
government, but have no immediate way of forcing a vote.
	   Gambling on a show of strength, Shipley on Monday said Peters
and NZ First had a choice about their future.
	   ``If he wants to precipitate a general election, he can,'' she
said in a television interview.
	   The airport was sold to a private sector investment company
Friday, with Peters' approval, after safeguards about New Zealand
retaining majority ownership were built into the sale agreement.
	   NZ First, ranking only 2-3 percent in opinion polls, is regarded
by National Party members as losers at the next election, which
would otherwise be expected in mid-1999.
	   Three recent polls in Peters' home electorate show he would
finish third in an election. Until now his home base has been
secure, another indication his party has worn out voter patience
with its antics in government.

Mickelson wins Pebble Beach tourney after six-month delay
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PEBBLE BEACH, California (AP) _ Against an idyllic backdrop,
Phil Mickelson won a tournament that began six months ago and
earned more than a half-million dollars in one round of golf.
	   Mickelson, rebounding from a lost weekend at the PGA
Championship, had six birdies in the final round Monday for a
one-shot victory over Tom Pernice in the AT and T Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am, a tournament that began in January.
	   The AT and T victory, his first since the opening week of the
season, earned Mickelson dlrs 450,000 as well as a dlrs 100,000
bonus for having the highest overall earnings in eight West Coast
events this year.
	   ``It was almost a golfer's dream to play Pebble Beach like
that,'' he said. ``To see those sea lions lying out on the rocks is
very relaxing. It was worth the wait.''
	   When the AT and T tournament began in late January, waves
crashed onto the 18th fairway. Sheets of rain turned sandtraps into
water hazards and gusty winds snapped treetops.
	   On Monday, months after the demise of El Nino, the tourney
resumed on an overcast, dry morning. The ocean was placid and there
was a cool breeze.
	   ``The course played totally different than it does in February
because the fairways were a lot firmer,'' Mickelson said. ``It was
such an enjoyable day to play Pebble Beach.''
	   Of the 168 pros who started the tournament, 125 returned for the
final round. Among those not returning were Tiger Woods, who
finished the second round 14 strokes off the lead, and Jack
Nicklaus. Also dropping out was Vijay Singh, who won the PGA
Championship on Sunday.
	   Mickelson's three-round total of 14-under 202 tied for the
lowest 54-hole score in AT and T tournament history. This was the
14th time the tournament had been shortened to 54 holes.
	   Pernice, playing the Poppy Hills course, was 13 under until he
three-putted No. 17 for a bogey. Still, he had an eagle putt on the
final hole with a chance to catch Mickelson, and missed it.
	   Jim Furyk shot a 68 on Pebble Beach to finish two shots behind
Mickelson. J.P. Hayes and Paul Azinger, playing on Poppy Hills,
also finished at 12-under.
	   Tom Watson, who entered the final round tied for the lead with
Tim Herron, carded a 72 and finished in a three-way tie for ninth
at 206. Herron was another two strokes back after a 74.
	   At the start of Monday's play, Mickelson was one stroke behind
the co-leaders, tied with Tom Lehman and Jay Haas. Haas shot a 70
and finished three shots off the pace, while Lehman, with a 71, was
another stroke back.
	   It took Mickelson only two days to recover from his collapse at
the PGA Championship.
	   Mickelson was just four strokes back heading into the third
round of the PGA Championship, but posted a 9-over 79 on Saturday
to fall out of the title chase.
	   He came back with a 67 on Sunday at Sahalee Country Club and
continued that strong play with a 5-under 67 on Monday at Pebble
Beach _ including a birdie on the final hole.
	   ``After Saturday's round at the PGA, I was disappointed with the
way I was playing, having put myself out of contention,'' Mickelson
said. ``I had to start seeing better shots, and I did that on
Sunday. I carried that with me today.''
	   Mickelson celebrated his Pebble Beach victory by hugging his
grandmother, who is in her mid-80s and walked all 18 holes with him
Monday.
	   The AT and T tournament chartered a plane to take players from
Seattle to Monterey on Sunday night. Those continuing to the next
tour stop, the International near Denver, got another chartered
flight Monday night.
	   Officials also had to do some last-minute scrambling to prepare
the course, which played host to a vintage car show on Sunday.
	   Pernice said finishing the tournament six months after it began
was the only fair thing to do. Two years ago, the entire AT and T
tournament was canceled because of lousy weather.
	   ``I think the tour did the right thing,'' he said. ``They tried
to do whatever they could to satisfy the people of Pebble Beach.
This is one of our special events.''

Moody's downgrades two Japanese electronics giants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Citing slumps in world chip prices and Japan's
economy, Moody's Investor Service cut its credit ratings of two of
Japan's biggest electronics makers, Hitachi Ltd. and Mitsubishi
Electric Corp.
	   The New York-based credit rating service said Monday it has
downgraded Hitachi's long-term debt rating to Aa3 from Aa2.
	   On the same day, it also cut Mitsubishi Electric's long and
short-term debt ratings to A3 from A2.
	   While reflecting concerns about future profitability, the new
ratings are still ``A'' and mean the companies remain relatively
safe investments.
	   Moody's said Mitsubishi should see earnings fall because it
``depends largely on memory products (i.e., computer chips) that
are suffering heavily from prolonged unit-price deterioration.''
	   Domestic sales of Hitachi's bread-and-butter mainframe computers
will likely fall due to the stagnant Japanese economy, Moody's
said.

	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Paul Byrd, signed only three days earlier,
outshined Randy Johnson with a four-hitter and also hit an RBI
single as the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Houston Astros 4-0
Monday night.
	   Johnson (3-1), coming off consecutive shutouts, left after the
fifth trailing 3-0. He allowed six hits and four walks, striking
out just three.
	   Byrd (1-0) had pitched only once in the majors this season,
making an ineffective relief appearance for Atlanta on April 19,
and was claimed on waivers last Friday after going 5-5 at Triple-A
Richmond. He did not permit a runner past first base, striking out
six and walking one in his first complete game in 88 career
appearances.

<TEXT>
	   KANSAS CITY, Missouri (AP) _ David Cone became the first 18-game
winner in the major leagues, and Tino Martinez, Tim Raines and
Bernie Williams homered Monday night to lead the New York Yankees
over the Kansas City Royals 7-1.
	   New York (91-30), on pace to break the 1906 Chicago Cubs' record
of 116 wins, is 9-0 against the Royals this year and has outscored
them 75-20. The Yankees, 61 over .500 for the first time since the
1939 club finished 106-45, has a 20-game lead, its largest since
they were 20 1-2 games ahead on Aug. 9, 1941.
	   Cone (18-4) allowed the one run and five hits in seven innings,
and Chili Davis returned from the disabled list with an RBI single
that made it 2-0 against Jose Rosado (6-9). Davis hadn't played
since the second game of the season.
 &UR; Orioles 3, Twins 2
	   In Baltimore, Scott Erickson (13-9) allowed two runs and seven
hits in seven innings and matched his career high with 10
strikeouts.
	   Harold Baines drove in two runs for the Orioles, who moved
within 6 1-2 games of Boston in the AL wild-card chase. Baltimore
trailed by 15 1-2 games at the All-Star break, but its 28-8 record
since that time is the best in the majors.
	   Jimmy Key pitched a perfect eighth and Armando Benitez got three
outs for his 18th save. LaTroy Hawkins (7-12) was the loser.
 &UR; Indians 4, Devil Rays 3
	   In Cleveland, rookie Richie Sexson was 3-for-4 with his first
major league homer and two RBIs as the Indians beat Wilson Alvarez
(5-12) and won for just the 18th time in 38 games since the
All-Star break.
	   Cecil Fielder, signed last Thursday, made his first start for
Cleveland and was 0-for-4. Manny Ramirez hit his 29th homer.
	   Bartolo Colon (13-6) allowed two runs and six hits in 6 2-3
innings, and Mike Jackson pitched the ninth for his 30th save,
throwing a called third strike past Quinton McCracken to end the
game with a runner on third.

Toyota Motor latest Japanese firm to admit ties with racketeers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest carmaker, said
Tuesday it has severed relations with suspected corporate
racketeers, adding its name to a growing list of prestigious firms
linked to the Japanese underworld.
	   Toyota's announcement came one day after police arrested a pair
of alleged ``sokaiya'' racketeers on suspicion of extorting 22.8
million yen (dlrs 155,000) from Japan Airlines Co.
	   ``In accordance with recommendations from the authorities last
spring, we have moved to end relations with firms associated with
sokaiya racketeers,'' Toyota said in a statement released early
Tuesday.
	   The automaker also said it had severed ties to Taihei Co., a
leasing company run by one of the two suspected underworld
operatives taken into custody on Monday.
	   No specifics on the extent of Toyota's relationship with Taihei
were available, said company spokeswoman Ririco Takeuchi.
	   A number of executives at top Japanese companies, including
Nomura Securities Co., Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and Mitsubishi
Motors Corp., were tainted last year in a broad probe of corporate
ties to professional racketeers.
	   Sokaiya specialize in extorting hush money from companies. They
usually threaten to disrupt annual company shareholders meetings by
disclosing embarrassing business decisions or other sensitive
information.
