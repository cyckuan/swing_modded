<HEADLINE> Gold Sale to Plunge South African Miners into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- South African mining chiefs
warned Wednesday that a million people in the country would be
plunged into misery if Britain continues selling its gold stocks.
</P>
<P>
The chiefs, beginning a three-day visit to London to challenge
Britain's bullion auction program, said they saw no reason why
Britain was rushing to sell its gold stocks, the South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the British sales would cause "atrocities" in
South Africa, the world's largest gold producer, and in
neighboring countries which provide 40 percent of the South
African mines' 230,000-strong workforce.
</P>
<P>
They listed the threat to 80,000 jobs in the industry if the
price stays the same, to another 20,000 jobs in related
industries, and the plight of neighboring countries such as
Mozambique and Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
South African government ministers are expected to join the
mining chiefs later in the week.
</P>
<P>
The visits were designed to "make the British public aware of
the British government decision".
</P>
<P>
South African mining association president Bobby Godsell and
union boss James Motlatsi denied that gold was losing its lustre
and called on the Bank of England to rethink its controversial
sales.
</P>
<P>
Godsell also cast doubt on the likelihood that the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) would proceed with its planned
sale of 300 tons of gold, designed to raise some two billion
dollars to fund debt relief for poor countries.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think they will go through with it, we don't think it
is a done deal," said Godsell, who is also president of the
Chamber of Mines which represents South Africa's major mining
houses. He was referring to impressions gained during a recent
trip to Washington.
</P>
<P>
The British and IMF selling plans have undermined gold prices
and driven them to 20-year low points. Gold was fixed on
Wednesday at 255.60 dollars an ounce in London. Last Tuesday's
British auction involved just 25 tons of gold, the first batch of
41 under the hammer in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Godsell, who is also chief executive of Anglogold, the world's
biggest gold-mining company, questioned what "burning imperative"
has forced Britain to sell now.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair told the British parliament
that the sale was planned "on technical advice", saying "it is
entirely sensible to have reserves in a broader portfolio."
</P>
<P>
Godsell said that the U.S. Federal Reserve, the German
Bundesbank, and the Italian and French central banks had all
refused to sell gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
"The bank which is out of line is the Bank of England," Godsell
told a press briefing to kick off the visit.
</P>
<P>
The mining chiefs will try to meet politicians, trade unions,
businesses, and civil and religious groups.
</P>
<P>
"If there is no burning imperative, I would hope that they
could stop and think again," Godsell said of the Bank of England.

<HEADLINE> UAE Economy to Grow by 2.6 Percent in 1999: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
is expected to realize an economic growth of 2.6 percent in 1999,
and the growth rate might rise to 3.4 percent in the year 2000,
according to a report issued Wednesday by the Abu Dhabi Crown
Prince's Court.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated at 50.4
billion U.S. dollars in 1999, 5.2 percent higher than the figure
last year. Its GDP will further rise to 53.4 billion dollars in
2000, says the 240-page report, which contains information on
economic and social development in the country.
</P>
<P>
The report predicts the country's per capita income to reach
17,100 dollars this year and 17,200 dollars in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The country's revenues will increase this year to 14.4 billion
dollars, of which 9.6 billion are oil revenues. Its general
expenditure is expected to be around 21.4 billion dollars to
constitute a deficit of 7 billion dollars or 14 percent of the
GDP, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It anticipates a trade surplus of 6.1 billion dollars in 1999
as exports are expected to reach 36.4 billion dollars, while
imports are projected to reach 30.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
The surplus, according to the report, is expected to rise to 7
billion dollars in 2000 as exports will increase to 39.4 billion
dollars and imports to 32.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the UAE's inflation rate will slightly
rise by 4.5 percent by the end of 1999 and remain steady in the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The dollar-pegged dirham's exchange rate will remain at 3.67
against the dollar in 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
The UAE's population will reach 2.9 million in 1999, an
increase of 6.5 percent over 1998. The population will rise to
3.48 million in 2005 at an annual growth rate of 2.9 percent, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Foreign Minister to Visit Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem will pay a visit to Kosovo on Saturday to tour the areas where
Turkish peace-keeping forces are deployed, Turkish sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish troops have been deployed in the sector of Kosovo
allocated to the united States' surveillance.
</P>
<P>
Cem will also meet with representatives of the 20,000-strong
Kosovar Turkish community which is concentrated in Pristina and
Prizren.
</P>
<P>
As a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
Turkey dispatched 11 F-16 fighter jets to participate in the
March-June NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Cem will also make efforts in soothing the ongoing tension
between Kosovo's Albanian majority and the Turkish community that
faces accusations of siding with the Serbs during the war, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister's trip is a reflection of the active role
Turkey is seeking in post-war Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Turkey plans to open two offices in Pristina and Prizren in the
province, where near 1,000-strong Turkish troops have been
deployed.
</P>
<P>
The initial task of the offices will coordinate the
distribution of the humanitarian aid that Turkey will provide for
the Kosovoars under the auspices of the Turkish Red
Crescent.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Continues Peace Effort on DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
 discussed Tuesday night in Algeria with regional leaders on how
to implement the ceasefire agreement signed here last Saturday to
end the 11- month conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe,
DRC President Laurent Kabila and Namibian President Sam Nujoma as
well as foreign ministers of Angola, Rwanda and Uganda, whose
countries signed the ceasefire agreement, according to Zambia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
No details of the meeting have been disclosed but sources said
the discussion was focused on how to work out a mechanism to make
the rebel forces fighting to topple Kabila sign the peace
agreement quickly.
</P>
<P>
The discussion was held in Algiers, capital of Algeria, where
the three-day 35th summit of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) was held starting from Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels did not sign the agreement because of the
disagreement over who will sign the deal on behalf of the rebel
Rally for Democracy in Congo (RDC).
</P>
<P>
RDC split into two factions in May -- one led by Emile Ilunga
and the other by Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba.
</P>
<P>
The group led by Ilunga is firmly opposed to Wamba's signing of
the agreement but Wamba's stand is that the two factions should
both sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
In order to continue the process, none of the rebel groups
including the Movement for the Liberation of the Congo (MLC) led
by Jean-Pierre Bemba signed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who has been mandated by the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to mediate a peaceful solution to the
war in the vast central African country, will help them resolve
the internal issue so that the rebels can sign the agreement
later.
</P>
<P>
The three rebel groups have said that they will not be bound by
the agreement because they did not sign it.
</P>
<P>
Bemba said Wednesday that his forces have been fighting with
the government forces every day since the ceasefire agreement was
signed.
</P>
<P>
Kabila also said in a radio interview Tuesday that the war is
continuing but he added that he is confident that peace will
eventually take hold.

<HEADLINE> UK, Top Destination For Investment In Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain remains the top destination
for foreign investment in Europe in the past year despite the
strong pound, financial crisis in Asia and its decision to stay
out of euro now.
</P>
<P>
More than 650 new projects were announced Wednesday in Britain
Bureau's Annual Review of Operation 1999, and the UK's global
investment stock now stands at 196 billion pounds, an increase of
30 percent on the 1998 figure.
</P>
<P>

44,000 new jobs, with the knock-on effect of another 118,000 in
associated businesses.
</P>
<P>
The key sectors were software, telecommunications and the car
industry. Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers said at the
launch of the Review, this showed that the UK was developing a
high-tech character which attracted leading edge investors.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on this achievement, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
said, "Investment from overseas creates British jobs, revitalizes
regional economies and fuels British prosperity."
</P>
<P>
"Persuading foreign investors to come to Britain ensures we
stay competitive in the global economy," Cook added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Annan Not to Abandon Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Wednesday left Algeria for a visit to Slovakia, winding up
his six-nation Africa tour at a time when African leaders and
people are groping for ways to end armed conflict and promote
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Beginning July 6, the trip, which took him to Senegal, Sierra
Leone, Liberia, Guinea, Nigeria and Algeria, has sent a strong
message to the world: the United Nations is not giving up Africa
although the Organization has met with its peacekeeping failure in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
Annan started the trip against a backdrop of speculations that
the United Nations would abandon Africa after it shut down the
decade-old peacekeeping operations and complaints from some
African countries that African conflicts were overshadowed at the
world body by the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
The visit came on heels of the signing of peace accords for
Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), although
rebels have so far refused to sign the latter deal. More
encouraging signs were the second successful post-apartheid
elections in South Africa, the African economic power, and smooth
transition to civilian rule in Nigeria, Africa's most populous
country.
</P>
<P>
"The overall picture in Africa today is nowhere near as gloomy
as it seems to those elsewhere," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, deadly conflicts persist: in Angola,
in the DRC, and between Ethiopia and Eritrea. Along with conflict,
in the past year the world also witnessed, in the Comoros,
Guinea-Bissau and Niger, new examples of a problem emerged -- the
duly-elected governments were overthrown by force.
</P>
<P>
Annan "is very concerned that the many crises in Africa give
the whole continent a bad name," said U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard,
who is with the U.N. chief on his Africa and Europe tour.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Africa, Annan, a Ghanaian, also attended the
Organization of Africa Unity (OAU) summit, the century's last
session, in Algeria, which offered him good opportunities to talk
with OAU and African leaders on how to bring an end to on-going
conflicts and boost economic advancement on the war-torn
continent.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations will continue to do what we can to bring
about an end to those hostilities," Annan told African leaders.
"The development of Africa has always been one of the United
Nations prime concerns, and with good reason: healthy development
is the best long-term conflict prevention we know."
</P>
<P>
Annan, the first black African who heads the 185-nation world
body, presented what was termed as a comprehensive report to the
Security Council, in April last year, shedding more light on the
causes and effects of African conflicts, and how to promote
economic growth in the war-ravaged Africa.
</P>
<P>
Annan has called upon African countries to refrain from weapons
purchase in order to save more money for development, and appealed
to Western countries for a quick debt relief and more investment.
</P>
<P>
With Annan at the helm, the United Nations is undertaking more
efforts to help Africa out of conflicts and poverty, and back on
the tracks to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In Western Sahara, United Nations officials are continuing
their efforts to arrange a referendum. And in the Central African
Republic, the United Nations has mounted a multi-dimensional
peacekeeping operation responsible for organizing elections,
disarmament and other things.
</P>
<P>
Annan will dispatch three U.N. officials to Lusaka, capital of
Zambia, to persuade DRC rebels to sign the peace accord, a U.N.
spokesman announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Annan has led the United Nations, including the Security
Council, in rendering pains-taking efforts to beef up
conflict-preventing and peacekeeping capacities in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation Security Council is expected to discuss the U.N.
peacekeeping presence in the DRC after rebels sign the peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
During Annan's Africa visit, "he has met with African leaders
he wants to contact, and he went to see refugees in a first-hand
way, in order to see what he can do from his position as the
Secretary-General to help Africa," Manoel de Almeida e Silva, the
U.N. spokesman, told Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> France to Increase Oil Import From Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Due to upward trend in crude prices
on the international market, France has decided to increase its
oil import from Angola starting from this year, which is believed
to improve the trade balance between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Robert Igier, economic counsellor of the French embassy in
Angola, said here Wednesday that 99 percent of the country's
import of oil products form Angola will be crude oil.
</P>
<P>
France's export to Angola accounts for 93 percent of the total
volume of bilateral trade. About 70 percent of the export are
industrial equipment, whereas 23 percent are agricultural
products, said Igier.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the bilateral trade has been in favor of France,
at 116 million U.S. dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
France has been the third largest product supplier to Angola
traditionally, but last year its position was challenged by South
Africa. Meanwhile, Angola has been France's second largest trade
partner in southern Africa, after South Africa.
</P>
<P>
France and Angola have just signed several big-sum agreements
on oil exploitation, therefore the French official feels
optimistic about the prospects of bilateral trade in the coming
years.

JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The South African embassy in
Algiers, Algeria, was officially opened by Foreign Minister
Nkosazana Zuma Wednesday, according to the South African Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"Algeria's invaluable contribution to the struggle for freedom
in South Africa has paved the way for close cooperation between
our two countries," Zuma was quoted by a ministry statement as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the long-standing ties between the two countries, she
said that it was now important to turn the political goodwill into
concrete benefits for the people of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Zuma also recalled that Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika, in his then capacity as president of the United
Nations General Assembly, was instrumental in expelling the South
African apartheid regime from the world body in 1974.
</P>
<P>
This historical event had set the course for all South Africans

</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the bilateral commission established
between the two countries in 1995 had formed a solid foundation
for greater economic cooperation.

PARIS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
promised Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Wednesday that France
would bring him all his support in the search for peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Barak, Chirac said that "some
changes have already taken place" since the new prime minister
came to power, according to presidential spokeswoman Catherine
Colonna.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also said that to re-establish a "strong and confiding
relationship" with Israel is one of his priorities, and he invited
Barak to visit France at a time of his convenience.
</P>
<P>
Barak, who called Chirac before he began a visit to the United
States Wednesday, said that he is determined to go ahead in the
peace process, said the French presidential spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
Relations between France and Israel remained strained during
the rule of former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
because of differences over Israel's policy toward the
Palestinians, Israel's construction of Jewish settlements as well
as the status of the eastern part of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
France was also critical of Israel's occupation of southern
Lebanon and condemned Israel's air raids against Lebanon last

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Urged to Attract Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government should
create an enabling environment to help the country to attract much
needed foreign investment, a high-ranking official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pat Rooney, chairman of industrial task force of the National
Economic Consultative Forum, said the country was in need of
foreign currency inflows when presenting a paper on industrial
development into the new millenium at the opening of a three-day
confederation of Zimbabwe Industries Congress.
</P>
<P>
"There is need for a concerted effort between the government
and the private sector to improve the negative image the country
is facing if our industries are to successfully contribute to the
stabilization of the economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's economy was characterized by high interest rates,
lack of local investment, declining exports, minimal direct
foreign investment and static employment.
</P>
<P>
Rooney said one of the task force's objective was to attain an
industrial growth rate of 2.5 percent of the projected gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
"This goal can only be achieved if the environment is conducive
to investors," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged local companies to improve their managerial and
technical skills to make sure that their products were competitive
both on regional and global markets.
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe has the potential of being the most competitive
country in the southern African region," he said, adding, "as a
result we need to increase our development programs so that we can
keep up with international standards."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the balance of payments support of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would help stabilize the
economy within the next six to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
"Although we welcome the IMF monetary support, industrialists
should start looking at the future and work toward
self-sufficiency for the long- term benefits," he said.

<P>
HARARE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's July year-on-year
inflation reached a new record high of 55.2 percent, gaining 2.2
percentage points on the June rate of 53 percent, the Central
Statistical Office (CSO) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The month-on-month rate of inflation for June was 1.9 percent,
gaining 0. 5 percentage points on the May rate of 1.4 percent,
which means the prices as measured by the all items consumer price
index increased by an average of 1. 9 percent from May, 1999 to
June 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistical Office said purchasing power had gone
down such that a dollar today was equivalent to 10.2 cents in
1990.
</P>
<P>
"The headline inflation of 55.2 percent is an all time high,"
said the office, adding "it comes at a time when recent maize
meal price increases to be completely factored into the consumer
price index for the month ending July, is likely to increase
inflation further," said the office.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Protests Against Remarks by Turkish PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry on
Wednesday summoned Turkish Charge D'affaires to Tehran Kut Sezgin
to protest the remarks of Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit on
the recent unrest in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Head of the ministry's mass media department termed Ecevit's
remarks as "irresponsible" and "against the principle of good
neighborliness," the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said on Tuesday the current violent unrest in Iran is a
result of an "oppressive and outdated" Islamic regime and the
Iranian people cannot be expected to endure it for a long period.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official requested Sezgin to offer explanation on
the issue and inform senior Turkish officials of Iran's protest.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin said Ankara is interested in strengthening its ties with
Tehran and he will inform his government of Iran's protest.
</P>
<P>
During the past week, Iran experienced the worst unrest
since the 1979 Islamic revolution as security forces clashed
with protesting students following an unauthorized police
crackdown on the Tehran University dormitory complex on Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
The police assault, a response to a student rally protesting
the approval of a new press law and the closure of the leading
moderate daily Salam (Hello), has been widely condemned in the
Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a massive rally on Wednesday, Secretary of the
Iranian Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) Hassan Rowhani
also warned foreign countries against voicing support for the
unrest in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
"Speeches made by certain countries about the events of the
past several days will be recorded in our files," said
Rowhani, also Vice Majlis (parliament) speaker.
</P>
<P>
"We will give them an appropriate answer at the opportune
time," he added.

<HEADLINE> Ethio-Eritrean Conflict Spills Over to Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Large convoys of Ethiopian
troops have been seen crossing the border with Somalia, chasing
the Oromo-ethnic militiamen opposing to the Ethiopian government,
reports reaching here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that three convoys of Ethiopian troops,
estimated at over 5,000 carrying heavy military hardware, passed
through several towns and villages in Gedo and Bay regions in the
past two days.
</P>
<P>
According to civilians arriving from Gedo Wednesday, the
Ethiopian troops who are being accompanied by some Somalis are
trying to capture the tarmac airport of Ballidogleh controlled by
faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopians are also reportedly trying to attack Qoryoley
town which has been the site chosen by Aidid for military base for
the Oromo soldiers fighting against Prime Minister Meles Zenawi's
administration in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
There has been no single resistance reported against the
Ethiopian convoys in any of those towns or villages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Somali National Front faction which dominates
Gedo region has also confirmed the new Ethiopian soldiers moving
deeply into Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the faction, Ibrahim Juama Howleh, said that his
faction is ready to open dialogue with Ethiopia and settle their
differences peacefully.
</P>
<P>
There is no immediate comment on the developments from the
Ethiopian government.
</P>
<P>
Both Ethiopia and Eritrea are allegedly supplying weapons,
ammunition and even soldiers to some Somali factions with the aim
of undermining the other's power.
</P>
<P>
The two Horn of Africa neighbors resorted to arms over a
disputed part of border in early last May. Despite efforts made
by the international community, there is in sight no immediate end
to the conflict between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> 3 Iraqi Civilians Injured in Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Three Iraqi civilians were
injured on Wednesday in U.S. and British warplanes bombardment of
some civilian and military targets, an Iraqi military spokesman
announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying
that at 10:35 (0635 GMT) eight formations of enemy warplanes
coming from Turkish airspace violated northern Iraqi airspace over
Dohuk, Erbil and Neineva provinces.
</P>
<P>
These enemy warplanes bombed some civilian installations in
the area, leading to the injuries of three civilians, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraqi air defenses fired back and forced the
enemy planes to flee to their base in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that since the U.S. and Britain launched
airstrikes against Iraq last December, their warplanes have made
9,994 sorties over the no-fly zones in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in
Iraq in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim
of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims
in the south from possible attacks by the Iraqi government
troops.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's bombardment of Iraq, U.S. and British
warplanes have been regularly attacking Iraqi civilian and
military targets, causing severe civilian casualties and property
damages.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Africa Striving for Peace, Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- African leaders gathered here on
July 12-14 with a new openness and pragmatism to scrutinize the
daunting challenges facing the continent at the turn of the
millenium and try to map out a blueprint for the future.
</P>
<P>
Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflica, the host of the
meeting, called the largest ever gathering of African leaders as a
new start for the continent.
</P>
<P>
The 46 heads of state and government, who participated in the
35th summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), shared
unanimous views that peace and development are, more than ever,
two things that Africans have been yearning for.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo called on leaders of
African countries in his keynote address at the summit to make
"2000 a year of peace and security in Africa," saying "Africa's
reputation as a continent at war against itself must be arrested."
</P>
<P>
The leaders fervently believe that Africa is in dire need of
peace, a prerequisite for healthy and sustainable development.
Without peace, development would be nothing but a dream and Africa
would continue to be marginalized and eventually swallowed by the
increasingly high wave of globalization.
</P>
<P>
At a time when peace and development have constituted the
mainstream of the world, many parts of Africa are still
experiencing the scourge of domestic upheavals, border conflicts
and regional wars.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said: "If the 1980s was Africa's lost decade
economically, the 1990s has turned out to be the decade when
conflicts have reached an ominous proportion."
</P>
<P>
More than 30 conflicts have taken place in the poor continent
since 1970s and at least 14 African countries are still directly
or indirectly embroidered in ravaging wars.
</P>
<P>
The civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo made the
fragile peace process in the Great Lakes region more shaky.
</P>
<P>
The on-and-off war in the Horn of Africa cost so many innocent
lives and inflicted unbearable suffering to people there.
</P>
<P>
Constant conflicts have not only posed a colossal threat to the
 continent's stability, but also driven millions of people
homeless and local economies stagnated.
</P>
<P>
Driven by wars slipping out of control bit by bit, some African
 governments have to dump their hard-earned scanty foreign
exchange into the bottomless abysses of war and even run the risk
of killing their faltering economies.
</P>
<P>
Africa is already trudging under a staggering burden of a
350-billion- dollar foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
What is more, the figure is growing at a surprisingly high rate
of 23 percent each year, making it a sure thing that any more
burden, however small it is,

would crush the backbones of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Faced with these daunting challenges, African leaders stand up
to embrace them and try to restore peace in the war-torn
continent.
</P>
<P>
With their own efforts and collective wisdom, they struck out
peace deals to end the year-long wars both in the Democratic
Republic of Congo and Sierra Leone by bringing the warring parties
to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
The warring sides of the Sudan civil war have agreed to meet in
Nairobi later this month, and the OAU summit has persuaded
belligerent Ethiopia and Eritrea to renew their peace talks.
</P>
<P>
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata told reporters
at the sidelines of the summit, "I think that there is genuine
attempt to share problems and see what they can do with each other
about solving them."
</P>
<P>
The African heads of state, who are highly praised by diplomats
and observers for their openness and pragmatism, have decided to
get down to analyze various causes of war and get rid of them so
that the continent could strive for a quick recovery and an even
economic take-off.
</P>
<P>
Peace is the precondition to development and development
guarantees peace. At the summit, the statesmen also decided to
further strengthen economic cooperation between member states and
hasten the pace of the establishment of African Economic
Community.
</P>
<P>
They realized that to enhance the competitiveness of African
economy in the world, the only way out is to reverse the growing
trend of Africa's marginalization in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit has ended with a declaration pressing for
peace and development, the conspicuous theme of this epoch-making
gathering of African leaders.
</P>
<P>
With newly set goals in mind, the leaders will work tirelessly
for the bright future looming ahead and make Africa better
prepared for the new millennium.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President to Visit Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin William
Mkapa on Thursday starts a three-day official visit to Egypt,
Tanzanian ambassador in Cairo Muhamed Mwinyi Mzale said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mzale told Egypt's Middle East News Agency that Mkapa's visit
is aimed at fostering bilateral relations in all domains,
especially in the economic and trade areas, Mzale said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the visit will afford "a good opportunity" to
the two leaders to take up issues on the bilateral ties,
particularly to activate the Tanzanian-Egyptian Joint Committee
formed in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian diplomat asserted that the two countries enjoy
historical cooperations and share views on regional and
international issues.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa will reiterate support for Mubarak's efforts to bring
peace to the Middle East and Africa, Mzale said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was the first Arab country to make peace with Israel by
signing a peace treaty in 1979. It has played a key role in
mediating the Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Cairo is also keen on seeking solutions to the conflicts on the
African continent, including the civil war in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, the border disputes between Eritrea and
Ethiopia and the civil war in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Mkapa is expected to meet with Egyptian
businessmen in a bid to allure them to invest in Tanzania and
promote bilateral trade, the Tanzanian ambassador said.

<HEADLINE> 071450   Concerted Efforts Urged for Peace in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- African countries were urged here
Wednesday to make concerted efforts to establish stable state
institutions to promote the use of peaceful means in solving
conflicts on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in the Algiers Declaration issued at the
end of the 35th summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
which was seen as a historical meeting for the continent at the
turn of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
While hailing the passing 20th century as a century that has
been brought to a successful conclusion through decolonizing the
continent, the declaration reaffirmed the determination of African
leaders to solve conflicts in conformity with the principles of
sovereign equality, non- interference, non-resort to threats or
the use of force.
</P>
<P>
The safeguarding of independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of each state, treasured as the source of power at the
founding of OAU back in 1963, were also reaffirmed as basic
principles of the continental bloc.
</P>
<P>
The OAU mechanism for conflict prevention, management and
resolution was taken as a "valuable asset" for Africa, said the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
While praising the contributions of the founding fathers for
the decolonization of the continent, the declaration said OAU has
played an irreplaceable role in the affirmation of political
identity and the realization of unity for Africa.
</P>
<P>
It called on Africans to continue to make OAU a vital
instrument of Africa's collective action both within the continent
and in their relations with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The achievement in winning freedom and independence, the
declaration said, constitutes for Africans a source of profound
and legitimate pride.
</P>
<P>
Despite the hopes generated by the end of the Cold War, the OAU
document said, African leaders find that post-Cold War era is
fraught with "new and grave uncertainties, serious risks of
marginalization and new challenges that pose numerous threats to
the continent."
</P>
<P>
Globalization, the elimination of weapons of mass destruction,
terrorism, among others, were listed as the challenges facing
Africa in the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Ban On British Beef Exports Lifted Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission Wednesday
announced the decision to lift a three-year ban on British beef
exports from August 1.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU)'s executive said the decision was made
under the Date Based Export Scheme (DBES), which applies only to
deboned meat and meat products obtained from animals born after
August 1, 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the DBES, the animals slaughtered must be over six
months and under 30 months of age.
</P>
<P>
The scheme also includes the slaughter and destruction of
offspring from Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) affected
cows. And verification that the dam of the animal concerned has
been alive six months after birth and not developed BSE, known as
mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The application of a BSE test under the DBES is not considered
as it would serve no useful purpose, the European Commission said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The decision is expected to end a worldwide embargo on British
beef sales which is said to have cost the farming industry about
2 billion U.S. dollars in lost sales.

<P>
BEIRUT, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Human rights groups and unions
across Lebanon Wednesday held various activities to mark the
Lebanese Prisoners' Day.
</P>
<P>
The day was set on July 14, 1983 when Israel established the
first jail in south Lebanon to hold Lebanese who were accused of
involving in actions against Israeli forces in the region.

<HEADLINE> First Arab-Israeli Appointed to Sensitive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in Israel's
51-year history, an Arab-Israeli legislator was appointed
Wednesday to sit on the semi-secret Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee of the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
The United Arab List, one of the three Arab parties in the
Knesset, chose its member Hashem Mahameed to the prestigious
committee which oversees national security and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
Dovish Justice Minister Yossi Beilin called the appointment of
Mahameed a "historic event" and another step toward making the
Arab community a legitimate part of the Israeli society.
</P>
<P>
Arabs make up about 18 percent of Israel's 6 million
population, but they feel discriminated in almost every field
because of the Israeli-Arab conflict.
</P>
<P>
In the May 17 prime ministerial election, the Arab electorate
voted almost unanimously for Ehud Barak, who has promised to
improve the situation of the Arab society and ensure their right
of equality.
</P>
<P>
But when forming his broad-based coalition government, Barak
failed to break the half-century taboo in Israel that excludes
Arab from the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
After Mahameed's appointment, the right-wing Likud announced
that it would submit a no-confidence motion against the government
and would boycott the work of the committee.
</P>
<P>
At an emergency news conference, former Likud defense minister
Moshe Arens said Mahameed should not sit on the sensitive
committee because he is not interested in Israel's security,
citing his anti-defense establishment attitude and sympathy for
the Islamic militant group Hamas.
</P>
<P>
Likud member Uzi Landau, former chairman of the committee,
accused Barak of currying favor with the Arabs at the expense of
Israel's national security.
</P>
<P>
Mahameed dismissed all these allegation, saying he has the
right to be on the committee.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Assembly Ordered to Convene Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The British Government Wednesday
issued an order for a new Northern Ireland assembly to convene
Thursday in Belfast, thus formally setting in progress the next
major step in the Good Friday peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam has directed the assembly
to meet tomorrow morning at 10.30 a.m. Thursday," a Reuters
reported quoted a spokesman for her office as saying.
</P>
<P>
The go-ahead for the all-party assembly to meet was given while
negotiations were still going on to convince Protestant
politicians they should take part in the devolution of power from
London to the new Belfast government which would include
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
Protestant politicians are meeting later Wednesday to decide if
they can take part in the assembly and accept a deal by Britain
and Ireland to implement the so-called Good Friday peace plan
despite a row over guerrilla disarmament by the Irish Republican
Army (IRA), according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
One of the scheduled first orders of business for the
108-member assembly would be the appointment of ministers.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace deal, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) of First
Minister David Trimble would get three posts, the moderate
Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP) would get three,
the hardline Protestant Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) would get
two and Sinn Fein, political ally of the IRA, would get two posts.

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Sets New High With Dipping U.S. Inventories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- World oil markets stampeded to
another high Wednesday amid fresh evidence from the United States
that OPEC export limits are swiftly erasing excess petroleum
stockpiles in the West.
</P>
<P>
London August futures for benchmark Brent crude traded to a
20-month peak of 19.43 a barrel following a weekly American
Petroleum Institute report on U.S. oil inventories.
</P>
<P>
But Brent shed some gains, trading two cents up on the day at
19.05 U.S. dollars as speculators pocketed profits from a five
U.S. dollar rally over the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
The API said U.S. gasoline and crude oil stocks declined
further than expected in the week to July 9 and confirmed that
U.S. demand was growing faster than previously projected.
</P>
<P>
"Further upside impetus has been seen with the API report again
on the positive side," Reuters quoted Lawrence Eagles of brokers
GNI as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said oil's latest surge had been underpinned by the
perception that OPEC exporters will maintain a tight rein on
supplies, despite fears that the market might overheat.

<HEADLINE> Globalization Challenges Africa: OAU Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Globalization is the "most
widespread challenge" Africa is facing in the new millennium,
according to the Algiers Declaration issued here Wednesday at the
closing of the 35th summit of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU).
</P>
<P>
The declaration said globalization has aroused fears that it
may pose serious threats to the sovereignty, cultural and
historical identities and gravely undermines the prospect of
development for Africa.
</P>
<P>
Globalization should be placed within the framework of a
democratically conceived dynamics, and implemented "collectively
to make it an institution capable of fulfilling the hope for a
concerted development of mankind and prosperity shared by all
peoples," the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The growing marginalization of the United Nations and its role
for the maintenance of international peace and security and the
promotion of international cooperation for development, is the
challenge second only to globalization for Africa.
</P>
<P>
African heads of state and government agreed that the
unilateral use of force in international relations, outside the
duly conferred mandate of the U.N. Security Council, opens the way
to practices inimical to world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
They also called for respect toward U.N. role and
responsibilities in the maintenance of international peace and
security.
</P>
<P>
For this end, said the declaration, a genuine democratization
of international relations based on the active participation and a
balanced consideration of the legitimate concerns of all nations
should be in place in the world.
</P>
<P>
It stressed the need for democratization equally applied to
other international institutions including, particularly, the
International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear disarmament, and the elimination of other weapons of
mass destruction, terrorism, drug trafficking and organized crimes
were listed as other challenges facing the continent.
</P>
<P>
The final document of the 35th OAU summit urged the continent
to enter the third millennium with a genuine spirit of
cooperation, restored human dignity and a common hope in an
inter-dependent future for mankind.

<HEADLINE> Blair Agrees to Change N. Ireland Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
announced Wednesday that his government is to table amendments to
the Northern Ireland Bill in a bid to meet Unionist and opposition
Conservative concerns.
</P>
<P>
"We will table amendments in line with the Good Friday
Agreement," Blair told parliament a few hours before the Ulster
Unionist Party executive was to meet in Belfast to give its
verdict on the plan.
</P>
<P>
Blair said that the amendments would ensure that the
decommissioning of paramilitary weapons happened in accordance
with a strict timetable.
</P>
<P>
The changes would also allow for the formal identification of
any parties that defaulted in the process and for the suspension
of the institutions set up by Northern Irish devolution.
</P>
<P>
Blair indicated he was still hoping the unionists, deeply
suspicious of the proposals, would agree in time for a devolved
government to be set up in Belfast later this week.
</P>
<P>
The emergency legislation to save the Northern Irish peace
process, passed by Britain's House of Commons early Wednesday, is
being debated in the House of Lords.

<HEADLINE> New Snag in Anelka Saga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League football
club Arsenal striker Nicolas Anelka's move to Lazio has reportedly
hit further problems, with the two clubs apparently having six
million apart in their valuations.
</P>
<P>
A report claims that the Italians have refused to meet Arsenal'
s 26 million pounds valuation of the Frenchman.
</P>
<P>
The European Cup Winners' Cup holders have supposedly offered
the Gunners 15 percent of his value when he is next sold.
</P>
<P>
Juventus have reportedly offered nearly 32 million in cash and
players for the 20-year-old striker.
</P>
<P>
Anelka has threatened legal and strike action if his demands -
to transfer to Lazio for next season - are not met.
</P>
<P>
"I will start legal proceedings against Juventus, I will ask
for damages," Anelka told the Italian newspaper Corriere dello
Sport.
</P>
<P>
"They're interfering with my career. Instead of withdrawing
their offer to Arsenal, as I asked them to in a letter, they've
presented another offer, even higher than the first."
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman is also willing to take his case to the European
Court, citing European Union labour legislation which could enable
him to buy out his contract with Arsenal at minimal cost.
</P>
<P>
Contacts have already been made with Jean Louis Dupont, the
lawyer who represented Belgian footballer Jean-Marc Bosman in his
landmark case against European football rules in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Anelka is also prepared to organise a kind of informal boycott
against the Turin club, warning off other players from joining
them.
</P>
<P>
"I'm prepared to do anything," he said. "Even if that meant not
playing for two months or six, or a whole year, or even longer."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Fall 0.1 percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department said
Wednesday that wholesale prices dropped 0.1 percent in June, the
first decline in four months, due to the falling prices for
gasoline and cars.
</P>
<P>
The June decline in the Producer Price Index followed a 0.2
percent increase in May and was the first decline since a 0.5
percent plunge in February.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the moderation in wholesale prices, if matched at
the retail level, will likely boost the confidence of Fed
officials that they do not need to move quickly to raise interest
rates and slow economic growth.
</P>
<P>
During the first six months of this year, wholesale prices have
been increasing at an annual rate of 1.5 percent. But wholesale
prices had shown no increase at all for all of 1998, because that
good performance reflected the impacts of the global financial
crisis, which depressed demand and prices for many commodities
including oil.
</P>
<P>
For the first six months of this year, energy prices rose at an
annual rate of 13.5 percent, a sharp turnaround from a 9.1 percent
rate of decline in the final six months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In both May and June, energy prices moderated after a huge, 5.1
percent spurt in April. Energy prices dipped 0.3 percent in June,
reflecting a 1.9 percent fall in gasoline prices. Gasoline costs
had been down an even bigger 2.7 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
While rising demand during the summer driving season has pushed
gasoline pump prices back up in recent weeks, analysts said they
were not looking for further huge increases in the months ahead as
supplies should remain plentiful.
</P>
<P>
June's food costs were up 0.4 percent at the wholesale level, a
slight moderation after a 0.5 percent rise in May. Beef prices
soared 8.2 percent last month, the biggest one-month jump since an
8.8 percent increase in October 1985.
</P>
<P>
But the big increase in beef was offset somewhat by a 5.2
percent decline in pork prices, the biggest decrease in this
category in 11 months. Vegetable prices were up 14.5 percent with
the gains led by big jumps in the price of cauliflower, tomatoes,
broccoli and celery.
</P>
<P>
Outside the volatile food and energy sectors, the so-called
core rate of inflation at the wholesale level fell 0.2 percent in
June, the first decline since 0.2 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the core rate of inflation reflected a big, 1.3
percent fall in the price of passenger cars, the biggest reversal
since January's 1.4 percent dip, and a 0.7 percent decline in the
category that includes sport utility vehicles.

<HEADLINE> The Netherlands Backs EU Decision on Balkan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands' Deputy Foreign
Minister Birkan Benschop said here Wednesday that his country
supported the decision by the European Union (EU) leaders to base
its agency for the reconstruction of the Balkans in the northern
Greek city of Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
Benschop made the remarks after talks here with his Greek
counterpart, Yiannos Kranidiotis.
</P>
<P>
The EU decision for Thessaloniki as the seat for the Balkans
reconstruction service must be implemented, he said, adding that
the port of Thessaloniki was not only a port of hope, but a port
of reconstruction for the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Thessaloniki, the largest city in northern Greece, was chosen
as the headquarters for the EU's agency for the reconstruction of
the Balkans when EU leaders met later June in Rio de Janeiro on
the sidelines of an EU summit with Latin American countries, but
some EU members are now trying to move the agency to Pristina,
capital of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Benschop said that Dutch companies were interested in forming
joint ventures with Greek companies on projects involved in
reconstructing the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Dutch companies could provide know-how and telecoms and
construction experience, he added.
</P>
<P>
Benschop welcomed the resumption of negotiations between Greece
and Turkey, saying that this would contribute to improved dialogue
between the EU and Turkey.

<HEADLINE> UAE, Venezuela Reiterate Need to Observe Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
and Venezuela Wednesday reiterated the need for all members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to abide by
their production quotas to protect oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also reiterated the need for continuous
cooperation between OPEC members and non-OPEC countries to ensure
better oil prices, the official WAM news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that UAE Minister of Petroleum and Mineral
Resources Obeid Bin Saif Al Nasir had met with a senior
Venezuelan delegation here.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, comprising senior officials from the Venezuelan
Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Energy and Mines, arrived here on
Tuesday as part of the tour of OPEC member countries to drum up
support for Venezuela's efforts to host an OPEC summit next
February.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the two sides also expressed their
satisfaction with the improving oil prices, which had hit 18
U.S. dollars per barrel, the highest in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Alfaro Silva, director general of the Venezuelan energy and
mineral resources, denied the claim that his country was reneguing
on its quota to flood the oil market.
</P>
<P>
When asked about his country's choice on the contest for the
seat of the OPEC secretary-general between Saudi Arabia and Iran,
Silva said his country was still studying the issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the delegation delivered a message from Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez to UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al
Nahyan, inviting him attend the possible OPEC summit next year,
WAM said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also promised to open embassies in each
other's capitals to further develop relations.

<P>
BRUSSELS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A Belgian public prosecutor has
shot himself to death, said local media reports Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor was responsible for investigating Belgium's
paedophile scandal and the murder of a former Socialist Party
patriarch committed suicide Tuesday, according to local TV and
radio reports.
</P>
<P>
Hubert Massa, 54, was in charge of investigations into the
deaths of four young girls seized by convicted paedophile Marc
Dutroux and the mafia-like murder in 1991 of the French-speaking
Socialist Party leader Andre Cools.
</P>
<P>
The probe into Cools' killing uncovered a bribes-for-contracts
scandal which triggered the resignation of the then NATO secretary
general, Belgium's former Deputy Prime Minister Willy Claes.
</P>
<P>
Massa's officemates gave no motive for his suicide, the media
reports said. And investigation into the suicide is expected to be
launched soon.

<HEADLINE> La Nina to Continue Through Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The current La Nina climate
episode will last through the winter, U.S. government researchers
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration's National Centers for Environmental Prediction
said that while La Nina's strength has diminished from last
winter, it will continue to influence weather around the United
States.
</P>
<P>
That means continued dry conditions along the U.S. East Coast
-- except for areas affected by more frequent hurricanes -- and
continued wet weather in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
La Nina is characterized by unusually cold sea-surface
temperatures in the eastern and central equatorial Pacific, which
trigger atmospheric patterns that influence weather around the
world.
</P>
<P>
For the Pacific Northwest, that means wetter-than-normal
conditions. Along the southern tier, states typically experience
drier, warmer conditions. And years with a La Nina usually have
more Atlantic hurricanes than normal.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Irish Parties to Overcome Differences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
urged parties in the British province of Northern Ireland to put
aside their differences and President Bill Clinton is ready to
help when necessary.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart reiterated that the April 1998 Good Friday accord to end
the conflict in Northern Ireland should not be allowed to
collapse.
</P>
<P>
"The president remains ready to intervene in any way... the
parties believe will move the process forward," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"His message is the same for both the Unionists and the
Nationalists, that we have come too far in this process, there is
too much at stake, to allow the issues that divide them to bring
this process down," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
The Good Friday pact, calling for the creation of an all-party
regional assembly to take over many of the tasks of governing the
province from London, was snagged by a dispute over guerrilla
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British Unionists insisted the Irish Republican Army
(IRA) begin to disarm before its political wing Sinn Fein is
permitted to take part in the provincial government. Sinn Fein
rejected the demand.

<P>
KAMPALA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni
returned home Wednesday evening from Algiers where he attended the
35th summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
A release from the presidential office said that while in
Algiers Museveni had a meeting with Yasser Arafat, president of
the National Palestinian Authority and chairman of the executive
committee of the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and other
African leaders.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, Museveni has challenged Africans not to fear
 globalization but rather ensure that it is mutually beneficial to
all people of the world.
</P>
<P>
He said Africans need to overcome the weaknesses which make
their products uncompetitive on the global market.
</P>
<P>
He noted the weaknesses as lack of stability, bad governance,
lack of education, poor infrastructure and over involvement of
government in business.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also stressed the importance of Africans joining the
globalized market with their own cultural and ideological
identity.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of debt relief, he said, it was good but the more
fundamental solution was increasing African production and export
capacity.
</P>
<P>
Museveni cautioned African leaders against proposing solutions
to armed conflicts on the continent without first analysing the
cause.

Other components of the project include evaluation of existing
institutional and technical capabilities of national weather and
climate forecasting organizations, diagnostic analyses of
socio-economic vulnerabilities, and design of implementation plans
and policy proposals.
</P>
<P>
The project will be carried out by the World Meteorological
Organization, with the participation of the International Food
Policy Research Institute, the International Research Institute,

LONDON July 14 (Xinhua) - European bourses finished Wednesday
with modest gains after failing to maintain the momentum provided
by weaker-than-expected economic data.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 rose as much as 90 points just before New
York's session opened. But profit-taking in technology stocks
dragged the index off the session's high.
</P>
<P>
The index closed up 27.5 points, or 0.43 percent, at 6473.1,
after the index started tracking the Dow Jones industrial average
downward in late trading.
</P>
<P>
London's gainers were led by electronics retailer Dixons, which
soared over 5.8 percent and many of the UK's banking stocks also
had a strong session.
</P>
<P>
Barclays was up over 2.9 percent, Natwest Bank jumped over 3
percent, while Woolwich surged over 5.3 percent and Abbey National
put on almost 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax put in a slightly stronger performance to
finish just over 37 points higher at 5610.89, a gain of 0.67
percent.
</P>
<P>
The main gainer was Mannesmann, Germany's second-largest
telecoms company, whose shares rose 3.3 percent after it said it
was not interested in bidding for the UK mobile phone operator
One-2-One.

<HEADLINE> IDB Finances Toll Bridge Project in Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) announced on Wednesday the approval of 73.8 million
U.S. dollars in financing the first toll bridge project in
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The project consists of a two-lane corridor with a four-lane
cable-stayed bridge over the Parana River in Argentina, connecting
the cities of Rosario in Santa Fe province with Victoria in the
province of Entre Rios, the Washington-based IDB said.
</P>
<P>
The 59.3-kilometer federally owned structure, whose total cost
is expected to be 374.2 million dollars, will be built, maintained
and operated by Puentes del Litoral S.A. under a 25-year
concession from the Ministry of Economy and Public Works of
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The project allowed the establishment of a public-private
partnership at the federal and provincial levels with the
participation of national and foreign investors and private toll
operators, demonstrating the effectiveness of mobilizing private
sector risk capital, management and technology.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the operation allows the development of a major
transportation alternative that provides much enhanced
accessibility and mobility to residents of the region and a
stimulus to local area renewal and development.
</P>
<P>
The IDB financing consists of a loan of 33.1 million dollars
from the bank's ordinary capital and a syndicated loan of 40.7
million dollars with funds provided by commercial banks with
subscription of participation agreements with the IDB. Several
international banks have already shown interest in participating,
the IDB said.

<HEADLINE> SADC Tariff Reduction Scheme to Start in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The phased reduction of
tariffs between southern African countries would start on January
1 next year, a meeting in Gaborone, Botswana, of 12 southern
African trade ministers agreed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Tanzanian Trade
Minister Iddi Simba, who chaired the meeting, as saying that by
the end of the year these governments would ratify the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) protocol which provides for
free trade throughout the region within five years.
</P>
<P>
He said this would clear the way for tariffs on the majority of
goods traded between member states to be abolished by January 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
"There is no disagreement over the ratification of the treaty,"
 Simba said. All countries who signed the protocol when it
originated in August 1996 were committed to ratification.
</P>
<P>
The ministers had given their officials a mandate to resolve
problems over rules of origin, a point which had snagged earlier
negotiations, by August 27.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing left to form a bone of contention between us
to prevent ratification. The rules are being clarified and we
have given a mandate to our officials to work them out. They have
a deadline and we will meet again in South Africa on August 27,"
Simba was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Of the 14 SADC member states, only the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) and Seychelles were not represented at the Gaborone
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Opening the meeting, Botswana Commerce Minister George Kgoroba
said the implementation of the trade protocol was the greatest
challenge facing the SADC.
</P>
<P>
"It will tell potential investors that SADC is ready for them,"
he said. "It is the way to achieve full regional integration in
the shortest possible time."
</P>
<P>
SADC Deputy Executive Secretary Prega Ramsamy said
implementation of the protocol would show how ready the SADC was
to become a serious player in the international economic arena.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Botswana, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Namibia and
Mauritius have already ratified the protocol. Two thirds of the
original 11 signatories have to ratify the document before the
SADC secretariat can start the process of implementation.
</P>
<P>
Three phases of tariff reduction are planned. All or the
majority of items in group A, which accounts for 60 percent of
traded goods, will kick in with a zero tariff rating on January 1.
</P>
<P>
Tariffs on group B items will be liberalized gradually over the
five remaining years of the eight-year period. Group C is for
"sensitive" items.
</P>
<P>
SADC negotiator Chungu Mwila said that broadly defined, the A
group was everything except textiles, clothing, assembled motor
vehicles, leather goods and some agricultural products. He
foresaw last-minute special arrangements for sugar and beef, and
the fishing industry.
</P>
<P>
Simba said he was confident any remaining problems over such
items would be resolved before the August meeting, but in any
event would not delay the ratification of the protocol.
</P>
<P>
The 14 SADC members are: Angola, Botswana, DRC, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa,
Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian University Official Suspended over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government Wednesday
announced the suspension of the vice chancellor of the Obafemi
Awolowo University in Osun State following the killing of five
students last Saturday in cult related violence.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Ministry of Education said in a statement issued here
that the decision was made because of "recent events in the
institution" which fixed Thursday and Friday as days of "mourning
in memory of students killed during the mayhem."
</P>
<P>
The suspension decision came a day after students of the
institution stormed a police station in Oshogbo, capital of Osun
State and forcefully took away suspect Idahosa Efosa they had
handed over for interrogation.
</P>
<P>
Efosa was handed over to the police after at least five
students of the institution, including the general secretary of
students association, were shot dead in cult related violence.
</P>
<P>
Yinka Johnson, a student leader, announced Wednesday the arrest
of five persons in connection with that incident, adding that
"three of them have confessed to participating in the shooting"
and that Vice Chancellor Wale Omole had been declared "wanted by
the students".
</P>
<P>
The vice chancellor of the institution, one of the country's
premier universities, had been criticized for "treating cult
members in the institution with kid gloves."
</P>
<P>
The student leader said investigations by the students showed
Saturday's killings were perpetrated by "a collection of cultists
from the eastern and western zones of the country".
</P>
<P>
The students said they decided to take the law into their hands
after an incident in March this year when the police released five
cult members handed over by the students.
</P>
<P>
Cult membership recently became a problem in tertiary
institutions in the west African country after inter-cult clashes
left hundreds of fellow students dead across the country.

<HEADLINE> S. African Countries Fail to Finalize Free Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Southern African trade
ministers Wednesday failed to finalize a free trade agreement for
the region at a meeting in Gaborone, Agence France Presse (AFP)
quoted Tanzanian Trade and Industry Minister Iddi Simba as saying.
</P>
<P>
But Simba, who chairs the ministerial committee of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), held out hope that the
phased reduction of trade tariffs between countries in the region
would still begin by January next year.
</P>
<P>
He said officials from SADC's 14 member states would meet in
South Africa on August 27 to put the finishing touches to the
agreement before a SADC summit in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is to clear the way for the abolition of tariffs
on at least 60 percent of goods traded between member states from
January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The protocol will be on schedule," Simba said at a news
conference in Gaborone. "We are going to work very hard to make
sure that it will begin in January."
</P>
<P>
"The meeting in South Africa is where the ministers are
expected to agree on the outstanding issues," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Simba said negotiations faltered on two cornerstones of the
agreement -- the tariff reduction schedule and the rule of the
origin of goods.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Southern African Customs Union -- South Africa,
Namibia, Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland -- were happy with the
proposed eight-year reduction schedule, while less industrialized
non-members wanted the process to be stretched out over 10 to 15
years.
</P>
<P>
South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin said
progress has nonetheless been made on the two outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
"We have been waiting to get a clearer indication on the rules
of origin and tariff reduction before we could ratify the
protocol. We are now going to present a bill calling for the
ratification of the SADC protocol before the next parliamentary
session," he said.
</P>
<P>
Simba said Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zambia
indicated that they too were prepared to ratify the agreement
before the end of the year -- paving the way for implementation.
</P>
<P>
He said member states, notably South Africa and Zimbabwe, will
in the meanwhile continue bilateral talks on tariff reductions.
</P>
<P>
Erwin and his Zimbabwean counterpart Nathan Shamuyarira are to
meet in Bulowayo, southern Zimbabwe, Thursday to discuss improved
access for Zimbabwean goods to the South African market.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, Mongolia, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President
Nachagyn Bagabandy reiterated here Thursday afternoon that
Mongolia adheres to its principled stance on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy told visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin during
their talks that "There is only one China in the world and Taiwan
is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory. The government of
the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government
representing the whole China."
</P>
<P>
Jiang recalled his explanation to Bagabandy about China's
stance on the Taiwan issue during his visit to China last December.
</P>
<P>
Bagabandy then in return expressed his understanding and
agreement of China's stand, stressing that Mongolia supported
China's principle of "One country, two systems; and Peaceful
reunification" and did not support the independence of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciation of the stand taken by the
Mongolian government and believed the Mongolian side will continue
to stick to its correct stance.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Dispels Rumors On Troop Withdrawal From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Army Thursday
 dispelled rumors that the withdrawal of its troops from the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was expected to start nest
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the army Chancellor Diye said that the withdrawal
was, as indicated by Defense Minister Moven Mahachi Monday,
expected to start within next three to four months.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency quoted the spokesman as saying that
the troops would only be withdrawn after the United Nations had
deployed its peace- keeping forces in the vast central African
country.
</P>
<P>
"The withdrawal will depend on the situation on the ground,"
said Diye. " Once the rebels sign the cease-fire agreement and
once it holds and when the United Nations peace-keeping force has
taken over from us, then the withdrawal will start."
</P>
<P>
"It will also depend on whether there are signs that the
cease-fire is working or not. According to our timetable in the
cease-fire agreement, it will start in about four months," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to recent reports, Zimbabwe would not contribute any
troops to the U.N. peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
Recent press reports said Zimbabwe would contribute about 2,000
soldiers for peace-keeping efforts.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, together with Namibia, Angola and Chad, deployed
troops to the DRC when the Tutsi-led rebels allegedly backed by
Uganda and Rwanda launched an attack on DRC President Laurent
Kabila's forces in early August last year.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord was signed by the Southern African Development
 Community leaders, plus the leaders of Rwanda and Uganda in
Zambian capital Lusaka last week.
</P>
<P>
However, DRC rebels, due to their clashes within, refused to
sign the cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord is aimed at re-establishing Kinshasa's control
over the whole of the third largest African country and merge
three main separate rebel forces with the government army.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Beijing Public
Security Bureau said today that some foreigners have recently
committed a number of thefts, robberies, acts of swindling or
other crimes in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
By mid-July, Beijing police had investigated 46 such cases,
mostly in shops, hotels, clothes markets, and booking offices.
</P>
<P>
The suspects often used foreign currency exchange or asking for
change as a cover.In one case, on July 7, a foreigner went to a
market in Fengtai District in southwestern Beijing to buy some
cloth and took 8,000 yuan (about 960 U.S. dollars) from the
peddler when the man went to get change for him.
</P>
<P>
Beijing police have reminded people, especially shopkeepers at
the local level to be on the alert against foreign criminals and
to help police stop these crimes.
</P>
<P>
There are now 25 people from Africa, Southeast Asia, Europe,
and America serving time in Beijing, according to Beijing Youth
Daily, mostly for fraud, violence, rape, or trying to get state
secrets.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Accepts OAU Peace Formula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea has formally accepted
proposals put forward by the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
to end its border war with Ethiopia, according to a new release
from the Eritrean Foreign Ministry available here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the closing of the 35th OAU summit in Algiers Wednesday,
Eritrean President Isaias Afewerki announced Eritrea's official
acceptance of the Modalities for the Implementation of the OAU
Framework, according to the news release.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement was done "in the interests of
peace, which we owe not only to the people of Eritrea but also to
the people of Ethiopia, and our continent as a whole," said the
Eritrean president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Eritrean Foreign Ministry accused Ethiopia of being
ambiguous over the agreement while "indulging in strident and
invective language against Eritrea".
</P>
<P>
The new revised framework agreement calls for armies from both
sides to withdraw from position held before May 6 last year when
the two nations went to war over a disputed part of their common
border.
</P>
<P>
It is not settled whether a peace-keeping force will monitor
the withdrawals, but the next step is for independent arbiters to
judge which land belongs to whom.
</P>
<P>
Despite the mediation made by the international community,
there is no immediate end visible to the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Urges International Community to Exert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
Thursday stressed that a shift in Turkey's position on Cyprus
would come about if the U.N. Security Council, the G-8, Europe
and others exert their influence on Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks after a commemoration service for those who
died in July 1974.
</P>
<P>
On July 15, 1974, the Greek junta, then ruling Greece,
orchestrated a coup against Cyprus president Archbishop
Makarios. Five days later, Turkish troops invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island.
</P>
<P>
Since then Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish
Cypriots-controlled north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey's long standing goal has been to secure sovereignty,
decisions by consensus, equal representation, rotating presidency
and a separate state," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
All these, he added, are elements that make up a confederation
and "they were rejected and are rejected now as well."
</P>
<P>
Any change in Turkey's position would depend to a great extent
on whether the international community exerts its influence in
the same direction, Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
"A Cyprus settlement must be found in the framework of
U.N. Security Council resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led international community has been trying for
decades to reunite the Cyprus island through a bi-zonal,
bi-communal federation formula, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> China Making LNG Imports Part Of Its Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua)-- China will make liquefied natural
gas (LNG) facilities part of its unified planning, according to
Zhang Guobao, the Deputy Secretary General of the State
Development Planning Commission (SDPC).
</P>
<P>
Detailed feasibility studies have to be conducted to avoid any
hasty decision, he says, but a proposal is for first-phase
construction of a 3-million-ton/year LNG receiving terminal at
Chentoujiao in the southern city of Shenzhen that is expected to
be completed by 2005, Zhang said at a two-day seminar.
</P>
<P>
There will also be a natural gas grid extending about 267
kilometers and two new gas-fueled power plants.
</P>
<P>
In addition, three power plants using oil as fuel at present
will switch to natural gas and LNG will be piped to Shenzhen,
Dongguan, Guangzhou, and Foshan and supplied to Hong Kong for
power and urban use.
</P>
<P>
During the second-phase of the project, which is scheduled for
operation in 2009, capacity of the terminal will be expanded to
five million tons of LNG a year and the city gas grid will be
further extended by 240 kilometers Zhuhai and other cities.

<HEADLINE> WFP Launches New Program for Ultra-poor Women in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
officially launched a new 18-month cycle of the Vulnerable Groups
Development (VGD) program here Thursday to help the ultra-poor
women in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The program will help the poor women to come out of extreme
poverty, State Minister for Women and Children Affairs Zinnatun
Nessa Talukder said at the inaugural function, which was attended
by Dr. Werner Kiene, the country representative of the WFP,
officials from government agencies, non-governmental
organizations, donors and ex-VGD beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the important role played by the VGD program in
helping the poor women to come out of extreme poverty, she said
the government has taken various steps to make the program more
development-oriented.
</P>
<P>
The new cycle, which started on July 1, 1999, will provide food
assistance to about 500,000 ultra-poor women all over the country.
This is the largest poverty alleviation program assisted by the
WFP across the world, a press release said.
</P>
<P>
Kiene explained the new concept of food assistance as a tool
for "enabling development" emerging in the worldwide context.
</P>
<P>
The 30 million ultra-poor people in Bangladesh, who consume
less than 1,800 kilo-calorie a day, are not yet part of the
mainstream development process, he pointed out. They deserve
support for them and for their children, he added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the role of food assistance, Kiene said food
assistance through the VGD program enables the poor women to
graduate to a level from where they can look for other development
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The VGD program provides food assistance of 30 kilograms of
wheat to poor women over a period of 18 months. The beneficiaries
also receive training in income-generating activities,
awareness-raising on legal rights, health and nutrition issues and
credit. After the 18-month food support period, then women become
members of NGOs, thereby able to further improve their
socio-economic condition in a suitable way.
</P>
<P>
The program, which started in 1975 as a relief intervention,
has shifted its focus over the years from relief to development,
having covering about 8,336,000 poor women worldwide since its
inception in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier's Prescription For Economic Ills (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji gave his
prescriptions for the country's weak consumer demand, declining
exports and foreign investment, slow increase in fixed-asset
investments, and dropping consumer prices to cabinet members and
provincial governors here today.
</P>
<P>
 This included increased investment in infrustructure,
technology and education, revamping state-owned enterprises (SEO),
and allowing foreign investment in more industries.
</P>
<P>
 Zhu said that the economic situation has been positive and
encouraging thanks to the "active" financial policy of late last
year. The GDP for the first half of 1999 grew 7.6 percent over
the same period of last year, summer harvests were satisfactory,
industrial production was on the rise, and SEOs saw growth in
profits.
</P>
<P>
 However, because of the changing international and domestic
situation in March and April, certain problems in the Chinese
economy have surfaced and insufficient market demand is especially
noticeable, he said, pointing to 5 aspects of work that need to be
considered for economic development this year:
</P>
<P>
 -- More government funds need to go to infrastructure,
technical innovations at SEOs, and especially to the inerior of
China.

<TEXT>

<P>
 -- Consumer spending should be increased by increasing
incomes of urban and rural people, with special attention being
paid to the large number of medium and low-income people and the
large rural population. Policies on increasing consumer loans must
be formulated as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
 -- Exports should be increased by taking steps to attract
more foreign investment and to use it effectively. Foreign
investment should be allowed in a wider range of fields and
policies that adversely affect foreign investment should be
adjusted and services for foreign-funded enterprises in China
should be significantly improved.
</P>
<P>
 -- Reforms of SEOs are to be carried out according to recent
instructions from President Jiang Zemin. The process of
modernizing their management must be sped up and burdens on
enterprises need to be eased to reach the goal of revamping large
and medium-sized SEOs by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
-- The 9-year compulsory education system must be
implemented and high-school, vocational, and higher education need
to be encouraged to make education a lucrative business, to
stimulate the growth of related fields, and to benefit society in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
 Zhu told those gathered that they should have a clear idea
about the current economic situation, and recommit themselves to
combating problems. He said he himself is confident about the
prospect.

semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
This is the second similar incident in northern Greece in less
than two months. On May 29, an Albanian armed with an assault
rifle and a hand grenade hijacked a Greek bus with passengers on
board near Thessaloniki. After being paid ransom of 50 million
drachmas (about 158,730 U.S. dollars), the 24-year-old Albanian
forced the driver to cross over into Albania where he and a Greek
hostage were shot to death by Albanian police.
</P>
<P>
The crisis came at an exceptionally sensitive moment in
Greek-Albanian relations, amidst Greece's efforts to round up and
deport illegal immigrants and consequent protests by Albania over
charges of Greek police brutality against Albanian nationals.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Interior Minister Vasso Papandreou, who is chairing a
crisis management committee comprised of herself and the press,
defense and public order ministers, said that negotiations between
the Greek police and the Albanian hijacker were continuing with
patience, persistence and calm. But, she said, the man continued
to insist on his initial demand of a ransom of 250 million
drachmas (about 793,650 dollars) and safe passage to Albania with
all his hostages.
</P>
<P>
The Greek police are now trying hard to resolve the problem
within Greek territory.
</P>
<P>
A team of psychologists, accompanied by senior police officers,
have been choppered into the area, which has already been closed
off by special police forces.

<P>
BONN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- German veteran Lothar Matthaeus has
said he will captain the national team at the Confederations Cup
soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Bayern Munich libero said he would take over Oliver
Bierhoff in the July 24 to August 4 event in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Bierhoff, who is with the Italian club AC Milan, asked to be
left out of the squad to prepare for the new season in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Matthaeus said: "We have a team with very little experience and
nobody would have understood if a player with five caps had worn
the captain's armband."
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Berlin newspaper Tagesspiegel quoted
German coach Erich Ribbeck as saying that Matthaeus, who has a
world record of 136 international caps, would occupy the absence
of striker Oliver Bierhoff at the Confederations Cup.
</P>
<P>
Ribbeck also assured the Bayern Munich sweeper a place in the
Euro 2000 finals in Belgium and the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin's Aide Denies Having Swiss Bank Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Top Kremlin aide Pavel Borodin
denied on Thursday media reports that he or his wife has accounts
in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
"Neither I nor my wife have anything to do with Swiss bank
accounts. I have not engaged in commercial or any other activities
in Switzerland," the Interfax news agency quoted Borodin as saying.
</P>
<P>
The denial came after reports that prosecutors in Geneva,
Switzerland, announced Wednesday that they have opened a criminal
money-laundering investigation into Borodin, his wife and 22
others, many of them purportedly highly placed Russian state
officials.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors said the investigation, opened by the Geneva
General Prosecutor Bernard Bertossa, would link Russian officials
to money laundering in Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
No charges have yet been filed, but Bertossa's staff is
checking into whether the 24 people had Geneva bank accounts and
how they used them.
</P>
<P>
"We have reason to suspect it was bribe money being laundered,
" The Moscow Times newspaper quoted investigating magistrate
Daniel Deveau as saying.
</P>
<P>
Borodin said his department, which oversees the renovation of
the Kremlin, was audited by a team of 122 inspectors in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"They found nothing criminal in my work or the operation of my
department," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have said many times that all these media attacks on me
have been made at clearly political orders," Borodin said. "One
can invent anything."
</P>
<P>
He said he did not receive any official notification from
Swiss prosecutors about the opening of a case.
</P>
<P>
"I want to say once again that this dirty campaign has evident
political undertones," Borodin said.
</P>
<P>
In March, Russian prosecutors entered the Kremlin to seize
documents from Borodin's office related to renovation work by
Mabetex, a Swiss-based construction firm.
</P>
<P>
Mabetex is run by an expatriate Kosovar Albanian, Bahgjet
Pacolli, and has won lucrative construction projects across the
former Soviet Union -- from renovating the Kremlin to rebuilding
both the TsUM department store in central Moscow and the
international air terminal in Kazakhstan's new capital of Astana,
The Moscow Times said.
</P>
<P>
In April, Borodin's apartment was searched, according to a
report at the time by Komsomolskaya Pravda, which said the search
turned up documents of about 100 million U.S. dollars in various
wire transfers to personal accounts in Switzerland, Liechtenstein
and the Bahamas. Borodin later denied those allegations.

The "Cox Report" alleged that Chinese Research Institute of

by utilizing the chances of lab-to-lab interactions with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
"After getting approval from the Chinese government and the
American government in 1994, CRIEP and three American national
laboratories including Los Alomos Laboratory started cooperation
and exchanges," said CRIEP president Zhu Zuliang at a press
conference held here today by the Information Office of the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
"Such cooperation and exchanges are completely conducted
within the framework approved by the two countries," Zhu said. "
The issues concerned in these cooperation and exchanges are arms
control and environmental protection. And in terms of arms control,
it includes the nuclear nonproliferation."
</P>
<P>
Zhu has been engaged in manufacturing nuclear weapons for
decades, who has participated in organizing and leading the
development of China's nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"All the Chinese and American scientists and officials
participating in such cooperation and exchanges know where their
national interests and national security lie, and the
responsibility they assumed for it," he said, adding that it was
impossible for anyone to touch upon nuclear weapon secret
information.
</P>
<P>
"The fields involved are determined beforehand," Zhu said.
Whether it was a visit to the US laboratory or to the Chinese
laboratory, it was in the unsecured areas.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Refugees in Kenya Fly Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) Thursday started the repatriation operations of
more than 1,400 Ethiopian refugees from the Dadaab camps in
northeastern Kenya to Gode and JIjiga, Ethiopia's Ogaden Region.
</P>
<P>
The operation kicked off Thursday morning as the
UNHCR-chartered aircraft landed in Dadaab and 53 refugees boarded
the plane for a two-hour flight to Gode, said the UNHCR branch
office in Kenyan capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Each of the returnees received a reintegration package and food
aid plus the equivalent of 60 U.S. dollars to assist them to
reach their home areas and to get reestablished, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The airlift marks the last large return movement of long-time
Ethiopian refugees from Kenya, which once hosted nearly 100,000
Ethiopians, and some of the returnees have been assisted at the
camps since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The agency expects the airlift operations to continue for the
next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
Yvette Stevens, UNHCR representative to Kenya and Somalia, said
her agency only hoped that conflicts in the Horn of Africa could
be resolved so that "we do not see any further refugees from a
region that so much deserves the benefits of peace."
</P>
<P>
There are some 180,000 refugees in Kenya, down from 420,000 in
1992 following repatriation operations mainly to Ethiopia and
Somalia, according to UNHCR branch office here.

BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The '99 China Ecological Tour
Hunan Zhangjiajie International Forest Protection Festival will be
held from September 22 to 27 in Zhangjiajie City in Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The festival's theme is " Man and Nature, Fusion of Nature with
Culture". It is sponsored by the National Tourism Administration,
State Environmental Protection Administration, Chinese Academy of
Sciences and Hunan Provincial Government.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, Lu Pinyi, the mayor of
Zhangjiajie, said that its purpose is to increase public awareness
of the need for ecologic protection and to improve tourism
services.
</P>
<P>
He expected Zhangjiajie to have more than 100,000 tourists
during the festival, and he said the city can provide
accommodation for them.
</P>
<P>
Zhangjiajie, in northwestern Hunan has a population of 1.54
million, 72 percent of them members of ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
In 1982, Zhangjiajie was approved by the State Council as the
first state forest park in China, and was listed as one of the

<HEADLINE> Cox Report Further Refuted (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of the
State Council of China released here today an artile entitled "
Facts Speak Louder Than Words and Lies Will Collapse by Themselves-
-Further Refutation of the Cox Report." Following is the full text
of the artile:
</P>
<P>
On May 31, the head of the Information Office of the State
Council made a speech on the US National Security and Military/
Commercial Concerns With the People's Republic of China (
hereinafter referred to as the Cox Report) released by the Select
Committee of the US House of Representatives. He pointed out that
the concoction of the Cox Report was a farce with the aim of
instigating anti-China sentiments and undermining Sino-US
relations.
</P>
<P>
In order to clarify the truth and air the facts, the
Information Office of the State Council has conducted further
investigations of the issues raised in the report.
</P>
<P>
Voluminous facts indicate that the essence of this report is to
fan anti-China feeling and undermine Sino-US relations. To achieve
this political purpose, the report leaves no stone unturned to
distort facts, substitute one thing for another, make subjective
assumptions and groundless accusations and resort to demagoguery.
</P>
<P>
The conclusions of the report, therefore, are utterly absurd
and do not hold water. Moreover, it even acts contrary to the
general knowledge of basic science and technology in many aspects.
The release of the report has not only aroused the strong
indignation of the Chinese people, but also invited severe
criticism from personages with breadth of vision in the
international community, including the United States.

BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- France's Pasteur Merieux Connaught
has made a vaccine donation to protect some 1,000 senior citizens
in Beijing from pneumococcal pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
It also donated 1.6 million yuan worth of vaccine for the
elderly in 8 other Chinese cities today.
</P>
<P>
At least a million people around the world are killed by
pneumonia caused by pneumococcus bacteria, which can also lead to
other illnesses like spinal meningitis, pleuritis, and myocarditis.
Vaccination is the best way to prevent pneumococcal pneumonia,
because the overuse of antibiotics has resulted in drug resistance.
</P>
<P>
China has at least 2.5 million cases of pneumonia annually and
125,000 deaths as a result of pneumococcal infection. The death
rate of pneumococcal pneumonia is as high as 28.6 percent among
people over the age of 50.
</P>

Pasteur Merieux Connaught has donated typhoid fever vaccines
and hepatitis A vaccines in the past two years, according to the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Interior decoration is increasing
in popularity in China, where 95 billion yuan worth of business is
done annually in decoration projects.
</P>
<P>
More than 95 percent of the country's newly-built homes have
had decoration work.
</P>
<P>
In addition to paying more attention to food, clothing,
entertainment and cars, the ordinary Chinese are now spending more
on home decorations. In big cities like Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Harbin, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Dalian and Chengdu, this is
especially true.
</P>
<P>
China's urbanites have decorated their homes at an average cost
of at least 20,000 yuan. Total sales of home decoration materials
in Beijing exceeded 2 billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts here expect that by the year 2002, the country's total
housing floor space will exceed 5 billion square meters, and a
potential total of 83 million apartment units will be decorated,
at a total cost of 30 billion yuan each year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Qizheng, the head of the
State Council's Information Office, today said the best thing that
the U.S. government could do would be to earnestly make clear the
cause of the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Zhao made the remark in response to a Cable News Network (CNN)
correspondent at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese readers have noticed the fact that there was no
substantial investigation into the matter and that the United
States rushed to declared that the bombing was a mistake because
of the use of outdated maps, he said, as explained by a special
envoy of the U.S. President, Thomas Pickering, who said that all
three maps were outdated.
</P>
<P>
Pickering explained that, in addition to the use of outdated
maps, a series of other errors contributed to the mistake, Zhao
said. But, there was little probability of this, he said.
</P>
<P>
To be using three wrong maps together is like assuming that
three dice would land on the same number simultaneously, Zhao said,
adding that this was something like a one-two-hundred-and-
sixteenth probability.
</P>
<P>
Considering other scores of "errors", he said, the probability
of such a case is almost zero.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he believed there was any link between the "Cox
Report" and the Chinese Embassy bombing, Zhao said that he did not
believe that there was any connection. But at least the report
showed that Cox has no good will for China, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's State Council Information Office held a press
conference today to refuted the "Cox Report".

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leader Ready to Talk With Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leader Hussein
Mohamed Aidid Thursday condemned what he called the Ethiopian
military intervention in Somalia, on which the Ethiopian
government has not given its comment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to his supporters in south Mogadishu, Aidid strongly
criticized what he called the new approach of Ethiopia in which he
said Ethiopia is dividing Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The faction leader expressed concern by mentioning that the
Ethiopian troops are only 180 kilometers away from the Somali
capital.
</P>
<P>
However, Aidid said "we're going to have a face-to-face meeting
with Ethiopia in Tripoli." He noted that Libya is playing an
important role in mediating between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Aidid said that he would negotiate with Ethiopia on all issues
other than Somalia's reconciliation and the unity of the Horn of
Africa country.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, tension is still high as the Ethiopian troops
allegedly keep advancing towards the territories controlled by
Aidid in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 Ethiopian troops are reportedly manning two
major military bases inside Somalia.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Aidid's militiamen are being strengthened
by several hundred Oromo-ethnic Ethiopians in defending the only
tarmac Airport of Ballidogleh from the advancing Ethiopian troops.
 The Oromo- ethnic group are opposing to Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi's government in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
Military analysts here foresee that both the defensive tactics
being played and the trenches dug in the front lines will
contribute to serious resistance if the Ethiopians try to take
Ballidogleh airport.
</P>
<P>
However, Colonel Omar Hashi Aden of Hiran region has criticized
Aidid for violating their territories by making Oromo and
Eritreans pass through Hiran region.
</P>
<P>
He warned that possible clannish war may flare up if the
practice is repeated.
</P>
<P>
Conflicting reports also indicated that the Ethiopian troops
have also far reached the village of Farsoley, about 20 km north
of Qoryoley town, which is only 165 km south of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Qoryoley town is among the target towns for the Ethiopians
since the Oromo-ethnic Ethiopians have been given their base
there.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Consumer Price
Index (CPI) for June this year rose by 2.1 percent to 118.8 points
from 116.3 points in June last year, the Statistics Department
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The index, however, decreased by 0.1 percent when compared with
118.9 points in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The CPI rose 3.3 percent to 118.6 points in January-June this
year from 114.8 points in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The department attributed the 3.3 percent increase in the index
in January-June this year to increases in the indices of seven
main groups such as food, beverages and tobacco, medical care and
health expenses, recreation, entertainment and cultural services.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the index for clothing and footwear fell 1.9
percent to 97.7 points while that for transport and communication
was flat at 103.9 points.
</P>
<P>
The department said the two main groups of food and gross rent
and fuel and power together accounted for 75.6 percent of the
overall increase recorded in the current period.
</P>
<P>
The department also said the 0.1 percent decrease in June over
May CPI was brought about by falls in three main groups, namely,
miscellaneous goods and services, food and recreation,
entertainment, education and cultural services.

<HEADLINE> Jiang on China-Mongolia Trade Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, Mongolia, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese
President Jiang Zemin said here Thursday afternoon that China has
always attached importance to developing economic and trade
cooperation with Mongolia on the basis of equality and mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during his talks with Mongolian
President Nachagyn Bagabandy.
</P>
<P>
As neighboring countries, China and Mongolia enjoy a number of
advantages to develop their economic and trade cooperation, the
Chinese president said, adding that the two countries have broad
cooperative areas and great potentials to tap.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of equality and mutual benefit, the cooperation
should be carried out in insightful and realistic ways and in line
with each's realistic conditions, the rules of the market economy
and international practices, he said.
</P>
<P>
To that end, he put forwards five suggestions for the future
cooperation:
</P>
<P>
First, both sides should fully make use of such existing
channels as the mutual visits of leaders between the two countries
and the China-Mongolia Economic, Trade, Scientific and
Technological Cooperative Committee so that the two sides can
promptly push forward and direct their cooperation in macro-
economic level.
</P>
<P>
Second, China is willing to encourage its competent
corporations to invest in Mongolia and expand various cooperation
by clinching wholly-owned or joint ventures in Mongolia. Moreover,
China urged the Mongolian side to improve the investment
environment and guarantee the legal rights of Chinese investors.
</P>
<P>
Third, both countries can make use of the other's advantages
for Mongolia has abundant resources and China has technologies and
equipment suitable to the Mongolian needs.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, border trade constitutes an important part of Sino-
Mongolian economic and trade relations. The two sides should
strengthen management in the regard so as to ensure its healthy
and orderly development.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, both side should pay high attention and give full play
to the Beijing-Ulan Bator-Moscow railway, which is a rail line
linking up Asia and Europe continents, in a bid to promote the
development of each's national economy and foreign trade.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Thursday that Central Asia is of "special geopolitical
and strategic importance" to Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing and no one will prevent our countries from building
equitable, mutually advantageous and good-neighborly relations,"
Ivanov told reporters following his arrival at Tashkent, capital
of Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to meet with Uzbek President Islam Karimov and
Foreign Minister Abdulaziz Kamilov, and to discuss the entire
spectrum of bilateral relations, as well as international issues
of mutual interest, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said strong cooperation between Moscow and Tashkent "
will facilitate the solution of regional problems," including the
work to combat extremism, terrorism, drug contraband and
transnational crime.
</P>
<P>
At the start of his talks with Ivanov, Uzbek Foreign Minister
Abdulaziz Kamilov said they would check the highlights of the
planned visit of Russian Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin to
Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will focus on a wide range of problems in
bilateral relations and regional matters. "We would also like to

<HEADLINE> China's Finance Ministry Expects T-Bonds To Sell Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Treasury bonds that will be issued
from July 15 to August 31 are expected to be received with
enthusiasm by investors, according to a Finance Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
The official says that the 50 billion yuan worth of T-bonds are
exclusively for private investors and have interest rates 0.32
percentage points higher than for 3-year savings deposits and 0.37
percentage points higher than for 5-year savings deposits.
</P>
<P>
China cut interest rates on savings accounts since May and
Chinese have been less likely to put their money into savings
accounts, he says, so the T-bonds should be an attractive item.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for the Ministry of Finance to issue T-
bonds exclusively for private investors this year. At the first
issue in March, the bonds sold much sooner than was expected.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has increased the number of outlets for them this
time and is allowing some post offices to sell them.
</P>
<P>
China has issued 163.4 billion yuan worth of T-bonds since the
beginning of the year, 100 billion yuan of them for private
investors.
</P>
<P>
The official says that the Ministry will issue more in the
second-half.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the 6th National
Congress of Returned Overseas Chinese and Relatives, which ended
here today, refuted recent remarks by Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
Lin Zhaoshu, the newly elected Chairman of the All-China
Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said at today's closing
ceremony that Lee's remarks caused great indignation among all
deputies to the congress, who say they will support the Chinese
government in safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
He said that the federation and its branches should focus more
on introducing capital and talented people from overseas and
increase its role as a bridge to the rest of the world to make a
greater contribution to the reunification of the country.
</P>
<P>
Yang Guoqing, president of the All-China Federation of Taiwan
Compatriots, also criticised Lee's remarks at a forum that was
attended by members of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government
League and the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, saying
that Lee Teng-hui is attempting to separate Taiwan from China and
make the Taiwan issue an international one.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kehui, the chairman of the Central Commitee of the
Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, said at the forum that
the one-China policy is the foundation of cross-straits relations
and that Lee's remarks reveal his intention to undermine China's
national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and this is

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Hopes to Inject Vigor to Export Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Commerce and Finance
Minister Ishaq Dar said Thursday fiscal relief, non tax measures
and abolition of anomalies under the new trade policy will help
foster export growth, halving trade deficit to 800 million U.S.
dollars during 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
Exports and imports targets for the new fiscal beginning from
July 1 have been set at 9 billion dollars and 9.8 billion dollars,
according to the new trade policy announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The targets are "realistic under the prevailing economic
atmosphere," Dar told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
During fiscal 1998-99, Pakistan registered a trade deficit of
1.56 billion dollars as exports totaled 7.72 billion dollars while
imports amounting to 9.28 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dar said the trade policy for 1999-2000 has been carefully
conceived keeping two major aspects in view.
</P>
<P>
First, the policy should facilitate the strategy for export-led
growth by increasing export earnings, reducing the trade deficit
and supporting the balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he said, as Pakistan enters a new millennium of
globalization, with competition intensifying for market share, "we
need also to prepare ourselves for the challenges and obligations
of various WTO agreements."
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the new exports target was "most likely"
to be achieved in view of unit value picking up and world trade
recording enhanced activity.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that various incentives and concessions granted under
the policy fabric will help unleash conducive and hospitable
milieu and explore non-conventional avenues to propel exports
pace.
</P>
<P>
The new policy provides income tax relief to increase exports
of engineering, contracting and consultancy services, exports of
branded rice, fish and other food items as well as gem stone
exports.
</P>
<P>
Besides income tax relief, the exports are also entitled to
many other duty concessions.
</P>
<P>
Dar also explained changes in the import policy to promote
exports and national production.
</P>
<P>
These include a sales tax exemption on the import of new or
used machinery and equipment for the domestic housing and
construction industry as well as the import of bulldozers and
angle dozers without payment of customs duty and sales tax.
</P>
<P>
Dar also told journalists that Special Commercial Courts at
Lahore and Karachi are being immediately set up to expedite
resolution of trade disputes and complaints.

<P>
TOKYO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko
Komura assured a visiting senior Chinese official Thursday that
Japan's "one-China" policy remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Komura made the pledge during a meeting with Song Jian,
chairman of the China-Japan Friendship Association and vice
chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent separatist remarks of Taiwan's Lee Teng-
hui, Komura told Song that Japan remains committed to the 1972
Japan-China Joint Statement, in which Tokyo recognizes Beijing as
the sole legitimate government of China, and says it understands
and respects the Chinese government's stand that Taiwan is an
inalienable part of China.
</P>
<P>
Lee said in an interview with a German radio station on July 9
that cross-straits relations should be defined as "state-to-state
or at least special state-to-state relations."
</P>
<P>
Song, who is now in Tokyo on an eight-day visit to Japan,
welcomed Komura's assurance.

<HEADLINE> Russia Hails Latvian President's Decision on Language Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Russia welcomed Thursday Latvian
President Vaira Vike-Freiberga's decision to return a
controversial language bill to parliament for revision.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry said Vike-Freiberga made the "
realistic" decision in rejecting the bill, which was approved by
the parliament last Thursday and had prompted concerns from
neighboring Russia and international organizations for its
perceived discrimination against minority rights.
</P>
<P>
It mandates the use of the Latvian language at most public
functions and in business, even those involving only Russian
speakers, who account for 40 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
"Now, the matter rests with the Latvian parliament. Latvian
lawmakers should heed the opinion of the international community
and make the necessary amendments to the draft law in order to
ensure legitimate rights of ethnic minorities who make up almost
half of the population of Latvia," the Russian Foreign Ministry
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, also
welcomed the Latvian president's decision.
</P>
<P>
Latvian President Vike-Freiberga explained her decision in a
special television program, Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
"If we took the road to Europe, we should prove our ability to
harmonize our laws with European norms," the president said.
</P>
<P>
She said shortcomings in the bill were made due to haste
rather than as "an unfriendly gesture with respect to other
countries."
</P>
<P>
The same mistake should not be repeated in the future and it
is necessary to hold thorough consultations with international
experts and local specialists, Vike-Freiberga said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Denies Illegal Arms Supply to S.Lankan Tamil Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will never allow Sri
Lankan Tamil rebels operating on its soil nor allow illegal arms
supply through its territorial waters, said visiting Myanmar
Foreign Minister U Win Aung Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It's not our policy to interfere into other country's domestic
affairs," said U Win Aung, the first Myanmar foreign minister to
visit Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
U Win Aung arrived here Wednesday night for a two-day visit as
the first leg of his tour of South Asia and Southeast Asia. He
will also visit Bangladesh, Singapore and other countries later
this month.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Sri Lanka can cooperate to curb illegal arms supply
to Tamil rebels by sharing information, the minister told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been battling separatist Tamil rebels who demand
a homeland for minority Tamils in the north and east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Illegal arms supply to Tamil rebels is believed to prolong the
16-year-old war and has aroused serious concern of the Sri Lankan
government.
</P>
<P>
As to the speculation of illegal arms supply to Tamil rebels, U
Win Aung said, "If direct source is us, we will tackle this
problem."
</P>
<P>
Thursday morning, U Win Aung met with Sri Lankan acting Foreign
Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, he proposed to activate a joint commission
set up in 1993 to enhance the cultural, economical and trade ties

<HEADLINE> U.N. Team Starts Destroying Chemical Agents in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. technical team, which is
entrusted to remove toxic chemical agents left behind by U.N. arms
inspectors, started its work on Thursday, said a U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
Prakash Shah, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's representative
in Baghdad, told reporters that the U.N. team started on Thursday
to destroy the chemical agents and mustard gas samples left behind
by the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq in its
Baghdad laboratory.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team, led by South Africa's chemical production
technologist Dirk van Niekerk, comprises four chemical experts
from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons
(OPCW) in the Hague and an independent biological weapons expert.
</P>
<P>
These U.N. experts are from China, Russia, Poland and
Germany. Yako Yalato, a Finnish, former Assistant Director of
U.N. Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Center (BMVC), acts as
guide for the U.N. technical team which arrived in Baghdad on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.N. reached an agreement last month on the
composition of the technical team to close UNSCOM's Baghdad
laboratory where one kilogram of mustard gas and VX gas were left
behind by UNSCOM before it withdrew from Iraq last December.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM suspended its work of weapons inspections in Iraq last
December when the United States and Britain launched four-night
airstrikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Iraqi News Agency reported
earlier Thursday that Iraqi technical experts led by Presidential
Adviser Amer al-Saadi and the U.N. technical team held talks at
BMVC on how and where to destroy these mustard gas and chemical
agents.

<HEADLINE> China Restructures Tax Offices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China is reshuffling its one-
million-strong tax offices personnel through re-organization,
evaluation, and ideological education in order to make them meet
the demand of the market economy and enhance the use of taxes as
an economic lever.
</P>
<P>
Jin Renqing, commissioner of the State Administration of
Taxation (SAT), said the tax system still has "many problems"
despite major restructuring over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The problems include overlapping organizations, insufficient
management, inadequate supervision, overhead, and not qualified
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Jin noted that some tax offices have employed so many temporary
workers to levy taxes that their inexperience has damaged the
image of the government.
</P>
<P>
He said that the tax system will continue to restructure its
organizations and make clear their specific functions this year,
adding that the number of employees at province-level tax offices
will be slashed and redundant staff will be relocated to lower
level offices. He said that the one million employees of tax
offices around the country will undergo strict evaluations of
their professional proficiency and those who fail the evaluation
will be laid off and re-trained.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Municipal Bureau of National Tax in the city
of Yichang in central China's Hubei Province has laid off and
retrained 95 people over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
China's tax revenue has been growing at a double-digit rate for
the past few years, and the government is paying increasing
attention to taxes as a major lever for the economy.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's tax revenue increased by 100 billion
yuan over 1997, account for the total value of additional treasury
bonds issued for the year. This revenue played a key role in the
government's policy of stimulating economic growth to offset the
impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji praised the tax system for its efforts to
strengthen administration, close tax loopholes, punish corruption,
and collect overdue taxes.
</P>
<P>
Jin said that the tax system will continue to fight against
corruption.
</P>
<P>
For example, Liang Huaquan, the former head of the National
Taxation Bureau of Jixian county in north China's Hebei Province,
was arrested on Tuesday for involvement in the largest corruption
scandal in the history of New China's tax system. He is charged
with allowing personnel in the tax bureau to divert and embezzle
more than 20 million yuan of tax money in 1997 and 1998.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Report Says Globalization Should Help People, Not Profits (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 Human Development Report
of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), says that
globalization is more than the flow of money and goods and
involves the growing interdependence of the world's people.
</P>
<P>
This offers great opportunities for enriching people's lives
and creating a global community with shared values, it says, but
markets have been allowed to dominate the process and benefits
have not been shared equally.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the UNDP has asked an independent team of experts
every year to report on major issues of global concern and to look
beyond per capita income as a measure of human progress to such
factors as life expectancy, literacy, and overall well-being,
because human development is ultimately a process of increasing
choices in people's lives.
</P>
<P>
This year's report focuses on the positive and negative aspects
of globalization, which is defined not only in economic and
financial terms, but also in terms of technology, culture and
government.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Report Says Globalization Should Help People, Not Profits (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What is happening is a grotesque and dangerous polarization of
people and countries who benefit from the system and those who
receive its effects, the report says, and globalization, as it has
been allowed to go so far, has driven a deeper wedge between the
richer and many poor countries and between people inside countries.
</P>
<P>
It says that the income gap between the richest fifth of the
world's people and the poorest fifth, measured by average national
per capita income, increased from 30-to-1 in 1960 to 74-to-1 in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The inequality of globalization driven by profits is wider and
deeper and touches all aspects of human life, it says. Moreover,
care, which is at the heart of human development, is threatened
today because competitive markets put pressure on time, resources,
and incentives for caring, without which individuals and social
cohesion do not flourish.
</P>
<P>
The global markets grow far faster than measures that govern
them and there are repercussions for people, it says, while
efforts to increase global governance are focus almost entirely on
economic aspects, and human concerns are largely neglected, so all
countries need to guard against its risks and human costs.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Report Says Globalization Should Help People, Not Profit (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, globalization is controllable and changeable, the
report says, and with a commitment by the global community, the
marginalization, human insecurity, and inequality can be overcome
and this can bring far better results in human development.
</P>
<P>
In China, it says, the country's Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
was worth 45.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, ranking number one
among the top five recipients of FDI of developing countries, and
China's Human Development Index (HDI) ranks 98 out of 174 this
year. Its HDI was at 106 last year.
</P>
<P>
It is a measure of a country's achievements in life expectancy,
education, and adjusted real income. The method of determining HDI
has changed so that no immediate and direct comparison can be made
of each country with previous years, the report says.
</P>
<P>
Kerstin Leitner, the resident representative of the UNDP and U.
N. Resident Coordinator in China, said at a release ceremony for
the report that it will serve as an important reference tool for
China's policy makers, scholars, and external development partners.
</P>
<P>
She said she hopes that the report will enliven the debate
about globalization and ensure that it has more of a human face in
the future.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Indonesia Enters New Period of Change, Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The successful general election in
Indonesia held on June 7, during which the opposition Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) obtained a relative majority
vote by beating the three-decade dominant Golkar Party, signals
the world's largest archipelago country is entering a new period
of change and development.
</P>
<P>
According to final election results announced by the General
Election Committee (PPI) Thursday, PDI-P has won 33.73 percent of
the votes, becoming the largest political force in the country.
The ruling Golkar Party, which had won past six elections with
more than 70 percent of the votes in each election, is second with
22.44 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
As many as 48 political parties contended for 462 seats of the
500-member House of Representatives (DPR) in the election, the
first multi-party election in 30 years. The remaining 38 seats are
reserved for the military, whose members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said that the results in favor of the
PDI-P reflected the real aspiration of most Indonesians who have
been thirsting for democratic politics and economy in the country.
</P>
<P>
The PDI-P led by Megawati Soekarno Putri, which broke away from
the original Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) last October, put
up such a good performance in a short time because of its
long-time fight against the New Order regime marked by autocracy
and corruption headed by former president Soeharto who stepped
down in May last year amid the country's worst political and
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
The "anti-status-quo" program put forward by the PDI-P and
other reformist parties in their election campaign won strong
support from different sectors of the society, especially in big
and middle-sized cities in Java, where 60 percent of the total
population live.
</P>
<P>
The previously suppressed reform forces are becoming
increasingly stronger, although the oppressive forces still
persist in maintaining the status quo, observers said.
</P>
<P>
Political experts said the PDI-P could be in lead over the
other 47 parties in the election also because the party has
released a series of policies tallying with the present national
situation. It was repeatedly stated that the party will work to
reinstate the authority of law, carry out the investigation into
the wealth of former president Soeharto and his cronies, and press
ahead with the fight against corruption. The party also held that
the removal of the military's social and political functions
should be done gradually.
</P>
<P>
In the economic field, the PDI-P and some other reform parties
are determined to speed up the economic recovery by stabilizing
the rupiah's exchange rate, reducing the interest rates and
reforming the unhealthy economic structure, especially the
banking system.
</P>
<P>
Following the outbreak of the region's monetary turmoil in
mid-1997, Indonesia became the worst hit, with the rupiah losing
over 70 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
In a situation where the demand for reform is riding high and
the people are paying high credit to the reform forces, the
winning factions including the PDI-P are facing a very good
opportunity to build a new Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts said, they are facing serious challenges of
delivering the many promises they made during the election
campaign. Firstly, the reform forces should make a strong
coalition in the parliament against the Golkar because no party
won a single majority in the election. But it is not easy since
there are different opinions among the parties. Secondly, a clean
and effective government free from corruption, collusion and
nepotism should be established. Thirdly, proper economic policies
should be drawn up to pull the country out of the prolonged
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Political observers and foreign diplomats here said the most
important thing before the future government is to create the
national conciliation in the whole country where riots and
violence have been taking place since May last year. "Without
focusing on this, every effort to empower the people will fail,
because many things could still not be overcome, such as the
environment problem and the people's fear due to the security
situation," an observer noted.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see how the (new) government would raise our status
as a nation facing the challenges of the 21st century," a
legislator said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Trying to Reduce Dependence on Rubber Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is trying
to reduce dependence on rubber imports by making best use of
locally-produced rubber resources, Environment and Forest Minister
Syeda Sajeda Chowdhury said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks while inaugurating a refurbished
display and sales center of the Bangladesh Forest Industries
Development Corporation (BFIDC).
</P>
<P>
He said the government is trying to further develop 15 rubber
plantations to discourage imports.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's rubber farming has a bright prospect since the
climate, chemical components of soil and yearly rate of rainfall
in the northern, northwestern, northeastern and southeastern parts
of the country are favorable for rubber cultivation, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Rubber plantation was first started in Bangladesh in 1955 on an
experimental basis, and a comprehensive program was undertaken in
1975 in the country to attain self-sufficiency in rubber.
</P>
<P>
The present demand for raw rubber in the country is about
30,000 tons a year, and its demand is expected to reach 41,000
tons by the year 2000 and 70,000 tons by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,108 hectares of land has been brought under rubber
plantation since 1987 in the northwestern districts of Tangail and
Rangpur, and another 20,000 hectares of land can be brought under
rubber plantation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The BFIDC can now produce only 3,200 tons of rubber per annum.
As per volume of plantation and age of trees, the yearly
production would be increased to 10,000 tons, BFIDC officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Says Cox Report Won't Affect China's Space Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China's aerospace industry won't
be affected by the "Cox Report" released earlier this year by the
Select Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, which
accuses China of stealing America's "sensitive technology",
according to Zhang Lihui, director of the Research and Development
Department of China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation.
</P>
<P>
China's Long March Carrier Rockets have had 15 successful
launches from October 1996 to June of this year, and the report
can't slow down China's space industry, Zhang said at a State
Council Information Office press conference.
</P>
<P>
The report has, however, jeopardized credibility of China's
space industry and Sino-U.S.trade, Zhang said. But it has also
hardened the determination of Chinese aerospace scientists and
technicians and their confidence in developing China's aerospace
industry independently.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that using Chinese rockets to carry American-made
satellites is making use of space science and technology in a
peaceful way for the welfare of mankind, but that the report has
seriously jeopardized and even stopped this healthy cooperation
and that many Sino-U.S. satellite contracts are on hold.
</P>
<P>
China's space industry has widespread international cooperation
all over Europe, Asia, and Africa and, as far as Zhang knows,
China has very active commercial cooperation with these areas.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Develops Infrastructure to Boost Border Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government plans to spend
three billion baht (81 million U.S. dollars) on developing
infrastructure to boost trade with neighboring countries, a report
of Thailand News Agency said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The budget will be spent on the continuing construction of
roads linking border areas and provinces, as well as
telecommunication and electricity system, which have been
suspended due to financial crunch during the country's economic
crisis, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The investment plan was inspired by official statistics showing
a significant increase in the country's border trade over the
first four months of this year, which reached 225.8 billion baht
(6.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
A study released by the National Economic and Social
Development Board (NESDB) showed that border areas between
Thailand and Myanmar should be developed and promoted for trade
and tourism while those between Thailand and Laos should be
developed for agricultural production and processing, which could
be linked to southern China and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The NESDB study also said that the Thai-Cambodian border should
be developed as a center for investment while the Thai-Malaysian
border should be promoted for trade and tourism.

Actuaries plays an important role in the operation of insurance
firms, which depend on actuaries to statistically calculate risks

</P>
<P>
As China's insurance sector has been growing at an annual rate
of nearly 30 percent in the last decade, the country is in need of
many qualified actuaries. The training of actuaries in China began
only as recently as 1991, and to date there are about 180
graduates qualified to perform this function, according to Zhang

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM Opens Chinese Splendor Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAMILTON, New Zealand, July 15 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime
Minister Jenny Shipley cut the ribbon for Chinese Splendor
Exhibition and officially declared the exhibition open Thursday in
Hamilton, a big city on New Zealand's North Island.
</P>
<P>
The 90 relics on display are selected from 120,000 pieces
housed in the Shanghai Museum. They include ancient bronze
vessels, jade, lacquer ware, porcelain and paintings. The oldest
exhibit is 5,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
Shipley spent more than one hour, watching all the exhibits
with great interest.
</P>
<P>
She told Xinhua that she loves these relics. "They are so old,
but have been preserved so well," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We are indeed lucky to live in an age where the glories of
ancient cultures can be moved around the world and enjoyed by so
many people," she noted.
</P>
<P>
"I am looking forward to visiting China next week, as part of
New Zealand's year as Chair of APEC. Viewing this exhibition will
prepare me well for that," Shipley added.
</P>
<P>
She said that during her China trip, she will exchange views
with Chinese leaders on priorities her country has set for the
forthcoming APEC Leaders' Informal Meeting. She will also discuss
with them ways to expand New Zealand-China bilateral relationship,
especially in trade and tourism.
</P>
<P>
"New Zealand and China are very good friends. Our two countries
have a long history of warm relations," she said.
</P>
<P>
Present at the opening ceremony were Hamilton Mayor Russ
Rimmington, Chinese Consul-General to Auckland Wu Zhuqiu, and over
300 New Zealanders and local overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition at the Waikato Museum of Art and History will
last 12 weeks. Museum Director Jenny Cave told Xinhua that her
museum is honored to display priceless Chinese relics. She
believed the exhibition will serve as a bridge between cultures of
New Zealand and China.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes Ties With PNG Back To Normal (more added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed the hope
that the new government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) will reverse its
predecessor's decision to establish "diplomatic ties" with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Only by so doing can relations between China and Papua New
Guinea be brought back on to a normal track, Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said at a regular press conference here
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China congratulates Mekere Morauta on his
election yesterday as Papua New Guinea's new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
She said China has attached great importance to friendly and
cooperative relations with PNG, adding that since China and PNG
forged diplomatic ties in 1976, their friendly and cooperative
relationship has conformed to the long-term and fundamental
interests of the peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Taiwan has been a part of China from ancient
times and that the People's Republic of China is the sole
legitimate government representing the whole of China, adding that
"the government of PNG made a clear commitment on this when it
established diplomatic ties with China."
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the erroneous decision of the former PNG
leader to sign a so-called communique on the establishment of "
diplomatic ties" with Taiwan has been strongly opposed by the
people of PNG.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin William
Mkapa arrived in Cairo Thursday for a four-day official visit at
the invitation of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak led senior Egyptian officials to greet Mkapa at Cairo
International Airport and the two leaders later held a tete-a-tete
session of talks, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Mkapa will discuss with Mubarak ways of
promoting the bilateral relations, and regional and international
issues of common interest, Tanzanian Ambassador in Cairo Muhamed
Mwinyi Mzale told the news agency Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mzale said that Mkapa's visit "falls within the context of
distinguished and special friendship" binding the two countries'
presidents.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa's visit is aimed at fostering the bilateral relations in
all domains, especially in the economic and trade areas, the
Tanzanian ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Mzale underlined that the visit will provide "a good
opportunity" to the two leaders to take up issues related to the
bilateral ties, foremost of which is to activate the
Tanzanian-Egyptian Joint Committee formed in 1986.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the two countries enjoy historical cooperation
relations and share views vis-a-vis regional and international
issues.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa will reiterate support for Mubarak's efforts to bring
peace to the Middle East and Africa, Mzale said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to sign peace treaty with Israel,
has played a key role in mediating the Arab-Israeli peace talks
since the peace process kicked off in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Cairo is also keen on seeking solutions to raging conflicts on
the African continent, including the civil war in the Democratic
Republic of Congo, Eritrean-Ethiopian border disputes and the
civil war in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Mkapa is expected to meet with Egyptian
businessmen in a bid to encourage them to invest in Tanzania and
promote bilateral trade, the Tanzanian ambassador said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Stock Exchange Resumes Issuing New B-Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Stock Exchange, one
of China's two stock markets, today resumed issuing new B-shares,
the stocks available to overseas investors, after a hiatus of
nearly six months.
</P>
<P>
The Dongbei Electrical Appliances Co. Ltd. based in Huangshi
City in central China's Hubei Province, one of the country's
leading refrigerator compressor producers, became the first new
company to begin issuing B-shares on the exchange in nearly half a
year.
</P>
<P>
The company scheduled an issue of 115 million B-shares on the
Shanghai exchange, 100 million of which were already sold out in
late June, according to an exchange source.
</P>
<P>
The issuing of the Dongbei B-shares brings the total number of
B-shares on the Shanghai stock market to 54.
</P>
<P>
China's B-share market has suffered from a capital shortage and
sustained stagnation since its debut, and declined to its lowest
point last year as a result of the Asian financial crisis and a
lack of confidence among overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Beginning on May 19, however, the Chinese stock market started
to enjoy a bullish run, which led to a strong rebound in B-share
prices.

<HEADLINE> Tourists to Zanzibar Double in 4 Years: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The improvement of
infrastructure facilities and promotional campaigns abroad have
given a strong push to the development of tourism in Zanzibar
isles.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals in Zanzibar, which lies off the east coast of
the mainland Tanzania, have doubled in four years, from 41,433 in
1994 to 86, 445 in 1998, Zanzibari Minister of Information,
Tourism and Youth, Issa Mohammed, has said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the House of Representatives in Zanzibar Wednesday,
the minister said that the tourism sector has witnessed an
encouraging trend particularly with regard to the mushrooming of
first-class hotels.
</P>
<P>
Beds at the hotels increased from 4,210 in 1997 to 4,925 in
1998, Tanzania's major newspaper The Daily News Thursday quoted
Mohammed as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government has taken measures to solve
most of the problems stalling tourism development, such as
improving the transport network and security.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's participation in international exhibitions in
Western countries has greatly publicized the islands, hence
attracting more tourists, he said.

However, he said, tourist arrivals in 1998/99 fiscal year which
ended in June this year slightly dropped by 13 percent primarily
because of the hike in tourist visa fees from 10 U.S. dollars to
40 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, tourism earnings have slightly increased to
138,698 dollars in 1998/99 from 137,920 dollars realized in the
previous year, the minister said.

<P>
Zanzibar, comprising the twin islands of Unguja and Pemba, as
well as a number of smaller islands, is famous for its beaches and
historic sites.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibari government has attached great importance to the
development of tourism, after its major income earner, the exports
of cloves, declined sharply due to fall of the prices of the cash
crop in the international market.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Cypriots to Negotiate Without </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense William
Cohen said here on Thursday that Greek and Turkish Cypriots must
resume talks with no preconditions.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with his Turkish counterpart
Sabahattin Cakmakoglu, Cohen said that the U.S. supports the call
for the solution to the Cyprus issue through direct dialog.
</P>
<P>
Cohen arrived in Ankara Wednesday evening on a one-day visit to
Turkey, part of his six-leg tour which also includes stops in
Greece, Norway, Denmark, Hungary and Albania.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the U.S. supports the call from NATO (North
Atlantic Treaty Organization) General Secretary Javier Solana,
U.N. Security Council and important countries for this direct
dialog," adding that "Washington wants a federation of two
communities and two regions. This is our position."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf denktash declared the
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is now
recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal federation formula, but the talks between
the two sides have made no substantive progress.
</P>
<P>
In his part, Cakmakoglu said that "we state that it is easy for
the Turkish and Greek Cypriot sides to solve the Cyprus issue
under the foundation of equality."
</P>
<P>
"Third party's interference will make the Cyprus issue more
complicated," added the Turkish minister.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimously approved resolution on June 29, the
U.N. Security Council urged U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
invite the Turkish and Greek Cypriot sides to resume talks.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, the talks should start with no
preconditions, all aspects of the conflict be on the table and the
negotiations last until a settlement is reached.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution followed a similar appeal by the G-8,
grouping the U.S., Canada, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Japan
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the G-8 urged Annan "to invite the leaders of
the two parties on Cyprus to negotiations in the fall of 1999."

<P>
SNOW DRAGON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese expedition ship
Snow Dragon with more than 120 scientists and journalists aboard
reached 70 degrees north latitude in the Arctic floating-ice
region today.
</P>
<P>
Floating ice can be seen all around the expedition ship, which
stopped in the Chukchi Sea.
</P>
<P>
Much of the research covering oceanic geology, chemistry, and
biology has already begun, according to Qin Weijia, assistant to
the chief scientist of the expedition.
</P>
<P>
A China-produced helicopter had its first test flight over the
Arctic Ocean today.
</P>
<P>
The team members of the expedition are divided into three
groups encompassing the atmosphere, sea ice, and the ocean. The
present good weather is most favorable to the studies, according
to Qin.
</P>
<P>
During their two week voyage since leaving Shanghai at the
beginning of this month, scientists have collected aerosol and
carbon dioxide samples, and oceanic temperature observations and
fishery resources exploration have also been conducted.
</P>
<P>
The expedition ship is scheduled to stop more than 20 times for
various scientific studies in the Chukchi Sea in the next ten days,
before heading further north to a latitude of 80 degrees.
</P>
<P>
Following that, some team members will be transported by
helicopter to an ice region further north, according to chief
expedition scientist Chen Liqi.
</P>
<P>
This is Chinese scientists' first expedition to the North Pole,
where they will study the effect of the North Pole on the global
climate, especially on China, the ecological system in Arctic
waters, and the atmosphere, geology, fishing, and marine
environment of the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior French official has said
that there is great potential for France and China to cooperate in
agricultural research.
</P>
<P>
Claude Bernet, General Director for Education and Research in
the Agricultural Ministry of France, said Wednesday that both
France, the world's largest farm-produce processing country, and
China, the world's most populous country, are facing the problem
of improving the quality of agricultural products and protecting
the environment.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the two nations can be significant despite
their climatic and cultural differences said Bernet, who is now in
Kunming, the capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province, to
participate in the '99 Kunming World Horticulture Exposition.
</P>
<P>
Bernet expressed the hope that long-term and regular exchanges
of technical personnel will be conducted between China and France.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, about 20 French agricultural research institutions
have established ties with Chinese research institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The French National Institute for Research in Agronomy and Food
Industry has trained hundreds of researchers for China, and some
40 Chinese scientists are now receiving training or working at the
institute, which has had a cooperative relationship with China for
20 years.
</P>
<P>
According to Philippe Ferlin, director of the institute's
International Relations Department, later this year the institute
will sponsor a project aimed at preventing orange and tangerine
tree diseases.

ISLAMABAD, July 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 51,000 Afghan refugees
have returned home from Pakistan in the past six months, reports

</P>
<P>
Niaz Ahmed, spokesman for the United Nations High Commission
for Refugees (UNHCR) based in Peshawar, capital of Pakistan's

Ahmed said that they are assisting those who really want to
return home and will continue to do so in future.

Once those refugees reach Afghanistan, there are other agencies

<HEADLINE> Ulster Unionist Party Absent from N. Irish Assembly Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The key Ulster Unionist Party (UUP)
on Thursday did not attend the session of the Northern Ireland
Assembly scheduled to set up a new power-sharing executive for the
British province.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Protestant leader David Trimble said his
Ulster Unionist Party would not nominate ministers at the session.
</P>
<P>
Trimble made the announcement to a news conference in Belfast
15 minutes before the assembly of Catholics and Protestants was to
convene, dashing hopes of a last-minute solution to a crisis over
IRA disarmament, that has brought the Good Friday peace agreement
to a halt.
</P>
<P>
The assembly started shortly after Trimble's announcement
without any of the 28 UUP members present, according to a Reuters
report filed from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said his UUP planned to set up a "shadow administration
" and urged British authorities to revoke the session as soon as
possible so that the peace process could be "parked" and discussed
further.
</P>
<P>
Thursday was the deadline set by British Prime Minister Tony
Blair for the assembly to meet to decide ministerial posts, which
are to be shared among Protestant Unionist and Catholic
Nationalist politicians, according to earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to work constructively with the other parties
to ensure that we achieve the creation of a genuinely democratic
government in Northern Ireland," Trimble was quoted as saying.

BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China and ASEAN nations would
conduct "friendly and in-depth" exchange of views on the fresh
changes in international and regional situation, as well as the
development of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue told a press conference here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on China's anticipation on the 6th ASEAN
Regional Forum in Singapore later this month, Zhang said China
hopes that the forum would continue to proceed in a healthy
direction on the basis of equal participation, consultation and
progressing step by step.
</P>
<P>
China maintains that international norms, including the purpose
and guidelines of the UN Charter, should be emphasized under the
current international situation, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the upcoming ARF would discuss the issue of South China
Sea, Zhang said that the issue should be settled through bilateral
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
China has always opposed discussing the South China Sea issue
on international occasions and China disagrees that the non-
related countries get involved in this issue, Zhang stated.
</P>
<P>
It would only make a bilateral issue more complicated if the
issue is internationalized, Zhang said, adding that China does not
think the ARF is an appropriate occasion to discuss the issue
concerning the South China Sea.

<HEADLINE> Water Runs High at Middle Reaches of Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The second flood crest of the
Yangtze River, China's longest, has haunted this central Chinese
city for more than four days, with the average water level being
monitored at 27.7 meters.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the second flood peak reached Wuhan,
capital of central China's Hubei Province, in the early morning of
July 11, and since then the water level has been running above 27.
7 meters. At 8 am today, the water level was monitored at 27.80
meters, and showed no sign of receding.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jun, a water control expert from the Yangtze River Water
Conservancy Committee, blamed the continuing high water level on
the constant rain in the valley of the upper reaches of the
Yangtze and the ongoing water surge from upstream.
</P>
<P>
Though the water level in the main stream of the Yangtze is
running high, the pressure on the fortified embankments along both
banks of the river in Wuhan is not too great at present.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze divides Wuhan into three parts: Hankou, the
business district, Hanyang, a comparatively poor district, and
Wuchang, the district of universities and government organizations.
</P>
<P>
As the second flood peak has been passing, the water level has
been at about four meters above the ground in the urban areas of
Wuhan. Nevertheless, local residents are remaining calm in the
face of the rising water levels.
</P>
<P>
Flooding caused by heavy rainfall along the Yangtze River
Valley since late June has killed more than 200 people and
threatened the lives of 60 million local people.

<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- An air route from the city of
Zhangjiajie in central China's Hunan Province to Macao will be
opened on Saturday, Mayor Lu Pingyi of Zhangjiajie announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
On that day, a chartered plane will fly from Zhangjiajie to
Macao, Lu said at a press conference for the '99 China Ecological
Zhangjiajie Hunan International Forest Protection Festival to be
held in Zhangjiajie September 22 to 27.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new flight route will further facilitate
overseas tourism in Zhangjiajie, adding that he expected more than

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Malaysia to Set Up Joint Gas Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Thai authorities approved a key
natural gas project between Thailand and Malaysia, which is
expected to benefit the two neighboring countries, the Thai News
Agency (TNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 1.03-billion-U.S. dollar Trans Thailand-Malaysia Pipeline
and Natural Gas Separation Plant Joint Venture Project, proposed
by the Thai state-run Petroleum Authority of Thailand (PTT), will
be a 50-50 joint venture between PTT and Petronas, Malaysia's
national oil company, TNA said.
</P>
<P>
The TTM joint venture would build gas pipeline linking gas
fields in the joint development area of the two countries, between
the South of Thailand and the North of Malaysia, to a two-unit
natural gas separation plant in Thailand's southern province of
Songkhla.
</P>
<P>
The project would benefit the Thai economy in form of natural
resource utilization and the stabilization of the energy sector,
TNA said.
</P>
<P>
The project, to be given investment privileges from the Board
of Investment (BOI), would also help promote downstream
industries, including electricity plants and petrochemical
industry in Thailand's five southern provinces, the news agency
added.

<P>
LONDON, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Ulster Unionists Wednesday night spurned a last-minute
attempt by British Prime Minister Tony Blair to persuade them to
back his blueprint for peace in Northern Ireland. The Unionists
insisted that they could not form an executive with Sinn Finn
without prior IRA decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The European Commission Wednesday fined British Airways for
operating anti-competitive loyalty schemes with travel agents and
warned other airlines they would face similar penalties if they
did not stop such practices.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The European Commission announced Wednesday that the
worldwide ban on exports of British beef will end on August 1. But
the initial euphoria among Britain's farmers faded rapidly as it
became clear that very little beef will be exported initially.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain and Argentina made their boldest move yet towards
reconciliation over the Falklands Wednesday, re-establishing an
air link to the mainland and agreeing that all Argentineans could
visit the disputed islands for the first time since the 1982 war.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The British government has abandoned plans to use taxpayers'
money to push for a "yes" vote in a euro referendum following
pressure from the standards watchdog.

<HEADLINE> Metro Manila Gets Intelligent Traffic Lights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to ease the worsening
traffic condition of the capital region, the Philippine government
has installed "intelligent" traffic lights in 90 out of the 444
intersections in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Godofredo Galano, director of the Traffic Engineering Center,
said Thursday that these Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic
System (SCATS) signals are in addition to the 50 "signaled"
intersections already existing in the region.
</P>
<P>
These "intelligent" traffic lights are controlled by
underground sensors that can detect which lane is jammed with
vehicles and then activate the green light for that lane much
longer, Galano said.
</P>
<P>
Galano noted that Metro Manila's present traffic control
system, which was started in 1978, has already surpassed its
threshold of efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"Its fixed time system, which is based on 1981 traffic data,
can no longer cope with or respond accurately and instantly to
present situations," he said.
</P>
<P>
SCATS, whose software is owned by the government of New South
Wales in Australia, is described by its sellers as a sophisticated
system that could reduce stops by at least 40 percent, cut travel
time by 20 percent, and fuel consumption by 12 percent.

<P>
PARIS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In his traditional speech on the National Day on Wednesday,
French President Jacques Chirac rejected the suggestion by former
President Giscard d'Estaing that he shorten his presidential term
from seven years to five years. He also called on the right-wing
opposition parties to stop quarreling and said the balance sheet
of his political coalition with Socialist Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin is positive.
</P>
<P>
-- African leaders failed to adopt a Nigeria-sponsored plan to
establish a system of group security on the continent haunted by
wars, as the summit of the Organization for African Unity (OAU)
ended on Wednesday in Algiers after three days of session focused
on preventing conflicts. Outgoing president of OAU, Burkina Faso's
president Blaise Compaore, gave a somber summary of the situation
in Africa before handing over his seat to Algerian President
Abdelaziz Bouteflika, the host of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The summit of OAU gave a surprising statement when it ended
on Wednesday in Algiers: "Coup d'Etat will no longer be tolerated.
" The OAU will not recognize from now anyone who takes power by
force, said the 38 leaders present at the summit, 21 of whom came
to power by arms -- either coup d'etat or war of liberation.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.N. Civil Administrator to Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, is
due to arrive in Pristina on Thursday. Charged with re-
establishing the institutions, infrastructures and administration
in Kosovo, Kouchner has as his prior task to make ethnic Albanian
and Serb officials work together.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Formulates IT Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Nepalese government has
formulated a three-way plan to develop information technology to
match the growth in the world, a National Planning Commission
(NPC) official said.
</P>
<P>
NPC member Shankar Sharma told Xinhua in a recent interview
that the plan includes software development, human resources
development and the establishment of an information technology
park.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that there are about 10 software developing
centers in Nepal but software export is very low.
</P>
<P>
"We have expected that Nepal can export about 60 billion rupees
(882 million U.S. dollars) of software per year within 20 years,
so we're making plans accordingly and working to achieve the
goal," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We can do that if we develop qualified manpower in this age of
global village," he added with confidence.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Sharma said that under the government's plan, two types of
manpower -- software developer and software operator -- will be
developed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a first sum of 10 million rupees (147,058 dollars)
has been allocated for the establishment of an information
technology park in Kathmandu, he said, adding that the park is
expected to be completed in two years.
</P>
<P>
Under the Foreign Direct Investment Act, both private and
foreign investors are encouraged to be involved in the development
of information technology in Nepal, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that thanks to foreign aid, his country is much
computerized, but computers have not been used properly.
</P>
<P>
Now there are only three Internet service providers in the
Himalayan kingdom with some 15,000 Internet users, and in terms of
electronic commerce, only a small project is being run by the
Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the
Ministry of Commerce, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the government is planning to introduce computers in
the government-run schools to expand their use, he said. Private
schools have computer courses.
</P>
<P>
"From the next educational calendar, we will start computer
courses in some government schools and establish computer training
centers specially for school teachers and other government and
semi-government officials from the next fiscal year (starting in
mid-July)," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We also encourage the use of the Intranet among school
teachers and students. This will be started in universities," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"There is a plan of establishing telecenters in all the five
development regions immediately with a view to providing
interconnection facilities to government offices and
organizations," he disclosed.
</P>
<P>
On the constraints Nepal is facing in developing information
technology, Dr. Sharma said that the regulations will be amended
and a cyber law will be formulated to address problems like
unavailability of loans, letter of credit and foreign exchange to
companies in this sector.
</P>
<P>
A high-level committee will be formed soon under the
chairmanship of the NPC vice chairman to clear the way for better
development of information technology in the country, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Pressure Mounts on Nigeria's Speaker to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Serious pressure has been mounted on
Nigeria' s Speaker of the House of Representative Alhaji Ibrahim
Buhari to resign in order to save the image of the country's
nascent democracy.
</P>
<P>
The presidency and the Senate have been worried about the
negative reactions from the allegations against the Speaker since
Sunday when the weekly News magazine hit the streets with the
cover story titled "The Face of a Liar..."
</P>
<P>
The News magazine in its current issue alleged that Buhari lied
about his age and claimed educational qualifications he did not
have.
</P>
<P>
The magazine quoted an official of Toronto University of Canada
as saying that at no time did the Speaker attend the university
contrary to his claim.
</P>
<P>
The magazine further alleged that the Speaker is 29 years old
and not 36 as he claimed. The import of this is that he was not
qualified to stand for election into the House of Representatives
as the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria provides that anybody aspiring
to the National Assembly must be at least 30 years.

where he attended the 35th Summit of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) Wednesday met with five senators from each of all
three political parties on the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Because of the meeting, the Senate could only sit for ten
minutes before it adjourned till Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of various party leaders held Wednesday was said to
have resolved that the only way out of the "embarrassing
situation" was for Buhari "to vacate his office".
</P>
<P>
The Senate has set up a 16-man committee in one of its shortest
sittings to investigate the allegations because it considered the
allegations as "a matter of urgent national importance."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Buhari told the National Assembly that "I wish to
assure you that there is no truth in the story" carried by the
News magazine.
</P>
<P>
He described the allegations of forgery and falsehood levelled
against him as unfounded, adding that the campaign to smear his
reputation is one of the "prices I have to pay for democracy."
</P>
<P>
The Independent Communications Network Limited, publishers of
the News magazine, has challenged the House speaker to go to court
as it refused to apologize as demanded by the speaker's counsel,
Chief Rotimi Williams.
</P>
<P>
The magazine disclosed that it had more than sufficient
evidence to establish that Buhari had no reputation worthy of
protecting by any properly constituted court of law in Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Botha Implicated in Killings: TRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president P. W. Botha has been named by the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) as one of those "implicated" in
killings of activists in the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement from the TRC on Thursday, former
apartheid hit squad commander Eugene De Kock and eleven other
apartheid security policemen will appear before the amnesty
committee next Monday for their role in the murder of eight United
Democratic Front youth activists on the East Rand in 1985.
</P>
<P>
According to some of the applicants, the operation was approved
by cabinet ministers, including then state president Botha.
</P>
<P>
TRC spokesman Mbulelo Sompeta said the TRC would convey its
findings to South Africa's prosecuting authorities, which would
decide whether to investigate the findings further and prosecute
anyone.
</P>
<P>
"Implicated persons" were normally notified of their status by
the TRC, Sompeta said, and it was up to them whether they wanted
to attend a hearing or send a lawyer on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
Botha's previous encounter with the TRC ended with him winning
his Cape High Court appeal last month against a conviction for
defying a subpoena to testify before the TRC.
</P>
<P>
The notification to Botha to testify before the commission was
technically invalid, the court said.

<HEADLINE> Meeting for Selecting New WTO Director-General Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from the members of
the World Trade Organization (WTO) postponed a meeting scheduled
for Thursday morning designed for the selection of the new WTO
director-general.
</P>
<P>
No new date was immediately available after the ambassadors of
Bangladesh and Australia called for the delay, the Bangladeshi
envoy Istekhar Chowdhury told reporters.
</P>
<P>
There had been a draft proposal that the two candidates,
Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand and Mike Moore of New Zealand,
would serve a three-year term one after another. Both candidates
have indicated they would accept the "3+3" plan.
</P>
<P>
"We thought a postponement would help because this is a subject
of intense consultations and many delegations are seeking
instructions from their governments," said Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
If the 134 members of the WTO could reach consensus on the
proposal, the first of the two candidates would take up his three-
year post as early as from September 1.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the United States backed the idea, U.S. Trade
Ambassador Rita Hayes said the plan was "one of many proposals out
there" and the United States would look at it "as it has looked at
all draft proposals."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Agency Expects Long Spell of Hunger in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenya may experience a long spell
of hunger following a decline in maize output in the main rainy
season in 1999, the United States Agency for International
Development has warned in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report, dubbed "Kenya Vulnerability Update", available here
Thursday, said that only 1.83 million tons of maize will be
harvested after poor performance of the long rains from March to
June, about a shortfall of 0.4 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"The output compares unfavorably with the 1991-97 average
long-rains output of 2.16 million tons and to last year's
long-rains output of 2.23 million tons," the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The decline attributes the situation to unusually low and
poorly- distributed rainfall in all parts of the country with the
exception of the areas adjacent to Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
Less than normal cumulative rainfall during the 1999 long rains
season had promoted degeneration of vegetation even in the
high-potential districts in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The report added that "the poor vegetative conditions are
expected to continue for next several months in eastern and
northern Kenya since the short rains are not expected until
October."
</P>
<P>
A rapid assessment by Famine Early Warning System and the
Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture in the "bread basket districts" in
Rift Valley Province in central Kenya, revealed unusually poor
conditions.
</P>
<P>
In the five districts in Rift Valley, it is expected that
747,975 tons of maize would be harvested compared to 896,607 tons
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report said that bean output for the 1999 long rains season
will be 185, 235 tons, representing a 40 percent reduction of the
expected production relative to the 1991-97 average output of
310,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The worst hit areas, the report pointed out, are the pastoral
districts in North Eastern Province and the absence of rainfall
during June has accelerated the depletion of water, pasture and
browse.
</P>

administers the U. S. foreign assistance program providing
economic and humanitarian assistance in more than 80 countries

<P>
LUSAKA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- France has urged rebels fighting to
topple President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) to sign the cease-fire agreement inked by all heads of
states of the belligerent nations in Lusaka last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
French Ambassador to Zambia Jean-Louis Zoel said on the
occasion marking the French National Day which falls on July 14
that rebels in the DRC should sign the cease-fire accord without
any further procrastination.
</P>
<P>
The Times of Zambia newspaper Thursday quoted the ambassador as
saying that further delay in signing would worsen the destruction
and devastation to the people of the DRC and the Great Lakes
region.
</P>
<P>
Zoel said that Zambian President Frederick Chiluba's initiative
to bring warring parties to a negotiating table was a valuable
achievement.
</P>
<P>
"Getting the warring parties to the same table and having them
talking directly to each other was quite an achievement, very
valuable in itself," he said.
</P>
<P>
"France highly commends the mediation conducted tirelessly and
with unwavering dedication by Zambia and President Chiluba, on
behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) to put
an end to the conflict in the DRC," he added.

BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman said here today that Lee Teng-hui's remarks will
undoubtedly seriously obstruct the improvement of ties between the
two sides across the Taiwan Straits, affect the stability of the
situation in the Taiwan Straits and jeopardize the peaceful
reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Taiwan authorities had defined the cross-
Straits relations as "state-to-state, or at least special state-to-
state relations" is an out-and-out negation of and serious
provocation against the universally-recognized "one China"
principle, spokeswomen Zhang Qiyue said at a routine press
conference this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"It has further exposed his (Lee's) political nature of
deliberately dividing the Chinese territory and sovereignty in an
attempt to separate Taiwan from China," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"Lee takes an extremely dangerous step on the separatist road,"
she said.

occur in areas off the east coastal of south China's Guangdong
Province on July 10, which was extended to some 10 sq km by

</P>
<P>
This is the first tide occur in waters off the province this

</P>
<P>
From October 1997 to January 1998, extensive red tide occurred
over Zhelin Bay, the same waters at this time of the year, and it
has been twice caused by algae of the same category, which led to
huge losses for local fishery by producing toxins detrimental to
the survival of fish.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, no death of fish has been reported so far at this
initial stage in the water space where aquiculture is located. And
the density of red tide is forecasted to extend steadily and the
tide will possibly disappear in three to four days.
</P>
<P>
Local oceanic administration has sent special teams of
technicians to monitor the situation and make investigations on

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Signs Air Services Transit Agreement with Kyrgyz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) signed an Air Services Transit
Agreement with the Kyrgyz Republic Thursday, the third such
agreement signed by the HKSAR since July 1, 1997, following
similar agreements with the Maldives and Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Ip, secretary for Economic Services of the HKSAR, and
Alik Askarov, deputy of the Minister of Transport and
Communications and director of the Department of Air Traffic and
Air Space Use of the Kyrgyz Republic, signed the agreement on
behalf of their governments.
</P>
<P>
"The Agreement today marks a new chapter in the development of
the  bilateral civil aviation relations between the HKSAR and the
Kyrgyz
Republic," said Ip at the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly believe that these bilateral relations will
develop in time, and will continue to provide a firm foundation
for the further growth of other economic ties between the two
places," he added.
</P>
<P>
An air services transit agreement facilitates the development
of  international air services by providing a legal framework
which enables
the airlines of both sides to use the most direct and
cost-effective
flight paths which go over the air space of the other side in
operating
international services.
</P>
<P>
Acting under specific authorizations from the Central People's
Government of China, the government of the HKSAR will continue to

<HEADLINE> Singapore Sees Increasing Older Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore employers have to
rethink their attitudes towards employing older workers in face of
an increasingly aging population, said the Ministry of Manpower in
an occasional paper issued Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Last year, people aged 55 and above accounted for 14 percent,
or about 451,900, of Singapore's resident population, the paper on
"older workers" revealed.
</P>
<P>
The figure will increase to 27 percent or some 1,124,200 by the
year 2000, thus incurring a significant impact on the labor force,
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
"Older workers represent a valuable resource that we can ill
afford to waste," said the paper. "Employers have to rethink their
attitude towards employing older workers and make necessary
adjustments to facilitate their continued employment.
</P>
<P>
It said that Singapore, as other developed countries like Japan
and the United States, has taken such measures as extending
retirement age, reducing the cost of hiring older workers and
re-training and skill-upgrading of older workers.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted that while various measures can contribute to
the continued employment of older workers, their success hinges on
employers changing their attitudes so as not to base employment
decisions on pre-conceived ideas about age.
</P>
<P>
Relative to younger workers, older workers in Singapore are
more vulnerable to job loss and longer unemployment spells, said
the paper.
</P>
<P>
This is because of the higher cost of hiring older workers and
the perception among some employers that they are less productive
and receptive to new ideas, it added.
</P>
<P>
But studies have shown that older workers could perform better
in many jobs, especially those involving service and human contact
such as retail, counseling, social services and consultancy, it
said.
</P>
<P>
They can maintain high levels of performance well into their
50s and 60s in jobs that require much training and experience such
as professional and highly-technical work.
</P>
<P>
"As Singapore moves towards a knowledge-based economy, age may
become less important than skills in sustaining employment," said
the paper.
</P>
<P>
"There is considerable scope for employers to use flexible work
options to allow older persons a more gradual transition from
full-time to retirement enabling them to stay longer in the
workforce," it said.
</P>
<P>
The paper found that among older men in Singapore, only 65
percent were in the labor force last year, compared to at least 80
percent in Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The same trend holds true for older women in Singapore, of
which 22 percent worked last year, as opposed to 50 percent in
Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
On their education profile, the paper noted that older workers
will increasingly be better educated.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, more than half of them would have at least secondary
education and by 2020 the figure will increase further to
two-thirds, the paper forecast.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Mining Workers Get 43 PC Salary Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's mining industry, which
is under threat from poor international commodity prices and
rising production costs, has agreed to award a 43 percent salary
increase to its workers with effect from this month.
</P>
<P>
The increase was agreed between the Chamber of Mines and
Associated Mineworkers of Zimbabwe, the daily Herald reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Chamber of Mines David Murangari said
Wednesday that the mining sector has had to bend backwards after
taking into consideration the harsh economic environment, which
has adversely affected both the workers and companies.
</P>
<P>
"The mining industry is also facing a threat in (falling) gold
prices because of the gold sales made by Britain and the proposed
gold sale by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Murangari described the gold sales by Britain and the proposed
sale by the IMF as irresponsible, noting that their actions would
worsen the price of gold, which is currently at its 20-year low.
</P>
<P>
About 82,000 jobs could be lost in South Africa and over
100,000 in the sub-Saharan region if gold prices stay below 260
U.S. dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
Gold prices declined to around 257 dollars an ounce after
Britain sold 25 tons in an auction.

<HEADLINE> China Unveils First High-Tech Development Guide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ten industries that are covered by the listed areas include
agriculture, information, environmental protection and
comprehensive use of resources, medicine, energy, communications,
materials, machine building, construction, and light and textile
industry.
</P>
<P>
The guide, published Wednesday, is jointly compiled by the
State Development Planning Commission (SDPC) and the Ministry of
Science and Technology, and will be revised on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
A SDPC official said that with the guide the government wants
to encourage the whole nation to contribute to accelerating high-
tech development with possible resources in a bid to promote the
current economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
All high-tech projects that meet the requirements of the guide
will be supported by the government by means of reducing or
exempting equipment import tariffs, and offering preferential
loans and state investments, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that attention should be paid to avoiding redundant
projects, calling on enterprises, financial institutions and
governments at all levels to choose projects according to their
own conditions.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC is now working with departments concerned on setting
up a high-tech project database to provide consulting services to
local governments and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech sector has just begun to develop in China and
lags far behind leading developed countries in the world in terms
of scale, level and competitiveness. Preliminary statistics show
that the added value of the high-tech sector contributes less than
two percent of China's gross domestic product.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 15 (Xinhua) -- There may be 50,000 drug
addicts in Kuwait, according to estimates by a British specialists
team at Kuwait's Psychological Disease Hospital.
</P>
<P>
David Mathews, a member of the team who arrived here three
years ago, said the estimation was based on the number of drug
addicts treated by the hospital each year, local English daily
Arab Times reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Mathews, between 5,000 and 6,000 addicts visit the
hospital every year. International standards suggest that only 10
percent of the "problem cases" ever come to light.
</P>
<P>
"We are only seeing a fraction," Mathews said.
</P>

Unlike before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990, when
alcohol was the drug of choice, today it is heroine that prevails,

KAMPALA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- A new study carried out in Uganda
has revealed that Nevirapine drug can reduce HIV transmission from

<HEADLINE> China Willing to Cooperate with APEC on Gov't Procurement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to keep close
cooperation with members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) organization and other parts of the world in a bid to
achieve progress in government procurement.
</P>
<P>
China will adopt a positive attitude toward the establishment
of an open, transparent government procurement system that allows
competition in operation, according to a trade official at the
ongoing APEC Workshop on Government Procurement Practices which
opened Wednesday in Kunming, capital of Yunnan Province in
southwest China.
</P>
<P>
China began to adopt on a trial basis internationally-accepted
practice for government procurement in 1995, and the experiment
has spread from the pioneer city of Shanghai to 28 other provinces,
autonomous regions and cities. Now in China procurement for big
projects financed by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank
and foreign governments is done through international bidding.
</P>
<P>
To legalize it, China's top legislature, the National People's
Congress (NPC), has listed the stipulation of a government
procurement law a top priority, according to Chi Haibin, a NPC
Standing Committee member.
</P>
<P>
Investigations are underway for the promulgation of the law to
promote the country's economic development, said Chi, who is also
a member of the NPC Financial and Economic Committee and the law's
drafting team.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that Chinese government administrative
institutions spend 700 billion yuan (84 billion U.S. dollars) on
procurement every year. The enactment of a procurement law is
expected to save as much as 80 billion yuan (9.64 billion U.S.
dollars) in annual expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The five-day workshop has attracted representatives and experts
from 14 APEC nations, and the participants will discuss the future
development of government procurement and cooperation between APEC
members in this field, as well as the impact of the World Trade
Organization on this matter.

<HEADLINE> Latvian President Returns Controversial Language bill to Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Latvian President Vaira Vike-
Freiberga has returned a controversial language bill to parliament
for revision, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved by the parliament last Thursday, prompted
concern from neighboring Russia and international organizations
for its perceived discrimination against minority rights.
</P>
<P>
It mandates the use of the Latvian language at most public
functions and in business, even those involving only Russian
speakers, who account for 40 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
"If we took the road to Europe, we should prove our ability to
harmonize our laws with European norms," the president said in a
special television program announcing her decision late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no sense in making clothes with drawbacks in the
belief that they will be patched later," Vike-Freiberga said. "It
is better to mend holes right away or to sew something new, and
then appear before the public."
</P>
<P>
However, Vike-Freiberga stressed, "the key aim of the law --
to protect the Latvian language -- remains intact and is not
subject to revision."
</P>
<P>
The same mistake should not be repeated in the future and it
is necessary to hold thorough consultations with international
experts and local specialists, Vike-Freiberga said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Maps out Malaria Control Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Ministry of Health has
developed a national plan on malaria control in the wake of
criticism from the media and parliament, the East African Standard
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The plan aims at reducing morbidity and mortality from malaria
through flexible and sustainable strategies, director of Medical
Services Julius Meme has said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry is set to terminate the use of
chloroquine as the main drug in combating malaria since it has
been proved to be no longer effective.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Medical Association was challenged Wednesday to give
a full report over premature discharge of patients at a Kisii
district hospital in Kenya's Southwest Nyanza Province before
President Daniel arap Moi's visit last Monday so as to give a
false impression.
</P>
<P>
In the past four months, 700 Kenyans reportedly died of
malaria, a tropical disease and top killer in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Local officials in Kisii district claimed that the Health
Ministry has banned the media coverage of the state of malaria
spread.

<HEADLINE> Manila Takes Preventive Measures Against Dengue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- With the dreaded dengue fever
likely to strike at the onset of the rainy season, the Philippine
government has started taking preventive steps to prevent a
possible outbreak of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Romualdez Jr., secretary of the Department of Health
(DOH), said Thursday morning that his office has mobilized local
governments nationwide to keep tabs on the so-called "dengue hot
spots."
</P>
<P>
"Dengue downed many people last year. This year, we will keep a
close watch over it," Romualdez said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
The DOH, he said, is putting on the fast track its system of
drug procurement to make sure hospitals and local government
health centers have the needed medicines to combat dengue.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez said the DOH and local governments would remain on
alert against dengue until November, when the rainy season is
expected to subside.
</P>
<P>
"The dengue season is long, it lasts up to November. We should
stay alert until then to prevent the situation from worsening," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to Romualdez, the DOH has noted some cases of dengue
in Nueva Ecija Province in the central Philippines, but local
health authorities acted quickly and prevented the disease from
spreading.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez added that the DOH is also on the lookout for other
diseases that usually strike during the rainy season.
</P>
<P>
Such diseases, he said, include upper respiratory tract
infections due to sudden changes in weather conditions. This
disease often kills children below five years old, he said.
</P>
<P>
To combat this, Romualdez said, the DOH is now conducting
health education classes to advise parents on how to prevent their
children from getting infected.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Fresh fighting that broke out on
Wednesday between Sri Lankan government troops and Tamil rebels
left nine rebels and three soldiers killed in the north of the
country, the Defense Ministry said Thursday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The troops destroyed a rebel bunker with grenades and machine
guns north of Kalyanapura, killing five rebels, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
However, three soldiers were killed as the rebels retaliated
with mortars, it said.
</P>
<P>
The troops on Wednesday also killed three rebels in two other
separate clashes in the Jaffna area.
</P>
<P>
The troops sniped and killed another rebel in the Wanni area,
it added.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, a bomb set off by Tamil rebels killed two
civilians and injured 28 others including five police personnel in
Batticaloa, 300 kilometers east of Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The blast came as security forces and police remained on red
alert against Tamil rebels' attacks at a time when the rebels were
celebrating the 12th anniversary of their first suicide bomb
attack.
</P>
<P>
Tamil rebels have been battling the Sri Lankan government since
1983 for a homeland for Tamil minorities in the north and east of
the country.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Urges Fight Against Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has urged church leaders to work with his government to combat
corruption, immorality and other social ills in the country.
</P>
<P>
Moi said his government had intensified the fight against graft
and appealed to the clergy to join hands to wipe out the vice, the
mass media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks Wednesday as he opened a
four-day Unity for Africa Peace and Prayer Conference in Lake
Victoria city of Kisumu, in southwestern Nyanza Province.
</P>
<P>
Moi noted that church had a moral duty to encourage good
lifestyle by creating awareness among the youth on how to guard
against such vices as drug addiction and irresponsible sex
behaviors.
</P>
<P>
On peace and unity in Africa, the president told the
participants that the two were vital ingredients for social and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted with dismay that in most parts of the world,
the search for peace had been shadowed by the pursuit of narrow
selfish interests.
</P>
<P>
In Africa in particular, conflicts and wars continued to take
place with increasing frequency, causing immense suffering and
death each year, the president added.
</P>
<P>
Moi said Kenya was fortunate to have been spared from such
turmoil and upheavals that afflict many countries in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the conference organizers for initiating
discussions at finding solutions to common problems.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Abide by Congo (K) Truce Pact: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has reiterated that it
would abide by the terms of the cease-fire agreement signed in
Lusaka last week.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean High Commissioner to Zambia Tirivaffi Kangai said
here Wednesday that Zimbabwe, which is one of the major parties
involved in the 11-month conflict in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), was committed to the agreement by virtue of President
Robert Mugabe appending his signature to the pact.
</P>
<P>
"It is indeed our hope and expectation that all the other
signatories to that agreement will equally, fully respect and
adhere to what they have signed," Kangai was quoted by Thursday's
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said hopes of peace in the DRC were high and there would be
great disappointment in the region and beyond, if the cease-fire
agreement was not respected by even a single signatory.
</P>
<P>
Kangai saidZimbabwe together with other Southern African
Development Community (SADC) member states were still deployed
within the DRC. He said the withdrawal of all forces was scheduled
to be completed within 180 days of the signing of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Military Commission (JMC) would in full consultation
with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the United
Nations, draw up the detailed schedule for definitive withdrawal
of foreign forces from the DRC, he added.

<HEADLINE> Habibie Says He'll Support Megawati if She's Elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
will welcome Megawati Soekarnoputri, leader of the Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), as new president if the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) elects her in the upcoming
session.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Minister of Justice/State Secretary Muladi
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"If 700 members of the MPR, most of them elect Megawati (to be
president) constitutionally, it means God want her being
president. People have to support her," Muladi said before
attending a hearing with the House of Representatives Commission I
on law and foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
Muladi, however, said that in vice versa situation, if the MPR
elects incumbent president Habibie, he has the support from the
people.
</P>
<P>
"Just let the members of the MPR make decision," Muladi added.
</P>
<P>
In a weekend interview with Singapore's Straits Times newspaper
in Jakarta, Habibie said he would accept Megawati, daughter of
Indonesia's founding president Soekarno, as president if the MPR
appointed her.
</P>
<P>
"If people want to have her, then I will accept it because I
have full confidence that the people will take the best," The
Indonesian Observer Thursday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The contest for the presidency will be decided by the MPR,
which incorporates the 500-member parliament and 200 provincial
and community appointees. Habibie, who has been nominated for the
presidency by the ruling Golkar Party, is in competition with
Megawati.
</P>
<P>
The MPR, the country's highest decision-making body, will meet
in November to elect the country's next president.

granted the right and are now competing with state-owned companies
in foreign trade.

<HEADLINE> Iran Discovers Powerful Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces on
Wednesday discovered a powerful bomb on the Mullah Sadra Avenue in
northwestern Tehran and defused it.
</P>
<P>
"The bomb was very powerful and could have inflicted heavy
losses if exploded," an informed source told local daily Tehran
Times published on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The source also said that the security source also discovered a
hideout used by terrorists in Tehran, but gave no details.
</P>
<P>
The discoveries coincided with a massive rally in Tehran
University against unrest caused by student protests to police
crackdown.
</P>
<P>
Over the past week, Iran experienced the worst unrest since the
1979 Islamic revolution as security forces clashed with protesting
students following an unauthorized police crackdown on the Tehran
University dormitory complex on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The police assault, a response to a student rally protesting
against the approval of new press law and the closure of the
leading moderate daily Salam (Hello), was widely condemned in the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian leaders blasted "foreign and domestic enemies"
for being behind the unrest and warned the students of the "black
hands of the enemies."
</P>
<P>
The pro-conservative Tehran Times also said that Iran's
Supreme National Security Council confirmed the involvement of
the elements supporting the Iranian outlawed Mujahedin Khalq
Organization (MKO) in the student protests.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, a main political and military group fighting against
former Iranian shah regime, was announced illegal in 1981
following sharp differences with the then Iranian government.
</P>
<P>
The MKO, labeled as "terrorist group" by Tehran, launched
various attacks on Iranian interest inside and outside Iran
during the past decade.

<HEADLINE> Cell Phone Costs to Fall in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Mobile phone costs will eventually
go down by 45 percent as a result of new initiatives by the Telkom
Kenya Limited, which monopolizes the telecommunications market of
this east African country.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the company Augustine Cheserem said
Wednesday that Telkom Kenya has set aside 160 million shillings
(about 2.2 million U. S. dollars) to rehabilitate its
telecommunications network.
</P>
<P>
However, Cheserem did not give a time table for the expected
drop, the East African Standard newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mobile phone services in Uganda and Tanzania are much cheaper
than that in Kenya. A treaty on the East African Community
consisting of the three countries is set to be signed in late
July, which will boost the creation of a regional common market.
</P>
<P>
Telkom Kenya was carved out of the former state-owned Kenya
Posts and Telecommunications Corporation in a privatization move
according to an act of parliament, which gave Telkom a one-year
guaranteed monopoly of Kenyan market before any strong competitors
are allowed in.
</P>
<P>
"Our telecommunications network has suffered a great deal due
to lack of funds and we hope that liberalization of the sector
will enable us to attract capital from the private sector, " said
Cheserem.
</P>
<P>
He said the company has also embarked on realizing the target
of improving service penetration in the rural areas from the
present 0.16 lines per 100 people to one line per 100 people, and
in the urban areas from four lines per 100 people to 20 lines per
100 people by the year 2015.
</P>
<P>
At an estimated average cost of about 2,000 dollars per line,
the total investment in the period will amount to 5.4 billion
dollars, according to the managing director.

of the overseas loans.

conducting a range of negotiations on Macao's smooth transition
and the transfer of power from Portugal to China.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhaokang, chief representative of the Chinese team of the

The two sides agreed at the meeting that they should handle
matters related to the transition and the transfer of power of
Macao in a positive and business-like manner.

<P>
BUENOS ARIES, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Brazil
overcame Mexico 2-0 to reach their third successive Copa America
soccer final on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Striker Amoroso and midfielder Rivaldo's scores in the first
half helped the World Cup runners-up win over uninspired opponents
comfortably in their semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Though Mexico won a dozen corners and several free kicks in
dangerous positions, none of them seriously threatened Brazil
goalkeeper Dida.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, who will meet Uruguay in the final, took the lead in
the 25th minute. Emerson Ferreira split the Mexican defense and
released Ze Roberto on the left, his cross hit a defender and sped
into the path of Rivaldo. Rivaldo's header rebounded against the
post and Amoroso fired home the rebound.
</P>
<P>
Three minutes before the break, after playing a one-two with
Ronaldo, Rivaldo scored the second goal with a left foot shot from
outside the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Ronaldo, booked in the quarter-final win over Argentina, was
substituted late in the game by Ronaldo Assis.
</P>
<P>
As in their first round matches with Brazil and Chile and their
quarter-final against Peru, Mexico improved significantly after
the halftime but this time they never looked dangerous.

<HEADLINE> Revenue Collection Falls Short of Target in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government collected
148.37 billion taka (about 3.059 billion U.S. dollars) of revenue
in the just-ended 1998-99 fiscal year, 5.5 percent short of the
original target of 157 billion taka (about 3.237 billion dollars),
The Independent Daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented a rise of 7.5 percent over the
collection of 138.02 billion taka (about 2.846 billion dollars) in
the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Due to shortfall in revenue collection from the very beginning
of the 1998-99 fiscal ending on June 30 this year, the government
revised down the revenue target at 148.50 billion taka (about
3.062 billion dollars) when Finance Minister Shah A.S.M. Kibria
presented the new national budget in parliament in June.
</P>
<P>
The revenue collection at the end of the financial year,
however, fell short by 0.08 percent against the revised revenue
collection target.
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry sources said the revenue collection shortfall
was resulted from the exemption of customs duty from a major
proportion of the import. The import of food which constituted a
large portion of the country's import was totally exempted from
the duty payment.
</P>
<P>
The revenue collection from the gas sector fell and from the
sale of tobacco declined causing shortfall in the revenue target,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The year experienced unprecedented flood and as a result the
tax collection from domestic business declined.
</P>
<P>
Other factors responsible for the revenue shortage included
decline in the country's industrial production, large scale
smuggling of Indian goods, and a declining trend in exports and
imports, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> hke071508 -Sri Lankan Rebels Reject Civilian Safety Zone Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Tamil rebels have
rejected a proposal by the army to establish a civilian safety
zone in the north of the country, Defense Ministry officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The army has proposed the setting up of a five-kilometer-long
and one-kilometer-wide civilian safety zone to serve the
humanitarian needs of civilians in uncleared areas in Wanni.
</P>
<P>
The zone is to encompass 500 meters wide of land on either side
of the main highway in the area, the Defense Ministry said in a
press release.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made with a view to minimizing confrontations
that will cause severe hardship to civilians, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) has
rejected the proposal and instead favored a much smaller zone of
250 meters long and 250 meters wide on either side of the main
highway.
</P>
<P>
The army said it is hardly adequate to ensure the safety of
civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry has called upon the LTTE to reconsider its
position bearing in mind the welfare and well-being of the public.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting a 16-year war against the Sri Lankan
government for a separate homeland for minority Tamils in the
north and east of the country.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: CHINA MASTERS NEUTRON BOMB TECH (more details with quotes) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- China has already mastered the
neutron bomb design technology, said Zhao Qizheng, director of the
Information Office of the State Council, at a press conference
held here this morning.
</P>
<P>
As early as in the 1970s and 1980s, China has already in
succession mastered the neutron bomb design technology and the
nuclear weapon miniaturization technology, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said this while refuting the Cox Report by the Select
Committee of the US House of Representatives, alleging that China
"stole" the design information on the US W-70 warhead (enhanced
radiation nuclear warhead, also known as the neutron bomb) from
the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
"The neutron bomb seems quite mysterious to ordinary people. In
fact, it is a kind of hydrogen (H) bomb," Zhao said, adding that "
Since China has already possessed atom bomb and H-bomb
technologies, it is quite logical and natural for it to master the
neutron bomb technology through its own efforts over a reasonable
short period of time."
</P>
<P>
China has successfully conducted its first atom bomb test on
October 16, 1964. On December 28, 1966 it mastered the principle
of H-bomb technology. And on June 17, 1967 it successfully carried
out its first H-bomb test.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that in 1964, Chinese scientist Wang Ganchang
initially advanced the concept of laser-based nuclear fusion. Wang,
who was also an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (
CAS), was considered as one of the scientists in the world who
have first independently put forward the concept.
</P>
<P>
China began systematic research on the technology of laser-
based nuclear fusion. In 1973, one-beam laser was used to drive
deuteron ice and a neutron was observed in the experiment. In 1974
a nuclear reaction took place through the use of one-beam laser on
a drive target of deuteron polymer, and a D-D reaction to produce
a neutron was observed.
</P>
<P>
In 1986 China adopted the direct driving method to produce a
neutron from a glass target capsule filled with D-T gas. Between
1990-92, through experimentation, thermonuclear fusion reaction
was achieved through the method of indirect driving, and
thermonuclear neutron was observed.
</P>
<P>
"It was revealed later from U.S. declassified documents that
Chinese and American scientists almost simultaneously advanced a
similar concept in their respective research," Zhao said,
stressing that "This fully indicates that the law governing
science exists objectively, and people from all over the world can
get hold of it sooner or later no matter what method is used."
</P>
<P>
He said Cox and others would not have made such a "silly"
mistake if they had seriously consulted experts. "It only reveals
their lack of general scientific knowledge," he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Thai Auto Sales Increase Sharply in 1st Half of This Year </HEADLINE>

<P>
BANGKOK, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's automobile market has
shown an marked improvement as sales in the first half of this
year increased 21 percent to 85,000 units, The Nation reported
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
For June only, the sales totaled more than 19,000 units, or an
82 percent growth over that of the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Ninnart Chaitheeraphinyo, president of the
Automotive Industry Association as saying that the government's
economic stimulus measures, especially interest rate cuts, have
helped changed consumer trends from saving money to buying cars.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of consumers buying cars with cash has dropped to 50
percent from 70 percent while those buying on credit has increased
to 50 percent from 30 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Before the economic crisis, 70 percent of cars were purchased
by credit with the remaining financed by cash.
</P>
<P>
"The car industry is quite sensitive to economic trends. When
the crisis broke out it was among the first to be hit. So now that
the market is improving, it should be a sign that the Thai economy
is returning to growth," Ninnart said.
</P>
<P>
The average monthly sale of 15,000 units is well above the
12,000- unit level in 1998, but still far from the peak sales
recorded in 1996 which totaled 590,000 units, or an average of
49,000 units per month.

<HEADLINE> Chilavert Says Copa Stadia Are White Elephants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Paraguayan goalkeeper Jose
Luis Chilavert said on Wednesday that the three stadia rebuilt for
the Copa America, being held in Paraguay, would become white
elephants after the competition finished.
</P>
<P>
"They (the organizers) said the stadia would be there
afterwards for the benefit of Paraguayan football but they will be
white elephants," the goalkeeper told an Argentine television
sports program.
</P>
<P>
"In the football of my country, the odd match between Cerro
Porteno and Olympia brings in some money, but the other matches
are played without anybody watching."
</P>
<P>
"I've always said that the Copa America should not be held in
Paraguay because in my country, there are a lot of poor people who
don't have enough to eat and we can't afford the luxury of
organizing a tournament of this size."
</P>
<P>
Chilavert, the Paraguay World Cup captain and goalkeeper who
also scores goals frequently from free kicks and penalties,
refused to play in the Copa America in protest at the money spent
in hosting the 12-team tournament.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay were knocked out by Uruguay on penalties in the
quarter-finals, when they appeared to sorely miss his charismatic
and inspiring leadership.
</P>
<P>
According to Chilavert, Uruguay was very inferior to Paraguay
and Paraguay got swept out because the team didn't do things well.

MANILA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Mayon volcano
caused five high-frequency volcanic earthquakes during the past 24
hours, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology
(Phivolcs) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, no significant ground movement of deformation was
observed on Wednesday, the Phivolcs said in a report issued here.
</P>
<P>
The Phivolcs also said steam emission was notably weak for the
latest observation period with a small sulfur dioxide value of 590
tons per day which was considerably less than the previous
measurements that ranged from 1,000 to 4,000 tons per day.
</P>
<P>
The aerial survey conducted Wednesday morning made it possible
to observe the crater directly, the Phivolcs said.
</P>
<P>
"The central explosion pit remained bowl-shaped and is littered
with volcanic deposits derived from the June 22 ash explosion and
from loose deposits of the crater," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Despite the volcano's apparent calm, the Phivolcs maintained
that it is too early to state that volcanic activity is on the
wane because no trend can yet be established.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, the very small steam and sulfur dioxide output
should be considered abnormal for Mayon, which usually emits
voluminous gases from its crater, the Phivolcs noted.
</P>
<P>
The Phivolcs therefore maintains Alert Level 2 over the
volcano, which is about 330 kilometers southeast of Manila.
</P>
<P>
Alert Level 2 means the public should not venture inside the
delineated six-kilometer radius permanent danger zone and the
seven-kilometer safety buffer zone in the southeast sector.
</P>
<P>
Mayon's last major eruption on February 2, 1993 killed 78
people and affected 17,119 people.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Speaks about Sino-Mongolian Ties (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang pointed to President Bagbandy's successful state visit to
China last year, saying that during the visit, the two sides,
proceeding from strategic heights at the turn of the century,
defined long-term, stable, healthy and good neighborly friendship
and cooperation of mutual trust oriented toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
This sets a clear direction for the future development of
bilateral ties, marking a new phase of Sino-Mongolian friendship,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with the continuous growth of bilateral ties,
" Jiang said, expressing the hope that his visit will help enrich
and expand Sino-Mongolian friendly cooperation in all areas, and
further friendship in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia is an important neighbor of China in the north, Jiang
went on, and China takes a consistent and firm position in putting
emphasis on developing friendship and cooperation with Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mongolia also places great importance on its
relations with China, and has repeatedly said that top priority is
given to ties with its two neighbors, China and Russia, in the
external relations. China highly values that and believes that
adhering to this wise policy accords with Mongolia's fundamental
and long-term interests.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also talked about Sino-Mongolian economic and trade
cooperation, saying that there are good conditions and guarantees
for further development.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the two countries, as near neighbors, have
geographical advantages. Both developing countries that enjoy
sound political relations and are carrying out economic reforms,
China and Mongolia are faced with the same tasks of developing the
economy and improving people's standards of living. These provide
good conditions and guarantees for economic and trade cooperation
between the two countries, he said.

Despite some twists and turns in bilateral ties since the
establishment of diplomatic ties, the Chinese president said,
goodneighborliness and friendship remain to be the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Sino-Mongolian cooperation in various fields
including politics, economy, trade, culture and education has
registered rapid progress and produced great achievements since
the normalization of relations in 1989.
</P>
<P>
He said that the two countries signed a new China-Mongolia
Treaty on Friendly Cooperative Relations five years ago in view of
the new development, in which the two sides reiterate their stance
to further promote goodneighborly and friendly relations of
cooperation on the basis of mutual respect for independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-mutual interference in
each other's internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit and
peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
This laid an important legal basis for the healthy and stable
development of bilateral relations, Jiang said.

The Cox Report, running to nearly 900 pages, lists many data,

<P>
For a period of time, some politicians in the United States
have clung on to the out-dated Cold War mentality, and made an
issue out of Sino-US relations by stirring up an anti-China mood
to reap political profit. Years of practice have proved that the
healthy development of Sino-US relations coincide with the
fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries.

MADRID, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Real Madrid will receive a special
dispensation to miss the first round of the Spanish Cup to enable
them to compete in FIFA's inaugural eight-team World Club
Championship in January in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid are invited as reigning world club champions - they

last season in the Intercontinental Cup Final in Tokyo - the match
which has traditionally determined the title of world club
champions.
</P>
<P>
They will be joined by the champions of the six FIFA

"China and Mongolia should give full play to these advantages,
and conduct economic and trade cooperation based on equality and
mutual benefit, from a long-term perspective, in a realistic

</P>
<P>
Jiang also expressed the hope that Mongolia will further

With the ever-increasing global economic and scientific and
technological exchanges and international cooperation, China has
made much headway in its economic and scientific and technological
exchanges, and cooperation with various countries.
</P>
<P>
Against this major background, Chinese and American nuclear
scientists have developed normal academic exchanges in many fields.
At the invitation of the US side, Chinese research institutes and
American national laboratories began exchanges and cooperation in
the 1990s, with the scope of cooperation ranging from nuclear
proliferation prevention to arms control and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
In July 1998, the two sides jointly held the Integrated
Demonstration of Material Protection, Control and Accountability
in Beijing. The publicity materials distributed by the US side at
the demonstration meeting pointed out that, between the 1980s and
the early 1990s, the laboratories of the US Department of Energy (
DOE), after contacts with related Chinese research institutes,
believed the two countries had many mutual interests and that
advances in technical exchanges in these fields could contribute
to greater understanding and trust between the two countries. (

While cooking up the lie that China "stole" America's most
advanced nuclear weapon design secrets and developed its own
nuclear weapons of a new generation on this basis, Cox and others
said alarmingly, "A modernized PRC strategic nuclear ballistic
missile force would pose a credible direct threat against the
United States."
</P>
<P>
As everybody knows, the Chinese Government has consistently
proposed the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
China, as a developing country, needs a peaceful international
environment, so that it can concentrate efforts on economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few decades, the Chinese Government and people
have always stood in the forefront of the struggle for complete
prohibition of nuclear weapons. However, facing the direct threat
of hegemonism to China's national security and state sovereignty,
and under the circumstance that nuclear blackmail and nuclear
monopoly still exist in the world, the Chinese people have no
other choice except to conduct self-defense.
</P>
<P>
It was under the circumstances of the nuclear threat and
nuclear blackmail posed by the superpowers that China was forced
to carry out the research and development of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
China is a peace-loving country. The very day when China
successfully exploded its first atom bomb on October 16, 1964, the
Chinese Government solemnly declared to the world that China would
never be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and under
any circumstances. Over the past few decades, this stand of China
has remained unchanged. The nuclear weapons that China was forced
to develop are quite limited in power and are solely for the
purpose of self-defense. Never did they in the past, nor do they
at present, or will they in the future, pose any threat to peace-
loving countries and peoples.

During the early period of rocket development, China had
established a rocket mechanical model and, in addition, had
determined various external forces (such as engine thrust and
aerodynamics) during the process of flight.
</P>
<P>
Strength and Environment, a professional Chinese publication in
1980, carried special introductions to this model shrinking method,
which, after 1984, was included in the Structure Vibration and
Dynamic Substructure Analysis Method, a textbook compiled by
Shanghai's Fudan University.
</P>
<P>
This is also an effective method, universally employed
worldwide, to describe the satellite structure. The former Soviet
Union and the United States also openly published articles about
this method. Once the satellite structure, shrunk through this
method, is connected with the rocket model, coupled loads
computation can then be conducted.
</P>
<P>
The method to calculate the coupled loads of satellite and the
launch vehicle that is commonly used in international commercial
launching services can help satellite manufacturers keep the
satellite's technical secrets because the mechanical model can by
no means restore the real structure of the satellite.
</P>
<P>
As to the investigation into the failed launch of the Intelsat-
708 on February 15, 1996, the Cox Report claims that it was under
the direction of US experts of the Independent Review Committee (
IRC) that the Chinese found the key cause for the failure.
</P>
<P>
The US satellite company demonstrated to the Chinese side how
to improve the design and reliability of the guidance system of
the LM rockets, which could also be used in developing ballistic
missiles, the Cox Report says.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the cause of the failure was found by Chinese
scientists independently.
</P>
<P>
This lay in the quality of the welding of the electronic device
in the follow-up frame loop of the rocket inertia platform. Such a
low-level problem has nothing to do with the design and
improvement of the rocket.

II. Fabrication That Lacks Basic Knowledge of Science and
Technology
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report deliberately distorts the development history of
China's space undertakings, alleging that China "acquired" the
technological know-how from the United States, which helped its
missile and space programs.
</P>
<P>
In fact, China's space sector has independently accomplished
development from scratch to the world's most advanced level by
totally relying on its own scientific forces.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances of all-round blockade and embargo
imposed by the United States and other Western countries, China
successfully developed intermediate and short-range missiles in
1964, and succeeded in launching its first man-made earth
satellite in 1970, and a recoverable satellite in 1975. There were
further developments between the late 1970s and the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
For example, China successfully launched a long-range rocket
into the Pacific Ocean in 1980, and a solid-propellant rocket from
a submarine in 1982, and further inserted a communications
satellite into a geostationary orbit in 1984. These achievements
had all been made before China entered the international
commercial satellite launching market, and, again, were
accomplished without any foreign assistance.

In 1935, Dr Qian Xuesen went to study in the United States as a
Tsinghua University student at public expense. He then stayed on
and worked there. After the People's Republic of China was founded
in 1949, the young, promising Dr Qian, who possesses high national
pride, confidence and integrity, yearned to return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
At that time, however, McCarthyism prevailed in the United
States. The US Government persecuted him under the pretext of
various "unwarranted" charges. Through representations made by the
Chinese Government on many occasions, Dr Qian finally returned to
the motherland in 1955.
</P>
<P>
Restricted by the US Government, he did not bring back with him
any research materials, and he even left behind some of his
personal articles of daily use.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report alleges that, since Qian Xuesen had been working
on the US Titan intercontinental missile program, he illegally
brought back with him to China the US missile technology and
related information.
</P>
<P>
This is purely fictitious slander. According to the Early
Development in Nuclear Force Guidance compiled by the FAS, the US
Titan missile program was determined in October 1953 based on the
suggestion of the US Air Force Strategic Missile Evaluation
Committee (later called the VON NEUMAN Committee), but related
government departments formally signed contracts for development
only in 1955.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, in July 1950, the security clearances qualifying
Qian Xuesen to participate in secret research were canceled by the
US Government, and he was detained.
</P>
<P>
Although he was later released on parole, he was subject to
restriction by the US Immigration Service and supervision by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation until he left the United States in
1955. Cox and others seemed to be quite meticulous in writing this
lengthy report. But, they even failed to make clear the sequence
of events. This, perhaps, is not merely negligence.

The IRC announced its founding on April 15 and terminated its
mission on May 13. During the 20-odd days, it held only two
meetings--one on April 22-23 in the United States and the other on
April 30-May 1 in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The actual work only lasted for four days. Since it was the LM-
3, and not the LM-3B responsible for the February 15 failure, that
would carry Apstar-1A, the Chinese side mainly explained to the
insurance companies and the IRC the differences between the rocket
platforms of LM-3B and LM-3, trying to make it clear that the
failure of the LM-3B would not affect the reliability of the
launching of Apstar-1A by the LM-3.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to re-establish the confidence of insurance
companies in the rocket, the Chinese side also released to them
and the IRC the periodical investigation results of the February
15 failure that had been proved by test.
</P>
<P>
Facing sharp market competition, China cannot easily give out
its rocket manufacturing secrets. During the existence of the IRC,
the Chinese side never expected it to help in the comprehensive
investigation and analysis of the failure.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Chinese side did not present the entire failure
investigation report to the IRC. Under such circumstances, how
could the IRC reveal to the Chinese side the guidance system
design for the "improvement" of the LM rocket, and what is the
basis for such an "improvement"?
</P>
<P>
In fact, the IRC only pointed out in its appraisal report that
"no indication was found which conflicts with the Chinese
conclusion", and it did not introduce any technology to the
Chinese side at all. Even during the existing period of the IRC,
the Chinese side had followed its own plan from the very beginning,
and actively continued the failure analysis work.
</P>
<P>
It could well be said that the Chinese side had completely
relied on its own effort to find out the final cause and take
improvement measures which ensured the following successes of the
LM-3B.

What deserves special mention is that a distinct difference
exists between the design technology of the fairing on a carrier
rocket and that of a multiple-warhead missile. The fairing of a
multi-warhead missile requires an all-weather, omni-bearing
operating environment; hence, an integrated design is generally
adopted. For carrier rockets, however, the technique of lateral
separation design is normally used. Therefore, it is out of the
question to make use of the rocket's fairing design technique for
improving that of a multiple-warhead missile.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report says China "acquired" the smart dispenser
technique through iridium satellite launches and has used it in
its MIRV (multiple independently targeted re-entry vehicle)
dispensing technology.
</P>
<P>
In fact, before launching an iridium satellite, China had
succeeded many times in launching multiple satellites atop a
single rocket.
</P>
<P>
In July 1990, China succeeded in its first launch of a dual
payload atop a LM-2C rocket, including a Pakistani satellite. The
two satellites were placed respectively in LEO (low earth orbit)
and geostationary transfer orbit. In September 1990, China used a
LM-4 to successfully place three satellites into solar stationary
orbit. In October 1992, the LM-2C rocket carried a Sweden FREJA
satellite and a Chinese recoverable satellite into the space,
inserting them into two different LEO. In February 1994, a LM-3A
was launched with Experiment-4 satellite and a dummy payload. This
fact indicates that China has already mastered, and has been
continuously improving, its dispenser design technique. There is
no key technology hard to master, let alone any need to make use
of iridium satellite launches for improving China's MIRV technique.

The US Titan-4 rocket, however, suffered three successive
failures on August 2, 1998, and on April 9 and 30, 1999. This
speaks for itself. Shortly after the Apstar-2 launch failure by a
LM-2E on January 26, 1995, the Chinese side immediately set up a
failure investigation leading group and a failure investigation
committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee had under it six failure analysis groups for
rocket debris analysis, fairing analysis, dynamics coupling
analysis, video-tape analysis and telemetry date analysis. They
made in-depth and careful studies and analysis on several
important parts, including the structure of the fairing, and
questioned the method for satellite-launch vehicle coupling.
</P>
<P>
The US side also made an analysis of the causes leading to the
launch vehicle and satellite failure. In their joint announcement
issued in Beijing on July 23, 1995, the China Great Wall Industry
Corp. and the US Hughes Space and Communications International Inc.
concluded that there were two possible causes:
</P>
<P>
(1) Under the shear wind aloft conditions in the winter season,
the resonance exerted due to the unique interface of the satellite
and the upper stage with the launch vehicle caused local
structural damage to the satellite.
</P>
<P>
(2) Under the shear wind aloft conditions in the winter season,
the fairing of the launch vehicle suffered local structural damage.

The Cox Report says, "China Great Wall Industry Corp.
determined that the root cause of the failure was a deterioration
in the gold-aluminum wiring connections within a power amplifier
for the follow-up frame torque motor in the inertial measurement
unit.
</P>
<P>
"This was the very problem the Independent Review Committee had
identified in their meetings with PRC officials and in the
Preliminary Report."
</P>
<P>
That conforms neither to the facts, nor to the basic law of
scientific investigation. The Chinese side's investigation lasted
for five months, with a great deal of testing demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the confirmation of the cause for such a specific
failure could hardly be made with only limited data material from
the preliminary investigation stage, and without a huge amount of
testings. During the IRC's four actual work days, the February 15
failure investigation was still in the stage of analyzing and
verifying the failure mode, and a great deal of testing work of
the sub-systems, parts and components remained to be done. How
could people localize the details of the final fault spot up to
the component in advance?
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report holds that the investigation of the February 15
failure helped the Chinese side improve its design scheme of
guidance system. In fact, although the LM-3B had a failure in its
inertia platform, the main cause was the quality of component,
which had nothing to do with the platform design scheme, to say
nothing of an "improvement" of the guidance system.
</P>
<P>
Thus, how could the conclusion "to improve the design of the
guidance system used in the PRC's newest Long March rocket" be
drawn in the Cox Report? Further more, how could the inference
that such an improvement was "capable of being adapted for use as
the guidance system for future PRC road-mobile intercontinental
ballistic missiles" be made? How could anyone believe the Cox
Report which has listed so many sensational conclusions according
to this kind of logic?

III. Clumsy Distortion of the Facts
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report spends two chapters on detailing the
investigation process and making a fuss about the Apstar-2
satellite launch failure by a LM-2E on January 26, 1995, and the
Intelsat-708 satellite launch failure by a LM-3B on February 15,
1996.
</P>
<P>
The report concludes that China "stole" or "illegally acquired"
US space technology through the failure investigation.
</P>
<P>
It says, "US satellite manufacturers transferred missile design
information and know-how to the PRC without obtaining the legally
required licenses. This information has improved the reliability
of PRC rockets useful for civilian and military purposes. The
illegally transmitted information is useful for the design and
improved reliability of future PRC ballistic missiles, as well."
Facts prove this conclusion is ill-founded.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report claims that during the failure investigation, US
satellite manufacturers provided China with a "diagnostic program"
for failure analysis and "transferred missile design information
and know-how".
</P>
<P>
The fact is that, with more than 40 years of independent
development of rockets and missiles, China has possessed a
complete set of reliability design methods and failure diagnosis
treatment regulations, as well as a strict quality guarantee
system.
</P>
<P>
The more than 100 flights undertaken are sufficient to ensure
China develops and manufactures highly reliable high-quality
missiles and carrier rockets, and acquires full ability to tackle
difficult problems in the launching process and remove failures.
Compared with the US expendable carrier rockets of the same
category, the reliability of China's carrier rockets is by no
means inferior (see table 1).

IV. A Story With a Beginning, But No End
</P>
<P>
There is no more ridiculous part in the Cox Report than Chapter
Seven, Launch Site Security in the PRC. Cox and his ilk believe
that the best chance for China to "steal" American satellite
technology through commercial launches would be when the American
satellite and related data were delivered to the Chinese launch
site. Therefore, they took great pains to collect and enumerate a
large amount of trifle materials and details, trying to prove that
China "stole" the American technology.

However, having failed to produce any evidence, they were
forced to repeatedly admit that the Select Committee has "found no
witness to confirm that a transfer to the PRC of controlled US
technology has occurred as a result of ineffective launch site
security".
</P>
<P>
But they were not willing to give up their preliminary
conclusion that China must have "stolen" American satellite
technology. Therefore, they have to use a lot of conjectural words,
such as "if" and "perhaps", to mislead public opinion.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, China has carried out over 20 commercial satellite
launches at the Xichang, Taiyuan and Jiuquan launch sites. Of
these, except for the Swedish and Pakistani satellite piggyback
launchings at Jiuquan and Xichang, and Sinosat-1 at Xichang, the
remaining satellites were all made in the United States.

To secure the safety of US-made satellites, China, as early as
December 1988, signed with the Government of the United States the
Memorandum of Agreement on Satellite Technology Safeguards. The
memorandum laid down strict, almost harsh, requirements for the
technology safeguards of US-made satellites to be launched in
China. For example:
</P>
<P>
--The Government of the United States of America shall oversee
and monitor implementation of the Technology Control Plan. Access
to all equipment and technical data will be controlled on a 24-
hour basis by US persons who have received training in security
procedures from the Government of the United States of America.
Such persons shall control access throughout launch preparations,
satellite launch and return of equipment to the United States of
America.
</P>
<P>
--The aircraft carrying the spacecraft, equipment, and
technical data, as well as its cargo, can pass through Customs in
the People's Republic of China without inspection, and will not be
subject to inspection while in the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
--Unless specifically permitted by persons authorized by the
Government of the United States of America, non-US persons will
not be allowed into the satellite preparation area for any purpose.
If non-US persons are allowed into the satellite preparation area,
they must be escorted at all times by US persons.
</P>
<P>
--For access to equipment by non-US persons, a temporary
identification badge will be issued, distinctive in color, which
will be marked "visitor". Issuance of these badges will be
controlled by US persons.

<P>
Here are some examples to show the US side's strict control
over US-made satellites:
</P>
<P>
--After the American aircraft carrying the satellite(s) arrived
at the launch site, it would be overseen by American security
personnel. The unloading of the satellite and other equipment from
the aircraft and onto road vehicles was handled by the US side. On
the way from airport to the launch site, these vehicles were all
escorted by American personnel. Even the destruction of the
satellite propellant remains after each launch was overseen by the
American security staff.
</P>
<P>
--Before the American satellites entered the satellite test
building at the launch site, American security personnel had
already checked the building many times. Even the curtains were
changed into the thick, heavy and wind-resistant type required by
the American side. During the whole launch process, all buildings
housing American satellites and equipment were guarded by American
security staff, and personnel from the Chinese side were forbidden
from approaching secured area. Access to such areas by Chinese
personnel should strictly follow the requirements cited in the
inter-governmental Memorandum of Agreement on Satellite Technology
Safeguards, such as advance approval, registration upon entrance
and exit, wearing badges issued by the US side and escorted by
American security personnel.
</P>
<P>
--At the satellite test and filling buildings, control rooms
and the operation platform on the launch tower, 18 American-
controlled video cameras were installed, conducting 24-hour
monitoring of the satellites and test equipment. In the satellite
working area of the test building alone, there were four video
cameras pointing at the satellites from different angles.
</P>
<P>
--At each meeting, questions raised or answered by personnel
from the US side had first to be approved by American security
officials. For example, to calibrate the electronic weighing
equipment of the Xichang Satellite Launch Site, the calibration
weights should have been prepared by the launch site. When the
Chinese side asked what exact calibration weights were needed, the
American security officials motioned to American technicians not
to answer.

<P>
Likewise, since the US side's reinforced monitoring of the US-
made satellites would affect the technology safety of China's re-
entry vehicle, the Chinese side had to implement round-the-clock
monitoring of its rockets as well.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report enumerates over 100 "security mistakes during
the launch in China", groundlessly assuming that China "probably"
used these mistakes to "steal" American satellite secrets.
</P>
<P>
For example, the fact that "the shower outside the satellite
filling building doesn't work" was also listed as a "security
mistake". In fact, the shower is for personnel who might get
contaminated if there was a satellite fuel leakage during the
filling procedure. It has nothing to do with satellite "technical
secrets".
</P>
<P>
Even more ridiculous is the claim that "the PRC could
accomplish even exploitation that penetrated the interior of the
satellite, given two hours of time, without leaving any traces,''
and "there is almost nothing about a US satellite that the PRC
could not learn from unrestricted access for 24 hours."
</P>
<P>
It is known to all that a satellite is an extremely large,
complicated and precise high-tech product. It is composed of tens
of thousands of components, thousands of parts and dozens of
branch systems, covering knowledge of many subjects. How can it be
mastered within a few hours? Just as the old saying goes: If you
are out to condemn somebody, you can always trump up a charge.
</P>
<P>
Mr A.D. Coates, an American Government-appointed security
official on many occasions for US-made satellite launches, told
the Chinese side after the Aussat-B1 launch failure on March 22,
1992, that "as a security official of the Government of the United
States, I can say in a responsible way that the Chinese side has
completely observed the Technology Safeguards Agreement between
the two governments on the American-made satellites launched from
Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
"In the technical coordination meetings in the three years
since the Aussat contract was signed, and the joint operation in
this campaign, no unauthorized technology transfer has occurred. I
am well satisfied with the cooperation between China and the
United States, and appreciate all your collaboration."
</P>
<P>
US Defense Technology Security Administration Director Tarbell
admitted that he was not aware of any evidence that this access
resulted in a technology transfer that would significantly affect
America's national security.

</P>
<P>
Jiang said that this year marks the 50th anniversary of Sino-
Mongolian diplomatic ties and the fifth anniversary of the China-
Mongolia Treaty on Friendly Cooperative Relations, adding that
during his visit, he will take the opportunity to review the past

What is most malicious about the Cox Report is that it links
China's policies and guidelines for developing science and
technology, the research institutes and their staff engaging in
bilateral scientific and technological exchanges, the business
agencies and their staff engaging in economic and trade exchanges,
the official and non-official Chinese representative offices and
their staff in the United States, American Chinese and Chinese
students in America with the so-called espionage activities.
</P>
<P>
This is typical racial discrimination, and a deadly insult to
the Chinese nation. It marks the reappearance of McCarthyism,
active in the United States during the 1950s, and reflects the
aberrant personality of some American politicians hostile to China
's development and becoming powerful.
</P>
<P>
The "863 Program" is an open and normal medium-to-long-term
scientific research and development plan launched by the Chinese
Government in 1986. It is a strategic policy-decision made by the
nation to use its own intellectual, financial and material
resources to independently develop science and technology in order
to narrow the gap with foreign advanced scientific and technical
level and accelerate its own national economic development.
</P>
<P>
But, in the Cox Report, this program is groundlessly associated
with the "theft" of American technology, sensitive military
technology in particular. Never did China in the past, nor does it
at present or will it in the future, develop its science and
technology on the basis of so-called "theft".

<P>
Compared with the high-tech development programs of other
countries, China's "863 Program" has the following characteristics:
First, as a high-tech plan of a developing country, it sets quite
limited areas and goals which center on economic development and
improvement of the people's living standards.
</P>
<P>
Second, under the circumstances of a comparatively weak high-
tech foundation, the plan aims at learning useful international
experience and advanced technology through normal channels
conforming to common international practices. The "863 Program"
mainly involves the science and technology related to the
development of the national economy and overall national strength.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the 13 key technological development projects and
the eight major achievements transfer projects outlined in the "
863 Program" during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-95)
were:
</P>
<P>
(1) Key technologies: two-line hybrid rice, insect pest-
resistant transgenic cotton and other transgenic plants, gene
therapy for malignant tumors and other diseases, large scale
parallel computing, optical fiber amplifier and pump, infra-red
adaptive optics observation system for 2.16-meter telescope, 2.48
GB/S SDH high speed optical fiber transmission system, airborne
real-time remote sensing imaging transmitting and processing
system, STEP-based CAD/CAPP/CAM system, 6,000-meter autonomous
underwater vehicle, high-temperature gas-cooled reactor, double-
layer glow plasma surface alloying technology, and research of the
diamond film;
</P>
<P>
(2) Major achievements transfer projects: genetic engineering
polypeptide drugs, two-line hybrid rice demonstration, new era
computers, high-powered laser and its applications, enterprises'
CIMS application demonstration, robotic automation demonstration
engineering, high-performance low-sintering temperature multi-
layer ceramics capacitor, nickel-metal hydride batteries and
related materials.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report intentionally distorts the research projects
included in the "863 Program". For instance, the gene research
plan which was clearly designed for the development of new
medicines is said "could have biological warfare application".
</P>
<P>
The plan for developing a high-temperature gas-cooled reactor
by Qinghua University is a basic research project for the
development of the civilian use of nuclear energy, but it is said
to "aid in the development of nuclear weapons". This cannot but
show people how skilled Cox and others are at fabricating lies.

<HEADLINE> Cox Report Further Refuted (31) VI. Absurd Logic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China is a developing country. Due to its limited financial
capacity, it has to buy some commercially worthwhile second-hand
equipment with less advanced technological level but at a low
price.
</P>
<P>
However, such normal commercial activities were regarded by Cox
and others as China's "theft" of technology from the United States.
Chapter 10 of the Cox Report describes at great length how the
China National Aero-Technology Import-Export Corp. (CATIC)
purchased second-hand equipment from the US McDonnell Douglas Corp.
in 1994, giving enormous publicity to these normal commercial
activities.
</P>
<P>
It also links these pure commercial activities with US national
security, which is totally unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
In fact, in February 1994, CATIC and McDonnell Douglas signed a
second-hand equipment purchase contract, to the effect of
importing over 200 sets of machining equipment and instruments.
China bought these second-hand equipment totally out of a
commercial consideration.
</P>
<P>
They had all been used for years, and could no longer be
considered advanced. Of the 200-odd pieces of equipment, 19 needed
a US Government export license.
</P>
<P>
In advance of the import, the Chinese Government provided the
Importer Statement on End-User and End-Use for 18 of the items at
the request of the US side, and the Chinese user filled out the
enterprise guarantee on the spot for the remaining one. Table 2
illustrates in detail the year the 19 pieces of equipment were
made and their technical status.

<HEADLINE> Cox Report Further Refuted (33) VII. Thought Running Counter to Historical Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the most striking achievements in modern scientific and
technological progress is the development and application of the
computer. It has played an important role in the development of
the global economy and the progress of human civilization.
</P>
<P>
Today, computers have been more and more closely related with
people's daily lives and widely used in all fields of economic and
social life. Now, computers can be found everywhere--in teaching
and scientific research, commercial activities, outdoor tours,
daily life, medical service and health care, banking and financial
management, as well as in weather forecasting, transportation and
communications.
</P>
<P>
Cox and others, however, intentionally over-emphasize the use
of computers in the military field. They look on the development
and application of computers as a tool threatening and even
destroying mankind rather than as a factor benefiting mankind, and
devote enormous coverage to the negative aspect.
</P>
<P>
Cox and others propose to strengthen the control over the
export of computers to other countries. This is an action running
totally counter to the historical trend.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report alleges that the main purpose of China's
development and application of advanced computers is to apply them
in the military field, and that China has used illegal means to "
acquire" US computer technology. This does not tally with the
facts in any way.

Like other countries in the world, China develops and uses
computers for the purpose of accelerating the development of the
national economy, improving the people's living standards and
making daily life more convenient.
</P>
<P>
China has imported many computers, including high performance
ones, along with spare parts from the United States. In 1995, for
example, the China Meteorological Center imported the CRAY/c-92, a
high performance computer, from the US-based Cray Co. for
analyzing and processing meteorological data. How does weather
forecast, a work beneficial to entire mankind, menace the US
security?
</P>
<P>
China imports computers from the United States through normal
commercial channels in accordance with business rules commonly
practiced in the world, which also has brought enormous commercial
benefits to the United States, and created many employment
opportunities for it.
</P>
<P>
China has always believed that, in the field of computer
exports, the control policy of the United States runs against the
historical tide, creating man-made barriers for the healthy
development of bilateral economic and trade relations and harming
the trade balance between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The so-called high performance computers mentioned in the Cox
Report refer to those with a speed of 2000 MTOPS (million
theoretical operations per second). But China had long been able
to make computers operating at a much higher speed. The operation
speed of computers China makes now far exceeds 2000 MTOPS.

Although the United States has imposed all sorts of
restrictions on computer exports, China has never ventured to "
acquire" American computer technologies through abnormal channels.
In order to apply for a US computer export license, the Chinese
Government, at the request of the US side, provided the Importer's
Statement on End-User and End-Use, making an end-user and end-use
commitment.
</P>
<P>
 In order to maintain the credit of the Chinese Government and
exercise effective management over the work related to the
Importer's Statement on End-User and End-Use, responsible
government departments have issued a series of specific and
effective rules and regulations, stipulating that commodities
imported after going through the formality of the Importer
Statement on End-User and End-Use can only be used for the purpose
designated in the statement and that, without the permission from
the original exporting nation, the commodities are not allowed to
be exported to a third country.
</P>
<P>
 Years of practice have proved that the Chinese Government has
exercised serious and effective management over the work.
</P>
<P>
 Examining the end-user of computers is not a common
international practice. However, in order to promote the
development of Sino-US economic and trade relations, the Chinese
side made utmost efforts in this respect, reaching an
understanding with the US side in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
 Within half a year after the understanding was reached, the
US side made requests for seven visits to China. China tried its
best to accommodate the requests and did, in fact, have arranged
six visits.
</P>
<P>
 It shows the sincerity of the Chinese side, and the US side
has never challenged this aspect. The Cox Report, however, turns a
blind eye to this and, further more, accuses China of breaking its
promises, which is not true.

VIII. Criticism of the Cox Report From the Media and Experts
Worldwide
</P>
<P>
After it was released, the Cox Report has been criticized by
the media as well as experts and scholars in some countries,
including the United States, for its elements of fantasy and
absurdity.
</P>
<P>
--The New York Times of the United States said on May 25 that
the facts stressed in the Cox Report were too fantastic and
complicated. The conclusion of the report was arbitrary. Without
hard answers and without a suspect under arrest, the case is like
a thriller missing its final pages, it said.
</P>
<P>
--Suddeutsche Zeitung, a German newspaper, said on May 25 that
the Cox Report asked more questions than it answered and had more
accusations than explanations.
</P>
<P>
--Mainichi Shimbun of Japan said on May 28 that the Cox Report
did not provide any conclusive proof of China's "theft" of
technologies. Instead, it mostly used such vague terms as "
probably" or "seemingly".
</P>
<P>
--Lyndon H. LaRouche, founder of the Executive Intelligence
Review, said in a statement published on June 2 that the Cox
Report was a fraud. Its accusation of the so-called Chinese "theft
of nuclear secrets" was sheer fabrication. The fraud of the Cox
Report is "a reflection of the kind of scientific illiteracy'' of
its writers. LaRouche said that the so-called "nuclear secrets"
were easily obtainable from the Internet, but the Cox Committee
spent a great sum of money in investigating these false charges,
which was simply "too ridiculous". LaRouche went on to point out
that the clear purpose of the Cox Committee was to undermine US-
China relations.

--The ABC News of the United States said in a story headlined
Errors Mar Cox Report that there are many amazing de facto
mistakes. Mistakes range from substantial misrepresentation of
Chinese aerospace technology to minor errors in dates and hardware
designations.
</P>
<P>
 This makes people wonder how credible the Cox Report is: Are
these erroneous facts the basis for the report's conclusion?
</P>
<P>
 --Joseph Cirincione, expert with the US Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, said the Cox Report "lacks basic support",
and "is purely a propaganda work".
</P>
<P>
 It was the "least convincing" investigation report he had
ever seen. He thought the report required the US Government to
tighten up supervision and administration over the export of
sensitive technologies and equipment, such as satellites and super
computers, to China. This could be very difficult to operate as it
would arouse complaints from commercial interest groups.
</P>
<P>
 --Frankfurter Fundschau, a German newspaper, said on May 25
that many US politicians "are now keenly looking for a new evil
empire". Delivering such a report aims at attacking the existing
China policy of the United States instead of finding the truth.
</P>
<P>
 --Hong Kong Standard said on May 30 that what the Americans
were shouting at and flailing against was merely their
hallucination of China's shadow. It said that there were not many
people in the West, and even less in the East, who treated the Cox
Report seriously.
</P>
<P>
 It stated that the Cox Report lashed the US Government's
China policy on the one hand, and directed its target of attack to
China on the other.
</P>
<P>
 --The Los Angeles Times reported on May 30 that Robert Norris,
a military expert, had criticized the Cox Report sharply. He
thought the impression created by the report was that each of
China's weaponry achievements was gained by espionage, instead of
from scientific and technical journals or academic conferences.
</P>
<P>
 In fact, large quantities of technical information can be
gained from openly published publications either in China or
anywhere else. Scientific secrets are not absolute, and are not
the property of any country, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Hold Swimming Simulation Ahead of SEA Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- To allow the national swimmers to
prepare to compete in the 20th Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in
Brunei Darussalam next month, the Indonesian Swimming Federation (
PRSI) will hold a two-day simulation for its 13 swimmers.
</P>
<P>
PRSI's technical commission chief Lukman Niode said that the
simulation would take place two weeks or 10 days before the whole
contingent departs for Brunei on August 3.
</P>
<P>
"We expect our swimmers to be able to adapt to the competitive
situation by competing in the heats in the morning and in the
finals in the evening. I think they won't have any problem with
the climate in Bandar Seri Begawan," Lukman was quoted by The
Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Eight swimmers -- Wisnu Wardhana, twin brother Felix and Albert
C.Sutanto, M. Akbar Nasution, Hendrik Eko AP, Elsa Manora Nasution,
Siripiya Sutanto and Ati Yuliani -- have just returned from a five-
week training program in Brisbane, Australia, and now training at
the Senayan swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
"The swimmers' conditions are between 85 and 90 percent toward
their peak performance in the SEA Games," said Lukman, a former
national swimmer.
</P>
<P>
PRSI is still waiting for four other swimmers, veteran Richard
Sam Bera, Steven Chandra, Nancy Surya Atmaja and Dyah Ayu Rahmani
to join the program.
</P>
<P>
Richard will compete in a three-day swimming competition in

<P>
The Cox Report subjectively surmises, "The PRC would, therefore,
be especially interested in acquiring US thermonuclear weapons
codes for any new weapons based on elements of stolen US design
information." It continues, "The PRC has in fact acquired some US
computer codes, including: the MCNPT code, the DOT3.5 code, and
the NJOYC code." In fact, the three codes are standard ones
extensively used worldwide for decades in nuclear reactor
engineering design, nuclear reactor radiation shielding safety
analysis and other fields of nuclear energy research. They are
widely applied by many research institutes, universities and
atomic energy engineering research and design institutes of IAEA (
International Atomic Energy Agency) member countries. They have
nothing to do with the design of thermonuclear warhead.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote the development of China's nuclear power
construction, in the early 1980s, China acquired gratis from the
IAEA the DOT3.5 code for calculating nuclear reactor safety. In
the middle and latter half of the 1980s, it acquired the MCNPT
code for tackling the same problem and the NJOYC code for nuclear
data research. Over many years, Chinese scientists have
consistently and punctually fed back the problems found in the
course of utilization and the results of calculation to the IAEA
and various programming units. Obviously, Chinese scientists have
made their own contributions to the improvement of the functions
of these computer codes. As a responsible member of the IAEA over
a long period,China has organized dozens of domestic universities
and scientific research institutes to participate in this
international cooperative research. The research results and
computer software developed by Chinese scientists have been
provided frequently to the IAEA to be shared by its member
countries. The Cox Report, denying China's positive contributions
to the global peaceful utilization of atomic energy, slanders
China for "illegally" acquiring computer software codes to develop
its own nuclear weapons. This only exposes an ignorance of general
scientific and technical knowledge.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investments in Agricultural Development Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIHAI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investors have shown
growing interest in investing in agricultural development projects
in Beihai, a port city in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the coastal city has drafted and
published a series of preferential policies to encourage investors,
especially overseas ones, to pump up investment into the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
By late June, the city had approved 43 overseas-financed
agricultural projects which require a total investment of 89.12
million U.S. dollars. Overseas investors actually provided 42.92
million U.S. dollars in cash and 3.548 million U.S. dollars worth
of commodities for the development projects.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city has also used World Bank loans to
finance four other agricultural development projects, of which,
the project for breeding of aquatic products requires 27.73
million U.S. dollars, and the project for growing vegetables need
a total investment of 10 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Beihai sits on a rhinohorn-shape peninsula at the south China
coast in Guangxi. The city has a coastline of 107 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
With a history of 2,000 years, Beihai is a place from which
merchant vessels used to sail west to the Indian Ocean, passing
the Malay Peninsula and up along Myanmar's coast. With Southeast
Asia across the sea and being close to Hong Kong and Macao, Beihai
is a sea exit for inland areas of southwest China.

<HEADLINE> Lower Water Level at Source of Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The water level of Ngoring and
Gyaring lakes on the upper reaches of Yellow River, the second
largest in China, dropped by nearly two meters, according to a
recent survey on the river.
</P>
<P>
Yellow River originates in the Kariqu and Yueguzongliequ lakes
which join flow before entering Gyaring and Ngoring lakes, the
fresh water lakes with the highest elevation in China. Then the
river runs down eastward.
</P>
<P>
Gyaring Lake covers an area of 526 square kilometers with an
average depth of nine meters while Ngoring Lake is 617 sq. km. in
area with a depth of 17 meters. They play a vital role in
adjusting the storage and water flow of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The minimum water flow of Ngoring has reduced from 168 cubic
meters in 1989 to none in 1998. Moreover, water flow between the
two lakes dried up this year for the first time in recorded
history, said Quan Xunzhang, head of the survey team.
</P>
<P>
Gengque, magistrate of Madoi County, said that water runs out
of Ngoring Lake at a rate of 2.71 cubic meters per second and its
intake is 0.006 cubic meters per second. Its water level declines
by one centimeter every four to five days. Other lakes at the
source of the Yellow River have also shrunk or salinized.

<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Zhao Qizheng, director of the
Information Office of the State Council, further refuted today the
"Cox Report" by the U.S. Congress with abundant facts.
</P>
<P>
"To clarify the truth and air the facts, the Information Office
of the State Council has conducted further investigations into the
issues raised in the report," Zhao said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He clarified matters and rebutted the subreption related to
manufacture of nuclear weapons, commercial satellite launches,
exchanges of science and technology, economic and trade
cooperation, machine tools, and high performance computers.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on the report made at an earlier press
conference held on May 31, Zhao had pointed out that the
concoction of the Cox Report was a farce aimed at fanning anti-
China mood and undermining Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
"Voluminous facts indicate that the conclusions drawn by the
report do not hold water, and even act contrary to the general
knowledge of science and technology in many aspects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao noted that it was totally groundless that the Cox Report
accused China of "stealing" secret information on the most
advanced thermonuclear warheads possessed by the United States.
</P>
<P>
"It is not only a grave calumny on the Chinese people and
Chinese scientists, but also a kind of obvious racial
discrimination," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, China has mastered in succession the
neutron bomb design technology and the nuclear weapon
miniaturization technology as early as in 1970s and 1980s," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Barak Arrives in Washington on Mideast Peace Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- New Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak arrived in Washington on Wednesday night to discuss with
President Bill Clinton issues of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
During his five-day visit here, Barak will meet Clinton on
Thursday and again next Monday. He will also hold intensive talks
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Clinton attaches great importance to Barak's visit and has said
he looks forward to the visit "eager as a kid with a new toy."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's Middle East strategy is conciliation between Israel
and Arab nations in the west and containment on Iraq and Iran in
the east. But because of former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's opposition to the policy of "land for peace", key to
the peace process, Clinton's strategy has suffered setbacks over
past three years. And now he pins hope on Barak who advocates
conciliation with the Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
But Barak would not like the United States "overly involved" in
the Middle East matters. Before his departure for Washington, he
told the New York Times that the Americans should be able to
return to their "special role as facilitators" and stop acting as
"arbitrator, policeman and judge."
</P>
<P>
That raised some questions in Washington about the extent to
which the United States and Israel are singing from the same sheet.
</P>
<P>
Barak also floated ideas about making changes to the Wye
agreement which Clinton painstakingly mediated last October
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Full implementation now is too risky," Barak told the New York
Times. "It would reduce our chances of achieving a permanent peace.
"
</P>
<P>
He said he favored either partial implementation or
amalgamating various Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But the United States insisted that the Wye agreement be
implemented quickly without any changes.
</P>
<P>
"We're not suggesting that the agreement should be changed, "
State Department spokesman James Rubin said. "On the Contrary, we
think that both sides should implement the agreement, period, full
stop ... It can and should be implemented now."
</P>
<P>
All these have cast some damper on euphoria for a quick revival
and fulfilling of the peace process in the Middle East.

"It is sheer nonsense that the report alleged China 'stole' the
secrets of the nuclear explosion tests of miniature fusion from

</P>
<P>
Wang Ganchang, a noted Chinese physicist and academician of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), initially advanced the concept
of laser-based nuclear fusion as early as in 1964, when China
successfully exploded its first atom bomb. Wang was one of the
first scientists in the world who have independently put forward
the concept.

Yu Min, a renowned Chinese theoretical physicist and CAS
academician, and a team of Chinese scientists advanced the concept
of achieving laser fusion through the method of the X-ray
radiation for driving by shooting laser into a heavy metal shelled
cavity through the entrance, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Yu and his partners also put forward the
structural design of placing target pellets at the center of the
columnar hollow cavity.
</P>
<P>
China manufactured its own laser device, known by "Shen Guang"
(magic light), for research into laser-based nuclear fusion at the
turn of 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report assaulted that China "stole" or "illegally
acquired" U.S. missile technology through commercial satellite
launches in order to improve its own missiles.
</P>
<P>
"People with even slight knowledge of science and technology
would know that a carrier rocket is developed on the basis of
ballistic missiles," Zhao said, "The carrier rocket and missile
have different requirements in terms of guidance precision."
</P>
<P>
The guidance of a rocket was mainly for controlling the orbital
injection precision of satellite, while a missile's guidance
system was to control the deviation during its three major phases
of flight, the powered and unpowered flight phases and the re-
entry phase, so as to ultimately achieve pinpoint accuracy in
delivering the warhead on the selected target.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that a missile requires greater precision in the
guidance system than a carrier rocket," Zhao said, "The greater
the precision of a commercial satellite launch, the higher the
cost."
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, commercial launches did not require
excessively high guidance technology considering economic
rationality. "How can one use the rocket guidance technology for
improving the guidance precision of missiles?" Zhao questioned. (

The Cox Report also said that China has acquired U.S. carrier
rocket fairing technique through commercial satellite launches,
which "may assist the design and improve reliability of future PRC
MIRVed missiles and of future submarine-launched ballistic
missiles".
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that prior to 1992, China had developed two kinds
of fairing, and succeeded in many launches under wind aloft
conditions in winter season," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
"What deserves special mention is that a distinct difference
exists between the design technology of the fairing on a carrier
rocket and that of a multiple-warhead missile," he added, "the
fairing of a multi-warhead missile requires an all-climate, omni-
bearing operating environment, which generally results in an
integrated design."
</P>
<P>
The technique of lateral separation design, however, was
normally used for carrier rockets. Therefore, it was out of the
question to make use of the rocket's fairing design technique for
improving that of a multiple-warhead missile, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that the Cox Report also largely misrepresented the
investigation about the Intelsat708 satellite launch failure by a
Long March-3B on February 15, 1996. The report claimed that it was
under the direction of U.S. experts of the independent Review
Committee (IRC) that the Chinese found the key cause for the
failure and "illegally obtained" U.S. technology out of process.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the cause of the failure was independently found by
Chinese scientists," he said, "The reason came from the quality of
the welding of the electronic device in the follow-up frame loop
of the rocket inertia platform. Such a low-level problem has
nothing to do with the design and improvement of the rocket." (

failure mode, and a great deal of testing work of the sub-systems,
parts and components remained to be done. "How could people
localize the details of the final fault spot up to the component
in advance?"
</P>
<P>
There was no more absurd part in the Cox Report than Chapter
VII about the launch site security in China. Cox and his ilk
collected and enumerated a lot of so-called materials and details
in an attempt to prove that China "stole" the U.S. technology.
Having no evidence, they had to apply terms of conjecture such as
"if", "perhaps" to mislead the public.
</P>
<P>
Zhao gave several examples to show the U.S. side's strict
control over U.S.-made satellites. At the satellite test and
filling buildings, control rooms and the operation platform on the
launch tower, 18 American-controlled video cameras were installed
for around-the-clock monitoring of the satellites and test
equipment. "No videotapes can prove that the Chinese had any
access to the U.S.-made satellites," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In the satellite working area of the test building alone, four
video cameras were pointed at the satellites from different angles.
</P>
<P>
Zhao mentioned in particular that likewise, since the U.S. side
's reinforced monitoring of the U.S.-made satellites would affect
the technology safety of China's re-entry vehicle, the Chinese
side had to implement 24-hour monitoring of its rockets as well. (

<HEADLINE> China Further Refutes Cox Report (6) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It is typical racial discrimination, and a deadly insult to
the Chinese nation that the Cox Report links the so-called
espionage activities with China's policies and guidelines for
developing science and technology, the research institutes and
their staff engaging in bilateral scientific and technological
exchanges, the business agencies and their staff engaging in
economic and trade exchanges, the official and non-official
Chinese representative offices and their staff in the United
States, American Chinese and Chinese students in the United States,
" Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
"It marks the reappearance of McCarthyism, active in the United
States in 1950s, and reflects the aberrant personality of some
American politicians hostile to China's development and becoming
powerful," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhao pointed out that the Cox Report listed many data, which
were either intentionally fabricated or painstakingly distorted.
Although it could whip up public opinion and hoodwink some people
for a while, it could not do so for long.
</P>
<P>
"For a period of time, some politicians in the United States
have clung on to the out-dated Cold War mentality, and made an
issue out of Sino-U.S. relations by stirring up an anti-China mood
to reap political profit," Zhao said, "Years of practice have
proved that the healthy development of Sino-U.S. relations
coincide with the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
"It is really dishonorable for some U.S. politicians trying
hard to undermine Sino-U.S. relations by fabricating lies," he
said, "But, it is impossible for them to succeed."

The Information Office of the State Council also released an

basket has been 12.02 dollars per barrel, which is 3.02 dollars
above the sale price estimated in the Nation's budget for 1999.

<P>
LANZHOU, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu province
has decided to allocate an additional one billion yuan to its
poverty-relief efforts, boosting its total financial support to
nearly 1.6 billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
With the huge funding, the provincial government will be able
to reach its goal of providing adequate food and clothing for 800,
000 people living in poverty through various development projects.
</P>
<P>
When the government officially launched its poverty-relief
campaign in 1983, this inland province's impoverished population
stood at 12.54 million.
</P>
<P>
After 16 years of hard work, the provincial government has been
successful in getting more than 10 million people out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Now the number of people living in poverty has dropped to 1.77
million or 8.8 percent of its population, compared to 74.8 percent
in 1983.

With this year's record-high financial support, the province
will try to help 20 of its poverty-stricken counties to provide

counties in Hexi and Dingxi areas, according to provincial
government sources.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Bank Recapitalization to Cost Half GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The cost for restructuring and
recapitalizing the country's battered banking sector was estimated
at 550 trillion rupiah (about 82 billion U.S. dollars), or about
50 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Minister of Finance Bambang Subianto said the burden to the
state budget in the next fiscal year beginning from April 2000
would be much higher than the 34 trillion rupiah (about 5.07
billion dollars) allocated in the current 1999/2000 budget.
</P>
<P>
"The burden to the budget in the next fiscal year will be
greater, but we're still calculating it," Bambang was quoted by
The Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said lessening the burden on the state budget depended on
how successful the monetary authority was in lowering domestic
interest rates and checking inflation.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's benchmark interest rate dropped to 15.86
percent on Wednesday from 35 percent earlier this year. The
interest rate on Bank Indonesia's three-month promissory note also
dropped, falling to 15.66 percent from 23.33 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has allowed interest rates to fall on the back
of a stronger rupiah and lower inflation.
</P>
<P>
The government is issuing bonds to finance the bank
restructuring and recapitalization program. The bonds will carry a
fixed interest rate and a floating rate linked to the interest
rate on the three-month promissory note.
</P>
<P>
The government has so far issued 157.61 trillion rupiah (23.52
billion dollars) worth of bonds, of which 103.8 trillion rupiah
(15.49 billion dollars) was allocated for the recapitalization of
seven private banks, four nationalized banks and 12 provincial
development banks. The remaining 53.81 trillion rupiah (8.03
billion dollars) will be used to repay money the government
borrowed from the central bank to bail out banks last year.
</P>
<P>
The government plans further bond issues, 233.25 trillion
rupiah (34.78 billion dollars) of which will be used to
recapitalize the country's seven state banks.
</P>
<P>
The state budget will carry the cost of the bonds' interest
rate, which in the current fiscal year is estimated at 34 trillion
rupiah (5.07 billion dollars). The Indonesian Bank Restructuring
Agency (IBRA) is responsible for half of this amount.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia hopes to complete bank restructuring by the end of
the year.

<HEADLINE> 23,000 Tons of Banana Destroyed in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Costa Rica-based North
American Company, Standard Fruit, confirmed on Wednesday that it
has destroyed more than 23,000 tons of bananas in the shadow of
excessive production.
</P>
<P>
The banana market has been plagued since last April by
overproduction, which has spurred a 50-percent drop in the market
prices.
</P>
<P>
The price of a box containing 18.14 kilograms of bananas has
fallen from 12.50 dollars to only 6.75 dollars on the U.S. market.
In the European Union, where the prices have traditionally been
much higher, the price has fallen from 20.7 dollars last year to
the current 12.6 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Producers find that they could hardly cover the production
costs and have decided to leave part of the produce on the farms.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman from Standard Fruit, Juan Carlos Rojas, said that
the company has chosen not to export 300,000 boxes of bananas from
independent producers, in addition to 1 million boxes produced by
the company.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Trade Minister Samuel Guzowsky visited Brussels last

<HEADLINE> Mia Ready for Singapore, Indonesia Badminton Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- After a two-month break in which
she gained a considerable amount of weight, Indonesian women's
singles player Mia Audina says she is ready to compete in the
Singapore and Indonesia opens next month, The Jakarta Post
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mia, who recently returned with her husband Tylio Lobman from a
vacation in the Netherlands, said she was ready to fight for the
Grand Prix series titles.
</P>
<P>
"I have to play in those two tournaments as a way to qualify
for the Olympics. I hope I can regain my number one position at
the end of the qualifying round on April 30, 2000. But I think I
can only manage to stay in the top five," she said.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 Olympic silver medalist has long been tipped to take
over the number one spot from Susi Susanti, now in semiretirement
after giving birth. However, Mia's marriage to Surinamese Lobman
on March 30 and her sometimes rancorous relationship with the
Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) have caused controversy.
</P>
<P>
Mia said she continued to train during her stay in the
Netherlands, but admitted she gained weight.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how much I weigh now because I don't dare to know.
But I will reduce it soon during practice," she said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged her bid to climb from a ranking of 18 back
into the top five would be difficult because of the crop of
talented young Chinese players, including world number one Dai Yun,
number three Gong Ruina and number four Zhang Ning. Another rivals
is world champion Camilla Martin of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old shuttler also will need to displace compatriots
Cindana Hartono, ranked seventh, and Lydia Djaelawidjaja, ranked
11th.
</P>
<P>
In Mia's absence, Cindana and Lydia showed they could replace
her in the Sudirman Cup and World Championships although they lost
in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
The PBSI official in charge of athletes development Mangombar
Ferdinand Siregar said he would consult with Mia's coach Liang
Chiusia on her physical fitness before sending her to the
Singapore Open from August 25 to 29 and the Indonesia Open in
Denpasar from September 1 to 5.
</P>
<P>
"Normally, a shuttler needs about two months to reach his or
her standard condition. But we'll see how she manages to work out
to achieve her best fitness," Siregar said.

<P>
BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The Information Office of the
State Council of China released here this morning an article
entitled "Facts Speak Louder Than Words and Lies Will Collapse by
Themselves - Further Refutation of the Cox Report".
</P>
<P>
The 25,000-character article is divided into eight parts with
sub-titles of Sensational Lies, Fabrication That Lacks Basic
Knowledge of Science and Technology, Clumsy Distortion of the
Facts, A Story with a Beginning, But No End, Deliberate Distortion
of Normal Scientific, Technological, Economic and Trade Exchanges,
Absurd Logic, Thought Running Counter to Historical Trend, and
Criticism of the Cox Report From the Media and Experts Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
A Select Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives headed
by Republican lawmaker Christopher Cox issued an 872-page report
in May this year, asserting that China obtained secret information
on seven nuclear warheads and the neutron bomb in "two decades of
espionage" at U.S. nuclear weapons laboratories.

I. Sensational Lies
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report inflammatorily accuses China of "stealing"
secret information on the most advanced thermonuclear warheads
possessed by the United States, including the seven types of W-88,
W-87, W-78, W-76, W-70, W-62 and W-56.
</P>
<P>
It claims, "In the late 1970s, the PRC stole design information
on the US W-70 warhead (enhanced radiation nuclear warhead, also
known as the neutron bomb) from the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.
The PRC subsequently tested a neutron bomb in 1988.'' This is a
groundless, vicious slander and a grave calumny on the Chinese
people and Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
As everybody knows, since the 1950s, China has successfully
overcome a series of difficult technological problems and mastered
the nuclear weapon technology within a reasonably short time, by
relying on its own forces, on its large number of talented
scientists full of creative spirit, and on the energetic support
of the people throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
On October 16, 1964, China successfully conducted its first
atom bomb test. On December 28, 1966, it mastered the principle of
hydrogen (H) bomb technology, and on June 17, 1967, it
successfully carried out its first H-bomb test.
</P>
<P>
During this period, China also conducted missile nuclear weapon
tests, initially forming its own nuclear self-defense and counter-
attack strength.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s and 1980s, facing an ever-intensifying nuclear
arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union, and tens
of thousands of nuclear warheads, which, like dark clouds, hung
over the heads of all people in the world and directly threatened
China's safety, China had no other choice but to continue to carry
out research and development of nuclear weapons technology and
improve its nuclear weapons systems, mastering in succession the
neutron bomb design technology and the nuclear weapon
miniaturization technology.

The Cox Report also alleges China "stole" the secrets of the
nuclear explosion tests of miniature fusion and the anti-submarine
microwave technology. This is sheer nonsense.
</P>
<P>
People with even slight scientific and technical knowledge know
that, as early as 1964 when China successfully exploded its first
atom bomb, Wang Ganchang, noted Chinese physicist and academician
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), initially advanced the
concept of laser-based nuclear fusion. He is considered as one of
the earliest scientists in the world who independently put forward
the concept.
</P>
<P>
Following this, China began its systematic research on the
technology of laser-based nuclear fusion.
</P>
<P>
In 1973, one-beam laser was used to drive deuteron ice and a
neutron was observed in the experiment. In 1974, a nuclear
reaction took place through the use of one-beam laser on a drive
target of deuteron polymer, and a D-D reaction to produce a
neutron was observed.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, China adopted the direct driving method to produce a
neutron from a glass target capsule filled with D-T gas. Between
1990-92, through experimentation, thermonuclear fusion reaction
was achieved through the method of indirect driving, and
thermonuclear neutron was observed.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1970s, renowned Chinese theoretical physicist and
CAS academician Yu Min and a group of Chinese scientists under his
leadership advanced the concept of achieving laser fusion through
the method of the X-ray radiation for driving by shooting laser
into a heavy metal shelled cavity through the entrance, and put
forward the structural design of placing target pellets at the
center of the columnar hollow cavity.
</P>
<P>
Between the late 1970s and the 1980s, China manufactured its
own laser device - Shen Guang (magical light) - for research into
laser-based nuclear fusion. Later, it was found from the US
declassified documents that Chinese and American scientists almost
simultaneously advanced a similar concept in their respective
research. This fully indicates that the law governing science
exists objectively, and people all over the world can get hold of
it sooner or later no matter what method is used. If Cox and
others had seriously consulted experts for scientific knowledge,
they would not have made such a silly mistake that only reveals
their lack of general scientific knowledge.

A further fabrication declared: "US scientists have passed
information to the PRC in this way that is of benefit to the PRC's
nuclear weapons program." In fact, the lab-to-lab exchange program
was approved by the governments of the two countries, and the
fields involved were strictly limited to the scope of nuclear
proliferation prevention, arms control and environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
Scientists and officials of the two countries participating in
the lab-to-lab exchange program were all very serious and highly
responsible. They were very clear of where their own country's
security interests lay, and the responsibility they assumed for it.
They would never have touched upon their own countries' nuclear
weapon secrets on such occasion.
</P>
<P>
Some American anti-China politicians' gratuitous accusation of
the Sino-US lab-to-lab exchange program not only sully the dignity
of Chinese scientists, but also damage the dignity of American
scientists.
</P>
<P>
What deserves special mention is that US national laboratories
exercised very strict secret protection and counter-intelligence
policies on the visiting scholars carrying out the lab-to-lab
exchange program.
</P>
<P>
Dr John C. Browne, head of the Los Alamos National Laboratory,
said at a hearing of the US Congress Select Committee on the Sino-
US lab-to-lab exchange program, "All foreign visits and
assignments at the Laboratory are governed by DOE requirements.
From these requirements, the Lab develops the protection
methodology and procedures. Our methodology uses a multi-layer
protection approach consisting of combinations of administrative
and physical controls."
</P>
<P>
Visiting scholars were not allowed to enter secure areas, and
could only enter non-secure areas for work in the company of
personages from the US side. Visiting scholars were not permitted
to use secret computer networks either. It should be pointed out
that all Chinese visiting scholars strictly followed the US side's
secret protection requirements.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report cannot even cite a single example of violations
of the secret protection requirements by any person from the
Chinese side working in US nuclear weapon laboratories. This shows
it was impossible for Chinese visiting scholars to acquire the so-
called "nuclear weapon secret information."
</P>
<P>
As for American scientists and administrative personages who
came to China under the lab-to-lab exchange program, the US side
also had strict management policies.
</P>
<P>
At the same hearing, Dr Browne testified, "Our policy is to
provide 100 percent of our travelers to the PRC with a counter-
intelligence threat awareness briefing including the latest
information regarding the country as possible. Upon return, 100
percent of our travelers are de-briefed regarding their activities
in the PRC with the information provided to all appropriate
government agencies. We have also instituted a policy that
requires more than one US traveler per trip to reduce
opportunities for entrapment."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the US management over delegations to China was
stricter than what Dr Browne stated. The delegations' academic
theses must have been subjected to strict examination. Before the
end of each visit, the visiting delegations must have gone to the
US Embassy in China to report on their activities in the country.
The hotels where delegation members stayed must have been decided,
in principle, by the US side at home. During their visits to China,
delegation members should move collectively.

The Cox Report says, "The PRC first began developing its own
communications satellites in the early 1970s, based on Western
technology."
</P>
<P>
The fact is that, on the founding of New China, the United
States and Western countries began imposing an all-round blockade
and embargo against the country. The Paris-based Coordinating
Committee for Export Control was then established to strictly
restrict high-tech exports to China.
</P>
<P>
Against this historical background, how could China rely on the
United States and Western countries to develop its satellite
technology? The report asserts that China used every means to "
steal" US satellite technology.
</P>
<P>
This is an absurd supposition. As everyone knows, China began
launching US-made satellites in 1990. However, China has since
1970 successfully launched more than 40 domestic satellites of
various types.
</P>
<P>
China now has mature technologies to design and produce
different types of orbital vehicles, such as scientific
experimentation satellites, recoverable satellites, geostationary
orbit communications satellites, and meteorological and earth
resources satellites.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report also claims that the control processor on the
Dongfanghong-III Satellite, developed independently by the Chinese
Academy of Space Technology, was produced by the American company
Matra Marconi Space. Obviously, this is not an error resulting
from the carelessness of those who produced the report.

In 1985, China entered the international commercial launching
market, which by its nature represents an aspect of peaceful use
of space technology and a normal, regular international service
trade. However, the Cox Report asserts that China "stole" or
illegally "acquired" US missile technology through commercial
launches to promote its own missile capability. This not only is
contrary to the facts, but also lacks basic knowledge of science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
People with even slight scientific knowledge will know that a
carrier rocket is developed on the basis of ballistic missiles.
The carrier rocket and missile have different requirements in
terms of guidance precision.
</P>
<P>
The guidance of a rocket is mainly for controlling the orbital
injection precision of satellite, while a missile's guidance
system is to control the deviation during its three major phases
of flight--the powered and unpowered flight phases and the re-
entry phase--so as to ultimately achieve pinpoint accuracy in
delivering the warhead on the selected target.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, a missile requires greater precision in the guidance
system than a carrier rocket. The greater the precision of a
commercial satellite launch, the higher the cost. Generally, out
of consideration of economic rationality, commercial launches do
not require excessively high guidance technology. How can one use
the rocket guidance technology for improving the guidance
precision of missiles?
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report also says that the US carrier rocket fairing
technique China has acquired through commercial satellite launches
"may assist the design and improved reliability of future PRC
MIRVed missiles, if the PRC decides to develop them, and of future
submarine-launched ballistic missiles". In fact, China has mature
experience in fairing design.
</P>
<P>
Prior to 1992, China had already developed two kinds of fairing,
and succeeded in many launches under wind aloft conditions in
winter season. The fairing of the LM-2E China uses in commercial
launches was designed and produced on the basis of 10 successful
flights of that used for the Long March rocket series. China needs
not acquire American fairing technology through commercial
launching services, but has relied on its own strength to
accomplish all improvements and developments.

<P>
The Chinese side accepted the first cause, holding that it is
the resonance of the satellite and the upper stage with the launch
vehicle that caused the failure, while the Hughes Inc. opted for
the second cause, believing that the failure resulted from
insufficient strength of the fairing.
</P>
<P>
The two sides failed to reach a compromise conclusion. It is
normal for either side to announce its analysis results to support
its viewpoint, and this has nothing to do with the question of one
side giving away techniques to the other.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side firmly believes that China has mature
experience in fairing design, and the fairing of the LM-2E was
designed and manufactured on the basis of 10 successful flights of
Long March rockets that were installed with the same type.
Actually, the fairing China still uses on the LM-2C and LM-3
rockets belongs to the same category as that used on Apstar-2
satellite.
</P>
<P>
No reinforcement measures have been adopted, and the ensuing
launches have all been successful. The LM-2C/SD rocket, which
successfully launched two iridium satellites on June 12, 1999,
also used a product of the same category.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report claims that China illegally "acquired" the
satellite mechanical model technique from the United States
through the failure investigation. This is also contrary to the
facts.
</P>
<P>
In order to work on the coupled loads computation of the launch
vehicle and satellite, the latter's manufacturers must provide a
satellite mechanical model. This is used to shrink the satellite
structure, through mathematical means, into a group of data of
totally equal value in mechanics.

After the failure launch, the China Great Wall Industry Corp.,
the major Chinese contractor of international commercial launching
services, released the list of main Chinese astrophysicists who
comprised the failure analysis group, failure investigation
committee and failure examination committee. This was followed
later by the publication of investigation procedures and processes.
</P>
<P>
In late February, the Chinese localized the faults on the
platform and one month later, they defined four possible failure
modes--broken wire of the torque motor of the inner frame,
blocking of the inner frame axis, open circuitry of follow-up
frame and stress failure due to poor environment.
</P>
<P>
Then, they made a further careful study, analysis and test of
the four possibilities one by one, gradually ruling out three of
them. The semi-hardware-in-large-loop simulation test made in mid-
May led to the final conclusion that the open circuitry of the
follow-up frame was the most likely cause of the failure.
</P>
<P>
The intensive analysis and test, as well as dissection
inspection on various components, which were conducted between
June 17 and July 6, localized the fault, leading to a conclusion
that the root cause of the launch failure was the poor bonding
force due to deterioration of the welding quality of the gold-
aluminum bonding point inside the power output module of the
follow-up frame's servo-loop, causing "no current output" from the
loop. The slant of the inertial platform, which eventually led to
the failure, therefore occurred.
</P>
<P>
During the failure investigation, the Chinese side, under
special circumstances and conditions, accepted the IRC consisting
of six experts from the United States, Germany and Britain. At
that time, the failure launch of the LM-3B had seriously affected
follow-up contracts, especially the implementation of the Apstar-
1A contract. According to common international practice,
commercial satellites can be launched only after both the
satellite and the rocket have been insured.
</P>
<P>
International insurance companies had time and again strongly
urged the Chinese side to set up an independent review committee
to assess the results of the failure investigation made by the
Chinese side, which was considered the premise for them to insure
Apstar-1A.

The Cox Report devotes a lot of space to repeatedly stressing
that although the Chinese side confirmed four modes as the
possible cause for the failure at the end of March, it ruled out
two modes including the follow-up frame in April and focused its
research on the inner frame.
</P>
<P>
It says it was not until the IRC "directed" that the Chinese "
abandoned testing of the inner frame", "started vigorously testing
the follower frame", staged the simulation test at the suggestion
of the IRC and finally localized the failure to the follow-up
frame.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the follow-up frame had remained the focus of the
investigation of Chinese scientists. In early April, the Chinese
experts confirmed its failure based on a series of theoretical
analyses.
</P>
<P>
On April 9, they decided to make simulation for the semi-
hardware-in-large-loop of the follow-up frame. From April 16, the
Chinese side began to compile the Simulation Test Guideline (the
Semi-Hardware-in-the-Close-Loop Simulation Test Guideline for the
Four-Axis Inertial Platform Failure Mode) and prepare the method
and conditions for the test.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese experts designed the mathematical models of launch
vehicles, servo-mechanism and rate gyroscope, drew up the flight
software for test purposes, prepared and checked the simulation
test facilities including the test platform, simulation rotation
stand and on-board computer and manufactured some auxiliary items
necessary for the test, such as platform support deck, interface
circuit and cable.
</P>
<P>
It took one month to complete these tasks before the
interference of the IRC. Since the appraisal of the IRC was
derived from the Apstar-1A insurance, and the latter was an
episode in the investigation of China's LM-3B failure, the Chinese
side, following the principle of submitting only the results that
had been proved by test, presented limited materials to the IRC.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, what the IRC learned was only the periodical
result of the failure investigation made by the Chinese side. The
claims in the Cox Report that the Chinese side immediately "
abandoned" testing of the inner frame under the guidance of the
IRC do not accord with the facts. It was in mid-May that the
Chinese side cautiously ruled out the inner frame mode based on
the simulation test and finally confirmed the follow-up frame mode.
</P>
<P>
Its failure investigation was carried out in a scientific way,
relying entirely on its own effort. The failure diagnosis
procedure adopted by the Chinese side had been proved correct by
decades of practice.

Since undertaking commercial satellite launching services, the

<P>
At no time has the US side ever accused the Chinese side of

the launch site and the securing of the satellite to the launch

V. Deliberate Distortion of Normal Scientific, Technological,
Economic and Trade Exchanges
</P>
<P>
China and the United States have developed scientific and
technological exchanges, and economic and trade cooperation, on
the basis of equality and mutual benefits. This conforms to the
interests of the people in both countries and the trend of
historical development as well.
</P>
<P>
In the current world, it is normal for countries to conduct
such exchanges and cooperation. Yet, even these activities have
been subject to deliberate distortion in the Cox Report.
</P>
<P>
On January 31, 1979, China and the United States signed an
inter-governmental agreement on scientific and technological
cooperation. The efforts made by the two countries over the past
two decades have enabled this cooperation to reach a considerable
scale.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, cooperative protocols signed by related departments
of the two countries have covered 33 fields, including education,
agriculture, space, atmosphere, ocean fishing, medicine and health,
earthquake prediction, environmental protection, water resources,
energy efficiency and renewable energy.
</P>
<P>
In the agricultural sector, the two sides have exchanged a
great deal of seed resources. The Chinese side has provided the US
side with more than 2,000 crop species, including many precious
wild species. In the health sector, important medical statistics
and data have been exchanged.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side has provided the US side with the
investigation results of cancer distribution among 240 million
Chinese people across the country, and the Cancer Distribution Map
in China, compiled on the basis of cancer occurrence rate, death
rate and regional distribution, which are proved of great
significance for the United States to make comparative studies and
find ways to prevent and control the disease.
</P>
<P>
The network of seismic stations jointly established by the two
countries enables the United States to obtain 150,000 pieces of
microfiche recording and other data from China, which are of great
value to studies on the causes and formation of earthquakes and to
the improvement of forecasting techniques.
</P>
<P>
Lies in the Cox Report have not only hurt the feeling of
scientists of the two countries, but also affected normal
bilateral scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation.

and technology appears to be insatiable, and the energy devoted to
the task enormous". This is a malicious calumny. Not only does it
have no evidence to support this conclusion throughout the nearly
900 pages, but, on the contrary, it shows that the fabricators of
the Cox Report are insatiably avaricious for and have devoted
great energy to getting hold of China's military technology and
information.
</P>
<P>
Anyone reading the Cox Report will gain such an understanding
that none of the so-called materials substantially listed in the
report from beginning to end provides absolute proof and specific
facts adequately enough to verify its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the report gives a systematic description of China's
nuclear weapons, various guided missiles, satellites, and military
aircraft and vessels, showing the performance indices and
structural sketch maps of some of them, and even giving the
details of research and development process in some cases.
</P>
<P>
The specific models of "Chinese military equipment" mentioned
in the Cox Report include: enhanced radiation weapon (neutron bomb)
; eight kinds of ballistic missiles ranging from CSS-2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8 to CSS-52; DF-31 intercontinental missiles; JL-1 and JL-2
submarine-launched ballistic missiles; C801 and C802 anti-ship
cruise missiles; YH-4 cruise missile; K-8 military aircraft; F-10
fighter; H-11 military helicopter; airborne warning aircraft; FSW,
FSW-1 and FSW-2 photo-reconnaissance satellites; 094 submarine;
and Xia (summer) class ballistic missile nuclear-powered submarine.
</P>
<P>
The report also makes irresponsible comments on China's future
development programs concerning guided missiles, nuclear weapons
and manned space flight. Here, we do not want to say anything
about the so-called "military equipment" and development program
listed in the Cox Report.
</P>
<P>
But this is quite sufficient to show that Cox and others are
hankering after the military secrets of another country. It is a
case of a thief crying "stop thief".

<HEADLINE> Cox Report Further Refuted (32) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In order to be put into operation, a large number of parts had
to be replaced. Since the 19 sets of equipment were second-hand,
the price was only 25 to 30 percent of new ones.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report says that China purchased these machine tools
for the purpose of manufacturing military equipment. This is quite
ridiculous. In fact, China purchased the equipment for use in the
trunk airliner program in consultation with McDonnell Douglas and
for the contracted plane parts program in consultation with both
McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, CATIC planned to set up a machining-oriented
joint venture with the Monitor Corp. of the United States. But the
plan was dropped for commercial reasons. Four of the most advanced
5A3P (5-axis and 3-spindle) gantry profilers among the 19 items
that had acquired US Government export license were not shipped
back to China and were leased to the Monitor Corp. on site.
</P>
<P>
If China intended to divert the equipment to the military use,
it would have surely arranged to get the four most advanced pieces
of equipment rather than leasing them to Monitor. This shows that
Chinese users imported this batch of equipment purely for
commercial profit.
</P>
<P>
The Cox Report seizes upon the fact that the Nanchang Aircraft
Manufacturing Co. opened ahead of time the hydraulic stretch press
package of the 19 sets of equipment, trying to prove that China
imported the equipment for military purpose. In fact, the
hydraulic stretch press was also second-hand equipment made in
1983, and the technology used is not advanced.
</P>
<P>
China could purchase and has already purchased new and more
advanced machine tools with similar properties in the
international market.

<P>
LUSAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Olympics Commonwealth and
All African Games Associaltion (ZOCAGA) has trimmed the number of
participants to the All African Games held in September this year
in South Africa from 119 to between 50 and 60 because of money
shortage.
</P>
<P>
Sports, Youth and Child Development Abel Chambeshi said here
Wednesday that the government have no that kind of money and
therefore had to cut down the number so that reasonable figures
could be found taking into consideration past performance of those
to travel.
</P>
<P>
The government has very little resources to send a team to
South Africa and it will not be in the interest of the country to
send people whose track record is poor or who have not been
practising at all for the events, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chambeshi also said that he will go to Cuba in September this
year to source for equipment and manpower to rekinndle boxing in
his country.
</P>
<P>
Cuba is a powerhouse in boxing and it is for this reason that "
we want to see what help they can give us in terms of equipment
and manpower," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> East China Province to Restructure Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province, one
of the country's economic powerhouses, will expand export of
technology and service to balance its commodity-dominated trade
structure.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Governor Li Chunting said the decision is part of
his province's effort to restructure its foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Shandong now has economic and trade ties with more than 180
countries and regions. Local foreign trade has grown by 15.9
percent annually in the past two decades, with exports rising 13.4
percent per year.
</P>
<P>
The province's imports and exports reached 16.6 billion U.S.
dollars in 1998, accounting for 22.5 percent of local GDP.
</P>
<P>
However, the governor said, the province's imports and exports
have been focused on commodities, with investment, technology and
service making up only a very small amount of the foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
"This lopsidedness of trade is unfavorable to the sound
development of the local economy," Li said.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the province will take measures to increase
technology and service exports. Meanwhile, it will expand
cooperation with multinational trade partners in a bid to gain a
footing in the global sales market.
</P>
<P>
Local enterprises are encouraged to get involved in foreign
trade directly by establishing production lines in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The province will also try to contract more engineering and
labor projects abroad.

<HEADLINE> Chile Timber Exports Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Chile's timber exports throughout
the first five months of the year rose by 4.7 percent to 738.9
million U.S. dollars, compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the National Forestry Corporation (CONAF)
Cristian Palma said Wednesday that the production of the timber
products with higher average prices surged.
</P>
<P>
These items include moldings, battens, locks, doors, windows
and frames, which account for around 30 percent of the total
exports.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the increase of the timber exports have spurred
the Chilean forestry industry.
</P>
<P>
The United States is still the largest importer of the Chilean
timber products with the turnover of 171.3 million dollars, an
increase of 26.7 percent, compared with the January-May period of
last year, said Palma.
</P>
<P>
Japan stood at the second place with 105.9 million dollars,
which represents a fall of 3.7 per cent compared with the same
period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
South Korea held the third place, with 45.4 million dollars, an
increase of 52.6 per cent over last year.
</P>
<P>
China is in the fourth place, with 44.3 million dollars,
followed by Belgium with 43.6 million dollars and Italy with 41.5
million dollars.

QINGDAO, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The coastal city of Qingdao in
east China's Shandong Province approved 301 new overseas-funded
projects in the first half this year, involving 820 million U.S.
dollars of overseas investment, a rise of 6.7 percent and 87.9
percent on a yearly basis respectively.
</P>
<P>
The figures show a bigger scale of the ventures than those set
up a year earlier. According to local sources, 25 of the new
overseas-funded projects each had an investment of more than 10
million U.S. dollars. The big projects were centered on the fields
of household apparatus, chemicals, and machine buildings.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment in local agriculture and service sectors
also climbed up remarkably.
</P>
<P>
During the six-month period, the inflow of overseas money from
Asia doubled that a year earlier, with the amount from the
European Union rising 160 percent year on year and the figure from
the U.S. soaring 170 percent.

The call came alongside a move by the chamber to pass a law

The chamber held that the "totalitarian character of Nazism as
an ideology which promotes hatred and racism" is incompatible with
the country's democratic and republican tradition and is in
contradiction with human dignity.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Record Grain Harvest Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

BRASILIA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's grain harvest during the
1998-1999 period will be 82.117 million tons, 7.3 percent higher
than the 1997-1998 period, said Minister of Agriculture Francisco
Turra Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The National Supply Company associated with the Ministry of
Agriculture estimated that the bean harvest will increase by 34.7
percent over last year and the rice harvest by 35.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The cotton harvest is predicted to increase by 22.7 percent,
oats by 18.1 percent, maize by 6.8 percent and flour by 6.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The crop cultivation area rose by 4.5 percent in comparison
with the 1997-1998 period. At the same time, the ministry also
predicted a 12 percent growth rate for grapes, 4.6 percent for
apples, and 46 percent for coffee.
</P>
<P>
The rise in coffee production will raise Brazil's share to 27
percent in the world output.
</P>
<P>
President of the company Benmedito Rosa believed that Brazil's
harvest will continue to rise this year as 20 percent more loans
will be provided for agricultural projects.

<HEADLINE> Cell Causing Hodgkin's Lymphoma Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A group of American
researchers have discovered the cell that causes Hodgkin's
lymphoma, a disease affecting more than 58,000 people worldwide
per year.
</P>
<P>
Human Genome Sciences (HGSI), a company aimed at discovering
and understanding human and microbial genes, said in a report
Wednesday that in making the discovery, scientists from the
company and other organizations applied new methods to a single
cancer cell to reveal that the Reed-Sternberg cell, the cause of
the disease, originates in B cells, a type of immune cell that
normally produces antibodies.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is described in the July 15 issue of Blood.
</P>
<P>
According to HGSI, the abnormal Reed-Sternberg cell of
Hodgkin's lymphoma has been recognized to be responsible for the
disease. But characterization of the cell itself is difficult as
fewer than one in 1,000 cells of the lymphoma are cancer cells
themselves. The great majority of cell in the lymphoma are normal
immune cells that react to the few cancer cells present in the
tumor.
</P>
<P>
The origin of the Reed-Sternberg cell has been debated ever
since the cell was discovered a century ago. The current study
made two advances in solving the mystery. First micro-dissection
methods made it possible to isolate the Reed-Sternberg cells from
patients' tumor tissues. Second, ultra high-throughput sequence
analysis was used to identify the genes present in the cells. The
study determined a total of more than 11 million nucleotide
sequences, representing 27,000 genes. Then powerful computer
programs were used to compare these genes of the Reed-Sternber
cell with those used in normal human cells.
</P>
<P>
The study provides a clue to why the Reed-Sternberg cells cause
cancer. Normal cells of the immune system contain a self-destruct
system that cause them to die when they begin to grow out of
control. Critical components of the self-destruct system are
missing in the Reed-Sternberg cell.
</P>
<P>
HGSI said that the discovery opens new hope for early diagnosis
and treatment of the disease.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Portugal to Meet at U.N. on East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of
Indonesia and Portugal will meet at the U.N. Headquarters in New
York on Thursday and Friday to review developments related to a
vote on the future of East Timor, the U.N. announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jamsheed Marker, Personal Representative of the U.N.
Secretary-General for East Timor will chair the talks, U.N.
spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will be led by Nugroho Wisnumurti, Director General
of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the
Portugal will be led by Fernando Neves, Director General for
Special Political Questions at the Portuguese Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"They will go over peace and reconciliation efforts in the
territory and will discuss post ballot issues," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the mandate given by an agreement between Indonesia and
Portugal on May 5, the United Nations is organizing and conducting
a "popular consultation" or ballot in East Timor to see whether
the majority of the 800,000 East Timorese want special autonomy
with Indonesia or independence.
</P>
<P>
The original vote date was set for August 8, but U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan delayed it by two weeks last month
for security concerns and better logistics preparations.
</P>
<P>
He also postponed vote registration by 3 days until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The May 5 accord provides for a solution to the dispute between
Indonesia and Portugal over the status of East Timor, a Portuguese
colony until 1975.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia occupied it after a civil rift took place in 1975. It
made the territory a province the following year and since then
the U.N. has been seeking a solution to the status of the
"non-self-governing territory" administered by Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In January, Jakarta put forward a special autonomy package
for East Timor, saying that if the majority of the local people
would like to part, Indonesia will not oppose.

<HEADLINE> European Integration Stalls Italy's South Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, 14 July (Xinhua) -- European integration, widely thought
to be the key to Italy's economic future, is stalling the growth
of the southern regions, a government agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Svimez, the Italian southern development research
agency, "closer ties between the economies of the fifteen European
countries means that the south is having to face competition from
the rest of the EU."
</P>
<P>
The government agency said that the Italian state had not taken
enough measures to invest in the south, and the divide between
north and south was therefore widening.
</P>
<P>
According to the analysis of figures released by Svimez, 1998
was a good year for production, investments and employment in the
south, although the overall picture isn't as good.
</P>
<P>
Svimez said the south's economic results were "not good enough
to change the way things stood in the 1990s."
</P>
<P>
Svimez said that from 1992 to 1998, overall growth in the south
had only reached 2.9 percent, which was less than a third of
growth in the north.
</P>
<P>
It noted that in 1998, unemployment in the south stood at 22.8
percent, a 7 percent increase over 1992. Unemployment in the north
and center of Italy reached 7.4 percent, compared to 6.5 percent
in 1992.

<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Roy Keane has rejected Manchester
United's offer of an extended contract and has repeated his threat
to leave if the club does not meet the player's terms.
</P>
<P>
The Republic of Ireland midfielder is waiting for a new offer
from the club after the he turned down the initial contract
presented to him at the end of last month.
</P>
<P>
Keane, who has one year left on his current contract, could
leave the club next summer as a free transfer under the Bosman
ruling.
</P>
<P>
"If the new contract is not right then I won't sign it," said
the 27-year-old.
</P>
<P>
"I won't undersell myself. I would think that this is my last
big contract so it has got to be right.
</P>
<P>
"Even though I am United's captain, have moved into a new house
and my family are settled here, I won't sign a deal I am not happy
with.
</P>
<P>
"If it isn't sorted out I will have to look at the bigger
picture and I would be prepared to go. That's not a threat, that's
just life," added Keane.
</P>
<P>
Keane, who has not gone on the club tour of Australia, China
and Hong Kong of China, is reported to have asked for two million
pounds a season.
</P>
<P>
The Irishman is currently suffering from a recurrence of his
ankle injury and is likely to miss the Charity Shield against
Arsenal on August 1.
</P>
<P>
"I'm pretty confident I will be fine for the opening
Premiership match at Everton, that's my priority," said Keane.
</P>
<P>
Denis Irwin will skipper United in Keane's absence in their
first pre-season tour match against Australia in Melbourne on
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson Not Keen on Robbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League soccer club
Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has blasted Aston
Villa boss John Gregory's bid to buy teenage prodigy Robbie Keane
from Wolves.
</P>
<P>
Gregory is hoping to push through a six million pounds deal for
the Republic of Ireland international this week but the Manchester
United boss said he would only consider taking the youngster to
Old Trafford if he was available at 500,000 pounds and then he
would only be a reserve.
</P>
<P>
"At six million pounds, I would not go near the player," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If he was 500,000 pounds and could spend time in our second
team I might have a look. But at that price Aston Villa can have
him."
</P>
<P>
Sir Alex's extraordinary tirade is the latest clash between him
and Gregory, which began over United's on-off 12.5 million pounds
signing of Dwight Yorke and continued earlier this year when the
Villa boss predicted United had no chance of winning their
historic Treble.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Ferguson named eight Arsenal players when asked to
pick his all-star Premiership side (excluding his own charges).
</P>
<P>
The United boss chose David Seaman, Martin Keown, Tony Adams,
Nigel Winterburn, Emmanuel Petit, Patrick Vieira, Marc Overmars
and Dennis Bergkamp as well as Chelsea's Albert Ferrer, Tottenham'
s Darren Anderton and Michael Owen, of Liverpool.

<HEADLINE> WTO: United States' Strong Economic Growth Due to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States is enjoying its
second longest period of sustained economic expansion with real
GDP growth averaging over 2.8 percent during the years 1992-96 and
accelerating to 3.9 percent in 1997 and 1998 largely due to the
continued liberalization of trade and investment, said the World
Trade Organization (WTO) here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the new WTO secretariat report on the United States'
trade policies and practices between 1996 and 1998 pointed out
that, in spite of low overall level tariff protection, the United
States maintained some tariff "peaks" (three times the overall
average) on certain agricultural and food products as well as
textiles, clothing and footwear. About one in seven duties are
specific (as opposed to ad valorem).
</P>
<P>
Published after a three-day trade review meeting, the WTO
report said that the United States's economic growth was due in
part to the impetus provided by trade and investment
liberalization resulting from the Uruguay Round Agreements and the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
The report also said that imports have helped to satisfy
domestic demand resulting in lower prices and wider consumer
choice, noting that the openness of the economy has contributed to
improving the competitiveness of U.S. producers, creating more and
better paid jobs.
</P>
<P>
Although the current account deficit was at a record level of
233 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, the report said, the shortfall
in national savings relative to domestic investment was made up by
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
According to the WTO report, the United States is extremely
active in WTO activities: it participated in all post-Uruguay
Round negotiations, including telecommunications and financial
services and played a vital role; the United States is also the
biggest user of the WTO Dispute Settlement system with 48 disputes
filed in the period 1996-98.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the WTO report said that the U.S. case suggested
that trade and investment liberalization support strong economic
performance but warned that any major upsurge in protectionist
measures could impair such performance of the world's biggest
importer and exporter.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Sends Team to Zambia to Prepare for Congo (K) Truce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan is dispatching a three-person team to Lusaka, capital of
Zambia, to work with Zambian President Frederic Chiluba who is
trying to bring rebels to sign the peace accord for Congo (K), a
U.N. spokesman announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general is still prepared to send a full-fledged
technical team to Congo (K) upon the full signing of the peace
agreement, Manoel de Almeida e Silva said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Monday urged rebel leaders in Congo
(K) to sign the ceasefire accord, a condition before any
peacekeepers would be sent to the central African country.
</P>
<P>
Six African nations involved in the 11-month-long conflict
signed on Saturday last week in Lusaka, but rebel groups refused
to do so because of a split within their ranks.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to recommend the Security Council approve of
a peacekeeping force of up to 20,000 soldiers, mainly drawn from
African countries.
</P>
<P>
The complicated conflict in Congo (K) pits rebels in the east,
backed by neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, against President Laurent
Kabila, who was supported by troops from Zimbabwe, Chad, Angola
and Namibia.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Meeting on Peaceful Uses of Outer Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Committee on the
Peaceful Uses of Outer Space started a three-day session in Vienna
Wednesday, to finalize preparations for a U.N. conference on the
similar topics.
</P>
<P>
The Committee session is tackling issues like space debris and
international space law, U.N. spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva
said.
</P>
<P>
The aim is to develop a blueprint for the peaceful uses of
outer space in the next century, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. information, an estimated 8,500 objects
classifiable as space debris are cruising in the geostationary
orbit and low-Earth atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Ways of minimizing the impact of space debris on space missions
is a priority for the U.N. Committee.
</P>
<P>
This becomes especially important when objects with nuclear
power sources aboard are taken into consideration.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes Wye Accord Implemented with Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday that it hopes the Wye agreement, reached last October
between Israel and the Palestinians, would be carried out without
changes.
</P>
<P>
"We're not suggesting that the agreement should be changed,"
State Department spokesman James Rubin said at a regular
briefing. "On the contrary, we think that both sides should
implement the agreement ... It can and should be implemented now."
</P>
<P>
Rubin was reacting to Israel's new Prime Minister Ehud Barak
who said he favored either partial implementation or
amalgamating various Israel withdrawals from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Full implementation now is too risky," he told the New York
Times in an interview on the eve of his departure to Washington.
"It would reduce our chances of achieving a permanent peace."
</P>
<P>
To the Washington Post, he said it would be preferable to
stage Israel's withdrawal from Palestinian areas in one big step
as part of a single peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Wye agreement, under which Israel would pull out of 13
percent of more territory from the West Bank, was suspended last
December by former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration was eager to see the agreement
fully carried out so as to push peace process in the Middle East
forward.
</P>
<P>
Rubin indicated small amendments could be made but on the
condition that both Israel and the Palestinians would accept
them.
</P>
<P>
"If there is some desire to make modest adjustments and both
sides agree to them we would not stand in the way of that. But
in the meantime it is our view that the agreement should be
implemented as signed," he said.

<HEADLINE> 2.5 Million Italian Family Live in Poverty, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, 14 July (Xinhua) -- More than 2.5 million families in
Italy are considered poor, Italian National Statistics Bureau
Istat declared in a report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Istat defines a two-member family as poor if it spends less per
month than the national average per capita.
</P>
<P>
The cut-off for 1998 was 1,476 million lire (about 775 U.S.
dollars) a month, up from 1,430 million lire in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Istat said that 7,423 million individuals, equivalent to 11.8
percent of the population, lived below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
It noted that 65 out of every 100 poor families lived on the
southern peninsula, Sicily or Sardinia, and said that large
families were more likely to be affected, with 22.7 percent of
families of five or more considered poor, the figure rising to 34
percent in the south.
</P>
<P>
Levels of education also seemed to have an effect on living
conditions, with poverty affecting 18.7 percent of families whose
main breadwinner did not have a university degree, whereas only
0.9 percent of families of graduates were considered poor in the
north, 3.1 percent in central Italy and 8.2 percent in the south.
</P>
<P>
Istat declared, however, that the overall situation in southern
and northern regions had improved slightly compared to the
previous year, but noted a worsening of conditions in central
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Italian Social Affairs Minister Liva Turco declared that a fund
of at least 1 trillion lire ( about 520 million U.S. dollars)
would be set up to fight poverty in the country.
</P>
<P>
On hand when Istat statistics on poverty were released, Turco
said the fact that poverty had fallen slightly in 1998 was an
encouraging sign, but noted that "the fight against poverty
remains one of the center-left government's top priorities."
</P>
<P>
She said the government intended to follow through on its
financial aid plan for large families. Turco also called for more
measures to be taken to improve public services as well as for a
more positive employment policy towards women.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls But Other Indexes Rise On Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average moved lower Wednesday as investors took profits from the
big gains in recent trading sessions.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip stocks closed down 26.92 at 11,148.10, adding
to its 26 point drop Tuesday. The Dow was also dragged lower by
fears of political tensions in Asia provoked by the Taiwanese
leader's separatist remarks and concerns about worsening
economic situation in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
But the technology heavy Nasdaq index was pushed higher by a
tame inflation report and a strong earnings outlook from
computer chip maker Intel. The index rose 39.90 at 2,818.13,
surpassing the record closing high of 2,793.07, set last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose just 0.1
percent in June while the Labor Department reported the Producer
Price Index fell a smaller-than-expected 0.1 percent in the same
month. Intel said late Tuesday its second-quarter earnings
jumped 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 4.61 at 1,398.17 and the NYSE index rose
1.26 at 654.90.
</P>
<P>
The American Stock Exchange index rose 0.67 at 813.00 and
the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.35 at 461.46.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,536 up, 1,398 down and
602 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 745.53 million shares from 733.78
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Eating While Watch TV Bad For Health, Italian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, 14 July (Xinhua) -- Two out of three Italian families eat
dinner while watching television, causing them to eat more as well
as to have digestive problems, Italian health experts said.
</P>
<P>
A survey, which was carried out by Italian market research
company IMS, said that up to 80 percent of single people ate and
watched TV at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Daniela Marafante, one of fifty health experts questioned by
the research company, said that people who watch television while
eating pay less attention to the food they are about to eat.
</P>
<P>
"Television leads people to eat more than they should, as it
tends to anesthetize them," she explained.
</P>
<P>
And according to Michele Carruba, president of Italy's national
health and science organization, "watching television makes it
impossible to realize that you are full."
</P>
<P>
Explaining why many people eat whenever they sit down in front
of their television sets, Raffaele Morelli, editor of a health
magazine said: "TV activates a process of association between
eating and watching a film, in the same way that some people link
coffee with a cigarette."
