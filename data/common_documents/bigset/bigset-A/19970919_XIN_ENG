<HEADLINE> Japan's NO. 2 Opposition Party Launches Single Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Party of Japan
(DPJ) has shifted to a single leadership under Naoto Kan, former
Health and Welfare Minister and one of DPJ's two co-leaders.
</P>
<P>
At a plenum today, DPJ members of both houses of the Diet
(parliament) nominated Yukio Hatoyama, the other co-leader, as the
DPJ's secretary general, said a Kyodo News Service report.
</P>
<P>
Kan and Hatoyama, both 50, had shared DPJ's power since its
founding last September, but the party had been under criticism
for ambiguity over who is ultimately responsible for its decisions.
</P>
<P>
DPJ, the second largest opposition party in Japan, aims to
consolidate its position through Kan, who is popular with the
public, the Kyodo report quoted DPJ lawmakers as saying.
</P>
<P>
As health minister, Kan spared no efforts last year to reveal
the 1980s scandal involving blood products contaminated with the
AIDS-causing Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).

<HEADLINE> EU Asks WTO to Rule on S. Korean Liquor Taxation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
today asked the World Trade Organization (WTO) to arbitrate over
South Korea's heavy taxation on alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
A formal EU request is expected to be made by the European
Commission, the 15-member regional trade bloc's executive agency,
at the next meeting of the WTO dispute settlement board.
</P>
<P>
At dispute was the wide gap between the tax rates imposed on
imported spirits and on local products in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Although South Korea has narrowed since 1993, the tax gap
between local alcoholic beverage of soju and imported spirits, a
significant difference still remains, the EU commission alleged.
</P>
<P>
Imported whisky and brandy faces 100-percent tax whereas local
soju faces only 35-percent tax.
</P>
<P>
The EU will use the WTO to open markets in countries that
"unfairly discriminate against European exports," said European
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan, who is in charge of external trade.
</P>
<P>
Through the WTO, he said, the EU has succeeded in forcing
changes to Japan's liquor tax laws and it is to follow the same
route to secure its rights in the growing South Korean market.
</P>
<P>
"The WTO is there to remove unfair barriers to our exports and
we must continue to use it as such," Brittan said.
</P>
<P>
European exports of spirits stood at some 4,000 million ECU a
year and the alcohol distilling industry employs some 50,000
people among the EU countries.

<HEADLINE> ACP Summit to Weigh Post-Lome Options </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The African, Caribbean and
Pacific (ACP) states will hold a summit in Libreville, Gabon, to
work out strategies to negotiate relations with the European
Union (EU) after the expiry of the Lome IV Convention in 2000.
</P>
<P>
EU agricultural advisor Jens Laerke told the Zimbabwe News
Agency today that leaders and key ministers from all the ACP
states will attend the two-day summit meeting starting on
November 6 to discuss relations with the EU after Lome IV.
</P>
<P>
In outlining options for the way forward, Laerke said there is
need for new trade arrangements consistent with the strategic
choices made by the ACP countries in their bid to integrate into
the world economy.
</P>
<P>
"In most ACP countries, the economic and institutional
environment has not been conducive to the development of a
competitive private sector and the growth of investment or
diversification of production," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result they have not been able to take advantage of all
the opportunities offered by the special preferences granted
under the Lome Convention," he said.
</P>
<P>
ACP exports to the EU have been no exception to those
countries' generally poor trade performance, and their share of
the EU market declined from 6.7 percent in 1976 to 2.8 percent in
1994.
</P>
<P>
For the future, he said, there are various options involving
one or more trade regimes.
</P>
<P>
"They should be assessed in terms of their implications for
ACP-EU relations and whether they can help the ACP countries
diversify their external economic relations and avoid the risk of
growing marginalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation at sub-regional level or by groups of countries
will significantly streamline negotiations, which at present
takes place only at bilateral level, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Such an initiative, he said, will give a significant stimulus
to private investment.
</P>
<P>
Laerke suggested the EU could have a fresh look at aid
instruments.
</P>
<P>
"The Lome Convention today provides for a wide range of
instruments designed to achieve specific objectives and subject
to different, sometimes complicated, management procedures. Their
simultaneous use in the same country makes EU policy less than
transparent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Laerke suggested that the EU could switch to offering overall
financial packages, retaining the distinction between crisis
situations and long-term operations and between public and
private sector operations. Endite

KUWAIT, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Defending Champions China was
upset by South Korea 86-72 in the semifinal and lost their dream
for a record-setting sixth straight title at the Asian Men's
Basketball Championship in Riyadh on Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was the second semifinal defeat for China in their 12
outings in the continental tournament, where they have won the
title for 10 times. The only other semifinal winner over China was
the Philippines in 1986.

China, led the first half by 42-36, lost their longrang
shooting power in the second half while the South Koreans hit six
three pointers to rally at 74-68 with eight minutes on the clock.

<HEADLINE> Differences Remain Between Spain, Sweden Over EU Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Differences remain between
Spain and Sweden over a German proposal for lowering the shares of
cost for expanding the European Union's (EU) into Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
It appeared that Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson and his
Spanish counterpart Jose Maria Aznar failed to come closer on the
issue in their talks Wednesday, Swedish media reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Aznar, here on a two-day official visit, hoped to convince
Sweden into supporting Spain's opposition to the German proposal.
</P>
<P>
But the Swedish prime minister reportedly said during the
meeting that Sweden has made larger contributions to the EU than
what it has got back from the 15-member regional trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
Sweden was interested in bringing down the EU's expenditure and
therefore was prepared to study the German proposal, he said.

<HEADLINE> WHO Hails Success in Developing Two New Types of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) announced here today that years of research on polio have
led to two new types of vaccine tests based on bioengineering
(transgenic mice) and molecular biology (MAPREC assay).
</P>
<P>
"A pioneering bioengineering technology brought off another
first, a new strain of transgenic (foreign gene) mice has been
developed that can successfully be used for vaccine quality
control," said Dr Ralph Henderson, WHO Assistant Director-General.
"The new technology offers great promise of advancing our
knowledge related to the prevention or treatment of certain
infectious diseases."
</P>
<P>
The transgenic mice test was developed by scientists working on
a WHO-coordinated research project to genetically engineer a mouse
that is susceptible to poliovirus. Normally, poliovirus will not
grow in mice, so monkeys have to be used to test the quality of
vaccine lots. The isolation of the human gene coding for the
poliovirus receptor made it possible for this human receptor to be
transplanted to mice. When infected with polioviruses, transgenic
mice develop clinical signs and changes in the central nervous
system similar to those observed in primates.
</P>
<P>
The second new test, the MAPREC assay, also developed through a
WHO-coordinated study, is an equally impressive achievement. It
hinges on the discovery by molecular biologists of the secret of
the weakened forms of poliovirus in the oral polio vaccine used in
the highly successful WHO polio eradication initiative. It turns
out that a small number of mutations of specific points in the
virus genetic code are responsible for the weakened character of
the vaccine. The MAPREC assay measures changes at these key
mutations in vaccine batches. Variation above a certain threshold
means a vaccine batch is unsuitable for use.
</P>
<P>
The MAPREC assay could be applied before vaccines are tested on
animals. This should lead to a reduction in animal usage since
unsuitable batches of vaccine would be rejected at this stage.
</P>
<P>
"We have obtained wonderful results but in order to be
confident that the tests can be applied globally, additional data
ought to be collected before the WHO Expert Committee on
Biological Standardization meets in Geneva in a year's time to
pronounce its verdict on the use of both new tests for quality
control of oral polio vaccine," WHO Deputy Director-General Dr
Fernando Antezana explained.

LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The people of Wales began
voting today in a historic referendum to decide whether Wales
should have its own devolved assembly.
</P>
<P>
If such an assembly were produced in Cardiff, the capital of
Wales, at the turn of the century, as the British government
proposed, the assembly would control a budget of 7 billion pounds
(11 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It would also become responsible for major public services in
Wales, but would hold no sway over finance, foreign affairs,
defense or law and order.
</P>
<P>
The results of the voting, which went on from 0600 GMT to 2100
GMT, is expected to come out early on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that opinion polls in the running-up to the
referendum pointed to a narrow majority who support greater
autonomy of Wales and a huge number of Wales' 2.2 million voters
were still undecided.
</P>
<P>
The vote followed last Thursday's Scottish home rule
referendum, in which Scotland voted by a three to one margin in
favor of creating its own parliament.
</P>
<P>
Wales was annexed to England in 1536 and has not had its own
assembly since early in the 15th century.

<HEADLINE> UK Farmers Welcome EU Vets' Proposal on Beef Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain's National Farmers'
Union (NFU) Thursday welcomed European Union (EU) veterinary
experts' proposal to partially lift the 18-month old ban on
British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The EU Scientific Veterinary Committee Wednesday endorsed a
proposal which said that beef exports could be permitted where a
computerized database of cattle movements existed and showed that
there was no risk of BSE, or mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing, NFU president David Naish welcomed
the proposal, saying that "we have opened the door, lifted the
curtain" and he had no difficulties with the plan so long as it
contributed to the total removal of the ban.
</P>
<P>
However, Naish also pressed for further progress, adding that
it was only a first step and much more needed to be done to end
the blanket ban.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that farmers in Northern Ireland would
initially benefit from the committee's proposal as BSE is rare
there and a computerised cattle tracking system has existed there
for several years.
</P>
<P>
A computer database is being set up for mainland Britain but
will not be ready until spring.
</P>
<P>
Naish also pressed the UK government to formally present to
Brussels a separate proposal allowing exports of beef from cattle
born after August 1 last year, when contaminated feed, thought to
have caused the BSE epidemic, had been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The committee's recommendation has to be approved by a majority
of the other 14 EU member states before any exports could be
permitted.

PARIS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The French government today
appointed a veteran air company manager as the new president of
the Air France to replace Christian Blanc, who resigned from his
post to protest government's refusal to privatize the national
carrier.

Jean-Cyril Spinetta, who was appointed by Prime Minister Lionel

the designation of Mr. Jean-Cyril Spinetta...in order to confide
to him the presidency of Air France" next week.

Agence France-Presse said that Spinetta, 54, is an ardent

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- German telecom giant Deutsche
Telekom today said its pre-tax profits surged by 33 percent to 3.6
billion marks (2 billion U.S. dollars) in the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The company achieved a revenue of 32.9 billion marks (18.6
billion dollars), 7.3 percent up over the same period last year,
Deutsche Telekom chairman Ron Sommer told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
It also brought the group financial debts down by 3.5 percent
through reduction of its employees, said Sommer, who took the
chance to announce a 5 percent cut on phone bills next Spring.
</P>
<P>
However, he criticized the decision by Postal Minister Wolfgang
Boetsch that competitors could pay an average of 2.7 pfennigs (1.5
cents) per minute for access to Telekom's network.
</P>
<P>
After the decision was announced last week, the stock of
Telekom, which is asking for 5-7 pfennigs (2.8-3.9 cents) per
minute, has fallen by 7.7 percent in latest trading.
</P>
<P>
Sommer vowed to adopt legal steps to fight the decision of
Bonn, which he said would disrupt competition and was clearly at
the expense of his company.

<HEADLINE> Franco-German Summit to Focus on Job, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- French officials said the 70th
Franco-German summit, to be opened later today in the eastern
German city of Weimar, will focus on job, Euro and culture.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit will be attended by German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany, burdened with a 12.5 percent and 11.4
percent jobless rate respectively, will first discuss the
preparation for a European Union's meeting on unemployment to be
held in Luxembourg in November.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are at odds over how to deal with the
unemployment problem.
</P>
<P>
Germany insists that it is up to the governments to solve the
unemployment problem in their own countries, while France hopes
the EU could have a fund for helping create jobs.
</P>
<P>
Both France and Germany are satisfied that next April and May
are set as the deadline for setting the bilateral exchange rates
between the currencies of EU countries which are qualified for the
single European currency.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German daily Thuringische
Landeszeitung published today, Jospin warned that a delay in the
launching of euro will bring "heavy negative consequences" in the
political and economic fields of Europe.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed his government's readiness to reach the single
currency criteria of less than 3 percent deficit-to-gross domestic
product (GDP) ratio.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda of the summit will be the reduction of
Germany's financial contribution to the EU, reform of EU
agricultural policy, the EU enlargement and the restructuring of
the Airbus consortium.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two countries will also sign a series of
cultural agreement, including the creation of Franco-German
University "without wall," which will be joined by French and
German faculties interested in common subjects of research and
will issue degrees to French and German students.
</P>
<P>
Kohl will organize a welcoming ceremony for Chirac and Jospin
with a military guard of honor at the medieval marketplace of
Weimar.
</P>
<P>
They will hold talks, drink beer and eat Bavarian sausages
together on Friday and will end their summit by attending a
concert.

<HEADLINE> Air Crash Passengers Trapped in Seats in Atlantic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The passengers and crew
on board the German and American military planes believed to have
collided off the Namibian coast may still be trapped in their
seats at the bottom of the sea, a South African airforce
spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
The airforce sdpokesman Laverne Machine said in Pretoria that
this possible conclusion is based on the fact that no more bodies
have been found.
</P>
<P>
An American airforce cargo plane and a German military
transport aircraft crashed off the northern Namibian coast on
September 13.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said after four-day multi-nation search
operation, only one body of a woman form the German aircraft, has
been retrieved so far.
</P>
<P>
He said one explanation is the wreckage of both planes sank
more or less intact, with the people on board still trapped.
</P>
<P>
The German plane was carrying 24 people to a naval ceremony in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. aircraft, with nine crew members on board, was on its
way home from Namibia where it had dropped mine-clearing
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The two planes vanished at about the same time from radar
screens and went down in an area 50 kilometres south of the mouth
of the Kunene River at the Angolan-Namibian border, and 90
kilometres off the coast.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Fact-finding Body to Continue Working </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 18 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's cabinet
has approved proposals to extend the life of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) by four months to allow it to
complete its work, Archbishop Desmond Tutu said today.
</P>
<P>
TRC, as a fact-finding group authorized by the government to
investigate all violent activities during the apartheid era, has
right to grant amnesty to people who were involved in violent
activities prior to abolition of apartheid and applied for
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
"We now intended to deliver our final report to the government
at the end of July next year, instead of mid-March," Tutu,
chairman of the commission, told a press conference in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the extension, Tutu said, is firstly to ensure
that the victims and survivors of gross human rights violations,
who had approached the commission, will be able to have their
cases finalized.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he said, it is to have the amnesty process
completed during the life of the full commission, and to include
a full report on the work of the Amnesty Committee in the TRC's
final report.
</P>
<P>
About 14,000 people reportedly had made statements to the
fact-finding group so far and more were expected, Tutu said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Shoots Up in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit in
July hiked by 24.7 percent to 10.3 billion U.S. dollars from June,
the worst showing since a deficit of 11.6 billion dollars was
recorded in January, said the Commerce Department today.
</P>
<P>
In July, the U.S. exports dipped 1.4 percent to 77.4 billion
dollars, as a result of lower sales of agricultural products,
industrial engines and artwork. Imports rose by 1.1 percent to a
record 87.7 billion dollars as foreign cars and parts shipped to
this country hit an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit with Japan surged 27.3 percent to 5.2
billion dollars, the worst performance since June 1995.
</P>
<P>
The imports from Japan increased 629 million dollars, more than
half of which was attributed to by more car imports, while
U.S. exports to Japan fell by 478 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's deficit with Mexico narrowed by 17.8
percent to 987 million dollars, the smallest imbalance since
January 1995.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit with Western Europe in July jumped
five-fold to 4.3 billion dollars, the worst showing since July
1996, when America's deficits with Germany, Italy and France all
set records.
</P>
<P>
The country's oil imports decreased 4.1 percent in July to 5.7
billion dollars as price per barrel of crude oil dropped to 16.50
dollars, the lowest level since February 1966.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the U.S. deficit in goods and services is
running at an annual rate of 113.6 billion dollars, which could
surpass last year's 111 billion dollar imbalance which had been
the worst showing in eight years.

<HEADLINE> Alternative Smoking-Cessation Method to be Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Conference
on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) will hold a seminar here next
week to examine the social and economic impact from using
Alternative Nicotine Delivery Systems (ANDS) against smoking.
</P>
<P>
Smokers' dependency on nicotine has recently been recognized by
medical authorities as a narcotic addiction, like heroine or
cocaine dependency, UNCTAD said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
ANDS, like nicotine-containing chewing gums and trans-dermal
patches, are meant primarily for temporary nicotine delivery
during a smoking-cessation.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD claims that increased use of ANDS instead of smoking
will entail less smoking-related harm to health of both the
smokers and non-smokers in indoor environment and there will also
be economic consequences of such a development.
</P>
<P>
Eminent experts from fields of pharmacology, medical science,
public health, psychiatry, business, economics and regulation of
sales of pharmaceuticals will attend the seminar from September 22
to 24.

<HEADLINE> Canada Sees Record Foreign Trade in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Automotive products and
industrial goods drove Canada's exports up 2.8 percent to a record
25.1 billion Canadian dollars (18 billion U.S. dollars) in July,
Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
The country's imports, after a slight decline in the second
quarter, reached a record level of 23.4 billion Canadian dollars
(16.8 billion dollars) in July, a 5.2 percent increase over June.
</P>
<P>
In July, Canada saw a trade surplus of 1.7 billion Canadian
dollars (1.2 billion dollars), the lowest since August 1994, the
statistics agency said.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the decline can be attributed to strong import growth
in business investment related goods and falling energy exports,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, Canada has reaped a trade surplus of 15.6
billion Canadian dollars (11.2 billion dollars), compared with
25.2 billion Canadian dollars (18.1 billion dollars) for the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
In July, automotive exports jumped 12.9 percent after declining
6.0 percent in June. Strong exports of passenger vehicles and
motor vehicle parts contributed to the gain.
</P>
<P>
Industrial goods exports increased 6.0 percent for the month,
while exports of forestry products declined 3.1 percent,
continuing the downward trend that began in January.
</P>
<P>
On the import front, the main contributors to the 5.2-percent
increase are machinery and equipment (up 9.0 percent), energy
products (up 20.7 percent) and industrial goods (2.8 percent), the
agency said.

CAIRO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Interior Ministry said
that one of the attackers of a tourist bus in downtown Cairo
earlier today is insane.
</P>

Nine German tourists were killed and another nine foreign
tourists injured as their bus was attacked at noon today. Two of
the assailants, identified as Saber Mahmoud Farahat Abul Ela and
his brother Mahmoud were wounded and arrested, while the third

kerosene.

<P>
At least 33 tourists were in the bus as the bomb went off,
according to Mamdouh Al-Gohari, director of Spring Tours Company,
owner of the bus. The white bus was gutted black from inside and
its glass windows were all shattered.
</P>
<P>
Police said that they saw one of the gunmen placed a bag under
the bus while another threw a Molotov cocktail at it as the group
of tourists were leaving the bus to visit the museum.
</P>
<P>
Six of the injured underwent urgent operations immediately
after their arrival at the nearby Kasr al-Eini Hospital while
others suffering deep wounds and fractures were treated.
</P>
<P>
The attack seemed so timed and planned as to create utmost
upheaval in Cairo's most crowded commercial and business center,
said the Cairo governor.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman of Germany declined to comment on
any likely measures Bonn would take in the wake of today's
tragedy. Germany is the number one source of tourists for Egypt,
with some 460,000 people coming to visit annually.
</P>
<P>
The attack shocked foreign tourists in the vicinity, some
sobbed. They were ushered away from the Museum, a usually
heavily-guarded treasure trove of Pharaonic relics.
</P>
<P>
An Australian, identified herself only as Laura, told Xinhua
that the police and the attackers exchanged fire. "Just minutes,
explosions, fire, bullets, and hell... I was waiting at the gate
for others to come out (of the museum)."
</P>
<P>
The police, equipped with anti-riot gears and automatic rifles,
cordoned off the roads leading to the scene, the city's central
transit point, paralyzing traffic for hours.
</P>
<P>
The area was being combed in search of any of their cohorts and
to secure it from any further possible bomb threats, according to
the police.
</P>
<P>
A police officer, on condition of anonymity, said that the
attackers were wearing business suits in an apparent attempt to
avoid attention in the super-crowded city center that hosts a
number of government offices and plush hotels.
</P>
<P>
The attack was probably in response to the country's single
largest trial three days ago of 98 Muslim militants.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian military tribunal condemned to death four Muslims
and meted out various prison terms for 69 others convicted of
staging major terrorist attacks to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
In a five-year campaign launched by Muslim militants against
the secular government, nearly 1,200 people have been killed,
including tourists, police officers and civilians. Most of the
attacks took place in Upper Egypt, hideouts for most militants.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996, Muslim militants attacked a group of Greek
tourists in Cairo's Europa Hotel, killing 18 and injuring 16.

A statement by the foreign ministry said Ikimi will lead the
ECOWAS (the Economic Community of West African States) committee
of five on Sierra Leone in discussion with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan and the Security Council on the development in the
country.
</P>
<P>
At the recent summit in Nigerian capital Abuja, ECOWAS leaders
approved sanctions and blockade against Sierra Leone to force out
the military government which seized power from elected President
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in a coup on May 25.
</P>
<P>
The leaders had asked the U.N. and the international community
to do the same. But it is understood that the U.N. has not
nodded to the request so far.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Ikimi will also observe the
special session of the U.N. Security Council on Africa scheduled
for September 25.
</P>
<P>
Besides the issue of strengthening the cooperation between
U.N. and African countries, the special session is also expected
to focus on the reform of the U.N., including the expansion of
the permanent membership of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been promoting itself as the one African country
that should be recruited as a permanent member of the Security
Council.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Not Homeland for Palestinians: King Hussein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan today
said that Jordan would not accept the Palestinians as permanent
residents in the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom would not be a substitute homeland for the
Palestinians, said the king while inspecting the southern areas
as part of his national tour to contact the Jordanian people,
Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
Hussein also stressed the importance for the Palestinians to
achieve their rights on their own national soil, namely the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, Hussein and Jordanian
government officials have repeatedly emphasized that the
Palestinians should not settle down in Jordan, but in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
They made the remarks amid reports that Israel had a plan to
drive Palestinians in Israel, living in areas other than the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, to Jordan, by paying the Kingdom a great sum
of money for the scheme.
</P>
<P>
The reports triggered fears among the Jordanians who believe
permanent residence of the Palestinians in Jordan might pose
serious threat to the country with a population of 4.2 million and
is lack of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Jordan now hosts about 1 million Palestinian refugees, 225,000
of which living in 13 refugee camps. The Kingdom allocated
350 million U.S. dollars for the refugees this year.

<HEADLINE> Syria President Pessimistic About Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
today expressed pessimism over the future of the Mideast peace but
he said that Syria is willing to talk with Israel on the fate of
the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Assad, who paid a lightning visit to Egypt today, made the
statement after a meeting with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni
Mubarak in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, the second
largest city of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"Syria is willing to reach an understanding with Israel," he
said, commenting on an Israeli conception of security arrangements
in the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau seized by the Jewish
state in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
"But peace is not mere words. Rather it should have content and
meaning that can materialize," he added.
</P>
<P>
Assad said there is no sign of optimism looming over the
horizon since Benjamin Netanyahu was elected Israeli Prime
Minister in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
"We work and hold discussions in order to reach results and
realize our wishes. As you know, conditions for peace do not exist
at present," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian president stressed that his country continued to
adhere to the peace process but blamed Netanyahu as "the one who
obstructed the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu insists on the precedence of Israeli security over
peace and rejects withdrawal of its troops from the Golan Heights
as promised by his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
Assad urged the Netanyahu government to comply with the
land-for-peace principle, implement its pledge to pull out its
troops and resume the talks from the point the two sides had
reached at.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak joined Assad in noting that U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has asserted in her recent tour of the Mideast
that the peace process should be resumed on the basis of Madrid
conference.
</P>
<P>
"The Arabs are with peace," said Assad, expressing hope that
Albright's visit would prove successful.
</P>
<P>
During a short stay in Syrian capital Damascus last week,
Albright failed to bring Israel and Syria to negotiations after a
18-month freeze.
</P>
<P>
Assad left Alexandria for home this evening.

MOSCOW, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Ministry today
praised China's decision to decline an offer from Chechnya to
exchange "official representatives".
</P>
<P>
The Interfax quoted spokesman of the Foreign Ministry Gennady

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Restrictions on Methyl Bromide Tightened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Ninth Meeting of the
Parties to the Montreal Protocol has agreed to strengthen
controls on methyl bromide and illegal chlorofluorocarbon trade.
</P>
<P>
A news release issued here today said the meeting sponsored by
the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has agreed on a
phase-out schedule for methyl bromide, a fumigant which was the
most important ozone-depleting substance.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the phase-out by developed countries has
to be completed by the year 2005 instead of 2010 with exemptions
for "critical uses".
</P>
<P>
The interim reduction of methyl bromide for developed
countries is scheduled to be 25 percent by 1999, 50 percent by
2001 and 70 percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries, previously committed only to a freeze by
2002, have agreed to a 20 percent four-year average of 1995-1998
as the base year for calculating the phase-out.
</P>
<P>
The interim reduction schedule for developing countries will
be reviewed in 2003, according to the agreement reached at a
two-day meeting in Montreal, Canada which ended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 participants from some 110 countries agreed at
the meeting that UNEP would make 25 million U.S. Dollars
available each year in both 1998 and 1999 for activities to help
phase out methyl bromide in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Last year an agreement was reached on providing 10 million
Dollars to developing countries for funding demonstration
projects testing the feasibility of methyl bromide alternatives.
</P>
<P>
The meeting which was held to mark the 10th anniversary of the
Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer,
decided to set up a licensing system to help governments track
international trade in chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other
controlled substances.
</P>
<P>
The new licensing system for controlling trade will be based
on licenses issued by parties for each import and export and on
regular information exchange between parties.
</P>
<P>
The new system which will become effective at the start of
2000 will enable customs and police officials to track trade in
CFCs and to detect unlicensed trade.
</P>
<P>
Another decision adopted by the meeting requests developed
countries to consider banning the sale of their stockpiles of
virgin CFCs anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony of the 10th anniversary included the presentation
of 23 "ozone awards" to individuals and organizations that have
made outstanding contributions to ozone protection.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senator Asks More Explanation on NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Chairman Jesse Helms of
the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations requested the administration to
give more explanation on the expansion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) before the Senate approves it.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, released
to the media today, Helms said he was willing to help the
administration secure Senate ratification for the alliance's
expansion.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that first the administration must offer a
clear military rationale for expansion, extract promises that
other member states will pay their fair share of the costs and set
clear limits to Russian interference in NATO decisions.
</P>
<P>
Helms has invited Albright to appear before his committee on
October 7 to address his concerns and those of other members about
the strategic rationale for expansion.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the department
welcomed Helms's conditional support for ratification and looked
forward to discussing his concerns.
</P>
<P>
"It is my desire to be helpful to you in achieving Senate
ratification of NATO expansion," Helms wrote in the letter.
</P>
<P>
"The administration must now outline a clear, strategic,
military rationale for NATO enlargement that identifies the
threats the alliance may face in the coming century and why an
enlarged NATO is necessary to counter (them)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Helms said he hoped the hearing would build enough support in
the Senate for ratification.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member NATO leaders agreed in July in Madrid to accept
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic as new members. The
agreement needs to be approved by each member nation's parliament.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Erupts in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 18 (Xinhua) -- A fierce fighting between
Israeli troops and Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas erupted today
in south Lebanon, killing one Israeli soldier and wounding three
others as well as five Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese official National News Agency quoted a
statement issued by Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
as saying that its guerrillas launched more than 25 attacks on
the positions of Israeli force and its ally, the South Lebanese
Army (SLA), in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The attacks were the revenge for the six Lebanese Army
soldiers who were killed in last Saturday's clash with Israeli
troops, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It added that the attacks in which missiles, heavy machine-guns
and rockets were used caused direct casualties to Israelis. But it
did not mention the exact number of the dead and injuried.
</P>
<P>
Israel radio has confirmed that one Israeli soldier had been
killed and three others wounded.
</P>
<P>
According to the agency's report, Israeli troops responded to
the attacks by bombing the whole area of its occupied "security
zone", a 1,100-square-meter border enclave in south Lebanon set up
by Israel in 1985, and villages of Nabatieh al-Fawqa which faces
the enclave.
</P>
<P>
The bombs used by Israelis were of the flechette variety which
scatter hundreds of steel darts when they explode. Flechette
shells are anti-personnel weapons banned under the terms of the
Geneva convention.
</P>
<P>
The shelling wounded several civilians in Nabatieh al-Fawqa,
and damaged rooms and cars, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Wholesale Up 2.1 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Total sales by wholesalers in
Canada increased 2.1 percent to 24.1 billion dollars (17.3 billion
USD) in July, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
That was another strong month for Canadian wholesalers,
continuing the upward trend that began in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
After the flat 1995, total wholesales in Canada has increased
by 20.4 percent since January 1996, the federal statistics agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Total wholesales were up in 9 of the 11 trade groups in July.
The largest increases were reported by wholesalers of beverage,
drug and tobacco products (up 7.2 percent) and by wholesalers of
metals, hardware, plumbing and heating equipment(up 6.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
Canadian wholesalers increased their inventories by 0.8 percent
in July to 33.9 billion dollars (24.4 billion USD), adding to the
1.3 percent increase in June.
</P>
<P>
Since August 1996, wholesalers have been increasing inventories
to meet higher demand.
</P>
<P>
Despite the July increase, the inventories-to-sales ratio
dropped for a second time this year to the historic low of 1.40,
compared with 1.42 in June.
</P>
<P>
To remain competitive, wholesalers prefer to keep the ratio as
low as possible in order to reduce their storage expenses.

AMMAN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul-Salam Majali and Foreign Minister Fayez Tarawneh today
pledged to help the European Union (EU) activate its role in the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Radio Jordan reported that the two Jordanian officials made the
promise in separate meetings with visiting EU Mideast special
envoy Miguel Moratinos, who arrived here today for an official
visit to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos' talks with Majali and Tarawneh also focused on the

</P>
<P>
Moratinos said that the EU role in the region was

</P>
<P>
The EU envoy' visit to Jordan came three days after
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright concluded her first
trip to the region, which covered Israel, Palestinian self-rule
areas, Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Short of bringing the peace process back on track, Albright's
visit did result in an arrangement for Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority to resume high-level contact later this month
in Washington and New York.

<HEADLINE> Shake-up in D.C. Homicide Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Washington D.C. Police
Chief Larry D. Soulsby has announced a major shake-up in the
department's homicide unit, ousting 17 supervisory detectives
after independent experts found an array of management and
police-work failure.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week Soulsby ousted the homicide commander, citing
the unit's steadily declining success rate in solving cases.
</P>
<P>
"We felt compelled to make changes, and I do so with a heavy
heart," The Washington Post quoted Soulsby as saying in an
interview Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The decision to remove the supervisors resulted from a review
by a group of outside homicide-investigation experts, who examined
numerous case files chosen at random from the last five years and
discovered myriad flaws.
</P>
<P>
Three lieutenants and seven sergeants from the central homicide
office at police headquarters were reassigned to other units, as
were sergeants from each of the department's seven district
stations. They supervised about 100 homicide detectives.
</P>
<P>
"Now we're going to be looking at the quality of work of every
investigator," the chief said.
</P>
<P>
The department's homicide closure rate has been declining
steadily -- from 55 percent in 1994 to 43 in 1995, to 42 percent
last year. So far this year, the unit has made arrests in 34
percent of its homicide cases. Nationally, the homicide closure
rate for police departments is 65 percent, according to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

<HEADLINE> Kohl, Chirac Meet in Weimar in Franco-German Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WEIMAR, Germany, September 18 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and French President Jacques Chirac began the 70th
Franco-German summit this evening in the eastern German historic
city of Weimar.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, along with French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
and six government ministers from both sides each, will hold an
initial round of talks at a working dinner Thursday evening. The
primary talks will be held on Friday which will be followed with
a joint news conference.
</P>
<P>
Key issues on the agenda of the talks would be the future of
the planned single European currency -- the Euro, the eastward
expansion of the European Union (EU) and its internal reforms, as
well as the unemployment issue, German media said.
</P>
<P>
To order to quell widespread sceptism about the Euro, both
sides are expected to reaffirm their determination to hold on to
the stability criteria of the Euro and its punctual start on
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
They will also try to iron out their apparent differences over
the EU expansion and its reforms.
</P>
<P>
France, along with Italy and Belgium, suggested earlier this
week that the EU should now focus on further internal reforms
prior to taking in new members from eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on
Wednesday that the EU expansion should now take priority.
</P>
<P>
Both burdened with double-digit unemployment rates, Germany and
France will also discuss the preparation for a European Union's
special meeting on unemployment to be held in Luxembourg in
November.
</P>
<P>
Also on the agenda of the summit will be the reduction of
Germany's financial contribution to the EU, reform of EU
agricultural policy, and the restructuring of the Airbus
consortium.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two countries will also sign a series of
cultural agreement, including the creation of the planned
Franco-German University, which will serve as a coordinating forum

CAIRO, September (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Spain is to grant 1 million U.S. dollars to Jordan as
financial aid, a Spanish Embassy statement said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Spain's contribution came following an appeal by the kingdom
to the European Union (EU) to increase its financial aid to help
Jordan carry out its economic reform program, according to
semi-official Jordan Times today.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is expected to receive 75 to 80 million dollars of
financial aid from the EU this year, Jordanian Deputy Prime
Minister for Development and Prime Ministry Affairs Jawad Anani
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan and Saudi Arabia concluded a memorandum of
understanding here on Wednesday on bilateral cooperation in media
and information, semi-official Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, bilateral ties will be promoted in media
and information and agreements be concluded on cooperation
between the two countries' national news agencies, radio and
television stations, and press and publication departments.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum also calls for the exchange of radio and
television materials, expertise in information fields, and
personnel training.
</P>
<P>
It also allows for the exchange of documentaries and
publications, and consultation on legislation connected with press
and information.
</P>
<P>
TUNIS -- Algerian and Tunisian businessmen have concluded a
number of deals worth 107 million U.S. dollars, Tunisian newspaper
"Al-Sabah" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The deals, on machinery, phosphate, pulp plastic and rubber
sectors, were signed during the second meeting of businessmen of
the two countries which was wound up in the Tunisian capital of
Tunis Wednesday, an unnamed Algerian Industry Ministry source said
in an interview published by the newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
The source pointed out that businessmen of the two countries
also agreed to set up 10 joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of Tunisian and Algerian businessmen was held
last January in Algiers where a number of business deals valuing
some 145 million dollars were concluded.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- State-owned Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI)
company announced today its first profits after several years of
losses.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that the company earned 7 million
U.S. dollars in net income in the first six months of 1997, and
projected a profit of 20 million dollars for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, executives of the company said the firm lost 140
million U.S. dollars during the first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
"We knew we were going to make a profit for 1997, but we were
surprised by the figures," IAI president Moshe Keret said.
</P>
<P>
Keret attributed the improvement to better-than-expected sales
and a devaluation of the shekel, which also hiked earnings. He
said that this year's profitability is a trend for the IAI.
</P>
<P>
Keret noted that the company's recovery plan has eliminated
many of its problems, including staffing and inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the company has penetrated into new markets,
which brought about increased sales. During the first half of
1997, IAI signed contracts totalling 1.6 billion U.S. dollars,
more than double the 730 million dollars in contracts signed in
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
IAI's sales for the first half of 1997 were 771 million
dollars, as opposed to 692 million dollars in the same period last
year. Its backlog of orders now stands at a record 3.3 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Welcomes Clerides-Denktash Security Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today welcomed the
planned talks between Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash on security issues.
</P>
<P>
A written statement issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry
said that the security talks would contribute to the peace and
stability on the divided Cyrus island.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted that the planned talks would be limited to
discussing security measures along the U.N. patrolled buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
"The measures to increase security include some military
precautions to eliminate the danger of undesired incidents in
the buffer zone," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on security talks between leaders of the two
rival Cypriot communities was announced Monday by U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright during a stop-over in Cyprus after
her Middle East tour.
</P>
<P>
In a Wednesday speech to the press, Denktash stressed that the
wider issues of demilitarization and troop reduction would not be
discussed at the forthcoming negotiations.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides told a Cypriot daily in Nicosia earlier
today that the Cypriot government deemed Denktash's call for
security talks as "a positive proposal", adding this could avert
an explosion in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
A wave of violence on the divided eastern Mediterranean
island last year claimed six lives along the 180-kilometer-long
buffer zone, prompting both sides to reconsider
confidence-building measures.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided into the Greek and Turkish communities after
the Turkish troops took over the northern third of the island in
the weak of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" which is recognized only
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the possible delivery of the S-300 missiles to the
Greek Cypriots in accordance with a Cypriot-Russian arms deal
touched a new wave of tension in the small island state.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hails Adoption of Convention Banning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 18 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today warmly welcomed the adoption of the Convention on
the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer
of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
"By this act, a standard has been set for moving towards the
elimination of the invisible enemy, which kills innocent civilians
every day and rob people of their means of livelihood," the U.N.
chief said in a statement issued through his spokesman Fred
Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
Annan said :"The sense of mission and determination that were
shown in negotiating this treaty must be sustained. Governments
will have to allocate resources to implement its provisions, and
everyone, in various forum, will have to work strenuously to
promote its universalization."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief stressed although a sound base for the struggle
for the eradication of landmines had been laid, the work of
removing millions of mines already in the ground and of assisting
the victims of mimes was ongoing. Each state party to this
Convention in a position to do so must do its part.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General hoped very much that those not in a
position to support the Convention now would be able to do so in
the near future and work in the Conference on Disarmament would
contribute to universal adherence to a total ban.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to fulfill the functions entrusted to him and to
the United Nations Secretariat under this new Convention.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 10 in Cairo Bus Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in a fatal
terror attack in downtown Cairo today has risen to 10 as one of
the nine wounded died in hospital.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian Interior Ministry official, quoted by the Egyptian
MENA news agency, said the fatalities, four men and six women,
have been carried to a morgue here and will be identified soon.
</P>
<P>
Nine German tourists were killed on the spot and another nine
injured as their bus parked in front of the Egyptian Antiquities
Museum was bombed at 12:15 local time (9:15 GMT) today.
</P>
<P>
The attack against tourists has been condemned by U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Anna, U.S. President Bill Clinton, German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel and British Foreign Minister Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said he has instructed the German Embassy in Cairo and
his ministry's staff to do their best to help the wounded and and
to bring back home the bodies of the dead.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman of Germany declined to comment on
any likely measures Bonn would take in the wake of today's
tragedy. Germany is the number one source of tourists for Egypt,
with some 460,000 people coming to visit annually.
</P>
<P>
But an Italian tourist official said today's blast will not
daunt foreign tourist away from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Luigi Cociarelli, deputy secretary general of the Italian
Tourism Chamber, said Egypt's name will not consequently be put on
the list of "dangerous countries," citing Egypt's vast tourist
resources and the confidence of Italians in the ability of the
Egyptian security to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Two of the assailants, identified as Saber Mahmoud Farahat Abul
Ela and his brother Mahmoud were wounded in an exchange of fire
with the police and then arrested, while a third fled.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry has yet to track down the fugitive and
find if there were other cohorts, but it announced that Saber is
legally insane.
</P>
<P>
"Preliminary investigations proved that one of them is mentally
disturbed who escaped from a mental hospital three days ago," the
ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Saber was sent to hospital for treatment of his mental
disturbance after he fired at a guest with a revolver in the lobby
of the Semiramis Intercontinental hotel in Cairo on October 26,
1993, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Cairo Governor Abdel Rahian Shehata told reporters that the
three attackers opened fire and threw home-made bombs into the
tourist bus in front of the Egyptian Antiquities Museum, which
holds the world's most precious archeological discoveries.
</P>
<P>
Investigations showed that the incendiary charge was a
family-sized soft drink bottle filled with petrol and kerosene.
</P>
<P>
At least 33 tourists were in the bus as the bomb went off,
according to Mamdouh Al-Gohari, director of Spring Tours Company,
owner of the bus. The white bus was scorched black from inside and
its glass windows were all shattered.
</P>
<P>
The police said that they saw one of the gunmen placed a bag
under the bus while another threw a Molotov cocktail at it as the
group of tourists were leaving the bus to visit the museum.
</P>
<P>
Six of the injured, aged from 27 to 45, underwent urgent
operations immediately after their arrival at the nearby Kasr
al-Eini Hospital while others suffering deep wounds and fractures
were treated.
</P>
<P>
The attack seemed so timed and planned as to create utmost
upheaval in Cairo's most crowded commercial and business center.
</P>
<P>
The attack shocked foreign tourists in the vicinity, some
sobbed. They were ushered away from the museum, a usually
heavily-guarded treasure trove of Pharaonic relics.
</P>
<P>
An Australian, identified herself only as Laura, told Xinhua
that the police and the attackers exchanged fire. "Just minutes,
explosions, fire, bullets, and hell... I was waiting at the gate
for others to come out (of the museum)."
</P>
<P>
The police, equipped with anti-riot gears and automatic rifles,
cordoned off the roads leading to the scene, the city's central
transit point, paralyzing traffic for hours.
</P>
<P>
The area was being combed in search of any of their accomplices
and to secure it from any further possible bomb threats, according
to the police.
</P>
<P>
A police officer, on condition of anonymity, said that the
attackers were wearing business suits in an apparent attempt to
avoid attention in the super-crowded city center that hosts a
number of government offices and plush hotels.
</P>
<P>
The attack was probably in response to the country's single
largest trial three days ago when 69 Muslim militants were
sentenced to death or years in prison. They were convicted of
staging major terrorist attacks to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
In a five-year campaign launched by Muslim militants against
the secular government, nearly 1,200 people have been killed,
including tourists, police officers and civilians. Most of the
attacks took place in Upper Egypt, hideouts for most militants.
</P>
<P>
In the latest attack against foreigners, Muslim militants
opened fire at a group of Greek tourists in Cairo's Europa Hotel
in April 1996, killing 18 and injuring 16.

<HEADLINE> US Welcomes Settlers Leaving Arab Properties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
today that it was "good news" for Jewish settlers to move out of
two properties in Arab East Jerusalem they had taken over.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright "regards it as good news that the families are
moving out" and Washington "hoped and expected" that the previous
status quo at the location would not change.
</P>
<P>
The settlers moved into the two properties in the Ras Al-Amoud
district Sunday night. Albright, on her way back home from the
Middle East, called the takeover "not helpful."
</P>
<P>
The moving out of the Jewish settlers took place after the
Israeli government and U.S. Jewish millionaire Irving Moskowitz,
who bankrolled the takeover, reached agreement earlier today for
that matter. But still 10 Jewish students were allowed to live in
the houses, which drew immediate condemnation from Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, who denounced the deal as a "trick."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Israel had told the United States that the three
families who were occupying the houses "will leave no later than
tomorrow. They will not be replaced by other families."
</P>
<P>
"There will be no new construction at this site and no movement
to create a new neighborhood.... We hope and expect that the
status quo will not change," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"Any future developments which might alter the status quo at
the site would only re-create the lightning rod for increased
tensions which we criticized yesterday," he added.

<HEADLINE> Cameroun Reforms Recruitment for Teachers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Cameroun's Minister of
National Education Mbella Mbape has revealed that graduates from
teachers' training colleges would soon be recruited to serve in
specific schools, according to Cameroun Tribune today.
</P>
<P>
Opening the workshop organized for provincial and divisional
authorities of the ministry Tuesday, the minister said graduates
from teachers' training colleges would no longer be directly
recruited into the public service as in the past.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, recruitment would be based on the job
opportunities that are available.
</P>
<P>
Upon graduation, the minister said, primary school teachers
will be obliged to apply for recruitment to specific areas where
job offers would be made by the provincial or divisional
education officials as the need arises.
</P>
<P>
This may eventually bring a lasting solution to the over-staff
and under-staff problems in schools in urban and rural areas
respectively.
</P>
<P>
It may also lead to drastic reduction of state expenditure on
transfers and general movement of teachers, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It added that the reform which starts with primary schools is
expected to spread to secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,600 primary school teachers were trained last year,
whereas some 3,200 teachers are in need this year. It is
expected that the demand for 12,000 would be exhausted in three
years to meet the need of about 2 million school pupils.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of teachers was caused by the closure of
teachers' training colleges in 1991, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> US Business Group Stresses New US Role in Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The New York-based
Committee for Economic Development (CED) today outlined a new
strategy for resolving U.S.-Asia trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
The CED report, U.S. Economic Policy Toward the Asia-Pacific
Region, was produced by a task force of business and education
leaders led by Boyd E. Givan, senior vice president and chief
financial officer of the Boeing Company, and Clifton R. Wharton,
Jr., former deputy secretary of state and former chairman and CEO
of TIAA-CREF, the world's largest private pension fund, as well as
others.
</P>
<P>
This nonpartisan group of national business leaders urged the
U.S. government to "back away from unilateral sanctions and
bilateral trade battles, which include disputes with Japan and
China."
</P>
<P>
Instead, the CED called on the government to settle disputes
where possible through the World Trade Organization (WTO), which
is proving fair and effective in resolving conflicts and opening
markets.
</P>
<P>
The report also urged the U.S. government to support China's
bid to join the WTO, and endorse international efforts to smooth
volatility in Asian financial markets.
</P>
<P>
CED also warned against letting misplaced concern over U.S.
trade deficits with individual countries derail efforts to broaden
trade and investment with Asia.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed "China belongs in the WTO" and the United
States should not make Chinese WTO membership conditional on such
nontrade considerations as Hong Kong, human rights, or arms sales.
</P>
<P>
The Committee for Economic Development is an independent
research and policy organization of some 250 business leaders and
educators. It is a nonprofit, nonpartisan and non-political
organization.

<HEADLINE> Solana Hints at NATO Role in Bosnia Beyond June 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General Javier
Solana of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) today
hinted a possible continuing NATO presence in Bosnia beyond June
1998 when the current peacekeeping mission ends.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters here, Solana said, "The international
community should not abandon Bosnia."
</P>
<P>
"SFOR (the Stabilization Force) as such will not be continued,
as such" beyond next summer, Solana said, putting emphasis on the
term "as such" to suggest that a NATO force may continue to stay
under some other name in the region.
</P>
<P>
In July, U.S. President Bill Clinton also suggested that there
should be some kind of international presence in Bosnia and did
not rule out the possibility of a continued U.S. role in some
aspect of supporting Bosnia's fragile peace.
</P>
<P>
The alliance-led multinational forces entered Bosnia after the
Dayton Peace Agreement was signed in 1995 under the name of the
Implementation Force, which changed into the Stabilization Force
last December.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who was holding meetings today with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and Defense Secretary William Cohen, said it
was too early to begin debating NATO's role in Bosnia beyond June.
</P>
<P>
"We have to see how things evolve, and we have to decide what
we will do after" June, Solana said.
</P>
<P>
"But at this moment, we should not distract ourselves from the
main aim that we have, which is to use properly the time that is
left until July 1998 with SFOR on the ground," he added.

<HEADLINE> US Air Force Celebrates 50th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force today
celebrated its 50th anniversary with President Bill Clinton paying
a visit to the Pentagon to honor the service.
</P>
<P>
Cutting the cake and applauding the Air Force, Clinton thanked
the pilots, flight and ground crews and others in a keynote speech
in which he called the U.S. Air Force the best one in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Department of the Air Force was established when President
Harry Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947 and the Army
Air Corps became the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he appreciates the Air Force's work in flying and
maintaining Air Force One, and told the assembled airmen, "We can
always count on you to aim high and reach for new horizons."
</P>
<P>
President Clinton made the hastily scheduled appearance at the
ceremony, which was in the heels of a series of military air
crashes. Clinton sought to bolster morale, telling airmen and
women, "You've made us more secure, you've made the world a safer
place."
</P>
<P>
The ceremony comes as the service has struggled through a rough
year.
</P>
<P>
In June, Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston withdrew his name from
consideration to become the next Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman
after admitting to having an adulterous affair more than a decade
earlier.
</P>
<P>
In July, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Ron Fogelman resigned a
year early to protest the Pentagon's decision to blame another
general for the 1996 terrorist attack that killed 19 airmen at
Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Air Force admitted it was losing more pilots
than it can afford, and it would pay big bonuses in an effort to
stop the defections.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Defense Secretary William Cohen ordered the Air
Force and its sister services to halt training flights for a
one-day period over the coming week, beginning early Friday after
five crashes in four days.
</P>
<P>
The crashes included the high-profile downing of a Stealth jet
Sunday and an apparent collision between a transport plane and a
German military aircraft a day earlier.

<HEADLINE> Salaries in Canada Up 3.2 Percent: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Salaries in Canada increased
by an average of 3.2 percent this year, compared with 2.9 percent
last year, according to a survey released today by Canada's
largest professional services firm KPMG.
</P>
<P>
"But it is in the executive suite that we've noticed the
largest increases in pay -- an average of 3.6 percent, up from 3.4
percent in the previous year," the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The annual survey is the only one in Canada to provide a
complete detailed breakdown for all jobs across the country, KPMG
said.
</P>
<P>
By industry, the survey found that the high-tech sector is
showing the largest salary increases.
</P>
<P>
This year's average salary increases in the communication,
electronics and software industries were 4.2 percent over those of
last year.
</P>
<P>
In other high-tech sectors such as biomedical and
pharmaceuticals, the salary increases were 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
While the private sector received average gains of 3.2 percent,

<HEADLINE> Israelis Reach Internal Agreement on Ras Al-Amud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government and
U.S. businessman Irving Moscowitz reached an agreement here this
evening over the issue of Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem's
Ras Al-Amud.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the three Jewish families moved into Ras
Al-Amud on Sunday would have to leave later tonight and 10 Israeli
policemen would stay there to guard the two houses brought by
Moscowitz.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. businessman brought the houses in the Arab
neighborhood in an attempt to build 70 housing units for Jewish
settlers. However, the advent of the three Jewish families enraged
Palestinians and Israeli peace activists.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrations have been held to demand the evacuation of the
Jewish settlers. Palestinian youths clashed with Israeli police,
which threatened to trigger another round of violence.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis' internal agreement softened the stance of the
Jewish settlers, but it fell short of meeting Palestinian demands.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat said
this evening in Gaza that this agreement is a trick and PNA will
not accept it.
</P>
<P>
Israeli has been urged by the U.S. to have a "time-out" in
provocative Jewish settlement expansion in traditionally Arab
East Jerusalem in order to give peace a chance. However, the
Netanyahu government flatly rejected this appeal.

<HEADLINE> Clear Water, Blue Skies Within China's Reach: WB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Despite the magnitude of
China's pollution problems, the country has an unprecedented
opportunity to better its quality of environment, according to a
new World Bank report, "Clear Water, Blue Skies," released today.
</P>
<P>
The effects of excessive pollution -- in the form of premature
deaths, sickness, and damage to productive resources -- are
estimated to cost China 54 billion U.S. dollars a year, or eight
percent of its gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Yet, the same rapid economic growth that has added to China's
environmental woes in the past can be harnessed to ensure a
cleaner future.
</P>
<P>
The report, produced in close collaboration with China's
National Environmental Protection Agency and State Planning
Commission, focuses on two of China's most pressing environmental
concerns: air and water pollution and their relation to economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, China can turn its assets --
increasing market orientation, rapid economic growth, and strong
administrative capacity -- into advantages for preserving and
improving its environment for future generations. This requires
pursuing a new pattern of growth -- one that can both increase
incomes and improve environmental quality.
</P>
<P>
To achieve these outcomes, the report recommends that China
should harness the market to work for the environment, not against
it. This will require adjusting prices to cover economic costs and
incorporating social costs through pollution taxes.
</P>
<P>
China should also create incentives to elicit investments --
from both the commercial state and non-state sectors and from the
public sector -- with the largest environmental benefits for future
generations.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the government should provide better regulations
but with fewer investment controls at the national level, as well
as ensuring better planning and pollution enforcement in urban
airspeeds and regional water basins.
</P>
<P>
A strategy that channels investment into cleaner production,
encourages material and energy efficiency, and encourages the
conservation of scare resources could reduce emissions in 2020
below today's levels, improve air and water quality, and lower
pollution-related health costs by 75 percent, the report says.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Finance Minister Liu
Zhongli said here today that he has confidence in Asia's
economies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the First Asia-Europe Finance Ministers Meeting,
Liu said that since July this year, there has been financial
turbulence in some Asian countries, which has had a negative
impact on economic growth. However, he said, he is still confident
of these economies, including that of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In the short term, he said, these economies will still have
favorable conditions for an appropriate growth and will remain a
strong force in maintaining the world's economic growth and
stability.
</P>
<P>
He said economic slowdown in some Asian countries is inevitable
and is a process these economies must undergo in order to achieve
the goal of sound and sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the economic slowdown and financial turbulence
 can be solved through adjustments and reform.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that these countries still enjoy good prospects
because they still have advantages in maintaining high degrees of
savings, high investment rate and moderate financial policies.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Subsidizes Poverty-Stricken Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Students attending 12 local
universities in Gansu Province in northwest China today became the
first to receive provincial government subsidies for
poverty-stricken students.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government plans to allocate 15 million yuan in
the Gansu Province Fund for Poverty-Stricken Students by the end
of this century, and all interest generated by the funds will be
used to support poor students.
</P>
<P>
Gansu, one of the nation's most underdeveloped provinces, has
60 counties which rely on government subsidies and are home to
over 3.5 million local people without access to adequate food and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
Students from poverty-stricken families, which account for some
20 percent of the total number of university students in the
province, have in recent years faced the likelihood of abandoning
their educations due to rising costs.
</P>
<P>
Increasing tuition fees still fall far short of covering costs,
according to Yan Sisheng, director of the Provincial Education
Commission. He noted that tuition fees account for only 20-25
percent of total costs, with the government shouldering the burden
for remaining costs.
</P>
<P>
Some 20-30 percent of school fees are reimbursed to students in
the form of fellowships or student loans, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
Yan said the central government has invested nearly 500 million
yuan to help students studying in universities under direct
ministry administration since 1994, while locally administered
universities have received six million yuan for student assistance.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Zhao Jianxiong, vice-president of Lanzhou Medical
Institute, said: "The target of our school is to prevent any
student from dropping out simply because of financial
difficulties."

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 ethnic Naga
villagers, including women and children, were killed and more than
20 houses were burnt today by suspected ethnic Kuki militants at a
village in the northeastern Indian state of Manipur.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India quoted official sources as saying that
about 90 Kuki activists, equipped with sophisticated weapons,
swooped down on Thedram Nava Village early this morning.
</P>
<P>
The activists opened fire, killing 10 people and setting at
least 20 houses on fire.
</P>
<P>
The attackers then fled into the nearby jungles, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
They added that police and security forces have rushed to the
area but no arrests have been made so far.
</P>
<P>
The incident, a major one in the past few months, appears to be
in retaliation to the September 16 killing of two Kuki villagers
by armed Naga activists, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The largest number of casualties in Naga-Kuki ethnic clashes
was reported on September 13, 1993, when 104 Kuki villagers were
killed.

PARIS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Trevor Rees-Jones, the bodyguard
of Diana, the late Princess of Wales, cannot remember what was going
on when the Mercedes crashed into a pillar in a Paris underpass
which resulted in the death of Diana and two others.
</P>
<P>
Investigating judge Herve Staphan today had the first,
half-an-hour interview with Rees-Jones at the Pitie-Salpetriere
Hospital here, but could not get any useful precisions about what
happened in the mid-night of August 30 and the early morning of
August 31.
</P>
<P>
Officials close to the investigation said that Rees-Jones could
be struck with a partial amnesia.
</P>
<P>
The judge is expecting to have another interview with him on an
unspecified date, said officials.
</P>
<P>
The British embassy said that the interview took place in a
chamber of the emergency rescue department of the hospital in the
presence of an officer from the Criminal Brigade of French Police as
well as the family members of Rees-Jones.
</P>
<P>
The investigators expected a testimony by the 29-year-old former
Gulf War parachutist to shed light on two key questions: How was
Henri Paul, the chauffeur of the Mercedes S-280 sedan who was proved
to be drunk that night, controlling the speed of the car? Was there
another car on the path of the Mercedes in the Alma tunnel when the
accident took place?
</P>
<P>
Doctors said that Rees-Jones, who was suffering from severe
facial injury, pulmonary contusion and mild brain contusion, has
been recovering these days after having had an operation on his
facial injury early this month.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Leader Rejects Agreement on Ras Al-Amud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat said here today that he will not
accept a multi-party agreement over the controversial issue of
Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem's Ras Al-Amud.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, upon arrival here on a two-day visit, said the
agreement, involving the Israeli government, Jewish settlers and
U.S. businessman Irving Moscowitz, is "just an attempt by the
Israeli government to consolidate settlement activities in
defiance of all agreements."
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached Thursday, the three Jewish families
which moved into two houses in Ras Al-Amud Sunday must leave
immediately and 10 Israeli policemen would stay there to guard the
houses bought by Moscowitz.
</P>
<P>
"The settlers must be evicted completely," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. businessman has planned build 70 housing units for
Jewish settlers in the area. However, the advent of the three
Jewish families enraged Palestinians and Israeli peace activists.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he will brief the Arab foreign ministers on the
Israeli provocations against the Palestinians at the opening
session of the Arab League Council of Foreign Ministers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was supposed to fly here directly from Gaza as per an
agreement reached with Israel in March, but the Israeli
authorities Thursday denied him permission to use the Gaza
airport. He was driven in car to the Egyptian city of Al-Arish
before flying here.
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister of Local Administration Saeb Erekat and
Coordinator of Negotiation Affairs Hassan Asfour are also here for
discussions with Egyptian officials on the scheduled talks between
the Palestinians, Israelis and U.S. this month sponsored by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright during her recent
Mideast tour.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have been deadlocked since
March when Israel began building Jewish settlements in East
Jerusalem. And the five-month crisis heightened after five suicide
bombings hit Jerusalem on July 30 and September 4 that killed 25
people and wounded more than 300 others.

<P>
The issues concerning the banner and the core of leadership are
essential to the future and destiny of the Party and state. Party
history has taught us that every success in revolution and
economic construction is indispensable from a correct theory and
line, and a firm core of leadership of the Party Central Committee
that adheres to the correct theory and line.
</P>
<P>
Since the Fourth Plenum of the 13th National Party Congress,
the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core,
under the complicated domestic and international situation, has
resolutely implemented the Party's basic theory and line, leading
the whole Party and all Chinese people to march forward
unswervingly along the road of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Since the 14th National Party Congress in 1992, China's
reforms, opening-up and modernization drive has entered a new
phase of greater prosperity and more rapid development, scoring
tremendous achievements that have attracted worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
The unusual practice over the past eight years has proved the
maturity and firmness of the collective leadership of the Party
Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, which is not only
competent and industrious, but also pragmatic and eager to seek
truth from facts.
</P>
<P>
The past experience has also proved that the Party's collective
leadership, which is very good at applying Marx-Leninism, Mao
Zedong thought and in particular Deng Xiaoping Theory to solve
major problems in China's economic, political, cultural, national
defense and foreign affairs fields, is absolutely capable of
exercising an effective control over the overall situation and
pushing forward triumphantly thee country's socialist
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
With the great, glorious and victorious banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory and under the cross-century firm collective leadership of
the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, our
Party will surely become invincible and achieve every success in
its cause.

<P>
Democratic centralism is the fundamental organizational and
leadership system of our Party. It is also an important principle
that individual Party member should be subordinated to the
organization of the Party, the minority to the majority, the lower
level organization to the higher one, and all Party organizations
and members to the National Congress and the Central Committee of
the Party.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping pointed out, "Any collective leadership must have
a core, and it will be unreliable if it has no core."
</P>
<P>
Party organizations at different levels and all Party members
must unite closely around the Party Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at the core, safeguard its authority, keep in agreement with
the Central Committee ideologically and politically, and ensure
the smooth implementation of the Party's line and policy decisions
of the Party Central Committee. This fully reflects the strength
of the Party, the overall situation of the socialist modernization
drive and the basic interests of the people of China's all
nationalities.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Launches Action Plan to Fight Haze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government
launched today an action plan to deal with the haze problem, which
took a turn for the worse last night when the Pollutant Standards
Index (PSI) reading hit 226, the worst level ever.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Ministry said when releasing the action plan
that it breaks the haze index into six levels and indicates
appropriate responses for each level. The levels are in reference
to a PSI reading taken over a 24-hour period.
</P>
<P>
According to the action plan, if the haze reaches up to the 200
PSI level, the Environment Ministry will update the public on the
haze situation and provide a health advisory.
</P>
<P>
Between the 201 and 300 PSI level, fuel burning industry and
vehicle owners will be asked to cut down on emissions.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Ministry said major oil refining and power
generating companies have been contacted and their responses were
positive.
</P>
<P>
Further down the scale, if the reading breaches the 300 mark,
schools and sports complexes will be closed. And, if it goes above
the 400 level, civil defense sirens will be sounded and
Singaporeans will have to tune in to radio for announcements on
air quality and health advisory.
</P>
<P>
At that level, the ministry said, everyone should remain
indoors, keeping windows and doors closed.

<HEADLINE> Experts Optimistic over Asia's Long-Term Growth Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Financial experts voiced
optimism here today over Asia's long-term growth prospects in
spite of the current Southeast Asian currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
A host of fundamentals in the regional economy remain good,
justifying the confidence in the region's strong performance well
into the next century, they told a one-day seminar organized by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
"The crisis has its origins in mismanagement of short-term
economic policy, and has little to do with long-term structural
factors with inexorable implications for the sustainability of
growth over long periods," said Professor of Economics Ross
Garnaut from the Australian National University.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nordin Sopiee, chairman of the Institute of Strategic
Studies of Malaysia, described the crisis as a timely wake-up
call.
</P>
<P>
Asia has enjoyed the highest and longest growth the world has
seen, he said, stressing that the current crisis, breaking out in
Thailand and spilling over to the Philippines, Malaysia and
Indonesia, can be turned into an opportunity if a lesson is drawn
from it.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Young-Ki Lee, vice-president of the Korea Development
Institute, predicted that growth will decelerate as Asian
economies mature, but in about a decade the region's growth
momentum will be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Looking at the challenges for a sustained growth in Asia, Peter
Sutherland, former director-general of the World Trade
Organization, said that for the immediate future, Asian economies
will have to adjust to the aftermath of recent currency
volatility, learning to live in an environment of flexible
exchange rates, as well as coping with the current export
slowdown.
</P>
<P>
In the longer run, issues to be faced include the response to
globalization and other changes to the external economic
environment, the need for sound domestic economic management, the
further development of domestic capital markets, and investment in
human capital through education and training, Sutherland said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Teh Kok Peng, deputy managing director of the Monetary
Authority of Singapore, also described infrastructure and human
capital development as critical to Asia's sustained growth.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine May Pay Off Wage Debts This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine should be able to pay
off all of its wage arrears before the end of 1997, a Ukrainian
press report quoted President Leonid Kuchma as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The statement, made at a meeting of the presidential Supreme
Economic Council, was backed by Kuchma's announcement that the
government's wage arrears were down by 22 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
The encouraging development, the president told the group of
his advisors, gave every reason to believe that the rest of the
state's debt to workers could be cleared in next several months.
</P>
<P>
As shown by official data, the wage arrears were 4.5 billion
hryvnas (2.4 billion dollars) at the end of July, and the pension
arrears are currently 3.7 billion hryvnas (1.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
An advocate for the unconditional and full repayment of debts
to all budgets, Kuchma said the pension arrears had been down by
217 million hryvnas (119 million dollars) in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
"The government, starting with the prime minister and ending
with the heads of local administrations should see the repayment
of debts as a sacred duty," the Ukrainian President urged.
</P>
<P>
However, wage debts in the private sector had grown unchecked
by 2.5 percent over the last month, he added, noting that "the
state does not have enough leverage to influence the situation."

<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Li Lanqing, a noted foreign
trade expert, today was promoted from a member of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China

1952 and joined the CPC in the same year.
</P>
<P>
During 1956-57, he worked as a trainee at Moscow's Liharchev

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Official Denies Bus Blast as Terrorist Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Information Minister
Safwat el-Sherif today denied the bus explosion in downtown Cairo
Thursday as a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
"It should not be categorized under terrorism as some media
sources and foreign news agencies have been doing," he said in an
interview with the TV program Good Morning Egypt.
</P>
<P>
His remark was an apparent effort to play down public fears
over the bomb attack that killed nine tourists, a driver and
wounded 24 others.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has succeeded in checking the wave of violence and
chasing the remnants of terrorist elements, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, just before his statement was broadcast, another
suspected militant attack hit Upper Egypt at 7 a.m. local time
today. One policeman was killed and another injured as
unidentified gunmen opened fire at a police vehicle in Assuit,
about 320 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,200 people have been killed, including tourists,
police officers and civilians, since five years ago when the
Muslim militants started fighting against the secular government.
</P>
<P>
There is no immediate claim of responsibility, but the police
have linked it to Muslim extremists intent to blow up tourism, one
of Egypt's top hard currency earners.
</P>
<P>
The previous and severe attack against foreigners took place in
April, 1996 as extremists opened fire at a group of Greek tourists
in Cairo's Europa Hotel, killing 18 and injuring 16 others.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, the Egyptian Human Rights
Organization condemned Thursday's attack as a "dangerous violation
of the right to live and a momentous encroachment on the tourist
sector in an attempt to undermine the national economy."
</P>
<P>
However, there has been a speculation that the attack is a
response to Egypt's massive trial of Muslim militants four days
ago. A tribunal sentenced four militants to death and 69 others to
different terms of imprisonment.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu
Rongji expressed appreciation here today for New Zealand
government's efforts to promote relations with China and noted
that related efforts have heralded broad prospects for mutually
beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed to the fact that bilateral ties have developed
smoothly over the past 25 years since the establishment of
diplomatic relations. The Chinese vice-premier made the remarks
during a meeting with Winston Peters, deputy prime minister and
treasurer of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that exchange of visits and contacts between leaders
of the two nations have played a positive role in advancing
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, bilateral economic and trade links have
witnessed noticeable progress in recent years, with witnessing an
expanding trade volume and increasing mutual investments. He noted
that New Zealand is one of China's major worldwide investment
targets.
</P>
<P>
Zhu stressed that new progress has been recorded in bilateral
ties this year, and cited the fact that a delegation led by Peters
attended the July Hong Kong's hand-over ceremony, including the
swearing-in ceremony of the Provisional Legislative Council. He
also pointed out that New Zealand took the lead in reaching an
agreement with China on the issue of mutual market access
concerning the latter's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Peters said that the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong is
not only in the best interests of China, but also benefits the
economic development of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
He said the coalition government of New Zealand will continue
to give priority to the Asia-Pacific Region while conducting
foreign relations, and the his country places great emphasis on
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
According to Peters, China is New Zealand's 8th largest export
market and the nation's largest wool market.

of Zhu, also met with Chen Jinhua, Chinese minister in charge of

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Seminar Discusses IMF Role, Asian Economic Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Despite the recent turmoil
in the Southeast Asian financial markets, the financial
fundamentals in the region remain intact and in time the
difficulties will be overcome -- this is the common view of
participants in a large-sized seminar held here today.
</P>
<P>
Some 400 financiers, economists and government officials from
all over the world attended the whole-day seminar entitled "Asia
and the IMF", which was organized by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The seminar included four sessions focusing on the IMF's
macroeconomic policies and changing emphasis of the Fund, and
Asian economic development and challenges for sustaining growth in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Delivering an opening speech at the seminar, Chen Yuan, deputy
governor of the People's Bank of China, said that Asia has become
the most dynamic regional economy in the world with a good record
of growth performance.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 8.2 percent output growth rate of Asia
(excluding Japan and the Middle East) in 1996 was more than double
the global rate.
</P>
<P>
"However, Asia has encountered its own difficulties in economic
development. The recent turbulence in the currency market in the
Southeast Asia is one example," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the recent events to be temporary in nature. The
Asian economy remains healthy on the whole and its prospects are
favorable," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the prosperity and stability of the Chinese
mainland has a significant bearing on Hong Kong and on Asia in
general.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, Hong Kong will become even more prosperous.
A more modernized China will be better able to contribute to the
prosperity of the Asian region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Professor Ross Garnaut from Australian National University said
that the recent financial crisis in Southeast Asia has its origins
in mismanagement of short-term economic policy, and has little to
do with long-term structural factors. The instability can be
explained without reference to any inherent failure in long-term
growth capacity.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Seminar Discusses IMF Role, Asian Economic Development (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dr. Nordin Sopiee from Malaysia stressed that people should not
make an overall generalization about Southeast Asian
economies. Countries in this region have been pursuing different
development ways, there is no single model, no unique method, and
the fast development over the past years should not be simply
explained as a "miracle".
</P>
<P>
He said he was optimistic about the ability of relevant
countries to overcome the present difficulties and make further
achievements.
</P>
<P>
P.R. Narvekar, former deputy managing director of the IMF, said
that countries involved in the recent financial turmoil should not
be disappointed, instead, they should learn from it and reinforce
cooperation in this respect to study issues concerning financial
systems.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed the development speed of the Asian economy
over the past years will continue.
</P>
<P>
The role of the IMF was another topic of today's seminar.
Michael Mussa, director of the IMF Research Department, centered
his topic on the organization's approach to macroeconomic policy.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the IMF's recent economic rescue package of 17.2
billion U.S. dollars to help Thailand out of the currency
turbulence, Mussa said: "The IMF is not a passive adviser, but an
intellectual player (in the financial crisis)."
</P>
<P>
Today, surveillance and design of policies are the two major
roles of the IMF, founded in 1945 as one of the Bretton Woods
institutions, according to Mussa.
</P>
<P>
In a following session at the seminar, Jack Boorman, director
of the IMF's Policy Development and Review Department, explored
the change of focus the IMF should have in responding to global
economic change.
</P>
<P>
Boorman analyzed: "Market does not operate in a vacuum, and
there is a role for the government, such as setting up legal and
supervisory framework and providing basic infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the IMF should deepen its efforts in four
directions -- to enhance surveillance activities, strengthen
operation of markets, provide technical assistance, and mitigate
the risk of marginalization of its poor members.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Fischer, IMF first deputy managing director, said the
IMF is seeking an amendment to its charter, allowing it to promote
the orderly liberalization of global capital movements.
</P>
<P>
"It is likely that the Fund will develop the analogies for the
capital account of the present Articles 8 and 14 that apply to the
current account," he said, adding that liberalization of the
capital account can bring major benefits to the countries whose
residents and governments are able to borrow and lend on more
favorable terms in more sophisticated markets.

<HEADLINE> Migrant Farmers Emerging in South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 19 (Xinhua) -- When labor market
competition grows tense in urban areas of south China's Guangdong
Province, incoming migrant workers turn to agriculture and become
farmers all over again.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 migrant laborers are hired in the province's
rural areas, and are widely praised as being cost-effective, hard
working and easy to manage.
</P>
<P>
They choose to return to the fields partly because the
high-efficient agriculture in the Pearl River Delta area offers
jobs with salaries almost as high as those in factories or on
construction sites.
</P>
<P>
In Zhongshan City, 20,300 migrant laborers are working for
local farmers, accounting for nearly 10 percent of the city's
rural labor force. Workers at Fulian Farm are all migrant laborers
from southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Some have even become independent growers. In the city's
Minzhong Township, a 400-ha eel raising base is run by farmers
from a village in east China's Jiangsu Province. It is said that
more than 900 of the farmers in the village have come to Guangdong
to do farming work.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local farmers have little time to take care of
their farmland when they have opened business or become workers.
</P>
<P>
In Jilong and Huangbu townships of Huidong County, known as
shoe-making centers, most families are involved in shoe production
and need to hire migrant laborers to do their farming.

<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Doctors in Harbin, capital of
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, have reported the first
surgery patient in the city to receive a transfusion of his own
blood in an operation.
</P>
<P>
At the request of the patient, a middle school teacher, doctors
at Harbin's No. 2 Hospital set up a blood bank of the man's own
blood to be used during a lumbar vertebra operation, according to
Shanghai-based Xinmin Evening News.
</P>
<P>
Two months before the surgery, the doctors extracted 400 cc of
blood from the man, than transfused 200 cc back to him three days
later.
</P>
<P>
After another three days, the doctors again took out 400 cc of
blood, giving them a 600-cc supply. They said the operation was
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Doctors warn that tainted blood used in transfusions has become
a potential channel for contagious diseases such as hepatitis and
AIDS.

<HEADLINE> Pak PM to Leave for New York on Commercial Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 19 (Xinhua) -- As part of his austerity
drive, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will leave for New
York tomorrow by a scheduled flight of Pakistan International
Airline (PIA) to attend the 52nd session of the U.N. General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Sharif has turned down the request for a chartered plane as it
costs an extra 90,000 rupees (2,250 U.S. dollars) per ticket,
officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
"It is unprecedented in national history that a head of state
or government has opted for normal commercial flight for an
official visit to save the national exchequer," said the
officials.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the 18-member official entourage
has been instructed on behalf of the prime minister explicitly
that nothing would be paid out of official kitty except for their
hotel rent and normal meals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PIA has been asked in advance that persons
already booked on the New York-bound flight must not be disturbed
to accommodate the prime minister's entourage, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in New York, Sharif will address the U.N.
General Assembly session and meet U.S. President Bill Clinton,
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and other leaders attending the
session.
</P>
<P>
Sharif is also scheduled to have a meeting with his Indian
counterpart, Inder Kumar Gujral, on September 23.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers will discuss in detail all outstanding
issues between Pakistan and India with special reference to the
outcome of the Pakistan-India foreign secretary-level talks, which
concluded in New Delhi on Thursday, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported here today that the talks ended
without any progress in making operational the working groups
identified by the two sides at their previous meeting in Islamabad
in June.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province, an
agricultural base that was once flood-prone, has focused on water
conservancy in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the annual investment in water
conservancy by the provincial government has reached 400 million
yuan, and funding from various sources has hit two billion yuan
each year.
</P>
<P>
A special group in charge of irrigation and water conservancy

encourages efforts of individuals and groups in the creation of
water conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, 2.8 billion cubic meters of conservancy
projects have been completed, resulting in a 320,000-ha net
increase in irrigation area. The flood-free land has increased
130,000 hectares, and 1,666 square kilometers of eroded land has
been treated.
</P>
<P>
The water conservancy projects have reaped good economic
returns. In 1996, flood prevention efforts resulted in earnings of

<HEADLINE> Party Congress as Seen by Ordinary People (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Professors and students of
Qinghua University have closely followed the 15th Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), which was held from September
12-18. Some of the teachers organized a discussion group yesterday
afternoon after watching the televised closing session.
</P>
<P>
Wu Dong, an associate professor, said "Comrade Jiang Zemin has
set forth many new topics in his report delivered at the opening
ceremony of CPC 15th National Congress, such as the ways to
realize public ownership, share-holding system and reform of
state-owned enterprises. We should work harder in our research
efforts to catch up with the situation."
</P>
<P>
Prof. Zeng Pan said he held that institutions of higher
learning are entrusted with great responsibility, as Jiang
stressed the importance of the strategy of "relying on science and
education for a prosperous China" in his opening report to the
congress.
</P>
<P>
"We can achieve greater achievements if we will focus on the
main duties of economic construction," said Zeng, who made an
inspection tour to Liuzhou Engineering Machinery Co. Ltd. in
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region together with
some other colleagues before the congress opened.
</P>
<P>
According to Zeng, his department of machinery and the
state-owned company have signed a long-term agreement for
technical upgrading and training of qualified workers.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Liu Shulin of the Humanities and Arts College said the
four tasks for academics to spread advanced thought and
technology, train more young people and produce fine spiritual
works mentioned by Jiang in his report would be a long-time goal
for all academics.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to go all-out to contribute more to advancing
material civilization and cultural and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
Veteran party members of Zhulin Township in the city of Gongyi,
central China's Henan Province, were active in organizing local
farmers to study Jiang's opening report.
</P>
<P>
Li Longsong, a veteran party member with 44 years of
membership, said that "the CPC 15th National Congress has chosen
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics as the guiding thought of the Party, which has
laid a foundation for the prosperity of China in the next century."
</P>
<P>
He hoped that ethnic minorities in China, under the leadership
of the CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the core, would
all work toward unity so as to guarantee China's overall
advancement.

Funian, Party secretary of Tuoji Island Township in Yantai City,
east China's Shandong Province, contacted fishermen at sea and
informed them of the latest news from the congress.
</P>
<P>
Capt. Wang Qingzhu said that all the fishermen busy on the job
are well-aware of the guidelines set forth at the congress, and
are all in high spirits.
</P>
<P>
Tuoji Island is a famed fishing spot in northern China, and has
a fleet of 340 ships. In recent years, all fishing units of the
township have established their own Party organizations.
</P>
<P>
North of the island, Niu Xingzhuang, head of Oil Well 45111
production team at Tianjin's Dagang Oilfield, left on September 17
for Daqing oilfield in Heilongjiang Province to attend a
recognition ceremony for outstanding oil workers.
</P>
<P>
Niu took along a file of materials he had collected about the
congress so he could study while he traveled. He gave an identical
file to his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
"The 15th CPC National Congress is a big event for both the
Party and the country. The guidelines of the meeting are related
to every drilling worker, so without careful study we cannot
understand future reform measures for our oilfield or make an
informed opinion about the reform and development," said Niu, who
has also been cited as one of China's top ten model workers.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Stronger But Off Highs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A late spurt of
profit-taking pulled the Australian dollar back from its highs of
the day, causing the unit to close stronger but below the crucial
72.00 US cents barrier.
</P>
<P>
The currency ended at 71.90 US cents up from Thursday's close
of 71.64, but off the day's high of 72.21.
</P>
<P>
The morning's rally was triggered by buying against the
crosses, particularly against the Japanese yen, Stuart Moore, St
George Bank foreign exchange manager said.
</P>
<P>
The market was then pulled back from its highs as profit-takers
moved in.
</P>
<P>
"It is a stronger close but not strong enough," Moore said
adding that "We really needed to close above 72.00 US cents to put
us in a good position for the weekend and next week."
</P>
<P>
Traders said, the rally against the yen was led by the US
dollar's surge against the same currency.
</P>
<P>
Meantime, continued speculation regarding the timing of an
Australian rate cut coupled with the outside chance of a rate hike
in the US has traders on edge.
</P>
<P>
With no real domestic data coming in the next few days, the
market is still focusing very much on the interest rate
differential, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished today at 87.58 from 86.68
against the Japanese yen and at 1.2807 from 1.2676 against the
German mark.

TAIYUAN, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The 14th International
Pittsburgh Coal Conference will be convened in Taiyuan, capital of
north China's Shanxi Province, from September 23-27.
</P>
<P>
The conference is sponsored by Pittsburgh University in the US
state of Pennsylvania. Some 328 people are scheduled to attend,
including 128 participants from overseas, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
The participants will discuss more than 20 topics, and exchange
views on scientific progress in the field.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, a seminar on coal technology and use
will be hosted by the US Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
The first conference was held in 1983. At the 12th meeting, the
then-chairperson proposed that Taiyuan be the venue of the 14th
conference in 1997, as China is the world's biggest coal producer
and consumer, and Shanxi, dubbed a "sea of coal," is a coal
production giant in China.
</P>
<P>
The Taiyuan conference will attract more Chinese experts and
will also increase China's exchanges with the rest of the world in
issues related to the coal industry, the sources said.

Zemin as its core can we reach a common understanding and work
hard to realize the lofty goal set by the congress," said Liu
Haipeng, a historian.
</P>
<P>
Fu Qingyuan, a philosopher, said that the congress is an event
that draws on the past and ushers in the future. The biggest
accomplishment of the meeting is that it has set Deng Xiaoping
Theory as the guiding ideology of the whole Party, Fu said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jiang's report to the congress fully reflects the
aspiration of the scholars and is a splendid Marxist document.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shucheng, an economist, noted that the congress has made
breakthroughs on the theory of the realization of public ownership,
which will help China to reach its goal in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The scholars agreed that they must be armed with Deng
Xiaoping Theory and carefully study Jiang's remarks on cultural
and ethical progress to move the social sciences forward in the
proper direction.

<HEADLINE> Life Almost Comes to Standstill in Malaysia's Sarawak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Life almost came to a
standstill in most parts of Malaysia's Sarawak state this
afternoon after the government announced a state of haze
emergency.
</P>
<P>
With the closure of government offices, those in the private
sector except for essential outlets, schools and kindergartens,
most people chose to stay at home rather than being exposed to the
haze, reports from the state capital Kuching said.
</P>
<P>
Even shopkeepers and restaurant operators cut short their
businesses by midday.
</P>
<P>
Those, who had to continue with their daily outdoor chores and
endure the threatening haze, had no choice but to get protection
from the gaseous atmosphere by wearing surgical masks.
</P>
<P>
With ground visibility reduced to 200 meters or less, the
scenario was quite unusual as everything is shrouded in chalky
mist.
</P>
<P>
The haze also caused havoc to hundreds of airline passengers
with all the airports in the state closed temporarily.
</P>
<P>
However, there were no major accidents reported up to this
evening, the reports quoted Kuching traffic police chief William
Poro as saying.
</P>
<P>
Motorists have been advised to drive within the 40-50
kilometers per hour speed limit and switch on their headlights for
road safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
The state of haze emergency was declared in the state earlier
today after the Air Pollutant Index (API) there surpassed the
hazardous level of between 301 and 500.
</P>
<P>
The haze situation worsened with the API reading reaching 657
by 3:00 this afternoon from this morning's 635, far beyond the
301-500 hazardous mark, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
So far police in the state have not set up road blocks or
banned driving in any area and traffic police patrolmen were on
their normal duties today.

<HEADLINE> India's Foreign Exchange Reserves Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The foreign exchange
reserves of India had reached 26.02 billion U.S. dollars by the
end of July, an increase of 3.655 billion dollars over the
previous month, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to official data released here on Thursday, however,
the surge in foreign exchange reserves is the only redeeming
feature of a dismal economic scene in the country.
</P>
<P>
Industrial growth continues to be sluggish. Electricity
generation and production in the manufacturing sector during
April-May were down by about one percentage point from the
corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade remains a cause for concern. During April-May,
exports increased by 1.8 percent in dollar terms while imports
went up by less than 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year around this time, exports registered a growth of 11.4
percent in dollar terms.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Reject Israel's Ras Al-Amud Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian organizations
in Jerusalem today rejected a compromise agreement reached
Thursday night between the Israeli government and Jewish settlers
over the settlement issue in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued here today, the organizations
said "we will not accept any compromise that keeps a single
(Jewish) settler in the heart of our Palestinian home and on the
Jerusalem Ras Al-Amud land."
</P>
<P>
The communique called on Palestinians to march against
settlement activities in Ras Al-Amud after today's noon prayers.
</P>
<P>
It also called for closure of Palestinian schools and business
institutions on Saturday and Sunday to enable students and other
people to go to Ras Al-Amud to attend protest rallies.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached by the Israeli government, Jewish
settlers and their supporter U.S. businessman Irving Moskowitz,
the three Jewish families moved into Ras Al-Amud Sunday
evacuated the two houses Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The settlers were replaced by 10 seminary students while
another 10 security and maintenance men would join them at night.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. businessman bought the houses in the Arab neighborhood
in an attempt to build 70 housing units for Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
However, the advent of the three Jewish families enraged
Palestinians and Israeli peace activists, who have been protesting
there since Sunday. Small scale clashes between Israeli security
forces and protesters occurred over the past few days.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia in Haze Emergency State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today announced a state of haze emergency for the
whole of Sarawak when the Air Pollutant Index (API) there breached
the 600 mark, far beyond the hazardous level of between 301 and
500.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said in his declaration letter that the state of
emergency would be in force until revoked.
</P>
<P>
The state of emergency, however, does not involve a curfew, and
It also does not involve any changes to the state government's
administration style and system, he said.
</P>
<P>
The haze emergency was declared to safeguard the health of the
people in the affected areas and to prevent accidents caused by
the haze, Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat, also chairman of
the National Disaster Relief Management Committee (NDRMC) said
while explaining the situation at a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
The people of Sarawak were informed of the state of emergency
by Chief Minister Abdul Taib Mahmud over radio, according to
reports from Kuching, Sarawak state's capital.
</P>
<P>
With the declaration, the Sarawak Disaster Relief and
Management Committee is empowered to order the closure of all
government and private sector offices, except the essential
services like hospitals and food supply outlets.
</P>
<P>
The chief minister announced that all factories in the state
were directed to stop operations to prevent excessive smoke
emission while the movement of vehicles must be restricted, saying
action would be taken against anyone carrying out open burning
without any warning, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
All flights into and from Kuching are canceled until further
notice due to the closure of the Kuching International Airport,
Malaysia Airlines (MAS) said in a statement here today.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last night when the API in Sarawak breached the 400
mark, the government announced to close all schools in the state
from today.
</P>
<P>
The API reading in Kuching at 10 a.m. today was 635 with
visibility limited to a mere 200 meters, the worst since the haze
began shrouding the state a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Sarawak was the first area where a state of emergency has been
declared due to the worsening haze condition.
</P>
<P>
The whole Malaysia has been shrouded in haze for the past month
due to the raging fires in vast areas of forests in neighboring
Indonesia's Sumatra and Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
The situation deteriorated last weekend with the API readings
in several areas, especially, Sarawak, Kuala Lumpur and Nilai area
of the Negeri Sembilan State, breaching the hazardous level of
301-500.
</P>
<P>
According to a Department of Environment report today, the air
quality in most parts of Malaysia recorded unhealthy and very
unhealthy levels on the API today.
</P>
<P>
Besides Sarawak, three other areas -- Melaca (Malacca), Nilai
and Kuala Lumpur recorded very unhealthy levels with the API
readings at 223, 208 and 207 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The air quality is considered good with API readings of 0-50,
moderate (51-100), unhealthy (101-200), very unhealthy (201-300)
and hazardous (301-500).
</P>
<P>
Pedestrians in the Kuala Lumpur streets are seen wearing masks
to reduce breathing in particulate matter.
</P>
<P>
Due to the haze, patients of respiratory system diseases and
conjunctivitis are on increase with the Kuala Lumpur Central
Hospital alone treated more than 8,000 such patients in the first
half of this month, according to the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the worsening haze situation, the Malaysia
Airlines were forced to announce the cancellation or retiming of
many flights, both domestic and international, during the last few
days.
</P>
<P>
The government hoped that the haze problem would be overcome
quickly because it did not want the state of emergency to be
extended nationwide, the NDRMC chairman said.
</P>
<P>
"It was not easy for the government to declare this emergency
because it touches the people's lives and the country's economy,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the chairman, the government is asking the ASEAN
countries, especially Singapore which is also affected by the
haze, France and Japan to help Indonesia put out the forest fires
because the situation had reached disastrous proportions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Royal Malaysian Air Force is preparing to use
its aircraft for cloud seeding to create rain in Malaysia to
reduce the haze.

<HEADLINE> Photo Shows False Firemen at Scene of Diana Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A photo published by the French
evening paper France Soir Thursday showed there could be several
false firemen at the crash spot of the car in which Princess Diana
was travelling, soon after the accident occurred on the night of
August 30.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Paris Fire Department, Philippe Lavoil, told
Agence France-Presse (AFP) that the "elements of dress of these
persons formally prove that they are not the firemen of Paris."
</P>
<P>
The photo, which showed the "firemen" beside the car, was first
published by the Italian news agency ANSA and shown on Italian
television on Thursday. Its authenticity was not proved.
</P>
<P>
France Soir obtained the photo from the Internet site of
Rotten, in order to "show what is perhaps a document while it is
not authenticated".
</P>
<P>
The firemen of Paris were the first rescuers who rushed to the
scene following the police, after the crash took place, according
to AFP.
</P>
<P>
Lavoil said the waistcoats with retro-reflection band these men
were wearing were too long as compared with those of their
colleagues, while their chin straps did not look like those of the
helmets of Paris firemen's at all.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the logo combining a telephone with three digits
which was printed on the rear part of these men's vehicle was
different from Paris firemen's vehicles, which usually have a
telephone and the digits 18, the emergency call number in case of
fire, he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Defense Minister Halts Questionable F-16s' Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Defense Minister
Kim Dong-jin today ordered a halt to training flights of the Air
Force's F-16 fighter jets, following crashes of two fighter jets
of the same type in the past six weeks.
</P>
<P>
Amid widespread concern over the fighters' safety, produced by
Samsung Aerospace with U.S. technical assistance, Kim also ordered
the setup of a special committee to investigate the crashes.
</P>
<P>
While officials suspected engine problems caused the crashes,
Kim ordered the Air Force to ground some 50 KF-16 fighter jets
till the probe concludes.
</P>
<P>
Engineers from U.S. producer Lockheed Martin and engine
provider Pratt &AMP; Whitney will join the special investigation.
</P>
<P>
Officials said it is not certain whether malfunctioning
resulted from defective engine parts provided by Pratt &AMP; Whitney
or poor assembly work by Samsung Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
Last week the Air Force announced that the August 6 crash of an
F-16 fighter was caused by a defect in the engine fueling system.
</P>
<P>
Another F-16 fighter crashed on Thursday although it had passed
an inspection carried out after the August 6 crash, which was
conducted and approved by Pratt &AMP; Whitney engineers, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The two crashed jets are among 36 jets assembled here by
Samsung with U.S.-provided parts. Under the program to procure 120
jets by the end of 1999, the Air Force has already purchased 12
F-16 Fighting Falcons directly from U.S. producer Lockheed Martin,
and the remaining 72 are being produced by Samsung under a license
from Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
Should the cause of the crash be attributed to a defect in the
engine, it could cause trouble for the Air Force's fighter
program, said the ministry officials.

<HEADLINE> Party Congress as Seen by Ordinary People (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Farmer-turned-manager Wang
Junyao, who lives in the economically-daring city of Wenzhou, said
the people of his hometown no longer are afraid of involvement in
private business.
</P>
<P>
"The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) has greatly boosted our Wenzhou residents' courage to do
bold experiments," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The city of Wenzhou in east China's Zhejiang province has long
been famous for its adventurous, market-oriented means of making
money since China adopted the reform and opening-up policy in the
late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Wang opened the country's first private
chartered airline in the spring of 1992, shortly after late leader
Deng Xiaoping made his famous remarks on accelerating reform and
development during a tour of south China. Wang now runs a group
with 13 branch companies, and has opened a flight route to Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Another legendary Wenzhou native is Zhu Leping. In 1989, Zhu's
private business acquired a state enterprise with 200 employees;
two years later, he caused an enthusiastic response throughout
China when his new company produced the country's first private
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
"It will never be wrong to develop productivity, make the
country prosperous and powerful, contribute to the growth of
national industry, and boost the morale of the Chinese people," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The National Party Congress has theoretically affirmed our
practices, making it possible for us to push the reform and
development at a more rapid pace," the city's mayor Qian Xingzhong
said.
</P>
<P>
In Pudong New Area of Shanghai, China's largest industrial
center, word traveled fast that Party General Secretary Jiang
Zemin had once agained mentioned Pudong in his report to the 15th
National Party Congress.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping initiated the opening up and development of
Pudong. The once-barren area has now been turned into a financial,
commercial and industrial boomtown over the past five years after
the 14th CPC Congress in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Before the 15th National Party Congress, Zhao A'mao, a Pudong
street sweeper in his 60s, bet that President Jiang would again
mention Pudong as he did in his report to the 14th congress.
</P>
<P>
The old man was overjoyed when he heard Jiang call on the
Pudong New Area to play an exemplary role in bringing forth new
systems, upgrading industries, and opening up wider.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Europe Finance Ministers Meet in Bangkok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The finance ministers of 10
Asian and 15 European countries agreed here today to strengthen
cooperation in financial supervision and regulation between the
two continents.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the finance ministers of the two
continents have met, following the First Asia-Europe Meeting
(ASEM) held in Bangkok on March 1-2, 1996.
</P>
<P>
A chairman's statement issued at the end of the one-day meeting
today said, "in view of the increasing financial integration
between Asia and Europe, the issues of financial stability and
market supervision deserve to remain on the agenda of ASEM."
</P>
<P>
For this aim, the meeting "requested the European Commission to
develop a program for more effective implementation of existing
supervisory principles and regulations."
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by about 300 delegates from the two
continents, was held at a time when some Southeast Asian economies
are experiencing currency turbulence and the European Union is
going to introduce the Euro and to create the Economic and
Monetary Union on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The ministers today stressed the need to enhance macroeconomic
policy consultation. For this purpose, deputy finance ministers
would meet regularly "to discuss international financial issues
raised in other international monetary and financial forums."
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, participants exchanged views on macroeconomic
outlook and foreign exchange markets, the creation of the Economic
and Monetary Union in Europe, and developments and cooperation in
the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also underscored the necessity to strengthen
customs cooperation among the 25 Asian and European countries in
areas of customs procedures and enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Finance Minister Liu Zhongli attended the meeting and
made a speech, in which he pointed out the new developments in
Asia's economies, and briefed his counterparts about China's
economic "soft landing", China's steady economic growth and
successful control of inflation.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence in the future of Asia's economy,
including that of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh urged Asia and Europe "to forge a common vision in
all areas, particularly in the field of economics and finance."
</P>
<P>
Among the 25 ASEM countries, the Asian 10 are seven members of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), namely Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam; and China, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Laos and Myanmar, which joined ASEAN in July this year, are not
ASEM members.
</P>
<P>
The 15 European ASEM countries are all members of the European
Union. The European Commission is also a participant in ASEM and
was represented at the meeting today.

<P>
In his report to the 15th National Party Congress, Jiang Zemin
paid special attention to the country's laid-off workers and their
reemployment situation, which came as encouraging news to them.
</P>
<P>
"I was not used to being out of a job. But now I am making good
money by selling clothing, and will support any policy that
enables us to earn more and raise our living standard," said Wang
Miyan, a laid-off worker in Nanchang of east China's Jiangxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The city government organized reemployment projects with
businesses on eight streets in downtown areas. And on Shidanan
Road, another 107 laid-off workers have joined Wang to open
business there, enjoying a 10-percent discount for stall fees.
</P>
<P>
Some 260 redundant workers in the Mining Company of the Anshan
Steel and Iron Corporation, northeast China's Liaoning Province,
no longer want to go back to their former posts, as they are now
doing just as well in market competition.
</P>
<P>
But years ago, the laid-off workers complained regularly, and
some even went so far as to appeal to the higher authorities for
help. Later they organized a factory and a company to process and
repair machinery, as well as to develop industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
"We are now able to take responsibility for our own profits and
losses, and are no longer dependent on the corporation," said the
factory's Party secretary Wang Weizheng.
</P>
<P>
Woman Worker Wu Lihua led her co-workers in appealing to the
higher-ups. But now, she is a staunch supporter of Jiang's
report. "Trimming payrolls reduced our income for the time being,
but in the long run it will benefit us all, and help enhance our
adaptation to the market competition," Wu said.

<HEADLINE> Transportation Network Formed in Guangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, September 19 (Xinhua)-- A network of land, sea and air
transportation routes has been formed in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in south China, a remote and moderately backward area in
China.
</P>
<P>
Limited by its landscape of mountains and rivers, Guangxi had
only one railway line prior to 1949 when new China was born. Since
the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
in 1992, a drive to build railway lines has reached its climax,
and a comprehensive network has taken shape.
</P>
<P>
Nankun Electric Railway, which runs from Nanning to Kunming,
will be put into operation at the end of this year. It will become
the most important artery of traffic in Southwest China.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995) period, Guangxi
also spent six billion yuan on road construction, an investment
which tripled in the five years and yielded over 1,000 kilometers
of roads annually.
</P>
<P>
Among the roads built in recent years, the most significant is
the Guilin-Beihai Expressway, which extends for 580 kilometers. A
section of 140 kilometers has been finished, and the rest is in
progress.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Guangxi is speeding up its expansion of sea and
air transportation access. A group of ports has appeared on the
shores of Beibu Bay, with a total annual handling capacity of 12
million tons and 16 one-million-ton berths.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of three new airports and the opening of
dozens of air routes, Guangxi is entering a new era of
comprehensive transportation.

<HEADLINE> Suzhou Increase Efforts to Protect South China Tigers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- South China's city of Suzhou
has set up a special fund to protect the south China tiger.
</P>
<P>
The rare species mainly lives in the southern, eastern, central
and southwestern parts of the country. Eliminated in large numbers
during the 1950s and 1960s, the tiger is near extinction.
</P>
<P>
The Suzhou Zoo has been devoting itself to artificial breeding
of the tiger since 1983, and has bred 38 tigers over the past
decade, with 25 surviving. In the first half of this year alone,
one tiger gave birth to four cubs, all of which survived.
</P>
<P>
However, the zoo, which keeps four pairs of tigers, has limited
funds and outdated facilities, which threaten the survival rate
of the tigers.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of the fund is the first step we
take to protect the south China tiger," said a zoo official, who
also called on national and international animal protection
organizations to support the protection of the tiger.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Police Detain 12 More People After Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian police have detained
another 12 people suspected in connection with a mid-day bus
explosion Thursday in downtown Cairo, which killed nine tourists
and a driver, and wounded 24 others.
</P>
<P>
The 12 people apprehended by police are shop owners suspected of
providing arms and firebombs to the attackers, and staff of a
madhouse where Saber Mohammad Farahat, one of the three assailants
escaped four days ago.
</P>
<P>
Saber and his brother were wounded in a shootout with the
police and arrested on the spot while the third fled. The Interior
Ministry said Saber is a fugitive lunatic charged with murder of
three foreigners in 1993.
</P>
<P>
A team of the Higher State Security Prosecutor's Office resumed
investigations this morning and questioned witnesses and the
injured tourists in hospital.
</P>
<P>
Police officials said Saber told investigators that the attack
was to revenge the blasphemous anti-Islamic posters in Jerusalem
which provoked outrage across the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
However, the attack was suspected to be in response to the
country's recent massive trial of Muslim militants. A tribunal
condemned four to death and sentenced another 69 to different
terms of imprisonment four days ago.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, Muslim militants have been waging a campaign aimed
to topple the government. Nearly 1,200 people have been killed,
including tourists, police officers and civilians. Most of the
attacks took place in Upper Egypt, remote from the capital.
</P>
<P>
The latest militant attack in the capital took place in April
1996 when extremists opened fire at a group of Greek tourists in
Cairo's Europa Hotel, killing 18 and injuring 16.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Interior Ministry overnight said that
when Thursday's attack occurred at 12:15 (9:15 GMT) local time, 33
German tourists were on the bus.
</P>
<P>
It said one of the three assailants clambered into the bus and
started a sporadic shooting at the tourists.
</P>
<P>
When the tourists crawled to get off the rear door, the gunman
hurled a petrol bomb inside, then ran out and placed a second bomb
under the bus, it added.
</P>
<P>
The tourists unable to flee the flaming vehicle were charred
beyond recognition. The white bus was gutted black and its glass
windows were all shattered.
</P>
<P>
A handgun, knives, and an explosive bottle were seized along
with the perpetrators. Investigations showed that the home-made
incendiary charge was a family-sized soft drink bottle filled with
petrol and kerosene.
</P>
<P>
According to Egypt's Culture Minister Farouk Hosni, the
Egyptian Antiquities Museum was not damaged by the fatal bus
explosion outside it.
</P>
<P>
After the attack, hundreds of policemen carrying plastic riot
shields and assault rifles sealed off the museum and cordoned off
the roads leading to the Taharir Square, Cairo's most crowded
commercial and business center that hosts numerous tourist
landmarks, shopping malls, government offices and plush hotels.
</P>
<P>
The attack seemed so timed and planned as to create utmost
upheaval as pedestrians and vehicles jammed Taharir Square and
thousands of tourists swarmed in and out of the Egyptian Museum.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said he has instructed the
German Embassy in Cairo and his Ministry's staff to do their best
to help the wounded and fly home the bodies of the dead.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of German Foreign Ministry declined to comment on
any likely measures Bonn would take in the wake of Thursday's
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the number one source of tourists for Egypt, with
some 460,000 people coming to visit the country annually.
</P>
<P>
An Italian tourist official said Thursday's blast will not
deter tourists from flowing into Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Official sources at Cairo International Airport said the
authorities did not receive any requests by tourist groups to
cancel reservations.

<HEADLINE> Central Asian Military Exercises Held With NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Several Central-Asian
countries and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are
holding "unprecedented" military maneuvers on September 15-21,
which set a new record of long distance air transport of troops in
the history of air force.
</P>
<P>
The maneuvers, code-named "Central Asian Peacekeeping
Camp-97", are carried out in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, which
are joined by other countries including the United States, Russia,
Turkey and Kyrgyzstan with a total of 1,400 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
During the maneuvers, 500 soldiers from the U.S. 82th airborne
division and 40 from the Central-Asian Peacekeeping Camp of
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan took off from a
U.S. military base in North Carolina in the most advanced military
C-17 planes at present.
</P>
<P>
After a non-stop flight for 17 hours with twice air refueling,
the planes finally reached the destination in the air, Chimkent
area of Southern Kazakhstan, for parachuting.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noticed that the U.S. played the "leading role"
throughout the maneuvers, while such "logical hosts" as
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan seemed to act as the
supporting roles. And, Russia appeared to be only a guest
performer.
</P>
<P>
Virtually, analysts said, the maneuvers show again the U.S.
strategic attempt to penetrate into the Central Asian region while
squeezing out Russia.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Warns Against Deportation of Algerian Asylum-seekers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR) Thursday warned against "hasty
deportation" of rejected Algerian asylum-seekers from European
countries in recent months.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that not all asylum-seekers from Algeria have
legitimate claims to asylum," said Dennis McNamara, UNHCR's
director of international protection. "However, we consider that a
significant number of those currently fleeing Algeria are in
genuine need of international protection."
</P>
<P>
Last year, among the 5,950 Algerian asylum applicants in 14
European countries, Canada and the United States, only 670, or
eight percent, were approved for acceptance.
</P>
<P>
Violence and terrorism have been on the rise since the last
quarter of 1996, UNHCR said in a press release, adding that
political assassinations and car bomb attacks have claimed many
lives in Algeria particularly in recent months.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR said that certain groups of asylum-seekers could face
serious security problems if they are returned to Algeria at this
time.

<HEADLINE> Standing Committee Member of CPC Politburo (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- When he entered the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the 14th Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) five years ago, Hu Jintao was
the youngest member in this top decision-making body of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
His re-election into the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the 15th CPC Central Committee here today reflected the
Party's confidence in this young and energetic leader, who is now
54 years old.
</P>
<P>
When he served as a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the 14th Party Central Committee, Hu was in
charge of Party affairs, serving concurrently as president of the
Party School of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, he has won praises from all quarters
for his outstanding theoretical attainment and his sure and steady
style of work.
</P>
<P>
When he was elected into the CPC Central Committee 15 years
ago, Hu was only 39, also the youngest.
</P>
<P>
Born in December 1942 in Jixi County, east China's Anhui
Province, Hu studied hydroelectric engineering in Beijing-based
Qinghua University, China's most prestigious polytechnic, where he
joined the CPC in April 1964.
</P>
<P>
As an outstanding student in his department, Hu had the dream
of becoming an expert on hydropower. He once said that it was not
his original intention to go into politics.
</P>

once said that economic development in poverty-stricken areas
requires people's dedication.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1988, Hu became secretary of the CPC Tibet
Autonomous Regional Committee. During his four-year stay there,
despite the harsh natural conditions on the Tibet Plateau, Hu

person, and was very good at coping with complicated situations
with firm principles and flexible tactics.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the basic qualities of a leader, Hu himself once
said that a good leader must have firm belief and lofty pursuit,
do solid work, seek no fame or gain, do away with air of
bureaucracy and share the feeling of the masses.
</P>
<P>
A good leader should encourage democracy and also be capable of
taking resolute action at critical moments, and must love life, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Hu's experience with China's youth work has enabled him to have
a better understanding of the country's younger generation. He
once noted that in the process of China's reform, the Chinese
youth should not only have a sense of urgency and a sense of
mission, but also a good understanding of the hardships and
complicated nature of the reform.
</P>
<P>
"Do not cherish excessively high expectations while your
psychological capacity to bear upon is low," he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Hu loves literature and art, with a special interest in movies,
operas and novels. He was a member of the students' dancing team

Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the 14th CPC Central
Committee in 1992. In March 1993, he was also elected chairman of
the Eighth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
During his term of office in Tianjin, he boldly reformed
government work, with focus on improving the urban housing and
public transit systems. His resolute and practical work style
was widely acclaimed by the local people.
</P>
<P>
People of Tianjin still remembered his call-in radio and TV
programs broadcast live. Representatives of citizens raised
questions and Li answered them one by one, all in concrete terms.
The topics of open discussions usually centered on reform and
issues concerning the daily life of the people.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan was elected member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and member of the
Central Committee's Secretariat at the Fourth Plenary Session of
the 13th CPC Central Committee in 1989. His responsibilities were
in the ideological field.

he published a book entitled "On Doing Practical Things for the
People"
</P>
<P>
In early 1993, Li was elected chairman of the Eighth CPPCC
National Committee. After taking office, Li injected renewed vigor
into the CPPCC's work with his enlightened political views and
practical attitude. The basic functions of the CPPCC in the past
had been described as political consultation and democratic
supervision. Li added new contents -- participation in and
deliberation of state affairs. The CPC Central Committee issued a
notice to Party committees at all levels, requiring them to create
conditions for local CPPCC committees to expand their work. The
move has greatly uplifted the status of the CPPCC in the political
activities of China.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan sets great store by the method of study. At the 21st
meeting of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National Committee
of the CPPCC, he recommended a method of study that integrates
learning of theories with reviewing experiences and studying
practical work. One the one hand, he said, reading books is a kind
of study and so is application and more important at that. On the
other hand, the process of book reading is in fact a process of
studying practical work and the process of working is a process of
learning and applying theories.
</P>
<P>
Li has wide-ranging interests, with a particular love for
Peking Opera. Playing tennis or table tennis and fishing are also
his hobbies.
</P>
<P>
Although Li has been a state leader, his wife remained a
factory worker until her retirement.

</P>
<P>
Jiang first expressed his appreciation for the journalists'
coverage of the 15th CPC National Congress, which ended here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very pleased to meet with you here, journalists from home
and abroad," Jiang told the press. "I should like to thank you for
covering the 15th National Congress of the CPC."
</P>
<P>
He then introduced other members of the new CPC top leadership
to the press, saying, "Li Peng is premier of the State Council;
Zhu Rongji, executive vice-premier; Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference; Hu Jintao, member of the Secretariat of the CPC
Central Committee; Wei Jianxing, secretary of the CPC Central

</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that the 15th CPC National Congress has
completed its agenda and has come to a successful conclusion.
</P>
<P>
He called the congress "a great success," adding that it was
convened at a time when the new century is coming and China's
reform, opening-up and modernization drive are entering a crucial
stage.
</P>
<P>
"It is of extremely great significance to have convened such
a congress that inherits the past and ushers in the future," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory has been
the soul of this congress, and establishing Deng Xiaoping Theory
as the guiding ideology of the whole Party is the most important
outcome of this congress," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"This will inevitably have a major and far-reaching impact on
our efforts to attain the three-step strategic goals set forth
by Deng Xiaoping and build China into a prosperous, strong,
democratic and culturally advanced socialist country in the next
century," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"At the turn of the century, facing unprecedented challenges
and opportunities, we are full of confidence in realizing the
country's magnificent objectives for the next century," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although many difficulties may still lie ahead as we press
forward, so long as we hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory, firmly adhere to the Party's basic line, and work hard
together under the guidance of the basic line, principles and
policies adopted at the 15th National Party Congress, we are sure
to achieve the goal of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that China will have a better future, and we also
wish the world a better future," he added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting lasted about 20 minutes, and ended with Jiang
saying in English "Thank you for coming" to all journalists.

Company, and vice-director of the Clerk Department of the Qingdao

</P>
<P>
Jiang Chunyun came under attack from 1966 to 1970 during the
Cultural Revolution and worked in the countryside and a "May 7"
cadre school. He worked at the General Office of the Shandong
Provincial Revolutionary Committee between 1970 and 1977, and at

<P>
In the ensuing years, Jiang served as deputy, then director of
foreign affairs department of the No. 1 Ministry of
Machine-Building Industry. He speaks good English, Russian and
Romanian, and knows some Japanese and French.
</P>
<P>
Before he became Shanghai Mayor in 1985, Jiang served as
minister of Electronics Industry.
</P>
<P>
His unique career experiences have enabled him to observe and
solve problems from the perspectives of profound relations between
China and the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was the first planner of Shenzhen, China's first special
economic zone (SEZ). In 1979 when the late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping proposed to build SEZs in China, Jiang was the first to
settle concrete matters in Shenzhen on behalf of the central
government. He was then serving as deputy director and
concurrently secretary general of the State Import and Export
Administration and the State Foreign Investment Administration.
Facing the wilderness, Jiang put forward his guiding ideas that
had a far-reaching effect on Shenzhen's construction in the
following years. "All construction projects in the SEZ should be
started from a long-term point of view and in line with
international standards." The development of Shenzhen over the
past 10 years and more has testified to the correctness of his
ideas.
</P>
<P>
Soon after Jiang became Shanghai mayor in 1985, he planned a
series of key infrastructure projects using overseas capitals. The
city raised 3.2 billion US dollars from international capital
market, of which 1.4 billion dollars were poured into such key
projects as the city's subway, Nanpu Bridge, polluted water
treatment, airport expansion and program-controlled telephone
exchanges. People are stunned by the profound changes that have
taken place in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was elected member of the 12th CPC Central Committee in
September of 1982. In November, 1987, Jiang was elected member of
the Political Bureau at the First Plenary Session of the 13th CPC
Central Committee. He was elected member of the Standing Committee
of the Political Bureau in June of 1989 at the Fourth Plenary
Session of the 13th Central Committee, general secretary of the
CPC Central Committee. Five months later, he was elected chairman
of the CPC Central Military Commission at the Fifth Plenary
Session of the 13th Central Committee. At the Third Session of the
Seventh National People's Congress, he was elected chairman of the
Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China
(PRC). At the first Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee,

Political Bureau, member of its Standing Committee, general
secretary of CPC's Central Committee and at the Eighth National
People's Congress held in March, 1993, he was elected president of

During the past eight years, what he always puts high on his
agenda is grain, cotton, edible oil and vegetable production and
supply, all closely related to the people's daily life. "Any
reform should benefit the majority of the people and it should be
carried out within the capacity of the people to bear upon," he
often said. Thanks to the implementation of these principles, the
thorny reforms of the country's public finance, taxation, monetary
and investment systems have been going on smoothly without sharp
fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
Over the past eight years, Jiang toured almost all provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities except Taiwan. What he is
concerned with most is the life of the people in poor and remote
areas where ethnic groups live. He initiated the ambitious
anti-poverty campaign in 1992, vowing to eradicate poverty before
the end of the century. Thanks to the intensified efforts, China's
population under the poverty line has been reduced from 80 million
to 58 million by 1996.
</P>
<P>
Jiang loves to make friends with intellectuals. He has many
good friends in economic, scientific, art and press circles. Some
friends called him a "scholar statesman." Early in 1987 when he
was still Shanghai mayor, he initialed a bi-monthly seminar with
scholars in the theoretical circle in Shanghai. Each time he would
raise a hot or sensitive or difficult issue for the experts and
scholars he invited to discuss.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stresses national self-esteem, self-confidence, national
dignity and the cohesion of the Chinese nation. Jiang is highly
accomplished in classic Chinese literature and often quotes
ancient poems off-hand. Jiang has a wide range of interest and
plays piano and erhu, a two-string traditional Chinese musical
instrument. In his spare time, he may indulge himself in the music
of Mozart and Beethoven. In his eyes, the Chinese and Western
cultures are "communicable."
</P>
<P>
Jiang loves reading and devotes most of his spare time to
reading the latest science books. He also loves to read Mark
Twain. Sources close to him said Jiang could recite the monologue
of "To be or not to be" in Hamlet and "Ode to the West Wind" by
Shelley. In his last official tour of Russia, his analysis of the
literary masterpieces by Leo Tolstoy and other Russian authors
surprised the Russian guides.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yeping, his wife, graduated from the Shanghai Foreign
Languages Institute and used to be head of an electrical
engineering research institute in Shanghai. Now she has retired.
The couple have two sons. Jiang Mianheng, the eldest, obtained his
doctor's degree in electronic engineering in the United States.
After returning to Shanghai, he has been appointed director of the
Shanghai Metallurgical Research Institute. Their younger son,
Jiang Miankang, studied in Germany for a while after finishing
Shanghai No. 2 University of Engineering. Now he is a researcher
of software at the Shanghai Underground Pipeline Information
System.

<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Rongji, one of the top
decision-makers of the Communist Party of China (CPC), has
frequently been seen beaming with smiles that were hardly visible
in the past.
</P>
<P>
Zhu has his reasons.
</P>
<P>
After three years of successful macro-economic control with the
primary task to curb inflation, the overheated Chinese economy has
cooled down to a "soft landing" and a good situation rarely seen
in the world has been prevailing. With these achievements, Zhu,
acknowledged as an economic planner, was re-elected member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee, with his ranking next only to Jiang Zemin and Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, 68, was born in Changsha, capital of central China's Hunan
Province. He joined the Party in October, 1949. After graduation
from prestigious Qinghua University where he majored in electrical
engineering, he served as deputy head of the production planning
office of the Northeast China Ministry of Industries. He then
worked in the State Planning Commission and the State Economic
Commission for years, where he was acknowledged as an official who
"knows economics."
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Zhu was appointed mayor of Shanghai, China's largest
industrial and financial city.
</P>
<P>
The three-year of his office as Shanghai mayor saw tremendous
changes in the development and opening-up of Pudong, and in
telecommunications, urban construction and communications. For
these he won confidence inside and outside the Party and
acclaim from the common people.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Zhu was appointed vice-premier of the State Council
and director of the State Council Production Office. Zhu Rongji
has focused his attention on tackling tough economic problems in
industry, agriculture and finance.
</P>
<P>
Soon after he came to Beijing from Shanghai, Zhu launched a
drive to disentangle the "debt chains" of state enterprises. He
took the lead in eliminating IOUs in the purchase of grain for the
sake of farmers. He served concurrently as governor of the central
bank to straighten out the financial order. Deng Xiaoping once
praised him as "havig his own views and his own measures and
being resolute and bold in tackling problems and knowing
economics."

<P>
In 1992, the investment in fixed assets was overheated; supply
of money was excessive; prices soared; and raising funds by
issuing stocks heated up and the whole financial order was
disrupted. With the support of Jiang Zemin and Li Peng, Zhu, as
vice-premier and head of the State Council Economic and Trade
Office, enforced strict macro-economic control measures to
resolutely check the runaway currency issue, laying the foundation
for controlling inflation and bringing down prices. But he did not
advocate overall entrenchment. Instead, he came down sharply only
on duplicated projects at low levels and the sectors that would
result in "bubble economy". On the other hand, backed projects
in communications, energy, agriculture and sectors that promised
new points of economic growth. In so doing, he avoided big
fluctuations and at the same time, maintained a healthy
development of the economy.

Now Zhu Rongji has turned to the reforms of state enterprise,
strengthening of agriculture and continued implementation of the
moderately tight monetary policy. He faces both opportunities and
challenges, observers note. He has much room to display his
talent in economic reform.
</P>
<P>
"Strict government" is the principle he upholds. He deports
himself in a calm and unhurried manner, but he is decisive in
handling affairs and quick to act. He cannot tolerate the dilatory
style of work at which he would lash without mercy. A news report
said that once he was extensively hailed for criticizing some
units openly at a National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"My criticism is too severe sometimes and that is not good,"
he said."But why you start moving only after the leaders fly
into a rage? It is not that you cannot do it." The thing is that
you do not want to do it. But he declared that he only criticizes
people but does not fix anybody.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also shows his emotional side sometimes. At the 80th
anniversary of the founding of Qinghua University, Zhu defied the
fatigue from a long European state visits and rushed to the
school, with his hearty greetings.
</P>
<P>
Between 1993 and 1995, Zhu served as member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee,
vice premier of the State Council and concurrently governor of the
People's Bank of China. Since 1995, he has kept the positions of
Standing Committee member and vice premier.
</P>
<P>
Zhu has a good command of English. He is rarely seen speaking
from script. His eloquent speech has always riveted the attention
of the audience. Zhu is also a Peking Opera fan.
</P>
<P>
His wife, Lao An is vice chairman of the board of the directors
of China International Engineering and Consulting Corporation. She
and Zhu were in the same schools twice in their lives, first the
Hunan First Provincial Middle School and then Qinghua University.
They have two daughters.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Bank Says Peso to Stabilize Before Year End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Central Bank
governor Gabriel Singson expressed confidence here today that the
peso would stabilize between 28 and 30 pesos to one U.S. dollar
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Singson made the prediction in the midst of reports that some
52 commercial banks in the country are becoming nervous about the
outcome of the forthcoming Sunday protest rally against a second
term for President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
The financial sector and the stock market are jittery because
they do not know what will happen during and after the rally,
coupled with the looming political uncertainties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Singson clarified to the media that the Central Bank will still
stick to its decision of not intervening in the prevailing
currency problem but to let the market forces decide the exchange
rate between the peso and the greenback.
</P>
<P>
Under the present situation, the Central Bank only makes its
bid to buy dollars when the opportunity is good and sell them when
the offer is good, he said.
</P>
<P>
The peso fell to a new record low of 34.05 pesos to one dollar
on Thursday amid fears that a political crisis would come to the
country if any act of violence outbreaks during the Sunday rally.
</P>
<P>
Some 1 million people were expected to attend the rally called
by church leaders and former President Corazon Aquino to denounce
charter change moves seeking a second term for President Ramos.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Leader Trapped in N. Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Joseph Kony, the leader of
the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), is trapped in a vast
uninhabited valley in northern Uganda, a senior officer said.
</P>
<P>
Colonel James Kazini, the commander of the fourth division,
told The New Vision in northern city of Gulu that the rebel
leader fell into a trouble condition without food on their way to
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report quoted Dickens Canowira, an intelligence
officer of LRA defecting to the government troops as saying that
Kony has escaped from northern Uganda to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
But Kazini said the rebel leader was appealing his commanders
in Kitgum district for food help from Aswa valley between
northern districts of Kitgum and Gulu. But the rebel commanders
themselves were seeking hideouts to escape heavy pressure from
the government troops.
</P>
<P>
However, it is hard to trace the rebel leader and his 40
bodyguards in a vast valley, the commander added.
</P>
<P>
Army sources revealed the rebel leader penetrated into
northern Uganda when Jabelain in southern Sudan where Kony's camp
located was under artillery attack from Sudan People's Liberation
Army.
</P>
<P>
LRA is a rebel group with 450 fighters operating in northern
Uganda and has bases in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Jeje Odongo, the State Minister for Defense, praised
recently the army for secceeding in controlling the situation in
the north and the west.

<HEADLINE> General Secretary of the CPC Central </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin was re-elected
General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) at the
First Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee here today
following the last CPC National Congress in this century.
</P>
<P>
At the same plenum, he was also re-elected chairman of the
CPC Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
His re-election as head of the world's largest ruling party
with 58 million members is viewed as the measure of the confidence
of the Chinese people he enjoys.
</P>
<P>
Over the past eight years when Jiang served as the top leader
of the Party, China has been in a period featuring "most stable
political situation, the strongest national strength, the most
active diplomatic activities and the most remarkable improvement
in the people's life," said a local analyst.
</P>
<P>
Overseas press commented that the prestige of CPC's third
generation leadership is just the kind of prestige that could be
expected from a country where economy has registered double-digits
growth for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
Jiang officially took over the post of Party General Secretary
in June, 1989 when China faced great difficulties, politically,
economically and diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
In just two years, Jiang succeeded in bringing about big
changes in the situation. The GNP grew steadily at an average
annual rate of 12.1 percent, the fastest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was elected President of the People's Republic of China
in March 1993 and continued to serve for another term as Chairman
of the Central Military Commission. His status as the core of the
leadership is attributable to his outstanding achievements,
ability and a steady and down-to-earth style of work.
</P>
<P>
Born on August 17, 1926, of an intellectual family in Yangzhou,
a culturally famous city in east China's Jiangsu Province, Jiang
received his higher education in the prestigious Shanghai Jiaotong
University and his major was electrical engineering.
</P>
<P>
Both his grandfather and father were noted local scholars.
</P>
<P>
During his college years, Jiang participated in the CPC-led
students movements and joined the Communist Party of China in
1946.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of New China, Jiang served as associate
engineer, deputy director of a factory, section head of an
enterprise. In 1955, He went to the then Soviet Union and worked
in the Stalin Automobile Works as a trainee for one year. After
his return home, he served as deputy division head, deputy chief
power engineer, director of a branch factory, and deputy director,
director of factories and research institutes in Changchun,
Shanghai and Wuhan.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has called
for an urgent meeting of Southern African Development Community
(SADC) ministers to discuss the impact of the impending El Nino
weather phenomenon on the region.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Sowetan Today quoted Constitutional Development
and Provincial Affairs Minister Valli Moosa as reporting that the

of surface waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean. It has global
influences on atmospheric circulation patterns around the world,
leading to either abnormally high rainfall or severe droughts.
</P>
<P>
Predictions are that in Southern Africa the normal summer
rains from December to March will be disrupted, leading to a
severe drought.
</P>
<P>
The South African Cabinet has approved the establishment of
joint operations by the government departments in preparation for
the drought.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Water Affairs has called for the

<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, September (Xinhua) -- Zambia and Tanzania have agreed
to enhance their cooperation in various economic fields.
</P>
<P>
The joint permanent commission of cooperation agreed here
Thursday that the two neighboring countries will promote their
cooperation in trade, industry, communications, transport,
energy, tourism, agriculture, education, youth, sport, culture
and gender issues, Times of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to revise the 1982 trade agreement
to encourage private involvement in the promotion of the
bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued at the end of the three-day sixth
session of the joint commission, the commission recognized the
need to put in place interim measures to promote trade in view of
Tanzania's decision to suspend the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) tariffs in favor of its own ones.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Home Affairs Minister Ali Ameir Mohamed, head of the
Tanzanian delegation to the session, said his country will
seriously consider Zambia's complaint against Tanzania's tariffs.
</P>
<P>
"We will inform our government about your concerns on tariffs.
We understand the effects of our tariffs on Zambian traders but
cannot do much at this meeting because our tariffs were passed by
parliament," Mohamed said.
</P>
<P>
In the on-going commercialization program at Tazara (Tanzania
and Zambian Railways), the commission implored management to
retrench on the basis of fair implementation of the exercise.

HARARE, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert

<HEADLINE> PNA Demands All Jews Evacuate Ras Al-Amud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat said the PNA demands the
evacuation of all Jews from Ras Al-Amud.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a PNA Cabinet meeting last night which
discussed an internal arrangement reached by the Israelis to
resolve the Ras Al-Amud, the focus of the latest dispute between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The meeting rejected any deal that allows Jews in East
Jerusalem Arab neighborhood, the Palestinian radio Wafa reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Arafat said, this would represent another type of
Jewish settlement, which is a gross violation of the agreements
Israel signed with PNA.
</P>
<P>
After four days and a full night of discussions, Israeli
government and American businessman Irving Moskowitz reached an
agreement last night that brought about a peaceful evacuation of
the three Jewish families which moved into Ras Al-Amud on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulates that after the voluntary evacuation,
in the two houses of Moskowitz's property will live 10 religious
students, and another 10 security and maintenance men will join
them at night.
</P>
<P>
Moskowitz, the Florida millionaire who bought the two houses
and 3.5 acres of land in Ras Al-Amud in the center of Arab
neighborhood, played a key role in supporting the Jewish
settlers' occupation of the houses.
</P>
<P>
He was criticized by Israeli opposition parties, parliament
members and peace activists for playing a dangerous game at this
time in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Islamic and nationalist groups issued a call to
Palestinians last night to arrive in Ras Al-Amud after mosque
prayers today to protest against Jewish presence in the area.
</P>
<P>
Commenting about the Israeli agreement on Ras Al-Amud, PNA
Minister responsible for Jerusalem Faisal Husseini said this was
not a compromise and it merely turned the building into a
religious seminary.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli's opposition Labor Party leader Ehud Barak
warned that if seminary students are allowed to stay inside the

<HEADLINE> Donors Pledge $180m Aid to Zambia's Power Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- About seven donor agencies
have pledged commitment to meeting 90 percent of the required 200
million U.S. Dollars for Zambia's power rehabilitation project.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's Energy Minister Suresh Desai confirmed the pledge
here Thursday, Times of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
Following a donor consultative meeting held last Wednesday,
the World Bank has raised its earlier pledge from 50 million
dollars to 75 million dollars, while the European Investment Bank
project management committee approved its commitment for the
rehabilitation of power stations of the Victoria Falls and Kariba
North Bank on the southern borders, according to the energy
minister.
</P>
<P>
Other tentative commitments are received from Norwegian
Development Agency and Development Bank of South Africa, Swedish
International Development Agency, Finnish Development Agency and
Development Bank of France.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Zambian government has commenced
negotiations with the agencies to finalize agreements in the wake
of the consultative meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government has embarked on a 195 million dollars
project to rehabilitate all power stations in the country.
</P>
<P>
The project covers the power stations of Kafue Gorge, Kariba
north bank, Victoria Falls, Kariba Dam, and the transmission and
distribution systems in Lusaka, and two northern cities of Kitwe
and Ndola.
</P>
<P>
Zambia became self-sufficient in hydroelectric power in the
1970s. But the conditions of its power stations, most of which
were completed twenty years ago, have deteriorated.

<HEADLINE> Paris-Based Chinese Paper Hails 15th CPC National Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Paris-based Chinese
newspaper "Nouvelle d'Europe" in an editorial today congratulated
the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
The editorial, entitled "China Will Make Firmer Trans-Century
Steps", said that the spirit of the 15th National Congress of the
CPC is "to hold high the banner of the theory of Deng Xiaoping."
</P>
<P>
It said that the congress will be registered in history because
the CPC decided to write the theory of Deng Xiaoping into the CPC
Charter during the sessions of the congress.
</P>
<P>
It praised the congress for defining the present phase of
development of China as the "preliminary stage of socialism", and
thus clearly recognizing the status of China as a developing
nation.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said it is widely discussed among overseas
Chinese about the "third liberation of thinking" of the CPC since
the party adopted the policy of reform and opening up, which is a
further breakthrough in the reform of the economic system of China.
</P>
<P>
It said that the congress decided to push forward this
breakthrough economic reform by searching for "multiplization of
the forms of state ownership".
</P>
<P>
This will solve the "old and big" problem of state enterprises,
and will draw more foreign investment, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
It also praised the congress for making "honest discussion and
drawing" about the political reform, construction of spiritual
civilization, peaceful reunification of the country,
anti-corruption campaign, and reduction of the scale of the
military.

<HEADLINE> Australian FM Praises China's Party Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said today his country welcomed Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's pledge at the 15th National Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party to make continued positive contribution to
regional stability and economic dynamism.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone with Xinhua, Downer said: "The party congress is
an important event on China's political calendar, and President
Jiang's speech confirms China's economic reform program initiated
in 1978 by Deng Xiaoping."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome President Jiang's reaffirmation of China's
continued positive contribution to the region's stability and
economic dynamism, and we are looking forward to continuing to
work together with China in the regional and global affairs,"
Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"China's impressive economic performance has been, and will
continue to be, a positive factor to the world development," he
said.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that the Chinese leaders are continuing to place a
high priority to the economic development and the raising of the
people's living standard, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"It's also clear they are committed to China's continued
partnership in regional and global affairs," he added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister spoke highly of the recent development of
the economic and political relationship between Australia and
China.
</P>
<P>
As the recent White Paper on Foreign Affairs and Trade points
out, "China will remain one of Australia's key relationships", he
said.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the two countries have a relationship based on
shared interests and mutual respect. Australia remains committed
to the One China policy which has been pursued by the Australian
government since 1972.
</P>
<P>
The economic relationship between the two countries is "going
from strength to strength", the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade has more than doubled over the past five years,
exceeding eight billion Australian dollars (5.6 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1996. China is Australia's fifth largest trade partner
and could rise to the third by the year 2000, he added.
</P>
<P>
The political relationship between Australian and China is
"also maturing," the foreign minister said, adding that such a
relationship is reflected in the defense talks, the expansion of
bilateral disarmament talks to include regional security, and the
establishment of human rights dialogue.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Non-oil Exports Grow 10.6 Percent Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's non-oil exports
increased by an average 10.6 percent annually between 1991 and
1996, the Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Indonesia's exports stood at 49.8 billion U.S.
dollars, of which 34.9 billion dollars were non-oil exports,
Antara quoted Minister of Industry and Trade Tungky Ariwibowo as
saying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The value of industrial exports had been dominant among non-oil
exports in the 1991-96 period, accounting for about 73 percent of
non-oil exports, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The value of industrial exports increased from 12.8 billion
dollars in 1991 to 27.7 billion dollars in 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the industrial sector experienced an average
annual growth of 12.1 percent and made the biggest contribution to
the gross national product (GNP), he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the industrial sector contributed 16.72 percent to the
GNP, Tungky said.
</P>
<P>
However, Tungky said the value of non-oil exports since the
beginning of this year fell below the target. But he did not give
specific figures.
</P>
<P>
Tungky said from 1991 to 1996, Indonesia' imports increased by
11.6 percent annually, and the value of imports in 1996 stood at
42.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Though the country's trade balance still enjoys a surplus, the
growth of imports over the past two years has been faster than
that of exports," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Seeks Capital Account Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) is seeking an amendment to its charter, allowing it to
promote the orderly liberalization of global capital movements, a
senior IMF official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"It is likely that the Fund will develop the analogies for the
capital account of the present Articles 8 and 14 that apply to the
current account," Stanley Fischer, IMF first deputy managing
director, told participants in an IMF seminar.
</P>
<P>
Liberalization of the capital account can bring major benefits
to countries whose residents and governments are able to borrow
and lend on more favorable terms in more sophisticated markets, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Their own financial markets will become more efficient and they
will attain a better allocation of both savings and investment,
therefore their economies will grow more rapidly in a more
sustainable manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that a net total of 235 billion U.S. dollars in
foreign capital flowed to developing countries in 1996, nearly 0.8
percent of world Gross Domestic Product and more than two percent
of the total Gross Domestic Product of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
But Fischer warned that while enormous opportunities may emerge
from free capital flows, significant challenges and risks will
also exist.
</P>
<P>
He said that the currency crisis in Southeast Asian nations at
present is a reminder of the risks.
</P>
<P>
"Capital account liberalization increases the vulnerability of
the economy to swings in market sentiment," Fischer said, adding
that almost always these swings are rationally based, but they may
on occasion be excessive.
</P>
<P>
"This is a valid concern to those contemplating capital account
liberalization, and for the international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Fischer believed that capital movements are
"mostly appropriate".
</P>
<P>
"Currency crises do not blow up out of a clear blue sky but
rather start as rational reactions to policy mistakes or external
shocks," he said.

TIRANA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- The Tirana police arrested an
Albanian Socialist parliamentary member today who shot at a rival
lawmaker at the parliament, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Azem Hajdari of the opposition Democratic Party was shot and
seriously wounded by Gafur Mazreku two days after the two
exchanged blows during a parliamentary session.
</P>
<P>
After the shooting, some pro-Democrats gathered in front of the
buildings of the parliament and the headquarters of the Democratic
Party, shouting slogans in protest against the shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian interior ministry, the Tirana police and special
forces have taken measures to keep the capital calm, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Fatos Nano ruled out any political nature in the
shooting, saying that it was an "ordinary crime" and Mazreku would
be responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
He said everybody in the country is equal before law and the
parliamentary member who shot must be punished by the law.
</P>
<P>
Nano added that Albania needs peace and the Albanian people

<HEADLINE> Hamas Activists Netted For Plotting Kidnapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces
have arrested six members of the militant Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) for planning to kidnap hardline Jerusalem Mayor
Ehud Olmert.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the six, four from Jerusalem and
two from the West Bank, were arrested on August 19, a day before
they planned to carry out the attack in Jerusalem's Malha shopping
mall.
</P>
<P>
Security officials in the mall detained some suspects when
they were checking out the place while carrying bags with nails to
test the security there. This led to the arrests of other cell
members involved in the plot.
</P>
<P>
The cell was reportedly responsible for two bombings in an old
Tel Aviv bus stop in January this year, in which 12 people were
wounded. It was also believed by Israeli security to be connected
to the March 21 bombing attack in a central Tel Aviv cafe, in
which three were killed and dozens more wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israeli news agency Itim quoted Jerusalem police chief Yair
Yitzhaki as saying that Olmert and the other targeted personality
had been on special watch for the past month.
</P>
<P>
Security has been reinforced recently at the Malha mall, with a
large number of security guards stationed. Strict searches have
been conducted with the help of electronic devices to detect bombs
in all the shops in the market.
</P>
<P>
Undercover guards have also been deployed in crowded areas of
the mall to prevent terror attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,000 overseas Chinese
and foreigners last night visited an exhibition illustrating the
outstanding economic and cultural achievements China has made over
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Many of the visitors had high words of praise for the
grand-scale display, the largest of its kind since the founding of
New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
"I am very glad to see and appreciate the achievements the
Chinese government has made in improving the status of children
and women in the past years," said Keshab B. Mathema, area
representative for China and Mongolia to the United Nations
Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
Among the visitors strolling through the Beijing Exhibition
Hall were compatriots from the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, Taiwan and Macao, representatives from embassies, UN
organizations, foreign businesses and news agencies, and foreign
experts. So far, nearly 400,000 people from both abroad and at

</P>
<P>
Arthur N. Holcombe, resident representative of UNDP, said that
he was astonished to see the efforts China has made in its

<HEADLINE> Vegetables, Fruit Sold in Beijing Safe to Eat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Tests conducted by Beijing's
quality control authorities show that the vast majority of
vegetables and fruit sold in the Chinese capital are safe to eat,
with the trace amounts of pesticide detectable below the state
standards.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the Municipal Technology
Inspection Bureau has conducted spot checks of vegetables and
fruit sold in all Beijing's major farm and sideline product
markets.
</P>
<P>
Results show that the amount of pesticide on most of the more
than 200 samples of 20-plus varieties of vegetables and fruit are
below the state standards.
</P>
<P>
To improve the accuracy of the testing, the bureau has spent
more than 600,000 yuan purchasing advanced testing equipment. It
has also created files on the variety of contaminated vegetables
and fruit to prevent them from getting onto local dinner tables.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Enhance Role of Macroeconomic Doctor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) is acting as a "macroeconomic doctor" to keep
surveillance on members' economic health and design policies
necessary for adjustment, said an economist here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the one-day "Asia and the IMF" seminar, Michael
Mussa, director of the IMF Research Department, centered his
topic on the organization's approach to macroeconomic policy.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the IMF's recent economic rescue package of 17.2
billion U.S. dollars to help Thailand out of the currency
turbulence, Mussa said: "The IMF is not a passive adviser, but an
intellectual player (in the financial crisis)."
</P>
<P>
Today, surveillance and design of policies are the two major
roles of the IMF, founded in 1945 as one of the Bretton Woods
institutions, according to Mussa.
</P>
<P>
The IMF official said that in tandem with the fast economic
growth, Asian economies have experienced tremendous changes, from
central-controlled system to market-based mechanism, and from
fixed exchange rate regime to more flexible arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, global integration has brought large flow of capital
in and out of the region, making economies vulnerable to external
shocks, he added.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Sheng, deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA), shared Mussa's views, saying that rapid capital
flow has posed challenges on macroeconomic management since it is
difficult for policy makers to sense the market sentiment as
quickly as expected.
</P>
<P>
As to the choice of exchange rate systems, he said: "There is
no one size that fits all. What is right for one economy is not
right for another."
</P>
<P>
"Macroeconomy is the sum of microeconomy," said Sheng. The
design of policies should not be an adjustment on fiscal or
exchange rate side, but adjustment on areas in details, such as
banking fragility and efficiency of payment system.
</P>
<P>
In a following session at the seminar, Jack Boorman, director
of the IMF's Policy Development and Review Department, explored
the change of focus the IMF should have in responding to global
economic change.
</P>
<P>
Boorman analyzed: "Market does not operate in a vacuum, and
there is a role for the government, such as setting up legal and
supervisory framework and providing basic infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the IMF should deepen its efforts in four
directions -- to enhance surveillance activities, strengthen
operation of markets, provide technical assistance, and mitigate
the risk of marginalization of its poor members.

<HEADLINE> HK Newspapers Hail Conclusion of 15th CPC Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Major Hong Kong newspapers
hailed today in their editorials the successful conclusion of the
15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
The editorial of the Wen Wei Po said that the last congress of
China's ruling party in this century has accomplished its
historical mission of carrying forward the cause and forging into
the future.
</P>
<P>
The 15th CPC congress, which has drawn attention domestically
and abroad, has laid a solid foundation for CPC building and the
development of China in the 21st century in the fields of
ideological theory and organizational affiliation, the editorial
noted.
</P>
<P>
The congress has designated the Deng Xiaoping Theory as the
guiding ideology of the Party. This is a historical decision made
by the Party after summing up 20 years of successful experience in
China's reform and modernization drive, it added.
</P>
<P>
The editorial pointed out that the next five years before the
next CPC national congress to be held in 2002 are curcial for
China.
</P>
<P>
The editorial believed that the newly elected Central
Committee, which includes a large number of young officials who
have both ability and political integrity, constitutes a personnel
guarantee for the development and stability of China.
</P>
<P>
The Wen Wei Po editorial said that the congress, the first one
after the smooth return of Hong Kong to the motherland on July 1,
will have a positive impact on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The spirit of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from
facts and the development blueprint drafted by the congress are
very important for the sustained prosperity and stability of Hong
Kong in the future, the editorial added.
</P>
<P>
The Ta Kung Pao highlighted in its editorial the importance of
the new CPC leadership, which serves as a link between the past
and the future.
</P>
<P>
The editorial said that nearly half of the newly elected
Central Committee members are new faces. They are young and full
of vigor and vitality, and have professional education.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people of all ethnic groups including the Hong Kong
people are encouraged by the fruitful results of the congress and
will meet the opportunities and challenges in the next century
with full confidence, the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
The editorial of the Hong Kong Commercial Daily said that the
15th CPC congress, which was convened at a crucial moment in
China's reform and modernization drive, will have a great impact
on meeting the targets for this century and striving for the
prosperity targets for the next century.
</P>
<P>
History will prove that under the banner of the Deng Xiaoping
Theory, the reform and modernization drive will be further
developed, China will surely become prosperous and strong and the
ideal of invigorating the Chinese nation will be eventually
realized.
</P>
<P>
Most Hong Kong newspapers believed that the Communist Party of
China, holding high the banner of the Deng Xiaoping Theory, will
certainly seize the opportunity and lead all China's nationalities
in successfully pushing forward the modernization drive into the
21st century.

<HEADLINE> ACP States to Map out Plans Against EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The African, Caribbean and
Pacific (ACP) group of countries will negotiate the new Lome-type
arrangements to protect the interests of the people and not be
"split" by Europe through their approaches to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Caribbean chief negotiator Shridath Ramphal made the statement
at the Commonwealth Trade Union Council and Southern Africa Trade
Union Coordinating Council Workshop in Harare Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ramphal said Southern African Development Community (SADC)
should positively identify new Lome-type arrangements between the
EU and the ACP group of countries which had the most structured
example of north/south economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ACP would not be impressed by arguments which sacrifice
the interests of the business community on false promises.
</P>
<P>
The ACP would also aim at sustaining democracies.
</P>
<P>
Ramphal said ACP had every reason to design arrangements that
will help small states in redressing inequality by developed
countries of the north and west like the banana protocol which
barred ACP states from exporting the product to the European
market.
</P>
<P>
The ACP did not want a future dominated by a culture of
preferences so it was the developing countries' right to seek
trade assistance from the developed states to help them access
their market.
</P>
<P>
"The holding of the Lome negotiations summit in November
should be a warning to the EU. We will look at how best the rest
of Lome must be strengthened, improved, the new approaches to
take and arrangements that would enhance this unique partnership
between almost half the world's countries -- more than half the
membership of the world trade organization," Ramphal said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A weaker Australian dollar
helped push Australia's wool price even higher this week, the
Australian council of Wool Exporters said today.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator jumped 13 US cents to close at 511
US cents a clean kg and the western market indicator rose 8.6 US
cents from the previous Fremantle sale a fortnight ago to finish
at 468 US cents.
</P>
<P>
A total of 93,894 bales was offered, with a pass-in rate of 5.6
percent, the council said in its weekly wool market review, which
noted strong demand for better quality wool.
</P>
<P>
Although Chinese inquiries were constant, many exporters
remained wary in the light of outstanding contractual commitments,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The council said exporters expected the market to continue to
show some volatility around a 700 Australian cent (504 US cents)
clean kg eastern market indicator.
</P>
<P>
"But there are increasing concerns being expressed about both
the quantity and quality of wool coming onto the market in the

PHNOM PENH, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen said today that the delegation from the Kingdom of
Cambodia should naturally get permission to attend the 52nd
General Assembly of the United Nations in New York.
</P>

He said the First Prime Minister Ung Huot and he will lead a

<HEADLINE> Debt Relief Effort for Uganda to Complete Next April, World Bank Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
expected that the debt relief plan for Uganda will be accomplished
in April 1998, two years ahead of previous schedule.
</P>
<P>
The Bank said in its 1997 annual report released here today
that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have
both agreed to shorten the normal three-year interim period of the
plan to one year.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and the World Bank approved last April assistance under
the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) debt initiative for
Uganda, which was the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
Under this decision, debt relief to Uganda will total about 340
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC debt initiative was endorsed by the Interim and
Development Committees of the IMF and World Bank a year ago, in
order to ensure that heavily indebted poor countries that have a
sound track record of economic adjustment can attain a sustainable
debt situation over the medium term.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank annual report said that Uganda has had
"exceptional record of sustained and strong adjustment and
reform", and the IMF and World Bank will continue to support
Uganda's effort in economic reforms and social development.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the World Bank and IMF have prepared
debt-sustainability analysis for other countries that are
approaching the decision point on the basis of their record of
performance.
</P>
<P>
It estimated that total costs of the HIPC debt initiative are
in the range of 5.5 billion U.S. dollars to 8.4 billion
U.S. dollars in net present value terms.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Loan Commitments Down in Fiscal 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Commitments by the International Bank of Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) amounted to 14.5 billion U.S. dollars, while
the International Development Association (IDA) credits totaled
3,260 million special drawing rights or 4,622 million U.S. dollars
equivalent. Both IBRD and IDA are members of the World Bank group.
</P>
<P>
A total of 141 loans to 52 member countries were approved by
the Bank's Executive Board while the 100 IDA credits went to 50
countries.
</P>
<P>
The biggest increase in commitments was in the Europe and
Central Asia region, where 67 projects were approved for a total
of 5,055 million U.S. dollars. Comparable figures for the previous
year were 61 projects for 4,395 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The sharpest drop occurred in the Africa region. The decrease
was largely explained by greater selectivity in lending, the
accelerated move by the Bank out of failed investment models, and
the slow uptake of new strategies focused on decentralized
implementation.
</P>
<P>
Adjustment lending amounted to 5,086 million U.S. dollars or
26.5 percent of bank commitments, up from the previous year's 21
percent.
</P>
<P>
The three largest borrowers from the IBRD were China (2,490
million U.S. dollars), Russia (1,716 million U.S. dollars), and
Argentina (1,480 million U.S. dollars). The three largest
borrowers of IDA credits were India (903 million U.S. dollars),
Vietnam (349.2 million U.S. dollars), and China (325 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Lending for transportation -- at 3,692 million U.S. dollars --
led all sectors by volume, followed by agriculture at 3,547
million U.S. dollars and lending for multisector purposes at 2,187
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1997, three World Bank guarantees, totaling 420
million U.S. dollars, were approved by the Executive Board.
</P>
<P>
Gross disbursements by the IBRD to countries totaled 14 billion
U.S. dollars, an increase of 626 million U.S. dollars over fiscal
1996's 13.37 billion U.S. dollars. IDA disbursements amounted to
5,979 million U.S. dollars, up 95 million U.S. dollars from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The increase in disbursements for both IBRD and IDA was
particularly noteworthy in the Europe and Central Asia region, the
Bank's annual report said.

<HEADLINE> WB Chief Calls for Transparency in Thai Bank Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James
Wolfensohn today called on the Thai banking industry to increase
transparency in their operation and strengthen competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn told a press conference here today that an early
implementation of reform measures is vital to Thai banks to
survive the current currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Although such a process will take some time, he said, "I'd like
to see Thai (banks) move quickly in that direction."
</P>
<P>
While reform of the banking institutions and banking system is
essential, the Thai authorities should also strive to expand the
capacity of supervision over the industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the World Bank has provided 2.5 million U.S.
dollars of funds for the Thai authorities to set up a research and
consultation body for the reform of the banking system.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn believed that the solution to the financial crisis
in Thailand comes with gathering of emergency funds and protection
of market confidence.
</P>
<P>
But more importantly, banks need to improve their
competitiveness for long-term development, he said.
</P>
<P>
He took the high dependence of the Thai economy on excessive
capital inflow to blame for the currency crisis, describing it as
inadequate that Thai financial markets have largely been driven by
foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
For a sound economic growth, "you have to get money from
savings and domestic market," he said.

economic growth, and the living standard of its people has
improved greatly, he said.
</P>
<P>
All these facts irrefutably testify to the success of the
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
initiated by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, he added.
</P>
<P>
Enkhtubshin noted that through the Congress, China has
reaffirmed its commitment to further reforms, especially in
state-owned enterprises, which will guarantee the country's
continued prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The secretary also praised the friendly relations between the
two parties, and said the development of good relations is not
only in the interest of the two parties, but also of the two
countries and their peoples.

<HEADLINE> Drought to Cut Tanzanian Coffee Production by 40 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Drought will force a
40 percent reduction in Tanzania's coffee production for 1997/98
(October/September) although the deficit will be partially offset
by high yields from new coffee growing areas.
</P>
<P>
This was said by Frederick Mpangile, acting managing director
of Tanzania Coffee Board in the northern Tanzanian coffee town of
Moshi.
</P>
<P>
The local press today quoted Mpangile as saying, "We expect a
40 percent decline in total production due to drought."
</P>
<P>
"But we are expecting coffee from other parts of the country
where planting has been ongoing for the past three or four years,
especially Iringa and Mbeya where traditionally we don't get any
coffee," Mpangila added, "this will help us make up the loss."
</P>
<P>
Coffee is Tanzania's key cash crop and its main agricultural
income earner. Drought caused by the failure of short rains last
November and inadequate rainfall this year have ravaged the
northern Arabica-growing area around Kilimanjaro.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM: Health Delivery Should Benefit All </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Health delivery
systems in developing countries should be community-based to
ensure maximum benefit to the majority of the people, visiting
Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral has said.
</P>
<P>
Gujral made the remarks while inaugurating a medical college
block of the International Medical and Technological University
in Dar es Salaam Thursday after his arrival for a three-day visit
to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He noted that medical education in developing countries was
often fashioned on the European model, saying, "In the process we
have tended to ignore our own highly distinctive curative
traditions, neglected our villages and distorted our social
perspective."
</P>
<P>
The health delivery system should, therefore, put emphasis on
cleanliness and physical fitness with closer integration of the
curative and preventive medicine, said the Indian Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of education in enhancing national
development, Gujral said that a nation's progress is measured not
merely by its Gross National Product (GNP), but also by the
health and literacy rates of its population as education is the
most potent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) will delay its free trade links with
Australia and New Zealand due to the economic slump affecting
ASEAN members, a senior Thai official said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN officials agreed in principle to strengthen the free
trade links with Australia and New Zealand held in Singapore early
this month, but no timeframe has been set for combining the two
countries with the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), said Karun
Kittisataporn, director-general of the Commerce Ministry's
business economics department.
</P>
<P>
Australia and New Zealand hoped to combine them with the AFTA
and they also hoped to have regular meetings with ASEAN, Karun was
quoted as saying by local newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN economic ministers would adopt a common position on the
proposal when they will meet early next month in Kuala Lumpur, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Australia and New Zealand reportedly wanted regular talks with
ASEAN members on anti-dumping and countervailing duty matters.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Accepts Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Burundi military
regime has unconditionally decided to take up the invitation to
send a delegation to the stalled peace talks on the country's
ethnic conflict, according to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
"Loyal to its ideal of leading the country to peace through
dialogue and negotiations, the government of the Republic of
Burundi will respond to the next invitation to the peace talks,"
said a message from the Burundi government sent to heads of state
of the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
It has no longer opposed participation in the talks while the
venue remains in Tanzania or under the same mediator, former
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, the message confirmed.
</P>
<P>
However, the message urged that the talks mediator Nyerere
obtain assistance from experts and diplomatic personalities with
knowledge in conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
Major Pierre Buyoya, leader of the Burundi military regime,
also pleaded with the regional leaders to move towards the total
lifting of the sanctions imposed on Burundi, saying the measures
are causing untold suffering on the most vulnerable people in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, leaders of the Great Lake regions had a
summit conference to urge the Burundi military region to join in
talks for the realization of peace in that central African
nation. The invitation, however, had been rejected for various
allegations.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi political crisis which was triggered by the
assassination of the country's first elected President Melchior
Ndadaye in 1993 reached a new turn in July 1996 following a
military coup that brought Major Pierre Buyoya to power after
toppling a civilian government of President Sylvester
Ntibantunganya.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Set Up 1st Private Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The first private-run power
plant will be set up in Bangladesh, independent United News of
Bangladesh (UNB) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The contract on setting up the private power plant in Dhaka,
capital of the country, was signed here Thursday between the Rural
Power Company Ltd. (RPC) and a consortium of Mitsui Engineering
and Shipbuilding Co. of Japan and European Gas Turbine of France.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, a 60-megawatt gas turbine power
station in Mymensingh, 193 Kilometers from Dhaka, will be built at
the cost of about 2 billion taka (about 45.45 million U.S.
dollars), the UNB said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide 70 percent of the
cost with a loan at an interest rate of 8 percent, under a
condition that the plant be operated with the private sector power
generation concept.
</P>
<P>
The power plant is expected to go into commercial operation
within 18.5 months after the signing of the contract, hopefully in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The RPC, formed as a public limited company in 1984, is a pilot
project of the Bangladeshi government to generate power in the
private sector, the UNB added.

<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Li Lanqing, a noted foreign
trade expert, today was promoted from a member of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) to a member of its Standing Committee at the First Plenary
Session of the 15th Party Central Committee here.
</P>
<P>
Li served as vice minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation and deputy secretary of its Leading Party Group,
minister and secretary of its Leading Party Group between 1986 and
1993.
</P>
<P>
After 1993, Li was a vice premier of the State Council in
charge of international and domestic trade, education and other
work. His bold pioneering spirit, sure and steady work style,
large-mindedness and remarkable achievements in these areas won
wide acclaim inside and outside the Party.
</P>
<P>
Li Lanqing was born in 1932 in Zhenjiang City in east China's
Jiangsu Province. He graduated from Shanghai's Fudan University in
1952 and joined the CPC in the same year.
</P>
<P>
During 1956-57, he worked as a trainee at Moscow's Liharchev
and Gorky Automotive Works in the then Soviet Union. Sources close
to Li said that he was an open-minded, pragmatic and enterprising
official with a deep technical background. After his return, he
worked in the First Auto Works in Changchun, northeast China, as
chief of its planning section.
</P>
<P>
He then worked in the State Economic Commission first as a
secretary to the minister and then as a section chief.
</P>
<P>
Later he successively served as deputy chief of the Planning
Division and first secretary of the Party Committee of the Engine
Plant of the Second Auto Works in Hubei Province; deputy commander

</P>
<P>
Li is seen as having a quick mind, broad visions, and strong
abilities of leadership and macro-policy decision making.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Li worked as MOFERT minister and soon created a new
situation in China's foreign trade. After taking office as
vice-minister, Li remained active in formulating and implementing
China's foreign trade policy, in particular in such fields as
restructuring the foreign trade system and utilizing overseas
capital. The fruitful work of MOFERT ensured a steady and rapid
growth of China's foreign trade. The utilization of overseas
capital also registered notable progress, making the country one
of the largest utilizers of overseas capital among developing
economies.
</P>
<P>
Li Lanqing has attended many government-level trade
negotiations in recent years, and also a key member often
appearing in the key state activities or state visits by the
Chinese leaders to foreign countries. His ability to cope with
thorny problems and sense of humor earned him a good name from
people of various circles.
</P>
<P>
Li is also one of the key figures who initiated the state
policy of "developing China by relying on science and technology."
He won praise from intellectuals for his efforts to reform China's
education system, increase education funds and seek solutions to
such problems as salaries of teachers.
</P>
<P>
Early in the 1950s when he worked in the First Auto Works, Li
learned English by himself. While receiving training in Moscow, Li
learned to speak Russian. His hobbies include calligraphy,

KUALA LUMPUR, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
today declared a state of emergency in Sarawak, an East Malaysian

</P>
<P>
The declaration was made by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, who is also the National Operations Director, Malaysia's

Malaysian API readings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sarawak state Chief Minister Abdul Taib Mahmud was
quoted as saying that all factories were directed to stop
operations to prevent excessive smoke emission while the movement
of vehicles must be restricted.
</P>
<P>
He said action would be taken against anyone carrying out open
burning without any warning.
</P>
<P>
The chief minister ordered that "outdoor activities must be
stopped and masks must be worn if the situation warrants it to
avoid health implications."
</P>
<P>
He said that public and private sector employees would be given
"unrecorded leave" if necessary, except staff whose services were
essential.

JAKARTA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
ASEAN Nations (ASEAN) Thursday called on the developed countries
to abide by the U.N. Convention on Global Climatic Change and to
meet their target and formulation.
</P>
<P>
At the conclusion of the two-day 7th ASEAN ministerial meeting
on the environment held here, Indonesian State Minister for
Environment Sarwono Kusumaatmadja said the developed countries
should be united on climate change and show an example.
</P>
<P>
There was no consistent view among the developed countries, he
said, adding that it seemed they tried to shrug off their
commitment.
</P>
<P>
"They should not impose all the responsibilities on the
developing countries to stabilize global climate," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
He added that pollution caused by the developed world has been
more worldwide and toxic, and could only be detected by skillful
scientists.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, ministers from nine ASEAN member countries
approved a 12-point Jakarta declaration on environment and
development.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, the ministers endorsed a framework to
achieve ASEAN's long-term environmental goals for maintaining the
quality of ambient air and river waters.
</P>
<P>
They also adopted three flagship projects for action -- the
ASEAN environment year 2000, ASEAN environment awards and the
ASEAN regional center for bio-diversity conservation.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN ministers also held an informal discussion on global
environmental issues with their four dialogue partners --
Australia, Japan, Canada and the Jakarta-based United Nations
Development Program, sources at the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
Sarwono said pollution in the developing countries had caused
global warming, ozone depletion, rise in sea level which cannot be
readily detected.
</P>
<P>
"Let's be better resource managers, efficient in the use of
energy and ASEAN should concentrate on these climate issues," he
said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The 8th ASEAN ministerial meeting on the environment will be
held in Malaysia in 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, who was just
re-elected general-secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) this morning, said that he is fully
confident of China's future.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remark during a meeting between members of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the new CPC Central
Committee, who were elected this morning at the First Plenum of
the 15th CPC Central Committee, and several hundred Chinese and
foreign journalists in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
"At the turn of the century, facing unprecedented challenges
and opportunities, we are full of confidence in realizing the
country's magnificent objectives for the next century," Jiang told
the journalists.
</P>
<P>
"Although many difficulties may still lie ahead as we press
forward, so long as we hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory, unswervingly adhere to the Party's basic line, and work
hard together under the guidance of the basic line, principles and
policies adopted at the 15th National Party Congress, we are sure
to achieve the goal of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that China will have a better future, and we also
wish the world a better future," he added.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Party Congratulates CPC on Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of the Mongolian
People's Revolutionary Party U. Enkhtubshin congratulated the
Communist Party of China (CPC) on its 15th National Congress, and
said he believes there will be a more prosperous China in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Enkhtubshin said the Congress
has set the development strategy for China, and the country will
accomplish greater achievements in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his two visits to China in the early 1990s,
Enkhtubshin praised China's political and economic achievements,
since the inception of its reform and opening up policy.
</P>
<P>
China has enjoyed a stable political environment and fast
economic growth, and the living standard of its people has
improved greatly, he said.
</P>
<P>
All these facts irrefutably testify to the success of the
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
initiated by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, he added.
</P>
<P>
Enkhtubshin noted that through the Congress, China has
reaffirmed its commitment to further reforms, especially in
state-owned enterprises, which will guarantee the country's
continued prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The secretary also praised the friendly relations between the
two parties, and said the development of good relations is not
only in the interest of the two parties, but also of the two
countries and their peoples.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Ex-Leader Released from House Arrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's former state and
Communist party leader Todor Zhivkov was released from house
arrest today, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
Zhivkov was personally informed of the decision by an official
of the military prosecutor's office who said he can now, after
reporting to prosecutors, move freely about, but not leave the
country, Zhivkov's family said.
</P>
<P>
A military prosecutor and lawyer, Daniela Dokovska, told him
that since the case involving him had not been closed, Zhivkov
still had to report regularly to the police, the Bulgarian
Telegraph Agency (BTA) quoted his family as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zhivkov, 86, was placed under house arrest in 1989 in the
"regeneration process" case. He was accused of involvement in
forcing ethnic Turks in the country to change their names in
1984-85.
</P>
<P>
Other defendants in the case include former Prime Minister
Georgi Atanassov and former Interior Minister Dimiter Stoyanov.
</P>
<P>
Zhivkov told the BTA over the phone that the move was a step in
the right direction by the Bulgarian justice department.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Wei Jianxing, Standing Committee Member of CPC Politburo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, 66, was elected
member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) at the
First Plenum of the 15th Party Central Committee held here today.
</P>
<P>
Wei was a member of the Political Bureau of the 14th CPC
Central Committee and secretary of the CPC Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection. Discipline inspection has been the focus of
his work over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
After taking the helm of the CPC Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection, Wei put forward a new principle for
discipline inspection: to make education the base, the legal
system the guarantee, and supervision the key.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of the principle, the anti-corruption
efforts have yielded fruitful results for the present stage. The
uncovering of a number of major cases, including that of Chen
Xitong, a former member of the CPC Politburo, has widely been
acclaimed by the general public.
</P>
<P>
Born in January 1931 in Xinchang County of east China's
Zhejiang Province, Wei joined the Party in March of 1949.
Graduated from the Dalian Engineering Institute in northeast
China's Liaoning Province, he has acquired the technical title of
senior engineer.
</P>
<P>
From 1949 to 1952, he studied at the Machine-Building
Department of the Dalian Engineering Institute.
</P>
<P>
Between 1952 and 1953, he studied Russian at a training class
in Fushun City sponsored by the Nonferrous Metal Administration
under the Northeastern China Industrial Department. From 1953 to
1955, he went to learn business management in the then Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
From 1955 to 1966, he worked in the Northeast Light Alloys
Processing Factory, where he served as a standing committee member
of the factory Party Committee. Between 1966 and 1970 he fell
victim of the "Cultural Revolution", stripped of all his posts and
forced to work in factory workshops.
</P>
<P>
From 1970 to 1980 his leading position in the factory was
restored, serving successively as head of the production division,
vice chairman of the factory Revolutionary Committee, standing
committee member of the factory Party Committee, deputy secretary
of the factory Party Committee, and director and Party secretary
of the factory.
</P>
<P>
Between 1980 and 1981, he studied in a training class for young
and middle-aged cadres at the Party School of the CPC Central
Committee, and served as deputy secretary of the Municipal Party
Committee and mayor of Harbin City in Heilongjiang Province from
1981 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
Between 1983 and 1984, he was vice president, member of
secretariat and deputy secretary of the leading Party group of the
All-China Federation of Trade Unions. From 1984 to 1985, he served
as deputy head of the Organization Department of the CPC Central
Committee; from 1985 to 1987, he became head of the Department.
From 1987 to 1992, he served as Minister of Supervision and
secretary of the leading Party group in the Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 1993, Wei also served concurrently as president
of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Under his leadership,
trade unions at all levels across the country have unswervingly
carried out the Party's basic principle of relying whole-heartedly
on the working class, and have played a more active role in
safeguarding the workers' rights and interests, thus giving full
scope to the workers' initiative and creativity.
</P>
<P>
When the corruption case of Chen Xitong was exposed in 1995,
Wei was appointed secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party
Committee. He made a lot of investigations in the grassroots and
took a series of resolute actions, quickly restoring the city's
work to its original vigor and vitality. While being a member of
the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee since 1992, Wei
also served as a member of the Secretariat of the Party Central
Committee. He was also an alternate member and member of the 12th
CPC Central Committee and member of the 13th and 14th CPC central
committees.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Campaign Finance Bill Near for Senate Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Supporters of a bipartisan
legislation to overhaul campaign finance conducted intense
negotiations with Senate Republican leaders Thursday in an effort
to bring a modified bill to the floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
One chief sponsor, Republican Senator John McCain, said
agreement could be reached Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear when the bill is likely to be called up, though
negotiators from both sides said it might occur in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
McCain said he believed that agreement could probably be
reached tomorrow morning but "that is also up to" Senate
Republican leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
"We're talking," Lott was quoted as saying by the Associated
Press. "I just met with the leadership and we have modifications
we're working on."
</P>
<P>
Senate Democrats, who have been pressing for congressional
debate this year on changing a system dominated by the chase for
big contributions. Last week Democrats circulated a letter signed
by all 45 Democratic senators expressing support for a bill
co-sponsored by McCain and Sen. Russ Feingold, Democrat from
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
Lott and other Republican leaders have been insisting that any
consideration of fund-raising reform should wait until after the
Governmental Affairs Committee completes its hearings, though Lott
softened that stance last week. The panel has focused on possible
Democratic fund-raising violations during the 1996 presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The McCain-Feingold bill would ban "soft money," the
unrestricted contributions going to political parties, and offer
other incentives for politicians to curb their campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
McCain said a new version under discussion with Republican
leaders would also let union members demand a refund of the
portion of their dues used for political activity, a provision
Lott has insisted on.
</P>
<P>
To lessen the advantage of wealthy candidates, the legislation
would limit aid from political parties to Senate hopefuls who
spend more than 50,000 dollars of their own money on their
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
In the House of Representatives, where Republican leaders also
oppose immediate action on fund-raising overhaul, Democrats are
using delaying tactics in protest.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Political Uncertainty Arising in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Political uncertainty is
arising from Charter change moves seeking to allow Philippine
President Fidel Ramos to run again and it is taking toll on the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The peso and share prices each fell three percent in Thursday's
trading on fears of political jitters. The peso breached a new
record low of 34.05 pesos to one U.S. dollar for the first time as
the stock prices slid 64.11 points to close at 2,009.85 points.
</P>
<P>
The peso more or less followed the turbulence of other
currencies in the region, but political situation played a more
important role in the meltdown of the peso, Philippine Central
Bank governor Gabriel Singson said.
</P>
<P>
Singson was referring to a massive protest rally to be held
across the country on September 21. The rally was called by former
President Corazon Aquino and the Roman Catholic Church headed by
Cardinal Jaime Sin.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that one million people would attend the
nationwide rally to voice their anger over Charter change moves
and the extension of the term of President Ramos.
</P>
<P>
After ousting dictator Ferdinand Marcos who ruled the country
for 20 years, the Filipinos approved in 1987 the current
Constitution that allows President Ramos to serve only a single
term of six years.
</P>
<P>
However, his followers, citing that Ramos' quitting would spoil
the country's momentum of economic growth, tried all means to
perpetuate Ramos in power in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
This year Ramos' supporters went in full swing in lifting his
term limit. A pro-Charter change group called "The People's
Initiative for Reform, Modernization and Action" (PIRMA) filed two
petitions to the Supreme Court and another one to the Commission
on Elections, calling for a plebiscite to extend Ramos' term.
</P>
<P>
After the PIRMA failed, Ramos' supporters took the second round
of offensives. Lawmakers of the Ruling Lakas-NUCD in the Lower
House of Congress filed a bill aimed at converting Congress into a
constituent assembly to change the Charter. In the
opposition-dominated Senate, a legislator echoed and also filed a
bill for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos has often repeated that he would step down in
June next year. But after the Charter change moves intensified, he
changed his tune and said it was "the citizen's right" to change
the Charter.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the Southeast Asian financial turmoil starting
in Thailand quickly spilled over to the Philippines. Amid the
currency meltdown, the peso has devaluated by 28 percent as the
stock prices tumbled by more than 700 points.
</P>
<P>
Another piece of bad news followed. In the first half of the
year, the country's economy slowed down to 5.9 percent from last
year's 7.5 percent, due to the poor performance of industry,
agriculture and the income from overseas Filipino workers.
</P>
<P>
The business community complained in a letter to the President
that the reason behind the economic slowdown was the Ramos
administration talked too much about Charter changes instead of
economic development.
</P>
<P>
But the businessmen were further stunned when Ramos told them
that he may opt to stay in power if the Charter is changed. Angry
enough, the businessmen decided to hold back their support to
Ramos and join other sectors in the Sept. 21 anti-Charter change
rally.
</P>
<P>
A spate of bomb threats has haunted Metro Manila since early
this month after two blasts killed six people and wounded 66
others. The opposition accused that the threats were made by
Ramos' supporters who wish to give Ramos a chance to declare
martial law by sending the country into chaos.
</P>
<P>
There are also reports that the planned rally would be bombed.
To prepared "for the worst", the government has created a special
task force and mobilized navy boats, Air Force helicopters and
6,000 policemen to guard the rally.
</P>
<P>
Amid fears that the political situation might become unstable,
some foreign investors have pulled their funds out of the country,
fueling the currency woes and hurting the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos still keeps everyone guessing whether he would
stay in power or not next year. Analysts wish the mass rally to be
held smoothly, saying the occurrence of an explosion would signal
that the country's political situation is really becoming
unstable.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Tombstones Destroyed in Berlin Cemetery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-Eight tombstones were
either overturned or destroyed in a Jewish cemetery over the
nights of September 17 and 18.
</P>
<P>
Andreas Nahan, chairman of the Jewish communities in Berlin,
speculated that this was done by Neo-Nazis. He hoped police can
find out and punish the perpetrators as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Built in 1827, the cemetery is the burial ground for about
20,000 Jews, including Jewish leader Gerson von Bleichroeder,
publisher Leopold Ullstein and musician Jacob Liebermann.
</P>
<P>
Neo-Nazis and anti-Jewish organizations have frequented the
cemetery ever since the 1970s. In 1984 alone, 200 tombstones were
destroyed by Neo-Nazis.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, 68, was re-elected
into the top policy-decision making body -- the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) at the First Plenary Session of the
15th CPC Central Committee here today. It is also the third time
in succession for Li to be elected into the innermost circle of
CPC's third generation of collective leadership since 1987.
</P>
<P>
China has made tremendous achievements in reform and opening up
to the outside world over the past decade since the 13th CPC
National Congress, to which Li Peng as Premier of the People's
Republic of China and the central government led by him have made
remarkable contributions.
</P>
<P>
Li, the son of a revolutionary martyr, acquired his higher
education in the former Soviet Union. Known as an electricity
specialist, Li Peng is one of those high-ranking officials with a
technical background in New China.
</P>
<P>
Li was born in October, 1928 in southwest China's Sichuan
Province. He joined the CPC in November 1945 and started his
career in March 1941.
</P>
<P>
Li studied at the Yan'an Institute of Natural Sciences, Yan'an
Middle School and Zhangjiakou Vocational School of Industry
between 1941 and 1946.
</P>
<P>
Then he served as a technician in the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Power
Company and an assistant manager and a party branch secretary at
the Harbin Greese Company.
</P>
<P>
In 1948, one year before the founding of New China, he was sent
to study at the Moscow Power Institute, majoring in hydroelectric
engineering. During the period he was chairman of the Chinese
Students Association in the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
After returning home in 1955, Li served as a deputy director
and chief engineer of the Fengman Hydroelectric Power Plant in
northeast China. Later he served as deputy chief engineer of the
Northeast China Power Administration and director of its
Electricity Dispatch Department, director of the Fuxin Power Plant
and deputy secretary of the plant's Party committee.
</P>
<P>
Between 1966 and 1976, he held the posts as an acting secretary
of the Party Committee of the Beijing Power Supply Bureau,
chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Bureau, deputy
secretary of the Party Committee of Beijing Power Administration,
chairman of the Revolutionary Committee and director of the
Administration and secretary of the Party group of the
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Between 1979 and 1983, he served as vice-minister and minister
of Power Industry and secretary of the Party Group of the Ministry
of Power Industry, and vice-minister and deputy secretary of the
Party group of the Ministry of Water Resources and Power.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng was elected member of the CPC Central Committee at the
12th CPC National Congress in 1982 and was co-opted member of the
Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee at the Fifth Plenary Session of the 12th Central
Committee in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1983, Li Peng served as vice-premier of the State
Council, took charge of energy, communications and raw materials
departments. Beginning in 1985, he served concurrently as minister
in charge of the State Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
Li was elected member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee at the First Plenary
Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee in November 1987 and in
the same month he was appointed acting Premier of the State
Council. Five months later, that is, at the First Session of
the Seventh National People's Congress, Li was appointed Premier
of the State Council, the fourth premier in the history of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Li was re-elected member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee at the First Plenary
Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee in October, 1992, and
one year later was re-appointed premier at the First Session of
the Eighth NPC. Between 1988 and 1990, he served concurrently as
Minister of the State Commission for Economic Restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade since Li Peng became the Premier, China's
national economy has maintained a healthy development momentum,
with steady progress in economic restructuring, and fruitful
results in opening up to the outside world and particularly in
building the socialist market economy. Meanwhile, China's
exchanges and cooperation with foreign countries have greatly been
enhanced. Li has made quite a number of visits to foreign
countries, contributing to the consolidation and development of
friendship and cooperation between China and other countries.
</P>
<P>
As the Premier of the People's Republic, Li Peng has always
kept a tight schedule. Over the past decade, Li often went down to
grassroots units across the country to do investigations and
study. Over the past decade as Premier, he made inspection on
study tours almost all over the country. Apart from paying
attention to major political and economic situation in various
places, he has been very much concerned about four figures --
workers' average income, farmers' average earnings, prices and the
supply of vegetables and other non-staple food, all closely
related to the people's daily life.
</P>
<P>
As the Premier, he has also paid much attention to the
socialist culture and ethics, which he construed as promoting
ideological and ethical progress and progress in education,
science and culture. Li showed particular concern for the work and
life of the intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to him, Li is kind, amiable, easy of
approach and good at making friends. Among his acquaintances are
common folks as well as political personalities, experts and
scholars. Li is well-versed in Russian and has learned English all
by himself. He also loves reading.
</P>
<P>
At home, Li is a "model husband." Newspapers once published a
photo showing Li Peng mending his overcoat. He said that he
learned sewing in Yan'an in the 1940s when he lived together with
children of many other revolutionary martyrs. "Li Peng has not the
slightest traces of male chauvinism," said Zhu Lin, his wife.
"Whenever he is free, he would lend a helping hand in household
chores either when he was an ordinary official or later a minister
or even after he became the Premier."
</P>
<P>
Li Peng's father, Li Shuoxun, was one of the earliest CPC
members. He was murdered in Hainan Island by the Kuomintang when
Li Peng was only three years old.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng's mother, Zhao Juntao, used to be an educator and also
one of the early CPC members. She passed away in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng has a family of 11. His wife graduated from the
Harbin Foreign Languages Institute and worked in the power
departments for many years. The couple has two sons and one
daughter.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Philippines at Crossroads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- After enjoying years of
political stability and economic growth, the Philippines now seems
to be at the crossroads, both politically and economically.
</P>
<P>
Partly because of investors' anxiety over a mass protest rally
scheduled to be held on Sunday in Manila, the Philippine peso fell
to its record low of 34.05 pesos to the U.S. dollar at the foreign
exchange market Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rally, organized by opposition parties and some church
leaders to protest against charter change drives to enable
President Fidel Ramos' re-election, is expected to draw more than
a million people together.
</P>
<P>
Government and military officials have repeatedly warned of
possible attacks by extremists, or clashes between charter change
campaigners and protesters at the rally.
</P>
<P>
During the past two months, the Philippines has been in the
grip of a currency crisis and a political crisis, characterized by
the tumble of the peso, bomb explosions, bomb hoaxes and rumors of
a martial law.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the early July decision by the Thai monetary
authorities to let the baht float, speculative attacks have forced
the peso to fall continuously to its new record low levels.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the currency fell by a considerable 1.045 pesos to
average at 33.852 against the dollar from 32.807 the other day. It
hit an all-time low of 34.05 pesos against the dollar during the
day's trading.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the peso, now 28.2 percent weaker against the
dollar from its pre-depreciation level of 26.40 to the dollar in
early July, will continue to be unstable.
</P>
<P>
Deorgracias Vistan, president of the Bankers Association of the
Philippines blamed "anxiety and the playing-it-safe attitude" over
the Sunday rally against charter changes for the peso's behavior
in recent days.
</P>
<P>
Some economists warned that the Philippine currency could fall
to 35 pesos, or even 40 pesos to the dollar, unless the government
take actions to strengthen investors' confidence, which is being
undermined by recent political uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
The continuous slide of the peso has already led to high
interest rates and an economic slowdown in the country. It is
almost certain that the government is unable to achieve its
economic growth target of 7 to 8 percent for this year.
</P>
<P>
Although the currency crisis has affected the daily life of the
Filipinos, they seem much concerned about the country's political
future now as the nation is likely to be divided by a charter
change dispute.
</P>
<P>
Under the Philippine Constitution, the president can only serve
a single six-year term and is not allowed to seek re-election. But
for the last two years, mass organizations and members of the
ruling Lakas-NUCD (National Union of Christian Democrats) have
been campaign for charter changes in order to lift the term limits
of the president and other elective officials.
</P>
<P>
The campaign has met stiff resistance of opposition parties and
some church leaders, who have vowed to keep on their protests
until President Ramos declares he will not seek re-election or
extension of his term for another three years.
</P>
<P>
Actually, Ramos hinted again and again in recent days that he
will step down next June and will endorse a presidential candidate
of his Lakas-NUCD in November according to the country's election
law.
</P>
<P>
But no members of the opposition party believed Ramos'
sincerity since the president also revealed several times that he
will keep his option open till November "in the interests of the
nation," a remark interpreted by the opposition as a signal of
seeking a second term.
</P>
<P>
While nationwide anti-charter change rallies are scheduled to
be held on Sunday in Manila, ruling party members and their
supporters are also planning pro-charter-change demonstrations in
the capital and other parts of the country on that day.
</P>
<P>
Arnulfo Acedera, chief of staff of the armed force, warned
Thursday that extremists may hit the protest rally in Manila and
the military is hard to get control of small extremist groups that
can stage lightning raids and cause mayhem in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Some newspapers in their statements in recent days called on
people to stay away from the Manila rally on Sunday to avoid
possible loss of lives.
</P>
<P>
But opposition parties say that Sunday's protest rally in
Manila is safe and about 4 million people are expected to attend
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Most Filipinos fear the massive protest may lead to bloody
conflicts or cause the deterioration of political situation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
If the government cannot act properly in the next few days, the
political crisis could bring about political instability in the
country, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is really at the crossroads now, they warned.

<HEADLINE> Party Congress is of "Extremely Great Significance," Says Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The 15th National Party
Congress, which ended here yesterday, is of "extremely great
significance", said Jiang Zemin, who was just re-elected general
secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with the press along with other six members of the
of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC
Central Committee, Jiang said the congress has completed its
agenda and came to a successful conclusion.
</P>
<P>
He called the congress "a great success", which was convened at
a time when the new century is coming and when the development of
China's reforms, opening-up and modernization drive are in a
crucial stage.
</P>
<P>
"It is of extremely great significance to have convened
such a congress that inherits the past and ushers in the future,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory has been
the soul of this congress and establishing Deng Xiaoping Theory as a
guiding ideology of the whole Party is the most important outcome
of this congress," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"This will inevitably have a major and far-reaching impact on
our efforts to attain the 'three step' strategic goals set forth
by Deng Xiaoping and build China into a prosperous, strong,
democratic and culturally advanced socialist country in the next
century," said Jiang Zemin.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Give Loan to Small, Medium Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's National
Development Bank (NDB) will provide 75 million U.S. dollars of
loan to small and medium-scale enterprises, bank sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
Of the 75 million dollars, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has
for the first time guaranteed a 50-million-dollar long term loan,
which the NDB will borrow from overseas, and provided 5 million
dollars of direct loans to the NDB.
</P>
<P>
These funds, to be disbursed over three years, will be
exclusively used to develop the small and medium enterprises,
which are considered the backbone of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Local economic analysts believe these enterprises have the best
potential to create jobs and improve the socio-economic conditions
of the country.
</P>
<P>
The funds, which are repayable in 10 years with a one-year
grace period, will be channeled through a network of Participatory
Credits Institutions nationwide.

<HEADLINE> General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin was re-elected
General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) at the
First Plenary Session of the 15th CPC Central Committee here today
following the last CPC National Congress in this century.
</P>
<P>
His re-election as head of the world's largest ruling party
with 58 million members is viewed as the measure of the
confidence of the Chinese people he enjoys.
</P>
<P>
Over the past eight years when Jiang served as the top leader
of the Party, China has been in a period featuring "most stable
political situation, the strongest national strength, the most
active diplomatic activities and the most remarkable improvement
in the people's life," said a local analyst.
</P>
<P>
Overseas press commented that the prestige of CPC's third
generation leadership is just the kind of prestige that could be
expected from a country where economy has registered double-digits
growth for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
Jiang officially took over the post of Party General Secretary
in June, 1989 when China faced great difficulties, politically,
economically and diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
In just two years, Jiang succeeded in bringing about big
changes in the situation. The GNP grew steadily at an average
annual rate of 12.1 percent, the fastest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was elected President of the People's Republic of China
in March 1993 and continued to serve for another term as Chairman
of the Central Military Commission. His status as the core of the
leadership is attributable to his outstanding achievements,
ability and a steady and down-to-earth style of work.
</P>
<P>
Born on August 17, 1926, of an intellectual family in Yangzhou,
a culturally famous city in east China's Jiangsu Province, Jiang
received his higher education in the prestigious Shanghai Jiaotong
University and his major was electrical engineering.
</P>
<P>
Both his grandfather and father were noted local scholars.
</P>
<P>
During his college years, Jiang participated in the CPC-led
students movements and joined the Communist Party of China in
1946.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of New China, Jiang served as associate
engineer, deputy director of a factory, section head of an
enterprise. In 1955, He went to the then Soviet Union and worked
in the Stalin Automobile Works as a trainee for one year. After
his return home, he served as deputy division head, deputy chief
power engineer, director of a branch factory, and deputy director,
director of factories and research institutes in Changchun,
Shanghai and Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing years, Jiang served as deputy, then director of
foreign affairs department of the No. 1 Ministry of
Machine-Building Industry. He speaks good English, Russian and
Romanian, and knows some Japanese and French.
</P>
<P>
Before he became Shanghai Mayor in 1985, Jiang served as
minister of Electronics Industry.
</P>
<P>
His unique career experiences have enabled him to observe and
solve problems from the perspectives of profound relations between
China and the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was the first planner of Shenzhen, China's first special
economic zone (SEZ). In 1979 when the late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping proposed to build SEZs in China, Jiang was the first to
settle concrete matters in Shenzhen on behalf of the central
government. He was then serving as deputy director and
concurrently secretary general of the State Import and Export
Administration and the State Foreign Investment Administration.
Facing the wilderness, Jiang put forward his guiding ideas that
had a far-reaching effect on Shenzhen's construction in the
following years. "All construction projects in the SEZ should be
started from a long-term point of view and in line with
international standards." The development of Shenzhen over the
past 10 years and more has testified to the correctness of his
ideas.
</P>
<P>
Soon after Jiang became Shanghai mayor in 1985, he planned a
series of key infrastructure projects using overseas capitals. The
city raised 3.2 billion US dollars from international capital
market, of which 1.4 billion dollars were poured into such key
projects as the city's subway, Nanpu Bridge, polluted water
treatment, airport expansion and program-controlled telephone
exchanges. People are stunned by the profound changes that have
taken place in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was elected member of the 12th CPC Central Committee in
September of 1982. In November, 1987, Jiang was elected member of
the Political Bureau at the First Plenary Session of the 13th CPC
Central Committee. He was elected member of the Standing Committee
of the Political Bureau in June of 1989 at the Fourth Plenary
Session of the 13th Central Committee, general secretary of the
CPC Central Committee. Five months later, he was elected chairman
of the CPC Central Military Commission at the Fifth Plenary
Session of the 13th Central Committee. At the Third Session of the
Seventh National People's Congress, he was elected chairman of the
Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China
(PRC). At the first Plenary Session of the 14th Central Committee,
he was re-elected member of its Central Committee, member of the
Political Bureau, member of its Standing Committee, general
secretary of CPC's Central Committee and at the Eighth National
People's Congress held in March, 1993, he was elected president of
the PRC and chairman of the Central Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
During the past eight years, what he always puts high on his
agenda is grain, cotton, edible oil and vegetable production and
supply, all closely related to the people's daily life. "Any
reform should benefit the majority of the people and it should be
carried out within the capacity of the people to bear upon," he
often said. Thanks to the implementation of these principles, the
thorny reforms of the country's public finance, taxation, monetary
and investment systems have been going on smoothly without sharp
fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
Over the past eight years, Jiang toured almost all provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities except Taiwan. What he is
concerned with most is the life of the people in poor and remote
areas where ethnic groups live. He initiated the ambitious
anti-poverty campaign in 1992, vowing to eradicate poverty before
the end of the century. Thanks to the intensified efforts, China's
population under the poverty line has been reduced from 80 million
to 58 million by 1996.
</P>
<P>
Jiang loves to make friends with intellectuals. He has many
good friends in economic, scientific, art and press circles. Some
friends called him a "scholar statesman." Early in 1987 when he
was still Shanghai mayor, he initialed a bi-monthly seminar with
scholars in the theoretical circle in Shanghai. Each time he would
raise a hot or sensitive or difficult issue for the experts and
scholars he invited to discuss.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stresses national self-esteem, self-confidence, national
dignity and the cohesion of the Chinese nation. Jiang is highly
accomplished in classic Chinese literature and often quotes
ancient poems off-hand. Jiang has a wide range of interest and
plays piano and erhu, a two-string traditional Chinese musical
instrument. In his spare time, he may indulge himself in the music
of Mozart and Beethoven. In his eyes, the Chinese and Western
cultures are "communicable."
</P>
<P>
Jiang loves reading and devotes most of his spare time to
reading the latest science books. He also loves to read Mark
Twain. Sources close to him said Jiang could recite the monologue
of "To be or not to be" in Hamlet and "Ode to the West Wind" by
Shelley. In his last official tour of Russia, his analysis of the
literary masterpieces by Leo Tolstoy and other Russian authors
surprised the Russian guides.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yeping, his wife, graduated from the Shanghai Foreign
Languages Institute and used to be head of an electrical
engineering research institute in Shanghai. Now she has retired.
The couple have two sons. Jiang Mianheng, the eldest, obtained his
doctor's degree in electronic engineering in the United States.
After returning to Shanghai, he has been appointed director of the
Shanghai Metallurgical Research Institute. Their younger son,
Jiang Miankang, studied in Germany for a while after finishing
Shanghai No. 2 University of Engineering. Now he is a researcher
of software at the Shanghai Underground Pipeline Information
System.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Cuts 153 Items of Import Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
cut import tariffs on 153 raw materials and substitution products
by five to 10 percentage points as a follow-up step to boost
exports and revive the country's economy, official sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
According to a decree issued recently by Finance Minister
Mir'ie Muhammad, the new tariff cut became effective on Wednesday,
the sources at the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 153 items, 40 items were textiles and
textile-related products, 67 wood products, 31 petrochemical
products, nine leather products and three of steel and machinery,
automotive and agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Products affected by the cut include peanuts of which tariff
was cut from 20 percent to 10 percent, tire cord from 20 percent
to 15 percent, dinatrium sulfate and acetylene from 15 percent to
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tariffs on polyester, staple fiber, rayon viscose, veneer and
processed leather were cut from 10 percent to 5 percent, while
tariffs on unwoven textile and sawn logs were reduced from 10
percent to zero, and those on soybean and soybean oil were cut
from 5 percent to zero.
</P>
<P>
The new decree also reclassified several products into the new
tariff system and changed their tariff structure. For example,
acrylic and polymer vinyl paints, of which tariffs previously
stood at 20 percent, were divided into paints for leather with 5
percent tariffs and others with 20 percent tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The cut will automatically reduce the country's weighted
average tariff level from 11.9 percent, which had been in place
since July 4, to 11.76 percent now, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Backs Global Treaty On Landmine Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has expressed
support in principle to the draft treaty adopted by some 100
countries in Oslo, Norway, on Thursday on banning the use,
production and export of anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
Yet, this position is subject to confirmation after the country
reviews the details of the final text of the treaty, today's press
reports quoted Thai foreign ministry officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government also would need parliamentary approval
before the signing of the treaty scheduled for December in Ottawa,
Canada, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from around 100 countries Thursday endorsed a
historic draft treaty to ban anti-personnel mines in Oslo, the
capital of Norway.
</P>
<P>
However, the united states reportedly did not agree on the
treaty for an immediate and total ban on anti-personnel mines.
</P>
<P>
The treaty would come into effect six months after it is
ratified by the 40th country at a ceremony on December 3 in
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy noted that the signing
ceremony will go ahead even if the United States is absent.

<HEADLINE> IMF Holds Special Seminar in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 19 (Xinhua) -- A large-sized seminar
organized by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) opened here
today with the presence of some 400 financiers, economists and
government officials from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Asia and the IMF", the seminar includes four sessions
focusing on IMF's macroeconomic policies and changing emphasis of
the Fund, and Asian economic development and challenges for
sustaining growth in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Delivering an opening speech at the seminar, Chen Yuan, deputy
governor of the People's Bank of China, said that Asia has become
the most dynamic regional economy in the world with a good record
of growth performance.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 8.2 percent output growth rate of Asia
(excluding Japan and the Middle East) in 1996 was more than double
the global rate.
</P>
<P>
"However, Asia has encountered its own difficulties in economic
development. The recent turbulence in the currency market in the
Southeast Asia is one example," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the recent events to be temporary in nature. The
Asian economy remains healthy on the whole and its prospects are
favorable," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the prosperity and stability of the Chinese
mainland has a significant bearing on Hong Kong and on Asia at
large.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy is projected to grow at an annual rate of 8
to 9 percent, and inflation to remain below 6 percent in the next
few years, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that with the hard work of the Chinese
people, the mainland macroeconomic targets for the 9th Five-Year
Plan (1996-2000) and the long-range objectives through the year
of 2010 are within reach," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, Hong Kong will become even more prosperous.
A more modernized China will be better able to contribute to the
prosperity of the Asian region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Stanley Fischer, first deputy managing director of IMF, is
expected to give a keynote speech at noon, and P.R. Narvekar,
former deputy managing director of IMF, is to give a closing
speech at the seminar.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Shooting Mars Mood of Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 19 (Xinhua) -- Albania's latest shooting
incident inside parliament is threatening to damage the mood of
reconciliation and renew political tension in the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Socialist lawmaker Gafur Mazreku shot Azem Hajdari of the
opposition Democratic Party with a pistol outside the entrance to
the parliamentary chamber just two days after they were involved
in a scuffle during a parliamentary debate on raising value-added
tax.
</P>
<P>
Both President Rexhep Meidani and Prime Minister Fatos Nano
condemned the shooting in an effort to maintain peace and prevent
repercussions, while the opposition appeared intent on using the
incident for its own ends.
</P>
<P>
"I denounce this action, which was quite primitive and has
destroyed the climate of peace and tolerance that we are trying to
build in Albania," President Meidani said.
</P>
<P>
Nano, for his part, said Mazreku acted alone and the incident
had nothing to do with the Socialist Party; he said Mazreku should
face criminal liabilities.
</P>
<P>
Interior Ministry forces, local police and special squads have
been mobilized to guard against any further eventualities.
</P>
<P>
Hajdari, 45, received wounds to his chest, shoulders and a leg,
but his condition is not life-threatening. He will be sent to
neighboring Italy for further treatment.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 Democrat supporters demonstrated Thursday in
central Tirana, brandishing Hajdari's bloodied trousers.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party's head and former President Sali Berisha
accused Meidani and Nano of instigating the shooting, a charge
denied by both.
</P>
<P>
He called for the removal of the parliament's speakers and
urged Democrats to join a fresh rally on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The shooting is seen as a serious setback to the new
government's efforts to restore order in the impoverished state
following months of violence sparked by the collapse of pyramid
investment schemes.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the incident would also mar Tirana's attempts to
win international loans.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister cancelled his trip to a meeting of the
International Monetary Fund and World Bank in Hong Kong because of
the incident.
</P>
<P>
Many believe the attempted murder is unlikely to lead to a
re-play of the large-scale demonstrations seen before, since most
Albanians are hoping for stability after months of turmoil.
</P>
<P>
However, as hundreds and thousands of firearms are still in the
hands of private citizens, the fear of instability still loom
large.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Albanian opposition lawmaker
Azem Hajdari has been airlifted to Italy for treatment of gunshot
wounds suffered in a confrontation in Tirana with a lawmaker of
the ruling Socialist Party earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The local media reported that Hajdari has been taken to Bari, a
port city in southeastern Italy, where he will be treated at the
central hospital for four gunshot wounds, including one to the
chest.
</P>
<P>
Hajdari, of the opposition Democratic Party, was shot and
seriously wounded by the rival party lawmaker, Gafur Mazreku, on
the floor of parliament two days after they exchanged blows during
a legislative session.
</P>
<P>
Mazreku has reportedly been arrested shortly after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
The shooting incident heated up tensions between the government
and the opposition after weeks of calm following elections in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Sali Berisha, the former president, blamed
the government for the shooting, which was also condemned by
Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano.
</P>
<P>
The two lawmakers had already come to blows two days ago, with
Mazreku apparently coming out the worst.
</P>
<P>
There is speculation that he might have been inspired to shoot
Hajdari by the "Kanun," the ancient code of honor of the northern
mountain region from which both the lawmaker come. The code
requires that an offense be washed in blood or become a life-long
dishonor.

SHANGHAI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- While most Chinese formerly

urban residents are currently practicing investment
diversification.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese are currently investing in various areas, including
stocks, bonds, futures, foreign currencies, insurance, real estate

</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou,
Chongqing and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the five cities preferred investments in savings,
stamps and bonds, while Chongqing residents opted for the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, however, 69.5 percent of respondents
considered savings as the most sound investment.
</P>
<P>
People investing in stocks and bonds accounted for 20 percent
of the total respondents, with those opting for insurance and
stamps accounting for 12.3 percent and 8.2 percent respectively of
total respondents.
</P>

Collecting arts and crafts, and real estate investments offers
promising areas for investors, with experts pointing to the fact
that these particular areas offer low risk and high returns and
are thus highly attractive to urban residents.

<P>
LONDON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Goalkeepers Bruce Grobbelaar
and Hans Segers were charged by English soccer authorities on
Thursday with breaking betting rules and could face life bans from
the sport.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association said the charges stemmed from the
testimony they made during the match-fixing trial in Winchester
ended on August 8 in which they were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
However, the FA said it was bringing new charges against the
two goalkeepers. And Grobbelaar and Segers had admitted to
breaches of the relevant FA rules at the criminal trials.
</P>
<P>
During the trials, the two players denied match-fixing but
admitted they were paid to forecast the results of games, a clear
breach of FA rules.
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman David Davies said the players could face
suspensions or fines. However the range of penalties isn't
specified in the rules, and he didn't rule out the possibility of
a life ban.
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, several players, including England internationals
Peter Swan and Tony Kay, were banned for life in a bribery and
betting scandal. The penalty was later reduced to seven years.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian and United States
experts have fixed the price for the basic brand of Ukrainian
steel (A-36), local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
It has paved way for an agreement on suspension of antidumping
investigation into export of Ukrainian steel to the U.S.,
according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
However, the price has not been disclosed. Prices for other
brands of steel will be agreed during negotiations later this year.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian experts said that the price set for A-36 steel will
enable the Mariupol-based Azovstal and Ilich metallurgical plants
to export their products to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have not agreed on the issue of quota, which has
previously been set at 135,000 tons annually. It must be solved
before September 24 when the agreement on suspension of
antidumping investigation is signed.
</P>
<P>
Washington started the antidumping investigation on Ukrainian
steel last year. The U.S. side imposed a 237.91 percent
preliminary antidumping duty on Ukrainian steel on July 3,
including a 99.59 percent duty on Azovstal steel and a 176.76
percent duty on Ilich steel.

SHANGHAI, September 19 (Xinhua) -- The population of Shanghai,
China's leading manufacturing center, has dropped at an annual
negative rate over the past four years, according to the Shanghai

<P>
ROME, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi today sent messages of condolences to Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl after a deadly
terrorist attack in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, three unidentified gunmen attacked a tourist bus
outside the popular Egyptian Museum in the heart of Cairo, killing
10 people, at least seven of them Germans.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the Egyptian President which was also
released by the ANSA news agency, Prodi described the attack as
"the latest ferocious act in a spiral of senseless violence which
must find an adequate response."
</P>
<P>
"In this tragic moment," he said, "in expressing my condolences
for the victims, I reiterate Italy's great appreciation for
Egypt's commitment toward peace and stability in the entire region
and against terrorism."
</P>
<P>
In the message to the German chancellor released by ANSA, Prodi
said, "I wish to express to you, on behalf of myself and the
Italian government, the most heart-felt condolences which I ask
you to extend to the families of the victims."
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack,
but police pointed their fingers at the Muslim extremists fighting
since 1992 to overthrow the government and turn Egypt into a
fundamentalist Islamic state.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, Ghana Enter Final at Under-17 World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazilians overpowered Germany
4-0 in the last moments Thursday to confront Ghana at the final of
the Under-17 World Cup, gaining the opportunity to revenge its
loss to the African powerhouse at the previous championship.
</P>
<P>
Three minutes into the match in the Suez Canal city of
Ismailia, Brazil opened the account thanks to German goalkeep
Christian Wetklo who, in an attempt to clear a ball from the net,
kicked it to Brazilian Adiel Amorim and then got a blank feedback.
</P>
<P>
Undazed by the unintentional mistake, the Germans confronted
the South Amercians in the rest of the game until the last moments.
</P>
<P>
Brazilians dazzled their opponents and the spectators by
shooting a spree of three goals in a space of five minutes before
time, in the 81st, 86th and 88th minutes.
</P>
<P>
The jobs were done by Geovanni Mauriccio, Ramos Rodrigo
Ferrugem and Ronaldo Moreira.
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Brazil a chance on Sunday to revenge its 1991
defeat in Italy and a 3-2 loss to Ghana at the 1995 U-17 World Cup
final in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
In another semi-final match played in the Egyptian city of Port
Said, defending champion Ghana survived Spain's strong offensive.
</P>
<P>
The first half saw several miraculous saves by Spanish
goalkeeper Iker Casillas and a well-crafted header by Francisco
Sousa in the 34th minute.
</P>
<P>
Ghana stepped up its attacks in the second half, with captain
Godwin Attram equalizing in the 47th minute and Owusu Afriye
adding another goal 12 minutes before the final whistle to pace
Ghana for a 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, Spain and Germany will compete for the third
place of the Under-17 championship that was kicked off in four
Egyptian cities on September 4.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Meet Indian, Pakistani Prime Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 18 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
will meet the prime ministers of India and Pakistan next Monday in
New York when he attends the U.N. General Assembly session, the
White House announced today.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is likely to express his support for the two countries'
discussions on the divided region of Kashmir when he meets Indian
Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, a White House spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman stressed that the United States would not
seek to take a role in those talks.
</P>
<P>
"We do not wish in any way to insert ourselves into the
dialogue on Kashmir, nor to be a mediator, but we are very
supportive of the fact that both sides appear to be pursuing
progress through dialogue and we want to see that continue," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
India and Pakistan ended three days of peace talks in New Delhi
today with an agreement to meet again but no sign of progress in
resolving disputes that have divided them for half a century and
sparked three wars.

<HEADLINE> Dow Goes High and Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 18 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street rose
modestly today despite a broad rally which briefly hoisted the Dow
Jones industrial average back above 8,000.
</P>
<P>
The Dow rose just 36.28 to 7,922.72 after retreating from an
early-afternoon gain of 135 points that put the blue-chip
barometer above 8,000 for the first time since Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators followed the up and down track as
bonds retreated from their earlier gains that sent interest rates
falling for the fifth consecutive session.
</P>
<P>
Before the afternoon downturn, big company measures such as the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 flirted with record highs for the first time
since early August.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq market padded Wednesday's record finish, and the
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies closed at a record high
for the fifth straight session.
</P>
<P>
The small-company dominated American Stock Exchange composite
index also set its fifth consecutive record high.
</P>
<P>
Bonds rose this morning after government reports showing that
America's trade deficit soared 24.7 percent to 10.3 billion U.S.
dollars in July.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a nearly 3-to-2
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 566.85
million shares at the closing.

<HEADLINE> Pangalos on Greek-Turkish Meeting in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 17 (Xinhua) -- Greece would bring up all the
bilateral issues at next week's New York talks between the two
foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said that the issue
was not only whether they stick to the "spirit" of the Madrid
communique on relations between the two countries but also to its
letter.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos will meet with his Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem, in
New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly
to seek ways of improving relations between the two neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
There had been no proposal for U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to participate in the meeting, he said, adding
that if there was a proposal for a tripartite meeting, they would
see if it could be useful.
</P>
<P>
As for the committees of experts, he said that the Greek
committee of experts would be sending a memorandum within the week
but that a direct meeting with the respective Turkish committee
was still up for discussion.
</P>
<P>
He said that Athens' position was that the meeting should occur
if and when it was clear what was to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
"We propose specific issues of a procedural and legal nature
which the experts should discuss. We do not however accept a
general discussion on Greek-Turkish issues, as it appears the
Turks do. That is what I will do with Mr. Cam," he said.
