COLOMBO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The General Secretary of the Sri

<HEADLINE> South Korean Folk Performances Fascinate Israeli Audience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Ceramic artists and traditional
dancers and musicians from South Korea won acclaim from the Israeli
audience with their unique skills here on Monday when the Folklore
and Art Festival From South Korea opened.
</P>
<P>
The festival, entitled "The Korean Experience", was jointly
sponsored by the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, the Embassy of the
Republic of Korea in Israel and the Israeli Foreign Ministry in a
bid to promote the Korean culture on the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, James Snyder, director of
the Israel Museum, said there has always been in Israel "a
fascination with the culture in the East."
</P>
<P>
The Korean artists performing at the festival include two
ceramists, and 19 dancers and musicians from the National Folklore
Troupe of South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The ceramists, including the 58-year-old Young-wha Bae and
the young contemporary ceramist Eun Kyung Choi, made on-the-spot
demonstrations of their extraordinary skills.
</P>
<P>
Bae, deemed a national treasure in South Korea, has practised
the traditional skill of making ceramic pots for fermenting cabbage
for more than 40 years. Choi, a former sculptor, excelled at
combining sculpture skills and her talents in ceramics.
</P>
<P>
The dancers accompanied by ethnic instruments and ancient
court music presented the audience with a good chance to gain an
unique insight into the Korean ancient culture.
</P>
<P>
The festival is scheduled to present four performances in
addition to ethnic food fairs.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Museum, considered the window to the world for
Israel, successfully hosted a Chinese lantern show last year which
drew more than 60,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Mike Goldstein from the Event Department of Israeli Museum,
told Xinhua that the Israelis are less familiar with Korean arts in
comparison with the Chinese and Japanese arts and this event is
designed to promote the Korean culture on the Holy Land, where
people tend to be more identified themselves with westerners.
</P>
<P>
"Next year, we will be doing a very important and impressive
collection of treasures from the Forbidden City in China", said
Goldstein, one of the organizers of the event. "Together with the
exhibition, we will bring performing groups from China because we
always like to combine exhibitions with performances."

<HEADLINE> Barak May Form National Unity Government: Confidants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
may try to form a national unity government with the major
opposition Likud party once he returns from the botched Camp David
summit, sources close to Barak said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The 15-day-long summit, aiming to resolve all the core issues
between Israel and the Palestinians and trying to reach at least a
framework peace agreement, collapsed at Camp David near Washington
early Tuesday due to significant differences over the fate of
Jerusalem between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Ophir Pines-Paz, Barak's One Israel coalition whip, told Israel
Radio that Barak should invite Likud to join his government, a move
to save Barak's ruling coalition from early elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Natan Sharansky, leader of the right-wing Yisrael
Ba'aliya party who had call on Barak to establish such a government
since his party resigned from Barak's coalition ahead of the Camp
David summit, repeated his appeal Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Notably, Likud Chairman Ariel Sharon also retreated from his
early stands against a national unity government, saying Tuesday
night that if Barak invites him to have some talks once the prime
minister returns, he will not reject the invitation.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Sharon had repeatedly dumped the so-called national
unity coalition plan, which would include Barak's One Israel,
Likud, Yisrael Ba'aliya, the left-wing Meretz party, Center party,
Shinui party, Am Ehad, Democratic Choice, and four small Israeli
Arabs' parties. Such a coalition would have a 62-seat majority in
Israel's 120-member Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
But Sharon said Tuesday that he did not rule out the possibility
of forming a national unity government with Barak, according to
Israel Radio reports.
</P>
<P>
If Barak fails to garner majority support in the Knesset
following the summit failure, he may be forced to call up early
elections in the worst scenario -- without an Israeli-Palestinian
agreement as his trump card in the elections.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Renews Call for Armed Struggle Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The militant Palestinian group Hamas
on Tuesday called on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to resume
armed struggle against Israel after the Camp David peace talks
ended without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and the Palestinian negotiators should declare the
failure of the entire peace process and return to resistance and
jihad (holy war), said senior Hamas official Abdel-Aziz al-
Rantissi.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Resistance Movement, or Hamas, remains opposed
to the Arab-Israeli peace process and it is also critical of
Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"I renew my request to give Hamas a five-year chance to work its
jihad and resistance. Within five years Hamas will be able to
achieve gradual liberation of all of Palestine," he said.
</P>
<P>
The militant group has been engaged in a holy war aimed at
liberating all Palestinian territories occupied by Israel in
successive Middle East wars. It has claimed responsibilities for
several deadly attacks on Israeli civilian targets during the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
The call for violence came after the Middle East peace talks at
Camp David collapsed Tuesday due to a deadlock over the future of
Jerusalem. The talks, which began on July 11, were aimed at ending
the 52-year-old conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Palestinians also marched through the streets of
Gaza City on Tuesday, calling for the return of a violent uprising
against Israel.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Military Warns Of Violence After Summit Breakdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli military leaders have
warned the breakdown of the three-way peace summit at Camp David is
likely to increase frustration among the Palestinians, which
carries the risk of violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Chief of General Staff of the Israel Defense Force (IDF) Shaul
Mofaz told Israel Radio just before the announcement of the
breakdown of the summit that violence might erupt not only in the
territories, but also in Israel's northern border, because
thousands of Palestinians live in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Violent clashes between the Palestinians and Israel can also
flare up if Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat goes ahead to declare
an independent Palestinian state in September without a peace
agreement with Israel, he added.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks of intensive talks at Camp David came to naught
Tuesday without reaching a framework agreement on final-status
issues.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the breakdown of the summit, U.S. President Bill
Clinton said the Israeli and Palestinian negotiating teams have
made significant progress on the most sensitive issues dividing
them.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem, the president said, was the most difficult problem
which caused the collapse of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference following the unsuccessful
conclusion of the summit, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak called
for unity and hope, repeating that peace talks must continue.
</P>
<P>
"We have dealt with this kind of situation in the past and we
will deal with it in the future...we must not lose hope," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that all Israeli propositions offered during
the summit will not be offered again.
</P>
<P>
He said a senior American representative will soon come to the
region to aid further talks.

<HEADLINE> Enlarged British Petroleum Unveils New Brand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- One of the major oil company
in the world, BP Amoco, has unveiled a new, unified global brand
to target a radical update of its retail sites around the world.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release available here on Tuesday from BP
Tanzania office, the move to a single brand follows a 120 billion
U.S. dollar series of mergers and acquisitions which over the past
two years have brought together the former British Petroleum,
Amoco Corporation, Atlantic Richfield and Burmah Castrol with a
market value of more than 200 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The enlarged group will be known simply as BP with the familiar
BP shield and Amoco torch replaced by a fresh new symbol depicting
a vibrant sunburst of green, white and yellow which is intended to
exemplify dynamic energy in all its forms from oil and gas to
solar.
</P>
<P>
According to BP Amoco Chief Executive John Browne, the single
brand is expected to greatly strengthen the sense of identity and
common purpose of 100,000 staff members in more than 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
The revamp is part of a major drive by the group to promote its
retail business at 28,000 sites around the world by more than 10
percent a year, the company said.
</P>
<P>
It said that having spent some 7 million dollars on researching
and preparing the new brand, it plans to spend a further 25
million dollars in support of the brand change, mainly non-retail
signage and additional advertising.
</P>
<P>
According to the company, although BP will be the single global
brand, it intended to retain the value of some of its strong
product brands like Castrol, its premier lubricants brand
worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Court Rejects Medical Exams on Pinochet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Chile's Supreme Court of Justice
rejected Tuesday by 11 votes versus 9 the order of medical exams
on former military ruler Augusto Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Upon reporting the decision, plaintiff lawyer Hugo Gutierrez
said that until next Tuesday, the court will decide if it conforms
or rejects the privation of immunity decreed by the Santiago
Appeals Court on June 5
</P>
<P>
In May a Santiago court voted 13-9 to strip Pinochet of his
immunity from prosecution. Pinochet appealed that ruling to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Last week the court's judges heard testimony from attorneys
representing the families of victims of Pinochet's 17-year regime
and from lawyers defending Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
Chief Justice Hernan Alvarez summoned the court for a new
session Tuesday when a ruling on the immunity issue may be made
and announced.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet is accused of crimes committed mainly by the "caravan
of death" against opposers to the military regime.
</P>
<P>
The caravan of death was a military squad that traveled
several cities shortly after the 1973 coup, executing 72 jailed
dissidents. Nineteen of those victims have never been found.
</P>
<P>
The "caravan of death" is one of 148 criminal complaints filed
against Pinochet stemming from the human rights abuses during his
long reign.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's lawyer claimed that the former dictator had no
responsibility in the killings, but attorneys for the plaintiffs
insist that the chief of the caravan acted on Pinochet's behalf.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet suffers from diabetes, wears a pacemaker and sustained
three mild strokes in London, where he spent 16 months under house
arrest on a warrant by a Spanish judge wanting to try him for
human rights abuses.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests to U.N. Over Action of Turkish Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Tuesday lodged protests to
the United Nations over the concentration of Turkish troops at the
Iraqi-Turkish border, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
In two letters, one to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the
other to the president of the U.N. Security Council, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf described the move as "part of the
scheme" for the Turkish troops to enter Iraqi territory under "
fabricated pretexts."
</P>
<P>
Turkey should be responsible for any aggressive acts that
violate Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity, Al-Sahaf
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.N. to press Turkey to put an end to its
aggressive acts against Iraq, INA said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister has informed the U.N. of a Turkish
incursion into northern Iraq in late May.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahaf, in his letters, said that around 3,000 to 5,000
Turkish troops pushed deep inside a Kurdish-held enclave in
northern Iraq on May 23.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Turkish incursion has caused "human and
material losses" among Kurdish civilians in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops frequently cross the border into Iraq in pursuit
of rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), who have used
northern Iraq as a base since the end of the 1991 Gulf War,
triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad lost control over its northern provinces since 1991 when
local Kurds rose up after the end of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Political ties between Iraq and Turkey, neighboring Muslim
countries, have been frosty since the Gulf War, in which Turkey
joined the U.S.-led coalition that evicted Iraqi occupation troops
from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations are further strained by the Western use of
Turkey's military bases, by Turkish army raids into northern Iraq
against Kurds, and by differences over sharing the waters of the
Euphrates and Tigris rivers.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Stage Sit-in for Release of Arrested People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 people Tuesday staged a
sit-in in front of the so-called "prime minister's" office in
Cyprus' northern Turkish Cypriot-controlled area, demanding the
release of the people arrested during a violent protest Monday.
</P>
<P>
During Monday's clashes, 18 people were injured when "police"
used truncheons, tear gas and pressurized water to disperse a 3,
000-strong crowd which briefly occupied the "parliament" building,
and some 60 people are reportedly to have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
The exact number of those arrested has not been determined yet,
but at least 15 leading members of trade unions and a journalist
from the Avrupa daily are reported to be among them.
</P>
<P>
They were demanding the regime in the northern island to pay
their monthly compensation, which was overdue for the past few
months, to cover the losses incurred after six troubled banks were
put under "public administration" in the past six months.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's protesters said they would continue their
demonstration until the last person is released, and condemned the
authority's harsh reaction as an "attack on the will of the
public."
</P>
<P>
Reports said a large number of police, some in riot gear, were
watching closely at the situation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Geneva Tuesday, Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
said the scandal was "a question of banks and money affairs."
</P>
<P>
Denktash, who is in Geneva to attend the U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks on Cyprus, Monday called on the Turkish Cypriot "
government" to take urgent measures to deal with the growing anger
over the banking scandal, in which some 30,000 people lost about
200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would resign if he was the cause of the unrest,
noting that "nobody should think that I am looking to escape my
responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem has stated in
Ankara that the banking scandal was an internal issue of the
breakaway state in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Political parties and organizations in both the Turkish Cypriot
and the Greek Cypriot areas have expressed concerns over the
situation.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after an abortive pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
In 1983 the Turkish Cypriots declared a breakaway republic which
is only recognized by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> 39 Injured in Fighting Between Families in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-nine people were injured on
Tuesday when two families fought near Cairo with guns, knives,
clubs and stones over a student accused of recklessly driving.
</P>
<P>
Four suffered bullet wounds, while the others had knife wounds
and broken bones in the fighting in Tanash village, northwest of
the capital, the country's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The violence erupted early in the day after a 32-year-old farmer
shouted at a university student who was driving dangerously fast
through the village, Mohammed Foda, police chief for the area was
quoted as saying by the news agency.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the farmer then began fighting with the relatives
of
the student, which lasted more than two hours and involved at least
two revolvers, Foda said. Seventeen people were arrested, he added.
</P>
<P>
There have been at least four other violent clashes sparked by
traffic violations or fatal accidents in Egypt this year.

<HEADLINE> 20 Hurt in Christian-Muslim Clashes in Downtown Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Around 20 people were hurt, including
two policemen, in clashes in downtown Cairo on Tuesday between
African Christians and Egyptian Muslims after a car hit a
Christian.
</P>
<P>
The man hit by the car outside a church was given first aid on
the scene while Sudanese and other Africans attacked a bus which
they mistakenly believed was responsible, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The attackers dragged the Muslim driver of the bus inside the
church and proceeded to beat him up, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
A crowd of Egyptian Muslims forced their way into the church, a
meeting place for hundreds of African Christians living in Cairo,
and started throwing bricks which smashed church windows, the
witnesses said, adding that the Muslims set fire to a car belonging
to the church in the Abbassaya district in eastern Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of riot police eventually quelled the violence, while
firefighters doused the car on fire. They also rescued the battered
driver from the Christians and took him to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
Security officials said that 15 Christians were injured inside
and outside the church, and three Muslims were hurt, including the
driver, as well as two policemen who tried to stop the violence.
</P>
<P>
Police force blocked the roads leading to the church to prevent
further clashes.
</P>
<P>
No religious slogans were heard from either the Christian or the
Muslim side during the violence. However, the incident raised fears
among analysts that religious intolerance was growing in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Prepared for Clashes with Palestinians: Chief of Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Force (IDF) Chief
of Staff Shaul Mofaz said here on Tuesday the IDF army is ready for
any confrontation with the Palestinians in the occupied territories
as a possible result of the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
However, he voiced hope that there will be no such
confrontation, adding this will depend on the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In case that a violent confrontation occurs, the chief of staff
said the Israeli regular troops will deal with it if possible. He
made no mention of calling up the reserves.
</P>
<P>
This also applies to a possible unilateral declaration of a
Palestinian state on September 13 which might incur the outbreak of
confrontation between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Appearing before the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and
Defense Committee, the general warned the outbreak of violence can
also spread to the northern Israeli-Lebanese border as there are
tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees who are closely following
the Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which the Israeli, Palestinian and U.S. top leaders
attended in a bid to settle the issues such as the status of
Jerusalem, border, water resources, the future of Jewish
settlements and the Palestinian refugees, has failed without any
major breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
The IDF expects the U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese army forces
will be deployed throughout south Lebanon within "the next 48
hours" in the wake of the U.N. confirmation that the Israeli army
has rectified all violations of the international border set by the
U.N. to verify the IDF's full pullback from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The IDF ended its 22-year occupation of the region on May 24 by
conducting a unilateral and early withdrawal from the "security
zone" there it set up to protect its norther border.
</P>
<P>
Israeli military officials also suspect that Hezbollah, or the
Party of God, which has been fighting to oust the IDF occupying
southern Lebanon, will renew its attacks against Israeli targets at
short notice if and when there is such an order from Iran.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they detect no signs that the Hezbollah, which is
now entrenched in the former pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army (SLA)
and IDF positions, will stage an offensive.
</P>
<P>
The IDF has warned Hezbollah, like Hamas, the Palestinian
resistance movement, wants to kidnap Israeli soldiers or civilians
as bargaining chips for the release of Arab prisoners being held in
Israel. There are now about 1,600 Palestinian prisoners jailed in
Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
Mofaz also revealed that a number of reserve soldiers have sent
them their reserve documents in protest over the Tal bill which
entitles the ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students the privilege not to
do army service.
</P>
<P>
The reserve soldiers said they no longer want to be called up
for reserve duty if the yeshiva students are exempted from army
service. The Knesset passed on July 3 the first reading of the Tal
bill, which permits the yeshiva students to decide whether or not
to serve in the army at the age of 23. It needs the approval of two
further readings to become law.
</P>
<P>
The ordinary Israeli youths are obliged to serve in the army at
the age of 18 and will then join the reserve force after the army
service.
</P>
<P>
The chief of staff expressed concern over the development as it
might affect the morale of the army.
</P>
<P>
Both the Israelis and Palestinians have been making preparations
for possible scenarios when both sides are plunged into violent
clashes prompted by the failure in the Camp David summit talks or a
unilateral declaration of the Palestinian statehood.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests to U.N. Over Action of Turkish Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Tuesday lodged protests to
the United Nations over the concentration of Turkish troops at the
Iraqi-Turkish border, the official Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
In two letters, one to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the
other to the president of the U.N. Security Council, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf described the move as "part of the
scheme" for the Turkish troops to enter Iraqi territory under "
fabricated pretexts."
</P>
<P>
Turkey should be responsible for any aggressive acts that
violate Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity, Al-Sahaf
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the U.N. to pressure Turkey to put an end to its
aggressive acts against Iraq, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi foreign minister has informed the U.N. of a Turkish
incursion into northern Iraq in late May.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahaf, in his letters, said that around 3,000 to 5,000
Turkish troops pushed deep inside a Kurdish-held enclave in
northern Iraq on May 23.
</P>
<P>
He said the Turkish incursion has caused "human and material
losses" among Kurdish civilians in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops frequently cross the border into Iraq in pursuit
of rebels of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), who have used
northern Iraq as a base since the end of the 1991 Gulf War,
triggered by Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad lost control over its northern provinces since 1991 when
local Kurds rose up after the end of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Political ties between Iraq and Turkey have been frosty since
the Gulf War, in which Turkey joined the U.S.-led coalition that
evicted Iraqi occupation troops from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations are further strained by the Western use of
Turkey's military bases, by Turkish army raids into northern Iraq
against Kurds, and by differences over sharing the waters of the
Euphrates and Tigris rivers.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon, U.N. Cease Redeployment Due to New Israeli Intrusions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Israel's new border encroachments
has forced the U.N. and Lebanon to cease deployment of their troops
into Israeli-vacated south Lebanon, government spokesman told
Xinhua Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Hikmat Abu Zaid, spokesman of Prime Minister Salim Hoss, said
there are four new border encroachments along the border, in the
regions of Matalle, Sheihk Abada and Rameish, which occurred
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The new development has ceased the scheduled deployment of
peacekeepers in the area and the U.N. also confirmed these
encroachments and decided to postpone the operation", the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
He added Israelis are building roads on Lebanese territory and
his country will not allow its task forces and U.N. troops to be
deployed in the south unless Israel ends its intrusions.
</P>
<P>
But he has not revealed what Lebanon and the U.N. plan to do in
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon gave the United Nations the green light to deploy
peacekeeping forces along the entire border with Israel after the
Jewish state terminated all major encroachments on the Blue Line on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and Lebanon made a consensus Monday that Israel had
removed all major encroachments, which were confirmed by Lebanon
and the United Nations exactly two months after the Israeli
withdrawal on May 24.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan revealed at U.N. headquarters
in New York in a report to the Security Council Monday that
UNIFIL's deployment into the vacated zone will be staged on
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Ready for Conditional Talks With Iraq: DM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is ready to open talks
with Iraq in return for the release of some of the 600 people still
being held in Iraqi prisons, said the Kuwaiti defense minister
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah said he has no objections
to holding talks with the Iraqis on condition that they release 10
percent of the prisoners of war (POWs) and Kuwaiti hostages and
other third country nationals who number at more than 600 to
resolve this long-standing "humanitarian issue."
</P>
<P>
The announcement, carried by the official Kuwait News Agency,
came almost 10 years after Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990
and occupied it for seven months. The occupation touched off the
1991 Gulf war, during which the U.S.-led allies drove Iraqi troops
from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Salem, also the country's deputy prime minister, heads a
state body in charge of seeking the release of Kuwaiti POWs.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Iraq are locked in a dispute over the issue of POWs.
Kuwait insists Iraq is still holding over 600 Kuwaiti and third
country nationals since the 1991 Gulf war. But Baghdad denied the
Kuwaiti claim.
</P>
<P>
A thaw in relations between the two Arab foes can only come
after a breakthrough over the POWs issue, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Resolve Huge Pending Cases in Courts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maduna was speaking in Durban during the release of the mid-
term report of the National Prosecuting Authority of South Africa,
which revealed a backlog of more than 180,000 court cases, the
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
He said problems surrounding legal aid payments resulted in the
loss of more than 1,000 court hours per month, because defence
attorneys were not available.
</P>
<P>
"We must move away from legal aid as we know it," Maduna said,
adding the government intended to implement a public defence
system as an alternative to the legal aid system.
</P>
<P>
Maduna said the Department of Justice was working on a pilot
project to employ 250 law graduates to work for a period of two
years to get the public defence system moving.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time, we will also providing employment to these
graduates," Maduna said.
</P>
<P>
National Director of Public Prosecutions Bulelani Ngcuka said
the only way to solve the backlog was to build more courts.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to create more courts because some courts are
already performing beyond their capacity. In the meantime, the
Justice Department will have to reallocate underutilized resources
to where they were needed," Ngcuka said.

<HEADLINE> 280,000 Ethiopians Die of HIV/AIDS in 1999: UNICEF Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- It is estimated that some 280,
000 Ethiopians died of AIDS-related complications in 1999 alone,
an official of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are about 3 million adults and children in
Ethiopia living with HIV/AIDS, said UNICEF representative Ibrahim
Jabr at a news briefing, during which UNICEF's annual report, the
Progress of Nations 2000, was launched.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, there are now 16 countries, all in
sub-Saharan Africa, where more than one tenth of the adult
population aged 15-49 is infected with HIV, a virus that leads to
the killer disease AIDS.
</P>
<P>
About 10,3 million young people aged 15-24 in the world are
living with HIV/AIDS, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although AIDS cannot be cured, it can be prevented, Jabr said,
noting that breaking the silence about HIV/AIDS and changing
behaviors are two positive steps to stop AIDS.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that in the fight against AIDS, knowledge is power.
</P>
<P>
Education about the disease must start at a very young age so
that children can learn in stages and understand and internalize
that unsafe behaviors will put their very lives in danger, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to focusing on AIDS, the UNICEF official also
addressed the importance of early childhood care and the immunity
from infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF will join hands with the Ethiopian government to get rid
of polio in the country, he said.

choice for his running mate in the November election.
</P>
<P>
Democratic presidential candidate Gore said that he has
narrowed his running-mate search to a short list of possible
choices and is determined to keep the final considerations "very
private and dignified."
</P>
<P>
"We still have some work to do," Gore said. "I'm trying to keep
this process very private and dignified."
</P>
<P>
Gore declined to name the number of people on his short list,
but he said both men and women remain on his list.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to pick the person who I believe can become
president on a moment's notice if necessary, who also has a good
working relationship with me, or the prospect of one, and who
shares my values," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gore said he will announce his decision probably several days

14 in Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> EU-South Africa Wine Deal to Be Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union said Tuesday
that the EU-South Africa bilateral wines and spirits agreement
could not be implemented on September 1 as planned since the
African country refused to adopt the text of the pact.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has had disputes with the EU about the text of the
wines and spirits trade accord drawn up by the European Commission,
the EU's executive arm.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, EU farm Commissioner Franz Fischler wrote
to the South African government, asking it to "adopt the texts as
they stand" and to resume talks on changes after the agreement had
entered into force.
</P>
<P>
Fischler told reporters Tuesday that South Africa had refused
to accept this. "We got a negative answer from the South Africans
and therefore -- and I regret that very much -- we have to
continue the negotiations and there is not a possibility to
conclude the agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
EU officials said this reaction meant the agreement could not
be approved by the EU executive Wednesday at its last weekly
meeting before the summer break and so it could not be implemented
on September 1 as planned.

<HEADLINE> Only 3 Percent of Swiss Remember Words of National Anthem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Only 3 percent of the Swiss can
sing along to the national anthem, according to a new survey which
confirms the assumption that the national anthem is more popular
among the older generation.
</P>
<P>
The results are based on interviews with 555 people in the
German- and French-language regions of the country, Swiss Radio
International reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It was not until 1981 that the Swiss Psalm, as the anthem is
also known, officially became the national anthem. During the 19th
century and until after World War Two, Switzerland used the same
tune as Britain, but with different lyrics.
</P>
<P>
The text of the anthem has often been criticized over the past
decades. The somewhat pompous lyrics, especially in the German-
language version, date back to the first half of the 19th century,
and once accompanied a religious chant composed by a monk.
</P>
<P>
Several attempts have been made to create a new anthem. But the
latest effort failed last year, when the group behind it went
bankrupt.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Resumption of Israeli-Palestinian Talks EDS-Updated with more details </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday urged Israelis and Palestinians to find the way to resume
negotiations, and avoid unilateral actions that might prevent an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks right after his return to the White
House from Camp David following the collapse of the peace summit.
</P>
<P>
"I have concluded with regret that they will not be able to
reach an agreement," Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that "the most difficult problem" at the peace
talks was the future of Jerusalem. He said negotiators "tried a
lot of different approaches to it" without a solution.
</P>
<P>
But he still said he was encouraged that there doesn't seem to
be much disagreement about how the people of Jerusalem will live
after an agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
He said eventually the two sides would be able to bridge the
gaps "because I think the alternative is unthinkable."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that despite the failure of the summit, "we made
progress on all the core issues, we made really significant
progress on many of them."
</P>
<P>
He called on both parties to continue the search for compromise.
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of their children they must rededicate themselves
to the path of peace," he said.

<HEADLINE> Annan Disappointed at Failure of Israeli-Palestinian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday expressed his disappointment over the failure of
Israeli-Palestinian talks in Camp David.
</P>
<P>
The Camp David summit in pursuit of a Middle East settlement
collapsed Tuesday and the parties failed to reach an overall
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The breakdown came despite rounded efforts by U.S. President
Bill Clinton, who returned to Camp David Sunday night after a four-
day trip to Japan.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the U.N. spokesman's office said, " The
secretary-general is disappointed that, despite strenuous efforts
at the Camp David Summit, the parties were not able to reach an
overall agreement."
</P>
<P>
"Given the seriousness of the issues involved and their
importance for reaching a comprehensive peace in the Middle East,
he encourages (Israeli) Prime Minister (Ehud) Barak and (
Palestinian) leader (Yasser) Arafat to persist in their efforts to
find comprehensive solutions with courage and vision," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general commended U.S. President Bill Clinton for
his efforts to facilitate progress.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Plane Crashes Near Paris Killing 113 EDS-2nd lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS,July 25 (Xinhua) -- A Concorde supersonic passenger
plane of Air France crashed Tuesday afternoon soon after taking
off from the Roissy international airport north of Paris,killing
all 109 passengers and crew on board and four people on the ground,
said the French Interior Ministry and rescuers.
</P>
<P>
All the 100 passengers were German tourists, including 97
adults and three children, who were going to Equator via New York
with a German tourist company, Deilmann, while the nine crew
members were French, including six air hostesses.
</P>
<P>
The four people killed on the ground could be in a hotel near
the airport on which the plane came down.
</P>
<P>
Air France said that when the Concorde took off, its left
reactor was on fire.
</P>
<P>
A witness said that he saw a fire 20 to 30 meters long which
came out of the reactor and that the plane made a strange big
noise when taking off.
</P>
<P>
French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin arrived at the site of the
crash where a heavy security force was deployed while heavy smoke
was rising up from the site of the accident and a civil rescue
helicopter was flying overhead.
</P>
<P>
One person, who apparently was not one of the passengers, was
found injured on the site.
</P>
<P>
There is the first for a Concorde plane to crash since its
birth on March 2, 1969 and its maiden commercial flight in 1976.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS,July 25 (Xinhua) -- France has launched a judicial
investigation into the crash of the Concorde passenger plane of
Air France Tuesday afternoon which killed 113 people,including 109
people on board.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Transport Jean-Claude Gayssot said that the
inquiry will include all elements, both technological and
administrative, in order to make clear the causes of the disaster,
which is one of the worst in France's civil aviation history.
</P>
<P>
The president of Air France, Jean-Cyril Spinetta, said that the
crash was caused by a motor failure.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of Air France said that the left reactor of the
plane was on fire when it took off. It crashed two minutes after
taking off.
</P>
<P>
A witness working near the airport said that he saw a 20-30
meter long fire from the left engine of the Concorde and heard a
strange big noise when the plane took off.
</P>
<P>
The plane tried to return to the airport soon after taking off,
but all the tracks of the airport were closed, said French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
All the 100 passengers on board the plane were German tourists
who were going to Equator via New York, and the nine-member crew
was French.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac and Jospin telephoned German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to express their deepest condolences.
</P>
<P>
"Deeply shocked by the tragedy, I address to all the families
of the victims my most emotional condolences and express my
sharing of their pain," said Chirac in a communique.
</P>
<P>
The German embassy in Paris has opened a green number to answer
inquiries from the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
By evening Tuesday, about 400 French firemen have put down the
fire caused by the explosion of the plane when it crashed by the
side of a hotel near the Roissy airport north of Paris.
</P>
<P>
The plane was burnt down to a black skeleton and was hardly
recognizable, according to television pictures.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for a Concorde to crash since its launch
in 1968 by France and Britain and its maiden commercial flight in
1976.
</P>
<P>
Air France has 13 Concorde planes in service while British
Airways also has a dozen such planes.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Hearing Set on Illicit Diamonds from Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
committee that monitors sanctions against the Sierra Leonean
rebels will hold a public hearing from July 31 to August 1 to
probe the link between the illicit sale of diamonds from the West
African nation and arms trafficking, a U.N. spokesman said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The hearing was requested in a July 15 Security Council
resolution imposing an embargo on diamond exports from Sierra
Leone for at least 18 months unless the gems are sold under a
government certification system.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of interested states and regional
organizations, as well as of the diamond industry, will be invited
to take part in the hearing.
</P>
<P>
Interested states listed by the U.N. spokesman, in addition to
Sierra Leone, include all other members of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) as well as Angola, Belgium, India,
Israel, Liberia and South Africa. Sierra Leone is an ECOWAS member.
</P>
<P>
An extensive U.N. investigation earlier this year found that
Angola's rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) raised millions of dollars through the sale of illicit
diamonds to buy weapons and other war materials.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, India and Israel are important diamond-cutting
centers while South Africa is a major diamond producer.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Sierra Leone sanctions committee is
Anwarul Chowdhury, the permanent representative of Bangladesh to
the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing Home Sales Rise in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Sales of existing homes
increased 2.8 percent in June as Americans continued to lock in
deals before mortgage rates climb higher, the National Association
of Realtors reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The stronger-than-expected performance pushed sales of existing
single-family homes to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.23
million units, the highest level in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
June's gain followed a May rise of 4.3 percent to 5.09 million
units, an increase that also was attributed to buyers scrambling
to secure deals in the face of rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
With plentiful jobs, rising incomes and stock market gains,
Americans are feeling wealthy and in the mood to spend.
</P>
<P>
The average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was
8.29 percent in June, down from 8.52 percent in May, but much
higher than the 7.55 percent average rate in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Even with the higher level of interest rates we've been
experiencing this year, affordability remains pretty good,
especially for trade-up buyers," said Dennis Cronk, the
association's president.
</P>
<P>
Because of the higher rates, existing home sales are 6.4
percent lower than the level posted in June last year. The
industry expects existing-home sales to be down more than 9
percent from last year's record 5.2 million level.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times in the
last 13 months to slow the economy and keep inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest concern is for first-time buyers, who are more
sensitive to higher interest rates. With a sustained level of
higher mortgage rates, fewer first-time buyers will be able to
afford homes later this year," said Cronk.
</P>
<P>
By region, the Northeast saw sales rise 9.8 percent in June to
a rate of 670,000 units. Sales in the West rose 6 percent to a
rate of 1.42 million. In the South, sales grew 1 percent to a rate
of 2.01 million. But in the Midwest, sales fell 1.7 percent to a
rate of 1.13 million.
</P>
<P>
The median sales price, the level at which half the homes sold
for more and half for less, was 139,800 U.S. dollars in June, up 2.
1 percent from May.

<HEADLINE> Russia Will Be Short of 5 Million Tons of Grain in 2000: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia will be short of over 5
million tons of grain to feed its population this year although
the country's grain production is expected to rise 12-15 percent
to 65-67 million tons against last year, said a Russian official
report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Russia's grain harvest in 2000 is estimated to rise 12-15
percent over last year thanks to "good agro-meteorological
conditions and slightly improved supplies of gasoline and diesel
fuel," according to a report by the Russian Economic Development
and Trade Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Total agricultural production will go up around 3 percent
compared to last year, but the state's grain shortage is still to
stand at a little more than 5 million tons by the end of the year,
the ministry predicted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, data released by the State Customs Committee and the
State Committee for Statistics show that Russia boosted wheat
imports by 37.8 percent in January-May 2000.
</P>
<P>
During the period, Russia imported 1,382,200 tons of wheat
compared to 1,002,900 tons in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, most of imported wheat -- 1,375,
500 tons -- came from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
and only 6,700 tons from other countries.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Russia's food imports were dominated by wheat from
countries outside the former Soviet Union, which amounted to 777,
900 tons; the rest -- 225,100 tons -- were from the CIS.
</P>
<P>
The average price of wheat in the first five months of this
year in Russia was 87.7 U.S. dollars per ton, while the index in
the corresponding term of 1999 was 64.5 dollars, show the
statistics.

<HEADLINE> EU to Host 3rd U.N. Conference on Least Developed Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The third U.N. Conference
on the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) will be hosted by the
European Union (EU) in Brussels on May 14-20, 2001, to address the
severe socio-economic underdevelopment of the 48 LCDs, the most
vulnerable countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here Tuesday at a press conference by
Rubens Ricupero, secretary-general of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). He is in New York
this week to attend the first meeting of the Intergovernmental
Preparatory Committee for the conference, which is responsible for
the substantive and organizational arrangements for Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, the European Union countries, as a whole,
will host the conference," he said. "We hope the May conference in
Brussels will identify specific areas" on LDCs.
</P>
<P>
The conference will assess, at the country level, the results
of the Program of Action for the LDCs for the 1990s, which was
adopted in Paris in 1990 at the Second United Nations LDC
Conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference will review the implementation of international
support measures, particularly in the areas of the Official
Development Assistance (ODA), debt, investment and trade.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also consider the formulation and adoption
of appropriate national and international policies and measures
for the sustainable development of the LDCs and their progressive
integration into the world economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the United Nations General Assembly decided to
convene the Third U.N. Conference on LDCs in response to the
persistent socio-economic underdevelopment of these countries and
their continued marginalization in the global economy and world
trade.
</P>
<P>
The LDCs are a category of developing countries which are
officially recognized by the United Nations as being especially
disadvantaged. They make up one-tenth of the world's population --
600 million people.

WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak is considering ending the Camp David peace summit on Tuesday
night without an agreement, Israeli sources said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no progress, no decisions have been made," one of the
Israeli sources said.
</P>
<P>
"The Israelis have made extremely generous proposals in all
areas, including Jerusalem, but the Palestinians did not give a
positive response," he said. "If the Palestinians won't agree on
all the areas, including Jerusalem, border and the refugees, this
will end without an agreement."

WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat is angry at Israel's uncompromising position and preparing
to leave the Camp David peace summit, a Palestinian official said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"He is very angry and he doesn't believe the Israelis are
willing to make peace. It's a waste of time to stay here any
longer," said the official, who is in touch with negotiators at
Camp David.
</P>
<P>
He said Arafat had called for his motorcade and had ordered his
plane to be prepared for his departure.
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic source said the United States was still mediating
to try to avoid a Palestinian walkout on the 15th day of the
marathon summit.

<HEADLINE> Lightning Causes Forest Fires in Southern Alberta, Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Lightning started two forest fires
Monday in Canada's southern Alberta province, where dry conditions
have been reported since late June.
</P>
<P>
The fire covers an area about 32 kilometers long and eight
kilometers wide in a ranch land about 85 kilometers south of
Lethbridge in Milk River, reported Mike Ross, deputy chief of the
Lethbridge Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, firefighters, six bulldozers and six helicopters
were battling another lightning-induced forest fire at Blairmore,
where blaze has destroyed a 175-hectare area.
</P>
<P>
There has been no accumulation of rain in the southern part of
the province since June 24, said Ross.
</P>
<P>
"As far as moisture content, I would say it's an unusual year,"
the deputy chief added.
</P>
<P>
Southern Alberta has witnessed a spate of fires in the past few
years because of dry conditions. Several communities in the
southern part of the province evacuated in 1999 as a result of
grass fire.
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, a blaze stripped 28,000 hectares of grazing
land, destroying 800 kilometers of fence and an undetermined
number of livestock.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Satisfied at South Korea's Move on Food Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Foreign Trade Minister
Pierre Chevalier and Minister of Environment Megda Aelvoet have
expressed their satisfaction with the lifting of the ban on
Belgian food products by the South Korean authorities, local media
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of the embargo, which was introduced following last
year's dioxin-in-food crisis, shows confidence in Belgium's system
of controls on food products, as well as recognition of the
quality of Belgian products, according to the ministers.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a South Korean delegation visited farms, slaughter
houses and meat processing factories across Belgium to inspect
production methods. Local reports said they gave the Belgian meat
industry a thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
South Korea last week lifted its ban on the import of Belgian
food products. The announcement came as a good news for Belgium's
pig sector that will once again be able to export pork to South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The east Asian country used to be one of Belgium's largest
importers of pig and pig products.

</P>
<P>
Clinton is headed back to the White House to make an statement,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sources said the breaking point came when Israeli
balked at Palestinian sovereignty over Jerusalem's walled Old City,
offering only access to the Al Aqsa mosque, the third-holiest site
in Islam. Arafat was infuriated by this, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
At 3 a.m. on Tuesday, Arafat sent a letter to Clinton, saying
he saw no point in continuing because the Israeli position on
Jerusalem could never lead to an agreement, Palestinian sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The breakdown came despite redoubled efforts by Clinton, who
returned to Camp David on Sunday night after four day of G8 summit
in Okinawa, Japan.

WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton met nearly around the clock
Monday with Israeli and Palestinian negotiators as peace talks at
Camp David assumed a torrid pace. Prospects for a deal were still
murky, however, as Clinton embarked on a "rolling assessment" of
whether to continue the summit after 14 agonizing days.
</P>
<P>
-- Texas Governor George W. Bush has settled on former defense
secretary Richard B. Cheney as his vice presidential running mate
and is expected to announce the decision sometime on Tuesday,
according to a senior Republican source.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- As Vice President Al Gore and Governor George W. Bush
prepare to frame their messages at the national conventions, most
Americans say they already perceive pronounced differences on how
they would handle health care, taxes, the environment and the
selection of Supreme Court justices, a latest New York Times/CBS
News poll showed.
</P>
<P>
-- The famous Central Park in downtown New York was closed
Monday night after city officials announced that they had found
mosquitoes infected with West Nile virus in the part and would
spend the night blanketing the area with pesticides.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The Federal Bureau of Investigation defended its Carnivore
Internet-surveillance software to a largely skeptical
congressional oversight panel, telling lawmakers that the
electronic eavesdropping system is used only when approved by a
judge and needed to protect citizens from criminals and terrorists.

<P>
SHANGHAI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Anti-drug officials from China,
Cambodia, Viet Nam, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar, gathered here
today to probe ways for further cooperation among the six east
Asian countries in fighting against drug crimes.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the UNDCT Y2K Regional Drug Enforcement

<P>
Yang Fengrui, an official with China's National Narcotics

Yang said that China, as a member of the international anti-
drug corps, has been diligent in cracking down on drug-related
crimes.

China has been making full use of laws, administrative measures,
cultural and educational means for preventing and battling drug
crimes, he said, adding that China has focused especially on
preventing young people's involvement in drug crimes.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Nuclear Power Project Aborted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit
announced on Tuesday afternoon that the government had decided to
cancel the 5-billion-U.S. dollar-tender for the country's first-
ever nuclear power plant on the ground of financial constraint.
</P>
<P>
The long-delayed decision emerged during a cabinet meeting,
reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"The cancellation of tender for Akkuyu nuclear station does not
mean that we quit considering nuclear energy in the future," Ecevit
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He argued,"It will be better if we consider nuclear power
stations after we solve our economic problems." "It is better for
us to put nuclear file to the shelf and not take it down until we
have implemented the whole economic reform program," he added.
</P>
<P>
A controversy, which arose over the safety of the nuclear
project, has caused the tender to be put off more than five times
since bids were received in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Most recently the tender has been postponed because the Treasury
refused to provide financing guarantees for fear that these should
disrupt the government's disinflation program.
</P>
<P>
Three international consortia have been competing for the huge
nuclear plant that is planned to be built in Akkuyu in Icel
province on Turkey's southern Mediterranean coast.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Westinghouse, which leads one of the three bidding
consortia, has announced that it will quit if the tender is
postponed again. The Franco-German NPI and Canadian AECL expressed
desire to stick to the end.
</P>
<P>
The project was strongly opposed by anti-nuclear groups and
greenpeace activists, who argue that there is no need for the
country to have a nuclear option in its energy development and that
the projected site for the plant lies close to an earthquake fault
line.
</P>

Turkey, poor in carbon fuels, has relied mainly on imports from

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Officials Deny Crown Prince On Board Before Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian officials on Tuesday denied
as baseless reports that Crown Prince Hamza Bin Hussein was on
board a Jordanian C-130 transport plane before it crashed in
eastern Amman earlier in the day, killing 14 military officers.
</P>
<P>
In an urgent brief dispatch, Jordan's official news agency Petra
quoted unnamed senior officials as saying that the reports were
groundless, and Prince Hamza was the first to arrive at the scene
after the crash, some 70 kilometers east of the capital city Amman.
</P>
<P>
Hamza is a half-brother of King Abdullah Bin Hussein, and his
safety remains a sensitive topic in the kingdom, where there is a
tradition of primogeniture succession to the throne though the
constitution says a brother of the king could also become an heir.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Hamza was among the 60 parachuters from the
elite airborne forces of the kingdom, who had landed safely with
parachutes before the plane developed a technical failure
and crashed.
</P>
<P>
The C-130 was conducting a routine training mission before the
accident.
</P>
<P>
However, 14 military officers, including the crew members died
instantly when the plane crashed in the worst air disaster in the
kingdom in recent years.
</P>
<P>
A F-15 fighter plane crashed in 1999, killing one pilot, but his
co-pilot was ejected out of the cabin and landed safely with a
parachute.

<HEADLINE> Khatami for Oil Price Stability, Cooperation with Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
here on Tuesday expressed support for measures to stabilize oil
prices and called for Iran-Kuwait cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Bringing a logical stability to oil prices is a necessity to
prevent damages being inflicted on both oil producers and
consumers, Khatami told visiting Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Saud
Nasser Al-Sabah, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said Iran backs the price mechanism adopted by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which aims to
keep oil prices at a satisfactory level.
</P>
<P>
But he made no indication whether OPEC should increase output,
as some member countries and OPEC leaders suggested, in the current
situation to bring down the high oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh has said Tehran
opposes an emergency output increase, which is too early and
immature given the current market conditions.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Khatami also called for cooperation between Iran
and Kuwait in all fields to safeguard peace and security in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Kuwait are both OPEC members and they are located in
the same region, which has provided a good opportunity to foster
cooperation and solidarity between the two nations, Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on regional states to exercise logic and
foresight to reach understanding and hold friendly dialog to
reinforce stability.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, the Kuwaiti oil minister also called for
expanding cooperation between the two countries, especially in the
field of oil, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Sabah emphasized the need for cooperation between regional
states to protect security and stability in the Persian gulf
without external interference.
</P>
<P>
On OPEC policies and oil prices, he said the organization should
always take into account the interests of its member nations.
</P>
<P>
Sabah arrived here Monday at the invitation of Zanganeh. He has
held talks with Zanganeh on oil cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes Over One Ton of Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran's security forces seized more
than one ton of illicit drugs from smugglers on Tuesday in the city

of Nahbandan in the northeastern province of Khorasan.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial security forces department, the
seized drugs included 1,020 kilometers of opium and 25 kilometers
of heroin, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Drug hauls have become very common in Iran as it sits on a major
route for smuggling narcotics from the eastern neighbors of
Afghanistan and Pakistan to the lucrative markets in the Persian
Gulf, Europe and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic republic started a strict anti-drug campaign in 1989

after the Majlis (parliament) passed an anti-drug law authorizing
capital punishment for drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
So far, some 3,000 people of Iran's security forces have lost
their lives in the campaign and millions of U.S. dollars have been
spent to prevent the passage of smuggled drugs from the country's
eastern borders.

<P>
BANGKOK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN+3 forum contributes
significantly to the political and economic stability of East Asia,
the foreign ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a joint communique at the end of the 33rd
Ministerial Meeting, the 10 ASEAN minister said they are gratified

</P>
<P>
The process now includes annual summit and cooperation at
various levels and in several sectors.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers noted with satisfaction the rapid growth
of cooperation activities under the ASEAN+3 Framework for East
Asia Cooperation, especially in trade, economic and financial
cooperation.

<P>
They looked forward to their meeting with the foreign minister
of China, Japan and the ROK Wednesday, the first meeting of the 13

<P>
BANGKOK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) wound up their two-
day annual gathering here Tuesday, committing to promoting a
comprehensive development agenda for a more prosperous,
competitive and socially cohesive ASEAN in the new century.
</P>
<P>
During the 33rd ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM), the foreign
ministers from 10 ASEAN members held extensive and in-depth
discussions on issues relating to political and security
cooperation, regional and international impact of globalization on
the region, social problems facing ASEAN in the wake of the Asian
financial crisis, as well as regional economic integration.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Despite their divergent views on some issues, as an immediate
achievement of the two-day talks, the ministers signed a Joint
Declaration for A Socially Cohesive and Caring ASEAN, declaration
on the protection of culture heritage and the establishment of the
ASEAN Foundation.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to speed up the implementation of an joint
effort to build a drug-free ASEAN from 2020 to 2015.
</P>
<P>
Many participants consented that one big challenge now facing
ASEAN lies in social problems following the Asian crisis, such as
transnational crime, the menace of illicit drugs, trafficking in
women and children, environmental degradation, diseases, among
other issues.

<P>
At the opening ceremony of the meeting, Thai Prime Minister
Chuan Leekpai proposed a comprehensive development action plan,
which is based on three pillars: reach out to the people, economic
integration and ASEAN as "a concert of nations."
</P>
<P>
Saying the overall security environment in the Southeast Asian
region remains stable and peaceful, the ministers praised the
progress in implementing the Treaty on the Southeast Asia Nuclear
Weapons Free Zone (SEANWFZ), and voiced continuing support for the
sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national unity of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
They also welcomed the implementing of the decision of the
Third ASEAN Informal Summit in Manila last November to set up an
ASEAN Troika, comprising the immediate past and future ASEAN
chairs along with the current one, to lead the way on ad hoc
regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The ministers believed that the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea(DPRK)'s participating in the upcoming 7th ASEAN Regional
Forum ARF), which serves as the only mechanism for political and
security dialogue between the group and the outside world, will
reinforce the progress in regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
In the joint communique of the meeting, ASEAN ministers
expressed their hope to forge stronger ties with China, Japan and
the Republic of Korea (ROK), and urged quick implementation of the
Joint Statement of East Asia Cooperation, issued in Manila last
September.
</P>
<P>
The coming together of the ASEAN countries and China, Japan and
ROK, they said, poses no threat to anyone but rather an effort to
promote peace and stability in the East Asia.
</P>
<P>
On the economic dimension, ASEAN is showing sustainable
recovery from the crisis in 1997, with its GDP growing 4.4 percent
and its exports expanding 6.4 percent last year, the ministers
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
However, some participants expressed their concern about the
challenges of the globalization, which will probably push ASEAN to
the rim of world economy and widen digital gap among its members.
</P>
<P>
On this point, they proposed that the grouping should focus on
trade liberalization and economic integration among other methods
to catch up with the global economic trend.
</P>
<P>
However, progress has been made towards regional economic
integration and in creating an environment conducive to greater
trade and investment in the region, the ministers acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
They urged further strengthening of intra-regional economic
ties in the fields such as trade liberalization, tariff reduction,
industrial cooperation, the "e-ASEAN" initiative, and the
development of the sub-Mekong region.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging progresses have also been seen in financial, energy
and transportation cooperation within the ASEAN, they addressed.
</P>
<P>
The AMM comprising foreign ministers of its 10 members, meets
annually in each member country in turn to formulate policy
guidelines and coordinate ASEAN activities. The next AMM will be
held in Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> China Set Taxation Reform Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China has set five targets to
reform the taxation system in the near future, Finance Minister
Xiang Huaicheng said today.
</P>
<P>
Xiang told a national work meeting on finance that China will
gradually change the value-added tax into a tax levied on consumer
goods instead of one levied on corporate revenues.
</P>
<P>
The government will also expand the scope of consumption taxes
to cover more goods and services.
</P>
<P>
According to Xiang, China will get rid of the existing income
tax rates for Chinese and foreign-funded enterprises and adopt a
uniform tax rate system.
</P>
<P>
China will gradually set up a revenue sharing system between
central and local governments and phase out preferential tax rates
adopted in certain regions to encourage the growth of certain
professions and subsidize certain sectors.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that China will give full play to the role of
personal income and heritage taxes to narrow the gap between the
rich and the poor. A complete system of personal income taxes will
be set up for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
The country will also utilize tariff quotas and control of
tariff payment to set up an open and standardized tariff system,
Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that China will also sort out and regulate
all kinds of preferential taxation policies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has formulated a plan of replacing
arbitrary charges on motor vehicles and road transportation taxes.
The plan has already been approved by the legislature and will be
put into effect some time later, said Xiang.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has also started eliminating
arbitrary charges in rural areas and readjusting taxes for farmers
in some areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government is also preparing to push forward
tax reforms in other sectors to promote the steady increase of
fiscal revenues.

The deputy director of the publicity center, Yuan Tiexiang, was
quoted as saying that Chinese should not be so shy about their
bodies.
</P>
<P>
In China, open discussion of sex has long been taboo.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of couples in economically-developed southern
cities shows that 67 percent claimed to be dissatisfied with their
sex life, 30 percent of the newlyweds said they know little about
the basics of sex, while two-thirds of the men said they have
experienced impotence.

"Modern Chinese probably need more exhibitions on sex like this,
" said one middle-aged visitor after seeing the show.

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn Against Erosion of Black Soil in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Experts of water and soil
conservation warned that if serious efforts are not made to
prevent water and soil erosion of the vast black soil land in
northeast China, the black soil layer there may disappear within
50 years.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Ministry of Water Resources said the black
soil in northeast China's Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces,
covering 117,800 square kilometers, faces a serious soil erosion
problem.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the deterioration of the black soil land to
human activities and natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The black soil land in northeast China, one of the world's
three black soil zones, is one of China's major grain production
bases.
</P>
<P>
This area sells 10 billion kilograms of crops to the government
annually.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Water Resources indicated that
the water and soil erosion space of the black soil land in
northeast China has reached 44,700 square kilometers, accounting
for 37.9 percent of the total black soil land.
</P>
<P>
Water and soil erosion there also led to an increasing number
of disasters such as floods, droughts and sand storms.
</P>
<P>
A key factor in the heavy flooding of the Songhua River and
Nenjiang River in 1998 was the serious water and soil erosion in
the upper and middle parts of the two rivers.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province in south China
aims to reach its goal of exporting 90 billion yuan (122 U.S.
dollars) in goods this year, so that it can continue to claim 40
percent of the country's total exports.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Governor Tang Bingquan made the pledge at a provincial
foreign trade conference held today.
</P>
<P>
The province's exports saw a year-on-year 32.9 percent rise to
42.86 billion U.S. dollars during the first six-month period.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong also reported an increase in foreign investment in
the same period, with total foreign direct investment up 42
percent to 3.85 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Tang warned that growth rates of both exports and
foreign investment went down month by month in the half-year
period, and more efforts are needed to hit the target for the year.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, Guangdong will continue to expand its export
markets in Hong Kong, Macao, the United States, Japan and European
countries, while tapping new markets in eastern Europe, southeast
Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: HK's First Half Year Trade Performance Remarkable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's external trade
performance in the first half of 2000 was quite remarkable, and
the prospect for the second half year is also promising given
China's impending entry into the World Trade Organization, an
economist said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Even allowing for the fact that the improvement was powered by
a surge in demand for the mainland's re-export through Hong Kong,
the notable trade rise was still a solid outcome, said Ian K
Perkin, chief economist of the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Giving an overall picture of Hong Kong's strong external trade
performance, Perkin noted that in current dollar terms, both Hong
Kong's exports and imports reached record levels in the opening
six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Export hit 721.2 billion HK dollars (92.46 billion U.S. dollars)
, and imports soared to 769.9 billion HK dollars (98.7 billion U.S.
dollars), pipping the 1997 peak of 768 billion HK dollars (98.46
billion U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the pace of growth for all segments in the first
half was the best since 1995, Perkin said Hong Kong registered a
18.5 percent growth for the total exports, 19.8 percent for re-
export, 9.8 percent for domestic exports and 21.5 percent for
imports.
</P>
<P>
"The growth in re-export trade is hardly surprising given China
's own exports surged 38.3 percent to 114.5 billion U.S. dollars
in the opening six months and imports were up 36.2 percent to 102.
1 billion U.S. dollars," said Perkin.
</P>
<P>
Given such a strong performance overall, it is hardly
surprising that Hong Kong's Financial Secretary Donald Tsang Yam-
kuen declared that the economy would "have a quite impressive
performance" in the second half of the year, said Perkin.
</P>
<P>
The economist also warned that it may be unfavorable factors
for Hong Kong to maintain the pace of trade growth.
</P>
<P>
The pace of import growth is faster than total exports, so that
the resulting higher merchandise deficit will become a drag on
economic growth sometime in the near term future, despite the
offsetting services trade surplus, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Much will depend on whether demand for the mainland goods is
maintained in the U.S., Europe and the East Asia region in the
coming months, especially if the U.S. economy continues to slow
after the normal summer lull is over," he added.
</P>
<P>
But the economist believed the imminent prospect of China's
formal entry into the WTO could be enough to continue to boost
Hong Kong and the whole Chinese trade during the remainder of this
year and into 2001.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of a more open China in the near term as a result
of China's WTO entry may encourage more traders from around the
world to enter the Hong Kong market sooner than later to ensure
their position ahead of the formal entry.
</P>
<P>
"This could help both exports from and imports to China moving
through the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region," he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Reinstates Banking License to Bank of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Bank Negara (State Bank)
Malaysia announced Tuesday its decision to allow Bank of China to
recommence its banking operations in Malaysia with effect from
August 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in a statement that the reinstatement of a
banking license to Bank of China is made under special
circumstances and is in fulfillment of the following that Bank of
China was operating in Malaysia before and had given up its
license previously because of a legal requirement that prohibited
a bank under the effective control of a foreign government to hold
a banking license in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The prohibitions was subsequently removed following the
amendment to the Banking and Financial Institutions Act 1989 in
1996, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said Bank of China commenced operations in Malaya shortly
before World war II with a branch in Kuala Lumpur, Penang and
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The bank's operations were closed when the Banking Ordinance
1958 was promulgated as the Ordinance stipulated that no bank
which was under the effective control of foreign government should
hold a banking license in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
This prohibition was subsequently embodied in Section 14 of the
Banking and Financial Institutions Act 1989 but subsequently
removed on August 2, 1996, it said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said with the re-establishment of Bank of
China in Malaysia, it is hoped that bilateral and trade ties
between Malaysia and China would be further enhanced.

<HEADLINE> Somali Shilling Strengthens as Hopes for Peace Increased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Somali currency has been
strengthening as hopes for the establishment of a new Somali
government increased with the proceeding of the Djibouti peace
conference.
</P>
<P>
The Somali currency was exchanged at 9, 500 shillings to one U.
S. dollar on Tuesday, compared with 10,040 shillings to a dollar
four days ago.
</P>
<P>
Three months before the Djibouti conference began, the shilling
had been exchanged at 11,500 to one dollar, but it has been
steadily gaining ground with the progress of the Djibouti
conference.
</P>
<P>
Many currency dealers attributed the appreciation of the
shilling to the growing optimism that a government is now in sight
for Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Despite the rising trend, there have been big fluctuations in
the currency since many worried that the peace conference might
fail as none of the 12 previous meetings produced any results.
</P>
<P>
"Twelve previous meetings had ended up in failure after the
foreign governments interested in Somali affairs had proved their
disagreement over how the Somali crises would be settled," said
Mohamed Ali Mohamud, a money dealer in Bakara market.
</P>
<P>
The dealer said, "The confusion has made us worry and the
currency to fluctuate."
</P>
<P>
The goal of the Djibouti peace conference which started in
early May is to choose a 225-member parliament, prime minister and
president, hopefully by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Warlords, each backed by ragtag militias, have ruled over the
splintered pieces of Somalia since the January 1991 ouster of
Mohamed Siad Barre, the dictator who ruled the Horn of Africa
nation for 21 years. Since then, no central government has been
put in place.

<HEADLINE> UNIFIL and Lebanese Army to Deploy in South Lebanon Simultaneously </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has given the United Nations
green light to deploy peacekeeping forces along the entire border
with Israel after Israel terminated all major encroachments on the
border line, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Salim Hoss told As Safir newspaper that a task
force of 500 Lebanese troops and 500 policemen would be deployed
simultaneously with the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).
</P>
<P>
Al Kifah Al Arabi newspaper said the task force will handle
security affairs of all towns and villages in the Israeli-vacated
region while a reinforced UNIFIL would be in total charge of the
border with Israel.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Lebanese government has decided to ask the
Hezbollah Tuesday to hand over or remove all fortified positions
and observation posts its guerrillas set up along the border when
the resistance group took effective control of the liberated zone
after the Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
U.N. envoy Terje Roed-Larsen told a news conference Monday that
Israel had removed all border encroachments." (U.N.) Secretary
General Kofi Annan and President Lahoud agreed that when we confirm
the end of encroachment, UNIFIL should be redeployed in the south",
he added.
</P>
<P>
An Nahar newspaper said the removal of all major encroachments
was confirmed by Lebanon and United Nations exactly two months
after the Israeli withdrawal on May 24.
</P>
<P>
Hoss confirmed Larsen's statement, saying Israel has corrected
the major violations of the blue line and, consequently, UNIFIL
would soon deploy along the entire border, complete with U.N. truce
observers assigned to monitor violations of the borderline, As
Safir newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanon maintained its reservations about the Shabaa
farms and two other border locations opposite the Israeli
settlements of Metullah and Misgav Am, An Nahar newspaper quoted
Hoss as saying.
</P>
<P>
Annan revealed at U.N. headquarters in New York that UNIFIL's
deployment into the vacated zone would be staged on Wednesday,
followed immediately by Lebanese troops.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Pledges to Protect Cultural Heritage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the "Declaration on Cultural Heritage" signed here Tuesday
afternoon after the 33rd ASEAN ministerial meeting, ASEAN says it
is fully aware that cultural creativity and diversity guarantee
the ultimate viability of the ASEAN societies, and therefore it is
imperative for the region to affirm its national dignity.
</P>
<P>
However, it warns that in face of the increasing dominance of "
material culture," ASEAN member countries should work hard for "
the affirmation of human spirituality, creative imagination and
wisdom" of the region that, like other regions of the world,
stands very high in the history of human civilization.
</P>
<P>
Planning to cooperate with other countries or organizations for
the establishment of national and regional inventories, databases
and networks, ASEAN makes it clear that "cultures with global
reach" must not deprive local, national and regional cultures of
their own development dynamics. Otherwise, it stresses, the
process will only reduce the cultures of the developing countries
to relics of the past.
</P>
<P>
Asking for the recognition of intellectual property rights,
ASEAN says traditional knowledge systems and practices are
collectively owned by their local community of origin. These
communities are entitled to "have access, protection and rights of
ownership," it stressed, urging the United Nations and other
international organizations to increase financial resources and
enact laws and regulations. Only in this way, ASEAN says, could
the vast cultural resources and rich heritage of civilizations,
ideas, and value systems of the Asia region be protected,
preserved and promoted for the benefit of the whole mankind.

<HEADLINE> Hepatitis to Escalate Rapidly in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani health experts fear
that hepatitis B and C cases will rise to an alarming level within
the next 10 years which will flagellate the country both in terms
of human as well as economic losses, Associated Press of Pakistan
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Dr. Muhammad Umar, a renowned gastrologist, the report
said the hepatitis carriers in the country are rapidly escalating
due to lack of awareness.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Umar, who is also the General Secretary of the Pakistan
Association for Study of Liver Disease (PASLD) said that hepatitis
virus is deadlier than AIDS virus but unfortunately in Pakistan no
heed is paid to it.
</P>
<P>
"We need a comprehensive and contingent anti-hepatitis plan on
national level to tackle it before it went on rampage", he added.
</P>
<P>
Dr Umar said, the hepatitis virus is transmitted in a manner
similar to the HIV virus that causes AIDS: mother to child,
unscreened blood transfusion, infected needles, sexual
relationship, surgical intervention with improperly sterilized
instruments.

<HEADLINE> Manila Intensifies Anti-Drug Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing a media briefing here, Interior and Local Government
Secretary Alredo Lim presented an Anti-Drug Manual containing
measures and strategies that would further boost President Joseph
Estrada's call to intensify antiillegal drugs campaign made during
his State-of-the-Nation Address Monday.
</P>
<P>
Among the significant measures embodied in the manual include
the Presidential Award for Best Performing Local Government Units
Against Illegal Drugs; and the creation by the Supreme Court of
special courts to specifically handle drugs cases.
</P>
<P>
Official reports said about 23 percent of Filipinos are hooked
on illegal drugs. The estimate means 17.25 million Filipinos,
based on the current population of 75 million, are drug abusers.
</P>
<P>
Illegal drug trafficking in the country has also become a very
lucrative business for drug lords who earn about 6.2 billion U.S.
dollars yearly.
</P>
<P>
Lim said the president has already directed Budget Secretary
Benjamin Diokno to allocate 10 million pesos (250,000 U.S. dollars)
for the operational requirements of the awards program aimed at
propelling local officials and their constituents to perform
better and achieve a tradition of work excellence for a drug-free
society.
</P>
<P>
The award shall be divided into three categories namely, Best
Performer City, Best Performer Municipality, and Best Performer
Community.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary Narciso Santiago, meanwhile, explained the
creation of special courts is intended to speed up the resolution
of drug cases and help deter or minimize drug-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
Other measures adopted in the manual include the organization
and strengthening of local anti-drug abuse councils, and
initiating and sustaining advocacy and information campaign.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Estrada enjoined all provincial governors,
city mayors, municipal mayors and community leaders to coordinate
with other government agencies and non-government organizations to
intensify local government actions against illegal drugs.

Expressing that ASEAN would like to hear the concerns, reasons

contribution ASEAN can make is to make sure that confidence would
not be affected by arms buildup and people can go on "talking and
discussing without working under the pressure of fear".

<HEADLINE> China Fighting Acid Rain, Sulfur Dioxide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China has decreased the release of
sulfur dioxide by 1.86 million tons over the past two years as a
result of its efforts to combat acid rain and sulfur dioxide
control.
</P>
<P>
A total of 98 cities in the designated acid rain and sulfur
dioxide control regions have met national standards, said the
State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) today.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the State Council designated 11.4 percent of China's
land, covering 175 cities in 27 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities as acid rain and sulfur dioxide control regions.
The sulfur dioxide releasing amount in these regions makes up 60
percent of China's total.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, the number of cities that have met the
national standards has increased from 81 to 98, and the amount of
sulfur dioxide has decreased from 14.08 million tons to 11.14
million tons.
</P>
<P>
Beijing and Shanghai have taken the lead to set up areas
without coal burning. By the end of last year, the output of high
sulfur coal decreased by 32 million tons. Some 250 thermoelectric
generating sets were shut down.
</P>
<P>
China plans to shut down another 4,000 high sulfur coal mines,
135 thermoelectric generating sets and 1,300 small-sized cement
and glass production lines this year.
</P>
<P>
According to SEPA, the major polluters of sulfur dioxide are
found in high sulfur coal production areas in Guizhou, Guangxi,
Liaoning, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Shaanxi, Gansu and
Yunnan.

<HEADLINE> Senior Party Official Urges to Boost Township-Level Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing has urged Party
committees and governments at all levels to promote the building
of a clean government by opening up government activities at the
township level.
</P>
<P>
Wei, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, made the call
at today's national teleconference on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The opening-up of government activities to public supervision
is an important part of strengthening socialist democratic
politics, improving the work of administrative bodies, and
strengthening supervision over government powers, said the senior
Party official.
</P>
<P>
Wei said that the opening-up of government activities at the
township level should focus on the following issues:
</P>
<P>
-- Issues that are mostly cared by the people.
</P>
<P>
-- Putting government activities under the supervision of the
broad masses to ensure that the government becomes more honest and
fair.
</P>
<P>
-- Opening up the activities of both township-level governments
and the agencies of higher-level authorities stationed at township-
level governments.
</P>
<P>
-- Integrating the opening-up of township-level government
activities with that of the activities of village leaders.
</P>
<P>
-- Integrating the opening-up of township-level government
activities with the building of township-level Party organizations.
</P>
<P>
Wei also urged governments at county, prefecture, city and
provincial levels with good conditions to open up their
administrative activities to public supervision.

<HEADLINE> HK Holds Forum to Review "One Country, Two Systems" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Elsie Leung, secretary for
justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), said
here Tuesday that the central government has been firmly adhering
to the "one country, two systems" principle since the
establishment of the SAR and rendered full trust to the chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law is the backbone of Hong Kong's legal system since
July 1, 1997, and comprises Hong Kong's legal system along with
other laws like the common law, equity law and ordinances, said
Leung when she delivered a speech at a forum to review the three-
year experience since Hong Kong's return to the motherland and the
implementation of the Basic Law. Some Hong Kong members of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference attended the forum.
</P>
<P>
Leung said the Basic Law carries out the long-term policy of
the central government toward Hong Kong and its former legal
system has been taken full into consideration when the Basic Law
was being formulated.
</P>
<P>
She noted, "We all cherish the principle of the common law, but
the law must adapt the times, and get amendments in accordance
with the society. The legal system of the Hong Kong SAR must keep
going forward to maintain its vitality."
</P>
<P>
She said local and foreign communities came to accept the new
constitutional system of Hong Kong and understand the significance
of Hong Kong's return to China, with the development of some cases.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's legal status has not only won positive recognition
by foreign courts, some retired judges and foreigners working in
Hong Kong have also became confident about the rule of law in Hong
Kong since its return to China, Leung said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong witnessed a sound implementation of the Basic Law in
the past three years in spite of some difficulties and hardships,
she said, but there is nothing complacent for the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
She said the SAR government has been increasing communications
with the mainland and trying to make a better society for Hong
Kong with the joint efforts of the community.

Guangzhou and Dongguan and two gas-fired power plants in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The LNG terminal and pipeline project will cost around five
billion yuan (about 600 million U.S. dollars). The Chinese side
will take up a majority share of 70 percent with the rest going to
foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side comprises of the China National Offshore Oil
Corporation, the Shenzhen Investment Holding Corporation, the
Guangdong Electric Power Holding Company, the Guangzhou Gas

<TEXT>
<P>
In his closing remarks at the final session of the two-day 33rd
ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM), the Thai foreign minister said, "
in addition to being able to relate to the progress of the last
thirty-plus years, we are a firm believer in looking forward, in
being dynamic and pro-active."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the ministers from 10 ASEAN members

forward for the next few decades, Surin, chairman of current AMM,
added.
</P>
<P>
These include the grouping's common plans for ASEAN+3
cooperation (China, Japan and Republic of Korea), efforts towards
promoting human resources and ASEAN-Mekong Basin Development
Cooperation, as well as enhancing information technology
cooperation among member countries, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
It is most important for the 33rd AMM, he noted, that all the

but in the activities that member countries could undertake for
mutual interests.
</P>

The ministers have consented to convene more informal retreats
as and when necessary so as to be able to exchange notes in an
informal and frank manner, he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Largest State-Owned Life Insurer to Embrace Diversified Ownership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China Life, the largest solely
stated-owned life insurer in China, is to start a bold experiment
later this year to transform itself into a share-holding firm,
according to a top company official.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xianzhang, the general manager of China Life, told a
company conference that the reform will see new personnel which
will greatly enhance the firm's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Though industrial sources said listing of insurance firms is
still a long way away, insurance firms are already gearing up for
that day.
</P>
<P>
According to well-informed sources, the People's Insurance
Company of China (PICC), another major state-owned insurer, has
also started feasibility studies for diversified ownership reform.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said such reforms will enhance the firms financial
strength, improve their corporate structure and sharpen their
competitiveness as China will further open its insurance market
after it becomes a WTO member.

<HEADLINE> China to Set Up New Fiscal System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China plans to set up a new public
fiscal system within 3 to 5 years, Finance Minister Xiang
Huaicheng said here today.
</P>
<P>
He told a national work meeting on finance that in the next few
years governments at all levels will stop allocating budget funds
to projects in trades that should be ruled by market competition.
They will also stop funding operations, development and research
projects of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government will gradually reduce subsidies for
loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs), reimburse taxes paid
by enterprises, reduce funds allocated directly to SOEs and
provide tax incentives for enterprises in trouble.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said the government will try its best to make
breakthroughs in fiscal reform across China in the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
He noted that poor fiscal expenditure management has created
mounting pressure on the national budget in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will put all fiscal revenue in the
accounts of the treasury and allocate funds for fiscal expenditure
directly from these accounts. It will prohibit other governmental
departments and local authorities to hold fiscal revenue accounts,
according to Xiang.
</P>
<P>
Xiang said that the country will require various government
departments to draft their own separate budgets. China will allow
more government departments to do this on an experimental basis in
the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
From the beginning of next year, all departments that draft
their own budgets will be required to make detailed budget
procurement plans for the year.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Budget Fund for Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China will greatly increase the
proportion of funds for social security in budgetary expenditures,
Minister of Finance Xiang Huaicheng said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the national work meeting on finance, Xiang said
that China will focus on providing adequate funding for social
security purposes as part of the reform of the fiscal system in
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Budgetary expenditures for social security purposes jumped
almost twice in the first half of this year over the same last
year period, said Xiang. He didn't reveal the actual figure of
spending on social security.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is planning to expand social security funds
by imposing social security tax, sell part of government shares in
state-owned enterprises, and increase the issuance of lottery
tickets.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Ministry of Finance is cooperating with other
government departments to work out a complete funding program for
the fledging social security system. The ministry is also working
with other departments to implement social welfare payment
standards and strengthen expenditure management and supervision.

<HEADLINE> Water Pollution of Key Rivers, Lakes Under Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Water pollution in the Huaihe,
Haihe, Liaohe rivers and Taihu, Dianchi and Chaohu lakes is under
control.
</P>
<P>
Water of many reaches of the rivers and lakes has been improved,
but contamination in the rivers' main branches and some lakes is
still serious, according to sources with the State Environmental
Protection Administration (SEPA).
</P>
<P>
Pollution control in the three rivers and three lakes were
given top priority by the Chinese government from 1996 to 2000.
The chemical oxygen depletion (COD) substances of the rivers and
lakes decreased 834,000 tons, compared to 1995, a SEPA official
said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,540 enterprises, each pouring 100 tons of sewage
daily, have made efforts to curb pollution. Another 1,073
enterprises have stopped production, have been bankrupted or
closed down.
</P>
<P>
However, no pollution control measures have been taken in 130
firms along the Haihe River and Liaohe River yet.
</P>
<P>
According to China's environmental plan, 284 urban sewage
treatment factories should be set up in the vicinity of the three
rivers and three lakes by the end of the year. Now 28 sewage
plants are operational and 128 are under construction.
</P>
<P>
SEPA will strengthen the administration of industrial-pollution
enterprises, accelerate the building of urban sewage plants and
make further efforts to protect the environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A high-profile international
symposium on intellectual property (IP) which started today in
Beijing will focus on setting up an effective system for
protecting IP in China.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 delegates from governmental bodies, companies and
institutions are participating the two-day meeting, jointly
organized by China's State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO) and
the European Patent Office (EPO).
</P>
<P>
Topics of the symposium, titled "Protecting Intellectual
Property in China Challenges and Opportunities in the 21st Century
", include relations between IP and global trade, advanced
technologies, e-commerce, traditional cultures, trademarks,
business secrets, and law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Ying, commissioner of SIPO, said that China must improve
its legislative procedures and law enforcement in the IP to
safeguard the legitimate rights of IP owners.
</P>
<P>
She also urged nationwide companies and academic institutions
to effectively use patents and other protection forms for their
newly-invented technologies and products.
</P>
<P>
Ingo Kober, president of the EPO, appraised China's great
progress in IP protection in the past decades. He said he hopes
that there would be more exchange and cooperation in the field.
</P>
<P>
The symposium is an important part of the European Union-China
Intellectual Property Rights Cooperation Program. The EU decided
to inject 4.8 million Euros into the program to help train IP
lawyers, judges and researchers in China.

<HEADLINE> Israel Must Evacuate Jewish Neighborhoods in East Jerusalem: A- Sanna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Arab lawmaker Taleb A-
Sanna said on Tuesday that Israel must evacuate the Jewish
neighborhoods in East Jerusalem as part of the settlement of the
Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
East Jerusalem and the rights of return of the Palestinians are
of utmost importance to the Palestinians and that they are non-
negotiable, A-Sanna, Knesset (parliament) member of the five-seat
United Arab List, told the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
A-Sanna said that the Israeli Arab Knesset members support the
ongoing Camp David summit, but "will not automatically support any
agreement" Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak signs with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat at the summit.
</P>
<P>
"There is a limit to concessions, and we also have red lines
that we will not cross," he said, adding that at the summit "Barak
is trying to squeeze further concessions from Arafat, but he must
realize that in doing so he is losing support from the left."
</P>
<P>
A-Sanna said there is a need for a "just" agreement, and not one
made by taking advantage of Arafat's weakness and affinity for
peace.
</P>
<P>
The fate of Jerusalem is one of the key issues being discussed
at the summit, which entered its 15th day on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Barak reportedly suggested at the summit that Israel will have
total sovereignty over Jerusalem, giving the Palestinians autonomy
over the Old City and other Palestinian neighborhoods and holy
sites in East Jerusalem. But this proposal was rejected by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Washington said that Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators, with the help of U.S. officials, are trying to put
together a package of agreements to reach a final settlement of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with the key to a deal being
resolving the status of Jerusalem, holy city ot Jews, Muslims and
Christians.
</P>
<P>
Other key issues need to be settled at the summit are the size
and powers of a Palestinian state, the treatment of Palestinian
refugees, Jewish settlements on the occupied territories and
security arrangement.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Continues Weaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
slightly weaker Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the close, the Australian dollar was at 58.54 U.S. cents,
from 58.74 at the end on the previous day.
</P>
<P>
The unit peaked at 58.57 U.S. cents and reached a low of 58.28.
</P>
<P>
The market also is a little bit wary of ahead of Wednesday's
domestic June quarter consumer price index data.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict the June CPI could show a quarterly increase
of between 0.6 and 0.9 percent, for a year-on-year rate of between
3.0 and 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
That would put inflation beyond the Reserve Bank's annual
target rate band of between two and three per cent for the first
time since June 1996. But analysts said it would not result in an
interest rates rise. If official Australian interest rates
increased from 6.0 per cent, the differential with the U.S. would
narrow, which would likely strengthen the domestic currency.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military, Police Urged to Take Legal Action Against Islamic Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister Juwono
Sudarsono urged here Tuesday the country's military (TNI) and
police (Polri) to send back members of the Islamic militants group
or so called the Jihad Force from Maluku and North Maluku
provinces in a bid to end the conflict there.
</P>
<P>
legal action should be taken against those who resist to be
withdrawn from the riot-torn of the two provinces, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Sudarsono also asked the TNI and Polri to take firm "but wise"
measures in returning home the members of Jihad Force from Maluku,
saying no armed groups but the TNI and Police is allowed to stay
there.
</P>
<P>
Following a protracted communal bloodshed involving Muslims and
Christians in the spice island since early last year, the Jihad
Force sent their members to the provinces in May this year in what
it said as "a bid to protecting Muslims."
</P>
<P>
The situation has been worsen since the Muslim militants came
to Maluku and the clashes increased sharply during which more than
200 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, local military commander, Brig. Gen. I Made Yasa also
said that some 1,900 members of the Jihad Force will be deported
from the two provinces in a bid to restore order and peace in the
conflict area.
</P>
<P>
They will be sent back to Java by Hercules airplane and by ship.
</P>
<P>
But Ayip Syafruddin, chairman of the Islamic movement group of
Ahlus Sunnah Waljama'ah, has indicated that the members of Jihad
would resist any attempts to deport them from Maluku, and
threatening to fight their war in Java and Sumatra if they were
barred from protecting their Muslims brothers.
</P>
<P>
In further development, another report said that the military
has been preparing its Landing Ship Tank to deport the members of
Jihad to Java.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of peoples have been killed in the communal bloodshed
in the two provinces since it broke out early last year. The
central government has been hammering out a plan to put an end to
the bloodshed by imposing civilian emergency and a curfew.
</P>
<P>
But there is still no sign that the worst communal bloodshed
ever happened in the country will die down.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Promote a Comprehensive Development Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) will promote a more comprehensive development
agenda to prepare the region for globalization, enhance the region
's economic competitiveness and create more people-centered
societies, said its foreign ministers Tuesday in a joint
communique at the end of their annual meeting here.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day 33rd ASEAN Ministerial Meeting, the foreign
ministers of 10 ASEAN members discussed the main elements of a
more comprehensive development agenda, including augmenting the
process of greater outreach to the people, enhancing ASEAN's
economic integration and advancing the development of ASEAN "as a
concert of nations."  The foreign ministers agreed
that the overall security environment in the Southeast Asian
region remains stable and peaceful despite the existence of
certain challenges, approving the constitution of the ASEAN "
Troika" -- a decision-making group to take the lead in dealing
with issues of the region.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that it was particularly important for the major
powers to work together with countries of Asia-Pacific to further
enhance peace, stability and prosperity of the region.

While commending Indonesia for all its efforts in resolving the
East Timor issue, the ministers also reiterated their continuing
support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN ministers reaffirmed their "One China" policy and
expressed the hope to see positive developments on the cross-
strait relations.
</P>
<P>
They welcomed the commitment of all parties concerned to
resolving disputes in the South China Sea by peaceful means in
accordance with the recognized principles of international law as
well as to ensure the freedom of navigation in the area.
</P>
<P>
They added in the communique that they were gratified by the
steady momentum of East Asian cooperation within the context of
the ASEAN+3 forum involving China, Japan and the Republic of Korea.
They considered this forum as a significant contribution to the
political and economic stability of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
They also welcomed the continued strengthening of economic
recovery in the region, noting that advancement of ASEAN's
economic integration will serve to underline the comprehensive and
steady integration of the ASEAN economies into a combined market
of over 500 million people.
</P>
<P>
They renewed the ASEAN's call for a wider participation of
developing countries in the reform of the international financial
architecture as well as the urgency in the implementation of the

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's MPR Annual Session not to Unseat Wahid: Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Peoples
Consultative Assembly (MPR), the country's highest law-making body,
Amien Rais said here Tuesday that the annual session of the
assembly in August will not turn a special session which some
people proposed to unseat the incumbent President Abdurrahman
Wahid.
</P>
<P>
Rais made the statement amid rising worry about the annual
session of the Assembly will be used by Wahid political opponents
in the Assembly to unseat the incumbent president.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that the annual session will not turn into a special
session, as such a special session is not included in the agenda.
There is no window or gate to enable us to enter the special
session," Rais told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The MPR is scheduled to hold its annual session on August 7-18,
during which Wahid is expected to appear before the session to
account for his nine-month in office.
</P>
<P>
Wahid himself seems to have been facing troubles following his
unharmony relation with the country's parliament due to his
refusal on motion for interpellation last week which triggered
angry and disappointments among parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
Based on the country's constitution, members of the parliament
are all at once the Assembly's members.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, albeit Wahid finally sent an apology to the
parliament over the show-down, scores of parliamentarians intended
to file another motion against Wahid.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Shilling Gains as Hope for Aid Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya shilling has continued
to strengthen as hopes for aid resumption increased when the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) is to discuss the matter on
Thursday, the People daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The currency closed at 75.35 shillings to the U.S. dollar on
Monday after opening at 75.76 shillings earlier in the morning,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Central Bank chief Micah Cheserem said Monday that the
country badly needed an IMF loan to improve its economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
"The approval of the IMF loan facility will release much-needed
financial resources from the World Bank and other donors," said
Cheserem.
</P>
<P>
The IMF board is due to meet in Washington on Thursday to
discuss the possibility of resuming aid for Kenya's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign exchange dealers said that speculators were fairly
optimistic that Kenya would receive both the IMF and World Bank
funding.
</P>
<P>
The shilling depreciated to a historic low of 78 shillings to
the dollar in June, immediately after Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi appealed for a 150-million-U.S. dollar drought relief from the
international community.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, S. Africa to Expand Trade, Investment Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and South Africa
have agreed to extend trade and investment links beyond their
memorandum of understanding on trade and investment cooperation
signed in 1998, newspapers reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minster for Industry and Trade Iddi Simba met his
South African counterpart Eric Erwin here on Monday to identify
new projects for consideration in the extended cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The projects include the establishment of a brewery plant, a
fertilizer plant and several fruit canning plants, and large-scale
farming and horticulture cooperation in various regions of
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed during the meeting that they should address
bilateral investment treaty, avoiding double taxation according to
international norms advocated by the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique issued after the meeting said the ministers
saw the need to facilitate trade between the two countries,
especially promoting Tanzanian exports to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania imported goods worth 1.2 billion Rand (about 172.66
million U.S. dollars) from South Africa last year while it
exported only about 40 million Rand (5.8 million U.S. dollars)
worth of goods to Pretoria, the Tanzanian minister was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the deficit, there is a huge South African
investment in Tanzania in sectors such as breweries, mining and
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, the South African minister said
attracting more investment in Tanzania could lessen the deficit in
bilateral trade, adding that South Africa has a large industrial
economy that could invest in Tanzania and increase economic
projects.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Peace Talks Continue in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The peace talks between Colombian
government representatives and members of the country's second
largest rebel group, which were aimed at ending the country's 36-
year civil war, went into the second day in Geneva on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the first day of the talks, Franz von Daniken of the
host country's foreign ministry described the meeting as a "
historic moment for all those who believe in the possibility of a
just peace in Colombia," according to Swiss Radio International.
</P>
<P>
Swiss officials intend to remain on the sidelines throughout
the negotiations, leaving the Colombian government and the rebel
National Liberation Army (ELN) to hammer out a deal aimed at
ending Latin America's longest-running civil war.
</P>
<P>
But the Colombian authorities have said they may ask the Swiss
to mediate between government envoys and the rebels, if the talks
run into difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Von Daniken said the aim of the meeting was to "begin to build
mutual confidence after nearly 40 years of conflict."
</P>
<P>
The two sides are trying to agree on a plan to create a
demilitarized ELN enclave in northern Colombia, where the
guerrillas want to host a national peace convention.
</P>
<P>
The idea is to turn San Pablo and two neighboring counties
along Colombia's main river, the Magdalena, into a guerrilla safe
haven.
</P>
<P>
Around 80 people are taking part in the talks, including envoys
from Norway, Spain and Cuba. Colombian religious and civic leaders
are scheduled to attend as well.
</P>
<P>
The talks with the 5,000-member ELN are going ahead without the
participation of Colombia's most powerful rebel group, the 15,000-
strong Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).
</P>
<P>
The government in Bogota has been holding separate peace
negotiations with FARC leaders for the past 19 months.
</P>
<P>
Among those representing the ELN at the Geneva talks are two
guerrilla leaders, Francisco Galan and Felipe Torres, who are
currently serving prison terms for sedition, terrorism and
kidnapping but were released temporarily so they can participate
in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Colombia's 36-year civil war is estimated to have claimed the
lives of 120,000 people. The United Nations refugee agency
estimates that over 2 million people have been displaced by the
fighting.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Tuesday that it will consider "appropriate measures" if Fiji
rebels do not fulfill the conditions put forward by the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU said it "deplores the deposing of President (Kamisese)
Mara and the replacement of Mr. (Mahendra) Chaudhry's
democratically elected government and is outraged by the repeal of
the 1991 Constitution."
</P>
<P>
While welcoming the safe release of all the hostages, the EU
said it remains concerned at the development of the situation in
Fiji, "which is still unconstitutional, unstable and precarious."
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European bloc said it is essential that the rule
of law be restored and that the political rights of all elements
of the Fijian nation be respected on the basis of a "democratic
constitution and a government elected democratically."
</P>
<P>
"The European Union will consider appropriate measures if these
conditions are not fulfilled as soon as possible and may well be
obliged to review its policy towards Fiji, particularly as regards
development cooperation - should the democratic rule of law not be
restored," the bloc said in a presidency declaration.
</P>
<P>
The current holder of the six-month EU rotating presidency is
France, which started from July 1.

According to press reports, Osoro was shot in the neck Sunday
night in Nakuru in central Kenya. Police chief Andrew Kimeto said
the police had not recovered the car or made any arrests.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately possible to determine Osoro's condition,
but he spoke to local reporters from his hospital bed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Osoro told the East African Standard he hoped to recover in
time for the Olympic Games in September. But it couldn't
immediately be confirmed with officials of the Kenya Amateur
Athletics Association whether he would be on the 38-member team
that will travel to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Osoro was shot after he refused to hand
over his Toyota Land Cruiser keys to three armed carjackers.
</P>
<P>
His pregnant wife and 4-year-old daughter, who were held
hostage and later abandoned by the carjackers, were also admitted
to hospital for observation, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The KAAA named Osoro, Eric Wainaina and Kennedy Cheruiyot to
the marathon team July 22 at the end of the Olympic trials to
replace Boston Marathon champion Elijah Lagat, Moses Tanui and
Japheth Kosgei, whom KAAA secretary-general David Okeyo said had
been removed because they have not been training seriously for the
Games.

<HEADLINE> China's Artillery Modernized in 50 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Artillery and Antiaircraft
Forces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), founded on
August 1, 1950, has been developed into a high-tech armed force,
according to the General Staff of the PLA.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five decades, the PLA Artillery and Anti-aircraft
Forces have built up its ground cannon troops, ground-to-ground
missile troops, anti-aircraft artillery troops, and ground-to-air
missile troops.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, the Artillery and Anti-aircraft Forces
accelerated its modernization drive by replacing its artificial
commanding system with an automated commanding network.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the artillery and anti-aircraft troops digitized and
automated their targets, information-processing and firing of the
guns.
</P>
<P>
Chinese artillery and anti-aircraft troops had most of their
weapons imported. But now most of their equipment is designed and
manufactured by the Chinese military industry.
</P>
<P>
These troops are equipped with rocket guns, anti-tank guns,
ground-to-ground missiles, anti-aircraft guns, and ground-to-air
missiles. Troops have built up a complete training system
including a number of military schools..
</P>
<P>
Last year, the military ordinance on the fourth generation
artillery and anti-aircraft troops was issued to provide a legal
base for the training of PLA troops.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Improvement of Product Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The latest sample examination by
the State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision showed that
the qualification rate of China-made products was 78.9 percent, a
little lower than the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
Among the checked 2,240 varieties of products made and sold by
1,934 enterprises across China, 1,767 products received the tick
of approval.
</P>
<P>
Most of the quality problems were found in small-sized, private
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The spot-check also covered products important to people's
health and property. Only 70.3 percent of these products were up
to national standards.
</P>
<P>
An official from the bureau pointed out that the product
quality of some of China's key industries lags behind the rest of
the world. Poor administration was cited as the major reason for
low quality.
</P>
<P>
Local quality and technical supervision departments are being
urged to strengthen the inspection of inferior and shoddy products.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Slams Camp David Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
has lashed out at the Middle East peace talks now under way at Camp
David in Maryland, the United States, saying the talks are doomed
to fail.
</P>
<P>
Any solution to the Middle East crisis without taking into
account its roots is doomed to fail, Khatami said in a statement,
quoted by the official IRNA news agency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are continuing their
marathon talks at Camp David in the 15th day, without any visible
breakthrough on the toughest issues of Jerusalem and Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said the Middle East conflict was one of the most
important crises in the past half century and it stemmed from
Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands, which has resulted in the
mass exodus of Palestinians, who are the principal target of
recurring damage.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jerusalem, currently under Israeli occupation,
belongs to the Palestinians and it must be returned to them.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Jerusalem is not purely a Palestinian-Israeli
dispute, he said, it is up to all Muslims to strive for its
liberation because Jerusalem has an exalted status among Islamic
states.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also has
condemned the U.S.-brokered talks between Israel and Palestinians,
saying any Palestinian compromise with Israel would fail because of
resistance by radical Palestinian groups.
</P>
<P>
"While the flag of struggle and resistance flies, the line of
compromise is doomed to fail," Khamenei has said.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which refuses to recognize Israel, is opposed to the
Middle East peace process and has always called for armed struggles
to end Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Should Be "Active Player" in Mideast Peace: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- As the U.S.-brokered Camp David
talks between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat enter the third week, the Turkish
intelligentsia is asking the government to play an "active" role in
the talks, as well as the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Some scholars criticized Ankara for its lack of initiatives in
Mideast peace and cooperation, saying that Turkey has never been "
an active player" in the region and always kept "a low profile" in
the peace talks, local press reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They said Turkey, which is what they call "the successor of the
Ottoman Empire which ruled the Middle East for almost 400 years,"
should have played "a more active role" in the region and its peace
process.
</P>
<P>
But they have also found some reasons for the lack of
initiatives on the part of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ankara University's Professor Hasan Koni said Turkey does not
have necessary institutions and resources which would enable it to
learn the region and create policies accordingly on most of the
strategic issues around the region.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, "it is natural that we see a low-profile
Turkey in the Mideast peace process."
</P>
<P>
Ali Nihat Ozcan, professor of a Turkish think tank Center for
Eurasian Strategic Studies, said that since World War II, Turkey
has pursued a Mideast policy which closely follows the step of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that despite its reluctance, developments are
pushing Turkey to be an active player.
</P>
<P>
"A regional water settlement cannot be reached without Turkey's
participation. Even if Turkey does not want to be in the process,
Turkish assets are haggled over during these peace talks," Ozcan
said.
</P>
<P>
Ilnur Cevik, editor-in-chief of Turkish Daily News, said "we are
clearly in a unique position to make valuable contributions to
bridge the gap between the two sides as the relatives and religious
brothers of the Palestinians and the friends and partners of the
Israelis."
</P>
<P>
Turkey was one of the first Muslim countries to recognize Israel
in 1948. Since the 1990s, the two countries have become close
allies in the military field, which has invited condemnation from
the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
Cevik was dissatisfied with an atmosphere of indifference in
Ankara over the Mideast peace talks, saying that this issue is
not "outside our boundaries" because the failure or success of Camp
David talks would have a big impact on Turkey.
</P>
<P>
If the Camp David talks fail, potential turmoil, which means
that a collapse of the current relatively stable atmosphere and a
new era of instability, may engulf the Middle East, Cevik said.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that Turkey does have an important mission in the
Middle East and thus has to play an active role.

ANKARA -- Turkey has become a haven for compact disc (CD) and
video compact disc (VCD) piracy because it lacks effective
copyright laws, reported Turkish Daily News on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the past, pirated CDs and VCDs were smuggled from either
Bulgaria or Malaysia, but more recently they have begun to be
recorded from the Internet in Izmir and Istanbul, two largest
industrial and commercial centers in west Turkey. CD and VCD piracy
has boomed in the absence of strong laws.
</P>
<P>
A CD sells for 12 million Turkish Liras (about 20 U.S. dollars)
in music stores in Turkey, while pirated CDs can be bought at 3
million Turkish Liras (about 5 dollars.)
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Natural disasters may cost Turkey's Treasury a total
of 200 trillion Turkish Liras (about 300 million dollars) this
year, reported Turkish Daily News on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More and more farmers are expected to seek debt rescheduling as
a result of heavy foods, drought and heat waves in rural areas
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that some 140,000 hectares of farmlands have
been damaged and many animals killed.
</P>
<P>
The abnormally hot season has also severely damaged hazelnut
crop, a major foreign currency earner in the Black Sea regions.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Announces Comprehensive Plan for South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Economy and Trade Minister
Nasser Saidi has announced that the government had submitted a
comprehensive five-year plan to donor countries, appealing for 1.34
billion U.S. dollars to develop south Lebanon, Daily Star newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said at a news conference Monday that the south
Lebanon development plan is part of an overall 6.3-billion-dollar
development program for the country, which includes infrastructure
and human development projects.
</P>
<P>
According to Saidi, 991 million dollars will be allocated for
infrastructure; 150 million for small- and medium-sized economic
and agriculture projects; 191 million for rebuilding destroyed
homes and compensating the families of the wounded and detainees;
and 8.6 million for mine-clearing programs and mine-awareness
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Over 200 million dollars has already been contributed in grants
and loans for the five-year plan, the minister said. He estimated
that the cost of covering "basic and urgent" need would amount to
about 260 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
A donor countries meeting on Thursday will be presented by about
40 Arab and other foreign countries, including the U.S. and
European Union (EU). The EU can donate either as part of the EU or
as individuals.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is aimed to attract international money to help
develop south Lebanon after Israeli troops withdrew from the area
in late May after 22 years of occupation.
</P>
<P>
A follow-up conference is scheduled to be held in early October,
when donors will be asked to officially pledge the amounts they
would contribute.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Ruling Coalition Agrees to Set Up Visionary Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 25 (Xinhua) -- All the 14 component parties
of the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) (National Front) Tuesday
agreed on and supported the establishment of Visionary Schools in
an effort to strengthen relations between the various races in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Visionary Schools would accommodate three schools of
different media of instruction (Chinese, Tamil and Malay) in one
main campus using common facilities, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad who is also BN chairman said after chairing the BN supreme
council's general meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The BN comprises major political parties of Malay, Chinese and
Indian communities.
</P>
<P>
"This is one way of forging closer relations (between the
various races) while they are still young," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the common facilities would be the playing field,
assembly hall and the canteen.
</P>
<P>
The component parties are concerned about the activities going
on in the kindergartens where the feeling of hate is being sowed
by certain quarters, Mahathir said, adding the same situation is
also occurring at the school and university levels.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is trying its level best to overcome the
problem.
</P>
<P>
The government has, among other things, directed the Education
Ministry to place students of various races in accommodations
where they would share common facilities, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is crucial for the multi-racial communities to unite,
close ranks and establish relations between them such as
celebrating jointly the festivals of the diverse communities.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is a multi-racial country mainly comprising three
major communities -- Malay, Chinese and Indian.
</P>
<P>
Besides the national schools which are for all races, there are
also Chinese and Tamil national type primary schools in Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Welcomes G-8 Statement on Launch of New Trade Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- World Trade Organization (WTO)
Director-General Mike Moore has welcomed the statement from
leaders of the Group of Eight industrial countries that a round of
multilateral trade negotiations should commence this year.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement received here Tuesday, Moore said it was
vital for Canada, the European Union, Japan and the United States
to agree on the way forward in launching such a round, but he made
it very clear that agreement among the "Quad" is not sufficient
for a successful launch.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a splendid thing if we could launch a round this
year. I welcome the fact that such an important group of world
leaders has cast a spotlight on the importance of such
negotiations to the people of the world," the WTO chief said.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important step. But the WTO makes all of its
important decisions by consensus and while agreement on a package
of negotiations from the Group of Eight is welcome, there can be
no launch of talks without support from the world's developing
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there could be no trade round unless such
talks were supported by developing country governments and unless
more flexibility on difficult issues is shown by all sides.
</P>
<P>
A trade round, he added, offers the best way to ensure balanced
negotiations which reflect the interests and concerns of all WTO
members.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Regulates Financial Leasing Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China (PBOC),
China central bank, today issued rules governing financial leasing
companies.
</P>
<P>
A PBOC spokesman said the rules aim to promote the healthy
development of China's financial leasing industry and reinforce
the supervision and administration of financial leasing firms.
</P>
<P>
Financial leasing companies refer to nonbanking financial
institutions which operate financing and leasing businesses
approved by the PBOC.
</P>
<P>
A financial leasing company requires a minimum registered
capital of 500 million yuan (about 64 million U.S. dollars), and
those involved in foreign exchange businesses must have additional
foreign exchange capital of no less than 50 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
With approval from the PBOC, financial leasing companies can
set up branches, accept foreign investment, but are not allowed to
accept natural persons as shareholders.
</P>
<P>
The rules also provided detailed articles on the business scope
of financial leasing firms and metered out punishment for various
law-breaking practices.
</P>
<P>
China established its first financial leasing company in 1981
and the number rose to 15 by the end of 1999. These leasing
companies have aggregate assets worth 18.2 billion yuan, with an
accumulated business volume of 190 billion yuan.

BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China has achieved remarkable
achievements in helping people with disabilities, said Deng Pufang,
chairman of the China Welfare Fund for the Handicapped (CWFH),
here today.
</P>
<P>
About 1.7 million handicapped Chinese got various levels of
recovery in 1999 and 73.4 percent of disabled children were
enrolled at schools, Deng said, adding that compulsory education
inspection for disabled children was also listed in the "2000
education Inspection System".
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the achievements made for disabled Chinese at the
17th CWFH Conference, Deng said that social environment has
improved for the handicapped, and more healthy people are offering
help to the handicapped.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, about 260,000 urban disabled people found jobs and 58,
000 got vocational training.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of a basic security system for the
handicapped in 668 cities and 1,600 counties and townships, about
1.6 million handicapped people are receiving social welfare
benefits and 2.39 million disableds have been lifted out of

<HEADLINE> Chinese Enterprises Forced to Control Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- About 88.4 percent of China's 238,
000 industrial pollution makers met state standards by the end of
June after technical renovation, according to the State
Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) today.
</P>
<P>
According to an environmental protection decision made by the
State Council, all of China's industrial pollution makers must
meet the national or regional standard by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
So far, 78.9 percent of the 17,925 enterprises causing serious
pollution were tested qualified after improvement and 66 percent
of 620 China's key enterprises were up to standard.
</P>
<P>
The unqualified State key enterprises are mainly in
metallurgical, chemical, coal, non-ferrous metal and light
industry sectors.
</P>
<P>
SEPA official cited improper industrial structure, lack of
pollution control technology and money as the major difficulties
that large-sized State-owned enterprises are facing in controlling
pollution.
</P>
<P>
Among the 210 unqualified State key enterprises, 51.4 percent
need to reform and restructure their technology. Seventy-six
percent require more money to meet pollution control standards.
</P>
<P>
In the coming five months, SEPA and China's related departments
will tighten their inspection of industries of pollution. Those
with no hope of meeting State requirements will be forced to shut
down.
</P>
<P>
Other policies will be implemented to help large and medium-
sized enterprises solve their technological and money woes in
controlling pollution.

<HEADLINE> Iran Blames Foreign Nationals for Unemployment Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran, which is trying to create more
jobs for its young people, has blamed foreign nationals in the
country for the unemployment problem, according to a report in
Tuesday's Tehran Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The paper accused the foreign nationals, most of whom entered
Iran as refugees, of depriving Iranians of many job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Under Iran's third Five-Year Economic Development Plan (March
2000-March 2005), the Interior Ministry would repatriate foreign
nationals, mostly Afghan refugees fleeing the chronic civil war in
Afghanistan, to their homelands, an official at the Labor Ministry
announced.
</P>
<P>
Some 2.2 million foreign nationals are living in Iran, 1.2
million of them actively holding jobs, according to Habibollah
Ajayebi, who is in charge of employment affairs in the Labor
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Iran's current unemployment rate is 16.2 percent, with 2.8
million people seeking jobs, said the official, adding that another
720,000 young people are entering labor markets annually.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) concluded an accord in February to repatriate the Afghan
refugees.
</P>
<P>
So far as many as 50,000 Afghans have been repatriated "
voluntarily," according to a UNHCR report. In addition, 3,000 Iraqi
refugees have also been repatriated, a UNHCR official said.
</P>
<P>
Iran is to create 760,000 job opportunities annually in the next
five years to reduce unemployment rate to 12.2 percent. But during
the first two months of the current Iranian year starting March 20,
only 20,000 jobs were generated, Ajayebi said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Wraps up Turkey Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
concluded on Tuesday his three-day official visit to Turkey with a
string of agreements.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, who arrived in Turkey on Sunday heading a delegation,
held talks with his host President Ahmet Necdet Sezer and other
Turkish officials in Ankara on ways to boost bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Obasanjo and Sezer sealed two agreements, a
cooperation protocol and a mutual understanding document, which are
aimed at improving political relations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Turkish delegation raised the issue of buying
more natural gas and oil from the African oil-producing giant
during the meetings.
</P>
<P>
Turkey imports 4 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually
from Nigeria, but it wants more to meet the country's mounting
demand for energy.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian delegation expressed strong desire for Turkish
investments in various industrial sectors such as
telecommunications, road construction and mining.
</P>
<P>
In addition to political and economic aspects, a military
cooperation framework deal and a military training pact were signed
by Edip Baser, vice chairman of Turkish General Staff, and Nigerian
Defense Minister Modupe Adelaja.
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Turkey, Obasanjo made an appeal to the world's
richest nations to relieve the debt of the poorest countries, many
of which are in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Without such help developing countries can hardly get out of the
cycles of poverty and disease, warned the president of the most
populous African nation.

<HEADLINE> Jerusalem Not for Sale: UAE Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A major Arabic daily of the
United Arab Emirates said Tuesday there was no way for any
concession on Jerusalem to be made by the Palestinian negotiators
at the ongoing Camp David summit, which has now entered its 15th
day.
</P>
<P>
The Dubai-based Al Bayan said that with the return of United
States President Bill Clinton to the summit to continue his efforts
to ensure the success of the negotiations, there was an increasing
fear on the part of Arabs and Muslims all over the world over the
outcome of this summit regarding the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The paper cited as the source of these fears the alleged
mounting U.S. pressure on the Palestinian negotiators to accept the
U.S. proposal for a joint control over East Jerusalem, seized by
Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that whatever the motive behind the Americans'
efforts to see the success of the summit, "it remains clear that
Washington was making concerted efforts to contribute towards the
Judaization of Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
"Should the realization of President Clinton's personal
achievement at the end of his tenure and the saving of (Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud) Barak from his internal political crisis be at
the expense of Arab holy places and red lines?" the paper asked.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal on joint control of East Jerusalem, according
to the paper, would never make Arabs and Muslims forget their
history and root in that holy city and would never force them to
accept the status quo that was being imposed.
</P>
<P>
"What the Zionists (Israelis), supported by the Americans,
refused to realize is that forging historic realities would never
bring peace to the region. Jerusalem is not for sale," the paper
said.

<HEADLINE> UAE's Airline Orders Airbus A3XX </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates'
Emirates Airline has ordered the first A3XX superjumbo jets, giving
Europe's Airbus Consortium a major boost in ending its arch-rival
Boeing's monopoly in the world airplane market, the Gulf News
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The airline formally inked an agreement with Airbus Industrie
Monday to purchase seven A3XX aircraft, including two freighters,
valued at 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. It also announced options for
five more aircraft, the Dubai-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is reportedly the first that has been signed since
Airbus formally began offering the A3XX model, which is scheduled
to be launched by the end of this year once Airbus has signed firm
contracts with airlines.
</P>
<P>
The Emirates Airline will receive its first superjumbo in
February 2006 and the freighters from spring 2008.
</P>
<P>
The ordered 575-seat A3XX will be used to cope with passenger
and cargo growth on trunk routes from the airline's Dubai base to
London, Asia-Pacific and North America.
</P>
<P>
The A3XX is expected to first take wing in 2004, while first
deliveries are set to start in the final quarter of 2005. Nine
companies including the Emirates Airline have expressed interest in
buying over 500 the A3XX superjumbo jets, said the newspaper.

the traffic accidents in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung told the
conference that traffic accidents had become an urgent social
problem that should be tackled promptly.

strengthen State management efficiency in this field, promulgate
supplementary traffic safety rules, and promote the use of public
vehicles.

The Tarim River has for a long time irrigated the towns and
oasises in the river valley area, which is a major production base
of quality cotton, pears and apricots in China.
</P>
<P>
However, an investigation by the Xinjiang Ecological and
Geological Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences shows that some 80 percent of the poplar trees in the
area have died out due to water shortages and excessive lumbering
over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, a total of 33,333 hectares of forested
land were changed into farmland, according to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Now, all activities which may deteriorate local environment
have been prohibited in the area.
</P>
<P>
More over, the regional government has decided to turn 200,000
hectares of cotton fields back into forestry of fruit trees within
three years.
</P>
<P>
Government's efforts to harness the river has won strong
support from the public.
</P>
<P>
Forty-five-year-old Lu Xiaoshun, together with his wife and son,
have given up comfortable urban life and settled down in the
desert in the Tarim River valley. They have built houses and
started planting trees and grass.
</P>
<P>
Like Lu's, more than 70 families have also settled down in the
desert river valley for planting trees and grass, hoping to turn
the desert into a big green village.
</P>
<P>
Local government has adopted a series of measures to safeguard
local environment. These measures include encouraging local
farmers to use water-saving techniques, and restricting
development of new farmland to save water sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, activities stimulating people to donate money for
planting trees and grass in the region are also going on smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank and the Canadian Government have built ecology
protection projects in the Tarim River valley.
</P>
<P>
The Tarim River is expected to flow again into the Taitema Lake,
its original destination, by 2020, local officials said.

URUMQI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Many people have left their homes
in the area along the dry lower reaches of the Tarim River,
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, because the
river no longer provides them with water for their farmland and
daily life.
</P>
<P>
However, 95-year-old Ahmad Sayit of the Uygur nationality has
stayed there. His family and their 50 sheep have been relying on
well water to survive the serious drought.
</P>
<P>
Although there have been no water in the river course over the
past 20 years, Ahmad Sayit believes that some day the river course
will be full of water again, and everything there will be resumed
the same as it was decades ago.
</P>
<P>
He has become more confident as a project launched by the
Chinese government to divert water from nearby lakes into the
river course is now under full swing.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Sayit's is not the only family which stays there. Nine
other families are also waiting for the coming back of water.
</P>
<P>
The 1,321-kilometer-long Tarim River, the longest inland river
in China, runs from the west to the east along the northern verge
of the Taklimakan Desert, the biggest moving desert in the country,
and flows into the Taitema Lake in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Due to the sharp increase in water use on the upper and middle
reaches of the river, the river has become shorter and shorter. At
present, 320 kilometers of the river below the Daxihaizi Reservoir,
the current end of the river, has dried up.
</P>
<P>
Experts on water conservancy plan to divert water from the
Bosten Lake, China's biggest inland fresh water lake which is 580
kilometers away, first into the Daxihaizi Reservoir, and then into
the lower reaches of the Tarim River, said Zhang Fawang, director
of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional Bureau for Management of
Tarim River.
</P>
<P>
This project can water at least 100 kilometers of the lower
reaches of the Tarim River, according to an engineer from the
bureau.
</P>
<P>
Other projects, involving 200 million yuan (20.09 million US
dollars), will include building a 800-kilometer-long dyke and more
than 60 water gates along the middle reaches of the Tarim River.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xiangming, deputy director of the regional water
conservancy bureau, said the regional government is drafting a
program on harnessing the Tarim River. The plan, to be completed
within three years, covers ecological protection, development of
agriculture, animal husbandry and aquatic production, flood-proof
projects, water and soil conservation and utilization of water
energy. The total investment will be more than 2 billion yuan (240
million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> China to Build "Oriental Mecca" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Meizhou Island has a temple of Mazu and a sea goddess,
worshipped by more than 200 million people worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Although there are more than 4,000 Mazu temples in different
parts of the world, the Tianhou Temple on the island was built
first.
</P>
<P>
"We will invest heavily in the island so that it could become a
global Mazu culture research center and a pilgrimage center for
Mazu followers, or the Oriental Mecca," an official with the
municipal government of Putian said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the government and private investors have put
more than 600 million yuan in renovating the Tianhou Temple and
building 36 new temples, face-lifting facilities, and improving
roads, water supply systems, telephone lines and harbors, he told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Mazu, a legendary figure of the Song Dynasty (960-1279), was
born in Meizhou Bay. Her original was Lin Mo and the woman was
said to have saved a lot of lives from sea.
</P>
<P>
The government and businessmen plan to invest more than five
billion yuan (about 600 million U.S. dollars) by the year 2010 to
further refurbish temples and develop entertainment facilities on
beaches and mountains on the island.
</P>
<P>
The island, on the western side of the Taiwan Straits, was
traditionally inhibited by fishermen and military forces. It was
not opened to visitors until October of 1992.
</P>
<P>
Mazu is worshipped by people on both sides of the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
Recently, thousands of people from Taiwan held a traditional
ceremony on the island to worship Mazu. This is the second time
for Taiwan compatriots to come to the mainland to worship the
goddess since 1987.
</P>
<P>
In Taiwan, there are more than 800 Mazu temples with 16 million
followers.

<HEADLINE> China's Taxation Surges in first Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China's taxation revenue surged by
99.7 billion yuan over the same period last year to 597.3 billion
yuan in the first half of the year, accounting for 54 percent of
the targeted revenue for the year.
</P>
<P>
Jin Renqing, commissioner of the State Administration of
Taxation (SAT), told a national working meeting today that it was
the largest half-year increase of taxation in the past six years.
It was also the first time that China met the half-year target of
taxation revenue since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Jin said that annual growth of tax revenue has exceeded 100
billion yuan over the past six years. Despite the impact of
severe flooding and the Asian financial crisis, the country
managed to increase tax revenue by 100.3 billion yuan in 1998. It
boosted tax revenue further by 122 billion yuan in 1999, setting
an all-time high of over 1000 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Local economists say that the robust growth of taxation was due
to the improved economy and stricter measures adopted by Chinese
taxation authorities to prevent tax evasion.

BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The China State Power Corporation
(CSPC) expects to realize profits totaling 8.6 billion yuan this
year, remarkably more than the 1999 figure, said a senior power
official here today.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, China has given priority to
speeding up restructuring of the power industry and developing the
Three Gorges Power Grid, as well as the country's major provincial
power grids, said Jiang Shaojun, director in charge of the
corporation's strategic studies and planning.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country has made progress in transforming CSPC
into a giant corporation with more modern operating methods and a
shareholding system.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the country generated 1.16 trillion
kwh of electricity last year, up six percent from the previous
year, and earned 1.79 billion U.S. dollars in contracted overseas
investment, up 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
China expects to see an overall growth in the power sector this
year, said the official, adding that the country has made headway
in building and renovating 87 urban power grid projects and 1,590
rural ones.
</P>
<P>
China has effectively restructured its power industry by
closing a large number of small thermal power plants with high
coal consumption, heavy pollution, and poor economic efficiency.

BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua)-- Chinese citizens are allowed to
visit Japan at their own expense from September, according to a
recent Sino-Japanese agreement.
</P>
<P>
Japan thus becomes the seventh country that officially receives
Chinese tourists, following Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, the
Republic of Korea, Australia and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
At present, however, only residents in Beijing, Shanghai and
Guangdong are permitted to travel to Japan at their own expense.
</P>
<P>
The China National Tourism Administration (CNTA) will designate
21 travel agencies in the three places to host tourists to Japan,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The visa to Japan is for 15 days and remains effective for
three months. It will be issued by local Japanese embassies and
consulates. Each tour group should consist of at least five people,
but no more than 40.
</P>

An official from the China International Travel Service (CITS),
the country's largest travel agency, noted that Japan will be very
attractive for Chinese tourists, but travel cost in Japan is very
expensive.
</P>

"Even a bowl of noodle will cost about 60 to 70 yuan (about

important 60 points, Homeway analysts said, adding that the
advance was fueled in part by earnings reports showing significant
growth in the first half.

The most notable event was on the part of Shanghai Huili, which

Yaohua Glass also reported a net profit of 65.44 million yuan

</P>
<P>
The only slowing down was in Tire &AMP; Rubber with its half-year
losses more than twofold for a third consecutive term. The selling
in the share, however, was somehow alleviated by a formal
announcement of the company's 150 million US dollar-worth
agreement with Michelin &AMP; Cie SCA, Europe's No.1 tire maker today.
</P>
<P>
This report did help to resurface concerns about profit growth
and did see moderate selling, but the overall strength in the
market was largely intact.

Gainers outpaced losers by 46 to four today, with four

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are playing a
major role in the nationwide campaign to fight the notorious Falun
Gong cult and create greater public awareness about sciences in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Between April-June this year, the China Association for Science
and Technology (CAST) sent over 20 scientists to travel and
lecture across the country to educate people how to combat cults
with sciences.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, CAST has also continued sponsoring a series of
forums on safeguarding sciences which were inaugurated in 1995.
The seventh and eighth of the forums were held in Beijing in March
and June this year.
</P>
<P>
From March-April, CAST co-sponsored a project to promote
culture and ethics and a one-week photo exhibition encouraging
people to learn more about science and oppose superstition. The
exhibition attracted some 150,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
Since May, a large-scale program, including exhibitions,
seminars and contests have been launched by the Publicity
Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China, the Ministry of Science and Technology, and CAST.
</P>
<P>
This program, which is to last through until October, is aimed
at spreading the knowledge about science and strengthening the
public's ability to recognize and oppose superstition.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- As of Monday night, U.S. President Bill Clinton had not
convened a formal meeting with either Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak or Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, choosing instead to meet
with other delegation members in his cabin.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who rejoined the negotiations Sunday evening after a
four-day hiatus at the G-8 summit in Japan, met with negotiators
for five hours until 5 a.m.. The meeting, attended by CIA (Central
Intelligence Agency of the U.S) chief George Tenet, focused on
security issues and borders.
</P>
<P>
With the negotiations entering their 15th day, Clinton is
expected to announce either Tuesday or Wednesday whether the sides
are close enough to an agreement to proceed with the negotiations,
or if he believes a deal is unattainable in this round.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- In view of the highly contentious issue of sovereignty over
Jerusalem, U.S. President Bill Clinton will try to achieve a
partial agreement that will postpone the decision on this issue and
will also not include a declaration of "termination of the
conflict," an American source said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, Clinton got a green light from Barak
and Arafat to examinee the alternative of a partial accord.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this turn of events, the sides were locked in the idea
of "a comprehensive agreement or no agreement at all" and were
operating on the principle that "nothing is agreed until everything
is agreed."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- In his first address to the nation since his electoral defeat
more than a year ago, former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu
issued a strongly worded plea to the delegation at Camp David not
to make concessions on refugees, the Jordan Valley, and especially
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said, in a speech from his office that was broadcast
live on television Monday night, that he decided to speak directly
to the people at a time when negotiations at Camp David reached a
critical juncture, because he has "a deep feeling that the future
of the country is in danger."
</P>
<P>
He accused Barak of crossing all the red lines he had drawn
prior to the summit and giving in to unreasonable demands made by
Arafat. His speech was widely viewed as a sign he is returning to
politics.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations announced Monday that Israel has completed
its redeployment along the international border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is expected to begin
deployment along the border between Israel and Lebanon in the next
few days, thereby filling the vacuum left behind after Israel
withdrew from south Lebanon in May.
</P>
<P>
In two announcements published Monday in New York and Beirut,
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and the organization's
special envoy to the Middle East, Terje Roed-Larsen, confirmed that
Israel has withdrawn in full to the "blue line" which U.N.
cartography experts set as the international border between the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military to Deport Islamic Militants From Maluku </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Military (TNI) said
here that in a bid to stop communal bloodshed and restore peace
and order in the riot-torn provinces of Maluku and North Maluku
provinces, it will deport some 1,900 members of Islamic Militants
Group or so called the Laskar Jihad (Jihad Force), reports
reaching here Tuesday said.
</P>
<P>
Brig. Gen.I Made Yasa, commander of the Pattimura Regional
Military Command overseeing Maluku, was quoted as confirming that
at least 1,900 Jihad fighters were rounded up in Ambon, capital of
the Maluku province and its surrounding area. Meanwhile police
intelligence sources put the number of Jihad Force at 5,000.
</P>
<P>
Yasa said that the Jihad fighters will be sent back to Java by
Hercules airplane or by ship.
</P>
<P>
Following the protracted communal bloodshed in the country's
provinces of Maluku and North Maluku involving Muslims and
Christians since early last year, the Jihad Force In May this year
sent its members to the provinces in what it said as "an effort to
protecting Muslims". But violence has been rising and many people
have been killed since the Jihad Force came to the area.
</P>
<P>
Equipped by sharp weapons and hand-made riffles and ammunitions
as well, the Jihad Force arrived at the conflict areas, mostly
through the sea, couple months ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Maluku Police Chief Brig. Gen. Firman Gani said that
security forces had launched a massive sweeping operation in areas
identified as the base of "unwanted outsiders", a term used to
refer to members of the Jihad.
</P>
<P>
Gani also said that, "we will coordinate the deportation of
these groups with the military, especially the Navy and the Air
Force."
</P>
<P>
Separately, Ayip Syafruddin, chairman of the Ahlu Sunnah
Waljama'ah forum, one of Islamic movement groups in the country,
said that the Jihad fighters would resist any attempt to deport
them from Maluku and threatened to fight their war in Java and
Sumatra if they were barred from protecting their Muslims brothers
in Maluku.
</P>
<P>
Denying of being responsible for the recent clashes between
Muslims and Christians in Maluku, Syafruddin said that the members
were mostly conducting humanitarian missions to help refugees and
the sick.
</P>
<P>
Maluku and North Maluku provinces have witnessed a more than
one and a half year communal bloodshed involving Muslims and
Christians since January 1999.
</P>
<P>
The central government has refused any possible military
interventions from foreign countries in dealing with the bloodshed
while thousands of peoples from the two warring camps, including
security officers have been killed, while there is no sign that
the conflict will die down despite the imposition of civilian
emergency and curfew by the government at the end of June.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Rebels to Boycott Upcoming Talks With Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (
MILF) in the southern Philippines bared Tuesday that it would
boycott the July 29 peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
Moner Bajunaid, acting MILF chief negotiator, made this
announcement over a local radio station in Mindanao, saying that
the decision came following the recent meeting of the MILF's "
Central Committee" on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Bajunaid, however, said that the MILF leadership is still open
for discussion on the political solution of the Muslim problem in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
But Edgardo Batenga, government chief peace negotiator, said
the talks on July 29 would push through as agreed by the
Philippine-MILF peace panels.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the peace talks would push through with the MILF in
the context of the Constitution and the concept of substantive and
meaningful autonomy.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the MILF disclosed they would only take part in the
peace talks with the government provided the meeting be held in a
neutral country.
</P>
<P>
Bajunaid said the arrest warrants issued against MILF leaders
and panel members would endanger their lives considering the all-
out war policy of the administration.
</P>
<P>
But according to Batenga, the problem is internal and should
not be brought to other countries.
</P>
<P>
As this developed, the military bared that the MILF offensive
actions heated up in Central Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
According to Lito Aso, a military spokesman, the attacks
against military positions were in retaliation to the government
troops' capture of Camp Abubakar, the MILF's main stronghold in
Maguindanao earlier this month.

<P>
TOKYO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- A nuclear power reactor was shut
down in Tomioka, Fukushima Prefecture, northeast of Tokyo, after a
possible fuel leakage on Tuesday, the Kyodo news agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo Electric Power Co. was quoted as saying on Tuesday that
it shut down the 1.1 million-kilowatt reactor after a radiation

local time Tuesday (1800 GMT Monday), and staff at the plant
confirmed that the density of iodine in cooling water at the
reactor was increasing.

<P>
There might be a fuel leakage but there was no sign of
radioactivity leaking outside the plant, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
The electric company, which started to shut down the reactor
manually at 1 p.m. (0400 GMT), said the shutdown was necessary to

<HEADLINE> Former AUM Cult Member Sentenced to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Tokyo District Court on Tuesday
sentenced a former AUM Shinrikyo cult member to death on murder
charges.
</P>
<P>
Satoru Hashimoto, 33, was sentenced to death for his role in
the 1989 murder of an anti-AUM lawyer and his family, as well as
the 1994 sarin gas attack in Matsumoto, Nagano Prefecture. The
crimes left about 10 people dead and many more injured.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto also was convicted of preparation for murder for
building a sarin gas plant in Kamikuishiki, Yamanashi Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
He is the second sentenced by the court in the family's murder,
following Kazuaki Okazaki, 39, who was handed the sentence last
October and appealed it the following month.
</P>
<P>
Presiding Judge Toshio Nagai said that cult founder Shoko
Asahara ordered his subordinates, including Hashimoto, to murder
lawyer Tsutsumi Sakamoto, and contrived the 1994 sarin attack.
</P>
<P>
Asahara had feared more criticism against AUM by Sakamoto in
the public, according to a ruling by the court.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, six former AUM members were indicated on various
charges including murder.

<HEADLINE> China Starts to Drill 5,000-Meter Well for Geological Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- China has started drilling a 5,000-
meter well for geological information that can help deepen mankind
's understanding of basis earth science problems.
</P>
<P>
According to Science Times, a newspaper sponsored by the
Chinese Academy of Sciences, the continental scientific drilling
project has been listed as one of the nation's key science
projects between 1996 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
It is not only China's first but also Asia's first geological
continental deep drilling project, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Geologists have said the well is like a telescope that looks
deep inside of the earth, and that it will greatly help the
research of ocean and continental plate movement, crustal stress
and earthquake, vocano course, deep resources and the origin of
life.
</P>
<P>
The project, constructed by China Geological Investigation
Bureau, will be granted 150 million yuan (about 18 million US
dollars) and is expected to be completed in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The well will be drilled at a hard crystallization area and
requires high technology. Scientists will obtain bore core, liquid
and gas samples, and abstract various data from the samples to
study the formation of the lithosphere and explore mineral
resources.
</P>
<P>
So far, the deepest scientific drilling in the world is a well
of 12,262 meters in Russia, according to the newspaper.

air pollution today, with the highest pollutant indicator reading
at 128.
</P>
<P>
According to a daily air quality report issued by the China

</P>
<P>
Six cities, namely, Harbin, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Haikou, Kunming

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Attorney General to Probe May Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Attorney General
Marzuki Darusman has pledged that his office will launch a
comprehensive investigation into the May 1998 riots and set a one-
week deadline to the National Commission on Human Right (Komnas
HAM) to submit the report for further legal action, national
newspapers here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Darusman also said that the report from the government-
appointed team of the Joint Fact-Finding Team (TGPF) was eligible
to be considered a fact-finding report and deserved to be followed
up by the attorney general office (AGO).
</P>
<P>
"I think the final investigation can start in one week provided
that the commission submits the report to my office," Darusman was
quoted by the papers as saying.
</P>
<P>
On May 13-15 1998, the country saw the worst looting and
rioting in decades in Jakarta, Medan, Solo. It was believed that
more than 1,300 lives were claimed in the riots, while thousands
of buildings and vehicles were destroyed or set ablaze. The
rioters also conducted a wide-spread rape and torture on ethnic
Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
And just one week after the riots took place, Soeharto stepped
down from his presidential office and his successor, B.J. Habibie
then took office as the country's president until October last
year.
</P>
<P>
The TGPF earlier issued a report confirming that nearly 1,300
people were killed during the riots and 52 women were raped with
14 more falling victim to rape with violence, 10 to sexual attacks,
and nine to sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indonesian Ethnic Chinese Reforms Party (PARTI)
put the number of rape victims at 300, including a nine-year-old
girl. However, the party regretted that no victim is willing to
give testimony for fear of retaliation.
</P>
<P>
The TGPF then collected data confirming the tragedy from the
second-hand information.
</P>
<P>
After President Abdurrahman Wahid took office in October last
year, he decided to open a formal investigation into the alleged
rape, but like the previous inquiries which were based on the
second hand information, it uncovered scant evidence to support
the claims of sexual violence.
</P>
<P>
But Darusman asserted: "What's in the reports (of TGPF) is all
valid." "That is exactly what happened during the May riots," he
said, indicating that the human rights tribunal could be used as a
basis for a formal investigation by state prosecutors based on the
country's regulation No.1/1999.

</P>
<P>
Hu also met separately with Chairman of the People's
Consultative Assembly Amien Rais and Speaker of the House of
Representative Akbar Tanjung as well as people from the business
circle here.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Hu expressed the hope that the two countries
could continue maintaining close cooperation and mutual support in
safeguarding national sovereignty, territorial integrity and in
keeping off the external intervention.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that with concerted efforts of both sides, the
Sino-Indonesian good-neighborly and friendly relations and
cooperation will continue to make new progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at a luncheon given by the Indonesian business
circle, Hu called on Indonesian businessmen to do business
actively in China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government will also encourage Chinese
enterprises to invest in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, China and Indonesia signed a legal assistance
accord, namely "Treaty between the People's Republic of China and
the Republic of Indonesia on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal
Matters."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the third leg of Hu's five-nation tour. Before his

``The reduction of the staff will be started within a few

Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC).
</P>
<P>
The demining center spends about 13 million dollar a year to
support its work nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two years, foreign donors were reluctant to
provide further aid to CMAC after hearing corruption scandal in
the body. But lately, the audit has shown no loss of foreign fund,
except mismanagement in the body leading to a loss of some 75,000
dollars from the government's fund.
</P>
<P>
CMAC is the government organization, but 90 percent of its fund
is depending on foreign donations from Japan, Australia, Britain,
Sweden, Belgium and Netherlands, etc.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 4 million to 6 million land mines were
planted in Cambodia since 1967.
</P>
<P>
45,000 Cambodian amputees are caused by land mines.

<HEADLINE> Home Office Use of Internet Growing Dramatically in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The percentage of U.S. home
office PC households with Internet access soared to almost 81
percent by the end of 1999, up from just 26 percent at year-end of
1996, according to a report released Monday.
</P>
<P>
This percentage will continue to rise, approaching 92 percent
by the year 2004, said the report from U.S. market researcher
International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
IDC believes a number of factors are driving the increase in
Internet use, including the high availability of Internet-ready
PCs, which simplify going online.
</P>
<P>
"A small business operating out of the home, which in the past
was constrained by problems of logistics, can now easily establish
a global presence," said the report. "Corporate home offices are
using the Internet, sometimes instead of the telephone, to stay in
touch with their offices and customers, and income-generating home
offices are using it to create revenues."
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, the Internet applications that home offices
use most frequently, such as remote access to corporate data,
collaborative working and file sharing, are all bandwidth
intensive. As a result, the availability of high-speed Internet
access is of particular importance to work-at-home households, and
they have always been among the first to adopt broadband
technologies.
</P>
<P>
IDC predicts traditional dial-up method to remain the most
popular way for home offices to access the Internet through 2004.
However, this access method's dominance will steadily decline in
the coming years as more and more home offices turn to cable
modems and DSL.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Asks Military Leaders to Obey Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid has asked leaders of the country's military (TNI) to obey
his orders, while promising to increase the welfare of the
military personnel, leading national newspapers reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to immediately increasing TNI's welfare, and
in turn we ask the TNI to uphold its loyalty to the state, which
is represented by the government," Wahid was quoted by the Jakarta
Post as saying when addressing some 200 commanders of battalion of
the Army's Special Forces (Kopassus) and the Army's Strategic
Reserve Command (Kostrad) in Malang, East Java Province.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Wahid as saying: "You must obey your
commanders and your commander must obey the supreme commander, and
that is the president."
</P>
<P>
The president said: "I will not tolerate people in the military
who engage in conspiracies. Such people are not professional."
</P>
<P>
Wahid promised that the government would provide TNI with
proper equipment as soon as the country's battered economy
recovers.
</P>
<P>
"I hope there are no more grouping in the Army. I am not going
to listen to it," Wahid asserted, asking TNI to back the
government diplomatic efforts to deal with threats to the nation's
unity, such as the unity in Aceh, Irian Jaya and Maluku.
</P>
<P>
The call for the loyalty came amid show-down between Wahid and
the parliamentarians over his refusal to the motion for
interpellation last week. Although Wahid finally apologized to the
parliament over what happened in connection with his refusal,
scores of parliamentarians could not accept such an apology,
saying they will file another motion to the president.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Private Banks Take Action to Boost Ailing Capital Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and
representatives of different PCBs agreed on this point at a high-
level meeting held in the board room of the SEC Monday.
</P>
<P>
Manir Uddin Ahmed, chairman of the SEC, reviewed the present
market trend and informed the representatives of PCBs about the
steps taken by the SEC to strengthen the capital market.
</P>
<P>
In order to accelerate the participation of institutional
investors in the capital market, the meeting emphasized the need
to allow the PCBs to act as merchant bankers through a separate
wing in their respective banks instead of forming a separate
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
The meeting unanimously agreed to allow the merchant banking
wings of the commercial banks to make investment in their own
accounts and to invest in clients' accounts, taking prior consent
of their respective clients.
</P>
<P>
The meeting identified the absence of institutional investors
as a major factor behind the volatility of the capital market,
hoping that the market situation would improve significantly when
the commercial banks start merchant banking activities and play
the role of institutional investors as well.
</P>
<P>
Last week the U.S. dollar hit an all-time high of per dollar
against 55.90 Bangladesh taka in the free-floated market due to
high demand from Asian investors, travelers and traders, while it
remained steady in the official market at around 51 taka, leaving
a profit margin of five taka.
</P>
<P>
In order to tame the volatile capital market, the central
Bangladesh Bank has decided Monday to take tougher measures on
sales of foreign currencies to travelers by commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
According to the new provisions, a traveler will be required to
show his visa to the bank officials, along with his passport and
the confirmed air ticket if buying foreign currencies for the
purpose of travel.

<P>
Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the country's central bank, Monday
refixed the selling rate of 1 dollar to 71.35 rupees from 71.10
rupees, the official English daily Rising Nepal said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank had devaluated rupees from 69.7 rupees against 1
dollar to 71.10 rupees at the end of June.
</P>
<P>
The devaluation was done "to adjust the crossrate with Indian
Currency," Yubaraj Khatiwada, chief economic advisor at NRB, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali rupee is pegged to the Indian rupee at a fixed rate
of 1.6:1.
</P>
<P>
Although NRB took the depreciation in a light manner,
economists fear that it will have tremendous pressure on the
overall Nepali economy.
</P>
<P>
"The devaluation has multiplier effect to the entire Nepalese
economy and mounts pressure on the price, which in turn poses
negative impact on the trade," said Nidhi Sharma, an economist.

BERLIN -- The Deutsche Telekom AG, Europe's largest
telecommunication firm, Monday successfully entered the U.S.
market by taking over VoiceStream Wireless Corp. with 106 billion
marks (50.7 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Based in Bellevue, Washington state, the VoiceStream is the
eighth largest mobile service provider in the U.S. with 2.3
million subscribers and 8,200 employees.
</P>
<P>
Although its income in the first quarter of year 2000 grew by
280 percent to 256 million dollars, its loss also reached 203.3
million dollars during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Unlike most U.S. wireless telecommunication companies that use
CDMA or TDMA standards, the VoiceStream bases its network on GSM
standard, the most popular digital cellular standard in the world.
That makes it easily to dock with the network of Deutsche Telekom.

LOS ANGELES -- Strong consumer demand in the Far East drove
year-on-year worldwide PC unit growth of 14.5 percent in the
second quarter this year rising to 30.1 million units, while the U.
S. market expanded only 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary estimates released Monday, markets in
Asia-Pacific continued their strength as summer promotions in
China and affinity marketing programs in Australia expanded
consumer demand. High levels of consumer PC demand continued to
swell in the Japanese marketplace, which accounted for the highest
growth of all regions this quarter. Elsewhere, Latin America also
exhibited higher than worldwide market growth, benefiting from

<HEADLINE> Bush Selects Cheney as Presidential Running Mate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- George W. Bush, the likely U.S.
Republican presidential nominee made a decision Monday to choose
former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to be his running mate, local
press reports quoted highly placed Republican sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bush's spokeswoman Karen Hughes confirmed Monday that Bush had
already made his selection, but "he has not yet notified that
individual or told anyone else about his choice."
</P>
<P>
Bush is expected to release the offer Tuesday morning, while
Cheney has told his associates that he will accept it.
</P>
<P>
In his two decades of public service, Cheney served as
President Ford's chief of staff as well as a Congressman from
Wyoming for six terms. He also served as the Pentagon chief in
former President George Bush's government and masterminded the
Operation Desert Storm during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Cheney, currently CEO of Halliburton Co., will bring the
decision of Bush a wealth of foreign policy experience, which
Texas Governor Bush lacks himself, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
However, Cheney, 59, had suffered three heart attacks by age 48.
A doctor commissioned by the Bush campaign stated that his health
"should not interfere with a strenuous political campaign."
</P>
<P>
Cheney had been chosen by Bush to head his search for a
presidential running mate, but he emerged as the top candidate
himself Friday after he switched his voter registration from Texas
back to his home state of Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
Bush himself will be officially nominated as the Republican
presidential candidate at the party's national convention
scheduled to be held in Philadelphia from July 31 to August 3.

<HEADLINE> Study: U.S. Online Music Market to Shift to Subscription </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A study released Monday
indicated that online music sales in the United States are
expected to reach 5.4 billion U.S. dollars in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The majority of online music sales will come from subscription,
while individual downloads continue to be effective marketing
tools and entice people to make purchases, according to the study
conducted by Jupiter Communications, a U.S. research firm on
Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
The growth of music-sharing services, such as Napter, reveals
U.S. consumers are ready for making online subscriptions, which
will account for 980 million dollars in sales in 2005, compared
with an expected increase of individual music downloads to 531
million dollars in the same year, said the study.
</P>
<P>
Jupiter projects that the online music sector will occupy
approximately one-fourth of the total U.S. music market in five
years.
</P>

An earlier study by market research firm CyberDialogue also
found nearly 11 million online music fans in the United States
would be interested in paying a monthly subscription fee to
download their favorite tunes.

UNITED NATIONS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan told the Security Council Monday that Israel had ended all
violations of its border with Lebanon and that U.N. peacekeepers
would be soon deployed in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the President of the Security Council for the
current month, Patricia Durrant of Jamaica, Annan said, "Israel
authorities have removed all violations of the line of withdrawal.
"
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and Prime
Minister Selim al-Hoss had given their consent to the full
deployment of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL)
at a meeting today with U.N. Special Envoy on the Middle East
Terje Roed-Larsen.
</P>

"UNIFIL's deployment will take place on July 26 and is to be
immediately followed by the deployment of the composite Lebanese
unit," Annan said.

<HEADLINE> Dutchwoman De Bruijn Sets 100m Butterfly World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Dutch sprint star Inge de
Bruijn emerged from the obscurity of her Oregon training pool to
deliver a notice to the coming Olympic Games Saturday night by
setting a 100-meter butterfly world record of 56.64 seconds at the
Senior Long-course Championships in Federal Way, Washington.
</P>
<P>
That record swim came a night after she swam 54.01 in the 100-
meter freestyle, which was just .21 seconds short of her world
record of 53.80 and equaled the second-fastest time in the history
of the event.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch star broke the 50-meter freestyle world record she
shared with Chinese star Le Jingyi in June before a boisterous
crowd in Drachten, the Netherlands, on the final day of the Dutch
Swimming Championships.
</P>
<P>
De Bruijn, wearing the controversial Speedo "Fastskin" full-
body suit, recorded a 24.48, edging the previous mark of 24.51 set
by Le in Rome six years ago and equaled by the Dutch star this May
during her record flurry at a meet in Sheffield, England.
</P>
<P>
In a remarkable three-day performance at the relatively minor
event in Sheffield, de Bruijn broke three world records and tied
another. The second of the three unprecedented swims was the most
impressive, as de Bruijn clocked a time of 56.69 seconds in the
100-meter butterfly, obliterating Jenny Thompson's world standard
by 1.19 seconds.
</P>
<P>
When Thompson set the record in August 1999, she shaved .05 off
Mary T. Meagher's mark, which had stood for 18 years. A day after
eclipsing the 100 butterfly record, de Bruijn lowered the 100
freestyle from Le's 54.01 seconds to 53.80.
</P>
<P>
Also in Sheffield, de Bruijn matched Le's record in the 50 free
(24.51) and lowered her own mark in the non-Olympic 50 butterfly
to 25.64.
</P>
<P>
The recent string of great swims is the latest high in de
Bruijn's roller-coaster swimming career.
</P>
<P>
She qualified for the 1996 Olympic Games, but decided not to go
because she lost all motivation and desire to swim. Two months
before the Games, she seemed so disinterested that her coach,
Jacco Verhaeren, told her to stop coming to the pool.
</P>
<P>
De Bruijn, who admits she had a bad attitude, watched the
Atlanta Games on television and cried when she saw what were then
her two main events, the 100-meter freestyle and 100-meter
butterfly. De Bruijn, who finished ninth in the 100 fly at the
1992 Olympics, said staying home in 1996 was the biggest mistake
of her life.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen's Exports of Machinery and Electronics Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen's exports of machinery
and electronic products have increased considerably in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures show that Shenzhen exported a total of 16.63
billion U.S. dollars of machinery and electronics last year,
accounting for one fourth of the country's total exports in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
The figure made up one third of the overall exports of
machinery and electronic in Guangdong, said a local economic
official.
</P>
<P>
The official contributed the export increase to financial
support by the Import and Export Bank of China, one of the country
's three policy-oriented banks established in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Over the past six years, the bank has offered almost six
billion yuan (723 million US dollars) in loans to more than 20
machinery and electronics enterprises in Shenzhen.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bank Gives Tuition Loans to Poor College Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- With no guaranty attached,
tuition loans have been given to six poverty-stricken students
attending Normal College in southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality.
</P>
<P>
After signing loan contracts with the Chongqing branch of the
Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, the students will get their loan
money without assurance of financial warrantors.
</P>
<P>
The maximum sum of the seven-year loans is 40,000 yuan ( 4,800
US dollars), according to an official with the bank.
</P>
<P>
"It is the first time that a commercial bank has issued
education loans to college students," said Zou Yu, a university
official. Seventeen more students will sign similar loan contracts
with the bank soon, he added.
</P>
<P>
The students' loan applications were recommended to the bank
by the college based on their outstanding grades, good character,
credit history and health condition, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, only 100 college students obtained financial aid
from a national education loan program, which was established in
the same year with a total loan volume of 700 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
But those loans cannot be given to most of poor students
because they can't find loan warrantors, which the program
requires, according the bank official.
</P>
<P>
China's personal credit system is still in its infancy. If no
valid financial assurance and credit history is provided, banks
often hesitate to grant loans to individuals, he explained.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Travel agencies in China have shown
great interest in cooperating with tourist network providers.
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 300 networks catering to tourism have been
set up in China with millions of registered members.
</P>
<P>
The first tourist network was opened by Qiu Bojun, president of
the Beijing-based software company Kingsoft, after he experienced
frustration in finding a suitable hotel during a business tour. To
date, the website, www.xoyo.com., has 20,000 members and 2,000
institutional members who can make bookings and reservations for 1,
000 major hotels in 100 Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
"The Internet has built a bridge between tourists and travel
agencies," Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of E-travel services will bring about a
fundamental change to tourism as we know it, he added.
</P>
<P>
China has 70 million Internet users, 70 percent of which have
travel plans and can afford domestic and even overseas trips.
</P>
<P>
WWW. Chinagc. com, a E-travel agency, has 120,000 surfers a
day. The network president Shen Dongshu expects its annual
business turnover to be 10 billion yuan in three to five years.

<HEADLINE> Near-sightedness of Middle School Students Hereditary: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Results from a recent survey of
middle school students here show that nearly half are near-sighted
and their condition is largely hereditary.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted by six professors with the Children's
Hospital attached to the Medical University of Chongqing, China's
fourth municipality in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
The professors noted that the rate of near-sightedness among
the city's middle school students was 50 percent for those who
have one short-sighted parent, while the figure rose to 93 percent
when both parents were myopic.
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, following factors can cause myopia,
or short sight: poor eyesight of parents, inadequate indoor
lighting, posture while reading and writing, age when short sight
developed, and whether a person wears glasses after being
diagnosed with myopia.
</P>
<P>
The survey randomly sampled 1,008 middle school students in
the city, 505 of whom are boys, according the experts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cowherd Narrowly Escapes Death in Bear Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Wang Shijin, a 46-year-old
cowherd in Benxi, northeast China's Liaoning Province, narrowly
escaped death by playing possum when two black bears attacked him.
</P>
<P>
Wang came across the two black bears just 20 steps away when
looking for a missing cow in the woods early one June morning. He
was pushed to the ground by one of the bears and both sunk their
teeth into him. Then he remembered hearing once that bears leave
dead people untouched.
</P>
<P>
He lay motionless, holding his breath. The bears soon lost
interest and wandered away. When fellow herdsmen came to his
rescue, Wang was nearly dead.
</P>
<P>
Local surgeons removed Wang's seriously-damaged left eye.
Muscles in one thigh were torn to the bone, and his back was badly
mauled, they said.
</P>
<P>
The black bear is listed under second-class state protection,
according to a spokesman in Benxi Forestry Bureau. As the animal
seldom attacks human beings unless it senses danger, the two bears
who attacked Wang may have mistaken him for a hunter, he said.
</P>
<P>
There is no Chinese law to address cases of attacks and
injuries by state-protected animals.

BELGRADE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The international peacekeeping
force in Kosovo (KFOR) recently discovered four weapon caches
belonging to the former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), reported the
Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
The news agency quoted a KFOR communique Monday as saying that
the four caches of ammunition were found in the past three days by
British and Finnish peacekeeping forces in central and southern
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
KFOR discovered another four ammunition depots belonging to the
KLA in central Kosovo last month.

Under U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244, the KLA should
have been disbanded and turned in all their weapons by September

<HEADLINE> Real Madrid Signs Luis Figo in World-record Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese winger Luis Figo made
himself the most expensive soccer player in history when he
announced Monday he will leave FC Barcelona to join Real Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid on Monday paid Figo's buy-out fee of 10 billion
pesetas (56 million U.S. dollars) to Barcelona and the 1.6 billion
pesetas ($9 million) in Spanish value added taxes.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I will be as happy as during the years I spent with
Barcelona," Figo said.
</P>
<P>
Figo will play for Madrid starting with the upcoming season,
wearing a jersey with his name and number 10.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the contract was for six years and that Figo
would be paid 800 million pesetas ($4.6 million) per season. Team
officials said specific contract details would be released in the
coming days.
</P>
<P>
The deal beat the $55 million price tag on Argentine striker
Hernan Crespo, paid to AC Parma by Lazio, a world record until
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Figo, Portugal's star of the recent Euro 2000 tournament won by
France, said:" It was a difficult and important decision, but on
top of everything, at this moment, I had to think only of myself
and for that reason I made this decision.
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm here with Real. I feel tranquil in front of the fans,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Walker Appeals against Drug Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- British sprinter Doug Walker
launched a court case Monday challenging the International Amateur
Athletic Federation's right to suspend him from competition for a
positive drug test.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old Walker, the reigning European 200-meter
champion, was at London's High Court to hear his lawyer, Andrew
Hunter, appeal against the IAAF suspension.
</P>
<P>
Walker tested positive for the steroid Nandrolone in November
1998. He was later cleared of any doping offense by UK Athletics,
the sport's governing body in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF refused to accept the ruling and has submitted his
case to arbitration. A hearing is expected in August.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Walker remains suspended under IAAF rules and
is to miss the UK Olympics trials starting on August 13 and the
Sydney Olympics in September.
</P>
<P>
According to IAAF rules, athletes with levels of a banned
substance above the allowed limit are considered offenders unless
they can prove either the test results were erroneous or there
were medical reasons behind the elevated levels.

SHIJIAZHUANG, July 25 (Xinhua) -- It took Jia Chunlin, a 69-
year-old retiree, six years to produce calligraphic copies of two
Chinese literary masterpieces, "Dream of Red Mansions" and "
Romance of the Three Kingdoms", using more than two million
Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
Jia, vice director of a township enterprise before his
retirement, started dabbling with calligraphy in 1994, then
launched his ambitious project.
</P>
<P>
"Romance of the Three Kingdoms" is a tale of retribution and
intrigue and chronicles the breakup of the Han dynasty into three
kingdoms -- Wei, Shu and Wu (168 A.D. to 280 A.D), when the
Kingdom of Jin unified China.
</P>
<P>
Spending four hours a day on his calligraphy, Jia completed the
copying of the "Romance" in 17 months. He had also finished
copying majority of "Dream of Red Mansions" and hoped to complete

<HEADLINE> Church Leaders in Jerusalem Concern Over Free Access to Holy Places </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The Church leaders in Jerusalem
stated on Tuesday that they are not interested in the political
status of Jerusalem, but voiced their concern over free access to
the Holy places in the city.
</P>
<P>
The patriarchs of the Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox and
Armenian Churches expressed their concern during a meeting in East
Jerusalem with Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, in which
Beilin also briefed them on the developments concerning the status
of
Jerusalem discussed at the Camp David summit in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The patriarchs led by Latin Patriarch Michel Sabah told Beilin
that no matter what happens in the Camp David peace talks, they
would want international guarantee of free access.
</P>
<P>
Beilin assured them that the best international guarantee would
be United Nations recognition of an agreement between Israel and
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The three-way Camp David summit of Israel, the Palestinians and
the United States ended Tuesday without any agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians on any of the core issues including the
fate of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Church leaders met on Monday in East Jerusalem with
Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
During the Monday meeting, they expressed their opposition on
the idea of putting the Christian quarter in East Jerusalem under
Palestinian sovereignty while the Armenian quarter under Jewish
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Church leaders also reiterated their proposal that Jerusalem
be granted a special status, backed by international guarantees,
that would ensure freedom of access to the Holy places of all three
monotheistic religions and freedom of worship to all believers.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem is one of the key issues discussed at
the Camp David summit which is trying to reach a framework
agreement on the final-status issues ahead of the September
deadline for a final
peace deal over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

<P>
Eighty representatives of the Colombian government, the ELN and
civil and religious leaders started to meet in Geneva, intending
to lay the ground work for an end to 36 years of conflict in the
South American country.
</P>
<P>
One of the thorniest issues of the Geneva meeting continues
being ELN's request that "a demilitarized encounter area" is
established, serving as a stage for dialogs and which the
guerrillas want to be placed in Bolivar department.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, in this area, imported military operations which
must be halted are now taking place, he indicated.
</P>
<P>
The National Liberation Army (ELN) with 5,000 members, and
second largest rebel group in Colombia, wants an area free of
soldiers, like that the government gave to Colombia's Armed
Revolutionary Forces (FARC), which is holding separate talks with
authorities.
</P>
<P>
ELN was formed in the 1960s by peasants, leftist priests and
radical students. It was nearly eliminated in the 1970s decade,
but revitalized thanks to the help of millions of dollars it
obtained from kidnap and blackmail ransoming of oil firms.

<HEADLINE> Dollar-Euro Basket Could Be Romanian Currency's Future Exchange Etalon: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Central Bank (BNR) has
been studying the possibility to introduce, in the future, the
dollar-euro currency basket as an exchange etalon for the Romanian
Currency leu, the official Rompres news agency reported on Tuesday
citing sources of the bank.
</P>
<P>
"Such a step is premature, at present, but it should be taken,
at the right time", the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The fact that BNR takes the U.S. dollar as an etalon for the
leu exchange value causes an one-billion-dollar loss per year to
the Romanian exporters, selling their commodities to the European
Union,the general secretary of the National Association of Romania
's Exporters and Importers (ANEIR), Mihai Ionescu said.
</P>
<P>
He explained the loss was due to the fact that the traders
receive the value of the exported merchandises in euro, a currency
depreciating against the dollar, whereas the payments related to
the production costs, are made in U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ANEIR official proposed the current exchange reference hard
currency, the dollar be swapped with the dollar-euro basket, a
solution in full accordance with that promoted by the BNR think-
tank.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the ANEIR representative said that the
Romanian national currency leu is already calculated according to
the dollar-euro pair in Eastern European countries such as Poland
and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
At present, two thirds of Romania's foreign trade are carried
out with the EU countries, ANEIR data say.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Renews U.N. Mission in Western Sahara for 3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday unanimously adopted a resolution to approve a three-month
renewal, until October 31, of a 275-member U.N. force that has
been trying for nearly nine years to organize a referendum on the
future of Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council decides to extend the mandate of MINURSO
(the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara)
until October 31, 2000, with the expectation that the parties will
meet in direct talk under the auspices of the Secretary-General's
Personal Envoy to try to resolve the multiple problems relating to
the implementation of the Settlement Plan," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The referendum is to determine whether the former Spanish
colony should be incorporated into Morocco, which controls most of
the territory, or become independent, as demanded by the Algeria-
based Polisario Front.
</P>
<P>
The referendum, key element in a U.N. plan for the territory
from which Spain withdrew in 1976, was originally set for January
1992. It has been repeatedly postponed due to differences over who
should be allowed to vote.
</P>
<P>
 The personal envoy of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker, held a fruitless
meeting with representatives of the two sides in London on June 28
and is expected to hold further talks soon.

<HEADLINE> FARC Ambush Kills 17 Colombian Policemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of policemen killed
following an ambush made by members of Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia (FARC) in a rural zone in southwest Colombia rose to
17, official sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas initially attacked members of the police guarding
oil installations in this area, near the border with Ecuador, and
confrontations took place.
</P>
<P>
Operation head of Colombia's police, General Tobias Duran,
traveled to the area to coordinate search operations of guerrillas.
He said that FARC casualties cannot be numbered, because as is the
custom, this group carries away its dead and wounded when
withdrawing from a confrontation area.
</P>
<P>
FARC is the largest rebel group in the South American country.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Endorses to Deploy U.N. Peacekeepers in Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Tuesday endorsed the deployment of the United Nations
peacekeepers in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the 15-member Council was briefed this
morning by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the latest
developments in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Annan told the Security Council that Israel had ended all
violations of its border with Lebanon, thus paving the way for the
deployment of U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The Council urged all parties to exercise the utmost restraint
and continue to respect the United Nations withdrawal line and to
facilitate the peaceful movement of the United Nations Interim
Force in Lebanon(UNIFIL) in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Council emphasized that violations will not be tolerated
and urged the parties to avoid any incident that could lead to an
escalation of tensions in this sensitive area.
</P>
<P>
The Council underscored the responsibility of the Government
of Lebanon to ensure security and stability throughout its
territory.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced the complete withdrawal of its troops from
southern Lebanon on May 24, ending its 22 years of occupation of
southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL and Lebanese troops are not prepared to deploy until
Israeli violations of the U.N.-established pullback line have been
cleared.

<HEADLINE> Bush Introduces Cheney as Running Mate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush formally introduced former defense
secretary Dick Cheney as his running mate at a press conference at
Texas University in Austin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I picked him because he is fully capable of being president of
the United States and I picked him because he will be a valuable
partner," Texas Governor Bush said.
</P>
<P>
"I was impressed by his thoughtfulness and the way he
approached his mission and, gradually, I realized the person who
was best qualified to be my vice president was working by my side,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Cheney headed a three-month search for a running mate for Bush,
but he himself finally emerged as the top candidate for the slot.
</P>
<P>
Bush announced Cheney as his running mate one week before the
Republican national convention in Philadelphia. Republican
delegates will formally nominate the Bush-Cheney ticket at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
"I enthusiastically accept the challenge for this reason: I
believe you have the vision and the courage to be a great
president," Cheney said of Bush at the press conference. Cheney's
wife, Lynne, and Bush's wife, Laura, also appeared at the press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Observers said Bush selected Cheney as his running mate because
of his experience in foreign policy and his old relations with
the Bush family.
</P>
<P>
Cheney is a rock-solid conservative who poses little or no
political risk to Bush, they said.
</P>
<P>
Cheney, 59, served as defense secretary under Bush's father,
former president George Bush. He masterminded the famous Operation
Desert Storm during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
In his two decades of public service, Cheney also served as
President Ford's chief of staff, six terms in Congress from
Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
Cheney suffered three heart attacks by age 48, and has
undergone coronary bypass surgery. But a doctor commissioned by
the Bush campaign issued a statement saying his health "should not
interfere with a strenuous political campaign."
</P>
<P>
Bush called Cheney from the governor's mansion in Austin at 6:
22 a.m. to offer Cheney the job, and Cheney accepted the offer.
</P>
<P>
Last week Cheney switched his voter registration from Texas to
Wyoming as the U.S. Constitution stipulates that presidential and
vice presidential cannot come from the same state.
</P>
<P>
Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore has not made his
decision yet for the running mate, he is considering a number of
candidates, including former Senator George Mitchell of Maine,
Florida Senator Bob Graham and Massachusetts Senator John Kerry.

<HEADLINE> Fazio Warns Against Inflation Risk in Economic Upswing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Italy Governor Antonio Fazio
warned against wasting the wealth gained from a robust economy,
saying tight controls on public spending and a reassessment of
employer-worker relations were among the approaches needed to cut
down on inflation and labor costs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference of Italian diplomats Tuesday, Fazio
also repeated his recent warnings against inflationary pressure,
which he has argued should be treated with higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
He said the international economic recovery naturally carries
the risk that "one part of the upswing could become lost in higher
prices"and be lost to wealth creation.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted that public spending in "old, closed economies
"could produce higher incomes, but alse generate inflation, adding
that"If economies are open, these mechanisms must be corrected."
</P>
<P>
In this context, he urged European nations to make a careful
review of their spending on the welfare state.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urges Indonesia Military to Cooperate With UNTAET </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council on Tuesday called on the Indonesia military to cooperate
more closely with the United Nations Transitional Administration
in East Timor (UNTAET) to end cross-border incursions from West
Timor.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the Security Council heard a briefing from
the Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping, Hedi Annabi, on
the killing of Private Leonard Manning, 24, from New Zealand, in
East Timor on Monday
</P>
<P>
He was the first United Nations peacekeeper to be killed in
combat in the territory.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council expressed their profound condolences to
the family of Private Manning, who gave his life in the cause of
peace. The Council also expressed their sympathies to the
Government and people of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The Council urged the Indonesia military to disarm and disband
the militias and urged the Government of Indonesia to prosecute
militia members guilty of crimes.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the Council called for the full implementation
of the commitments made by the Government of Indonesia in the
Memorandum of Understanding on Tactical Coordination signed on
April 11, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Private Leonard Manning was shot dead Monday after his patrol
fought a five-minute gun battle with suspected militiamen in a
rugged border area near the East Timor town of Suai.
</P>
<P>
Two New Zealand peacekeepers have been killed in motor
accidents in East Timor, but Manning's death was the first combat
casualty in the territory since the U.N.-backed peace enforcement
team arrived there last September.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Anti-Poverty Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives approved Tuesday a bill which will provide tax
breaks, regulatory relief and new government programs to 40
impoverished communities nationwide that have been left behind
America's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
With a solid 394-27 bipartisan vote, the House sent the bill to
the Senate, where a similar measure is pending.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton is an enthusiastic supporter with
Republican leaders in Congress, making the legislation one of the
few major tax-related bills with a chance of becoming law this
year.
</P>
<P>
The anti-poverty legislation was rushed to the House floor
under special rules prohibiting amendments and limiting debate so
it would pass before Congress recesses in August for the
Democratic and Republican political conventions.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the Department of Housing and Urban Development
would designate the 40 communities where the assistance would
apply from nominations submitted by states. In general, they would
be urban and rural places with "pervasive poverty, high
unemployment and general economic distress."
</P>
<P>
These communities, in turn, would be eligible for tax breaks
and other provisions with the underlying theme of persuading
private companies to invest in inner cities and poor rural areas,
thereby creating jobs and economic activity while minimizing the
role of government.
</P>
<P>
A centerpiece of the bill is the "New Markets" initiative that
establishes 10 venture capital companies to invest in small
businesses located in poor neighborhoods. The government would
guarantee up to 150 million dollars in loans and 30 million
dollars in grants for companies licensed by the Small Business
Administration.
</P>
<P>
There also would be "New Markets" tax credits for investors in
community development entities that provide assistance and
businesses in low-income areas.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's President Urged to Urgently Intervene in Farm Occupation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Farmers Union (CFU)
of Zimbabwe launched a two-pronged bid to end ongoing farm
occupations Tuesday, appealing for the urgent intervention by
President Robert Mugabe while naming him in a new legal
application before the High Court, the Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a petition to Mugabe, CFU President Timothy Henwood
requested him to intervene in the crisis, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the CFU lodged a third legal action before
the High Court, which has twice declared the farm occupations
illegal and ordered the occupiers to vacate.
</P>
<P>
The new application names President Mugabe as a respondent,
along with the police commissioner and Chenjerai Hunzvi, leader of
the war veterans' association spearheading the invasions.
</P>
<P>
It calls for urgent action to redress "a major resurgence of
farm invasions" over the past two weeks in view of death threats
made against farmers by veterans of the country's liberation war.
</P>
<P>
The application to the High Court states that the war veterans
are occupying farms and issuing eviction orders with "no legal
authority", and the "death threats are being issued with such
vehemence and conviction that it would be foolhardy for anyone to
ignore them".
</P>
<P>
"The whole situation is greatly aggravated by totally
inadequate police reaction," it said.
</P>
<P>
The CFU's action came as a white farmer in the northern Karoi
district was beaten unconscious by war veterans Tuesday.

HARARE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign Minister Stan
Mudenge Wednesday met Non Aligned Movement (NAM) Ambassadors and
High Commissioners based in Harare to brief them on the
implications of the Zimbabwe 2000 Democracy Act passed by the
United States Senate on June 23.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge sought the ambassadors and high commissioners' support
against the passing of the bill by the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the bill's implications to Zimbabwe and
developing countries saying it violated all the fundamental
principles of NAM such as the non interference in the internal
affairs of other states, respect for sovereignty, territorial
integrity and independence of member states.
</P>
<P>
He said the Zimbabwean government had instructed its Permanent
Mission to the United Nations in New York to call for an urgent
meeting of the NAM co-ordinating bureau, at which Zimbabwe would
seek NAM's support in opposing the bill.
</P>
<P>
He said African leaders expressed dismay at the bill during the
recent Organization of African Unity meeting in Togo and had
instructed its Secretariat and Ambassadors in Washington to
dissuade U.S. legislators from proceeding to pass the bill into
law.
</P>
<P>
He added that if passed into law, the bill would further
suspend bilateral assistance to Zimbabwe including debt relief and
would instruct U.S. executive directors of the multinational
lending institutions to vote against the extension of any credits
or benefits to Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth Faces Challenge of Good Governance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth secretary-
general Don McKinnon said in Pretoria on Wednesday that a lack of
good governance posed as one of the major challenges confronting
the 54-member organization.
</P>
<P>
McKinnon was speaking at a press conference after senior
officials of 10 member states met in Pretoria in the past two days
to discuss the future role of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action
Group (CMAG), established to deal with serious or persistent
violations of democratic values.
</P>
<P>
The 10 countries are members of the Commonwealth High Level
Review Group established by the Commonwealth Heads of Government
Meeting in Durban, South Africa, last November.
</P>
<P>
The group was tasked to review the role of CMAG and to advise
the Commonwealth leaders on how best it could respond to the
challenges of the new century.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also discussed ways for the Commonwealth to
accelerate the economic and social development of its member
countries through practical programs of cooperation, as well as
advocacy of Commonwealth interests.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Affairs director-general Sipho Pityana,
who chaired the meeting, said one of the Commonwealth's biggest
challenges was the economic development of underdeveloped
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said a question in need of an answer was: "How do we get to
deal with the digital divide that entrenches the widening gap
between north and south?"
</P>
<P>
McKinnon said the two-day meeting was productive, yielding a
large harvest of fresh ideas.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's War Veterans Urged to Stop Disrupting White Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) Wednesday appealed to war
veterans and villagers occupying white-owned farms to stop
disrupting production immediately and allow white farmers to
resume the business of supplying Zimbabwe with food.
</P>
<P>
The appeal followed widespread fears that if all the 4,500
white commercial farmers join the strike to protest unlawful
evictions, beatings, demands for money and other favors by the
former fighters, Zimbabwe will soon run out of fresh farm produce
and that could trigger the ire of consumers.
</P>
<P>
Zanu-pf spokesman Nathan Shamuyarira told the Zimbabwe News
Agency that the party, of which most of the 50,000 ex-freedom
fighters are members, does not support the disruptive activities
some farm occupiers have perpetrated on the farms.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to farmers who have abandoned their properties
in protest to the behavior of the war veterans to return to their
land and continue farming as the government embarks on an
accelerated land redistribution exercise.
</P>
<P>
"Zanu-pf is very concerned with the farm boycotts and the
subsequent closure of businesses in some towns. We want the
farmers to go back to the farms and the war veterans should not
disturb them," he said.
</P>
<P>
We should all be patient as land redistribution is being
executed by the government," said Shamuyarira.
</P>
<P>
The call comes at a time when the Commercial Farmers Union is
suing the government and the police for failing to remove war
veterans from farms or at least protect the farmers in the spirit
of an earlier agreement to ensure peace at farms while land
redistribution is being carried out.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's President Urged to Urgently Intervene in Farm Occupation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Farmers Union (CFU)
of Zimbabwe launched a two-pronged bid to end ongoing farm
occupations Tuesday, appealing for the urgent intervention by
President Robert Mugabe while naming him in a new legal
application before the High Court, the Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a petition to Mugabe, CFU President Timothy Henwood
requested him to intervene in the crisis, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the CFU lodged a third legal action before
the High Court, which has twice declared the farm occupations
illegal and ordered the occupiers to vacate.
</P>
<P>
The new application names President Mugabe as a respondent,
along with the police commissioner and Chenjerai Hunzvi, leader of
the war veterans' association spearheading the invasions.
</P>
<P>
It calls for urgent action to redress "a major resurgence of
farm invasions" over the past two weeks in view of death threats
made against farmers by veterans of the country's liberation war.
</P>
<P>
The application to the High Court states that the war veterans
are occupying farms and issuing eviction orders with "no legal
authority", and the "death threats are being issued with such
vehemence and conviction that it would be foolhardy for anyone to
ignore them".
</P>
<P>
"The whole situation is greatly aggravated by totally
inadequate police reaction," it said.
</P>
<P>
The CFU's action came as a white farmer in the northern Karoi
district was beaten unconscious by war veterans Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Starts to Probe Into Lost Salaries to Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Investigations into the
disappearance of a Ugandan army paymaster with 1.6 billion Uganda
shillings (about 1 million U.S. dollars) have started, Army
Commander Major General Jeje Odongo confirmed in a telephone
interview with Xinhua here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Army paymaster Captain Dan Byakutaga, now said to be on the run
since May 21, 2000, allegedly vanished with salaries of troops of
the Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) in the war-torn
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
"The investigations have started. We have named the people to
do it and they will report back in three weeks," said Odongo.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan army council, chaired by President Yoweri Museveni,
appointed a four-man probe team last weekend. The team members
comprise the auditor general, the inspector general of the
government, a defense ministry representative and an army officer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Byakutaga's family recently called for a
parliamentary inquiry into the officer's disappearance. His wife
said the last time she saw her husband was when she gave him a
lift up to Kabalagala, a suburb of the Ugandan capital Kampala.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Dismisses Framers' Call to Intervene in Maize Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government estimated
that this year's maize production will see a surplus of some 200
tons, ruling out any prospects of importing the commodity, Times
of Zambia newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Yotam Ngulube, deputy minister for Agriculture, Food and
Fisheries, was quoted as saying on Tuesday that in view of the
fact farmers should stop agitating for the Food Reserve Agency (
FRA) to move into the market now.
</P>
<P>
He said the FRA would only buy the surplus and leave the rest
to be determined by the market forces.
</P>
<P>
According to Ngulube, the current consumption level stands at 1.
6 million bags per year, while this year's production was
estimated at 1.72 million bags.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia National Farmers Union complained that maize was
selling at a low price of 6,000 kwacha (about two U.S. dollars) to
12,000 kwacha (about four dollars) per 50-kilogram bag, urging the
FRA to buy maize at 130 dollars per ton to bring the price up.
</P>
<P>
They feared that if the trend was not reversed farmers would
not be able to repay outstanding loans during the 1998/99 and 1999/
2000 seasons.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Optimistic About Resumption of IMF Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is optimistic about the
resumption of aid from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as
the date for discussing the matter by the IMF board draws near,
the Daily Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Finance Minister Chris Okemo told the parliament on
Tuesday that budget support assistance, suspended three years ago
because of corruption and poor governance, would be resumed this
week.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF board will approve Kenya's request for aid on Thursday
this week," said Okemo.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the World Bank board, to be held on August 1 and 2,
would approve a similar resumption of aid, the minister disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Okemo's upbeat statement came in the wake of reports that the
government last Friday received official information from
Washington about the breakthrough in the negotiations with IMF.
</P>
<P>
The green light from the IMF will unlock millions of U.S.
dollars in aid from donor countries, including the British
government, which is set to release some 30 million UK pounds (
about 58 million dollars) to the civil service retrenchment
program.
</P>
<P>
It will enable Kenya to apply for a Paris Club meeting to
discuss a rescheduling of the country's mounting debt arrears
estimated at 150 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
A country cannot qualify for debt rescheduling if it does not
have IMF clearance.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended a 205-million-dollar loan in July 1997 to
protest poor governance and corruption in the east African country,
triggering off an economic slowdown since then.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Land Crisis Likely to Happen in S. Africa: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 26 (Xinhua) -- A majority of respondents who
took part in a survey earlier this month believed that South
Africa could experience the same land invasion in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
A leading South African information company, Research Surveys,
interviewed 1,000 blacks and 1,000 whites in major metropolitan
areas throughout the country to ascertain how they felt about
recent land invasions experienced by farmers in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
More people felt that South Africa could easily experience a
similar land invasion situation in Zimbabwe, as the land was
distributed unevenly amongst race groups, Research Surveys said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The finding, skewed towards whites at almost 70 percent, who
felt this situation could arise, compared to 51 percent of blacks.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-eight percent felt South Africa was unlikely to
experience such a situation.
</P>
<P>
Research Surveys said 40 percent of respondents felt whites in
Zimbabwe, particularly white farmers, were to blame for the land
invasions, as they had not shared enough of their farmlands with
black farmers. Blacks felt more strongly than whites about this
issue, 51 percent of blacks held this viewpoint compared to only 7
percent of whites.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-four percent of the sample felt it was unacceptable for
the war veterans to invade white-owned farms in Zimbabwe and said
they should be removed from farms. Eighty-one percent of whites
and 45 percent of blacks held this opinion. Only 7 percent of
whites and 31 percent of blacks felt the farm invasions were
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
The South African government was perceived by 41 percent of
the respondents to be addressing the local land issue problems and
redistributing land fairly.
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven percent of blacks and 25 percent of whites felt
the government was not doing enough about land redistribution.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-six percent of respondents, 48 percent of whites and 32
percent of blacks, were unhappy about the government's efforts to
redistribute land.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Prices Go up in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's fuel prices began to go
up at Tuesday midnight and more increases are in the pipeline, The
Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Petrol prices rose by 25.6 percent, diesel by 19 percent and
illuminating paraffin more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released last night, Webster Muriritirwa,
managing director of the National Oil Company of Zimbabwe (NOCZIM),
said his company was forced to effect the increases as it was
experiencing viability problems.
</P>
<P>
Since the last retail prices increased in February, NOCZIM has
been selling its petroleum products "at prices between 30 and 40
percent below cost of procurement, and this trend is having a
crippling effect on the operations of the company", said
Muriritirwa.
</P>
<P>
He said the import prices of all categories of petroleum
products continued to increase significantly on the international
market, forcing the company to continuously buy fuel products at
exorbitant prices.
</P>
<P>
This had been exacerbated by an acute shortage of foreign
currency currently being experienced throughout the economy.

Best BP1s were sold at 2.61 to 2.75 U.S. dollars per kg

<HEADLINE> Moldova to Negotiate Agriculture Support Fund with EU, Canada, Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 25 (Xinhua) - The Republic of Moldova still has
to get approval of its fund of agricultural support from the
European Union (EU), Canada and Australia, in the bid to join the
World Trade Organization (WTO), the Moldovan Basa-press news
agency reported on Tuesday quoting Deputy Economics Minister
Gheorghe Gaberi as saying.
</P>
<P>
Gaberi said at a briefing Tuesday that the government has set
the agriculture subvention fund at 540 million lei (43.5 million U.
S. dollars). The settlement of this fund is a WTO entry condition
to Moldova.
</P>
<P>
He specified that officials of the EU nations, Canada and
Australia "have verbally agreed to this sum, but still had to
discuss some aspects with their governments." One of the aspects
is the trade with broadcast products, for which the United States
wants liberalized and the EU protected on its interior markets.
</P>
<P>
According to Gaberi, the government used indicators of the
years 1996 to 1998 for the calculation of this sum. During this
period, Moldova had not allocated subventions to agricultural
producers in the forms agreed with the WTO's rules.
</P>
<P>
The WTO has 137 member countries. Applications from Albania and
Croatia were examined on July 17 and should be expected ratified
in the nearest future. The next negotiation round with Moldova is
scheduled for September.

<HEADLINE> Job Losses Continue Among Large Italian Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 25 (Xinhua) -- The number of jobs in large Italian
businesses (work-forces of more than 500) continued a downward
trend in April, with occupation falling by 0.4 percent compared to
the previous month, Istat, the national statistics bureau reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decline was 2.3 percent compared to the same period in 1999,
with a total of 19,000 fewer jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to Istat's figures, employment among large businesses
fell in the industrial sector, especially among energy companies,
but rose slightly in the service sector, which saw an increase of
0.1 percent or roughly 1,000 jobs in April, and which included
hefty job increases in the hotel and restaurant businesses.
</P>
<P>
In the four first months of 2000, compared to the same period
last year, jobs in the industrial sector on the average were down
2.2 percent, and down 0.2 percent in the service sector.
</P>
<P>
In the industrial sector, Istat said, the loss of jobs was due
in part to restructuring within the energy industry and decreases
in the manufacturing, the food, beverage and tobacco businesses,
as well as a high number of early retirements in the paper,
printing and publishing industries.
</P>
<P>
Jobs were up in some manufacturing industries, among them
rubber and plastic making businesses and processors of non-metal
minerals.
</P>
<P>
The hotel and restaurant business saw an increase of 11.5
percent, trade and repairs of consumer goods jobs increased 6.4
percent and other professional and entrepreneurial jobs rose 3.4
percent.

<HEADLINE> 1.2 Million Canadians face Family violence: StatsCan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 25 (Xinhua) -- An estimated 1.2 million Canadians
faced some form of violence in their domestic relationships in the
period 1994-99, Statistics Canada said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The data suggest that eight per cent of women and seven per
cent of men who were married or in a common-law relationship
during the period experienced at least one incident of violence-
ranging from threats to beatings and assaults with weapons. This
amounts to about 690,000 women and 549,000 men.
</P>
<P>
Women in violent unions were five times more likely than men to
fear for their lives. About 13 per cent of women reported being
attacked or threatened with a knife or gun, compared with seven
per cent of men.
</P>
<P>
About 40 per cent of women in abusive relationships reported
some physical injury, compared with 13 per cent of men.
</P>
<P>
Victims reported more severe forms of violence from former
partners than from current partners.
</P>
<P>
"This could be because individuals might be more likely to
leave violent marriages," Statistics Canada said.
</P>
<P>
In the majority of cases, violence was not an isolated incident,
the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Data from the survey also shows that at least 500,000 children
have seen or heard scenes of domestic violence.

</P>
<P>
Greenspan told the House Banking Committee in his testimony

sustainable pace. The comments identical to the remarks made last
week at the Senate Banking Committee eased fears of more hike in
interest rates although the chairman left door open to further
rate increases.

months in an effort to cool off the hot economy and keep inflation
at bay and a slew of reports showed that the economy is slowing
and inflation remains under control as a result of the hikes.

<P>
But a number of reports today showed a still-robust economy
that made investors uneasy about inflation and interest rates.

Confidence Index rose to an unexpected 141.7 in July from 139.2 in
June. Most analysts expected the index to decline in the month.
