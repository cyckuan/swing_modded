	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian strongman Hun Sen
threatened to arrest his political opponents Monday after grenades
were hurled at his home in the capital from at least one passing
motorcycle. Authorities reported that no one was hurt.
	   Hun Sen, who was not at the house, broke off the last day of
negotiations in the northern city of Siem Reap with representatives
of the opposition parties that have bitterly contested his victory
in parliamentary elections July 26.
	   Before flying back to the capital, where police were deployed in
force, Hun Sen said the attack marked the end of his patience in
dealing with opposition challenges to his victory, which have been
marked by a round-the-clock protests by thousands of people.
	   ``It's time to arrest the organizers of the demonstrations,'' an
outraged Hun Sen said. ``Anyone who has links or is associated with
the demonstrations will be banned from leaving the country.''

UN rights chief begins China mission, gets calls for help
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson began a
mission to China on Monday to discuss a broad range of human rights
issues.
	   It was the first time a U.N. human rights commissioner has
visited China. Robinson's first meetings were Monday morning with
Foreign Ministry officials, a ministry spokesman said.
	   Chinese dissidents and families of imprisoned activists have
written letters asking Robinson to try to persuade government
officials to release political prisoners and end practices that
violate basic rights.
	   Robinson plans to discuss China's progress toward signing and
implementing the two main international human rights covenants. She
also is expected to sign an agreement with the Chinese government
on future cooperation.
	   China signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights last year, but the legislature has not ratified it.
The Communist-ruled government also pledged six months ago to
accede to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
but has not done so.
	   The two covenants are intended to provide baseline guarantees of
such fundamental rights as free speech and assembly, including the
right to form trade unions.
	   Although China's constitution gives citizens those rights, they
are seldom protected in practice. Aggrieved dissidents and their
family members were hoping that Robinson's visit might encourage
improvements.
	   The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement
in China, a Hong Kong-based group, said Monday that dissidents and
families of imprisoned activists had entrusted it with open letters
to pass on to Robinson.
	   One of the letters, signed by 139 democracy campaigners,
protested the sentencing of Zhao Changqing, a teacher in northern
China's Shaanxi province who tried to run for local office, to
three years in prison for disrupting social order.
	   Xu Hong of Shanghai wrote on behalf of her husband, Lin Hai, a
software company director detained since March on charges of
inciting to overthrow state power for giving 30,000 Chinese e-mail
addresses to an dissident on-line magazine.
	   In another letter, Chen Shuangfeng of Qingdao, another eastern
Chinese city, told Robinson her brother Chen Zengxiang, who has
been detained and charged with subversion, has not been allowed to
see a lawyer.
	   An Faxing of Jilin province wrote asking her to urge the
government to allow overseas dissidents in exile to return to
China.
	   An open letter from 116 activists called for an end to the right
of police to send citizens to labor camps for up to four years
without trial.
	   Government critic Chu Hailan also wrote Robinson requesting a
meeting and her help in getting her husband, labor rights
campaigner Liu Nianchun, released from a labor camp.

Quakes shake northeastern China, South China Sea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A moderate earthquake rattled buildings in
China's northeastern Liaoning province late Sunday, after a
stronger quake hit earlier in the day in the South China Sea, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported Monday.
	   A 4.0 magnitude earthquake struck Jianchang County, in Liaoning,
at 9:26 p.m. (1326GMT) Sunday, the report said.
	   The quake was felt in number of cities in southern Liaoning and
in neighboring Hebei province, it said, citing the State Seismology
Bureau.
	   The bureau reported that a magnitude 5.1 earthquake centered in
the South China Sea, west of the Philippines, struck at 8:32 a.m.
Sunday (0032GMT Sunday).
	   There were no immediate reports of damages or casualties from
either earthquake.

Ammaccapane holds on to win Safeway
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: SUBS lede to CORRECT title of tournament. &QL; 
 &UR; By LANDON HALL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTLAND, Oregon (AP) _ After winning the LPGA Safeway Golf
Championship, Danielle Ammaccapane may have a huge bar tab waiting
for her when she goes home to Phoenix.
	   Ammaccapane shot an even-par 72 Sunday to hold off Emilee Klein
by one stroke and her younger sister Dina by three to win the dlrs
600,000 tournament and set off a celebration in Arizona.
	   Klein, who began the round three shots behind Danielle
Ammaccapane, tied her with a birdie 4 on the 501-yard 10th hole
that left both players 11 under par. Ammaccapane then birdied Nos.
12 and 13 on the 6,307-yard Columbia-Edgewater Country Club course
to take the lead for good.
	   ``I thought I was going to have to shoot three or four under to
win,'' Ammaccapane said. ``I didn't have to do that, as it turned
out.''
	   Dina Ammaccapane, 30, finished with a 66 and was third at 207,
her career-best finish, one spot higher than her previous best at
the 1994 Sara Lee Classic.
	   Danielle Ammaccapane, 32, co-owns a restaurant and sports bar in
Phoenix with her father, Ralph. After walking off the 18th green,
she called him at Ammaccapane's and got a welcome worthy of a
``Cheers'' episode.
	   ``He said, `Danielle's on the phone!' and the bar just went
nuts,'' she said. ``It was the loudest sound you ever heard.''
	   It was the best finish in a single tournament for the
Ammaccapane sisters.
	   ``He was in tears,'' Danielle said of her father. ``He was very
happy for my sister and I.''
	   Danielle Ammaccapane finished with a 12-under 204 total to win
her second tournament of the year and the dlrs 90,000 first prize.
She's won seven tour titles, the last coming in the Mercury
Titleholders Championship in May.
	   Klein, who shot a final-round 70, failed in her bid to win her
first title since the 1996 British Women's Open.
	   ``I needed some gifts from her, but she wasn't giving anything
away today,'' Klein said. ``It wasn't Christmas. It wasn't even my
birthday.''
	   Kris Tschetter, who had Sunday's best round with a 65 that
included an eagle, and Erika Wicoff, who closed with a 70, were
another stroke back.
	   The fourth-place finish was a career-best for Wicoff, a
second-year pro who missed the cut 13 times in 22 events this
season.
	   Ammaccapane nearly let the lead slip away when her tee shot on
18 went left into cedar trees and she had to chip out. She bogeyed,
but Klein struggled to make par.
	   Ammaccapane, who didn't have a bogey in the first two rounds,
bogeyed No. 1 Sunday, missing a 5-foot putt. She later missed a
3-footer on No. 4.
	   Ammaccapane got into and out of deep trouble on both 14 and 18.
	   On the 357-yard 14th, she tried to chip over a bunker, but the
ball stopped at the top in the fringe. She chipped again, from
about 20 feet, and it rolled into the cup for par to preserve the
three-stroke lead.
	   On 18, after recovering from the errant drive, she wound up
having to make a 3-foot uphill putt to save bogey and the win.
	   ``I was shaking,'' she said. ``My insides were turning, because
I haven't had a putt like that on the last hole to win.''
	   Klein failed to capitalize, driving her tee shot into a bunker.
She had a chance to tie with a 65-foot chip, but the ball rolled
about two inches to the right of the hole.
	   ``Danielle played great. She got the breaks I didn't have
today,'' said Klein, who, like the Ammaccapanes, went to Arizona
State. She won the 1994 NCAA title at the Oregon Golf Club in
nearby West Linn.
	   Ammaccapane's 72 stopped a string of seven straight subpar
rounds.
	   Kim Saiki finished sixth at 212 after a 67.
	   With the win, Ammaccapane moved up from 17th to 10th on the
money list at dlrs 417,507. Annika Sorenstam, who was not entered
in the tournament, is first at dlrs 806,188. Rookie Se Ri Pak, who
tied for 10th after a 71, stayed at second at dlrs 800,076.

	   A spokesman for opposition leader Sam Rainsy, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said there would be no comment on the
attack since it had nothing to do with his party.
	   The grenade-throwers were not apprehended. Officials said that
they were thrown over the four-meter (12-foot) gates of the lightly
guarded residence from one or two passing motorcycles driving
against traffic.
	   Hun Sen seldom stays at the residence, preferring his
fortress-like compound outside the capital, dubbed the Tiger's
Lair.
	   A Hun Sen bodyguard, speaking on condition of anonymity, told
The Associated Press in Siem Reap that Hun Sen's father was at the
house, but no one was hurt.
	   The attack caps weeks of simmering tensions following the
elections, which opposition party leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy have refused to accept, saying Hun Sen won by fraud.
They have threatened to block the formation of a new government.
	   Sam Rainsy has been particularly instrumental in leading a
round-the-clock demonstration by crowds reaching as many as 15,000
people at a park across from the National Assembly. The protests
have been unprecedented in size or duration.
	   Hun Sen called Sam Rainsy a ``terrorist.''
	   ``This is the real nature of coup d'etat,'' Hun Sen said. ``They
called for soldiers, police to shoot me, to overthrow me. They
called on the U.S. to fire missiles at my house,'' Hun Sen said.
	   ``But when he could not succeed, he used this act of
terrorism,'' Hun Sen said. ``So I think it has come to a stage
where legal action must be taken against this terrorist leader.''
	   Hok Lundy, chief of the national police and one of Hun Sen's
closest allies, said a commission would be formed that would lead
to the arrest of the opposition leaders if they were implicated.
	   ``This is an assassination attempt against Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen and his family,'' Hok Lundy said.

Korean prosecutors seek prison terms for ex-spy officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Prosecutors requested a 12-year prison
term Monday for Kown Young-hae, a former government spy chief, if
convicted of plotting to smear President Kim Dae-jung during his
election campaign last year.
	   They also asked the three-judge panel trying the case to impose
prison terms of up to four years for six former top officials of
the Agency for National Security Planning, who are charged with
being involved in the plot.
	   The ex-spy officials were accused of having tried to disrupt
Kim's presidential campaign last December by depicting him as a
communist or communist sympathizer.
	   Also accused of being involved in the plot was Sohn Choong-moo,
a magazine publisher who allegedly spread unfounded, hostile rumors
about Kim, then an opposition candidate. Prosecutors sought a
five-year sentence for him.
	   ``Heavy punishment is being requested to put an end to the long
practice of the government's main intelligence organization
colluding with a certain political group,'' senior prosecutor Hong
Kyong-shik said.
	   Kwon, 60, a retired army general, headed the spy agency for
three years until he was sacked by the newly elected president in
early March.
	   Charges filed against Kwon and his aides included defamation and
meddling in politics in violation of laws governing the agency's
activities.
	   Kwon admitted in court that he had given a dlrs 250,000 bribe to
a Korean-American businessman who said at news conferences in
Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul that Kim's campaign was funded by
communist North Korea.
	   In a separate trial earlier, the businessman, Yoon Hong-joon,
34, and three lower-ranking agency officials were sentenced to up
to two years in prison.
	   Yoon's accusations were not widely reported in South Korea, and
Kim's campaign did not noticeably suffer.
	   After his inauguration in February, Kim, the first opposition
candidate to win presidential election in South Korea, ordered a
thorough probe of the alleged smear campaign.
	   South Korea remains staunchly anti-communist after fighting a
war with North Korea in 1950-53. Under South Korea's past
authoritarian governments, the spy agency often portrayed
dissidents or political opponents as communists to destroy their
careers.

 &UR; Angels 3, Royals 0 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   In Anaheim, California, Chuck Finley held Kansas City to three
hits over eight innings, and Garret Anderson singled home three
runs in the first as the Angels opened a 3 1/2-game lead over Texas
in the AL West.
	   Finley (11-7), winning for only the fourth time in his last 17
starts, gave up a game-opening single to Johnny Damon, then didn't
allow another hit until Damon singled again in the sixth. Jeff
Conine's single in the seventh was the only other hit off the
left-hander.
	   Finley struck out 10, walked three and allowed just one runner
beyond second base. Shigetoshi Hasegawa pitched the ninth for his
fourth save.
	   Tim Belcher (12-12) scattered seven singles while going the
distance for the second time in a row and 41st time in his career,
but was the victim of three unearned runs.
 &UR; Twins 6, Rangers 5 &QC; 
	   In Arlington, Texas, the Rangers' bullpen blew a two-run lead in
the eighth inning for the second straight night.
	   Texas relievers have lost their last four decisions and seven of
their last eight.
	   Todd Walker hit a two-run homer to tie the game in the eighth
and Denny Hocking threw out the potential tying run in the bottom
of the ninth.
	   Hector Carrasco (4-2) pitched 2 2-3 innings for the win, and
Aguilera got his 36th save.
	   Texas led 5-3 entering the eighth inning, but Xavier Hernandez
(6-5) did not retire a batter for the second consecutive game.
	   Juan Gonzalez had a run-scoring double _ his 148th RBI _ in the
third inning for Texas to tie Cleveland's Albert Belle (1996) for
the most RBIs in the American League since 1949, when Vern Stephens
and Ted Williams each had 159.
 &UR; Orioles 5, Mariners 2 &QC; 
	   In Seattle, Mike Mussina allowed four hits in eight innings and
Eric Davis, Mike Bordick and Roberto Alomar homered for Baltimore.
	   Mussina (13-8) broke a personal two-game losing streak, walking
two and striking out 10. Mussina is 10-1 in regular-season
decisions against the Mariners.
	   Arthur Rhodes pitched the ninth for his fourth save and first
since June 16.

with a strikeout. Raul Ibanez homered for the Mariners.
	   Jeff Fassero (10-12) lost his sixth straight decision.

	   After the attack, squads of military police raced to the house

Philippine government, IMF agree on 1.5 percent GNP growth target
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government and the
International Monetary Fund have agreed on a 1.5 percent growth
target for gross national product this year, according to finance
officials.
	   The Philippines posted a GNP growth rate of 0.6 percent in the
first half of 1998, a far cry from the year-earlier 5.4 percent.
GNP measures the total value of a nation's output of goods and
services.
	   ``We have reconciled our targets for 1998 and we agreed on a GNP
growth rate of 1.5 percent and inflation rate of 9.5 percent,''
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said.
	   The government blamed this year's slowdown on the ill effects of
the year-long regional currency crisis and a severe drought early
this year that resulted in a 7.5 percent contraction in
agricultural performance.
	   This year's new GNP growth target is the third adjustment made
by the Philippine government. The initial target was between 3
percent and 4 percent. The worsening economic situation later
compelled the government to lower the growth target to between 2
percent and 3 percent.
	   It is only in the area of inflation that the country is on
track, Espiritu said in comments over the weekend. The 9.5 percent
inflation rate target for this year is within the projected range
of 9.25 percent to 9.75 percent.
	   The IMF is wrapping up a two-week review of the Philippine
economy. The government also is expected to announce whether it
plans to draw from a dlrs 1.37 billion standby credit made
available under a two-year precautionary program with the IMF
forged early this year.
	   Under the program, the IMF and Philippine government must agree
on economic targets.

<TEXT>
	   In San Francisco, Garrison Hearst put an astonishing end to a
dramatic passing duel, breaking free for a 96-yard touchdown run in
overtime.
	   It was the longest run from scrimmage in 49ers history and
upstaged the battle between quarterbacks Steve Young of the 49ers
and Glenn Foley of the Jets, who was making his first opening day
start. It even overshadowed wide receiver Jerry Rice's return from
two serious knee injuries that had sidelined him most of last
season.
	   The Jets pinned San Francisco on its 4-yard line after a punt.
On the first play, Hearst burst off right tackle, shed a defender
at the line of scrimmage, straight-armed another at about the 20
before shaking free of one more at midfield. Picking up blockers,
he ran down the right sideline with Terrell Owens clearing the way,
and was knocked into the end zone by Mo Lewis' desperation tackle.
 &UR; Cowboys 38, Cardinals 10 &QC; 
	   In Irving, Texas, the Chan Gailey era began for the Cowboys on
Sunday with Troy Aikman running for two touchdowns and passing for
two more against Arizona in the season opener for the new Dallas
head coach.
	   The win snapped a 10-game franchise losing streak that included
five Gailey-coached exhibition games and the last five of the 1997
regular season.
	   Aikman ran for two touchdowns in a game for the first time in
his career. In fact, he had never scored two touchdowns in a season
since he started as a rookie in 1989.
 &UR; Chargers 16, Bills 14 &QC; 
	   In San Diego, Doug Flutie, looking more like a spry rookie than
a 35-year-old, came off the bench after Rob Johnson sustained a
concussion and nearly rallied Buffalo to victory over rookie Ryan
Leaf and San Diego.
	   John Carney's 54-yard field goal, which bounced off the left
upright and went through with 4:30 to play, gave the Chargers the
win in Leaf's first game as quarterback.
	   Flutie, making his first NFL appearance in this decade after
eight years in the Canadian Football League, drove the Bills to the
Chargers 21, only to watch in disappointment as Steve Christie was
wide left on a 39-yard field-goal attempt with three seconds left.
Christie also shanked a 21-yard attempt early in the fourth
quarter.
 &UR; Dolphins 24, Colts 15 &QC; 
	   In Indianapolis, Dan Marino, armed with a more potent running
game, helped spoil the NFL debut of top draft pick Peyton Manning.
	   Marino's statistics weren't spectacular, although he added to
his NFL records by completing 13 of 24 passes for 135 yards. His
biggest play was a 44-yard TD toss to Oronde Gadsden.
	   Manning had his running game stifled by Miami's defense as
Marshall Faulk was limited to 56 yards on 24 carries. The Dolphins
also sacked the former Tennessee star four times for 29 yards.
	   He managed to complete 21 of 37 passes for 302 yards with three
interceptions, including one Terrell Buckley returned 21 yards to
give Miami a 24-9 lead.
 &UR; Chiefs 28, Raiders 8
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, the Chiefs ran up a 17-0 lead before
Oakland ran a successful play and Derrick Thomas sacked Jeff George
six times.
	   It was a painful debut for 35-year-old Raiders coach Jon Gruden,
who saw Thomas come up one short of his NFL record for sacks.
	   But the victory could be costly for the Chiefs, because of an
injury to quarterback Elvis Grbac. The second-year starter, who
missed six games last year with a broken collarbone, was hurt on
the last play of the first half. The Chiefs said it was a bruise to
his right shoulder. He left the field in obvious pain and was
replaced by Rich Gannon.
	   The Chiefs had 10 sacks altogether.

Rios knocked out of U.S. Open by Larsson
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Marcelo Rios, who twice replaced Pete Sampras as
No. 1 in the world this year, has been knocked out of the U.S. Open
in the third round to continue his run of poor results since the
French Open.
	   The second-seeded Rios lost 6-1, 6-7 (3-7), 2-6, 6-3, 6-2 to
Magnus Larsson who served his 17th ace on match point in the Sunday
night game. Larsson won the last five games of the match, which
lasted 2 hours, 27 minutes.
	   The match was played in a festive atmosphere that seemed to turn
Arthur Ashe Stadium into a soccer stadium. The crowd sang soccer
songs and alternately cheered for the players as Chilean flags flew
for Rios and Swedish flags for Larsson.
	   Since starting the year by winning 40 of 45 matches, including
five titles, Rios has been only 11-8 since the French Open.
	   ``He didn't beat me. I made a lot of mistakes, a lot of
errors,'' Rios said. ``These couple of months have been a good
experience. I've got to work hard now.''
	   Larsson, who had seven aces in the final set, twice has been a
quarterfinalist at the U.S. Open, including last year.
	   ``In the fourth and fifth sets I started serving a bit better, I
think that was the key,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter if he's No.
1 or No. 10, I've beaten him before and he's still Marcelo Rios.''

 &UR; Hun Sen threatens to arrest opponents after grenade attack
 &UR; Eds: Combines pvs, minor editing.
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian strongman Hun Sen
threatened to arrest his political opponents Monday after grenades
were hurled at his home in the capital from a passing motorcycle.
Authorities reported that no one was hurt.
	   The tension-filled capital immediately came alive with
speculation that Hun Sen, who was not at the house, had staged the
attack as an excuse to crack down on his opponents and crush weeks
of protests against his continued rule.
	   ``It's time to arrest the organizers of the demonstrations,'' an
outraged Hun Sen said. ``Anyone who has links or is associated with
the demonstrations will be banned from leaving the country.''
	   Hun Sen immediately broke off the last day of stalled
negotiations in the northern city of Siem Reap with representatives
of opposition parties that have bitterly contested his victory in
parliamentary elections July 26.
	   Before flying back to the capital, where police were deployed in
force, Hun Sen said the attack marked the end of his patience in
dealing with challenges to his victory, which have been marked by a
round-the-clock protests by thousands of people.
	   Hun Sen called opposition leader Sam Rainsy, who has been the
most instrumental in the protests, a ``terrorist.''
	   ``This is the real nature of coup d'etat,'' Hun Sen said. ``They
called for soldiers, police to shoot me, to overthrow me. They
called on the U.S. to fire missiles at my house,'' Hun Sen said.
	   ``But when he could not succeed, he used this act of
terrorism,'' Hun Sen said. ``So I think it has come to a stage
where legal action must be taken against this terrorist leader.''
	   A spokesman for Sam Rainsy, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said there would be no comment on the attack since it had nothing
to do with his party.
	   The grenade-throwers were not apprehended. Police said the
grenades were thrown over the four-meter (12-foot) gates of the
lightly guarded residence from one or two passing motorcycles
driving against traffic.
	   Hun Sen seldom stays at the residence, preferring his
fortress-like compound outside the capital, dubbed the Tiger's
Lair. Hun Sen's bodyguards gave conflicting reports about whether
his father or other family members were there.
	   No one was hurt, police and bodyguards said.
	   The attack caps weeks of simmering tensions following the
elections, which opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and
Sam Rainsy have refused to accept, alleging massive electoral fraud
by Hun Sen.
	   They have threatened to block the formation of a new government
and supported anti-Hun Sen protests that have attracted as many as
15,000 people. The protests are unprecedented in size or duration
for Cambodia.
	   Hok Lundy, chief of the national police and one of Hun Sen's
closest allies, said a commission would be formed that would lead
to the arrest of the opposition leaders if they were implicated.
	   ``This is an assassination attempt against Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen and his family,'' Hok Lundy said.
	   After the attack, squads of military police raced to the house
and set up a security cordon. Mok Chito, one of Phnom Penh's police
chiefs, said at least two Chinese-made grenades had exploded.
	   A third that had failed to detonate was found by explosives
experts sweeping the nearby area with metal detectors.
	   Five truckloads of military police headed toward the park
opposite the National Assembly where the round-the-clock protest
against Hun Sen was entering its third week. The police patrolled
the area, dubbed Democracy Square by the protesters, but made no
immediate attempt to disperse the crowd.
	   Grenades have frequently been used to wreak carnage in
Cambodia's violent politics.
	   Hun Sen has dominated the political scene since the mid-1980s
and last year deposed Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a
bloody coup.
	   On March 30, 1997, four grenades were hurled into a protest led
by Sam Rainsy at the same park now being occupied by the
protesters. At least 16 people were killed and more than 100
wounded, including Sam Rainsy.
	   The attack was widely blamed on Hun Sen. He has denied
responsibility. His allies have occasionally accused Sam Rainsy of
staging the attack.
	   Two weeks ago, a grenade was hurled at headquarters of the
National Election Commission, where Sam Rainsy was protesting the
elections. One person died.
	   The Hun Sen-controlled police and judiciary have never arrested
or prosecuted anyone in the cases.

Central bank head says Philippines is not considering currency
</HEADLINE>
controls &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Central Bank is not
considering implementing currency controls such as those imposed by
Malaysia last week, its top official said Monday.
	   Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said capital controls
would be inconsistent with the government's market-oriented
currency policy.
	   A report in a local newspaper Monday quoted an unidentified
Central Bank official as saying the possibility of reimposing
exchange-rate controls was being explored to shield the peso from
speculative attack.
	   But Singson said imposing currency controls would violate the
terms of the Philippines' agreement with the International Monetary
Fund and noted that curbs on foreign-exchange transactions would be
difficult to administer and open to corruption.
	   Malaysia announced a decision last week to restrict free
movement of capital to limit speculation on its currency, the
ringgit.
	   The Philippines imposed capital controls for four decades, which
ended in 1992 during the administration of former President Fidel
Ramos.
	   Singson said in a television interview that the central bank
would not implement capital controls even if the peso tumbled to 50
pesos to the dollar.
	   At midday Monday, the dollar averaged 43.435 pesos, down
slightly from 43.489 pesos on Friday.
	   Singson reiterated that in the event of a speculative attack on
the peso, the first line of defense would be increasing overnight
interest rates.
	   ``There are no plans to change that,'' he said.
	   The Central Bank's overnight borrowing rate, presently 16
percent, is its main tool to control the amount of money available
for speculation.

Late Japanese film director Kurosawa praised worldwide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Directors, critics and fans worldwide Monday
mourned the death of Japanese director Akira Kurosawa as the end of
an era in filmmaking, and marveled at his enduring impact on the
art of cinema.
	   Kurosawa died of a stroke Sunday at his Tokyo home at age 88,
leaving behind a 30-film body of work that put Japanese cinema on
the international stage and influenced a generation of directors at
home and around the world.
	   ``We are not going to see that kind of filmmaking again,'' said
Stephen Prince, author of a 1991 book about Kurosawa called ``The
Warrior's Camera.''
	   Even in Japan, where studios shunned him for decades, officials
prepared to honor the director.
	   Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka told reporters Monday that
Kurosawa would be named a winner of the People's Honor Award, a
widely respected prize for cultural achievement. Japanese
newspapers Monday ran special sections with scenes from his films.
	   Kurosawa was praised in death for the talents that propelled him
to prominence in life: his haunting lyricism, his technical mastery
and his brilliant melding of traditional Japanese theatrical forms
with epic presentation.
	   ``The term `giant' is used too often to describe artists. But in
the case of Akira Kurosawa, we have one of the rare instances where
the term fits,'' said director Martin Scorsese.
	   Kurosawa garnered three Oscars during his half-century career,
which began in 1943 with ``Sanshiro Sugata,'' or ``The Judo Saga.''
His last film was ``Madadayo'' in 1993. His son, Hisao, 52, said he
was working on two projects when he died.
	   The Cannes Film Festival honored Kurosawa in 1985 with a special
trophy for achievement upon the debut of his 28th film, ``Ran.''
Among his other movies to gain worldwide acclaim were: ``The Seven
Samurai,'' ``Kagemusha'' and ``Rashomon.'' The latter won him his
first Oscar.
	   At the Venice Film Festival, officials scheduled a commemorative
showing Monday of ``Rashomon,'' for which Kurosawa won its Golden
Lion award in 1951.
	   While Kurosawa's death inspired elegies around the world _ from
French President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin,
for example _ the reaction at home was more ambiguous, with
admiration for his work mixed with criticism of the neglect
Kurosawa suffered in his homeland.
	   ``Japan does not understand very well that one of its proudest
cultural achievements is in film,'' the Mainichi newspaper said in
an editorial detailing the problems Kurosawa faced at home.
	   Kurosawa had a love-hate relationship with his homeland, drawing
deeply on classic Japanese themes like the warrior spirit, but
having to look elsewhere for financial and artistic support.
	   In the 1960s and 1970s, Japanese studios gave Kurosawa short
shrift even as his reputation grew overseas. In 1980, George Lucas
and Steven Spielberg persuaded 20th Century Fox to back
``Kagemusha'' after financiers at home shied away.
	   ``He's been a prophet without honor in his own country for a
number of years,'' said Donald Richie, a writer, cultural critic
and author of ``The Films of Akira Kurosawa.''
	   It was Kurosawa's international appeal _ as well as his
reputation as a hothead and spendthrift _ which made him suspect in
Japan, where many believe the essence of Japanese culture is its
inscrutability for outsiders.
	   Born in Tokyo in 1910, Kurosawa was the youngest of eight
children. He turned to the cinema after failing to get into art
school as a painter. At 33, he directed his first film, ``Sugata
Sanshiro.''
	   His breakthrough came in 1950, with ``Rashomon.'' It won the
Academy Award for Best Foreign Film in 1951 and launched a decade
of landmark films that included ``Seven Samurai'' (1954) and
``Throne of Blood'' (1957).
	   ``Dodeskaden'' was a critical and commercial flop in 1970, but
he made a comeback in 1975 with the bleakly lovely Siberian-set
``Dersu Uzala,'' which brought him his second Oscar.
	   In 1990, he became the first Japanese to receive the honorary
Academy Award for lifetime achievements.
	   Kurosawa stirred controversy with his 1991 film, ``Rhapsody in
August,'' whose presentation of the atomic bombing of Nagasaki was
called one-sided and simplistic by American critics.
	   Disappointments followed. ``Dreams,'' a 1990 series of
vignettes, was described by one critic as ``a snooze.'' And 1993's
``Madadayo'' was neglected at the box office.
	   Kurosawa's wife, actress Yoko Yaguchi, died in 1985 after 35
years of marriage. Besides son Hisao, they had a daughter, Kazuko.
	   Two private ceremonies have been scheduled _ a wake at his home

Singapore's digital TV recommendation due before year's end
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The Singapore Broadcasting Authority said
Monday it will receive a recommendation by year's end on whether
the European, American or Japanese digital television standard
should be adopted in the city-state.
	   Trials of all three versions were conducted from May to Sept. 4
by the authority's digital TV standard committee and the results of
the field tests will be analyzed in the report, according to a
press release.
	   The committee was checking the robustness of signals under fixed
and mobile conditions, and the effectiveness of coverage. Those
factors are ``critical for a highly built-up city like Singapore,''
said the announcement.
	   The system chosen must also be compatible with Singapore's
planned island-wide Internet network, which is aimed at eventually
connecting all homes, businesses and schools for electronic
interaction.

Japan, Hong Kong stocks soar; other markets follow suit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Reacting to the strength of Japan's yen against
the U.S. dollar and positive developments in several local issues,
Asia's top two stock indexes opened sharply higher Monday.
	   Other Asian bourses also rallied as the gains in Japan and Hong
Kong lifted other currencies and improved market sentiment in the
crisis-stricken region.
	   ``Foreign investors' confidence in the region has restored
somewhat after last week,'' when several countries announced new
market-control measures, said Norman Chan, associate director of
investment research at the Allen Perkins Group in Hong Kong.
	   ``The yen is also expected to stay rather strong,'' against the
U.S. dollar, which would lift pressure on other regional
currencies, Chan added.
	   Malaysia's key Composite index opened another 13 percent higher,
following last Friday's 16.1 percent rise, as the newly-imposed
stock and currency controls boosted liquidity.
	   Nearby Singapore's main index jumped 3.8 percent as confusion
subsided over the impact of its neighbor's market controls would
have on the city-state.
	   Hong Kong's beleaguered bourse jumped 7.6 percent by midday as
investors welcomed new liquidity-boosting measures took effect
Monday.
	   In Japan, the benchmark 255-issue Nikkei Stock Average jumped
2.76 percent to 14,430.67 at the end of the morning session, as the
U.S. dollar dropped to a four-month low against the yen.
	   Analysts added Japanese stocks also rose on renewed hopes of
speedy banking reforms, sparked by reports that a compromise may be
in the works between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and
opposition lawmakers.
	   The yen rallied early Monday after Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan hinted Friday at an interest rate cut to prevent a U.S.
recession because of global economic problems.
	   In early trading, the dollar bought 132.46 yen _ it's lowest
since May 12. The greenback was down 2.95 yen from late Friday in
Tokyo and below its late New York level of 133.57 yen on Friday.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed the morning
session 566.03 points higher at 8,054.50.
	   Analysts say the new measures announced over the weekend to
strengthen the currency board system boosted bank liquidity, cut
interest rates sharply, and buoyed investors' confidence.
	   In the latest series of measures to protect the territory's
currency link to the U.S. dollar from speculative attacks, the de
facto central bank announced it would guarantee banks loans at 7.75
Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar, a rate set 15 years ago.
	   Investors think ``at least for the foreseeable future interest
rates will come down, and it will be more difficult for speculators
to attack the Hong Kong dollar,'' said Percy Au-Young, sales
director at DBS Securities in Hong Kong.
	   Speculators have been determined to weaken the currency link by
drying the system of the Hong Kong dollar, hence driving up
interest rates and depressing stock prices.
	   Stock markets in Thailand, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia and
the Philippines were all higher at midday.

Philippine president orders rapid sale of seized TV networks,
</HEADLINE>
newspaper chain &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada has ordered
the rapid sale of two government-seized television stations and a
popular newspaper chain to reduce a swelling budget deficit, an
official said Monday.
	   The media companies are among a variety of corporations that
were seized from close associates of the late dictator Ferdinand
Marcos after his ouster 12 years ago.
	   The government hopes this year to auction the two TV stations _
Intercontinental Broadcasting Corp. and Radio Philippines Network _
and the Journal group of companies, which publishes tabloids, Press
Secretary Rod Reyes said.
	   Estrada has ordered the companies to coordinate with government
agencies to draw up auction plans, Reyes said.
	   However, in most cases the former owners of the companies have
challenged the seizures in court, and ownership questions must be
settled before the government can proceed with the sales.
	   Last December, the Supreme Court blocked a scheduled auction of
IBC after a petition was filed questioning the government's right
to sell it.
	   After turning a small surplus in 1997, the government's budget
is expected to slide into a deficit of 40 billion pesos (dlrs 930
million) this year, according to government officials. The
International Monetary Fund has projected, however, that the
deficit could reach 50 billion pesos (dlrs 1.2 billion).

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by Japanese government spokesman in
5th-6th grafs

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In the latest sign Japanese lawmakers are moving
toward a compromise on key banking legislation, a top official of
the ruling party said he's willing to consider tougher rules for
using public funds to bail out failing lenders, a news report said
Monday.
	   Yoshiro Mori, the Liberal Democratic Party's secretary-general,
said he was open to opposition party demands for greater bank
disclosure as a condition for using public money, the Asahi
newspaper reported.
	   ``If we're using public funds, we must make the rules strict. If
there's something we think is right in what the opposition parties
say, we want to make new rules,'' Mori was quoted as saying.
	   Mori also indicated his party is willing to accept a request
made over the weekend by U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin that
Japan set aside more money to bail out ailing banks, the report
said.
	   But Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka, the government's top
spokesman, told reporters Monday that the 13 trillion yen (dlrs 100
billion) currently budgeted for bank bailouts is sufficient and the
LDP had no plans to increase it.
	   ``Right now we are not studying such measures,'' Nonaka said.
	   New legislation for cleaning up the banking industry's bad loan
problem is at the center of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's efforts
to revive Japan's recession-bound economy.
	   But the use of public funds has been a point of contention
between the LDP and opposition parties, who share control of the
upper house of Japan's bicameral parliament and must compromise for
bills to pass.
	   The LDP has proposed using public money to engineer a ``soft
landing,'' forcing banks to clean up their books once and for all
without letting large banks fail.
	   For its part, the opposition has softened initial resistance to
the use of taxpayers' money.
	   A key opposition party, the New Peace Party, now says it will
support the LDP if it requires banks receiving public money to
fully disclose their financial problems and hold executives
responsible for any misdeeds.

Japan successfully launches 68th ozone-survey rocket
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan on Monday successfully launched the 68th
rocket in an almost 40-year-old program to survey the Earth's ozone
layer, an Education Ministry official said.
	   The MT135 rocket lifted from the Kagoshima Space Center in
southwestern Japan at 11:00 a.m. (0200 GMT), said Tsutomu Numata of
the ministry's Research Institute Division.
	   Numata said a Japanese vessel later recovered the rocket's
sensor payload, which splashed in waters about 50 kilometers (31
miles) southeast of the launching site.
	   The ministry plans to launch the same type of rocket from the
space center, located 985 kilometers (610 miles) southwest of
Tokyo, on Tuesday, Numata said.
	   The rockets fly to an altitude of 56.7 kilometers (35 miles)
before releasing a special ozone-measuring probe, which floats back
down to the Pacific Ocean by parachute.
	   The ministry has launched one or two rockets annually since 1959
to collect data on the density of ozone and temperatures in the
stratosphere, Numata said.
	   Data obtained from the survey are available to universities and
experts in Japan and other nations, the official said.

Heavy fighting on northern outskirts of Afghan capital
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAR-E-KOTAL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Dawn broke Monday to the thunder
of rocket fire and fighter jets pounding enemy positions on the
Afghan front line, barely 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the
war-ruined capital of Kabul.
	   Taliban soldiers said opposition troops launched a massive
assault near Pul-e-Sufian, north of Kabul. For several hours both
sides waged a blistering rocket duel which woke residents of this
devastated city.
	   ``I woke up because of the rocket fire and I just sat up and
listened with my head lying like this on the windowsill,'' said
Mohammed Shafi, cradling his head in his arms.
	   At Sar-e-Kotal, a Russian-made tank guarded the middle of the
road, its gun barrel facing battlefields several kilometers (miles)
north.
	   The road winds past a plain and on toward the hills, past a
sprawling graveyard where brightly colored flags marking hundreds
of graves flutter in the breeze.
	   A scruffy bearded man with a Kalashnikov automatic rifle slung
over his shoulder checked cars, hauling out passengers. He said he
was looking for enemy infiltrators sent into Kabul by former
military chief Ahmed Shah Massood, now a leader of the northern
alliance.
	   The man refused to identify himself, saying only that he was
with the security ministry.
	   But farther down the road, other Taliban soldiers were willing
to talk.
	   ``We didn't launch the offensive, it was Massood,'' said Ghulab
Shah, a stocky Taliban soldier.
	   The only two major fighting forces still arrayed against the
hard-line Taliban army are Massood's troops, which control the area
north to the Panjshir Valley, and Shiite Muslim soldiers of
Hezb-e-Wahadat.
	   In August, the Taliban's opposition, largely led by Massood,
lost substantial ground. The Taliban army moved into the northern
strongholds of Mazar-e-Sharif and swept through the northern
provinces of Balkh, Samargan and Kunduz.
	   Only in recent days has the fighting returned to the northern
edges of the capital as Massood's soldiers try to force their
Taliban opponents from positions in the foothills of the Hindu Kush
mountains.
	   To the southwest of Kabul, another front has opened in recent
weeks. This one between the Taliban and Shiite Muslims of
Hezb-e-Wahadat, mainly Hazaras, named for the central region of
Hazarajat where they originate.
	   The Taliban's top commanders have been assigned to both front
lines. Jalaluddin Haqqani, whose headquarters in eastern Khost was
attacked by U.S. missiles on Aug. 20, is making regular forays to
the front line north of Kabul.
	   At his home in Kabul, Haqqani's fighters said he spent the
previous night near Pul-e-Safian directing Taliban forces.
	   Shah, the Taliban soldier, said his comrades mounted a ground
attack and pushed Massood's soldiers out of a handful of outposts,
but neither side made significant gains.
	   The number of casualties in the fighting was not known.
	   An ambulance from the International Committee of the Red Cross,
one of the few international organizations still operating in
Kabul, was allowed to enter the battle zone to retrieve the wounded
and dead.
	   ``We think Massood lost lots of soldiers. They left the bodies
behind,'' said Shah. This could not be confirmed independently.

South Africans wary of Malaysian opener
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Despite being rated among the
favorites to win the Commonwealth Games sevens rugby tournament,
South African coach Deon Oosthuysen is wary of the Springboks'
opening fixture against the host nation this Saturday.
	   South Africa's ability to adapt to seven-a-side rugby and the
humidity in Kuala Lumpur were key factors in his side's quest for a
gold medal, Oosthuysen said.
	   The pressure will be on the 15-man world champions against
Malaysia this Saturday in their opening pool B match, he said.
	   ``There is pressure on us to win, especially after our
performances at the three-nations tournament,'' he said, referring
to the Springboks' victory in the recent Tri-Nations 15-man series
against Australia and New Zealand.
	   ``But we have to do our best because we are one of the favorites
here.''
	   South Africa was not used to the seven-a-side format or the
Malaysian conditions, Oosthuysen said.
	   ``I hope it will not rain during the Games,'' he said.
	   ``Yesterday we were shocked the rain came so heavy without
warning and the grass at the MPPJ Stadium in Kelana Jaya is at
least two inches longer than what we are used to playing on back
home.''
	   South Africa is joined in pool B by Cook Islands, Trinidad and
Tobago and Malaysia.
	   Opening ceremonies for the 16th Commonwealth Games are Friday.
Some 6,000 athletes from 70 countries are participating.

Report: Bids soon for new utility to break Singapore monopoly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The government is expected to call for bids on
the Tuas Power utility, which will break the monopoly held by
Singapore Power when operations start next April, a newspaper
reported Monday.
	   Once Indonesia gas supplies are finalized, prequalifying tenders
are expected to be sought in the next few months for the 3 billion
Singapore dollar (dlrs 1.71 billion) utility, The Business Times
reported.
	   The government's investment holdings arm, Temasek Holdings, is
expected to keep a 40 percent stake in Tuas Power, leaving 60
percent available for sale, the paper said.
	   Tuas Power is expected ultimately to list its stock, with shares
to be sold to the public out of the government's stake, the paper
said.
	   Data available as of March showed that Tuas Power had an
authorized capital of 1.5 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 855
billion) with 822 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 468 million) paid
up. The authorized capital represents the investment in the
first-stage 1,200 megawatt oil-fired station, now nearing
completion.
	   A second stage gas-fired plant is also planned.

World Bank to tackle corruption in Indonesian projects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The World Bank said Monday it is
trying to stamp out corruption that critics allege has eaten away
at its Indonesian aid projects.
	   In an opinion piece published in several Indonesian newspapers,
bank officials skirted a charge that some 20 percent of money meant
for projects in Indonesia had been siphoned off by corrupt
Indonesian officials.
	   However, they said the bank had to ``honestly evaluate history,
including our own successes and failings.''
	   ``The central issue is not whether 20 percent of development
funds were or were not misappropriated; figures such as these are
the roughest of rough estimates,'' the officials said.
	   ``What really matters is that corruption is widespread in
Indonesia and it poses a major obstacle to economic growth and
fairness. Wherever it is found, it must be stamped out,'' they
said.
	   The article said the Washington-based bank was considering
stepping up independent audits of aid projects and establishing a
project watchdog committee.
	   The officials, the bank's Vice President Jean-Michel Severino
and its Indonesia director Dennis De Tray said the watchdog
committee, if established, would take in non-governmental
organizations, ``other members of civil society and increased use
of independent audits and international public sector reform
specialists.''
	   De Tray and Severino said the bank had begun discussing this
plan with the Indonesian government.
	   They said the fight against corruption would ``continue to be a
major priority in our dialogue with the government and will have a
significant influence on future lending.''
	   The Wall Street Journal reported last month that Indonesian
officials were believed to have taken more than 20 percent of bank
project money allocated to the sprawling Southeast Asian nation.
	   The newspaper cited a World Bank internal memorandum detailing
large-scale corruption.
	   Long present in Indonesia, the World Bank has been sharply
criticized for not blowing the whistle on the country's economic
mismanagement and frail banking system before Asia's financial
meltdown erupted last year.
	   The World Bank's soul-searching comes as the Indonesian
government also moves to show its commitment to cracking down on
the corruption, collusion and nepotism that characterized much of
the rule of former president Suharto.
	   Last week, the government canceled some contracts linked to the
family of the former president and said it may review others.
	   Suharto stepped down in May after riots and protests rocked
Indonesia.

Yeltsin lobbies Russian lawmakers to approve prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Yeltsin meeting lawmakers. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia's economy floundering, President Boris
Yeltsin called Russian parliamentary leaders to the Kremlin in a
bid to persuade lawmakers to approve his candidate for prime
minister in a key vote Monday.
	   Russia has had an interim government for the past two weeks, and
acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has been struggling to
win confirmation from an opposition-dominated parliament, leaving
little time to devote to the economic crisis.
	   Both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin met with the leaders of the
parliamentary factions at the Kremlin, but the Communists and their
allies have insisted they would vote against Chernomyrdin on Monday
afternoon.
	   Russia needs a government ``trusted by the people, including
both houses of parliament,'' Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said
in a television interview Sunday night.
	   Both he and Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of the liberal Yabloko
party, said that Chernomyrdin had not earned that trust.
	   Yeltsin on Friday proposed the meeting with lawmakers, prompting
parliament to postpone a second vote on confirming Chernomyrdin.
The Duma, the lower house of parliament, overwhelmingly rejected
Chernomyrdin last Monday.
	   If the Duma rejects Chernomyrdin again on Monday, Yeltsin can
either renominate him or another candidate for a third vote, which
would take place in about a week's time.
	   If the Duma rejects the president's candidate on the third vote,
then the constitution calls for the president to dissolve the Duma
and call new elections within three months. Yeltsin would
effectively rule by decree during the interim.
	   Chernomyrdin, speaking on national television Sunday, said he
hoped the Duma would approve his nomination. He compared Russia to
a ship driven toward cliffs by stormy weather, and said the crew
should stop arguing and follow its captain.
	   He also stressed that Russia still wants aid and cooperation
from the West to help ease the economic crisis, which has seen the
ruble collapse and prices soar.
	   ``Russia is now enmeshed in the global financial system, and
this system doesn't want any collapse,'' Chernomyrdin said on the
popular television program ``Itogi.''
	   He said Russia needed to at least double its gold and foreign
currency reserves, ``hopefully through the (assistance) of the
global financial system,'' he said.
	   It was his latest effort to reassure Western governments and
Russian reformers that he hopes to avoid retrenchment into
Soviet-style economic isolation, which some people have predicted.
	   Chernomyrdin also sent a message Sunday to the finance ministers
of Britain, Germany, France and Italy saying that ``with the help
of the international community, we will manage to stabilize the
situation,'' Russian news agencies reported.
	   The letter was a response to Britain's decision to call an
emergency meeting of other members of the Group of Eight
industrialized countries to discuss how to help Russia's new
government when it is formed.
	   Russia is in the midst of one of its most serious economic and
political crises since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   The economy has been in free fall, with the government devaluing
the ruble and effectively defaulting on foreign loans. Ever since
Yeltsin fired the previous Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko, the country has been groping its way through the crisis
without a government.

Graf ousted before quarterfinals, first time in 14 years

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It was the Age of Martina _ Navratilova, not
Hingis _ and Chris Evert.
	   John McEnroe won his fourth U.S. Open men's singles title by
beating Ivan Lendl, and Jimmy Connors had reached the Wimbledon
final.
	   The year was 1984 and Steffi Graf, then 15 years old, made her
debut in the main draw at the National Tennis Center, losing in the
first round to fellow German Sylvia Hanika 6-4, 6-2.
	   Fourteen years later, Evert and Connors are in the International
Hall of Fame, with McEnroe, Navratilova and Lendl sure to join them
in the Newport, R.I., shrine in the next few years.
	   And Graf is out of the U.S. Open before the quarterfinals for
the first time since she fell to Hanika 14 years prior.
	   Her conqueror Sunday night was 19-year-old Patty Schnyder of
Switzerland, one of the bright rising stars in women's tennis.
	   After her loss, Graf, dressed in a blue T-shirt emblazoned with
the New York Yankee ``NY'' on her chest, left the National Tennis
Center with a promise.
	   ``I'll be back,'' she said.
	   There was an upset in the men's singles Sunday night when
second-seeded Marcelo Rios lost to Sweden's Magnus Larsson 6-1, 6-7
(3-7), 2-6, 6-3, 6-2.
	   Although seeded 11th in this year's field, three spots below
Graf, Schnyder probably should have been the favorite in their
fourth-round encounter. Graf actually is 26th in the Corel WTA Tour
rankings this week, while Schnyder is ranked 10th: Graf received a
special seeding after missing more than a year after undergoing
knee surgery.
	   In their match, it was Schnyder who operated with surgical
precision, showing off a bigger forehand that the woman once called
``Fraulein Forehand'' and repeatedly picking on the German's
weakness, her slice backhand.
	   ``She has a lot of potential. There's no question about it,''
Graf said of Schnyder. ``She's got so much talent. ... She uses the
court extremely well.''
	   Schnyder, who has won five tournaments this year, jumped out to
a 3-0 lead and took advantage of 14 unforced errors by Graf in the
first seven games. Graf, who began the match with tape around her
right wrist, removed the tape after falling behind 5-2.
	   In the second set, Schnyder took a 2-1 lead with another service
break. Graf immediately broke back, and the set was tied 4-4 until
Schnyder broke again in the ninth game. She then saved two break
points and served out the victory on her second match point.
	   ``She's the greatest player in the last 10 years. Sometimes it's
difficult because you think of that,'' Schnyder said. ``But you
just try to play against her like all other opponents.''
	   Graf has won 21 Grand Slam tournament singles titles and held
the No. 1 ranking for a record 374 weeks. She is less than dlrs
14,000 shy of taking over the career earnings title from
Navratilova, a figure she would have eclipsed if she had reached
the quarters.
	   Since that beginning in 1984, Graf reached the quarters in 1992
and the semifinals in '85, '86 and '91. With the exception of last
year, when she was recuperating, she has reached the final every
other year, winning in 1988, '89, '93, '95 and '96. The loss also
halted a 17-match winning streak at the year's final Grand Slam
tournament.
	   ``At times, it has been difficult to accept that it is going to
take a certain time,'' Graf said of her return to the game. ``There
have been good and bad moments _ I knew that they would come.''
	   The other top women's seeds won as the first week came to a
close.
	   Top-seeded Martina Hingis and No. 6 Monica Seles reached their
quarterfinal matchup, despite struggling. Wimbledon champion Jana
Novotna, the No. 3 seed, also won and will face Schnyder next.
	   Besides Rios, who supplanted Pete Sampras as the top-ranked
men's player twice this year, also failing to advance was
fifth-seeded Richard Krajicek, who retired in the second set of his
match against Thomas Johansson of Sweden with tendinitis in his
left knee.
	   French Open champion Carlos Moya, seeded 10th, outlasted
Jan-Michael Gambill 6-2, 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) in a three-hour
match in which both players tossed rackets in frustration. Gambill
is expected to make his Davis Cup debut for the United States later
this month.
	   Another American, Geoff Grant, also lost a five-set
heartbreaker, falling to Germany's Oliver Gross 7-5, 6-7 (5-7),
5-7, 6-3, 7-5.
	   That leaves only two American men _ former champions Sampras and
Andre Agassi _ in the running for the crown.
	   Other winners Sunday included No. 7 Alex Corretja of Spain, No.
11 Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, No. 13 Tim Henman of Britain and
Mark Philippoussis of Australia.

With McGwire at 60, the Sammy Sosa show comes to town

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Moments after Mark McGwire stepped to the
plate, bats cracked and balls sailed over the fence. But it was his
St. Louis teammates doing the homering; McGwire came up empty, his
day's legacy a wicked line drive that curved heartachingly foul.
	   Now, with Sammy Sosa and the Chicago Cubs in town today and
McGwire on pause at No. 60, baseball's leading home-run hitters are
set to spend the next two days watching each other try to become
the king of the long ball. Busch Stadium is sold out; anticipation
grows with each at-bat.
	   ``If you can't be looking forward to these two games, then your
heart is not beating,'' McGwire said.
	   ``The situation is going to be pretty much out of control,''
said Sosa, nipping at McGwire's heels with 58 homers.
	   Oh, and by the way _ the Cardinals beat the Reds 5-2 on Sunday
in a game that had little statistical significance to either team,
both of which are hovering under .500. Not so the Cubs.
	   ``What they're going for is more meaningful, obviously,''
Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. ``They're trying to qualify
for the playoffs. We're just trying to finish over .500.''
	   One key question _ are opposing pitchers throwing around
McGwire? _ still hangs, though Sunday's at-bats seemed to indicate
McGwire was getting his shots in. The sixth-inning screamer into
the stands left of left field _ off Reds starter Brett Tomko _
could just as easily have been fair, and a line shot at the mound
in the eighth almost took reliever John Hudek's head off before
second baseman Bret Boone threw McGwire out.
	   ``He was just one person I had to get out,'' said Hudek, ice
packs attached to both a shoulder and a knee. ``I just didn't do a
very good job of getting anyone else out.''
	   Tomko, who said last week he wouldn't mind surrendering No. 62,
concurred.
	   ``I think Mark knows that I went after him aggressively. It's
not even an issue,'' he said, though he allowed this much: ``Either
way, I was going to have a story. Now I can say I struck him out
with history on the line.''
	   The sixth-inning drive, off Tomko's 93-mph fastball, silenced
Busch's 47,904 fans for a heartbeat. Then the crescendo of screams
rose _ and fell just as abruptly when the ball landed 7 feet foul.
	   ``After a career of being on the sidelines, from the bench I
knew it was foul,'' La Russa said.
	   McGwire struck out three pitches later, ending up 0-for-3 but
managing to score once after being walked amid a hearty cacophony
of boos.
	   Watching in the stands were Roger Maris' four sons and two
daughters, with Roger Maris Jr. holding the bat his father used to
hit No. 61 some 37 years ago. The Maris boys, boys no longer, have
their father's intense gaze and carry his mantle; they lined up
after the game to praise McGwire and Sosa.
	   ``Dad always said every record was made to be broken,'' said
Randy Maris, 37, ``He knew this one was going to be broken, too.''
	   In all, McGwire and Sosa have homered on the same day 20 times
this season. And when they're apart, they try to watch each other
on television.
	   ``I am a fan of the game as well as a player, and I absolutely
enjoy watching him play,'' McGwire said. ``He is having an
absolutely magical year and, you know, I root him on just like
anybody else.''
	   The attention _ however welcome _ is enough to make a Cardinal
shudder. ``Oh, man, it's going to be absolutely bonkers around
here,'' outfielder Brian Jordan said.
	   Reds manager Jack McKeon was more stoic. After all, the
Cardinals travel to Cinergy Field on Wednesday. And...
	   ``If he doesn't break the record, we'll see you guys in
Cincinnati,'' McKeon said, ``and we'll be asking the same questions
all over again.''
 &UR; Notes: &LR;  Jordan hit a go-ahead sacrifice fly in the eighth. After
McGwire grounded out, Ray Lankford and Fernando Tatis hit
consecutive homers. ``People don't want to see me hit a home run,
they want to see him hit one,'' Tatis said. ``I want to see him hit
one, too.'' ... Juan Acevedo (8-3) was the winner and Hudek (5-6)
took the loss. ... Dmitri Young hit a two-run homer for the Reds.
... Matt Morris struck out 10 in seven innings for St. Louis.

Dollar tumbles in Tokyo, stock prices soar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon bond and dollar
rates

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar dropped to a four-month low against
the yen Monday after Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan hinted
at an interest rate cut to prevent a U.S. recession. Tokyo stocks
soared.
	   The dollar bought 132.12 yen in mid-afternoon trading after
dropping as low as 131.83 _ its lowest point since May 6. The
greenback was down 3.29 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and below its
late New York level of 133.57 yen on Friday.
	   On the stock market, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average surged 747.15 points, or 5.32 percent, to close at
14,790.06. On Friday, the Nikkei lost 218.33 points, or 1.53
percent.
	   The U.S. currency remained under selling pressure after Eisuke
Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister for international
affairs, told reporters the correction of the yen's excessive
weakness had only just begun.
	   That continued a trend set Friday in New York, where the dollar
dropped after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted that the U.S.
central bank is prepared to act to keep the U.S. economy from
slipping into recession because of global economic problems.
	   ``There's a feeling in the market that Greenspan is suggesting
the possibility of interest rate cuts,'' said Shuji Takano,
assistant manager of foreign exchange at the Tokyo branch of
ABN-Amro Bank.
	   Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less
attractive to investors.
	   Japanese stocks rose on reports a compromise may be in the works
between ruling party and opposition lawmakers over banking reform.
	   A Liberal Democratic Party official was quoted Monday as saying
his party was willing to accept opposition demands for greater
disclosure from banks in a bail out using public funds.
	   A key opposition group, the New Peace Party, has signaled it
will back LDP bills if such disclosure is required.
	   Debate in parliament over the bank bail out bills will continue
Monday. The LDP wants to use public funds to prevent large banks
from failing as it forces the banking sector to finally write off
its massive bad debts.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange rose 38.18 points, or 3.49 percent,
to 1,132.65. The TOPIX closed down 19.30 points, or 1.73 percent,
on Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.040 percent from Friday's finish of 1.070 percent,
driving its price up to 112.83 yen from 112.61 yen.

Hong Kong stocks soar as new measures boost liquidity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ New measures to strengthen Hong Kong's currency
board fueled a strong stock market rally early Monday, with the
main index soaring 7.6 percent and shares of smaller banks surging
more than 10 percent.
	   The new measures, announced at the weekend, boosted liquidity in
the banking system, sent interest rates sharply lower, and buoyed
investors' confidence, analysts said.
	   The strengthening of the Japanese yen and other regional
currencies also lifted market sentiment, analysts said.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed the morning session 503
points 7.6 percent higher at 8,054.50 points, after Friday's 2.3
percent increase.
	   Property shares rose more than 10 percent, and shares of several
smaller banks rose more than 14 percent.
	   Following measures announced recently aimed at curbing stock
market speculation, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the
territory's de facto central bank, announced Saturday a set of new
measures to strengthened the Hong Kong dollar's 15-year currency
link to the U.S. dollar, which has come under repeated speculative
attacks during the 14-month Asian financial crisis.
	   Among the new measures is a guarantee that the authority would
lend money to banks at 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar,
which would boost bank liquidity.
	   To weaken the currency peg, speculators have been trying to
drive up local interest rates. They hope higher interest rates
would depress the stock market, and they can profit from placing
market bets in the stock futures market that share prices would go
down.
	   The government last month spent billions of dollars (billions of
U.S. dollars) to buy stocks to counter pressure from speculators,
who were driving share prices down.
	   Banks and investors generally welcome the new measures on
Monday.
	   Investors ``now think at least for the foreseeable future
interest rates will come down, and it will be more difficult for
speculators to attack the Hong Kong dollar,'' said Percy Au-Young,
sales director at DBS Securities in Hong Kong.

South Korea approves Hyundai's tourism project in North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The government on Monday approved
plans by the Hyundai business group to start sightseeing tours of a
scenic mountain in North Korea beginning later this month.
	   Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate, hopes to start
sending up to 2,000 tourists a week on two luxury cruise ships
beginning on Sept. 25.
	   ``All except some minor details have been set, and the first
ship will be able to depart as scheduled,'' Kim Jong-su, a Hyundai
spokesman, said.
	   The tourism project would mark the first major joint venture
between the two hostile Korean states and give Pyongyang a new
source of badly needed foreign currency.
	   Visitors will be allowed to hike Diamond Mountain on North
Korea's east coast, and travel outside the mountain will be
strictly banned.
	   Tourists will return to their ships at the end of each day,
Hyundai officials said.
	   North Korea already has approved Hyundai's plan to spend dlrs
95.8 million to build a berthing facility at a port near the
mountain and construct restaurants and other facilities.
	   South Korean officials estimate that North Korea can earn up to
dlrs 100 million a year in hard currency from the tours, which
Hyundai hopes will attract about 360,000 tourists a year.
	   The first 500-room cruiser, chartered from Malaysia, arrived in
South Korea Monday. The second ship will arrive in two weeks,
Hyundai said.
	   The ships will pick up tourists in South Korea's Donghae port on
the east coast and transport them to North Korea's Changjon port.
From there, tourists will travel to the mountain by bus.
	   Hyundai will charge each tourist about dlrs 1,000 for the
five-day trip, including dlrs 300 to be paid to North Korea for
visa processing and using North Korean facilities.
	   The Seoul government said North Korea has agreed to guarantee
the safety of the tourists and form a joint rescue squad with
Hyundai in case of emergencies.
	   The Korean peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. They fought a three-year war in the
early 1950s. Their border is sealed with 2 million troops deployed
on both sides.

Divers find flight data recorder, now seek Swissair jet's fuselage

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Divers working in 190-foot
(57-meter) waters have found the flight data recorder of Swissair
Flight 111 and will next try to confirm the location of fuselage
sections which may hold many victims' bodies.
	   The retrieval of the so-called black box on Sunday was the first
major breakthrough for crash investigators, who are trying to
determine why the MD-11 jetliner plunged into the sea off the coast
of the fishing village of Peggy's Cove Wednesday night, killing all
229 people on board.
	   The flight data recorder will be flown to a laboratory in Ottawa
for examination. If it's in good condition, it would provide more
than 100 types of technical data that could help explain why the
plane's cockpit filled with smoke and why the pilots' emergency
conversation with traffic controllers was cut off six minutes
before the crash.
	   Divers will continue searching for the second black box _ the
cockpit voice recorder that would reveal other noises in the
cockpit in addition to the already available conversation with
controllers.
	   They also will try to confirm that three large pieces of
wreckage near the flight data recorder are sections of the plane's
fuselage.
	   ``Some of them are squashed. It's in very poor shape, but it is
visible and it looks like an aircraft fuselage,'' said Capt. Phil
Webster, a navy spokesman.
	   Though officials have declined to give an updated figure of how
many bodies have been recovered, they have indicated that most
remain in the sea. Recovery of the fuselage could also lead to
recovery of many more bodies, officials said.
	   A U.S. Navy rescue and salvage ship embarked Sunday from
Philadelphia to assist in the possible recovery of large aircraft
parts.
	   The USS Grapple, which assisted in the deep-sea investigation of
the TWA Flight 800 crash in 1996, carries equipment capable of
lifting 300 tons, plus more than 30 divers. It is expected to reach
Nova Scotia on Wednesday.
	   The Swissair plane crashed 16 minutes after the pilots reported
smoke in the cockpit and decided to attempt an emergency landing.
The plane started toward the Halifax airport, but made two sharp
turns as it tried to descend and dump fuel.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Swissair officials said they had
reconstructed the final phase of the flight, based on information
from Canadian investigators. They said the plane couldn't have made
a direct approach to Halifax from where it made the first distress
call because it was flying too high and was too heavy with fuel.
	   The call was made 70 miles (112 kilometers) out of Halifax, but
the pilots would have needed 130 miles (208 kilometers) to make a
direct landing, Swissair's chief pilot, Rainer Hiltebrand, said.
However, he said attempting to land in Halifax was still better
than trying for Boston, which the pilots initially suggested to
controllers.
	   Alan Wolk, a U.S. pilot and aviation lawyer, said in a statement
Sunday that Flight 111's pilot, Urs Zimmermann, showed an initial
lack of urgency and should have begun an emergency descent sooner.
	   ``The MD-11 could have been landed overweight without
difficulty,'' Wolk said. ``We have learned from aircraft fires
historically that the only procedure that has a prayer of avoiding
an accident is the quickest possible descent and landing.''
	   At a military air base outside Halifax, pathologists continued
the grim and technically difficult task of trying to identify the
badly fragmented human remains that have been retrieved from the
crash site thus far.
	   Dr. John Butt, Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, said he has
been groping for gentle ways to convey to the victims' families
that few of them will take possession of mostly intact bodies.
	   Butt also said he had been seeking advice from the medical
officials who handled body identification after the crash of TWA
Flight 800 off the south shore of New York's Long Island. Asked to
compare the state of the bodies in the two crashes, Butt replied,
``This is much more difficult.''
	   More than 300 relatives of Flight 111's victims have flown to
Nova Scotia.
	   Memorials were held through the weekend at Peggy's Cove and in
nearby Halifax.
	   At St. John's Anglican Church in Peggy's Cove, a haggard-looking
Rev. Richard Walsh began his regular Sunday service by noting
``this has been a terrible week.''
	   In his sermon, Walsh told about 25 parishioners that the tiny
village shares in the grief of the families. ``Those people became
spiritually part of our community. We won't forget them.''

Grenade attack could end deadlock; Hun Sen threatens arrests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Incorporates BC-Cambodia-Grenade Attack. Details on talks.
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A grenade attack at Cambodian
strongman Hun Sen's house Monday threatened to bring a violent end
to weeks of political stalemate, with Hun Sen accusing his rivals
of a coup and menacing them with arrest.
	   The tension-filled capital came alive with speculation that Hun
Sen, who was not at home, staged the attack as an pretext to crack
down on his opponents and protests against his continued rule.
	   ``It's time to arrest the organizers of the demonstrations,''
Hun Sen said. ``Anyone who has links or is associated with the
demonstrations will be banned from leaving the country.''
	   The main target of his wrath appeared to be opposition leader
Sam Rainsy, whom Hun Sen branded a ``terrorist.''
	   Police said the grenades were thrown from one or two passing
motorcycles over the gates of the house. No one was hurt. There
were conflicting reports over whether Hun Sen's father or other
family members were at home at the time.
	   There were no arrests, but Hok Lundy, the national police chief,
lost no time in labeling the attack an ``assassination attempt''
and threatening opposition leaders with arrest.
	   The attack underscored the failure of three days of talks
mediated by King Norodom Sihanouk to find a settlement between Hun
Sen's party and the two main opposition groups over the outcome of
the July 26 parliamentary elections.
	   Hun Sen broke off the talks in the northern city of Siem Reap
and flew to the capital. Explosives teams cleared an area around
the Independence Monument, near his house, for his helicopter to
land. Upon arrival, he went into a news conference.
	   Police were deployed in force, patrolling a park opposite the
National Assembly where round-the-clock anti-Hun Sen demonstrations
by thousands of people entered their third week.
	   Hun Sen signaled that the attack marked the end of his patience
and called it ``the real nature of a coup d'etat.''
	   Hun Sen deposed his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
in a bloody coup last year. Ranariddh, the king's son, is the other
main opposition leader.
	   ``They called for soldiers, police to shoot me, to overthrow me.
They called on the U.S. to fire missiles at my house,'' said Hun
Sen, referring to statements made by Sam Rainsy.
	   ``But when he could not succeed, he used this act of
terrorism,'' Hun Sen said. ``So I think it has come to a stage
where legal action must be taken against this terrorist leader.''
	   Hok Lundy, the police chief and one of Hun Sen's closest allies,
said a commission would be formed that could lead to the arrest of
the opposition leaders.
	   ``This is an assassination attempt against Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen and his family,'' Hok Lundy said.
	   Military police set up a security cordon around the house.
Police said at least two Chinese-made grenades had exploded. A
third that failed to detonate was found by explosives experts
sweeping the nearby area with metal detectors.
	   The only damage appeared to be a shattered window. Hun Sen
seldom stays at the residence, preferring his fortress-like
compound outside the capital, dubbed the Tiger's Lair.
	   A spokesman for Sam Rainsy, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the attack had nothing to do with his party.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have refused to accept Hun Sen's
official victory in the elections, saying he won by massive fraud.
The electoral authorities, controlled by Hun Sen, have rejected all
of their complaints.
	   They threaten to boycott the National Assembly when it meets for
the first time Sept. 24, denying Hun Sen the needed two-thirds
majority to form a new government. On his own, Hun Sen controls
only 64 of the 122 seats.
	   Sihanouk, 75, the prince's father, failed to mediate a
settlement over the weekend and expressed fears of a ``more and
more tragic crisis.''
	   The opposition has been bolstered by protests unprecedented in
size or duration as crowds of up to 15,000 people have camped
across the street from the assembly in a park, dubbed Democracy
Square, and demanded Hun Sen's ouster. He has dominated Cambodian
politics since the mid-1980s.
	   On March 30, 1997, four grenades were hurled into a protest led
by Sam Rainsy at the same park. At least 16 people were killed and
more than 100 wounded, including Sam Rainsy. The attack was widely
blamed on Hun Sen. He has denied responsibility.
	   Two weeks ago, a grenade was hurled at headquarters of the
National Election Commission, where Sam Rainsy was protesting the
elections. One person died.
	   No one has ever been arrested or prosecuted.

Angry Congolese businessmen side with rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to ``billion'' in graf 4; RECASTS graf 14 to ADD
peace talks due to start Monday. &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Victor Ngezayo believed doing business in
Congo would become fair and easy after rebel leader Laurent Kabila
took control of this vast and naturally rich African nation.
	   He was wrong.
	   In 1997, Kabila signed a deal with Canadian-based Banro
Resources Corp. of Toronto, represented by Ngezayo, which invested
an initial dlrs 340 million in gold mining in eastern Congo.
	   Less than a year later, Kabila scrapped the contract and awarded
the concession to a newly formed Congolese company. Banro is now
suing the Congolese government for dlrs 1 billion in damages. The
suit was filed in Washington D.C. where SAKIMA, a branch of Banro
operating in Congo, is registered.
	   ``We couldn't do business under Kabila,'' Ngezayo said in his
lakeside villa where he is waiting an end to a month-old
anti-Kabila rebellion. ``That man didn't respect any laws or any
international conventions.''
	   Rebels and businessmen blame corrupt leaders, lack of democratic
institutions and repeated failures of both longtime dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko and Kabila to ensure a strong business environment and a
broadbased, elected government for the nation of 47 million.
	   One of the richest African countries in gold, diamonds, cobalt
and copper, Congo is limping along at subsistence level. Jobs are
scarce, state-run economic institutions have crumbled and political
upheavals have added to insecurity.
	   An average monthly teacher's salary in Goma is dlrs 15 _ but
nobody has been paid in years and teachers are charging parents for
education.
	   Disillusioned and angry, Ngezayo has returned to his native
Goma, where he contacted the rebels fighting to oust Kabila and
install a new, democratic government.
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's
army and opposition politicians _ accuse Kabila of mismanagement,
corruption and nepotism _ everything he promised to eradicate after
he toppled Mobutu in May 1997.
	   On Monday, the rebels controlling a quarter of the country were
expected at peace talks seeking to negotiate a cease-fire and the
withdrawal of foreign troops from Congo at Zimbabwe's Victoria
Falls.
	   Ngezayo and other Congolese dealers are now waiting to see what
the second rebellion in two years can change.
	   ``Everything's paralyzed. I can't do any business. I can't
travel. I can't reach my employees. And if this persists, it will
be bad for business,'' Ngezayo said. ``Nobody wants to invest in a
war zone.''
	   Apart from gold mining, he also lost control of a chain of
hotels he owned in the government-controlled Congo. Three thousand
of his employees are unpaid, he said.
	   ``This country can function only with right political leaders,''
he said. ``You can't do business violating legal procedures. You
need responsible and accountable authorities.''
	   ``Instead of privatizing, Kabila was nationalizing. He must have
missed the train,'' Ngezayo's colleague, Simba, said.
	   Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, the rebel leader, accused Kabila of
ruining the little that was left of Congo's economy after it was
pillaged during Mobutu's 32 years in power.
	   ``Mobutu used to take 10 percent of commissions on international
business deals. Kabila is taking 30 percent,'' he said.

Omagh will become a shrine to peace, McAleese predicts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The town of Omagh, where 29 people
died in a terrorist bomb blast, will become a ``shrine of
goodness'' symbolizing transcendence over the differences splitting
Northern Ireland, Irish President May McAleese said Monday.
	   McAleese made the prediction while speaking at a lunch gathering
in her honor hosted by Prime Minister John Howard.
	   McAleese said it had been extraordinary to be in Omagh after the
Aug. 15 bombing that killed 29 people and injured 330.
	   ``There was a real feeling after Omagh that ... we still are
Nationalist, Unionist, Protestant, Catholic, but somehow something
else had transcended that,'' she said.
	   ``While those differences remain, they have been transcended now
by the fact that we were now people who had said yes to peace.
	   ``I believe that Omagh will in time come to be recognized as a
real shrine to goodness, as a place where we made a stand for
`yes','' McAleese said.
	   She said that the commitment to peace inspired by the Omagh
bombing was greater than that on the day the Irish people approved
the Good Friday peace agreement.
	   ``After Omagh, we were tested,'' McAleese said.
	   ``I think what our `yes' meant was that each of us shifted
enough to create space in our lives for the very otherness of
others,'' McAleese said.''We are now creating a culture of
consensus, where there are winners and winners.''

No unrest as Myanmar students take protested exams
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ University students took long-postponed
examinations without incident Monday as truckloads of riot police
guarded against possible outbreaks of anti-government unrest.
	   Last week, hundreds of students unhappy with the exam system had
staged several small demonstrations that were quickly quashed by
police.
	   The military government, which tolerates little dissent, is
particularly sensitive to trouble now as it faces a challenge from
the pro-democracy opposition, which has threatened to convene
parliament on its own.
	   The military has not allowed parliament to convene since the
National League for Democracy, led by Nobel Peace Prize-winner Aung
San Suu Kyi, won a landslide victory in a 1990 election.
	   The last known protest by the students from the Yangon Institute
of Technology came Thursday night, at the separate Hlaing campus
where many boarding students reside. Authorities sealed off the
Hlaing campus from then until Monday.
	   Students were ferried by bus Monday morning from the Hlaing
campus to the technology institute, about two kilometers (1.2
miles) away. At one entrance to the Hlaing campus, two truckloads
of riot police were visible.
	   Around the technology institute, police were present in force
but discreetly on side streets in an evident effort to avoid any
confrontations.
	   About 2,300 students sat for the three-hour exams, delayed for
more than a year. Security appeared to be relaxed when the students
were ferried back to the Hlaing campus afterward.
	   All universities and colleges in Yangon and the country's
second-biggest city, Mandalay, were closed indefinitely in December
1996 after student unrest.
	   Educational institutions in other parts of the country,
unaffected by the unrest, continued their classes and held their
1997 final examinations. They did not, however, reopen for the
following school year.
	   Some have been reopened within the last few months so students
could prepare for and take long-delayed exams.
	   But the students protesting last week said they had not been
allowed adequate time to prepare, and had demanded the exams be
postponed.
	   There were more than 374,000 students attending arts and
sciences colleges and universities, and about 4,300 at the
technical institutes, including medical, dentistry, and engineering
colleges, before the closures, according to official statistics.
	   Students have spearheaded most political protest movements in
Myanmar _ also called Burma _ since before World War II, when it
was a British colony.
	   The government is extremely cautious about giving students
freedom of expression, fearful they may align themselves with the
pro-democracy movement.
	   Suu Kyi and her colleagues in the National League for Democracy
have vowed they will convene parliament sometime during September.
The government has threatened to arrest the opposition leaders and
ban the party if they try.

Higher Singapore unemployment expected for rest of year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The number of job openings has fallen short of
job seekers for the first time since the 1980s recession, and
unemployment will worsen during the rest of the year, Singapore's
Ministry of Manpower said Monday.
	   The head of the ministry, Lee Boon Yang, told Parliament Friday
that the actual unemployment rate in June was 3.2 percent, up from
2.4 percent the previous year.
	   ``Total employment shrank in the (second) quarter, the first
contraction since the last economic recession,'' the ministry said
in announcing its program for dealing with increased joblessness.
	   Calling it the ``4R strategy,'' the ministry said it would focus
on redeployment of displaced workers, renewing the work force with
new skills, realigning employment practices with such measures as
shortening work weeks and increasing part-time jobs, and
revitalizing job creation by attracting industries with growth
potential.

Police complain about onlookers at swordsman incident

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Police on Monday criticized some
onlookers in a crowd of 2,000 for urging a deranged man armed with
a medieval sword to use it on officers during a two-hour standoff
in central Melbourne.
	   At one point, hecklers taunted the man by yelling: ``Use the
sword, we're getting bored.''
	   The incident Sunday night ended after police squirted the man's
face with mace-like spray.
	   The 41-year-old man, whose name was not released, was spotted
near the busy intersection of Flinders Street and Swanson Walk in
downtown Melbourne waving a sword of about three feet (1 meter).
	   The same man held police at bay with a sword in May last year,
claiming he was the immortal Fifth Highlander, a character in the
movie ``The Highlander,'' starring Sean Connery.
	   During Sunday's standoff, a crowd of about 2,000 gathered
outside bars and one of the city's main train stations to watch as
police with dogs and in riot gear and armored cars tried to disarm
the man without shooting him.
	   At least three onlookers were affected by the spray, which
police used several times.
	   Superintendent Tony Warren said Monday police had asked the
crowd several times to move back.
	   He said some ``very foolish, very careless'' people had acted
``with gross stupidity'' by crossing the police cordon and walking
close to the area. Two people were charged with hindering police.
	   ``Unfortunately people don't seem to react to the dangers. They
think they're watching television. This is real life. ... They can
get seriously injured,'' Warren said.
	   ``People hanging around were goading the man. He was responding
to their taunts and it was always possible that he would lunge at
the crowd.''
	   The man had been undergoing psychiatric assessment, Warren
said.

With McGwire at 60, the Sammy Sosa show comes to town

 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Moments after Mark McGwire stepped to the
plate, bats cracked and balls sailed over the fence. But it was his
St. Louis teammates doing the homering; McGwire came up empty, his
day's legacy a wicked line drive that curved heartachingly foul.
	   Meanwhile, Sammy Sosa left Pittsburgh with two more home runs,
two curtain calls, two victories _ and 58 reasons to look forward
to his showdown Monday with McGwire.
	   ``I'd say it's going to be like the World Series,'' Sosa said
Sunday after failing to homer in the Chicago Cubs' 4-3, 10-inning
loss to the Pirates. ``It's going to be pretty much out of
control.''
	   Now, with Sosa and the Cubs in town Monday and McGwire on pause
at No. 60, baseball's leading home-run hitters are set to spend the
next two days watching each other try to become the king of the
long ball. Busch Stadium is sold out; anticipation grows with each
at-bat.
	   ``If you can't be looking forward to these two games, then your
heart is not beating,'' McGwire said.
	   ``The situation is going to be pretty much out of control,''
said Sosa, nipping at McGwire's heels with 58 homers.
	   Oh, and by the way _ the Cardinals beat the Reds 5-2 on Sunday
in a game that had little statistical significance to either team,
both of which are hovering under .500. Not so the Cubs.
	   ``What they're going for is more meaningful, obviously,''
Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said. ``They're trying to qualify
for the playoffs. We're just trying to finish over .500.''
	   One key question _ are opposing pitchers throwing around
McGwire? _ still hangs, though Sunday's at-bats seemed to indicate
McGwire was getting his shots in. The sixth-inning screamer into
the stands left of left field _ off Reds starter Brett Tomko _
could just as easily have been fair, and a line shot at the mound
in the eighth almost took reliever John Hudek's head off before
second baseman Bret Boone threw McGwire out.
	   ``He was just one person I had to get out,'' said Hudek, ice
packs attached to both a shoulder and a knee. ``I just didn't do a
very good job of getting anyone else out.''
	   Tomko, who said last week he wouldn't mind surrendering No. 62,
concurred.
	   ``I think Mark knows that I went after him aggressively. It's
not even an issue,'' he said, though he allowed this much: ``Either
way, I was going to have a story. Now I can say I struck him out
with history on the line.''
	   The sixth-inning drive, off Tomko's 93-mph fastball, silenced
Busch's 47,904 fans for a heartbeat. Then the crescendo of screams
rose _ and fell just as abruptly when the ball landed 7 feet foul.
	   ``After a career of being on the sidelines, from the bench I
knew it was foul,'' La Russa said.
	   McGwire struck out three pitches later, ending up 0-for-3 but
managing to score once after being walked amid a hearty cacophony
of boos.
	   Watching in the stands were Roger Maris' four sons and two
daughters, with Roger Maris Jr. holding the bat his father used to
hit No. 61 some 37 years ago. The Maris boys, boys no longer, have
their father's intense gaze and carry his mantle; they lined up
after the game to praise McGwire and Sosa.
	   ``Dad always said every record was made to be broken,'' said
Randy Maris, 37, ``He knew this one was going to be broken, too.''
	   In all, McGwire and Sosa have homered on the same day 20 times
this season. And when they're apart, they try to watch each other
on television.
	   ``I am a fan of the game as well as a player, and I absolutely
enjoy watching him play,'' McGwire said. ``He is having an
absolutely magical year and, you know, I root him on just like
anybody else.''
	   The attention _ however welcome _ is enough to make a Cardinal
shudder. ``Oh, man, it's going to be absolutely bonkers around
here,'' outfielder Brian Jordan said.

Wage deal ends Israel's public sector strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A five-day strike of Israel's 300,000 public
sector employees ended Monday after the Histadrut Trade Union
Federation and the Treasury agreed on a 1.5 percent wage increase.
	   The deal averted a shutdown of Ben-Gurion International Airport
at the last minute. The Histadrut had threatened to widen its
strike and close the airport at 9 a.m. (0700 gmt) Monday.
	   The strike has disrupted life in Israel for the past five days.
In Tel Aviv, garbage piled up in the streets Sunday as municipal
sanitation workers joined the stoppage. All government offices,
post offices, railroads and seaports were closed.
	   Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman has said the wage increases
demanded by the unions would cause runaway inflation. Histadrut
leader Amid Peretz accused Neeman of scaring the public with
figures many times greater than the real cost of the increases.
	   The agreement does not affect school teachers who have been on
strike for the past eight days and have conducted separate
negotiations. A new round of talks between the teachers' union and
the Treasury was to be held later Monday.

After grenade attack, Hun Sen orders arrests, end to protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Hun Sen orders park cleared by
midnight, says Sam Rainsy arrest imminent &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Accusing the political opposition of
launching a grenade attack against his house Monday, strongman Hun
Sen said his most bitter opponent would be arrested and ordered an
end to weeks of protest against his rule.
	   The attack set the stage for a violent end to the worsening
confrontation between Hun Sen and the opposition leaders, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, since disputed parliamentary
elections July 26.
	   Hun Sen, who was not at home during the attack, rejected
speculation at a news conference that he had staged the incident to
crack down on opponents. But he left little doubt he was looking to
reassert his authority.
	   ``The arrests are to start from this hour,'' Hun Sen said. ``How
many people will be arrested is up to prosecutors to decide. We
urge the people who are to be arrested not to resist.''
	   Hun Sen said there was ``already a request'' for the immediate
arrest of Sam Rainy, his most strident opponent and chief leader of
round-the-clock anti-Hun Sen protests entering their third week.
	   Hun Sen branded Sam Rainsy a ``terrorist.''
	   Ranariddh, whom Hun Sen deposed as co-prime minister in a bloody
coup last year, could also be arrested, Hun Sen said.
	   Hun Sen gave the protesters until midnight to pack up their
tents, mats and cooking gear and clear out from the park opposite
the National Assembly they call ``Democracy Square.''
	   ``We have to return public and social order to the citizens of
Phnom Penh,'' Hun Sen said.
	   Police patrolled in force around the park, but there was no
immediate move against the crowd.
	   Sam Rainsy was huddled with United Nations officials. His party
said any arrest would not be based on evidence and would violate an
agreement Hun Sen had with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The agreement allows opposition leaders who fled Cambodia in the
wake of last year's coup to return to freely contest the elections.
	   Police said two grenades were thrown from one or two passing
motorcycles over the gates of Hun Sen's residence in the capital.
No one was hurt. Hun Sen told reporters that family members,
including his father, were not home at the time.
	   Police said two Chinese-made grenades had exploded. A third that
failed to detonate was found by explosives experts nearby. The only
damage appeared to be a shattered window.
	   Hun Sen seldom stays at the residence, preferring his
fortress-like compound outside the capital.
	   There were no arrests, but Hok Lundy, the national police chief,
lost no time in labeling the attack an ``assassination attempt''
and threatening opposition leaders with arrest.
	   The attack underscored the failure of three days of talks
mediated by King Norodom Sihanouk to find a settlement between Hun
Sen's party and the opposition over the outcome of the elections.
	   Sihanouk, 75, the prince's father, issued a statement ``to
express my deep sorrow about the disgraceful act the terrorists
have committed toward the prime minister.''
	   Hun Sen signaled that the attack marked the end of his patience
and called it ``the true nature of a coup d'etat.''
	   ``They called for soldiers, police to shoot me, to overthrow me.
They called on the U.S. to fire missiles at my house,'' said Hun
Sen, referring to Sam Rainsy.
	   ``But when he could not succeed, he used this act of
terrorism,'' Hun Sen said. ``So I think it has come to a stage
where legal action must be taken against this terrorist leader.''
	   The opposition contends Hun Sen, who has dominated Cambodian
politics since 1985, won the elections by fraud. It has threatened
to deny him the needed two-thirds majority to form a new
government. On his own, Hun Sen controls only 64 of the 122 seats.
	   On March 30, 1997, four grenades were hurled into a protest led
by Sam Rainsy at the same park. At least 16 people were killed and
more than 100 wounded, including Sam Rainsy. The attack was widely
blamed on Hun Sen. He has denied responsibility.
	   Two weeks ago, a grenade was hurled at the headquarters of the
National Election Commission, where Sam Rainsy was protesting the
elections. One person died.
	   No one has ever been arrested or prosecuted.

 &UR; Russian market shows little faith in political talks; no dollar
trading &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Trading in U.S. dollars was canceled Monday on the
Moscow interbank currency exchange over a lack of dollar offers,
but the opening rate indicated a further collapse of the Russian
ruble.
	   No dollars were available for sale despite the offer of 20.66
rubles per dollar, down from an official rate of 16.99 over the
weekend, said the exchange's deputy director Alexei Mamontov.
	   Trading was canceled by a joint decision of the exchange, known
as MICEX, and the Central Bank, he said. In electronic
over-the-counter trading, the dollar was quoted at 24 to 31 rubles
Monday.
	   The ruble's sharp dive apparently showed that the market had
little faith in an immediate positive outcome of Monday's Kremlin
talks between President Boris Yeltsin and parliamentary leaders.
	   The State Duma, parliament's lower house, was to hold a second
approval vote for Yeltsin's acting prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, later in the day. So far, the dominant Communists and
their allies are insisting they would continue to oppose
Chernomyrdin after voting him down last week.
	   Russia's battered economy has been in a free fall since
mid-August, with the government refusing to support the ruble and
effectively defaulting on foreign loans.
	   The ruble fell from about 6.2 to the dollar in August and
inflation last month jumped to 15 percent from less than 1 percent
a month previously. The Central Bank's reserves stood at dlrs 12.7
billion as of Aug. 28, down from dlrs 13.4 billion on Aug. 21.
	   Many Russians who receive their salaries in rubles besieged
stores in Moscow and other cities over the weekend, trying to buy
those goods still sold at bargain pre-crisis prices.
	   There were crowds at large department stores and the range of
goods at many grocery stores across the capital was dwindling. So
far, the crisis has not sparked unrest, but the Russians were
stocking up on essential household items, clothing and basic
foodstuffs.
	   Cooking oil soared to 30 rubles a bottle from about 10 before
the crisis, and groats were sold for about 20 rubles a kilogram
(2.2 pounds), up from about 7 rubles.
	   The interim government has done little to stop the whirlwind.
Over the weekend, however, Chernomyrdin sought to reassure Western
governments and Russians that there would be no retreat to a
Soviet-style economic system.
	   In a message to European financial ministers Sunday, he promised
that ``with the help of the international community, we will manage
to stabilize the situation.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia's economy floundering, President Boris
Yeltsin invited his parliamentary foes to the Kremlin to seek their
support for his candidate for prime minister in a key vote Monday.
	   Russia has had an interim government for the past two weeks, and
acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has been struggling to
win confirmation from an opposition-dominated parliament, leaving
little time to devote to the economic crisis.
	   Both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin met with the leaders of the
parliamentary factions at the Kremlin, but the Communists and their
allies insisted they would vote against Chernomyrdin on Monday
afternoon.
	   Yeltsin, in his turn, continued pushing for Chernomyrdin's
approval, said presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
	   The participants adjourned without reaching an agreement and
planned to convene again in the afternoon, before parliament voted
on Chernomyrdin.
	   Speaking after the meeting, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov
reiterated that his faction would vote against Chernomyrdin, but
added that ``it's a dangerous time and we should search for
acceptable solutions.''
	   ``The talk is very tough,'' said Zyuganov, who suggested several
alternative candidates for the prime minister's job. However,
Yeltsin has said he won't nominate anyone besides Chernomyrdin, who
held the post for five years before being dismissed in March.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian ruble slid again on Monday, with the
official rate set over 20 to the U.S. dollar, down from 17 to the
dollar on Friday. The ruble was trading at just over six to the
dollar when the crisis erupted less than a month ago.
	   Parliament overwhelmingly rejected Chernomyrdin a week ago, and
if they vote him down again on Monday, Yeltsin can either
renominate him or another candidate for a third vote, which would
take place in about a week's time.
	   If the Duma rejects the president's candidate on the third vote,
then the constitution calls for the president to dissolve the Duma
and call new elections within three months. Yeltsin would
effectively rule by decree during the interim.
	   Chernomyrdin, speaking on national television Sunday, said he
hoped the Duma would approve his nomination. He compared Russia to
a ship driven toward cliffs by stormy weather, and said the crew
should stop arguing and follow its captain.
	   He also stressed that Russia still wants aid and cooperation
from the West to help ease the economic crisis, which has seen the
ruble collapse and prices soar.
	   ``Russia is now enmeshed in the global financial system, and
this system doesn't want any collapse,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   He said Russia needed to at least double its gold and foreign
currency reserves, ``hopefully through the (assistance) of the
global financial system,'' he said.
	   It was his latest effort to reassure Western governments and
Russian reformers that he hopes to avoid retrenchment into
Soviet-style economic isolation, which some people have predicted.
	   Russia is in the midst of one of its most serious economic and
political crises since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   The economy has been in free fall, with the government devaluing
the ruble and effectively defaulting on foreign loans. Ever since
Yeltsin fired the previous Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko, the country has been groping its way through the crisis
without a government.

Suspected rebel in northern Indonesian province calls for peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A suspected separatist rebel, facing
trial in a northern province where riots erupted last week, said
Monday that he favored a peaceful campaign for independence.
	   The town of Lhoseumawe in Aceh province, on the northern tip of
Sumatra Island, was the scene of widespread rioting last week,
triggered by resentment toward the military. Two people died and
rioters attacked dozens of shops and homes owned by Chinese, a
common scapegoat.
	   Isa bin Muhamad Daud, who is accused of involvement in an
Islamic separatist rebel movement in Aceh, appeared in court Monday
in Bukit Rata, a village on the outskirts of Lhokseumawe.
	   The hearing focused on Daud's legal representation in his trial.
He is accused of buying weapons for the rebels.
	   After the hearing, Daud urged thousands of Acehnese who gathered
outside the courthouse to refrain from violence.
	   ``Don't kill anybody. Please don't burn the Chinese shops,
because that will only make things more difficult,'' he said.
Without elaborating, he said separatists should struggle for
independence through the ``legal process.''
	   Hundreds of riot police and plainclothes officers were on hand.
	   Daud was arrested last year after arriving from Malaysia. He is
accused of being a member of the Free Aceh Movement, a separatist
group that has been targeted by the military over the last decade.
	   Its image sullied by charges of atrocities, the military pulled
troops out of Aceh last month in a conciliatory gesture. But it
sent them back in, citing security concerns because of the riots.
	   Some human rights groups have suggested the armed forces
instigated the riots to justify returning the soldiers. The
military denies the charges.
	   Aceh is one of three Indonesian provinces where separatist
rebels operate. The other two are Irian Jaya, on western New Guinea
Island, and the former Portuguese colony of East Timor.

Official says Japan must study building missile defenses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ North Korea's rocket test last week is forcing
Japan to study building a missile defense system and developing a
satellite to monitor military activities, a governing party
official said Monday.
	   Takashi Fukaya, the Liberal Democratic Party's general council
chairman, said the North Korean launch serves as a reminder that
Japan is vulnerable to attack and must bolster preparedness for a
missile strike.
	   ``Japan has been lucky to enjoy peace for over 50 years, but
peace has been taken for granted, and this is an opportunity to
remind ourselves it shouldn't be,'' Fukaya told reporters.
	   North Korea launched a rocket last Monday that sailed over Japan
and crashed into the Pacific Ocean. U.S. and Japanese officials
have called the firing a ballistic missile test, but the North
claims it was a satellite launch.
	   The Japanese government apparently learned that the second stage
of the projectile flew over Japan from the U.S. military hours
after it happened. That has prompted many Japanese to urge the
government to develop its own monitoring satellite and a system to
destroy incoming missiles in the sky before they reach their
targets.
	   Fukaya said that developing a satellite merely for defense
purposes may be difficult, but that Japan should study building one
that would be able to monitor a variety of ``situations and
information.''
	   He added that Japan would also need to assure other countries
that a buildup in Japanese defense capabilities wouldn't signal a
return to militarism.
	   ``The most important thing is to make sure we don't raise fears
that Japan is moving toward militarism,'' said Fukaya.
	   Asian countries are leery of any signs Japan might be attempting
to increase its military muscle because of its brutal conquest of
East Asia during World War II. China has criticized a proposed
joint U.S.-Japan missile defense project, saying it would stimulate
other countries to spend more on their own defenses.
	   Fukaya said Japan was still trying to confirm North Korea's
claims that it had launched a satellite. But he added that whatever
the hard-line communist state fired, it represented a threat to
Japan's security.
	   ``In any case, there's no mistake (North Korea) launched a
fairly long-distance missile over Japanese skies,'' Fukaya said.
``It caused great fear in Japan and the world.''

Taiwan's trade improves in August
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's exports rose 1.2 percent to U.S.
dlrs 9.65 billion in August, reversing an export contraction of 7.5
percent in the first seven months of the year, the government said
Monday.
	   But imports fell 10 percent to U.S. dlrs 8.31 billion in August
because of reduced purchases of foreign consumer goods and
industrial raw materials, a Finance Ministry report said.
	   If exports continue to expand for two more months, it could
signal that Taiwan has weathered the regional economic crisis,
officials said.
	   Hsu Kuo-chung, the ministry's director of statistics, said
exports need to be expanded further while the government is
spending more on public projects to boost the economy.
	   Exports to the United States, Taiwan's largest market, rose 11
percent in August to U.S. dlrs 2.65 billion, but imports from the
United States fell 16 percent to dlrs 1.42 billion, the report
said.
	   Exports to Hong Kong dropped 0.2 percent to U.S. dlrs 2.18
billion, and imports rose 4.5 percent to dlrs 159.5 million, it
said.
	   Hong Kong is the conduit through which an estimated 80 percent
of Taiwanese goods are traded with China.
	   Imports from Japan fell 8.2 percent in August to U.S. dlrs 2.07
billion, while exports to Japan fell 15 percent to dlrs 754.2
million.

Georgian currency falls sharply
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MISHA DZHINDZHIKHASHVILI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze
sought to reassure his jittery countrymen Monday that the nation's
financial situation was stable despite a sharp fall of the national
currency.
	   Responding to the economic and political crisis in Russia, the
Georgian lari fell to as low as 1.7 to the U.S. dollar on Sunday
afternoon from 1.38 over the previous week.
	   Many Georgians rushed to the exchange points to buy dollars,
fearing a further drop. With prices in stores across the capital
Tbilisi rising by 10 to 20 percent, many also were stocking up on
consumer goods, trying to spend as much devaluing lari as possible.
	   Georgia, a former Soviet republic, had been largely unaffected
by the Russian crisis. But many Georgians are engaged in shuttle
trade or work and have businesses in Russia, and feared that
economic conditions would deteriorate.
	   Shevardnadze, in his traditional radio address Monday, said the
lari's downfall was caused by a ``psychological factor.''
	   ``Upon a detailed analysis we have come to a conclusion that
there are no grounds for the fall of the lari rate,'' he said. ``No
financial hurricanes on the territory of neighboring nations will
damage the lari.''
	   National Bank chief Irakli Managadze also issued assurances and
insisted that the lari was stable.
	   ``That was an artificial rate ... an ordinary speculation that
created panic,'' Managadze said on national television. ``I want to
assure you that today after a trading session at the inter-bank
currency exchange everything will settle down.''
	   Street currency trading, however, remained suspended early
Monday as traders expected the results of the exchange's session to
be announced in the afternoon.

Malta's Labor premier resigns after election seen as EU referendum

<TEXT>
	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ The conservative Nationalist party has
claimed an election victory seen as a mandate for Malta's drive to
join the European Union, ousting the Labor party of Premier Alfred
Sant, who had put the EU bid on hold.
	   Miscalculating that he could win early elections, Sant resigned
after conceding defeat Sunday, even as counting of Saturday's
written balloting for parliament continued.
	   Early Monday, Maltese started to celebrate in the streets. Boys
wore the Nationalist party flag as a cape and girls tied minute
flags around their necks as scarves as they strolled the streets.
	   Scattered traffic jams developed as people drove around in cars
draped with the flags of the winning party and of the European
Union.
	   Nationalist leader Eddie Fenech Adami claimed victory based on
partial results made known to party officials. There was no
immediate indication Monday when complete results would be
announced.
	   Fenech Adami, who pushed for EU entry for this tiny crossroads
in the Mediterranean while premier from 1987-1996, told wildly
cheering supporters: ``The first thing that I am going to do is to
inform the EU that the Maltese people want membership.''
	   His 1987 victory had ended 16 years of Labor governments whose
then pro-Libyan stands often angered Western governments.
	   Sant had contended that Malta's economy, which includes
government protection for industry and a large state sector, wasn't
ready for the economic discipline required by Brussels.
	   The Nationalists said EU funds would pay for such projects as
roads to help Malta's biggest money-maker_tourism.
	   Sant had gambled that calling elections three years early would
strengthen his socialists' one-vote majority in the 65-seat
parliament.
	   Nationalist sources said the party had about 52 percent of the
vote, with Labor getting roughly 4 percent less than that.
	   Shops and businesses stayed closed on Monday for fear of
post-election violence. The Maltese are very passionate about their
political leanings, with roughly half the country diehard
Nationalists and the other half pro-Labor.
	   But compared to previous elections, streets had relatively few
numbers of horn-honking, drum-beating, fireworks-exploding
supporters. It was unclear whether supporters were respecting calls
by both winners and losers for calm or whether a televised
Malta-Macedonia soccer match kept many Maltese at home.

Financial secretary defends intervention, proposes new regulations

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The financial secretary said Monday the
government's recent intervention in the stock market had prevented
a dangerous spike in interest rates that could have severely
damaged Hong Kong's banking system.
	   At a special briefing in the legislature, Donald Tsang also
proposed new measures to deter market speculators. A series of
steps were introduced last week to tighten reins on speculative
trading and boost liquidity in the banking sector.
	   This was the first time legislators had been briefed on the
government's foray into the financial markets in mid-August.
	   Although most lawmakers supported the move, some were
dissatisfied that they had not been informed beforehand.
	   Without intervention, interbank interest rates could have jumped
to 50 percent and the stock market could have shed up to 3,000
points from its five-year low of 6,660.42, Tsang told legislators,
minutes after he walked past dozens of protesters against the
intervention.
	   Interest rates at that level would force banks to further reduce
lending and many would suffer additional losses from loan defaults.
	   Higher interest rates and lower stock prices also would severely
damage public confidence and hit the pockets of many Hong Kong
people who have property mortgages and stock investments.
	   Tsang outlined 30 additional measures to tighten rules against
market manipulation, which would maintain order and improve
transparency in the markets.
	   Among the proposals was one to create a body to oversee all
public bodies in the stock and futures markets.
	   Tsang also proposed giving power to the territory's chief
executive to give orders to the stock and futures exchanges and the
stock clearing houses.
	   This would ``ensure that the government can react quickly
whenever public interests are under threat,'' a government
statement said.
	   The government used an estimated 15 percent of the territory's
U.S. dlrs 96 billion in reserves to buy stocks to lift the market
to a level where speculators who bet the market would go down were
stuck with huge losses.
	   Officials had said the move was to punish speculators who have
been trying to break Hong Kong's currency peg to the U.S. dollar by
driving up interest rates and depressing the stock market at the
same time.
	   Tsang told legislators the 14-month-old financial crisis in Asia
and a host of external and internal factors in July ``presented a
perfect opportunity for market riggers.''
	   In July, the U.S. dollar surged above 140 Japanese yen to the
dollar, Wall Street fell, many Hong Kong companies reported losses
and the local stock market turnover hit record lows.
	   ``We are not the only ones caught by surprise, the whole world
was caught by surprise,'' he said of the Asian crisis and its
contagion across global markets.
	   Tsang said it was his decision to intervene, but he later
consulted with Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and other officials
and informed the Chinese government.
	   Tsang declined to disclose how much the government has spent on
stocks. Market players estimate it could have spent about U.S. dlrs
15 billion.
	   Emily Lau, leader of the small, populist Frontier group, said:
``We have a right to know the amount of money spent. People in the
market know.''
	   Government measures to stabilize the linked exchange rate,
announced over the weekend, sent the blue-chip Hang Seng Index
soaring to 8,076.76, up 7.8 percent, at the close Monday.

After grenade attack, Hun Sen orders arrests, end to protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with embassies told to deny refuge, opponents warned
not to leave country, 8th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Accusing the political opposition of
launching a grenade attack against his house Monday, strongman Hun
Sen said his most bitter opponent would be arrested and ordered an
end to weeks of protest against his rule.
	   The attack set the stage for a violent end to the worsening
confrontation between Hun Sen and the opposition leaders, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, since disputed parliamentary
elections July 26.
	   Hun Sen, who was not at home during the attack, rejected
speculation at a news conference that he had staged the incident to
crack down on opponents. But he left little doubt he was looking to
reassert his authority.
	   ``The arrests are to start from this hour,'' Hun Sen said. ``How
many people will be arrested is up to prosecutors to decide. We
urge the people who are to be arrested not to resist.''
	   Hun Sen said there was ``already a request'' for the immediate
arrest of Sam Rainy, his most strident opponent and chief leader of
round-the-clock anti-Hun Sen protests entering their third week.
	   Hun Sen branded Sam Rainsy a ``terrorist.''
	   Ranariddh, whom Hun Sen deposed as co-prime minister in a bloody
coup last year, could also be arrested, Hun Sen said.
	   Embassies were warned against granting them refuge and Hun Sen
said they would not be allowed to leave the country.
	   The protesters were given until midnight to pack up their tents,
mats and cooking gear and clear out from the park opposite the
National Assembly they call ``Democracy Square.''
	   ``We have to return public and social order to the citizens of
Phnom Penh,'' Hun Sen said.
	   Police patrolled in force around the park, but there was no
immediate move against the crowd.
	   Sam Rainsy was huddled with United Nations officials. His party
said any arrest would not be based on evidence and would violate an
agreement Hun Sen had with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The agreement allows opposition leaders who fled Cambodia in the
wake of last year's coup to return to freely contest the elections.
	   Police said two grenades were thrown from one or two passing
motorcycles over the gates of Hun Sen's residence in the capital.
No one was hurt. Hun Sen told reporters that family members,
including his father, were not home at the time.
	   Police said two Chinese-made grenades had exploded. A third that
failed to detonate was found by explosives experts nearby. The only
damage appeared to be a shattered window.
	   Hun Sen seldom stays at the residence, preferring his
fortress-like compound outside the capital.
	   There were no arrests, but Hok Lundy, the national police chief,
lost no time in labeling the attack an ``assassination attempt''
and threatening opposition leaders with arrest.
	   The attack underscored the failure of three days of talks
mediated by King Norodom Sihanouk to find a settlement between Hun
Sen's party and the opposition over the outcome of the elections.
	   Sihanouk, 75, the prince's father, issued a statement ``to
express my deep sorrow about the disgraceful act the terrorists
have committed toward the prime minister.''
	   Hun Sen signaled that the attack marked the end of his patience
and called it ``the true nature of a coup d'etat.''
	   ``They called for soldiers, police to shoot me, to overthrow me.
They called on the U.S. to fire missiles at my house,'' said Hun
Sen, referring to Sam Rainsy.
	   ``But when he could not succeed, he used this act of
terrorism,'' Hun Sen said. ``So I think it has come to a stage
where legal action must be taken against this terrorist leader.''
	   The opposition contends Hun Sen, who has dominated Cambodian
politics since 1985, won the elections by fraud. It has threatened
to deny him the needed two-thirds majority to form a new
government. On his own, Hun Sen controls only 64 of the 122 seats.
	   On March 30, 1997, four grenades were hurled into a protest led
by Sam Rainsy at the same park. At least 16 people were killed and
more than 100 wounded, including Sam Rainsy. The attack was widely
blamed on Hun Sen. He has denied responsibility.
	   Two weeks ago, a grenade was hurled at the headquarters of the
National Election Commission, where Sam Rainsy was protesting the
elections. One person died.
	   No one has ever been arrested or prosecuted.

Wage deal ends Israel's public sector strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A five-day strike of Israel's 300,000 public
sector employees ended Monday after the Histadrut Trade Union
Federation and the Treasury agreed on a 1.5 percent wage increase.
	   The deal averted a shutdown of Ben-Gurion International Airport
at the last minute. The Histadrut had threatened to widen its
strike and close the airport Monday morning.
	   The strike has disrupted life in Israel since last week. In Tel
Aviv, garbage piled up in the streets Sunday as municipal
sanitation workers joined the stoppage. All government offices,
post offices, railroads and seaports were closed.
	   Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman has said the wage increases
demanded by the unions would cause runaway inflation. Histadrut
leader Amid Peretz accused Neeman of scaring the public with
figures many times greater than the real cost of the increases.
	   The agreement does not affect school teachers who have been on
strike for the past eight days and have conducted separate
negotiations. A new round of talks between the teachers' union and
the Treasury was to be held later Monday.

Unpaid workers demonstrate in southwestern China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Five hundred state factory workers, unpaid for
four months, broke a police line Monday and marched in protest
through an impoverished southwestern Chinese city, a rights group
reported.
	   The workers demanded back pay and shouted slogans decrying waste
and corruption by state factory managers as they marched through
Dujiangyan in Sichuan province, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   Officials with the Chengdu city government, which oversees
Dujiangyan, confirmed the protest but refused to provide details.
	   The Information Center gave the following account: At 11:30
a.m., 500 workers from the Min River Timber Machinery Factory
gathered near a bridge in the city's center and began to march.
Dozens of police tried to block them from a main thoroughfare. But
the angry demonstrators pushed through and police did not try to
use force to stop them.
	   Two trends converged in sparking the unrest, the third
demonstration by angry workers in Dujiangyan in 13 months.
	   The city, a famous scenic spot in Sichuan's western foothills,
60 kilometers (35 miles) northwest of Chengdu, is home to many
bankrupt state industries. Throughout China, hundreds of protests
have erupted as uncompetitive state industries founder on
capitalist market reforms.
	   In the case of Min River Timber, the money-losing venture was
serving a logging industry in severe decline after decades of
unrestrained clear-cutting of forests.
	   Last week, the government imposed a ban on logging in western
Sichuan to stop the environmental damage that compounded disastrous
flooding this summer.
	   Workers from the 2,000-employee Min River Timber appealed many
times to the Dujiangyan government about their owed wages, but
never received a reply, the Information Center said.

Tokyo stocks soar, dollar tumbles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; ADDS trader comment in 6th graf; UPDATES with closing
bond, late afternoon dollar &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks soared Monday in their
second-largest gain of the year as lawmakers edged closer to an
agreement on a banking system bailout and other Asian markets
rallied. The dollar tumbled against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at
14,790.06, up 747.15 points, or 5.32 percent _ the most it has
gained in one day since Jan. 16. On Friday, the average had lost
218.33 points, or 1.53 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar bought 131.99 yen in late afternoon, down
3.42 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and below its late New York
level of 133.57 yen Friday.
	   The twin gains by Japan's currency and stocks offered a brief
glimmer of hope to a country grown accustomed to grim news about
its economy.
	   But traders were quick to say that it was too early for optimism
about a sustained rally in the world's second-largest financial
markets. Economic growth remains stagnant, and consumer spending
shows no sign of recovery.
	   ``The fundamentals haven't changed, but sentiment has,'' said
Ryohei Muramatsu, treasury manager at Commerzbank in Tokyo.
	   Still, lawmakers from the governing party and the opposition
appeared to be nearing compromise on a plan to use public money to
clean up what many consider Japan's biggest problem: the bad loans
burdening its banks.
	   A Liberal Democratic Party official was quoted Monday as saying
his party was willing to accept opposition demands for greater
disclosure from banks. A lead opposition group, the New Peace
Party, has signaled it will back LDP bills if such disclosure is
required.
	   Investors in Japan also welcomed the strong showing by stock
markets across Asia, which is their country's largest export
market. Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed the morning
session up 7.6 percent, and Malaysia's Composite Index jumped 26
percent before noon.
	   An estimated 503 million shares traded on the first section of
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from Friday's 448 million. Gainers
overwhelmed decliners about 5-to-1.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the exchange rose 38.18 points, or 3.49 percent,
to 1,132.65. It had declined 19.30 points, or 1.73 percent, Friday.
	   The yen surged to a four-month high against the dollar on new
signs investors won't earn the kinds of returns they used to in
U.S. assets.
	   On Friday, U.S. central bank chairman Alan Greenspan hinted at a
possible cut in interest rates to keep the American economy from
slipping into recession because of global economic problems. The
Dow Jones industrial average is already off almost 2,000 points
from its 1998 high.
	   The yen's sustained strength surprised many, who thought the
rally would soon sputter because of the Japanese economy's weak
fundamentals. The gains have sent many investors scurrying to dump
their weakening dollars _ driving the Japanese currency up even
further.
	   ``People who want to lock in profits are rushing to sell off the
dollar, and although we've been expecting such selling to subside,
it hasn't, so people are panicking,'' said Takuma Kurosawa, chief
foreign exchange manager at Mitsubishi Trust and Banking.
	   The yen traded as low as 134.67 yen to the dollar and as high as
131.45 yen. The dollar hasn't been below 132 yen since May 6.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.040 percent from Friday's finish of 1.070 percent,
driving its price up to 112.83 yen from 112.61 yen.

U.S. planes will airdrop food packets for flood victims

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Two U.S. air force C-130 transport
planes will airdrop food this week to tens of thousands of flood
victims in Bangladesh.
	   The transport planes carrying nearly 40 U.S. air force personnel
are scheduled to arrive in Bangladesh on Thursday for a military
exercise, Mustafizur Rahman, a top bureaucrat at Dhaka's foreign
office, said in a telephone interview.
	   ``The joint military exercise this year will concentrate on
flood disaster relief,'' Rahman said.
	   Much of Bangladesh has been flooded since monsoon rains began on
July 10. High water has displaced or marooned at least 30 million
people _ one fourth of the delta nation's population.
	   Hopes of an early respite receded Monday with weather forecasts
saying more rain is expected.
	   Rahman said Dhaka accepted Washington's offer that U.S. Air
Force troops arriving for a military exercise help providing food
to tens of thousands of displaced poor people.
	   The flood crest at the River Ganges, one of the country's
largest rivers, topped 15.04 meters (45.12 feet) on Monday,
surpassing the previous highest recorded in 1910, the state-run
Water Development Board said.
	   This year's floods have killed at least 800 people and
Bangladesh has appealed for dlrs 879 million in international aid
to buy food and medicine.
	   The U.S. and other donors have promised dlrs 85 million in cash
and food aid, the government said, while the United Nations has
appealed for dlrs 223 million to help Bangladesh.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After hearing ``chilling'' reports
about atrocities in Kosovo, the State Department's top human rights
official was expected Monday to press Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic for an independent investigation in the province.
	   John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for human rights,
and former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole were to meet Milosevic following a
weekend fact-finding tour of the besieged Serbian province, U.S.
diplomats here said.
	   The Americans and Europeans have tried for months to get
Milosevic to halt his offensive in Kosovo, where hundreds of people
have died and an estimated 265,000 have been driven from their
homes in a crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   But the efforts have taken on new urgency with colder weather
arriving and as many as 50,000 people living in the open, left
homeless from the fighting. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
main Yugoslav republic.
	   Dole, who heads the International Commission for Missing
Persons, warned Sunday in the Kosovo capital of Pristina that the
situation is ``rapidly developing into a humanitarian catastrophe
of tremendous proportions.''
	   Dole, who lost the U.S. presidency to Bill Clinton in 1996, said
the suffering of Kosovo people will ``increase dramatically'' as
winter approaches.
	   ``We also heard testimony from eyewitnesses to some of the
crimes and atrocities,'' he said. ``These accounts were chilling.''
	   Shattuck emphasized that Washington wants forensic investigators
to determine the truth behind allegations of atrocities leveled by
both sides, not just against Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians.
	   He made clear the credibility of Serb claims will suffer if they
don't allow outsiders in to verify responsibility for such
incidents as the alleged killing last month of 22 Serb civilians by
Kosovo Liberation Army rebels.
	   Forensics doctors, he said, have been ready and waiting for
months but haven't been granted Yugoslav visas.
	   ``To throw around these kinds of allegations and not allow
independent forensics investigations is absurd,'' Shattuck said.
	   Milosevic and ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova
agreed last week on a U.S.-mediated framework agreement under which
they would negotiate self-rule for Kosovo. But the secessionist
rebels have not endorsed it, and are unlikely to if Serb forces
continue burning houses and shelling villages.
	   Dole said the Yugoslav president must be ready for a cease-fire
or limited pullback in the next 30 to 60 days.
	   ``If Milosevic believes nothing will happen, he will be making a
big mistake,'' he said in response to a question about possible
Western military intervention.
	   In Salzburg, Austria, European Union foreign ministers decided
to implement a long-proposed ban on flights by the Yugoslav
national carrier JAT to the 15 EU member countries after overcoming
objections from Greece, which maintains close relations with
Belgrade.
	   The Yugoslav state television, a Milosevic mouthpiece, described
the decision as ``open support for terrorism in Kosovo.''
	   But the foreign ministers failed to name a Kosovo envoy to
supplement the shuttle diplomacy of Christopher Hill, the American
envoy, who has cobbled together a tentative peace deal.
	   ``It cannot be right that Hill takes care of these things,''
said German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. ``I think we (the EU)
need to show the flag more in Kosovo.''

Indonesian students tear down Parliament gates in anti-government
</HEADLINE>
protest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of student protesters tore
down the gates of Parliament and threw plastic bottles at police
Monday during a demonstration against President B.J. Habibie.
	   Chanting anti-government slogans, at least 2,000 students
gathered outside the green-domed building to demand that Habibie
quit because of his handling of Indonesia's economic crisis.
	   They ripped down the gates, but hundreds of riot police blocked
the demonstrators from entering the grounds. Police also closed off
the main highway in front of the building, where protesters milled,
dressed in brightly colored university jackets.
	   With permission from the military, students occupied Parliament
in the days before former President Suharto quit in May, camping
out and daubing the walls with pro-democracy graffiti. Soldiers
evicted them after Suharto's resignation.
	   Habibie is implementing democratic reforms, and has scheduled
general elections next year. Although he is dismantling the legacy
of his autocratic predecessor, there is widespread discontent over
Indonesia's shattered economy.
	   Student demonstrators urged the government to lower the prices
of rice and other basic commodities, which have soared over the
past year. Unemployment is also high, and the economy is expected
to shrink by as much as 15 percent this year.
	   ``Habibie is no good because he can't lower the price of staple
foods,'' said protester Mito Parar. ``That's why we demand again
and again before the Parliament that Habibie step down.''
	   Student protests in recent weeks have lacked the intensity of
the near-daily rallies that helped oust Suharto after 32 years in
power.

Indonesia's attorney general says no overseas holdings of Suharto

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's attorney general said
Monday that his office's investigations into the assets of former
President Suharto have not yet found any overseas holdings.
	   Attorney General Muhammad Andi Ghalib also said his office sees
no reason to call the former president in for questioning, as
probes into five foundations chaired by Suharto have provided all
the details necessary for the investigation.
	   ``The investigation into the foundations, including trying to
trace Suharto's assets overseas, will continue,'' Ghalib said. The
investigation started three months ago.
	   In an appearance on national television Sunday, the 77-year-old
Suharto denied accusations that he siphoned off funds from five
charitable foundations for his own use.
	   Ghalib said Suharto's remarks would not ``influence the
investigations.''
	   Following Suharto's resignation in May, there have been growing
calls for him to provide details on his wealth. Critics allege that
Suharto, his family and associates contributed to Indonesia's
economic crisis by using their connections to build monopolies,
often at state expense.
	   Suharto has said he doesn't have assets held overseas in his
name, and has challenged critics to find any, in which case he will
``sign them over.''
	   He quit after riots and student protests dislodged his hold on
power. Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, has promised to
undo his mentor's authoritarian legacy, scheduling general
elections next year and vowing to promote accountability in the
government.
	   Also Monday, a former trade minister and longtime associate of
Suharto testified at police headquarters about alleged misuse of
central bank funds. Last week, Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan told
government prosecutors that he used Bank Indonesia funds earmarked
for a bank he owns to finance part of his paper industry.

passengers had been affected by canceled flights out of Japan as of
Monday.
	   ``The (revenue) loss is enormous,'' said Koji Nagata, a
spokesman for Northwest. He did not specify exactly how much the
company has lost because of a 10-day-old strike by its pilots.
	   Northwest is the second largest airline to fly out of Japan, and
the biggest among foreign airlines, with around 200 flights per
week.
	   As of Monday, Northwest had canceled all U.S. domestic flights
and all U.S.-departing international flights through Sept. 9,
Nagata said. In addition, all flights originating in Asia and in
Europe have been canceled through Sept. 11, he said.
	   Over the weekend, negotiators from Northwest and the Air Line
Pilots Association, the union representing the striking pilots, met
separately. The two sides are expected to meet again Tuesday,
Nagata said.
	   Altogether, Northwest has contracted with more than 60 airlines
to accept passengers on its canceled flights, the airline said.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The number of job openings has fallen short of
job seekers for the first time since the 1980s recession, and
unemployment will worsen during the rest of the year, Singapore's
Ministry of Manpower said Monday.
	   The head of the ministry, Lee Boon Yang, told Parliament Friday
that the actual unemployment rate in June was 3.2 percent, up from
2.4 percent the previous year.
	   ``Total employment shrank in the (second) quarter, the first
contraction since the last economic recession,'' the ministry said
in announcing its program for dealing with increased joblessness.
	   Calling it the ``4R strategy,'' the ministry said it would focus
on redeployment of displaced workers, renewing the work force with
new skills, realigning employment practices with such measures as
shortening work weeks and increasing part-time jobs, and
revitalizing job creation by attracting industries with growth
potential.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada has ordered
the rapid sale of two government-seized television stations and a
popular newspaper chain to reduce a swelling budget deficit, an
official said Monday.
	   The media companies are among a variety of corporations that
were seized from close associates of the late dictator Ferdinand
Marcos after his ouster 12 years ago.
	   The government hopes this year to auction the two TV stations _
Intercontinental Broadcasting Corp. and Radio Philippines Network _
and the Journal group of companies, which publishes tabloids, Press
Secretary Rod Reyes said.
	   Estrada has ordered the companies to coordinate with government
agencies to draw up auction plans, Reyes said.
	   However, in most cases the former owners of the companies have
challenged the seizures in court, and ownership questions must be
settled before the government can proceed with the sales.
	   Last December, the Supreme Court blocked a scheduled auction of
IBC after a petition was filed questioning the government's right
to sell it.
	   After turning a small surplus in 1997, the government's budget
is expected to slide into a deficit of 40 billion pesos (dlrs 930
million) this year, according to government officials. The
International Monetary Fund has projected, however, that the
deficit could reach 50 billion pesos (dlrs 1.2 billion).

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's massive infrastructure spending plans
this year will spur a recovery in the country's slowing economic
growth and help it reach a gross domestic product growth of 8.1
percent in 1998, state media said Monday.
	   That would be above the government-set target of 8 percent GDP
growth for the year, a level officials say is necessary to create
jobs and prevent social unrest.
	   China's economic growth should speed up in the second half of
the year, after bottoming out at the end of the first half, when
GDP grew only 7 percent, said the China Securities Times, citing
results from a Beijing symposium on this year's economic situation.
	   Since the end of June, the government's policies to stimulate
demand by increasing fixed-asset investment have taken effect, the
newspaper said. China's fixed-asset investment grew 15.6 percent in
the first seven months of the year, with July's growth surging 22.8
percent.
	   The government also aims to have 10 percent growth in property
sales this year, the report said.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's state-run Korea Telecom
said Monday it will lay off 9,625, or 16 percent, of its 59,491
employees by the year 2001 as part of its restructuring and
privatization effort.
	   This year, the domestic phone monopoly has dismissed 2,444
through early retirement, it said.
	   In its restructuring plan announced earlier Monday, Korea
Telecom said it will reduce its debt-to-equity ratio of 218 percent
to below 200 percent by the end of this year and to 100 percent by
2002 by offering rights issues, selling off its assets including
real estate holdings, and lowering costs.
	   Korea Telecom also plans to reduce the number of its phone
offices to 80 from 260 to trim its size.
	   It also plans to remove 612 of its 5,470 employees at its nine
affiliate companies by 2000 as part of its privatization effort, it
said.
	   Moreover, Korea Telecom said it hopes to raise its sales to 14.3
trillion won (dlrs 10.7 billion) by 2002 to become the 10th largest
communications company in the world. Its sales were 7.78 trillion
won (dlrs 5.8 billion) in 1997.
	   In early August, the Planning and Budget Commission said it will
privatize state-run companies and cut work forces at the state-run
companies through restructuring.

Israel denies siding with Turkey against Greece in Cyprus dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's defense minister on Monday denied
reports that Israel was being asked to side with Turkey against
Greece in the dispute over Cyprus.
	   Israel army radio said in an unattributed report that visiting
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was asking Israel for military
assistance in case war breaks out with Greece over control of
Cyprus.
	   Mesut, who is on a two-day visit to Israel, was to meet with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu later Monday.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said that while
Israeli-Turkish military ties were close, they should not be
considered a threat by other countries.
	   ``We are not doing anything with Turkey against any other
country in the Middle East, certainly not against Cyprus or any
other country,'' Mordechai told reporters.
	   In July, a Turkish newspaper reported that Turkish warplanes
conducted assault exercises in Israel against Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles _ the same weapons system Greek Cypriots
plan to deploy later this year. Israel denied the report at the
time as ``baseless.''
	   Cyprus has been divided since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded
the Mediterranean island after an abortive coup that aimed to unite
the island with Greece.
	   Turkey and Israel have been developing strategic ties since
1996, exchanging warplanes for training, conducting naval maneuvers
and signing several defense and trade deals.
	   Several countries in the region, especially Syria, Egypt and
Greece, have been following the growing ties with concern.
	   Last month, Netanyahu said he believed the Israeli-Turkish
relationship could be the basis for a regional defense structure.
	   However, Turkey was quick to pour cold water on Netanyahu's
proposal.
	   The Turkish ambassador to Israel, Barlas Oezner, said in
response that such a regional alliance could only be formed once
Israel had negotiated peace agreements with its Arab neighbors.
	   ``We need to go step by step,'' Oezner told the Haaretz daily
last week. ``First, there have to be conditions of peace in this
region before we can go further and create a regional framework.''
	   The Turkish prime minister is accompanied by dozens of business
leaders and hopes to expand trade ties with Israel.

South Korea approves Hyundai's tourism project in North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government approval process for tourists to visit
North Korea, grafs 13-15 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The government on Monday approved
plans by the Hyundai business group to start sightseeing tours of a
scenic mountain in North Korea later this month.
	   Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate, hopes to send up to
2,000 tourists a week on two luxury cruise ships beginning Sept.
25.
	   ``All except some minor details have been set, and the first
ship will be able to depart as scheduled,'' Kim Jong-su, a Hyundai
spokesman, said.
	   The tourism project would mark the first major joint venture
between the two hostile Korean states and give Pyongyang a new
source of badly needed foreign currency.
	   Visitors will be allowed to hike Diamond Mountain on North
Korea's east coast, and travel outside the mountain will be
strictly banned.
	   Tourists will return to their ships at the end of each day,
Hyundai officials said.
	   North Korea already has approved Hyundai's plan to spend dlrs
95.8 million to build a berthing facility at a port near the
mountain and construct restaurants and other facilities.
	   South Korean officials estimate that North Korea can earn up to
dlrs 100 million a year in hard currency from the tours, which
Hyundai hopes will attract about 360,000 tourists a year.
	   The first 500-room cruiser, chartered from Malaysia, arrived in
South Korea Monday. The second ship will arrive in two weeks,
Hyundai said.
	   The ships will pick up tourists in South Korea's Donghae port on
the east coast and transport them to North Korea's Changjon port.
From there, tourists will travel to the mountain by bus.
	   Hyundai will charge each tourist about dlrs 1,000 for the
five-day trip, including dlrs 300 to be paid to North Korea for
visa processing and using North Korean facilities.
	   The Seoul government said North Korea has agreed to guarantee
the safety of the tourists and form a joint rescue squad with
Hyundai in case of emergencies.
	   The government said people applying for the tours will be
screened by South Korea's intelligence agency, a process that will
take about 15 days.
	   ``We believe that applicants will be given approval unless they
are pending trial or something like that,'' said Lee Kang-jin, a
spokesman for the Unification Ministry.
	   Once approved, tourists will receive identification cards that
will replace passports during their stay in North Korea.
	   The Korean Peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. They fought a three-year war in the
early 1950s. Their border is sealed, with 2 million troops deployed
on both sides.

U.N. rights chief begins China mission, gets calls for help

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Saying she hopes to work with China to promote
human rights, U.N. rights chief Mary Robinson began a visit Monday
by signing an agreement on technical cooperation between her office
and the government.
	   Robinson's visit is the first mission by a U.N. human rights
commissioner to China.
	   ``I hope to contribute to the awareness of human rights among
the Chinese public and demonstrate my interest in and support of
issues of their concern,'' she said at a signing ceremony.
	   She said her 10-day mission was ``an opportunity to begin a
serious process of cooperation'' and that she hoped to work with
the government to find ``practical ways to promote and protect
human rights.''
	   The document signed Monday says that if asked, the U.N. human
rights office would offer China help in developing a national plan
of action as called for by the Vienna World Conference on Human
Rights and fulfilling its obligations under international treaties.
	   Robinson earlier said she wants to learn China's intentions on
the two main international rights covenants.
	   China signed the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights last year, but the legislature has not ratified it.
The Communist-ruled government also pledged six months ago to
accede to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
but has not done so.
	   The two covenants are intended to provide baseline guarantees of
such fundamental rights as free speech and assembly, including the
right to form trade unions.
	   Although China's constitution gives citizens those rights, they
are seldom protected in practice. Aggrieved dissidents and their
family members were hoping that Robinson's visit might encourage
improvements.
	   Robinson's schedule includes a trip, beginning Thursday, to
Tibet, where there have been many accusations of rights abuses.
	   The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement
in China, a Hong Kong-based group, said Monday that dissidents and
families of imprisoned activists had entrusted it with open letters
to pass on to her.
	   One of the letters, signed by 139 democracy campaigners,
protested the sentencing of Zhao Changqing, a teacher in northern
China's Shaanxi province who tried to run for local office, to
three years in prison for disrupting social order.
	   Xu Hong of Shanghai wrote on behalf of her husband, Lin Hai, a
software company director detained since March on a charge of
inciting to overthrow state power for giving 30,000 Chinese e-mail
addresses to a dissident on-line magazine.
	   Government critic Chu Hailan also wrote Robinson requesting a
meeting and her help in getting her husband, labor rights
campaigner Liu Nianchun, released from a labor camp.
	   Others protested the right of police to send detainees to labor
camps for up to four years without trial; the authorities' failure
to let an activist facing a charge of subversion see a lawyer; and
the government's refusal to let dissidents in exile return to
China.

Boeing, Airbus square off at Farnborough air show
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ Under the rumble of jet engines, the
world's aerospace companies opened their top air show of the year
Monday, amid expectations they would announce billions of dollars
in new business.
	   The Farnborough International 98 show promised to feature more
intense rivalry between the two biggest airplane manufacturers _
the Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie _ although analysts warn that a
current sales boom is soon to falter as the business slips into a
down cycle.
	   Airbus, the European airplane-making consortium from Britain,
France, Germany and Spain, landed at Farnborough on an optimistic
note, after recently selling its first-ever batch of jets to
British Airways and signing a big deal with US Airways.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair, ceremoniously opening the
show, praised the British Airways purchase as ``a real
demonstration of confidence in Airbus,'' which has been working for
years to take market share away from Boeing, its bigger U.S.
competitor based in Seattle.
	   Boeing has had more visible problems lately, including the
recent removal of Ron Woodard, president of its commercial airplane
group, after costly problems on the assembly line.
	   His replacement, Alan Mulally, will not be at Farnborough
because of prior commitments, Boeing's press office said Monday.
	   The aerospace companies are enjoying a bumper year, with
airlines filling their jets with passengers and busily expanding
their fleets.
	   But good times typically lead to bad times in the up-and-down
world of aviation, and analysts predict that the strong sales will
soon give way to a sharp decline.
	   The Asian crisis will make the bust come quicker and with more
severity than some experts had previously predicted.
	   Executives at Boeing have estimated that sales could drop off by
about 10 percent in 2000 _ but outside analysts see a much sharper
drop, with industrywide sales plunging by as much as 20 percent to
25 percent that year.
	   Despite widespread predictions of a downturn, analysts say it
won't be as bad as the crisis that struck the industry in the early
1990s, after the Gulf War and the last recession dried up demand
for air travel.
	   The airlines got themselves seriously overextended in the late
1980s boom, making the inevitable sales decline even harsher than
normal. This time, the airlines have not been quite so ambitious
about expanding theit fleets, so the drop will be less painful,
experts say.

Hong Kong stocks soar as new measures boost liquidity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with new government proposals, closing
figures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong shares surged Monday, with the key
index soaring nearly 8 percent following new government measures to
deter market speculators.
	   The key Hang Seng Index rose 588.29 points, or 7.9 percent,
closing at 8,076.76. On Friday, the index had gained 169.88 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 9.76 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.26 billion), up from Friday's 6.85 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 878 million.
	   Brokers said prices rose after the government announced measures
Monday to curb breaches of securities regulations, including
heavier penalties for illegal short selling of shares.
	   On Saturday, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority also announced
measures to strengthen the Hong Kong dollar's 15-year-old currency
link to the U.S. dollar, which has come under repeated speculative
attacks.
	   One of the new measures is a guarantee that the authority would
lend money to banks at 7.75 Hong Kong dollars per U.S. dollar,
which would boost bank liquidity.
	   To weaken the currency peg, speculators have been trying to
drive up local interest rates. They hoped higher interest rates
would depress the stock market, and they could profit from placing
market bets in the stock futures market that share prices would go
down.
	   Last month, the government spent billions of Hong Kong dollars
to buy stocks to counter pressure from speculators, who were
driving share prices down.
	   Banks and investors generally welcomed the new measures Monday.
	   Investors ``now think at least for the foreseeable future
interest rates will come down, and it will be more difficult for
speculators to attack the Hong Kong dollar,'' said Percy Au-Young,
sales director at DBS Securities in Hong Kong.
	   Among gainers, HSBC Holdings rose 5.50 Hong Kong dollars to
159.50, Cheung Kong rose 4.30 dollars to 34.70, Sun Hung Kai
Properties rose 3.10 dollars to 26.60, and Hang Seng Bank rose 1.80
dollars to 45.50.

U.S.-Swiss microbiologist among Swissair victims, colleagues say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Thomas Kreis, a U.S.-Swiss microbiology expert,
was among the victims of the Flight 111 crash, colleagues and
family announced Monday. He was 46.
	   Kreis was named director of the University of Geneva's
Department of Cellular Biology last July after pursuing research at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Weizmann Institute in
Israel and the European Laboratory of Molecular Biology at
Heidelberg, Germany.
	   ``The work of Thomas Kreis shed light on essential aspects of
cellular life, and this fundamental new knowledge directly
interested the entire biomedical field,'' said a tribute by four
Geneva colleagues in the daily Tribune de Geneve.
	   He edited books and journals and was recognized by international
scientific organizations, but also was athletic and was a qualified
Swiss ski instructor.
	   Kreis, who was by Swissair as having U.S. citizenship, was born
in Switzerland. He is survived by his wife, Donna St. George Kreis,
and two children.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After hearing ``chilling'' reports
about atrocities in Kosovo, the State Department's top human rights
official was expected Monday to press Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic for an independent investigation in the province.
	   John Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for human rights,
and former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole were to meet Milosevic following a
weekend fact-finding tour of the besieged Serbian province, U.S.
diplomats here said.
	   The Americans and Europeans have tried for months to get
Milosevic to halt his offensive in Kosovo, where hundreds of people
have died and an estimated 265,000 have been driven from their
homes in a crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   But the efforts have taken on new urgency with colder weather
arriving and as many as 50,000 people living in the open, left
homeless from the fighting. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
main Yugoslav republic.
	   Dole, who heads the International Commission for Missing
Persons, warned Sunday in the Kosovo capital of Pristina that the
situation is ``rapidly developing into a humanitarian catastrophe
of tremendous proportions.''
	   Dole, who lost the U.S. presidency to Bill Clinton in 1996, said
the suffering of Kosovo people will ``increase dramatically'' as
winter approaches.
	   ``We also heard testimony from eyewitnesses to some of the
crimes and atrocities,'' he said. ``These accounts were chilling.''
	   Shattuck emphasized that Washington wants forensic investigators
to determine the truth behind allegations of atrocities leveled by
both sides, not just against Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians.
	   He made clear the credibility of Serb claims will suffer if they
don't allow outsiders in to verify responsibility for such
incidents as the alleged killing last month of 22 Serb civilians by
Kosovo Liberation Army rebels.
	   Forensics doctors, he said, have been ready and waiting for
months but haven't been granted Yugoslav visas.
	   ``To throw around these kinds of allegations and not allow
independent forensics investigations is absurd,'' Shattuck said.
	   Milosevic and ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova
agreed last week on a U.S.-mediated framework agreement under which
they would negotiate self-rule for Kosovo. But the secessionist
rebels have not endorsed it, and are unlikely to if Serb forces
continue burning houses and shelling villages.
	   Dole said the Yugoslav president must be ready for a cease-fire
or limited pullback in the next 30 to 60 days.
	   ``If Milosevic believes nothing will happen, he will be making a
big mistake,'' he said in response to a question about possible
Western military intervention.
	   In Salzburg, Austria, European Union foreign ministers decided
to implement a long-proposed ban on flights by the Yugoslav
national carrier JAT to the 15 EU member countries after overcoming
objections from Greece, which maintains close relations with
Belgrade.
	   The Yugoslav state television, a Milosevic mouthpiece, described
the decision as ``open support for terrorism in Kosovo.''
	   But the foreign ministers failed to name a Kosovo envoy to
supplement the shuttle diplomacy of Christopher Hill, the American
envoy, who has cobbled together a tentative peace deal.
	   ``It cannot be right that Hill takes care of these things,''
said German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. ``I think we (the EU)
need to show the flag more in Kosovo.''

Minister: 60 AIDS cases reported in Kuwait over 20 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Sixty Kuwaitis have contracted AIDS in the last 20
years, the lowest infection rate in the region, the health minister
said in remarks published Monday.
	   The minister, Adel al-Subeih, told the Al-Rai Al-Amm daily that
the country has taken ``full precautions'' to protect its citizens
from the disease.
	   Al-Subeih did not provide further details, but another senior
ministry official, Abdul-Aziz al-Enezi, told Al-Watan newspaper
that the 60 people included women and children.
	   Neither official gave a breakdown of the numbers or said how
many of those infected with acquired immune deficiency syndrome had
died.
	   A test for the AIDS virus is mandatory for all foreigners who
seek residency permits in this oil-rich state. People who test
positive are denied visas and deported.
	   Kuwaitis number about 800,000 of the country's 2.2 million
population.

	   The NLD said it would convene the assembly sometime in
September, leading political analysts in Myanmar to predict that a
government crackdown was imminent.
	   Past attempts by the NLD to hold meetings of its members have
been met with mass arrests by the government.
	   The military government has yet to confirm or comment on the
most recent spate of arrests.
	   The junta's top generals, however, have stepped up their verbal
attacks against Suu Kyi and her party. In recent days, they have
accused them of being ``ax-handles,'' or traitors, and ``lackeys of
neocolonialist'' Western powers seeking to subjugate Myanmar.
	   The NLD statement said that between Sunday and 3 p.m. Monday, 50
elected members of Parliament, including three women, had been
arrested.
	   So were eight members of state and division organizing
committees, 25 members of township-level organizing committees, 24
members of the youth wing and three members of the women's wing.
	   The arrests followed the first street protests against military
rule in nearly two years. Last week, as many as 3,000 students
protested to demand the convening of Parliament and greater
democracy.

Negotiators seek to arrange talks with Congo, rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ African leaders gathered to seek
an end to civil war in Congo worked Monday to find a method to get
both sides talking about peace.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila has refused to meet face-to-face
with rebels who now control a quarter of his vast mineral-rich
central African country.
	   The rebels, who were not included at two previous summits over
the past month, were to arrive later Monday for the talks with
Kabila, and the presidents of Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Uganda and
Rwanda.
	   Angola, Zimbabwe, and Namibia have sent troops to Congo to
support Kabila. Uganda and Rwanda back the rebels.
	   Officials huddled in numerous meetings Monday morning seeking to
devise a method that would allow all the warring factions to
discuss terms of a cease-fire, the withdrawal of all foreign troops
and the establishment of a southern African peacekeeping force.
	   ``This summit will bring a solution to the conflict,'' a
confident Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos said when he
arrived at the summit site Monday morning.
	   It appeared Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, the neutral
chairman of the summit called by President Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe, might have to shuttle between the two sides in an effort
to forge an agreement.
	   Zimbabwean officials said the rebel delegation will be led by
Arthur Zahaidi Ngoma and will include former Congolese Foreign
Minister Bizima Karaha.
	   Salim Ahmed Salim, the secretary-general of the Organization of
African Unity, said the aim of the talks was to reach a cease-fire
agreement that would insure the continuation of Kabila's government
but also bring about democratic reforms.
	   Kabila has been trying to suppress a rebel insurrection since
late July. When the rebels were marching on Kinshasa, the capital,
troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia intervened on behalf of
Kabila.
	   Kabila contends the rebels are sponsored by Rwanda and Uganda, a
charge the two countries deny, and has said he will not agree to a
cease-fire until all Rwandan and Ugandan troops withdraw from
Congo.
	   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said a crucial part of the
discussion would be democratic reform in Congo. Hopes for free
elections rose when Kabila last year overthrew dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko, ending three decades of tyrannical rule.
	   Kabila has promised free elections, but he also has arrested
opposition activists and stirred up ethnic enmities.
	   In behind-the-scene discussions at last week's Nonaligned
Movement summit in Durban, South Africa, regional leaders
reportedly agreed in principle to withdraw troops to the border
regions, where they can monitor security, according to media
reports in South Africa.
	   Rwanda, Uganda and Angola claim that Congo harbors opponents to
their respective governments, and stationing their troops at the
borders would help keep such forces out, The Sunday Times of
Johannesburg reported.
	   Negotiators at the summit also intend to discuss creating a
southern African peacekeeping force to monitor any cease-fire
agreement.
	   Officials say Kabila, as part of any agreement for a cease-fire,
also demands that the summit devise a method of registering rebels
and ways of ascertaining their nationality to make sure they are
Congolese.

Opposition plans to create wide coalition after elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREA LORINCZOVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The leader of Slovakia's largest
opposition party predicted Monday he would win enough support in
this month's national elections to unseat Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar.
	   Slovak voters go to the polls Sept. 25-26 to choose a new,
150-seat parliament, which in turn names the prime minister and his
government.
	   Mikulas Dzurinda, head of the Slovak Democratic Coalition, said
he expects his party to capture 25-27 percent of the vote, which he
said would be enough to form a coalition with others opposed to
Meciar.
	   ``We will create a broad coalition with all of the opposition
parties,'' Dzurinda said. ``Then, we will have a constitutional
majority so that the parliament can function.''
	   The main contenders in the election are Meciar's Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia, the Slovak Democratic Coalition and the Party
of Civic Understanding.
	   A survey by the independent public opinion agency Nazory agency
shows the Slovak Democratic Coalition, formed last March from five
opposition groups, leading with 24.1 percent of the vote. The
agency did not say how many people were surveyed nor give a margin
of error.
	   Despite the survey numbers, Meciar's followers remain confident.
``We are used to the fact that the election polls underestimate our
movement,'' said Sergej Kozlik, vice chairman of Meciar's party.
``In these elections, we expect to gain 40 percent support.''
	   The small opposition parties agreed to unite because a new
election law barred any party from gaining seats in parliament
unless it had receives at least 5 percent of the vote.
	   It was considered highly unlikely that any of the five parties _
the Christian Democratic Movement, the Democratic Union, the
Democratic Party, the Green Party of Slovakia and the Slovak Social
Democratic Party _ could have passed the 5 percent threshold.
	   Despite Dzurinda's apparent optimism, outmaneuvering Meciar and
forming a coalition in such a disparate political culture will be
challenging. Even if the Slovak Democratic Coalition managed to win
about a quarter of the seats, it would have to strike deals with
opposition groups which have widely differing views.
	   For example, the opposition Party of the Hungarian Coalition
focuses primarily on issues of the Hungarian minority, which are
often opposed by mainstream Slovaks.
	   The former Communists, now the Party of the Democratic Left,
opposes many of Dzurinda's economic proposals.
	   Some groups within the former Communists have said they would
not rule out cooperation with Meciar despite their alliance with
Dzurinda. The Party of Civic Understanding, the newest Slovak
party, remains outside the Dzurinda coalition.
	   The Slovak National Party remains part of the government and has
two ministries _ education and defense. But the party is
campaigning independently from Meciar's Movement in the election.
	   But National Party leaders have indicated they might agree to
join forces with Meciar again after the election.
	   But Dzurinda seems unphased.
	   ``Slovakia needs a government of a broad coalition,'' he said.
``One thing that will surely hold us together is the memory of the
past four years, and how the government functioned under Prime
Minister Vladimir Meciar.''

Eights tournament canceled, now set for 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ The Western Australian Cricket
Association has canceled the inaugural World Super 8s tournament
that it said would have featured Indian batting star Sachin
Tendulkar.
	   The three-day tournament was to have been held at the WACA
Ground in mid-October. But the association said Monday that the
tournament, which had offered prize money of over 500,000
Australian dollars (295,000 U.S. dlrs) would instead be held in
1999.
	   WACA officials said the late cancellation was due to problems
attracting the best players from many of the nations, with a number
of countries having other international commitments at the same
time.
	   Australia itself would have fielded a second string lineup, with
the test squad touring Pakistan next month.
	   The tournament had been in doubt in recent months due to an
inability to secure a major sponsor, but WACA chief executive Mike
Allenby said the quality of players available had been the reason
for the decision, which was made in conjunction with the Australian
Cricket Board.
	   Allenby said the future of the abbreviated form of cricket
depended on the first tournament being a success.
	   ``In the interests of cricket lovers and cricket players, it was
felt it would be better to reschedule the Perth tournament until
1999 to ensure the highest quality tournament,'' he said. (djp)

Myanmar military arrests 110 members of Suu Kyi's party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government has
arrested 110 members of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's
political party, the party said Monday.
	   The National League for Democracy said 50 elected members of
Parliament were among those detained in a wave of arrests that
began Sunday.
	   The arrests so far were taking place mainly in provinces outside
of the capital, Yangon, and have included officials of the party's
organizing committees, and members of its youth and women's wings.
	   The crackdown had been anticipated after the NLD announced last
month it would convene the Parliament elected in 1990.
	   The arrests also followed the first street protests against
military rule in nearly two years. Last week, as many as 3,000
students protested to demand the convening of Parliament and
greater democracy.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats in that Parliament. Despite
promising before the polls that it would hand over power to the
victors, the military refused to honor the result.
	   Suu Kyi, who won the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize while under house
arrest from 1989-95, has been stepping up her campaign to bring
democracy to Myanmar.
	   The Southeast Asian country, also known as Burma, has been ruled
by the military in various guises since 1962.
	   Suu Kyi and the NLD set a deadline of Aug. 21 for the military
to convene the 1990 Parliament. When the deadline passed with no
action from the government, the party announced it would convene
Parliament on its own.
	   The military has warned that would be illegal and would result
in the arrests of NLD members and possibly revoking of the party's
legal status.
	   The NLD said it would convene the assembly sometime in
September, leading political analysts in Myanmar to predict that a
government crackdown was imminent.
	   Past attempts by the NLD to hold meetings of its members have
been met with mass arrests by the government.
	   The military government has yet to confirm or comment on the
most recent spate of arrests.

Court ruling on election fraud helps Thai government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's
government received some political breathing space Monday as a
court rejected an election fraud complaint against three
legislators from the ruling coalition.
	   The ruling helps preserve Chuan's small majority in Parliament
for the time being, but he remains under pressure from a scandal
over procurement for state-run hospitals and another pending legal
challenge.
	   There has been intense speculation for weeks that Chuan will
reshuffle his Cabinet, perhaps bringing in another party, to shore
up his coalition's strength.
	   The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a complaint alleging
election fraud in 1996 by Deputy Interior Minister Vatana Asavahame
and two other members of Parliament from the Prachakorn Thai Party.
	   Vatana led a defection of 12 lawmakers from Prachakorn Thai to
support Chuan's government when it was formed last year.
	   But party leader Samak Sundaravej is attempting to expel the 12
from his party, which would automatically deprive them of their
house seats.
	   Samak's effort is expected to ultimately succeed, which would
whittle down the government's current 15-seat majority to an
unstable razor-thin level.
	   Meanwhile, a coalition of 27 private organizations called Sunday
for the resignations of Health Minister Rakkiat Sukthana, one
deputy minister from Rakkiat's Social Action Party, one from
Chuan's Democrat Party, and two senior civil servants at the
ministry.
	   The Social Action Party has 20 legislators in the governing
coalition.
	   The organizations will give Chuan a week to reply after they
present their demands to him Tuesday, newspaper reports said
Monday. If he fails to respond, they will begin gathering the
50,000 signatures needed under the new constitution to put the
matter before the Senate.
	   The scandal involves a 1.4 billion baht (dlrs 34.1 million) fund
distributed to the hospitals that was used to purchase drugs and
medical goods from selected suppliers at inflated prices.
	   Details of the scandal came from activist doctors and two senior
health ministry officials. It is rare for officials to speak out
publicly on such scandals.
	   The private organizations said the three Cabinet members and
senior health ministry officials should resign to take
responsibility for the matter and clear the way for further
independent investigation, regardless of whether they are
eventually found to have been involved in the scandal.
	   They also want Chuan to directly oversee the investigation into
the scandal. He had tried to distance himself from the case when it
was first revealed, but has spoken out increasingly after coming
under criticism.
	   Chuan has urged doctors to come forward with any information
related to the allegations, and promised them protection from
retaliation by ministry officials.
	   The newspaper Bangkok Post reported Saturday that Interior
Minister Sanan Kachornprasart, secretary-general of Chuan's party,
was pushing to have the 51-legislator Chart Pattana Party join the
ruling coalition to help the government last through its full term
to 2000.

Manchester United shares soar as Murdoch seeks control

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Manchester United share prices soared in early
trading Monday ahead of an expected bid for the soccer giant by
Rupert Murdoch's satellite television company BSkyB.
	   Two British national newspapers owned by Murdoch, The Times and
the tabloid Sun, said he would make a formal offer by midweek to
clinch a deal that critics see as potentially giving BSkyB a
stranglehold on TV and marketing rights to Premier League soccer.
	   If approved, it would be the first takeover of a British soccer
club by a media group. In Italy, media magnate Silvio Berlusconi
controls AC Milan, and the French pay-TV channel Canal Plus owns
Paris St. Germain.
	   Murdoch's Fox Television network spent some dlrs 360 million
earlier this year on buying baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers.
	   Despite signals from Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor
government that a Murdoch takeover would be subject to a fair
trading inquiry, the Manchester United share price surged to 217.5
pence (361 cents), up from 159 pence (264 cents) late Friday.
	   BSkyB and Manchester United each formally confirmed the takeover
talks. The Times said Monday some Manchester United directors were
arguing that the bid price was too low.
	   The Financial Times reported Monday that leisure group Enic,
which has extensive interests in European soccer, was poised to
make a rival bid, encouraged by political concerns over a deal with
Murdoch.
	   Enic, whose stakes include Glasgow Rangers, Slavia Prague, AEK
Athens and Vicenza, has not yet held talks with United but plans to
approach the club this week, the newspaper said. The group would
look to U.S. entertainment giant Time Warner for financial backing,
the newspaper added.
	   On Sunday, Sports Minister Tony Banks said a deal with Murdoch
could be subject to an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading
because of its profound implications.
	   ``... This is not something that can just be treated as if it
were just a normal takeover of one publicly quoted company by
another,'' Banks said.
	   Football Association chairman Keith Wiseman took a distant
attitude, saying ``many large companies are involved in football
already.''
	   ``I very much doubt whether the FA will have a view on the
transaction itself,'' Wiseman said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
radio interview Monday.
	   The Murdoch newspapers reported the possibility of the deal in
favorable terms _ and others were largely hostile.
	   Murdoch, said The Independent, a London daily, has ``moved from
owning the television rights to sport to controlling the sport
itself.''
	   ``Anger at `unfair' Sky deal,'' declared The Guardian newspaper.
	   Through Sky TV, Murdoch has made sweeping changes to coverage of
soccer in Britain.
	   Few games are shown live on regular terrestrial stations. Sky
also has exclusive rights to cover England's games such as last
Saturday's European Championship qualifying round loss to Sweden.
	   The Times said talks between BSkyB chief executive Mark Booth
and Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards have been going on
for five months and that the television company would pay 225 pence
a share.
	   The club was floated on the stock market in 1991.

 &UR; Russian ruble crashes, Central Bank chief submits resignation &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with new details, quotes; trims &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The ruble collapsed dramatically and Central Bank
Chairman Sergei Dubinin offered to resign as economic turmoil and
political instability rocked Russia again on Monday.
	   Trading in U.S. dollars was canceled on the Moscow interbank
currency exchange because people only wanted to buy dollars, not
sell them. However, deals which are to take effect Tuesday pegged
the exchange rate at as much as 30 rubles to the dollar.
	   That's down from an official rate that was 17 rubles to the
dollar on Friday and 20.66 on Monday. The ruble was trading at just
over six to the dollar when the crisis hit last month.
	   ``Everyone is waiting for the confirmation of the prime minister
and the announcement of a new economic program,'' said acting
deputy premier Boris Fyodorov. ``If there are no offers, the
(ruble) price can be anything.''
	   The ruble's continued crash indicated the market had little
faith in an immediate resolution to the political standoff between
President Boris Yeltsin and his rivals in parliament.
	   The State Duma, parliament's lower house, was to hold a second
vote Monday on Yeltsin's candidate for prime minister, Viktor
Chernomyrdin. The Communists and their allies who control the Duma
rejected Chernomyrdin last week and have vowed to oppose him again.
	   The market also reacted to the news that Dubinin has offered his
resignation. Dubinin blamed parliament for failing to adopt
anti-crisis measures.
	   ``There is no government and no chairman at the Central Bank,''
said Roman Serov, trader at Moscow's ABN-Amro Bank. ``I can't see
anything good resulting from this.''
	   Chernomyrdin, who said he wants the Central Bank to print more
money to help pay off overdue wages and pensions, criticized
Dubinin over the weekend. Dubinin has favored a tough monetary
policy.
	   Russia's battered economy has been in a free fall since
mid-August, with the ruble collapsing, prices soaring and the
government effectively defaulting on foreign loans.
	   Many Russians who receive their salaries in rubles have been
buying extra supplies of essential goods because they believe
prices will continue to rise.
	   In the eastern port city of Vladivostok, prices for meat, sugar,
macaroni and baby food have roughly doubled in recent days.
	   The interim government has been powerless to stop the whirlwind.
Over the weekend, Chernomyrdin sought to reassure Western
governments and Russians that there would be no retreat to a
Soviet-style economic system.
	   In a message to European financial ministers Sunday, he promised
that ``with the help of the international community, we will manage
to stabilize the situation.''
	   Yeltsin, speaking at an international parliamentary assembly in
Moscow Monday, blamed overall instability at the world financial
markets.
	   ``In Russia, it has been caused by both internal and external
factors, but I'm sure we will be able to correct the situation,''
he said.

King Hussein's illness raises questions about Jordan's future
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY200, NY201. &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Not only did King Hussein spend his 46th
anniversary as Jordan's monarch being treated for cancer in an
American hospital. Worse, gossip back home about his illness became
so frenzied that he had to deny rumors about who would succeed him.
	   The king's illness has set off deep worries about the future in
this small Middle Eastern country ruled by Hussein's family since
its founding in the 1920s as Transjordan.
	   ``This issue is as popular with Jordanians as the Lewinsky
affair with the Americans,'' legislator Mohammed Oueidi Abbadi
says.
	   Concern isn't limited to Jordan. The pro-American Hussein has
been a moderating influence in the region, and any instability in
Jordan would be a potential snag to peace efforts.
	   The king's hospitalization at the Mayo Clinic since July, his
second bout with cancer in six years, has brought talk of him
possibly stepping down.
	   Hussein named his brother Hassan as successor in 1965, but
rumors have spread of a change of mind. There also are rumors of
dissension over the issue in the royal family and of the
American-born Queen Noor maneuvering for her eldest son to be
chosen king.
	   Many people have long expressed worries that 51-year-old Crown
Prince Hassan, who is far less charismatic than his older brother,
would have a hard time steering Jordan through the minefield of
Middle East politics.
	   Hussein, who has survived wars and assassination attempts, is
known for his military bearing. By contrast, Hassan is an Oxford
graduate with more the demeanor of a scholar. He has emerged from
his brother's shadow by taking on more royal duties in recent
years, but is still a remote figure to many Jordanians.
	   The succession speculation comes at a shaky time, with Jordan
possibly facing a change in its character from a proposed
confederation with the Palestinian entity that might emerge from
Mideast peace talks. More than half Jordan's 3.8 million people
already are Palestinian, so such a confederation would reduce the
Bedouin tribes loyal to the king to a small minority.
	   With rumors flying, King Hussein sought in mid-August to quiet
speculation about a succession battle in an interview from his room
in the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
	   ``The heir to the throne is my brother, whom I have chosen over
many others in the past years, and he has proved to be up to the
responsibility,'' Hussein told Radio Monte Carlo, a popular Arabic
station.
	   Still, gossip has persisted about other potential successors,
among them Hussein's five sons from his four marriages and Prince
Rashid, 19, son of Hassan and Pakistani-born Princess Savarth.
	   Sources close to the royal family and Western diplomats say
Queen Noor is ruffling family feathers by grooming their
18-year-old son, Prince Hamzah, to take the throne, possibly
without Hassan ever serving as king.
	   The queen, American-born Lisa Halaby, who converted to Islam
upon her marriage in 1978, denies there is dissension within the
family.
	   ``I am committed to supporting who is best qualified to rule
Jordan,'' Noor said on CNN. Hussein has a vision of the future
ruler, she said, and ``I trust my husband's instincts.''
	   But the speculation about Prince Hamzah has been fed by his
father, too. The king has taken Hamzah along on state visits, and
he sent an emotional public letter to the prince on his 18th
birthday in March, recalling how tough it was when, at age 17,
Hussein himself took the throne.
	   When Hussein revealed his illness on state television in July,
he assured the public he was not yet ready to step down. Public
figures also have said they doubt Hussein would take such a step.
	   But fears over the future persist in a country where most
citizens have known no ruler but Hussein.
	   ``He is a father of all Jordanians,'' architect Majd Safi said,
sitting with friends at an Amman coffee house. ``Our country will
never be the same without him.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Manchester United share prices soared in early
trading Monday ahead of an expected bid for the soccer giant by
Rupert Murdoch's satellite television company BSkyB.
	   Two British national newspapers owned by Murdoch, The Times and
the tabloid Sun, said he would make a formal offer by midweek to
clinch a deal that critics see as potentially giving BSkyB a
stranglehold on TV and marketing rights to Premier League soccer.
	   If approved, it would be the first takeover of a British soccer
club by a media group. In Italy, media magnate Silvio Berlusconi
controls AC Milan, and the French pay-TV channel Canal Plus owns
Paris St. Germain.
	   Murdoch's Fox Television network spent some dlrs 360 million
earlier this year on buying baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers.
	   Despite signals from Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor
government that a Murdoch takeover would be subject to a fair
trading inquiry, the Manchester United share price surged to 217.5
pence (361 cents), up from 159 pence (264 cents) late Friday.
	   BSkyB and Manchester United each formally confirmed the takeover
talks. The Times said Monday some Manchester United directors were
arguing that the bid price was too low.
	   The Financial Times reported Monday that leisure group Enic,
which has extensive interests in European soccer, was poised to
make a rival bid, encouraged by political concerns over a deal with
Murdoch.
	   Enic, whose stakes include Glasgow Rangers, Slavia Prague, AEK
Athens and Vicenza, has not yet held talks with United but plans to
approach the club this week, the newspaper said. The group would
look to U.S. entertainment giant Time Warner for financial backing,
the newspaper added.
	   On Sunday, Sports Minister Tony Banks said a deal with Murdoch
could be subject to an investigation by the Office of Fair Trading
because of its profound implications.
	   ``... This is not something that can just be treated as if it
were just a normal takeover of one publicly quoted company by
another,'' Banks said.
	   Football Association chairman Keith Wiseman took a distant
attitude, saying ``many large companies are involved in football
already.''
	   ``I very much doubt whether the FA will have a view on the
transaction itself,'' Wiseman said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
radio interview Monday.
	   The Murdoch newspapers reported the possibility of the deal in
favorable terms _ and others were largely hostile.
	   Murdoch, said The Independent, a London daily, has ``moved from
owning the television rights to sport to controlling the sport
itself.''
	   ``Anger at `unfair' Sky deal,'' declared The Guardian newspaper.
	   Through Sky TV, Murdoch has made sweeping changes to coverage of
soccer in Britain.
	   Few games are shown live on regular terrestrial stations. Sky
also has exclusive rights to cover England's games such as last
Saturday's European Championship qualifying round loss to Sweden.
	   The Times said talks between BSkyB chief executive Mark Booth
and Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards have been going on
for five months and that the television company would pay 225 pence
a share.
	   The club was floated on the stock market in 1991.

Israel, Palestinians diverge on progress in withdrawal talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of a new U.S. Mideast peace mission,
Israel and the Palestinians diverged widely Monday on how much
progress has been made in talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said a deal was
``very close,'' while Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said the
gaps between the two sides ``still remain wide.''
	   With their contradictory assessments, each side apparently hoped
to invite maximum U.S. pressure on the other side.
	   The U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, is to arrive in the region
on Wednesday in an attempt to clinch a deal. Ross is to meet with
Arafat on Wednesday and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
on Thursday.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal that Israel withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank and the Palestinians commit to a detailed
blueprint for fighting Islamic militants under close U.S.
supervision.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. proposal.
	   Israel, after first rejecting the scope of withdrawal, said it
would hand over 13 percent, on condition that 3 percent of that
area be declared a nature reserve in which Palestinian land use is
restricted.
	   Israeli officials have said the two sides agreed on the scope of
the withdrawal and that the key sticking point was a Palestinian
refusal to commit to security measures as part of a crackdown on
Islamic militants.
	   ``We think we are very close to achieve agreement with the
Palestinians,'' Mordechai told reporters Monday in his halting
English. ``It needs that the Palestinians will be flexible ...to
fight against terror. The gap, I think is very close.''
	   However, the Palestinians have said the withdrawal issue was
still on the table and that they have not agreed to the
restrictions on land use proposed by the Israelis.
	   Arafat said Monday that the Israelis have yet to respond to
various other elements of the U.S. plan.
	   ``Netanyahu is trying to bypass the (U.S.) initiative and he is
trying to divide it and he does not want to make a total commitment
to it,'' Arafat said.
	   Arafat denied Israeli media reports that a draft agreement on
most issues has been reached. ``No understanding has been reached
and the gaps still remain wide,'' he said.

Legislators urge Museveni to insist troops remain in Congo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Legislators urged President Yoweri
Museveni to insist during a regional summit Monday that Ugandan
troops remain in embattled Congo to fight Ugandan rebels based
there, a newspaper said Monday.
	   Museveni was participating in the summit at Victoria Falls,
Zimbabwe, to discuss the withdrawal for foreign troops from the
vast central African country where fighting surged six weeks ago.
	   Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have sent troops to assist
Congolese President Laurent Kabila's army put down a rebellion
Kabila claims is spearheaded by Rwanda and Uganda. While Rwanda and
Uganda insist on the right to fight their own rebels operating in
eastern Congo, both countries have denied their armies are
assisting Congolese rebels trying to oust Kabila.
	   The government-owned New Vision newspaper said that during a
meeting Sunday more than 50 legislators of Museveni's National
Resistance Movement told the president to insist that Ugandan
troops stay in eastern Congo to fight the Ugandan rebel Allied
Democratic Front.
	   ``We have told the president in no uncertain terms to be very,
very firm in all the meetings he goes to, unless Congo eliminates
the ADF and other rebel groups from its territory,'' the newspaper
quoted caucus chairman Gilbert Bukenya as saying.
	   ``We told (Museveni) that he must pursue the rebels into Congo
because we have no other choice when they cross from there to
abduct our people.''
	   The ADF has used bases in eastern Congo to launch attacks across
the border into western Uganda, often killing or kidnapping
civilians. Ugandan troops are fighting ADF rebels in the Rwenzori
mountains which straddle Uganda's western border with Congo.
	   The government maintains that all of its troops in Congo are
there under a joint defense agreement made with Kabila before
relations turned sour.
	   The New Vision said Kabila told legislators Sunday that Ugandan
troops were 20 kilometers (13 miles) inside Congolese territory.
	   Last week, opposition legislator Kawanga Ssemogerere of the
Democratic Party, sided with the Congolese government in accusing
Museveni of deploying troops inside Congo to help the war against
Kabila.
	   Meanwhile, the newspaper reported Monday that the army killed 35
ADF rebels on both sides of the border in the Rwenzori mountains
last week during an ambush.

Despite best efforts of language cops, English keeps creeping in
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ When a French teen-ager talks about getting drunk,
he might well use the verb ``se destroyer.'' Publicists with no
time for lunch are ``overbooke.''
	   Whether in the street or on the Internet, English continues to
invade the language of Moliere, despite valiant attempts by
France's official language mavens to keep it pure.
	   The French government has passed a slew of laws since 1975
banning foreign words from advertising, official documents,
scientific meetings and publications, radio and television.
	   But they're powerless to stem the flow of English into the
vernacular, diluting what the French call ``La Belle Langue'' _ the
beautiful language.
	   Enforcement of the language pollution laws is lax, fines are
minimal, and English is undeniably in.
	   Rappers weave exhortations like ``Burn the place'' into their
songs. Fast-food joints on the Champs-Elysees serve up sandwiches
with names like ``le Big Western.'' The C-and-A department store
chain is pitching back-to-school clothes emblazoned with ``Once
upon a snowy afternoon.''
	   The Academie Francaise _ the elite body established more than
three centuries ago to maintain French language supremacy _ has
lobbied for years to keep linguistic imports out of common usage.
	   But even while ``le cash-flow,'' ``le deal'' and ``le
marketing'' were banned from the latest edition of the Academie's
official dictionary, ``le dead-heat'' and ``le boom'' slipped in.
	   Often, it's because there's an English word where there's no
French one.
	   Cardinal Richelieu, Louis XIII's influential finance minister,
founded the Academie in 1635 not only to ``clean out the garbage
from the mouths of common folk'' but also to rein in the nation's
elite thinkers.
	   Time has shown that the fluid nature of language defies
regulation. As the 19th century novelist Victor Hugo put it: ``The
word is a living thing.''
	   France's current Socialist government says its language laws
aren't designed to keep French pure, but rather to ``make sure it
does not disappear from the international world of business,
economics and science.''
	   Language cops say the laws also protect consumers, forcing
manufacturers to provide health and safety information and
instruction manuals in French.
	   According to the General Delegation on the French Language, more
than 15,000 companies have been spot-checked for compliance since
1994. The biggest offenders _ in packaged foods, cosmetics, stereos
and computers _ received fines ranging from 900 to 6,000 francs
(dlrs 150 to 1,000).
	   While a 1994 Culture Ministry poll found the vast majority of
French favored linguistic protectionism, the public demand for
English has never been greater.
	   Last year, three times as many public school children learned
English as studied the language of Europe's economic powerhouse
next door _ German.
	   Parents gathered recently at a Paris child care center bemoaned
the absence of English in the pre-school curriculum.
	   One disgruntled father said he'd even gone to the mayor and
school board to no avail. That may soon change.
	   Education Minister Claude Allegre recently called English ``a
communications tool as indispensable as the telephone and the
computer,'' and he hired 800 additional English speakers to teach
fifth-graders this fall.
	   Elisabeth Zeboulon, director of the Bilingual School in Paris,
says applications to her elite establishment have skyrocketed,
especially from French families.
	   ``This year beat all the records,'' she said. ``Parents are
realizing that good English is essential as a work tool and for
accessing information via the Internet.''
	   She said the Bilingual School's primary classes, which once
catered to the children of foreign businessmen, diplomats and
visiting scholars, are now three-quarters French.
	   ``Being bilingual gives children a leg up in life, regardless of
what career they choose,'' said Patrick Gurfinkiel, a French
accountant whose three daughters attend the school.
	   On the Internet, French-language Web sites pale in comparison to
what's available in English.
	   And while a government Web site invites users to join
France-Langue-Digest, an on-line chat group aimed at protecting the
French language, it apologizes for the group's name: There's no
French equivalent for ``digest.''

Karadzic posters appear in Pale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Posters of Bosnia's leading war
crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic appeared Monday in a Bosnian Serb
stronghold outside Sarajevo in a violation of election rules ahead
of this week's national election.
	   The posters surfaced a day after an election rally in Pale by
the Serb Democratic Party, the nationalist party which Karadzic
headed until forced to withdraw from political life after he was
indicted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
	   Karadzic led Bosnian Serbs into the 1992 rebellion against the
Muslim-led Bosnian government and headed the breakaway Bosnian Serb
entity throughout most of the 3 1/2 year war.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the
international group in charge of Bosnia's elections, has banned any
mention of or appearance by those indicted for war crimes before
the two-day vote Saturday and Sunday.
	   It was not clear who plastered Pale with Karadzic pictures. The
Karadzic party, known by its Serbian initials SDS, enjoys support
in Pale, which was the Bosnian Serb wartime headquarters,
	   Several thousand people attended a rally Sunday evening.
	   Sources in Pale close to the SDS leadership claimed the party
had nothing to do with the appearance of the posters and blamed the
political opponents.
	   Pale is the stronghold of Karadzic and the supporters of his
nationalist policies. Karadzic is believed to be hiding somewhere
in the Bosnian Serb half of Bosnia avoiding arrest by NATO-led
peace troops.

Probe into Hong Kong airport chaos begins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A top aviation official told independent
investigators Monday that airport officials were aware before Hong
Kong's new airport opened in July that computer problems could give
it a black eye.
	   But Richard Siegel, director of civil aviation, said the
government had not rushed officials to open the U.S. dlrs 20
billion airport on any specific date, media reports added.
	   Siegel was the first official to testify in a 12-week
investigation ordered by Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa in late
July.
	   A two-member team, headed by respected Justice Woo Kwok-hing,
has been assigned to find out why the much-anticipated airport
opening in early July turned into a costly embarrassment, and who
is responsible.
	   The investigators have received 200 cartons of documents related
to the fiasco, the government reported.
	   Several senior officials have been summoned to testify,
including the airport authority's chief executive, Hank Townsend,
and the managing director of the main cargo handler, Anthony
Charter.
	   In the new airport's first few days of operation, dozens of
planes were delayed for hours, thousands of frustrated passengers
were stranded at the remote passenger terminal, and thousands of
bags were misplaced.
	   Flight information displays were blank, water and electricity
supplies in retail shops were unreliable, and public toilets were
blocked.
	   Software and mechanical problems plaguing the cargo terminal
were so severe that the main handler, Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals, slapped a partial ban on air cargo transport a day after
the airport opened, and eventually moved parts of the operation
back to the old Kai Tak airport.
	   Officials estimated the cargo problems could cost Hong Kong 0.35
percent of this year's gross domestic product, which is expected to
contract by 4 percent. The territory's flag carrier, Cathay
Pacific, also blamed the cargo problems for its first-ever loss,
recorded in the first seven months of 1988.
	   Critics suspect government officials may have pressured the
airport authority for an early July opening to coincide with a
visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who dedicated the airport.
	   Others accused officials of arrogance and incompetence.
	   Siegel told the investigators he had warned other officials 16
months before the opening that computer glitches could plague the
complex flight information display system, and raised concerns over
insufficient training for airport workers, the government-run Radio
Hong Kong reported.
	   But he said the airport met all safety requirements before his
department issued it the required license.
	   The new Chek Lap Kok airport was built on reclaimed land off a
remote outlying island, replacing the 73-year-old Kai Tak airport.
	   Passenger and cargo services have returned to normal. A survey
commissioned by the airport authority and released Sunday said most
respondents considered services at the new airport better than at
Kai Tak.
	   In the survey by Lingnan College, 86 percent of more than 4,000
respondents said services at the passenger terminal were
satisfactory.
	   On a scale of one to 10, services at Chek Lap Kok were rated
7.5, slightly above the 6.8 given to Kai Tak in 1997.

Miner dies in accident in eastern Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - A miner conducting repair works fell 25
meters (82.5 feet) to his death in a vertical shaft at a mine in
eastern Ukraine, officials said Monday.
	   The accident occurred at the Kondrativka mine in Ukraine's
coal-producing region of Donetsk, the Emergency Situations Ministry
reported without giving further details.
	   About 265 miners already have died this year in Ukraine's
deteriorating coal mines, and 290 workers were killed in accidents
last year.
	   The number of miners killed on the job has been steadily
increasing in recent years because mines lack the funds needed to
modernize equipment and improve safety conditions.
	   The worst single accident this year occurred in April, when a
methane gas blast killed 63 workers at a mine in the Donetsk
region.

Boy blinded in U.S. Embassy bombing going home after surgery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A 15-year-old Kenyan schoolboy blinded in the
Nairobi U.S. Embassy bombing will return home Monday after surgery,
but not yet knowing whether he will see again.
	   Moorfields Eye Hospital in London said it was not yet possible
to determine how much vision Stanley Mutuma would regain. He will
remain under observation by the Kikuyu Eye Unit in Nairobi for
several months while he recovers from the two operations.
	   The teen-ager, who was in a school bus when the bomb went off
Aug. 7, was blinded by shards of glass.
	   The Aug. 7 explosion killed 247 people and injured more than
5,400.
	   Twenty people were blinded outright and up to 50 others will
probably be left with vision so badly impaired they can only
perceive light and motion, Nairobi hospital officials have said.
	   Hundreds of others have varying degrees of impaired vision, and
many of them will need follow-up treatment to prevent their sight
from deteriorating further.

Latest violence: bomb on rail tracks, armed clash in capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A bomb placed under train tracks south
of Algiers exploded, killing up to five people, newspapers and
hospital sources said Monday.
	   The bombing Sunday was one of two known incidents of weekend
violence around the capital.
	   Inside Algiers, police and suspected Islamic militants clashed
Sunday at the Place des Martyrs, a main square near the port and
the ancient Casbah. Witnesses said at least two of the militants
were killed and one policeman wounded.
	   Neither incident was officially acknowledged by security forces,
who provide only sporadic reports of the violence plaguing this
North African nation since 1992, when the army canceled legislative
elections to thwart a likely victory by Muslim fundamentalists. The
move triggered an Islamic insurgency.
	   Hospital sources reported that two people were killed and five
injured in the Sunday train bombing on the line linking Algiers to
Blida, about 50 kms (30 miles) to the south, and train cars
damaged.
	   Newspapers, citing witnesses, reported that up to five people
were killed.
	   The summer brought a resurgence of attacks to the Algiers area.
Much of the recent violence has been concentrated around Tlemcen,
near the Moroccan border to the west.
	   An estimated 75,000 people _ civilians, insurgents and security
forces _ have been killed since the start of the insurgency.

Israel, Palestinians diverge on progress in withdrawal talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of a new U.S. Mideast peace mission,
Israel and the Palestinians diverged widely Monday on how much
progress has been made in talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said a deal was
``very close,'' while Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said the
gaps between the two sides ``still remain wide.''
	   With their contradictory assessments, each side apparently hoped
to invite maximum U.S. pressure on the other side.
	   The U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, is scheduled to arrive in
the region on Wednesday in an attempt to clinch a deal. Ross is to
meet with Arafat on Wednesday and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu on Thursday.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal that Israel withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank and the Palestinians commit to a detailed
blueprint for fighting Islamic militants under close U.S.
supervision.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. proposal.
	   Israel, after first rejecting the scope of withdrawal, said it
would hand over 13 percent, on condition that 3 percent of that
area be declared a nature reserve in which Palestinian land use is
restricted.
	   Israeli officials have said the two sides agreed on the scope of
the withdrawal and that the key sticking point was a Palestinian
refusal to commit to security measures as part of a crackdown on
Islamic militants.
	   ``We think we are very close to achieve agreement with the
Palestinians,'' Mordechai told reporters Monday in halting English.
``It needs that the Palestinians will be flexible ...to fight
against terror. The gap, I think is very close.''
	   However, the Palestinians have said the withdrawal issue was
still undecided and that they have not agreed to the restrictions
on land use proposed by the Israelis.
	   Arafat said Monday that the Israelis have yet to respond to
various other elements of the U.S. plan.
	   ``Netanyahu is trying to bypass the (U.S.) initiative and he is
trying to divide it and he does not want to make a total commitment
to it,'' Arafat said.
	   Arafat denied Israeli media reports that a draft agreement on
most issues has been reached. ``No understanding has been reached
and the gaps still remain wide,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Firefighters have put out a blaze that raged for
five days on a fish processing ship in the Russian Far East, a news
agency reported Monday.
	   One sailor died as a result of the fire on the Sovetskoye
Zapolarye ship in the seas off the port of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The fire originated in one of the holds of the giant ship. Two
other fish factories came to its rescue, but they were unable to
extinguished the flames quickly.

Lawyer raises concerns about U.S.-British Lockerbie offer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Libyan lawyer for two men accused in the
1988 bombing of a Pan Am passenger jet expressed doubts Monday
whether they can get a fair trial under a U.S.-British proposal.
	   Last month, the United States and Britain said it would accept a
trial before Scottish judges under Scottish law in the Netherlands.
	   Defense attorney Ibrahim Legwell told Egyptian reporters in the
Libyan capital Tripoli that the trial by a tribunal consisting of
just Scottish judges ``raises possibilities of losing neutrality
and of achieving justice, which should be under the eyes of the
world community.''
	   He added: ``A trial like this is merely a process of shifting a
court from a Scottish town to a court in the suburbs of The Hague
in the Netherlands.''
	   Libya in the past has insisted that the two suspects _ Abdel
Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ be tried in a
``neutral'' country. They have suggested an international judicial
panel, headed by a Scottish judge.
	   Legwell's remarks, reported by Egypt's Middle East News Agency,
were the latest from Libya in recent days challenging the terms of
the joint U.S.-British proposal.
	   In a speech Saturday, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi said that if
found guilty, the men should serve their time in Libya. The
Americans and British have said they would be imprisoned in
Britain.
	   Gadhafi also said Libya did not recognize the agreement between
Britain and the Netherlands to stage the trial nor the U.N.
Security Council resolution endorsing it.
	   The resolution says that once the suspects are handed over for
trial, trade sanctions imposed on Libya in 1992 will be lifted.
	   The sanctions were imposed to force Libya to turn over the
suspects in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   In his remarks Monday, Legwell complained that there were no
guarantees in the U.S.-British proposal that the suspects would
have easy access to their lawyers and families.
	   He said the suspects also needed a team of translators, access
to medical care and ``a preacher who helps them practice their
religious duties,'' MENA said.
	   The agency said Legwell expressed concern that extradition
agreements would allow the United States and Britain to demand
transfer of the suspects from the Netherlands before, during or
after a trial.
	   Libya announced last month that it accepted the U.S.-British
offer in principle but called for negotiations to guarantee the
``security and safety'' of the suspects.

Ametistov, prominent Russian judge, dead at 64
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ernest Ametistov, a member of Russia's highest
court who defended democratic freedoms and spearheaded legal
reforms, died Monday, officials said. He was 64.
	   Ametistov, a member of Russia's Constitutional Court, died at
his country home near Moscow, court officials said. Ametistov's
wife Olga said he died of cancer, which he had battled for months.
	   Ametistov was born in Leningrad _ now St. Petersburg _ and had
his father arrested and executed in Soviet dictator Josef Stalin's
purges.
	   In the late 1950s, Ametistov graduated from the Moscow State
University's law faculty and started working as editor for a state
publishing house. In the following years, he joined research
centers dealing with legal studies, specializing in international
law.
	   In the final years before the Soviet collapse, Ametistov joined
the Memorial human rights group, which supported democratic reforms
and publicized details of abuses carried out during the communist
era.
	   Ametistov was elected a judge of Russia's Constitutional Court
in October 1991 and was known for his persistent efforts to
streamline and liberalize the Soviet-era legal system.
	   In the fall of 1993, when most of the court judges sided with
parliament in its rebellion against President Boris Yeltsin,
Ametistov strongly backed Yeltsin.
	   Ametistov is survived by his mother Raisa, his wife and daughter
Olga. His funeral was planned for Wednesday.

	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ The conservative Nationalist party has
claimed an election victory seen as a mandate for Malta's drive to
join the European Union, ousting the Labor party of Premier Alfred
Sant, who had put the EU bid on hold.
	   Miscalculating that he could win early elections, Sant resigned
after conceding defeat Sunday, even as counting of Saturday's
written balloting for parliament continued. Nationalist leader
Eddie Fenech Adami was immediately sworn in.
	   Early Monday, Maltese started to celebrate in the streets. Boys
wore the Nationalist party flag as a cape and girls tied minute
flags around their necks as scarves as they strolled the streets.
	   Scattered traffic jams developed as people drove around in cars
draped with the flags of the winning party and of the European
Union.
	   Fenech Adami claimed victory based on partial results made known
to party officials. There was no immediate indication Monday when
complete results would be announced.

After grenade attack, Hun Sen orders arrests, end to protests

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Accusing the political opposition of
launching a grenade attack against his house Monday, strongman Hun
Sen said his most bitter opponent would be arrested and ordered an
end to weeks of protest against his rule.
	   Police guarding the hotel where that opponent, politician Sam
Rainsy, was meeting diplomats fired warning shots at cars from the
Canadian and Singaporean embassies. No one was hurt and the cars
proceeded without any damage.
	   It was not clear why officers fired the eight to 10 shots in
front of the Cambodiana hotel, but the incident indicated how high
tensions were running.
	   The events set the stage for a possible violent end to the
worsening confrontation between Hun Sen and the opposition leaders,
Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, since disputed
parliamentary elections July 26.
	   Hun Sen, who was not at home during the attack, rejected
speculation at a news conference that he had staged the incident to
crack down on opponents. But he left little doubt he was looking to
reassert his authority.
	   ``The arrests are to start from this hour,'' Hun Sen said. ``How
many people will be arrested is up to prosecutors to decide. We
urge the people who are to be arrested not to resist.''
	   Hun Sen said there was ``already a request'' for the immediate
arrest of Sam Rainy, his most strident opponent and chief leader of
round-the-clock anti-Hun Sen protests entering their third week.
	   Hun Sen branded Sam Rainsy a ``terrorist.''
	   Ranariddh, whom Hun Sen deposed as co-prime minister in a bloody
coup last year, could also be arrested, Hun Sen said.
	   Sam Rainsy's party said it had no information about the grenade
attack.
	   ``The regime is using every pretext it can find to justify the
illegal and anti-democratic actions it seems to be preparing to
take against the peaceful political opposition,'' it said in a
written statement.
	   It added that Sam Rainsy would try to speak at the
anti-government rally that has been going on outside the National
Assembly for the past two weeks.
	   Hun Sen warned embassies against granting the suspects refuge
and said they would not be allowed to leave the country.
	   The protesters were given until midnight to pack up their tents,
mats and cooking gear and clear out from the park opposite the
National Assembly they call ``Democracy Square.''
	   ``We have to return public and social order to the citizens of
Phnom Penh,'' Hun Sen said.
	   Police patrolled in force around the park, but there was no
immediate move against the crowd.
	   Sam Rainsy was huddled with United Nations officials. His party
said any arrest would not be based on evidence and would violate an
agreement Hun Sen had with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The agreement allows opposition leaders who fled Cambodia in the
wake of last year's coup to return to freely contest the elections.
	   Police said two grenades were thrown from one or two passing
motorcycles over the gates of Hun Sen's residence in the capital.
No one was hurt. Hun Sen told reporters that family members,
including his father, were not home at the time.
	   Police said two Chinese-made grenades had exploded. A third that
failed to detonate was found by explosives experts nearby. The only
damage appeared to be a shattered window.
	   Hun Sen seldom stays at the residence, preferring his
fortress-like compound outside the capital.
	   The attack underscored the failure of three days of talks
mediated by King Norodom Sihanouk to find a settlement between Hun
Sen's party and the opposition over the outcome of the elections.
	   Sihanouk, 75, the prince's father, issued a statement ``to
express my deep sorrow about the disgraceful act the terrorists
have committed toward the prime minister.''
	   Hun Sen signaled that the attack marked the end of his patience
and called it ``the true nature of a coup d'etat.''
	   ``They called for soldiers, police to shoot me, to overthrow me.
They called on the U.S. to fire missiles at my house,'' said Hun
Sen, referring to Sam Rainsy.
	   ``But when he could not succeed, he used this act of
terrorism,'' Hun Sen said. ``So I think it has come to a stage
where legal action must be taken against this terrorist leader.''
	   The opposition contends Hun Sen, who has dominated Cambodian
politics since 1985, won the elections by fraud. It has threatened
to deny him the needed two-thirds majority to form a new
government. On his own, Hun Sen controls only 64 of the 122 seats.
	   On March 30, 1997, four grenades were hurled into a protest led
by Sam Rainsy at the same park. At least 16 people were killed and
more than 100 wounded, including Sam Rainsy. The attack was widely
blamed on Hun Sen. He has denied responsibility.
	   Two weeks ago, a grenade was hurled at the headquarters of the
National Election Commission, where Sam Rainsy was protesting the
elections. One person died.
	   No one has ever been arrested or prosecuted.

Big gains from one bourse to another across Asia

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing figures, grafs 5-6 &QL; 
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asia's beleaguered stock markets recorded one
big gain after another Monday, and traders credited everything from
Japan's strengthening yen, to speculation about lower U.S. interest
rates, to new market controls imposed by Malaysia and Hong Kong.
	   In Japan, the yen climbed once again against the U.S. currency,
reaching a four-month high of 131.99 to the dollar by late
afternoon. Japan's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged
747.15 points, or 5.32 percent, closing at 14,790.06.
	   As good as the Nikkei was, Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index
ended at a six-week high, finishing up 588.29 points, or 7.9
percent, at 8,076.76.
	   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index closed at 862.10, a 7
percent increase, its best performance this year.
	   In Thailand, the SET index surged 6 percent to 220.56 points.
	   And in Malaysia, the Composite Index did the best of all,
closing 22.5 percent, or 81.62 points, higher at 445.06. Traders
said the government was manipulating the market.
	   Elsewhere in Asia, the bourses finished 3.9 percent higher in
South Korea, 3 percent in Indonesia, 2.6 percent in Australia, 2.3
percent in the Philippines, and 0.67 percent in Taiwan, where the
government recently imposed new restrictions on the more
speculative types of trading.
	   Yun Sam-wee, an analyst at LG Securities Co. in Seoul, said
investors in South Korea, one of East Asia's hardest-hit economies,
were encouraged by the new stability of Japan's yen and stock gains
across Asia, ``which eased concerns over recent instability in
world financial markets.''
	   Wall Street was closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday. So
traders will have to wait until Tuesday to see whether Asia's
advances affect the fluctuating Dow Jones industrial average.
	   The latest drop in the U.S. dollar's value against the yen was
tied to a hint Friday by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan that American interest rates may have to be cut to
prevent a U.S. recession. Lower interest rates tend to make a
nation's currency less attractive to investors.
	   A stronger yen also benefits other Asian countries, by lifting
the pressure on their battered currencies, and by making it easier
for them to compete with Japanese companies that are trying to
export their way out of Asia's crisis by shipping products to the
West.
	   Japanese stocks also rose on reports that a compromise was being
worked out between ruling party and opposition lawmakers over
efforts to reform Japan's debt-ridden banks. Such a move could
benefit the rest of troubled Asia, given the big role that Japan
plays as the region's key lender.
	   New controls adopted in Hong Kong and Malaysia in an effort to
protect their markets also seemed to help their bourses, even
though the changes have been criticized by free-market economists.
	   In Hong Kong, new measures were announced over the weekend and
on Monday to strengthen the currency board system and to reign in
illegal speculation on the territory's stock and futures markets.
That boosted bank liquidity, cut interest rates sharply, and buoyed
investors' confidence, analysts said.
	   Investors think ``at least for the foreseeable future interest
rates will come down, and it will be more difficult for speculators
to attack the Hong Kong dollar,'' said Percy Au-Young, sales
director at DBS Securities in Hong Kong.
	   In Malaysia, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad went even further
last week, adopting new measures aimed at fixing his country's
economy and firing a top government official he assumed opposed
them: Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   In one of Mahathir's measures, the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange
announced restrictions that effectively ban trading in its shares
outside the country. The government also imposed currency controls
and decreed that investors cannot take money out of Malaysia before
September 1999.
	   While foreign investors were mostly sidelined Monday, local
investment funds, corporations and stock market traders were taking
advantage of what they saw as a domestic rally and perhaps
inevitable bull run on Malaysia's Composite Index, traders said.
	   One trader said the government's investment arm, Permodalan
Nasional Bhd., the Employees Provident Fund and the pilgrims' fund,
Tabung Haji, were actively purchasing shares. And he said that was
one of the main reasons for the big jump in stock prices.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The European Union called Monday on the
voters of Bosnia-Herzegovina to choose a responsible leadership
when they go to the polls in national elections this weekend.
	   In a statement issued by the Austrian foreign minister, the
15-member EU said it stands ready to continue to help the country
recover from the 1992-1995 war, which ended with the Dayton peace
accords.
	   The statement, which will be delivered later Monday to Bosnian
Foreign Minister Jadranko Prlic in Sarajevo, urged Muslim, Croat
and Serb voters to select ``responsible leaders'' who will offer a
peaceful future to the Bosnian people.
	   ``The EU will support you if you held yourself and demonstrate
adherence to your responsibilities under the Dayton Peace Agreement
to build a peaceful, democratic, multi-ethnic, pluralistic and open
state where religious and cultural differences are tolerated and
respected,'' the EU said.
	   It added that the election offers the people of
Bosnia-Herzegovina the opportunity to transform the country into a
state with ``modern European values.''

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Reactor No. 1 at Ukraine's Rivne nuclear
power plant was shut down due to an unspecified malfunction,
officials said Monday.
	   The reactor, which was stopped Sunday, is to be restarted
Tuesday, the state nuclear energy company Energoatom said.
	   Meanwhile, the planned restart of Rivne's reactor No. 2 on
Monday was postponed until the weekend because of unsuccessful
tests following its lengthy repairs, Energoatom said.
	   Malfunctions and disruptions of work at Ukraine's five nuclear
power plants have become more frequent this year, nuclear
authorities said recently.
	   A total of 37 malfunctions were registered in the first half of
1998, which is 1.5 times more than during the same period last
year.
	   Ukraine's nuclear energy sector accounts for more than 40
percent of the former Soviet republic's electricity production.

 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Surgeon to meet with prosecutor on Monday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ A prosecutor is to meet
with a Dominican plastic surgeon today to ask question about the
death of a Puerto Rican patient.
	   Authorities are questioning cosmetic surgeon Edgar Contreras
about an operation performed Aug. 15 on 26-year-old Dhelmalyz Rios
Rivera, a Puerto Rican who traveled to Santo Domingo for plastic
surgery. Rios Rivera died Tuesday from complications related to the
operation.
	   Contreras was detained by Dominican prosecutors for questioning
on Thursday. He was released Saturday night, but told to meet with
the prosecutor on Monday.
	   Under pressure from Puerto Rico, the Dominican director of
health announced an inquiry Wednesday into possible negligence or
illegal medical practices at Contreras' clinic. The clinic, which
the doctor runs with his brother, Frank Contreras, is known for
quick, inexpensive procedures.
	   Rios Rivera had fat drained from her stomach and implanted in
her calves to make them look fuller.
	   Two days later, she was rushed home to Puerto Rico to be treated
for blood poisoning and an embolism that blocked blood vessels.
Doctors amputated both legs below the knee in an unsuccessful
attempt to save her life.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Argentine activist causes furor in Puerto Rico
meeting
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ An Argentine activist's attacks on
the United States have caused an uproar in this U.S. territory's
powerful bar association.
	   During the group's annual convention Saturday, some lawyers
walked out to protest a speech by Hebe Pastor de Bonafini,
president of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo activist group, local
media reported. One lawyer grabbed a microphone and tried to
interrupt the speech. He was restrained by other members.
	   Pastor accused the United States of condoning torture during the
military regime in Argentina between 1976 and 1983. At least 9,000
Argentines disappeared during that period and thousands more were
tortured or executed.
	   ``They put cockroaches in the vaginas of the women and starved
rats to later put them on the bellies of pregnant women,'' Pastor
was quoted as saying in El San Juan Star newspaper. ``The
horrendous things that the United States has done in my country and
in the rest of Latin America cannot be pardoned or forgotten.''
	   The speech enraged members of the association who want Puerto
Rico to become the 51st U.S. state. Pro-statehooders failed to win
control of the group during the association's elections in eastern
Fajardo Saturday night.
 &UR; HAITI: Poet and playwright Morisseau-Leroy dies
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Felix Morisseau-Leroy, a Haitian poet and
playwright who used his native language of Creole in his work, is
dead from complications from a stroke. He was 86.
	   Morisseau suffered from a stroke in February that paralyzed the
left side of his body. He died Saturday.
	   ``He devoted his life to the respect and dignity of all
Haitians,'' said Jan Mapou, who brought Morisseau's groundbreaking
play ``Antigone'' in Creole to Miami for the first time in early
May.
	   ``He is one of the pioneers of the Creole language, which he
advocated as the best tool for the education of Haitian people,''
said Mapou.
	   Using Creole _ the common language of Haitians _ separated
Morisseau from many of his literary contemporaries in the Caribbean
country, who spoke and wrote only in French .
	   Before Morisseau, there was no written Creole. At his play's
premier in 1953 in Port-au-Prince, Creole-speaking Haitians saw a
serious play in their own language for the first time.
	   Morisseau fled Haiti in 1959 and lived in Europe and Africa. His
poems and plays continued to circulate clandestinely in Haiti until
he returned from exile for a visit in 1986.
 &UR; CUBA: Police arrest 36 suspect of stealing milk and rice
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Thirty-six people have been arrested on
charges of looting railway cars carrying rice and milk to eastern
Cuba.
	   The government's Prensa Latina news agency, monitored in Mexico
City, said those arrested were suspected of stealing more than
3,000 bags of rice and about 600 of powdered milk, apparently
destined for the black market.
	   Police investigator Odalys Silva Pena told the weekly Juventud
Rebelde that those arrested include a train engineer and six night
watchmen at the train station in the eastern city of Santiago.
 &UR; BRAZIL: Castro arrives, laments state of world economy
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro says he
will use a Sunday stopover in Brazil to discuss the ``very bad''
state of the world economy with Brazilian counterpart Fernando
Henrique Cardoso.
	   Castro was stopping in Brasilia Sunday after attending a meeting
of non-aligned country leaders in South Africa.
	   He was due to dine with Cardoso in the presidential palace
Sunday night before leaving for Havana on Monday morning.
	   ``The state of the world economy is very bad. I am going to talk
about the threat of the economy with President Cardoso,'' Castro
told The Associated Press.

category codes:
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Divers working in 190-foot
(57-meter) waters have found the flight data recorder of Swissair
Flight 111 and will next try to confirm the location of fuselage
sections which may hold many victims' bodies. The retrieval of the
so-called black box on Sunday was the first major breakthrough for
crash investigators, who are trying to determine why the MD-11
jetliner plunged into the sea Wednesday night, killing all 229
people on board. The flight data recorder will be flown to a
laboratory in Ottawa for examination. If it's in good condition, it
would provide more than 100 types of technical data that could help
explain why the plane's cockpit filled with smoke and why the
pilots' emergency conversation with traffic controllers was cut off
six minutes before the crash. Divers will continue searching for
the second black box _ the cockpit voice recorder that would reveal
other noises in the cockpit in addition to the already available
conversation with controllers. (CANADA-SWISSAIR CRASH)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Accusing the political opposition of
launching a grenade attack against his house Monday, strongman Hun
Sen said his most bitter opponent would be arrested and ordered an
end to weeks of protest against his rule. The attack set the stage
for a violent end to the worsening confrontation between Hun Sen
and the opposition leaders, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam
Rainsy, since disputed parliamentary elections July 26. Hun Sen,
who was not at home during the attack, rejected speculation at a
news conference that he had staged the incident to crack down on
opponents. But he left little doubt he was looking to reassert his
authority. (CAMBODIA)
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government has
arrested 110 members of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's
political party, the party said Monday. The National League for
Democracy said 50 elected members of Parliament were among those
detained in a wave of arrests that began Sunday. The arrests so far
were taking place mainly in provinces outside of the capital,
Yangon, and have included officials of the party's organizing
committees, and members of its youth and women's wings. The
crackdown had been anticipated after the NLD announced last month
it would convene the Parliament elected in 1990. The arrests also
followed the first street protests against military rule in nearly
two years. Last week, as many as 3,000 students protested to demand
the convening of Parliament and greater democracy.
(MYANMAR-ARRESTS)
	   SAR-E-KOTAL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Dawn broke Monday to the thunder
of rocket fire and fighter jets pounding enemy positions on the
Afghan front line, barely 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the
war-ruined capital of Kabul. Taliban soldiers said opposition
troops launched a massive assault near Pul-e-Sufian, north of
Kabul. For several hours both sides waged a blistering rocket duel
which woke residents of this devastated city. ``I woke up because
of the rocket fire and I just sat up and listened with my head
lying like this on the windowsill,'' said Mohammed Shafi, cradling
his head in his arms. At Sar-e-Kotal, a Russian-made tank guarded
the middle of the road, its gun barrel facing battlefields several
kilometers (miles) north. The road winds past a plain and on toward
the hills, past a sprawling graveyard where brightly colored flags
marking hundreds of graves flutter in the breeze.
(AFGHANISTAN-FIGHTING)
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After hearing ``chilling'' reports
about atrocities in Kosovo, the State Department's top human rights
official was expected Monday to press Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic for an independent investigation in the province. John
Shattuck, assistant secretary of state for human rights, and former
U.S. Sen. Bob Dole were to meet Milosevic following a weekend
fact-finding tour of the besieged Serbian province, U.S. diplomats
here said. The Americans and Europeans have tried for months to get
Milosevic to halt his offensive in Kosovo, where hundreds of people
have died and an estimated 265,000 have been driven from their
homes in a crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels. But the efforts
have taken on new urgency with colder weather arriving and as many
as 50,000 people living in the open, left homeless from the
fighting. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main Yugoslav
republic. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The financial secretary on Monday proposed
tougher measures to curb market speculation, including expulsion of
brokers who breach Hong Kong's trading regulations.
	   Donald Tsang said the proposals include the setting up of a body
to regulate the stock and futures markets and the clearing houses,
and giving the territory's chief executive power to give direct
orders to the exchanges.
	   At a special briefing in the legislature, Tsang said the
additional controls were aimed at protecting the territory's
15-year-old currency link to the U.S. dollar by quashing illegal
short selling activities and boosting liquidity in the banking
sector.
	   ``Hong Kong is a fully open market, and we can't crush all
speculators,'' said Tsang, shortly after he walked passed dozens of
protesters opposing government intervention.
	   ``We only aim at speculators who manipulate the markets.''
	   Investors who sell short in both the stock and currency markets
in attempts to drive up interest rates and depress stock prices at
the same time have been blamed for creating chaos in the financial
system.
	   In short-selling, investors borrow stocks or currencies, sell
them, and buy replacements later to return to the lender at a
promised date, hoping the market will go down meanwhile and they
can pocket the difference.
	   Under the new proposals, brokers who repeatedly breach rules on
short-selling would receive heavy penalties and risk losing their
stock exchange membership. Clients and brokers caught in illegal
short-selling would be prosecuted.
	   The market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission,
also is considering outlawing unreported or falsely reported short
selling.
	   It also wants to increase penalties for illegal short selling,
from six months in prison and 10,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
128.20) in fines to two years in prison and fines of 100,000 Hong
Kong dollars (dlrs 1,282).
	   The government already has introduced a series of steps to rein
in short-selling and boost bank liquidity. These measures,
including those announced Monday, were welcomed by banks and
investors.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key barometer of blue chips,
leaped 7.9 percent to 8,076.76 points.
	   ``Stability is the single most important thing for investors,''
said Norman Chan, associate director of investment research for
Allen Perkins Group in Hong Kong. The measures show investors ``the
government is determined to restore order.''
	   Most legislators also supported the new measures, although some
said they had come too late.
	   At the briefing, Tsang also defended the government's recent
stock buying spree, which lifted the stock index by 1,200 points in
two weeks. He said it had prevented a dangerous spike in interest
rates that could have severely damaged Hong Kong's banking system.
	   Without intervention, interbank interest rates could have jumped
to 50 percent and the stock market could have shed up to 3,000
points from its five-year low of 6,660.42, Tsang told legislators.
	   To punish speculators, the government poured in an estimated 15
percent of its U.S. dlrs 96 in reserves to buy stocks to prop the
index to a level where speculators short-selling stock futures were
stuck with huge losses.
	   Tsang said it was his decision to intervene, but he later
consulted with Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa and other officials
and informed the Chinese government.
	   Tsang declined to disclose how much the government has spent on
stocks.
	   Emily Lau, leader of the small, populist Frontier group, said:
``We have a right to know the amount of money spent. People in the
market know.''

Yeltsin lobbies Russian lawmakers to approve prime minister

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia's economy floundering, President Boris
Yeltsin conferred in the Kremlin with his parliamentary foes and
urged them to support his candidate for prime minister in a key
vote Monday.
	   Russia has had an interim government for the past two weeks, and
acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has been struggling to
win confirmation from an opposition-dominated parliament, leaving
little time to devote to the economic crisis.
	   Russia's beleaguered markets received another jolt on Monday
when the ruble crashed again and Central Bank Chairman Sergei
Dubinin offered to resign.
	   Both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin met with the leaders of the
parliamentary factions at the Kremlin, but the Communists and their
allies insisted they would vote against Chernomyrdin on Monday
afternoon.
	   Yeltsin, in his turn, continued pushing for Chernomyrdin's
approval, said presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
	   The participants adjourned without reaching an agreement and
planned to convene again in the afternoon, before parliament voted
on Chernomyrdin.
	   Speaking after the meeting, Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov
reiterated that his faction would vote against Chernomyrdin, but
added that ``it's a dangerous time and we should search for
acceptable solutions.''
	   ``The talk is very tough,'' said Zyuganov, who suggested several
alternative candidates for the prime minister's job.
	   However, Yeltsin has said he won't nominate anyone besides
Chernomyrdin, who held the post for five years before being
dismissed in March.
	   Parliament overwhelmingly rejected Chernomyrdin a week ago, and
if they vote him down again on Monday, Yeltsin can either
renominate him or another candidate for a third vote, which would
take place in about a week's time.
	   If the Duma rejects the president's candidate on the third vote,
then the constitution calls for the president to dissolve the Duma
and call new elections within three months. Yeltsin would
effectively rule by decree during the interim.
	   Chernomyrdin, speaking on national television Sunday, warned
that further delay in forming a new government would exacerbate the
nation's economic woes to such a degree that extreme nationalist
forces might try to take advantage of the turmoil and seize power.
	   ``They will not spare anyone. That would be a tragedy and
catastrophe for Russia,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   He also stressed that Russia still wants aid and cooperation
from the West to help ease the economic crisis, which has seen the
ruble collapse and prices soar.
	   ``Russia is now enmeshed in the global financial system, and
this system doesn't want any collapse,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   Chernomyrdin pledged to avoid backtracking on free-market
reforms and retrenchment into Soviet-style economic isolation
predicted by some.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian Central Bank canceled hard currency
trading on Monday as traders wanted only to buy dollars, not to
sell them. However, currency exchange booths on the streets
remained open.
	   At the start of Monday's trading, the ruble was quoted at 20 to
the U.S. dollar, down from 17 to the dollar on Friday. Deals which
are to take effect on Tuesday pegged the rate as low as 30 rubles a
dollar.
	   The ruble was trading at just over six to the dollar when the
crisis erupted less than a month ago.

Ametistov, prominent Russian judge, dead at 64
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: RECASTS 3rd graf and drops extraneous word `had.' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ernest Ametistov, a member of Russia's highest
court who defended democratic freedoms and spearheaded legal
reforms, died Monday, officials said. He was 64.
	   Ametistov, a member of Russia's Constitutional Court, died at
his country home near Moscow, court officials said. Ametistov's
wife Olga said he died of cancer, which he had battled for months.
	   Ametistov was born in Leningrad _ now St. Petersburg in 1934.
His father was later arrested and executed in Soviet dictator Josef
Stalin's purges.
	   In the late 1950s, Ametistov graduated from the Moscow State
University's law faculty and started working as editor for a state
publishing house. In the following years, he joined research
centers dealing with legal studies, specializing in international
law.
	   In the final years before the Soviet collapse, Ametistov joined
the Memorial human rights group, which supported democratic reforms
and publicized details of abuses carried out during the communist
era.
	   Ametistov was elected a judge of Russia's Constitutional Court
in October 1991 and was known for his persistent efforts to
streamline and liberalize the Soviet-era legal system.
	   In the fall of 1993, when most of the court judges sided with
parliament in its rebellion against President Boris Yeltsin,
Ametistov strongly backed Yeltsin.
	   Ametistov is survived by his mother Raisa, his wife and daughter
Olga. His funeral was planned for Wednesday.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Supporters of ousted Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim vowed Monday to following him across the
nation on his political reformation campaign.
	   ``Justice should prevail _ we want to tell the people the other
side of the story,'' said Ahmad Azam Abdul Rahman, president of the
Muslim Youth Movement of Malaysia, an Islamic group founded by
Anwar in his radical student days.
	   Ahmad Azam told a news conference at Anwar's private residence,
where he has been holed up since Thursday awaiting possible arrest,
that the reform movement would take place with or without its newly
anointed leader.
	   Anwar said he intends to kick off his reform campaign Wednesday
by driving a convoy to his hometown in Penang state in northwestern
Malaysia.
	   He reiterated Monday he does not consider himself a member of
the opposition, but the champion of a new movement.
	   ``I have not suggested that I am contemplating to join any
opposition party or form a new party,'' he told a news conference
late Monday.
	   Some believe he could be arrested before his planned road trip.
	   ``With or without him, we are going to walk, we are going to
explain to the people,'' said Ahmad Azam, noting that the Muslim
Youth Movement had some 100,000 followers.
	   Anwar, 51, was stripped of his official positions of deputy and
finance minister last Wednesday on allegations ranging from sexual
misconduct to leaking state secrets.
	   He has denied the charges, saying they have been floated by the
government to undermine his challenge to the 17-year rule of his
one-time mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   ``Slander and falsehood have become tools of certain
institutions in the country for political maneuvering,'' said Ahmad
Azam. ``This is not an anti-government movement. This is a movement
to clarify that we believe our justice has been trampled by the
government.''
	   He was joined at the news conference by several other religious
and other private organizations that have pledged to join the
movement.
	   They emphasized the reform movement would be peaceful, unlike in
neighboring Indonesia, where riots in May led to 1,200 deaths and
the downfall of President Suharto.
	   ``We want reform in Malaysia, as there is reform in other
countries, including Indonesia, but we want it peacefully,'' said
Fan Yew Teng of the Burma Solidarity Group of Malaysia.
	   Anwar said senior ministers had contacted him and asked him to
understand why they couldn't speak out in his defense.
	   ``They have sent out feelers asking me to be patient and
understand their predicament,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Anwar's adopted brother, Sukma Dermawan, was taken by
police on Sunday and has not been heard from since.
	   ``Four police personnel came and took him away. No communication
so far,'' Anwar said.
	   Police on Monday confirmed the arrest of Sukma, who is a
businessman, but would not say why he was being detained.
	   Sukma is named as one of Anwar's sex partners in a book that is
at the heart of the investigation against the ousted minister. The
police say they are taking the book seriously and investigating its
lurid allegations.
	   Police have filed affidavits in court regarding the
investigation, making public the allegations against Anwar. They
say they intend to complete their investigations into charges of
sexual misconduct, abuse of power and leaking state secrets, before
possible arrest.

Tourist arrival declines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Tourist arrivals to Sri Lanka declined
for the fifth consecutive month, as the Asian financial crisis made
other destinations more attractive, trade officials said Monday.
	   Arrivals declined by 4 percent in July to 29,529 from 30,867 in
July 1997. The Tourist Board added that arrivals in the first seven
months were down 1.2 percent to 202,674 from 205,101 the year
before.
	   Tourism is one of Sri Lanka's top five foreign exchange earners,
fetching about dlrs 209 million in 1997.
	   The government had set a target of around 450,000 arrivals for
all of 1998, but was forced to revise its estimates to around
400,000. Analysts expect about the same number of arrivals this
year as last, when 366,165 foreign tourists visited this Indian
Ocean island off India's southern tip.
	   Competing with cheaper destinations is made more difficult for
Sri Lanka because the country also has the reputation of being a
war zone. The ethnic war is confined to the north and partly to the
east, while tourists generally visit the southern beaches.
	   The growth in arrivals into Sri Lanka from Western Europe and
the Caribbean was restricted to 0.8 percent, while declines were
seen from Britain, Denmark and Japan, the Tourist Board said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Teachers in 10 schools in the Russian Far East
entered the second week of a strike to protest the government's
failure to pay their salaries, a news agency reported.
	   Teachers in the Makarov, Tomari and Tymosvky districts remained
off the job, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. The teachers have not
been paid for the past five months.
	   Most parents of the students at the schools support the
teachers' protest, the agency said.
	   Unpaid wages represent a chronic problem for millions of workers
throughout Russia.

Pakistan plans new package to revive ailing economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan is drafting tough reforms to
shore up its crumbling economy and raise the dlrs 4.5 billion
needed to cover its balance of payments deficit, a high-ranking
government official said Monday.
	   The economy of this southern Asia nation of 130 million people
is burdened with dlrs 32 billion in foreign debt, a desperate
shortage of foreign currency and international economic sanctions
imposed after it tested a series of nuclear devices in May.
	   A six-member team from the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank are expected in Islamabad on Sept. 11 to discuss outside
economic support. The team is likely to demand tough austerity
measures in Pakistan, including government layoffs and tax hikes.
	   ``Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif will announce an economic revival
package (during the) next week or so aimed to bring fundamental
structural reforms in the economy,'' Ahsan Iqbal, deputy chief of
the national planning commission, told The Associated Press.
	   He said the package would include programs to stimulate
industrial, natural resource and agricultural production, boost
exports and reform government institutions and legislation. Iqdal
would not give details until the package is released.
	   ``Without revamping our institutions, slashing down the
administration, removing distortions in our laws and (exercising)
good government, we would be back to square one even if we get
foreign loans,'' he said.
	   Pakistan, which depends on foreign aid to cover its budget
deficit, was jolted when the IMF stopped the one payment of a
phased, three-year, dlrs 1.56 billion loan package as part of
economic sanctions following the nuclear tests.
	   On Friday, Hafeez Pasha, the prime minister's finance adviser,
said Pakistan now needs dlrs 4.5 billion to cover its balance of
payments gap, and hopes to raise the money at home and through such
global lenders as the IMF.
	   Pakistan is expected to face tough conditions for a bailout
package from the IMF, including sharply increased utility rates, a
broader tax base, imposing taxes on agriculture and speeding up the
privatization of state institutions.
	   But Iqbal said Pakistan needed to revamp its economy anyway.
	   ``We are not doing this on some external pressure or over the
dictates of the IMF. We are carrying out these steps because we
think they are right,'' he said.
	   Both Pakistani and IMF officials have said they hope a bailout
package can be agreed on during meetings in Islamabad, and approved
next month by the IMF board.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of student protesters tore
down the gates of Parliament and threw plastic bottles at police
Monday during a demonstration against President B.J. Habibie.
Officers later corralled them in a parking lot on the grounds.
	   Chanting anti-government slogans, at least 2,000 students
gathered outside the green-domed building to demand that Habibie
quit because of his handling of Indonesia's economic crisis.
	   They also urged that former President Suharto be put on trial
for alleged misdeeds, including corruption and repression, during
his 32 years at the helm of the nation of 202 million people.
	   In a separate incident, thousands of people rampaged in a town
in a Central Java province Monday, burning and looting nine
Chinese-owned shops as well as cars.
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis in 30 years and
Chinese people have been made into scapegoats for skyrocketing
inflation, food shortages and mass unemployment.
	   There has been a string of riots around Indonesia over the last
two weeks, including unrest in the northern province of Aceh that
was triggered by anti-military sentiment. Two people died.
	   Riots swept Jakarta in May, killing 1,200 people and helping to
oust Suharto.
	   At Parliament Monday, students ripped the gates off their
hinges, but hundreds of riot police blocked the demonstrators from
entering the grounds. Hours later, they let several hundred
students march into a parking lot on the Parliament grounds.
	   Police also closed off the main highway in front of the
building, where protesters milled, dressed in brightly colored
university jackets. There were students from as many as 40
universities in Jakarta.
	   With permission from the military, students occupied Parliament
in the days before Suharto quit in May, camping out and daubing the
walls with pro-democracy graffiti. Soldiers evicted them after
Suharto's resignation.
	   Habibie is implementing democratic reforms, and has scheduled
general elections next year. Although he is dismantling the legacy
of his autocratic predecessor, there is widespread discontent over
Indonesia's shattered economy.
	   Student demonstrators urged the government to lower the priced
of rice and other basic commodities, which have soared over the
past year. Unemployment is also high, and the economy is expected
to shrink by as much as 15 percent this year.
	   ``Habibie is no good because he can't lower the price of staple
foods,'' said protester Mito Parar. ``That's why we demand again
and again before the Parliament that Habibie step down.''
	   Student protests in recent weeks have lacked the intensity of
the near-daily rallies that helped oust Suharto.

U.N. tribunal to tighten procedures after jailed suspect's death
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
absolved itself of blame Monday in the death of a jailed genocide
suspect, but said it would tighten emergency procedures at the U.N.
detention unit where others are held.
	   An internal inquiry into the Aug. 1 death in custody of Milan
Kovacevic, a Bosnian Serb, found that he died of a ruptured aorta
and that there was no evidence of negligence on the part of the
tribunal, spokesman Christian Chartier said.
	   Kovacevic was the second Serb suspect to die in the tribunal's
detention block. His death triggered angry protests in the
Serb-controlled part of Bosnia and plunged relations between Serbs
and the court to an all-time low.
	   The Yugoslav Justice Ministry accused the tribunal of providing
inadequate medical treatment for Kovacevic, and a pro-government
newspaper ran a headline claiming ``Only Serbs Die in The Hague.''
	   It took prison guards 35 minutes to contact a physician after
Kovacevic first complained of severe pain, and a full hour before
the doctor arrived, revealed the investigation led by tribunal
Judge Almiro Rodrigues of Portugal.
	   But although Rodrigues conceded that ``some criticism may be
leveled against the medical emergency procedures,'' he insisted the
delay was not the cause of death.
	   ``The inquiry revealed no indication of negligence on the part
of the duty doctor ... or any other person,'' Rodrigues concluded.
	   Chartier said medical staff would be given electronic pagers to
make it easier to track them down. He declined to give details of
other corrective measures being taken.
	   The tribunal knew that Kovacevic suffered from the abdominal
aortic aneurysm that killed him and had monitored his condition
closely in the months before his death, the report said. It said
his general health, worsened by a heart condition and other
ailments, was so poor that corrective surgery was not an option.
	   The doctor who treated Kovacevic just before his death did not
detect the rupture of the aneurysm and concluded that he was
suffering from a kidney problem instead, the report said. The
doctor gave Kovacevic a painkiller and went home 75 minutes later
when the pain had subsided.
	   By the time he was called back, Kovacevic's condition had
rapidly deteriorated and he died despite frantic attempts to revive
him.
	   His death ended the U.N. tribunal's first genocide trial.
Kovacevic, a 57-year-old former anesthesiologist, was charged with
genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity for alleged
atrocities committed in northwest Bosnia's Prijedor region in 1992.
He had pleaded innocent to all 15 charges against him and faced a
possible life sentence if convicted.
	   Kovacevic was the second Serb suspect to die in tribunal
custody. In June, Slavko Dokmanovic hanged himself in his cell
while awaiting the verdict in his war crimes trial. An internal
inquiry also cleared the tribunal of blame in that death.
	   Kovacevic, arrested in 1997 by NATO forces in Prijedor, was
accused of overseeing a vicious campaign of arrests, rapes, torture
and slayings of non-Serbs.
	   Prosecutors had accused him of guiding the campaign of
atrocities aimed at driving Muslims and Croats out of Prijedor and
of establishing three infamous prison camps where hundreds of
detainees were tortured and killed.

Thousands gather to protest changes in Ivory Coast constitution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Thousands of opposition supporters
were gathering Monday morning to protest recent changes to the
constitution that give the president sweeping powers.
	   About 10,000 people had gathered by late morning on the edge of
downtown Abidjan, the Ivory Coast's commercial capital. From there,
they planned to march a few kilometers to a rallying point where
opposition leaders were to address the crowd.
	   Some three dozen police in riot gear had set up a barricade in
front of the demonstrators, but they were apparently under order to
allow the group to proceed. Marchers, for their part, sang and
chanted insults at the police as they waited for the demonstration
to begin.
	   The march was going ahead despite government efforts to have it
rescheduled to a weekend.
	   ``Demonstrate, but don't destroy anything,'' Interior Minister
Emile Constant Bombet said in Monday's Le Jour newspaper,
addressing march organizers.
	   Government changes to the constitution, which were approved by
parliament at the end of June, have infuriated opposition leaders,
who have accused President Henri Konan Bedie of wanting to spring a
``constitutional coup d'etat.''
	   Controversy centers on a new article of the constitution which
appears to give the president power to cancel national elections or
delay the announcement of election results.
	   But opposition has also focused on other amendments, which
include extending the presidential mandate from five to seven
years, creating a second chamber - one-third of whose members would
be appointed by the president - and altering majority voting rules.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Divers working in 190-foot
(57-meter) waters have found the flight data recorder of Swissair
Flight 111 and will next try to confirm the location of fuselage
sections which may hold many victims' bodies.
	   The retrieval of the so-called black box on Sunday was the first
major breakthrough for crash investigators, who are trying to
determine why the MD-11 jetliner plunged into the sea off the coast
of the fishing village of Peggy's Cove Wednesday night, killing all
229 people on board.
	   The flight data recorder was flown to a laboratory in Ottawa
where it will be examined Monday. If it's in good condition, it
would provide more than 100 types of technical data that could help
explain why the plane's cockpit filled with smoke and why the
pilots' emergency conversation with traffic controllers was cut off
six minutes before the crash.
	   Divers will continue searching for the second black box _ the
cockpit voice recorder that would reveal other noises in the
cockpit in addition to the already available conversation with
controllers.
	   They also will try to confirm that three large pieces of
wreckage near the flight data recorder are sections of the plane's
fuselage.
	   ``Some of them are squashed. It's in very poor shape, but it is
visible and it looks like an aircraft fuselage,'' said Capt. Phil
Webster, a navy spokesman.
	   Though officials have declined to give an updated figure of how
many bodies have been recovered, they have indicated that most
remain in the sea. Recovery of the fuselage could also lead to
recovery of many more bodies, officials said.
	   A U.S. Navy rescue and salvage ship embarked Sunday from
Philadelphia to assist in the possible recovery of large aircraft
parts.
	   The USS Grapple, which assisted in the deep-sea investigation of
the TWA Flight 800 crash in 1996, carries equipment capable of
lifting 300 tons, plus more than 30 divers. It is expected to reach
Nova Scotia on Wednesday.
	   The Swissair plane, about an hour into its flight from New
York's Kennedy International Airport to Geneva, crashed 16 minutes
after the pilots reported smoke in the cockpit and decided to
attempt an emergency landing. The plane started toward the Halifax
airport, but made two sharp turns as it tried to descend and dump
fuel.
	   In Zurich, Switzerland, Swissair officials said they had
reconstructed the final phase of the flight, based on information
from Canadian investigators. They said the plane couldn't have made
a direct approach to Halifax from where it made the first distress
call because it was flying too high and was too heavy with 30 tons
of fuel meant for the Europe crossing.
	   The call was made 70 miles (112 kilometers) out of Halifax, but
the pilots would have needed 130 miles (208 kilometers) to make a
direct landing, Swissair's chief pilot, Rainer Hiltebrand, said.
However, he said attempting to land in Halifax was still better
than trying for Boston, which the pilots initially suggested to
controllers.
	   Alan Wolk, a U.S. pilot and aviation lawyer, said in a statement
Sunday that Flight 111's pilot, Urs Zimmermann, showed an initial
lack of urgency and should have begun an emergency descent sooner.
	   ``The MD-11 could have been landed overweight without
difficulty,'' Wolk said. ``We have learned from aircraft fires
historically that the only procedure that has a prayer of avoiding
an accident is the quickest possible descent and landing.''
	   At a military air base outside Halifax, pathologists continued
the grim and technically difficult task of trying to identify the
badly fragmented human remains that have been retrieved from the
crash site thus far.
	   Dr. John Butt, Nova Scotia's chief medical examiner, said he has
been groping for gentle ways to convey to the victims' families
that few of them will take possession of mostly intact bodies.
	   Butt also said he had been seeking advice from the medical
officials who handled body identification after the crash of TWA
Flight 800 off the south shore of New York's Long Island. Asked to
compare the state of the bodies in the two crashes, Butt replied,
``This is much more difficult.''
	   More than 300 relatives of Flight 111's victims have flown to
Nova Scotia.
	   Memorials were held through the weekend at Peggy's Cove and in
nearby Halifax.
	   At St. John's Anglican Church in Peggy's Cove, a haggard-looking
Rev. Richard Walsh began his regular Sunday service by noting
``this has been a terrible week.''
	   In his sermon, Walsh told about 25 parishioners that the tiny
village shares in the grief of the families. ``Those people became
spiritually part of our community. We won't forget them.''

Report: North Korea to test ballistic missile on Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ North Korea will test a ballistic missile on
Wednesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Monday.
	   The report was attributed to an unidentified diplomatic source
who was not further identified. ITAR-Tass gave no other details.
	   The United States, South Korea and Japan say North Korea
test-fired a medium-range missile across Japan last week. North
Korea said it launched a ``scientific satellite'' into orbit. No

Turkey says alliance with Israel should not be seen as threat

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Trying to assure Turkey's jittery neighbors,
visiting Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said Monday that his
country's growing military ties with Israel should not be seen as a
threat.
	   His host, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, even suggested that
the alliance could grow. ``It is a cooperation barred to none,''
Netanyahu said in a welcoming ceremony for Yilmaz in Israel.
	   Turkey and Israel have been developing strategic ties since
1996, exchanging warplanes for training, conducting naval maneuvers
and signing several defense and trade deals.
	   Other countries in the region, especially Syria, Egypt and
Greece, have been following the alliance with concern.
	   Israel army radio said in an unattributed report that Yilmaz was
seeking an Israeli promise of military assistance in case of war
between Turkey and Greece in their dispute over control of Cyprus.
	   In July, a Turkish newspaper reported that Turkish warplanes
conducted assault exercises in Israel against Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles _ the same weapons system Greek Cypriots
plan to deploy later this year.
	   Israel has denied the report as ``baseless.''
	   Yilmaz, who is in Israel for a two-day visit, did not address
those reports Monday, but tried to allay the concerns of Turkey's
neighbors.
	   ``I believe the strength of our ties will serve not only the
interest of our respective countries, but also peace and stability
in this region,'' Yilmaz said.
	   ``It is important that the real dimensions of Turkish-Israeli
relations are well understood. Turkish-Israeli cooperation is not
against any other country,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu said last month he hoped the Israeli-Turkish
relationship could form the basis of a regional defense structure.
	   However, Turkey said the time was not ripe for such a step.
	   The Turkish ambassador to Israel, Barlas Oezner, said a regional
alliance could only be formed once Israel had negotiated peace
agreements with its Arab neighbors.
	   ``We need to go step by step,'' Oezner told the Haaretz daily
last week. ``First, there have to be conditions of peace in this
region before we can go further and create a regional framework.''
	   The Turkish prime minister is accompanied by dozens of business
leaders and hopes to expand trade ties with Israel.
	   Earlier Monday, he visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in
Jerusalem.
	   With a somber face, Yilmaz, his wife, four of his Cabinet
ministers and several Turkish business people examined the museum's
photographs depicting the Nazi genocide of 6 million Jews.
	   ``It is our hope that such dark pages in the history of mankind
will never be written again,'' Yilmaz wrote in Yad Vashem's
visitors' book.

Malta's Labor premier resigns after election seen as EU referendum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with final vote count, edits to conform &QL;

<TEXT>
	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ The conservative Nationalist Party swept
to Malta's biggest election victory since World War II, claiming it
as a mandate for the island nation's drive to join the European
Union.
	   Premier Alfred Sant of the Labor Party, who had put an EU bid on
hold, resigned after conceding defeat Sunday, even as counting of
Saturday's written balloting for parliament continued. Nationalist
leader Eddie Fenech Adami was immediately sworn in.
	   Election officials said Monday that final results showed the
Nationalists with 51.8 percent of the vote, to 46.9 for Labor. The
remaining votes went to a tiny environmentalist party.
	   The previous largest percentage won was 51.7 percent by the
Nationalists in 1992. In the last election two years ago, Labor won
with 50.7 percent of the vote.
	   There was no immediate breakdown of seats in parliament.
	   Early Monday, Maltese started to celebrate in the streets. Boys
wore the Nationalist party flag as a cape and girls tied minute
flags around their necks as scarves as they strolled the streets.
	   Scattered traffic jams developed as people drove around in cars
draped with the flags of the winning party and of the European
Union.
	   Fenech Adami, who pushed for EU entry for this tiny crossroads
in the Mediterranean while premier from 1987-1996, told wildly
cheering supporters: ``The first thing that I am going to do is to
inform the EU that the Maltese people want membership.''
	   His 1987 victory had ended 16 years of Labor governments whose
then pro-Libyan stands often angered Western governments.
	   Sant had contended that Malta's economy, which includes
government protection for industry and a large state sector, wasn't
ready for the economic discipline required by Brussels.
	   The Nationalists said EU funds would pay for such projects as
roads to help Malta's biggest money-maker_tourism.
	   Sant had gambled that calling elections three years early would
strengthen his socialists' one-vote majority in the 65-seat
parliament.
	   Shops and businesses stayed closed on Monday for fear of
post-election violence. The Maltese are very passionate about their
political leanings, with roughly half the country diehard
Nationalists and the other half pro-Labor.
	   But compared to previous elections, streets had relatively few
numbers of horn-honking, drum-beating, fireworks-exploding
supporters. It was unclear whether supporters were respecting calls
by both winners and losers for calm or whether a televised
Malta-Macedonia soccer match kept many Maltese at home.

Thousands burn shops in anti-Chinese riot in Indonesian town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of people rampaged in a town
in Central Java province Monday, burning and looting Chinese-owned
shops and cars, residents and police said.
	   Police said nine shops were burned down and many others were
damaged by mobs in Kebumen, about 350 kilometers (218 miles)
southeast of Jakarta.
	   There were no reports of injuries. One man was arrested, police
said.
	   Hundreds of people remained on the streets as night fell after
dozens of police and troops tried to restore order.
	   Security forces blocked roads into the town, said one resident
who identified himself by the single name of Achmad.
	   He said by telephone that trouble broke out after a fight
between a local man and an ethnic Chinese shopkeeper.
	   ``I saw Chinese shops burned and others damaged and looted,'' he
said, adding that rioters also set a number of cars and motorcycles
afire.
	   In some places, mobs piled goods out in the street and set them
ablaze.
	   Monday's riot was the latest in a series to hit crisis-ridden
Indonesia recently.
	   Last week, two people were killed and 12 were injured when riots
erupted in Lhokseumawe on the northern tip of Sumatra Island, an
area that endured years of repression by Indonesia's military
following a separatist uprising in the late 1980s.
	   Those riots came after a major pullout by the army, but the mobs
soon turned on members of the ethnic Chinese minority.
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis in 30 years and
Chinese people have been made into scapegoats for skyrocketing
inflation, food shortages and mass unemployment.
	   Violence against the Chinese also flared in the months before
former President Suharto resigned in May, ending 32 years of
authoritarian rule.
	   In Jakarta, at least 2,000 student protesters tore down the
gates outside the Parliament and threw plastic bottles at police
Monday during a demonstration against Suharto's successor,
President B.J. Habibie.
	   Hundreds of riot police blocked the demonstrators from entering
the grounds. Police also closed off the main highway in front of
the building, where protesters milled, dressed in brightly colored
university jackets.

Negotiators seek to arrange talks with Congo, rebels

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ African leaders gathering to
seek an end to civil war in Congo worked Monday to find a method to
get both sides talking about peace.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila has refused to meet face-to-face
with rebels who now control a quarter of his vast mineral-rich
central African country.
	   The rebels, who were not included at two previous summits over
the past month, were to arrive later Monday for the talks with
Kabila, and the presidents of Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Uganda and
Rwanda.
	   Congolese military official Francois Olenga said Kabila's
delegation will resist attempts to persuade them to meet with
rebels at this northwest Zimbabwe resort.
	   ``They are not rebels. They are invaders,'' he said.
	   Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia have sent troops to Congo to
support Kabila. Uganda and Rwanda are accused by Kabila of sending
troops to back the rebels.
	   Before the presidents began talks around noon, officials huddled
in numerous meetings seeking to devise a method that would allow
all the warring factions to discuss terms of a cease-fire and
withdrawal of all foreign troops.
	   They also discussed the establishment of a African peacekeeping
force, possibly to come under the control of the continent-wide
Organization of African Unity.
	   Such a force would enable foreign troops currently in the
conflict to withdraw, officials said.
	   ``This summit will bring a solution to the conflict,'' a
confident Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos said when he
arrived at the summit site Monday morning.
	   It appeared Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, the neutral
chairman of the summit called by President Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe, might have to shuttle between the two sides in an effort
to forge an agreement.
	   Zimbabwean officials said the rebel delegation will be led by
Arthur Zahaidi Ngoma and will include former Congolese Foreign
Minister Bizima Karaha.
	   Salim Ahmed Salim, the secretary-general of the Organization of
African Unity, said the aim of the talks was to reach a cease-fire
agreement that would insure the continuation of Kabila's government
but also bring about democratic reforms.
	   Kabila has been trying to suppress a rebel insurrection since
late July. When the rebels were marching on Kinshasa, the capital,
troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia intervened on behalf of
Kabila.
	   Kabila contends the rebels are sponsored by Rwanda and Uganda, a
charge the two countries deny, and has said he will not agree to a
cease-fire until all Rwandan and Ugandan troops withdraw from
Congo.
	   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said a crucial part of the
discussion would be democratic reform in Congo. Hopes for free
elections rose when Kabila last year overthrew dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko, ending three decades of tyrannical rule.
	   Kabila has promised free elections, but he also has arrested
opposition activists and stirred up ethnic enmities.
	   In behind-the-scene discussions at last week's Nonaligned
Movement summit in Durban, South Africa, regional leaders
reportedly agreed in principle to withdraw troops to the border
regions, where they can monitor security, according to media
reports in South Africa.
	   Rwanda, Uganda and Angola claim that Congo harbors opponents to
their respective governments, and stationing their troops at the
borders would help keep such forces out, The Sunday Times of
Johannesburg reported.
	   Officials say Kabila, as part of any agreement for a cease-fire,
also demands that the summit devise a method of registering rebels
and ways of ascertaining their nationality to make sure they are
Congolese.

U.N. tribunal to tighten procedures after jailed suspect's death
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal
absolved itself of blame Monday in the death of a jailed genocide
suspect, but said it would tighten emergency procedures at the U.N.
detention unit where others are held.
	   An internal inquiry into the Aug. 1 death of Milan Kovacevic, a
Bosnian Serb, found he died of a ruptured aorta and that there was
no evidence of negligence on the part of the tribunal, spokesman
Christian Chartier said.
	   Kovacevic was the second Serb suspect to die in the tribunal's
detention block. His death triggered angry protests in the
Serb-controlled part of Bosnia and plunged relations between Serbs
and the court to an all-time low.
	   The Yugoslav Justice Ministry accused the tribunal of providing
inadequate medical treatment, and a pro-government newspaper ran a
headline claiming ``Only Serbs Die in The Hague.''
	   It took prison guards 35 minutes to contact a physician after
Kovacevic first complained of severe pain, and a full hour before
the doctor arrived, according to the investigation led by tribunal
Judge Almiro Rodrigues of Portugal.
	   Although Rodrigues conceded that ``some criticism may be leveled
against the medical emergency procedures,'' he insisted the delay
was not the cause of death.
	   ``The inquiry revealed no indication of negligence on the part
of the duty doctor ... or any other person,'' Rodrigues concluded.
	   Chartier said medical staff would be given electronic pagers to
make it easier to track them down. He declined to give details of
other corrective measures.
	   The tribunal knew Kovacevic suffered from the abdominal aortic
aneurysm and monitored his condition closely in the months before
his death, the report said. It said his general health, worsened by
a heart condition and other ailments, was so poor that corrective
surgery was not an option.
	   The doctor who treated Kovacevic just before his death did not
detect the rupture of the aneurysm and concluded he was suffering
from a kidney problem instead, the report said. The doctor gave
Kovacevic a painkiller and went home 75 minutes later when the pain
subsided.
	   By the time he was called back, Kovacevic's condition had
rapidly deteriorated and died despite frantic attempts to revive
him.
	   His death ended the U.N. tribunal's first genocide trial.
Kovacevic, a 57-year-old former anesthesiologist, was charged with
genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity for alleged
atrocities committed in northwest Bosnia's Prijedor region in 1992.
He pleaded innocent to all 15 charges against him and faced a
possible life sentence if convicted.
	   Kovacevic was the second Serb suspect to die in tribunal
custody. In June, Slavko Dokmanovic hanged himself in his cell
while awaiting the verdict in his war crimes trial. An internal
inquiry also cleared the tribunal of blame in that death.
	   Kovacevic, arrested in 1997 by NATO forces in Prijedor, was
accused of overseeing a vicious campaign of arrests, rapes, torture
and slayings of non-Serbs.
	   Prosecutors accused him of guiding the campaign of atrocities
aimed at driving Muslims and Croats out of Prijedor and of
establishing three infamous prison camps where hundreds of
detainees were tortured and killed.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ North Korea will test a ballistic missile on
Wednesday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Monday.
	   The report was attributed to an unidentified diplomatic source
who was not further identified. ITAR-Tass gave no other details.
	   However, the Russian Foreign Ministry said it had no information
about a planned missile test by North Korea, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The United States, South Korea and Japan say North Korea
test-fired a medium-range missile that sailed over Japan last week.
North Korea said it launched a ``scientific satellite'' into orbit.
No country has been able to officially confirm or deny North
Korea's statement.

Explosives found in garbage can in Prague
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Five packages containing
explosives and detonators were found in a garbage can near a subway
station in Prague late Sunday, police said Monday.
	   Spokesman Jiri Soucek said police retrieved the packages _ each
containing 75 grams of TNT _ after receiving an emergency call from
a man who had found them in the can just outside the city center.
	   Soucek said two detonators, four smoke cartridges and 42 signal
rockets were found along with the packages.
	   The discovery came only hours after a Spaniard and a Dutch woman
were lightly injured by a bomb planted in a garbage can in downtown
Prague.
	   The bomb went off early Sunday afternoon in an area popular with
foreign tourists.
	   Shortly before midnight Thursday, a man lost both his legs and
suffered burns over 40 percent of his body when an explosive went
off.
	   Chemist Vladimir Jiricek, 47, was apparently throwing out
spoiled results of one of his experiments when it exploded in a
garbage can in front of his apartment.
	   Soucek said police knew of no connection between the three
incidents.

Georgian currency rebounds after a sharp drop

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with lari rebounding, details; trims &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA DZHINDZHIKHASHVILI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze
on Monday sought to reassure jittery citizens that the nation's
financial situation was stable, and Georgia's currency rebounded
after a sharp fall.
	   Responding to the economic and political crisis in Russia, the
Georgian lari fell to as low as 1.7 to the U.S. dollar on Sunday
afternoon from 1.38 over the previous week.
	   But the currency rose to 1.35 Monday after Georgia's central
bank sold dlrs 2.9 million on the interbank currency exchange,
nearly three times as much as on a usual day.
	   ``We had to take this step because of the panic,'' said chief
National Bank dealer Soso Pkhakadze.
	   On Sunday, many Georgians rushed to the exchange points to buy
dollars, fearing a further drop in the Georgian currency. With
prices in stores across the capital Tbilisi rising by 10 to 20
percent, many also were stocking up on consumer goods, trying to
spend their money before it lost its value.
	   Georgia, a former Soviet republic, had been largely unaffected
by the Russian crisis. But many Georgians are engaged in trading
with Russia, and feared that economic conditions would deteriorate.
	   Shevardnadze, in his regular weekly radio address on Monday,
said the lari's downfall was caused by a ``psychological factor.''
	   ``Upon a detailed analysis we have come to a conclusion that
there are no grounds for the fall of the lari rate,'' he said. ``No
financial hurricanes on the territory of neighboring nations will
damage the lari.''
	   National Bank chief Irakli Managadze also issued assurances and
insisted that the lari was stable.
	   ``That was an artificial rate ... an ordinary speculation that
created panic,'' Managadze said on national television.
	   Street currency trading resumed Monday after a morning
suspension, with the dollar being sold to traders at 1.35 lari and
bought at 1.38.

Malaysia to meet Jamaica in opening match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Host Malaysia will meet Jamaica in
the opening match of the men's team event of the Commonwealth Games
badminton competition Wednesday.
	   The first match in the women's team event is between top-seeded
New Zealand and Trinidad and Tobago, according to the draw released
Monday by the badminton organizing committee.
	   Top-seeded Malaysia plays its second match against Northern
Ireland on Thursday before taking on Canada on Saturday.
	   The Kiwi women play Mauritius on Thursday before meeting the
Malaysian women Saturday.
	   Commonwealth Games badminton manager Johnny Quek said some
matches would have to be played Friday, the day of the opening
ceremony, when no event was originally scheduled, so that every
team had the same amount of rest time.
	   Nineteen countries are competing in the men's team event. There
are 16 women's teams.
	   The team finals will be held next Monday and the players will
take a one-day rest before individual events begin Sept. 16.
	   Because of the increase in competitors, the games will be the
first to begin events two days before the opening ceremony.
	   More than 6,000 athletes and officials from 70 countries are
participating in the games.

Abdullah to visit Europe, United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Crown Prince Abdullah will embark on
a three-nation tour next week that will take him to Britain, France
and the United States, the prince's office said Monday.
	   Abdullah will fly to Britain on Saturday, then to France Sept.
16 before heading to the United States Sept. 19, his office said.
	   During the two-week trip, Abdullah will discuss the stalled
Middle East peace process and regional security issues, according
to officials in his office who spoke on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   He also hope to encourage more European and American investment
in Saudi Arabia, they said.
	   After a brief vacation, Abdullah plans an Asian tour to include
Pakistan, China, Japan and South Korea.
	   Since Saudi King Fahd suffered a stroke in 1995, Abdullah has
been running the country's day-to-day affairs.
	   Abdullah is seen as less pro-American than Fahd and has
expressed concern about Washington's uncritical support for Israel.
Peace negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel have
faltered since the election in 1996 of hard-liner Benjamin
Netanyahu as Israeli prime minister.
	   Saudi Arabia, with the world's largest oil reserves, has been
facing budget problems because of low oil prices on international
markets. The kingdom has been trying to lure foreign investment as
part of its efforts to diversify its economy into non-oil areas.
	   British, French and American forces are stationed in Saudi
Arabia to help patrol a ``no-fly'' zone over southern Iraq that was
set up after the 1991 Gulf War to protect Shiite Muslims from the
Iraqi regime.
	   Abdullah's last trip overseas was in May, when he visited Syria
and Jordan. He also visited Lebanon last year.

Daily showers cast doubts on opening ceremony
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Worried that heavy downpours could
wash out Friday's opening ceremony, organizers of the 1998
Commonwealth Games said Monday they were looking for special
equipment to drain water from the main arena.
	   Rain was the main the problem facing the elaborate opening
ceremony, said Abdul Manap Ibrahim, chief operating officer of the
games' organizing committee.
	   ``We need to clear the water from the surface so that the
performers will not slip during their routines. More equipment will
be placed on standby to clear up any puddles of water,'' said
Muhyiddin.
	   Marchers may be given transparent raincoats, he said.
	   A few performances had to be canceled because of heavy rain
during a rehearsal Sunday but they would be held on Friday, Abdul
Manap was quoted as saying by Bernama news agency.
	   Almost every day in the last week, skies have darkened in late
afternoon and heavy rain has poured. It rained again Monday around
the time the opening ceremony is scheduled to start.
	   Thousands of performers, including schoolchildren participating
in the choreographed show, were drenched. The ceremony is to
feature several local musicians and singers and a brass band drawn
from 14 schools.
	   ``I am proud of the performers who are basically young children.
They behaved like professionals out there despite the rain,'' said
Sports Minister Muhyiddin Yassin.
	   A second rehearsal was scheduled Wednesday at the Bukit Jalil
stadium, which can accommodate 100,000 spectators.

EU antitrust chief meets Super League backers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's antitrust chief
met with representatives of Italy's Media Partners company Monday
to discuss its plans to start up a European ``super league''
competition, officials said.
	   EU Commissioner Karel Van Miert called for additional
information on the controversial plan to revamp Europe's soccer
landscape after the Italian company said its blueprint would be
finalized ``shortly,'' said EU spokesman Stefan Rating.
	   Media Partners promised to notify the EU's executive Commission
of upcoming developments.
	   The EU Commission can check whether companies become too
dominant on the 15-nation market and infringe European competition
rules.
	   Milan-based Media Partners has said that it was confident the
Europe-wide league, grouping many of the most famous clubs, would
be able to kick off in 2000.
	   The UEFA European soccer federation opposes the breakaway league
and has set up a task force to investigate ways of restructuring
its own tournaments.

Minister warns press on political coverage during games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The foreign media were warned
Monday not to cloud their coverage of the Commonwealth Games with
details of the country's political upheaval.
	   Hundreds of journalists are arriving to cover the 16th
Commonwealth Games, which officially begin Friday. But they likely
also will focus on ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who
is also the former finance minister.
	   Anwar was sacked last week on allegations of sexual misconduct
and leaking state secrets.
	   Minister of Information Mohamed Rahmat said he was not pleased
by the reports of some foreign media.
	   ``Their reports are politically inclined and aimed solely at
toppling the government leadership,'' the national news agency
Bernama reported Mohamed as saying.
	   ``They had big ambitions to topple the Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad and bring up the Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
Actually they have failed,'' he said.
	   The minister also warned local and foreign journalists to wear
the press accreditation cards issued by the Information Department
when covering official events.
	   Mohamed complained that some foreign journalists were not
wearing them when covering official functions. What he declined to
mention was that it can take up to a year to get a press card
issued by his ministry.
	   Mohamed said there were about 50 local journalists working with
foreign news agencies.

Anne Frank Foundation hunting for missing film footage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Guardians of Anne Frank's legacy
revealed Monday they've been searching for original film footage of
the Jewish diarist that disappeared years ago, possibly in the
United States.
	   The black-and-white, silent footage contains fleeting images of
the teen-ager who penned the famous diary documenting her two years
of life in hiding from the Nazis.
	   Although there are several copies, the original reel hasn't been
seen since it was loaned to an unidentified American documentary
maker in the 1980s, said the Amsterdam-based Anne Frank Foundation.
	   The foundation realized it was missing in 1995 but kept the
embarrassing disappearance under wraps until this past weekend,
when the Dutch television newsmagazine Network reported the loss.
	   ``Most probably, the original was not returned,'' said Ita
Amahorseija of the Anne Frank Foundation, which runs a museum in
the Amsterdam canal house where Anne and her family hid in a secret
annex behind a movable bookcase.
	   The footage of Anne, shot in 1941 before her family went into
hiding, was made by an amateur cameraman who was actually filming
the wedding day of Anne's neighbors.
	   The camera focused on the bridal couple coming out of an
apartment building, but panned upwards fleetingly for about seven
seconds, showing a young Anne leaning out of a window watching the
couple. Anne then turned her head backwards and spoke to someone
else in the room.
	   Because copies exist, the original probably has more sentimental
than historical value to those who have devoted their lives to
researching Anne and the Holocaust she came to symbolize.
	   The footage was included in documentaries in the United States
and Germany in the 1960s. In more recent time, it was seen in the
documentary ``Anne Frank Remembered,'' which won an Academy Award
in 1996.
	   Word of the missing footage comes amid a fuss over the discovery
of previously unpublished pages of ``The Diary of Anne Frank.''
Squabbles over royalties and copyrights, as well as publications of
two new biographies on Anne, have also revived interest in her life
and diary.
	   Anne and her family were sent to Nazi death camps after their
hiding place was betrayed in August 1944. Anne died of typhus in
the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, just weeks before it was
liberated in the spring of 1945.

Japan lifts warning against travel to Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan has eased a warning against traveling to
Indonesia after judging that security there has improved, a Foreign
Ministry official said Monday.
	   Japan lifted a high-level travel warning adopted for Indonesia
in May, when riots rocked the nation and forced President Suharto
to resign, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Japan had warned its citizens staying in Indonesia to leave the
country and advised those traveling there to cancel their plans.
	   The government still advises Japanese in most parts of Indonesia
to exercise caution, though it has completely lifted its caution
for travelers to the popular Indonesian resort island of Bali, the
official said.
	   Security conditions in Indonesia have stabilized since new
President B.J. Habibie took office in late May and began
implementing democratic reforms, the official said.

Northwest pilot strike affects 60,000 passengers in Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The pilot strike at Northwest Airlines has forced
the cancellation of flights out of Japan affecting 60,000
passengers so far, the company said Monday.
	   Northwest is the second largest airline to fly out of Japan and
the biggest among foreign airlines, with around 200 flights per
week. Pilots went on strike Aug. 28.
	   ``The (revenue) loss is enormous,'' Koji Nagata, a spokesman for
Northwest, told Dow Jones Newswires. He did not supply an estimate
of how much revenue had been lost.
	   As of Monday, Northwest had canceled all U.S. domestic flights
and all U.S.-departing international flights through Sept. 9,
Nagata said. In addition, all flights originating in Asia and in
Europe have been canceled through Sept. 11, he said.
	   The airline's 6,100 pilots have been negotiating a new contract
for the past two years. They have asked for a 14 percent salary
increase over three years. Northwest has offered 9 percent over
four years.
	   Negotiators from Northwest and the Air Line Pilots Association,
the union representing the striking pilots, were expected to meet
again Tuesday, Nagata said.
	   To deal with affected passengers, Japan Airlines Co., the
biggest airline flying out of Japan, said it has accepted
passengers on its own regularly scheduled flights and has also
added 11 special flights for Northwest passengers.
	   In total, JAL has accepted around 10,000 Northwest passengers, a
JAL spokesman said. He added that JAL currently has no plans to add
further extra flights.
	   All Nippon Airways Co. said it has added no special flights for
Northwest passengers, but had accepted around 1,000 of those
passengers on its own regularly scheduled flights as of last
Thursday.
	   Northwest has contracted with more than 60 airlines to accept
passengers on its canceled flights, the airline said.
	   A strike by pilots of Air Canada is also causing disruption in
Japan.
	   A daily code-share flight service with ANA between Kansai
Airport near Osaka and Vancouver using Air Canada aircraft has been
temporarily canceled, an ANA spokeswoman said.
	   JAL said it has accepted some passengers from canceled Air
Canada flights.
	   The Air Canada pilots' strike _ over pay and working conditions
_ began last Tuesday. No formal talks are scheduled between the
airline and its striking pilots, though both sides have indicated a
desire for early talks.

Anne Frank Foundation hunting for missing film footage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Guardians of Anne Frank's legacy
revealed Monday that they've been searching for original film
footage of the Jewish diarist that disappeared years ago, possibly
in the United States.
	   The black-and-white, silent footage contains fleeting images of
the teen-ager who penned the famous diary documenting her two years
of life in hiding from the Nazis.
	   Although there are several copies, the original reel hasn't been
seen since it was lent to an unidentified American documentary
maker in the 1980s, said the Amsterdam-based Anne Frank Foundation.
	   The foundation realized it was missing in 1995 but kept the
embarrassing disappearance under wraps until this past weekend,
when the Dutch television newsmagazine Network reported the loss.
	   ``Most probably, the original was not returned,'' said Ita
Amahorseija of the Anne Frank Foundation, which runs a museum in
the Amsterdam canal house where Anne and her family hid in a secret
annex behind a movable bookcase.
	   The footage of Anne, shot in 1941 before her family went into
hiding, was made by an amateur cameraman who was actually filming
the wedding day of Anne's neighbors.
	   The camera focused on the bridal couple coming out of an
apartment building, but panned upwards fleetingly for about seven
seconds, showing a young Anne leaning out of a window watching the
couple. Anne then turned her head backwards and spoke to someone
else in the room.
	   Because copies exist, the original probably has more sentimental
than historical value to those who have devoted their lives to
researching Anne and the Holocaust she came to symbolize.
	   The footage was included in documentaries in the United States
and Germany in the 1960s. In more recent time, it was seen in the
documentary ``Anne Frank Remembered,'' which won an Academy Award
in 1996.
	   Word of the missing footage comes amid a fuss over the discovery
of previously unpublished pages of ``The Diary of Anne Frank.''
Squabbles over royalties and copyrights, as well as publications of
two new biographies on Anne, have also revived interest in her life
and diary.
	   Anne and her family were sent to Nazi death camps after their
hiding place was betrayed in August 1944. Anne died of typhus in
the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, just weeks before it was
liberated in the spring of 1945.

Talks start on forming new Northern Ireland government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With NIreland-Glance
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant and Catholic leaders
opened discussions Monday on how to share power in a new
government, beginning another chapter in Northern Ireland's quest
for compromise.
	   Eight party leaders _ including Ulster Unionist leader David
Trimble and Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams _ gathered at Stormont
Parliamentary Building, within the British government complex where
they struck April's peace accord.
	   Their chief goal in coming weeks is to agree who should form a
12-member administration, called the Executive, to be drawn from
the largest parties.
	   Most seats are reserved for Trimble's Ulster Unionists, chief
representative of the north's British Protestant majority, and John
Hume's Social Democratic and Labor Party, which gets the most
Catholic votes.
	   But all eyes were on relations between Trimble and Adams, whose
IRA-allied party remains committed to unraveling Northern Ireland's
union with Britain _ and expects to receive two Executive
positions.
	   Since being elected Ulster Unionist leader in 1995, Trimble has
refused to talk directly with Adams, arguing that the Irish
Republican Army needed first to start disarming as proof that it
had really renounced its violent campaign to destabilize Northern
Ireland.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton made Stormont his first stop
Thursday during his visit to Northern Ireland, when he appeared
frequently alongside Trimble and emphasized the need for IRA
disarmament, but he also praised Adams' role in peacemaking.
	   On Saturday, Trimble announced he would meet Adams sometime this
week to discuss terms for Sinn Fein's participation in government.
Also at that meeting will be Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of Hume's
moderate party, which has long competed with Sinn Fein for Catholic
votes.
	   While April's agreement specified that the IRA should disarm
under international supervision by mid-2000, it set no deadline for
that process to start.
	   And as he walked up the grand front stairway of Stormont, Adams
emphasized that it would ``run totally contrary to the agreement''
if Trimble used the outlawed IRA's arsenal as a way to block the
legal Sinn Fein from taking its place in the Executive.
	   ``Obviously, we have a long piece of the road to travel yet.
There is obviously reluctance within unionism, and in some quarters
an outright hostility, to implementing this agreement,'' Adams
said. ``I think Mr. Trimble will increasingly understand that he
has to do his job.''
	   Northern Ireland's as-yet-powerless legislative Assembly must
approve any proposed administration by a majority of both its
Protestant and Catholic blocs, not just a bare majority.
	   The 108-seat Assembly was elected in June, has met just once _
to elect Trimble first minister of the unformed Executive and
Mallon its deputy first minister _ and will reconvene next Monday
at Stormont.
	   While Catholic support for any compromise Executive looks
certain, the Protestant side of the house is bitterly divided.
	   At every critical juncture, the Ulster Unionists have split
ranks over the continued presence of Sinn Fein. Hours after Trimble
announced he would meet Adams, four of his party's 10 members of
British Parliament criticized him as foolish and weak.
	   Trimble, in turn, emphsized he wouldn't shake Adams' hand.

U.N. rights chief begins China mission, gets calls for help

U.N. treaty dissident actions &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Seeking ``practical ways'' to promote human
rights in China, U.N. rights chief Mary Robinson pressed Chinese
leaders Monday on when they will sign a key human rights treaty.
	   Robinson, at the start of the first ever official mission to
China by a U.N. high commissioner for human rights, signed an
agreement on cooperation between her office and China.
	   The agreement _ signed with Assistant Foreign Minister Wang
Guangya _ offers China help, if requested, in developing plans to
meet commitments under international treaties and the Vienna World
Conference on Human Rights, held five years ago.
	   At the signing ceremony, Robinson described her mission as ``an
opportunity to begin a serious process of cooperation,'' and said
she hoped to work with the government to find ``practical ways to
promote and protect human rights.''
	   Such careful talk is seen as crucial to Robinson's and Chinese
leaders' desires to end the confrontation that has marked relations
between her office and China for most of the past decade.
	   Speaking before an audience of legal experts, Robinson said
China has made ``important progress'' in human rights. She urged
Chinese leaders to provide a yardstick for future gains by signing
the U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, something they
pledged to do six months ago.
	   ``I am very eager to know when China will sign the Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights. It has of course been clearly, publicly
signaled that this will be in the fall,'' Robinson said. She added
that Assistant Foreign Minister Wang assured her ``the fall'' meant
``September, October, November.''
	   The covenant _ and another treaty China has signed but not
ratified _ provide baseline guarantees of such fundamental rights
as free speech and assembly.
	   Although China's constitution gives citizens those rights, they
are seldom protected in practice. Aggrieved dissidents and their
family members were hoping that Robinson's visit _ which includes a
trip to Tibet _ might encourage improvements.
	   Two dissidents, Leng Wanbao and An Fuxing, used Robinson's
arrival to apply for government permission to form a rights group,
a Hong Kong-based dissident monitoring group reported. Registration
is required by law, but routinely denied for such groups.
	   The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement
in China said Monday that dissidents and families of imprisoned
activists had entrusted it with open letters to pass on to her.
	   One of the letters, signed by 139 democracy campaigners,
protested the sentencing of Zhao Changqing, a teacher in northern
China's Shaanxi province who tried to run for local office, to
three years in prison for disrupting social order.
	   Xu Hong of Shanghai wrote on behalf of her husband, Lin Hai, a
software company director detained since March for giving 30,000
Chinese e-mail addresses to a dissident on-line magazine.
	   Others protested the right of police to send detainees to labor
camps for up to four years without trial; the authorities' failure
to let an activist facing a charge of subversion see a lawyer; and
the government's refusal to let dissidents in exile return to
China.

German soccer coach under growing pressure to step down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A new beginning may have a familiar
ending _ sooner than expected.
	   German coach Berti Vogts came under growing pressure Monday to
step down following two dismal exhibition performances by his
new-look, old-faults national team.
	   ``Berti, how much longer?'' screamed a banner front-page
headline in the mass-circulation Bild newspaper.
	   Major newspapers united Monday in suggesting the only way out of
Germany's soccer crisis was for Vogts to resign.
	   The team returned Sunday from a week in Malta, where it
practiced and played two exhibition games, a slim 2-1 win over
lowly Malta and a 1-1 come-from-behind draw with Romania.
	   The trip was supposed to mark a new beginning for the national
team, which was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the World Cup
this summer in France.
	   Vogts invited eight rookies and recalled ``enfant terrible''
midfielder Stefan Effenberg after a four-year absence. But
Effenberg never lived up to expectations and the Germans were a
long way off from playing creative and attractive soccer.
	   Instead, Bild said, television viewers at home ``were tortured
with horrible soccer.''
	   Vogts lost another chunk of his fading authority when he was
forced to abandon his new system and revert to using a sweeper, or
libero, in the second halftime against Romania.
	   The German coach had attempted to introduce a more up-to-date
zone defense system, but the players failed to adapt to the new
roles and demanded a return to the old libero system.
	   ``Back to the stone age,'' commented the influential
Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
	   Germany has been using the libero system with two man markers,
or stoppers, for nearly 30 years, since the days of Franz
Beckenbauer. Vogts wanted to switch to the zone defense used by
most of the top teams but the change seemed beyond his players.
	   ``We could not adjust, we were completely confused,'' said
midfielder Mario Basler.
	   Germany's shortcomings were plainly visible even against Malta.
The Germans were helped by an own goal from Malta and won only on a
fortunate late goal. Past German teams would have easily scored a
half-dozen goals against Malta, which was routed 4-0 over the
weekend by Macedonia, itself no soccer giant.
	   Vogts was already severely criticized after Germany's 3-0
quarterfinal ouster by Croatia and its lackluster World Cup
performance overall.
	   But Vogts said he would stay on and attempt a new beginning for
the three-time World Cup champions. Germany will begin defending
the European title when it travels to Turkey for its first
qualifying match Oct. 10.
	   A loss in Turkey would definitely remove Vogts, if he is still
around even by then.
	   An opinion poll conducted for the RTL television station Monday
said 72 percent of the Germans wanted Vogts to go.
	   The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said a new beginning could
not succeed ``because the team has lost confidence in their
coach.''
	   The newspaper suggested Vogts should find the ``right time'' to
quit.
	   The Frankfurter Rundschau, another national newspaper, said
Vogts had become ``the symbol of the downfall of the national
team.''
	   Vogts became coach in 1990, after Germany won the world Cup
title in Italy.
	   Under his guidance, Germany lost in the final of the 1992
European Championship, was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the
1994 World Cup and won the European title two years ago in England,
Vogts' only success.

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland's new
multi-party administration is supposed to be appointed from a
108-seat legislative Assembly elected in June.
	   The administration, to be called the Executive, would require
majority support from both the Protestant and Catholic blocs in the
Assembly.
	   The Catholic and neutral parties all support April's peace
agreement that outlined the cross-community government. But
Protestant opinion is divided between the Ulster Unionists and
Progressive Unionists _ who form a pro-agreement bloc of 30 _ and
28 others who reject the agreement because it includes the
IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.

Taliban warns of regional strike; opponents seek aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The ruling Taliban army has warned
Iran that any military retaliation over 11 Iranian diplomats
missing in Afghanistan could quickly escalate into a conflict that
would turn the whole region into a ``fireball.''
	   Meantime, the minority northern-based opposition called Monday
for international support to help it recapture the country. In
Ankara, Turkey, ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani said the
Taliban ``have turned Afghanistan into a center of terrorism. Any
assistance to us would be assistance to world security.''
	   Afghanistan's powerful neighbor Iran has warned the Taliban that
it would take ``necessary measures'' to win the release of
Iranians. Iran accuses the Taliban of seizing 47 Iranians _
including 11 diplomats and a journalist _ last month. The Taliban
denies any knowledge of the diplomats, but released five other
Iranian prisoners in a goodwill gesture on Thursday.
	   Iran fears its diplomats were killed during or after an Aug. 8
Taliban attack on the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   On Sunday, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was
quoted as telling the English-language Tehran Times newspaper that
the country will not enter a military confrontation with the
Taliban.
	   However, about 70,000 Iranian troops, with tanks and warplanes,
exercised near the Afghan border last week, and remained in the
area.
	   Taliban army spokesman Wakil Ahmed Mutawakil said the Taliban
would spare nothing if Iran attacked.
	   ``It is therefore urgent that the world organizations take
appropriate action in this regard to prevent a huge conflict that
would destabilize the whole region,'' he said in a printed
statement issued late Sunday.
	   The Taliban's spokesman at the United Nations, Noorullah Zadran,
warned in an interview broadcast by the BBC that an Iran-Afghan
conflict ``would turn the entire region into a fireball'' and that
some of the deadliest weapons ever developed might be used.
	   Last month, the United States launched a missile strike against
suspected terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. Washington
believes the camps were run by Saudi billionaire dissident Osama
bin Laden, the man it blames for funding the bombing of two U.S.
embassies in eastern Africa.

Yeltsin lobbies Russian lawmakers to approve prime minister
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Yeltsin and parliament failing to reach agreement
on Chernomyrdin's candidacy in new grafs 4-8. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Planned &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia's economy floundering, President Boris
Yeltsin conferred with his parliamentary foes in the Kremlin and
urged them to support his candidate for prime minister in a key
vote Monday.
	   Russia has had an interim government for the past two weeks, and
acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has been struggling to
win confirmation from an opposition-dominated parliament, leaving
little time to devote to the economic crisis.
	   Russia's beleaguered markets received another jolt on Monday
when the ruble crashed again and Central Bank Chairman Sergei
Dubinin offered to resign.
	   Both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin met with the leaders of the
parliamentary factions at the Kremlin, but the Communists and their
allies insisted afterward they would again vote against
Chernomyrdin on Monday afternoon.
	   ``Our stance remains unchanged,'' Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov told reporters after consultations with Yeltsin.
	   ``He doesn't even understand the program he has proposed,''
Zyuganov said of Chernomyrdin.
	   However, Yeltsin defended Chernomyrdin's candidacy and said he
wouldn't nominate anyone else. Chernomyrdin held the post of
premier for five years before being dismissed in March.
	   The president suggested that the parliament confirm
Chernomyrdin, and then assess his performance after a ``trial
period'' of six to eight months.
	   Parliament overwhelmingly rejected Chernomyrdin a week ago, and
if they vote him down again on Monday, Yeltsin can either
renominate him or another candidate for a third vote, which would
take place in about a week's time.
	   If the Duma rejects the president's candidate on the third vote,
then the constitution calls for the president to dissolve the Duma
and call new elections within three months. Yeltsin would
effectively rule by decree during the interim.
	   Chernomyrdin, speaking on national television Sunday, warned
that further delay in forming a new government would exacerbate the
nation's economic woes to such a degree that extreme nationalist
forces might try to take advantage of the turmoil and seize power.
	   ``They will not spare anyone. That would be a tragedy and
catastrophe for Russia,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   He also stressed that Russia still wants aid and cooperation
from the West to help ease the economic crisis, which has seen the
ruble collapse and prices soar.
	   ``Russia is now enmeshed in the global financial system, and
this system doesn't want any collapse,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   Chernomyrdin pledged to avoid backtracking on free-market
reforms and retrenchment into Soviet-style economic isolation
predicted by some.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian Central Bank canceled hard currency
trading on Monday as traders wanted only to buy dollars, not to
sell them. However, currency exchange booths on the streets
remained open.
	   At the start of Monday's trading, the ruble was quoted at 20 to
the U.S. dollar, down from 17 to the dollar on Friday. Deals which
are to take effect on Tuesday pegged the rate as low as 30 rubles a
dollar.
	   The ruble was trading at just over six to the dollar when the
crisis erupted less than a month ago.

Dehaene is facing revolt within own party over EU voting rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene was
facing opposition within his own party Monday after the government
proposed to grant European Union citizens living in Belgium
municipal voting rights.
	   Eight Dutch speaking Christian Democrats legislators said Monday
any government plan should not be approved before it included
electoral guarantees for the minority Dutch-speakers in bilingual
Brussels.
	   Last Friday's government bill to grant municipal voting rights
to EU foreigners by 2000 was an important step in a long
legislative procedure.
	   The government plan now goes to parliament and it will need a
take in the constitution before the citizens of the 14 other
nations can vote in Belgium's municipal elections in two years
time.
	   Dehaene was able to push through the proposal after the
opposition French-speaking conservatives said they would back the
plan, making it easier to win the necessary two-thirds majority in
parliament.
	   Dehaene faced opposition closer to home Monday.
	   The eight legislators said they welcomed EU voting rights in
Brussels but demanded guaranteed representation of Dutch-speakers
in the regional government of the capital. Fear is widespread in
Dutch-speaking Flanders that EU foreigners will vote almost
exclusively for French-speaking parties.
	   Up to now, the constitution allows only Belgian nationals to
vote.
	   The plan also has provisions that could make it possible for
non-EU immigrants to vote in the 2006 elections.

Minister urges Arab League to press Iraq on missing Kuwaitis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALAH NASRAWI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Kuwait's defense minister on Monday urged
the Arab League to help determine the whereabouts of Kuwaitis and
other nationals missing since Iraq's 1990 invasion.
	   The minister, Sheik Salem Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah, arrived here
Sunday for discussions with the league's secretary-general, Esmat
Abdel-Meguid.
	   Kuwait has been trying since the end of the 1991 Gulf War to get
Baghdad to account for some 600 people _ including more than 500
Kuwaitis _ believed held by Iraq. The war ended Iraq's seven-month
occupation of Kuwait.
	   ``Kuwait does not know anything about the fate of the prisoners,
or if they are dead, and it wants information,'' Sheik Salem told
reporters after a meeting Monday with Abdel-Meguid.
	   Abdel-Meguid said the league would step up efforts ``to resolve
this humanitarian issue.''
	   In February, Abdel-Meguid secured the release of three Kuwaitis
during a visit to Baghdad for talks with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein. Iraq said at the time that one had been convicted of
murder and two had crossed the border illegally into Iraq.
	   Before leaving Kuwait, Sheik Salem said that among the prisoners
in Iraq was a Saudi pilot whose jet was shot down during the Gulf
War. He claimed Baghdad admitted to this during talks mediated by
the International Committee of the Red Cross.
	   The ICRC, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, has been
negotiating to try to gain access to Iraqi jails in the search for
missing Kuwaitis.
	   Iraq has said repeatedly that it holds no Kuwaiti prisoners and
has accused Kuwait of keeping the issue alive to try to maintain
punishing U.N. trade sanctions on Iraq. The U.N. Security Council
imposed the sanctions after the 1990 invasion.
	   Alaa al-Ani, Iraq's director of information, denied again Monday
that Iraq was holding any prisoners of war.
	   He also questioned why Sheik Salem had brought up the case of a
Saudi pilot.
	   ``Why does al-Sabah speak on behalf of Saudi Arabia, which has
its own officials and special government organs which can speak
with what they have in mind?'' he asked.
	   In recent months, Iraq has accused Kuwait of holding some 1,000
Iraqis since the Gulf War.
	   Iraq has asked the Arab League to discuss the alleged
``disappearance'' of its citizens at a meeting of foreign minister
next week.
	   Sheik Salem said Baghdad's allegation appeared aimed at drawing
attention away from Kuwait's repeated demands for the return of its
citizens.

Nuclear workers go on strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Workers at a Russian nuclear research center in
the South Urals went on strike Monday to demand unpaid wages, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   ``Conditions indeed have become intolerable and socially
dangerous,'' said Vladimir Gorshkov, deputy union leader at the
Russian Federal Nuclear Center.
	   Gorshkov said workers have not been paid for five months and
that some employees have been laid off. He said the government owes
240 million rubles (dlrs 11.65 million).
	   The center, one of Russia's two major nuclear weapons research
institutes, is located in the Ural Mountains town of Snezhinsk,
which was known as Chelyabinsk-70 in Soviet times.

Pakistani government lawyer shot dead in Karachi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen Monday shot and
killed a Pakistani government lawyer who was prosecuting members of
a militant sect for the alleged murder of two Iranian engineers,
Karachi police said.
	   Police said the gunmen opened fire with automatic weapons on
Sardar Khan, 50, outside a school in Gulshan-e-Iqbal area of
eastern Karachi in southern Pakistan. He had gone to the school to
drop off his children.
	   No group has claimed responsibility, but police said members of
the sect could have been involved.
	   Khan was prosecuting seven militants of a Sunni Muslim sect in a
special anti-terror court on charges of killing two Iranian
engineers in Karachi in February. His family said he had repeatedly
received death threats in recent weeks.
	   More than 750 people have been killed in Karachi's political,
religious and ethnic violence so far this year, compared to roughly
500 in 1997.
	   Sunni and Shiite Muslim extremist groups routinely murder each
others members in a bloody conflict that has intensified in recent
years.
	   Sunni groups blames Iran for helping the Shiite extremists,
while Shiite groups accuse Saudi Arabia of funding Sunni militant
organizations. Both countries deny the allegations.
	   The Shiite are a minority of about 15 percent of Sunni-dominated
Pakistan's population.

Ex-Rwandan governor says he could not stop genocide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A former Rwandan governor, defending
himself against genocide charges before a U.N. tribunal, Monday
said he alone could not stop the bloodbath that washed over his
country in 1994.
	   ``There was nothing at all at our disposal to bring calm to the
place,'' said Clement Kayishema, the last witness in his trial on
25 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity and murder.
	   Kayishema is on trial before the International Criminal Tribunal
for Rwanda with businessman Obed Ruzindana, who also has pleaded
innocent. Prosecutors were expect to begin their cross-examinations
of the two men on Wednesday, the private news agency Hirondelle
reported.
	   More than 500,000 Rwandans, mostly minority Tutsis, were killed
in a 90-day genocide meticulously planned by Hutu extremists that
began April 7, 1994, the day after President Juvenal Habyarimana's
plane was shot down by unidentified assailants.
	   As the killings got underway, Tutsis began to flee their homes
in Kibuye, a district on Lake Kivu, west of the capital Kigali.
	   Kayishema, a Hutu, is accused of masterminding a policy of
encouraging frightened Tutsis to take shelter in churches and a
stadium on the pretext of offering them protection.
	   Between April 7 and 17, 1994, tens of thousands of Tutsis from
all over Kibuye gathered in these supposed havens. Prosecutors said
Kayishema then launched a series of brutal attacks against Tutsi
men, women and children, killing thousands at four sites.
	   Kayishema, denying the allegations, told the court that he had
no resources to restore calm.
	   But the prosecution has pointed out that he was chief of the
district, and had 200 military police under his control _ many of
whom were involved in the slaughter.
	   The killing stopped only when Tutsi rebels ousted the Hutu
government in July 1994.
	   Kibuye prefecture ``has the appalling distinction of being the
location of the most comprehensive genocide in the whole of
Rwanda,'' according to African Rights, a London-based group
dedicated to protecting human rights.
	   From a pre-genocide population of 252,000 Tutsis, the highest
concentration in the country, there were only 7,000 to 8,000 Tutsis
left alive in Kibuye by the end of June 1994, African Rights said.
	   The tribunal, beset by mismanagement and corruption since it was
founded in November 1994, issued its first judgment of genocide and
its first sentence for genocide last week.

After grenade attack, Hun Sen orders arrests, end to protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with one hurt by police firing, Sam Rainsy
saying he is under U.N. protection,
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Accusing the political opposition of
launching a grenade attack against his house Monday, strongman Hun
Sen ordered an end to weeks of protest against his rule and said
his most bitter opponent would be arrested.
	   One man was badly hurt when military police fired hundreds of
shots into the air to disperse about 600 people gathered Monday
evening outside the luxury hotel where politician Sam Rainsy, the
main target of Hun Sen's crackdown, was taking refuge.
	   Earlier, uncowed by Hun Sen's threats, his supporters
demonstrated by chanting his name over and over.
	   About 30 military police arrived and began pushing people around
before shooting for three or four minutes.
	   Earlier, policemen guarding the hotel _ apparently to prevent
Sam Rainsy's escape _ fired warning shots at cars from the
embassies of Canada and Singapore as their diplomats were leaving
after meeting the opposition leader. No one was hurt and the cars
proceeded without any damage.
	   It was not clear why officers fired the eight to 10 shots in
front of the Cambodiana hotel, but the incident indicated how high
tensions were running.
	   Through a spokesman, Sam Rainsy said he was under the protection
of the United Nations, whose senior representative in Cambodia was
at the hotel. His claim of U.N. protection could not immediately be
confirmed.
	   The events posed the prospect of a violent end to the
confrontation between Hun Sen and the opposition leaders, Prince
Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, since disputed parliamentary
elections July 26.
	   At a news conference, Hun Sen rejected speculation that he had
staged the grenade attack to crack down on opponents. He has a
reputation for political dirty tricks.
	   Police said no one was hurt when two grenades were thrown from
one or two passing motorcycles over the gates of his residence in
the capital. The only damage appeared to be a shattered window.
	   Hun Sen told reporters that family members, including his
father, were not home at the time. Hun Sen seldom stays at the
residence, preferring his fortress-like compound outside the
capital.
	   ``The arrests are to start from this hour,'' Hun Sen told
reporters. ``How many people will be arrested is up to prosecutors
to decide. We urge the people who are to be arrested not to
resist.''
	   Hun Sen said there was ``already a request'' for the immediate
arrest of Sam Rainsy, the chief leader of round-the-clock anti-Hun
Sen protests entering their third week. He branded Sam Rainsy a
``terrorist.''
	   Ranariddh, whom Hun Sen deposed as co-prime minister in a bloody
coup last year, could also be arrested, Hun Sen said.
	   Sam Rainsy's party said it had no information about the grenade
attack.
	   ``The regime is using every pretext it can find to justify the
illegal and anti-democratic actions it seems to be preparing to
take against the peaceful political opposition,'' it said in a
written statement.
	   Hun Sen warned embassies against granting the suspects refuge
and said they would not be allowed to leave the country.
	   Protesters were given until midnight to pack up their tents,
mats and cooking gear and clear out from the park opposite the
National Assembly they call ``Democracy Square.'' The same warning
had been given to Sam Rainsy's supporters outside the Cambodiana
hotel.
	   ``We have to return public and social order to the citizens of
Phnom Penh,'' Hun Sen said.
	   Police patrolled in force around the park, but there was no
immediate move against the crowd.
	   Sam Rainsy's party said any arrest of Sam Rainsy would violate
an agreement Hun Sen had with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   The agreement allows opposition leaders who fled Cambodia in the
wake of last year's coup to return to freely contest the elections.
	   The attack underscored the failure of three days of talks
mediated by King Norodom Sihanouk to find a settlement between Hun
Sen's party and the opposition over the outcome of the elections.
	   The opposition contends Hun Sen, who has dominated Cambodian
politics since 1985, won the elections by fraud. It has threatened
to deny him the needed two-thirds majority to form a new
government. On his own, Hun Sen controls only 64 of the 122 seats.
	   On March 30, 1997, four grenades were hurled into a protest led
by Sam Rainsy at the same park. At least 16 people were killed and
more than 100 wounded, including Sam Rainsy. The attack was widely
blamed on Hun Sen. He has denied responsibility.
	   Two weeks ago, a grenade was hurled at the headquarters of the
National Election Commission, where Sam Rainsy was protesting the
elections. One person died.
	   No one has ever been arrested or prosecuted.

Muslims groups accuse Taliban of persecuting Shiites
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Shiite Muslim groups on Monday accused the
Taliban militia of killing hundreds of Shiites in Afghanistan and
persecuting those who survived.
	   The London-headquartered Al-Khoei Foundation and the World
Council for Imamiah Affairs said the Taliban was following a policy
of ``systematic persecution'' of civilians, especially the Hazara
Shiite minority, since the capture of the opposition stronghold of
Mazar-e-Sharif last month.
	   Earlier, the London-based Amnesty International called for
access to Mazar-e-Sharif, citing reports of mass killings by the
Taliban.
	   The Al-Khoei Foundation said in a fax to The Associated Press in
Cairo that it had received reports ``of the mass killing of
innocent men, women and children by Taliban militiamen,
particularly among the Hazara ethnic minority.''
	   The foundation was set up by Grand Ayatollah Abul Qassim
al-Khoei, who was the spiritual leader of the world's 200 million
Shiite Muslims until his death in Iraq in 1992.
	   In a similar statement, the World Council for Imamiah Affairs
expressed concern about ``the fate of millions of Hazaras in
Afghanistan.''
	   It denounced the Taliban for the alleged killing ``of thousands
of Hazaras'' and said the militia also had cut off food and other
supplies to their villages.
	   A Taliban diplomat last month denied that the militia
slaughtered civilians in Mazar-e-Sharif and said that journalists
would soon be allowed to visit to see for themselves.
	   ``It is just a propaganda that we indulged in human rights
violations or committed atrocities against minority ethnic
groups,'' Maulvi Saeed-ur-Rahman Haqqani, the Taliban's ambassador
to Pakistan, said.
	   The Taliban, like most Afghans, are ethnic Pashtuns. The
anti-Taliban northern alliance has mostly ethnic Tajiks, Uzbeks and
Hazaras in its ranks. The Taliban are Sunni Muslim, while the
alliance includes Muslims who adhere to the Shiite sect.
	   The foundation urged the world community ``to act immediately
and exhaust all diplomatic and economic pressure to stop the
further slaughter of innocent civilians.''
	   ``According to Islamic teachings, the killing of one innocent
person is equivalent to the massacre of mankind as a whole,'' it
said.

Tel Aviv, Gaza City forge special ties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ They both lie on the Mediterranean, just
45 miles (70 kilometers) from one another, but Tel Aviv and Gaza
City are worlds apart.
	   This is about to change.
	   The two municipalities will become sister cities, along with
Barcelona, Spain, and the new bond is to be sealed in a Sept. 24
signing ceremony in Spain.
	   ``This is a very important step for the relations between the
peoples in both cities and the Palestinian Authority and Israel,''
Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo said after meeting with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on Monday.
	   The people of Tel Aviv and Gaza City are separated not only by
travel restrictions _ special permits are needed for visits _ but
also by a cultural divide.
	   Tel Aviv, Israel's bustling commercial with 360,000 people, is
one of the most Westernized cities of the Middle East. Pubs are
open until the small hours, and the latest trends in fashion and
entertainment are quickly picked up.
	   Gaza City with its 500,000 people is expanding as quickly as Tel
Aviv, with skyscrapers crowding the center of town. However, as
part of Palestinian society, Gaza City residents are deeply
conservative. Most women wear headscarves in line with Islamic
tradition and there is little entertainment beyond a few fast food
restaurants.

	   President Boris Yeltsin nominated Chernomyrdin for the post two
weeks ago. A yes vote could ease the economic crisis; a no vote
could worsen it.
	   Chernomyrdin has already been rejected by the lower chamber
once. If he is rejected a second time, Yeltsin can renominate him
or propose another candidate.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's fuel stations will start selling unleaded
gasoline next month at a price cheaper than leaded gasoline, the
state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corp. said Monday.
	   The more environmentally friendly product will be available at
all 90 gasoline stations as of Oct. 1, according to a company
statement.
	   Leaded will be sold only at 21 of these stations catering to old
cars not designed to use unleaded, the statement said. The Kuwait
Petroleum Corp. owns the Kuwait National Petroleum Co. which runs
the country's refineries and gasoline stations.
	   Officials had said they wanted to promote the use of unleaded
fuel by selling it cheaper than leaded, at least when it is first
introduced. Unleaded gasoline will be priced at 40 fils (13 cents)
a liter, compared to 60 fils (19 cents) for leaded.
	   A senior National Petroleum Co. official, Bader al-Sumait, said
it has cost the company around 56 million dinars (dlrs 183 million)
to make the shift in the local market.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The introduction of the European currency
will have little impact on Jordan which maintains close trade ties
with Europe, an official said Monday.
	   The Euro, which is expected to be circulated next year, ``is
unlikely to bear any negative consequences on the Jordanian
economy,'' said Maher Wakid, a member of the Jordan Securities
Commission.
	   ``There could a future arrangement under which the new currency
could be used in all trade transactions with Europe,'' he told The
Associated Press.
	   The U.S. dollar is commonly used in commercial transactions even
inside the kingdom alongside the Jordanian dinar, which is worth
dlrs 1.400.
	   Besides the United States, Jordan maintains close trade ties
with Europe. The annual trade exchange with Europe is estimated at
dlrs 400 million, about 20 percent more than with the United
States.
	    &UR; ___
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Central Bank of Cyprus granted Monday
a license to DePfa Investment Bank Ltd., a subsidiary of Germany's
Deutsche Bau and Bodenbank AG, to operate on the east Mediterranean
island on an offshore basis.
	   The bank, which will have a capital base of dlrs 100 million,
will deal only in foreign currencies and do business exclusively
with other offshore companies and foreign residents of Cyprus, the
Central Bank said in a statement.
	   The licensing of DePfa Investment Bank raises to 33 the number
of offshore banks on the island. Five others maintain
representative offices.
	   Nearly 34,000 offshore companies are registered in Cyprus. More
than 1,000 of those maintain full-fledged offices.
	   The island's offshore sector, created by legislation in the mid
1970s, accounts for 4 percent of the gross domestic product, almost
on a par with agriculture.
	    &UR; ___
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ The Cyprus Stock Exchange all-share index
returned to negative territory Monday after a rise in share prices
on Friday bucked a five-day skid.
	   The index closed at 88.34 points, or a marginal .18 percent down
on Friday's close. All seven sub-indexes were down except for that
of investment companies, which moved higher by .02 percent.
	   Volume was a modest 1.1 million Cyprus pounds (dlrs 2.13
million).
	   The market, which trades in more than 50 securities and was
capitalized at 1.2 billion pounds (dlrs 2.32 billion) in July, has
appeared little affected by the recent turmoil in world markets,
largely because of its small size and the insignificant
participation of foreign capital.

Two Americans stabbed in downtown Budapest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Unidentified assailants stabbed and
seriously injured two American men in downtown Budapest early
Monday, police said.
	   Eyewitnesses said the assailants attacked the men after
apparently getting into an argument with them.
	   The incident occurred in Budapest's 7th district at 5:15 a.m.
When the Americans tried to flee, the Hungarians wrestled them to
the ground, kicked them repeatedly and stabbed them several times,
police said.
	   The victims _ one injured critically, the other seriously _ were
in stable condition after undergoing surgery at Peterffy Sandor
Hospital, officials said. A police statement gave their ages as 28
and 32 but did not identify them or give other details.
	   Police ordered a news blackout in the interest of the
investigation.

Boeing promises to improve after management shakeup
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: LEADS with Boeing comments about management shakeup
 &UR; AP Photos planned
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ The Boeing Co. had a bumpy landing
Monday at the biggest air show of the year, bluntly apologizing
about late airplane deliveries while promising its management
shakeup will improve the situation.
	   ``Where we have been too arrogant, too distracted or too
self-satisfied, we are going to be much more intense and much more
focused on things that really matter,'' Boeing president Harry
Stonecipher told a press conference at the Farnborough
International 98 show. ``I am speaking here of satisfying the
customer in every way.''
	   Stonecipher wound up fielding his first public questions about
the recent firing of Ron Woodard as president of Boeing's
Commercial Airplane Group. Woodard was replaced by Boeing executive
Alan Mulally, who was not at the air show because of what Boeing
called a prior personal commitment.
	   Woodard's management team simply didn't deliver, and ``we've let
down many commercial airplane customers,'' Stonecipher said.
	   ``That is not tolerable,'' Stonecipher added. ``That is not
acceptable.''
	   Stonecipher said Boeing had only itself to blame for its
problems, and he predicted executive bonuses would be lower as a
result.
	   Boeing's troubles have cost it some dlrs 3 billion.
	   ``We did this to ourselves,'' Stonecipher said. ``And we did it
to ourselves inside our factories.''
	   The Farnborough show is expected to yield billions of dollars of
new business for the world's top aerospace companies, but neither
of the two biggest players, Boeing and archrival Europe's Airbus
Industrie, had any immediate new deals to talk about on the opening
day.
	   Executives from both airplanemakers said they would announce
some deals later at the week-long show attracting some 1,200
companies.
	   Boeing used the opening of the show to take a few swipes at
Airbus, with vice president Bruce Dennis of the commercial airplane
group saying that aboard Airbus jets, ``passengers are sacrificing
comfort on long-haul flights.''
	   The Airbus chief executive, Noel Forgeard, told reporters that
his company remains intent on developing a new jumbo jet,
code-named the A3XX _ for which Boeing says there will be no
market.
	   Forgeard, however, pledged to someday break the monopoly Boeing
now holds on the jumbo jet business with its largest 747 models.
	   Airbus, the European airplane-making consortium from Britain,
France, Germany and Spain, recently sold its first-ever batch of
jets to British Airways and signing a big deal with US Airways.
	   Throughout the industry, companies are enjoying a bumper year,
with airlines filling their jets with passengers and busily
expanding their fleets.
	   However, analysts predict a sharp decline soon, made worse by
the Asian crisis.
	   Executives at Boeing have estimated that sales could drop off by
about 10 percent in 2000 _ but outside analysts predict that
industrywide sales will plunge by as much as 20 percent to 25
percent that year.
	   The downturn, analysts say, won't be as bad as the crisis in the
early 1990s, after the Gulf War and the last recession dried up
demand for air travel. Airlines then were seriously overextended
but this time have been less ambitious about expanding their
fleets, so the drop will be less painful, experts say.

Defector: North Korea has capability to put satellite in orbit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A North Korean scientist who defected
to South Korea in 1996 said in a published interview Monday that
the North was capable of launching a satellite into Earth orbit.
	   The interview followed the communist North's claim that it had
launched a ``scientific'' satellite into orbit last week. There has
been no official outside confirmation. U.S., Japanese and South
Korean officials previously had said the launching was a test
firing of a newly developed two-stage ballistic missile across
Japan.
	   ``North Korea has established a policy foundation concerning
rocket and satellite development since the mid-1970s with Soviet
technology,'' Chung Gap Yul said in the interview with the
newspaper JoongAng Ilbo.
	   ``The satellite launch this time is only a showing of that
capability,'' he said.
	   Chung, 47, defected to Seoul by way of Beijing while serving as
head of a sound research institute under the control of the North's
national science academy.
	   In the interview, Chung said he had worked on the North's rocket
development program in the early 1990s. The paper quoted South
Korean government officials as describing Chung as a scientist with
``the latest information about the North's missile technology.''
	   Chung said North Korea has been building its missile industry
under the direct control of leader Kim Jong Il. He identified the
top supervisor of the program as Suh Sang Wuk, a physicist who
serves as an adviser to the leader.
	   The defector said he had worked for several years at a secret
military base where North Korean engineers were trying to acquire
missile technology by analyzing missiles bought from the former
Soviet Union.
	   ``At that time, some missile technology developed by North
Korean scientists, including propulsion technology, was superior to
that of the Soviet Union,'' Chung said in the interview.
	   He said without elaboration that he believes North Korea shares
nuclear, missile and satellite technology with Russia.

Anwar associate implicated in sex scandal denies charges
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A crucial player in the sex
scandal that unseated Malaysia's deputy prime minister broke his
silence Monday to proclaim their innocence.
	   Businessman S. Nallakarruppan, popularly known as Nalla, has
been detained by police under the Internal Security Act for 36
days. He is alleged in a book to have set up sexual trysts for
Anwar Ibrahim, ousted last week as deputy and finance minister amid
the sexual misconduct charges.
	   In a statement issued by his attorney Monday, Nalla called the
``wild allegations'' against him and Anwar ``without any foundation
of truth.''
	   Last Thursday, the day after Anwar was sacked, police submitted
affidavits in court regarding Nalla's case. He is being detained
for illegally holding 125 rounds of ammunition at his house, a
charge that carries the death penalty.
	   The ammunition was reportedly uncovered during the police
investigation of the sexual misconduct allegations in a book
titled, ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Be PM.''
	   One of the affidavits detailed how Anwar ``groped and kissed''
women provided by Nalla, the director of four companies and Anwar's
tennis partner.
	   An affidavit submitted by Malaysia's police chief Rahim Noor
said Nalla was ``believed to have access to national secrets
through Anwar and he likely could leak these national secrets.''
	   The document also said Nalla's alleged activities with regard to
Anwar ``could expose the nation's leadership to evil influences
within the country and outside the country which could jeopardize
national security.''
	   Nalla vehemently denied having been given or passing any state
secrets.
	   ``I was never involved in any activities either alone or with
others that would have exposed or permitted (Anwar) to be used by
foreign elements for the purposes of destabilizing the national
security or interests of my country Malaysia,'' Nalla said.
	   He also said an unidentified driver in one affidavit who claims
Anwar sodomized him 15 times may have been a driver that Nalla had
fired.
	   ``He left bearing great animosity and hatred toward me,'' Nalla
said. ``If this is the driver referred to, I am not surprised that
he would have chosen to fabricate the allegations.''
	   Nalla also denied that he had made any statements to police
against Anwar and that he had set up any sexual trysts for the
minister.
	   ``Anwar has been unjustly wronged. The loss, harm and suffering
that have been perpetrated on a good and innocent man, his family
and the nation are great,'' Nalla said.
	   He said he regretted his unwitting role in the political
upheaval.
	   ``My fault, if it can be described as one, is that I played
tennis with a great man, a fact known to many and now exploited by
a few,'' he said.

EU sees potential in currency board system for Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Union said Monday the
creation of a currency board could help Russia out of its economic
crisis, but only if the financial and political situation in the
country was favorable.
	   ``A currency board would be an instrument, not a miracle
solution'' to Russia's problems, EU spokesman Patrick Child said.
	   ``It depends on the context of the financial markets and the
situation in Russia. The markets...need to have confidence that the
monetary arrangements in such a currency board are valid,'' he
said.
	   On Friday, Russia's acting prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
indirectly expressed support for a currency board system, which
involves pegging the country's money supply to a reserve currency.
	   He said he would favor only ``controlled emissions'' of money as
a means to bring Russia out of its economic crisis. ``We have to
link money supply strictly to the hard currency reserves,''
Chernomyrdin said.
	   The currency board system has been implemented by several
countries, including Argentina, Hong Kong, Bulgaria and Lithuania.
	   Last week, the EU executive Commission pledged support for
Russia but said no extra aid would be granted until Russia achieves
political stability and makes a commitment to genuine economic
reform.

Russian parliament to hold open ballot on prime minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, voted Monday to hold an open ballot on whether to confirm
Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister.
	   During open ballots, the chamber tends to vote according to
party lines, which increases the likelihood that Chernomyrdin will
be rejected. A closed vote permits deputies to defect from their
parties' positions, which increases the likelihood that
Chernomyrdin would be confirmed.
	   President Boris Yeltsin nominated Chernomyrdin for the post of
prime minister two weeks ago as the country's financial troubles
took a sharp downturn. A yes vote on Chernomyrdin is expected to
ease the economic crisis; a no vote could worsen it.
	   Chernomyrdin has already been rejected by the lower chamber
once. If he is rejected a second time, Yeltsin can renominate him
or propose another candidate.

National government moves in as Sydney water crisis continues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tourist who brought own water, grafs 9-10 &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo SYD102 &QL; 
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The federal government stepped in
Monday to try to minimize the negative impact of Sydney's water
contamination crisis, as senior officials reportedly warned that
the tap water in Australia's largest city won't be safe to drink
for up to six months.
	   Residents and visitors to Sydney have been told not to drink or
otherwise ingest tap water unless it has been boiled for at least
one minute because of contamination by the dangerous microscopic
organisms giardia and cryptosporidium.
	   Testing has shown contamination at wildly fluctuating levels,
and officially the boil water warnings will stay in place for most
of Sydney's 3.7 million residents until Sept. 19.
	   But The Sydney Morning Herald reported Monday that sources
within the utility Sydney Water conceded that water from Sydney's
main water source, the Warrangamba Dam, will remain suspect until
March next year.
	   Prime Minister John Howard, who said Monday the first family was
drinking boiled or bottled water at its Sydney Harbour home,
offered the New South Wales state government any scientific or
other assistance federal agencies could provide to solve the
crisis.
	   ``It's embarrassing but equally it's a public health development
that could overcome any major city in the world,'' Howard told
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
	   Tourism Minister Andrew Thomson called an emergency meeting of
industry leaders to formulate a strategy to combat the impact on
Sydney's international image.
	   ``This is the worst thing that has happened to Sydney's
reputation in living memory,'' Thomson said. ``It has to be fixed
soon. Otherwise there will be real damage inflicted in the long
term.''
	   Canadian tourist Morreen Prior agreed. Hearing of the crisis
before she left, she bought bottled water at home in Toronto and
was drinking it Monday in front of the Sydney Opera House.
	   ``The hotel told me not to drink the water. It's really
embarrassing for Sydney,'' she said.
	   In a front-page editorial Monday, The Sydney Morning Herald said
a safe supply of drinking water for the city can no longer be taken
for granted.
	   ``Two years before Sydney plays host to the world at the 2000
Olympics, there (is) confusion and loss of confidence in this most
basic amenity,'' the newspaper said.
	   ``People from other countries, considering whether to visit
Sydney for the Olympics, must be wondering what kind of a city they
are thinking of coming to.''
	   Outbreaks of giardia and cryptosporidium in the water were
reported in late July and again last week.
	   The Health Department has reported the level of cryptosporidium
found in water samples was 12 times higher than the levels reported
in an outbreak in Milwaukee in 1993, the worst such outbreak ever
recorded in the United States. The Milwaukee contamination
contributed to the deaths of about 100 people, many with immune
systems already weakened by AIDS or cancer.
	   Other testing periodically turns up minimal levels or no
parasites.
	   There has been no statistical increase in illness during the
Sydney outbreaks.
	   Giardia, normally spread through human or animal fecal matter,
can cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems.
Cryptosporidium causes flu-like symptoms and can kill people with
weak immune systems.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ European Union expansion and crisis in
Russia were the main subjects Monday during talks between Austrian
President Thomas Klestil and his Polish counterpart Aleksander
Kwasniewski.
	   Klestil, who holds the union's rotating presidency, praised
Poland's efforts to join the bloc and said he viewed EU expansion
as the priority during his six-month EU term.
	   Klestil, starting a two-day visit here, said the political and
economic crisis in Russia gave the process of European integration
a ``special dimension.'' Klestil stressed that Western leaders
hoped for a government in Moscow that would continue Russian market
reforms.
	   Kwasniewski said the situation in Russia could in the short term
negatively affect Poland's foreign trade and discourage foreign
investment in central Europe, but stressed that Russia had to find
a way out of its current difficulties alone.
	   ``Our task is to help find positive solutions instead of
shouting: Crisis!'' he said.
	   Despite concerns in Austria that EU expansion will unleash a
flow of cheap labor and cheap produce from central Europe, Klestil
stressed that his country will support efforts of all its neighbors
to join the union.
	   He indicated that Poland may be able to enter a fast track in
entry negotiations without waiting for the outcome of the EU's
thorough review aimed at checking whether Poland's laws meet EU
standards.
	   Poland and four other former communist nations _ Hungary, the
Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia _ as well as Cyprus, began
accession talks in March.
	   Klestil was accompanied by officials from his country's labor,
interior and foreign ministries as well as Austrian businessmen
seeking new opportunities in Poland.
	   The two presidents also watched the signing of a social security
agreement between the two countries, which will guarantee benefits
to Austrians working in Poland and Poles working in Austria.
	   The agreement also allows Poles who worked as slave laborers for
the Nazis in Austria to claim benefits for the time they worked
there.

Philippine president asks for new immigration law to fight
</HEADLINE>
terrorists &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said Monday
the country's 58-year-old immigration law needs to be updated to
create a more effective defense against international terrorists.
	   ``Terrorism has now become a major threat in the global arena,
and we must protect our citizens from the entry here of undesirable
aliens,'' Estrada said.
	   He urged immigration officials to submit a draft of an updated
immigration law, which he said he would certify as urgent in
Congress.
	   Estrada said the bureau needs to upgrade its computer system to
be able to process passports swiftly and identify potential
terrorists. The bureau also should simplify its organizational
setup, he said.
	   He said an improved bureau would also attract more investors to
the Philippines.
	   Estrada commended the bureau for stopping 235 foreigners without
proper documents and deporting 19 others, including three suspected
terrorists, during the first 60 days of his administration, which
began June 30.
	   Several international terrorists have entered the Philippines in
recent years, including suspects in the 1993 bombing of the World
Trade Center in New York and associates of Saudi millionaire and
suspected terrorist leader Osama bin Laden.
	   Foreign terrorists are also suspected of having trained local
extremists, including a Muslim rebel group, the Abu Sayyaf, which
has conducted bombings and kidnappings in the southern Philippines.
	   Early this month, a handwritten note threatening to bomb the
U.S. Embassy in Manila was found on board an airplane that arrived
in Kuwait from Dubai.
	   The note said the bombing would occur last Friday. In response,
the embassy closed its main visa section for two days. No bombs
exploded.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ernest Ametistov, a member of Russia's highest
court who defended democratic freedoms and spearheaded legal
reforms, died Monday, officials said. He was 64.
	   Ametistov, a member of Russia's Constitutional Court, died at
his country home near Moscow, court officials said. Ametistov's
wife Olga said he died of cancer, which he had battled for months.
	   Ametistov was born in Leningrad _ now St. Petersburg in 1934.
His father was later arrested and executed in Soviet dictator Josef
Stalin's purges.
	   In the late 1950s, Ametistov graduated from the Moscow State
University's law faculty and started working as editor for a state
publishing house. In the following years, he joined research
centers dealing with legal studies, specializing in international
law.
	   In the final years before the Soviet collapse, Ametistov joined
the Memorial human rights group, which supported democratic reforms
and publicized details of abuses carried out during the communist
era.
	   Ametistov was elected a judge of Russia's Constitutional Court
in October 1991 and was known for his persistent efforts to
streamline and liberalize the Soviet-era legal system.
	   In the fall of 1993, when most of the court judges sided with
parliament in its rebellion against President Boris Yeltsin,
Ametistov strongly backed Yeltsin.
	   Ametistov is survived by his mother Raisa, his wife and daughter
Olga. His funeral was planned for Wednesday.

World Cup stars among Serie A's largest foreign legion ever
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The Italian League is becoming less and less
Italian.
	   The biggest foreign legion in Serie A history, including six
players each from World Cup champion France and losing finalist
Brazil, is gearing up for the upcoming season.
	   Big names and new faces are considered essential to promoting
ticket sales and boosting subscription for pay-per-view matches.
Plus, of course, there's the matter of winning the league title and
overcoming other European powers in cup competitions.
	   Taking advantage of the liberalization of transfer rules,
Italian clubs have been fishing heavily abroad, though most
newcomers will have difficulty matching the production of two-time
FIFA player of the year Ronaldo or France's World Cup hero Zinedine
Zidane, who star for top title contenders Internazionale of Milan
and Juventus of Turin, respectively.
	   The presence of Ronaldo for the second consecutive season and
the acquisition of Italian veteran star Roberto Baggio helped Inter
garner nearly 60,000 season ticket sales, a record for the Milan
club.
	   When the 18-team league kicks off the season with games Saturday
and Sunday, 142 non-Italian players _ 20 more than the previous
year _ could be in uniform.
	   The total, already three times higher than 10 years ago, could
increase before the transfer deadline at the end of October.
	   The expensive transfer campaign has drawn some criticism,
including from Mario Pescante, president of the Italian Olympic
Committee.
	   ``This policy is going to put an end to the growth of young
Italian talent and as a result is going to have an impact on the
national squad,'' Pescante said in a recent interview with the
Corriere della Sera newspaper.
	   Italy was eliminated by France in the World Cup quarterfinals
this year and coach Cesare Maldini, who lost his job, predicted a
worse showing in 2002.
	   ``It is not by chance that we are missing top-class midfielders.
Fresh talent is missing because foreign players have taken over key
roles in Italian clubs,'' Maldini said.
	   Sticking to its nationalistic tradition, low-rated Piacenza is
the only team to rely on an all-Italian roster.
	   Some new imports, such as Lazio's Chilean striker Marcelo Salas
and Perugia's Japanese midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata, said on their
arrivals they were lured to Italy by the opportunity to perform on
a big soccer stage.
	   They forgot to mention the lure of rich contracts.
	   Lazio gave Salas 3.5 billion lire (dlrs 2.1 million) per year
through 2006 and a wide range of fringe benefits. That's in
addition to the dlrs 20 million Lazio paid Argentina's River Plate
to acquire the 24-year-old.
	   The Roman club, the first in Italy to sell shares on the Milan
stock market, was particulary active abroad this year, also adding
Spanish midfielder Ivan De la Pena, Fernando Couto and Sergio Paulo
Conceicao of Portugal, Yugoslavs Dejan Stankovic and Sinisa
Mihajlovic _ and Christian Vieri, an Italian who was playing for
Atletico Madrid.
	   Lazio has 10 foreigners on a roster of 24 players.
	   UEFA Cup holder Internazionale is, aptly, the most international
club. Its 16 non-Italians include Ronaldo and countryman Ze Elias,
Chilean veteran Ivan Zamorano, Nigerians Nwankwo Kanu and Taribo
West, Argentine midfielders Javier Zanetti and Diego Simeone and
six Frenchmen, led by Youri Djorkaeff.
	   Two other members of the World Cup winners _ Zidane and Didier
Deschamps _ play with defending league champion Juventus. France's
Lilian Thuram and Alain Boghossian are with AC Parma, which also
fields a slew of Argentines _ Hernan Crespo, Abel Balbo, Nestor
Sensini and Juan Sebastian Veron.
	   AC Milan, trying to restore its prestige following two
disastrous seasons, is betting on newly-signed German striker
Oliver Bierhoff, German 'keeper Jens Lehmann, Danish midfielder
Thomas Helveg and French defender Bruno N'Gotty.
	   AS Roma, while still trying to land French forward David
Trezeguet, already signed Argentine striker Javier Bartlet and
Russian midfielder Dmitri Alenitchev to team with Brazilian
internationals Aldair, Cafu and Paulo Sergio.
	   Fiorentina invested money to prevent the departures of
Argentina's Gabriel Batistuta and Brazil's Edmundo, giving the
Latin American scorers rich contract extensions.

UN agency launches computer program to prevent extinction of
</HEADLINE>
domestic animals

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Siberian cattle that tolerate temperatures of minus
60 degrees Celsius (-140 F), Mozambique pigs resistant to African
Swine Fever and Kazakhstan dromedary capable of producing
nourishing milk on little water or food.
	   These are a few of about 1,700 domestic animal species a U.N.
agency hopes to save from extinction through a new computer
program.
	   The Rome-based Food and Agriculture Agency launched Monday an
interactive database on the Internet -- also available on CD-ROM --
known as Domestic Animal Diversity Information System (DAD-IS). The
program is intended to help farmers and scientists around the world
exchange views on how to safeguard dwindling species or discover
where the genes of animals resistant to a particular disease or
adapted to a particular climate could be used.
	   Keith Hammond, senior officer in the FAO's Animal Genetic
Resources, said saving the animals was a ``cheap insurance,''
against a future change in what ``humans need or want.'' He said
scientific breakthroughs about nutritional needs, the outbreak of
new diseases or changes in climate could all prompt the need for
animal species currently at risk of extinction.
	   ``If we did nothing for the next 30 years, most (of the 1,700
species) would be lost,'' Hammond said. About 30 percent of the
world's domestic animal breeds risk extinction, he said, and they
are being lost at about one species per week.
	   According to the FAO, the livelihood of about 2 billion people
depends at least partly on domestic animals.
	   Hammond blamed the loss in animal genetic diversity in part on
the ``indiscriminate import and use'' of breeds that do well in
developed countries but that require large supplies of expensive
feed and need constant health checks. He said farmers tended to
favor these breeds and neglect native species, leaving them to
eventually die out.
	   The project's Internet site is www.fao.org/dad-is.

IMF official says Indonesia on track with IMF program
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A senior International Monetary Fund
official said Monday that Indonesia was ``on track'' with programs
aimed at overcoming its economic crisis, and was working on a new
agreement intended to help companies obtain new credit.
	   Hubert Neiss, IMF director for Asia and Pacific affairs, said
the main element of a letter of intent between Indonesia and the
fund, expected to be in place by Friday, would be a framework for
domestic debt restructuring for the resumption of bank loans to
corporations.
	   ``Corporations have to normalize relations with commercial banks
in order to get new credits and restart production,'' he said after
a meeting with senior Indonesian economic ministers.
	   He added that Indonesia must maintain a tight monetary policy
despite the pressure it exerts on the economy.
	   ``The economy is still in an adjustment period following the
shocks in balance of payments and the depreciation of the rupiah,''
Neiss said. ``Unfortunately, monetary policy has to remain tight
and that's a sacrifice the economy has to take.''
	   Another issue is the sharp rise in the price of rice and
possible measures to correct it, Neiss said.
	   He added that rice subsidies will be maintainer ``as long as
necessary,'' but must be confined only to the poor.
	   Despite government efforts, rice prices have risen sharply in
recent weeks. Combined with a lack of supply, this has to a threat
of malnutrition in some parts of the world's fourth most populous
nation.
	   Neiss, who is in Jakarta for a monthly review of Indonesia's
economic program, a prerequisite for the disbursement of IMF
credits, said the IMF is ``happy with the progress'' of the
country's economic reform.
	   He also expressed optimism that Indonesian companies will join
the government-sponsored debt restructuring plan agreed to in
Frankfurt in June.
	   ``It's a slow process, and we have to be patient,'' he said of
the plan.
	   He said the government will announce new tax policies to
expedite the corporate debt restructuring.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Libyan lawyer for two men accused in the
1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet said on Monday that he doubts their
trial under a U.S.-British proposal will be fair.
	   Last month, the United States and Britain said it would accept a
trial before Scottish judges under Scottish law in the Netherlands.
	   Defense attorney Ibrahim Legwell told Egyptian reporters in the
Libyan capital, Tripoli, that the trial by a tribunal consisting of
just Scottish judges ``raises possibilities of losing neutrality
and of achieving justice, which should be under the eyes of the
world community.''
	   He added: ``A trial like this is merely a process of shifting a
court from a Scottish town to a court in the suburbs of The Hague
in the Netherlands.''
	   Meanwhile, the Secretary-General of the Arab League Esmat Abdel
Meguid backed Libya's demand of guarantees before the suspects are
handed over.
	   ``These are legitimate demands and they reflect the flexible
Libyan position,'' Abdel Meguid told reporters after meeting with
U.S ambassador to Egypt, Daniel Kurtzer.
	   But Kurtzer said Libya should hand over the two suspects for
trial as stipulated in the U.S.- British proposal.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A Canadian navy ship heard undersea
signals Sunday from what could be the second flight recorder from
Swissair Flight 111, a spokesman said.
	   ``They've got a very good signal on the transponder that is
associated with the other flight recorder,'' said Capt. Robert
Frank. ``Whether or not it is together with the other flight
recorder remains to be determined.''
	   He was cautious because the transmitter on the so-called black
box can sometimes become detached, so that the signal may not
necessarily lead to the cockpit voice recorder itself.
	   Divers working in 190-foot (57-meter) waters recovered the
McDonnell-Douglas MD-11's flight data recorder on Sunday, in the
first major breakthrough for crash investigators trying to
determine why the MD-11 jetliner plunged into the sea off the coast
of the fishing village of Peggy's Cove Wednesday night, killing all

Philippine stocks rise sharply as foreign investors regain

interest &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing higher &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks rose sharply Monday
along with most other Asian markets, buoyed by hopes of a cut in
U.S. interest rates, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange index jumped 27.55
points, or 2.3 percent, to 1,186.93. On Friday, the index had
fallen 33.57 points to a six-year low.
	   Renewed interest in Asian stock markets by foreign fund managers
has been fueled by hopes of a cut in U.S. interest rates following
comments last Friday by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
	   Traders also attributed part of the rise in Manila stocks to
bargain hunting, with investors buying on valuation rather than
growth prospects.
	   ``With a threat of a rate cut in the U.S., Asian markets are
suddenly attractive again for investors, but possibly only for the
near term,'' said Noel Reyes, research head at Anscor Hagedorn
Securities Inc.
	   ``Unless the Fed does cut its rate, this rally won't be
sustainable,'' he said.
	   Erwin Balita, an analyst at Securities 2000 Inc., also believes
the Philippine market's gains will be short-lived since regional
developments continue to be an underlying concern among investors.
	   He said overall sentiment for Philippine companies remains
bleak, with the economy expected to slow, and possibly contract, in
the third quarter of the year.
	   The country's gross national product shrank 0.7 percent in the
second quarter, the first time the economy has contracted in five
years.
	   In currency trading, the peso strengthened against the U.S.
dollar, buoyed primarily by gains in the Japanese yen and hopes of
a cut in U.S. interest rates, dealers said.
	   The dollar averaged 43.350 pesos for the day, down from Friday's
43.489 pesos. It was last traded at 43.210 pesos.
	   Traders said comments by a Japanese government official on
possible yen support intervention caused banks to lower their offer
rates for the dollar.
	   Hopes of a cut in U.S. interest rates, meanwhile, helped buoy
the peso, as foreign funds are expected to be diverted into
regional financial markets.

Gypsies to send a wagon to the Holocaust Memorial Museum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's Gypsies will send a wagon
and several costumes to the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington
to symbolize the 200,000 Romanian Gypsies who died in World War II,
a lawmaker said Monday.
	   ``We believe that along with the Jews, the Gypsies deserve their
place in the museum,'' Madalin Voicu said by telephone. He is a
lawmaker in the Parliament's lower chamber who promotes Gypsies, or
Roma.
	   Almost 200,000 Roma perished in the war after they were
deported, they claim. Some 9,000 Roma survived, Voicu said. There
are no Romanian government figures available on how many Roma, Jews
or other persecuted groups died during World War II.
	   Half the Roma were deported by Romanian pro-Nazi dictator Ion
Antonescu to the Soviet Union concentration camp of Bug, in what is
today part of the Moldovan breakaway republic of Trans-Dniester.
	   The rest were deported from Transylvania by Hungarian fascists
to Nazi concentration camps. Transylvania reverted to Hungary
during World War II.
	   Over the weekend, Voicu attended a meeting focusing on Roma
issues in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu, 225 kilometers (140
miles) northwest of Bucharest. Roma discussed compensation and land
rights for the families of those who suffered during the Holocaust.
	   The families of the victims have already asked for compensation
from Germany and the Romanian government.
	   Voicu said the wagon and 12 brightly colored costumes will be
sent to the museum at the beginning of October.
	   Romania has officially 400,000 Roma, but the actual total is
believed to exceed a million. Many say they hide their race because
of discrimination and prejudices, which are widespread.

Thousands gather to protest changes in Ivory Coast constitution

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Thousands of singing, chanting
opposition supporters marched Monday to protest recent changes to
the constitution that give the president sweeping powers.
	   About 10,000 demonstrators were marching slowly from the edge of
downtown Abidjan, the Ivory Coast's commercial capital. Every few
minutes, they would sit down on the highway, only to begin again.
	   A few dozen police in riot gear watched the marchers go past,
but there were no reports of violence.
	   A few people, however, carried signs saying a civil war could be
coming and accusing President Henri Konan Bedie of helping members
of his Baoule tribe at the expense of other Ivorian ethnicities.
	   But Laurent Gbagbo, a rally organizer and head of the opposition
Ivorian Popular Front, downplayed the possibility of violence,
saying: ``It's a warning of civil war.''
	   Widespread internal violence would be a first for Ivory Coast,
which is one of the few West African countries that has suffered
through neither a civil war or a coup.
	   Eventually, the group was to reach a rallying point a few
kilometers away where opposition leaders were to address the crowd.
	   The march went ahead despite government efforts to have it
rescheduled to a weekend.
	   ``Demonstrate, but don't destroy anything,'' Interior Minister
Emile Constant Bombet said in Monday's Le Jour newspaper,
addressing march organizers.
	   Government changes to the constitution, approved by parliament
at the end of June, have infuriated opposition leaders, who have
accused President Henri Konan Bedie of wanting to spring a
``constitutional coup d'etat.''
	   Controversy centers on a new article of the constitution which
appears to give the president power to cancel national elections or
delay the announcement of election results.
	   But opposition has also focused on other amendments, which
include extending the presidential mandate from five to seven
years, creating a second chamber _ one-third of whose members would
be appointed by the president _ and altering majority voting rules.

talks
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new material, rebel arrivals; EDITS to conform
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Rebel leaders and the Congolese
government they are trying to unseat arrived Monday for peace
talks, but neither side appeared ready to budge from previous
stances.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila has refused to meet face-to-face
with rebels who now control a quarter of his vast mineral-rich
central African country.
	   The rebels, who were not included at two previous summits over
the past month, arrived Monday for the talks with Kabila, and the
presidents of Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Uganda and Rwanda.
	   ``We are ready to talk and we hope the leaders will listen to
us,'' said Arthur Zahidi Ngoma, the vice president of the rebel
Congolese Democratic Coalition, at the airport. ``There will be no
cease-fire before political negotiations and no cease-fire before
troops from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia leave.''
	   Congolese military official Francois Olenga said Kabila's
delegation will resist attempts to persuade them to meet with
rebels at this northwest Zimbabwe resort.
	   ``They are not rebels. They are invaders,'' he said.
	   Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia have sent troops to Congo to
support Kabila. Uganda and Rwanda are accused by Kabila of sending
troops to back the rebels.
	   Before the presidents began talks around noon, officials huddled
in numerous meetings seeking to devise a method that would allow
all the warring factions to discuss terms of a cease-fire and
withdrawal of all foreign troops.
	   They also discussed the establishment of a African peacekeeping
force, possibly to come under the control of the continent-wide
Organization of African Unity.
	   Such a force would enable foreign troops currently in the
conflict to withdraw, officials said.
	   ``This summit will bring a solution to the conflict,'' a
confident Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos said when he
arrived at the summit site Monday morning.
	   It appeared Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, the neutral
chairman of the summit called by President Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe, might have to shuttle between the two sides in an effort
to forge an agreement.
	   Ngoma heads the eight-person rebel delegation that also includes
former Congolese Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha.
	   Salim Ahmed Salim, the secretary-general of the Organization of
African Unity, said the aim of the talks was to reach a cease-fire
agreement that would insure the continuation of Kabila's government
but also bring about democratic reforms.
	   Kabila has been trying to suppress a rebel insurrection since
late July. When the rebels were marching on Kinshasa, the capital,
troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia intervened on behalf of
Kabila.
	   Kabila contends the rebels are sponsored by Rwanda and Uganda, a
charge the two countries deny, and has said he will not agree to a
cease-fire until all Rwandan and Ugandan troops withdraw from
Congo.
	   Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said a crucial part of the
discussion would be democratic reform in Congo. Hopes for free
elections rose when Kabila last year overthrew dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko, ending three decades of tyrannical rule.
	   Kabila has promised free elections, but he also has arrested
opposition activists and stirred up ethnic enmities.
	   In behind-the-scene discussions at last week's Nonaligned
Movement summit in Durban, South Africa, regional leaders
reportedly agreed in principle to withdraw troops to the border
regions, where they can monitor security.
	   Rwanda, Uganda and Angola claim that Congo harbors opponents to
their respective governments.
	   Officials say Kabila, as part of any agreement for a cease-fire,
also demands that the summit devise a method of registering rebels
and ways of ascertaining their nationality to make sure they are
Congolese.
	   George Charamba, Mugabe's spokesman, said the rebel delegation
was flown to Victoria Falls from Johannesburg on a chartered flight
paid for by Canadian mining magnate Robert Stewart, the South
African Press Association reported.

Report: Jewish settler population grew by 3.3 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Jewish settler population in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip grew by 3.3 percent _ from 163,881 to 169,339 _ in
the first six months of this year, a newspaper said Monday.
	   The increase was due equally to births and to Israelis moving to
the disputed lands where the Palestinians want to establish a
future state, the Haaretz daily said.
	   The newspaper cited yet-to-be-published figures by the Interior
Ministry. Ministry spokeswoman Tova Elinson was not immediately
available for comment.
	   Haaretz said that in 1997, the settler population grew by 8.8
percent, and by 3.3 percent in the first half of 1998.
	   At the end of June 1998, 163,161 settlers lived in the West Bank
and 6,166 in the Gaza Strip.
	   The continued expansion of Jewish settlements is a key point of
contention in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, and the United
States has urged Israel to freeze construction, to no avail.
	   Israel argues it needs to build to accommodate natural growth.
However, the Palestinians and Israeli peace activists note that the
construction goes far beyond that and that thousands of homes in
settlements still stand empty.
	   More than half the settlers live in nine large settlements.

EU expects Malta to re-apply for membership soon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Malta-Elections &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union Commission said
Monday it expected Malta to re-apply for EU membership following
the election victory of the Nationalist Party, which backs EU entry
for the Mediterranean island.
	   ``We wouldn't be surprised if we receive in the coming days a
request from Malta to acceed to the European Union,'' said EU
spokeswoman Lousewies van der Laan.
	   Election officials in Malta said Monday that final results of
the weekend polls showed the Nationalists with 51.8 percent of the
vote, to 46.9 for Labor. The remaining votes went to a tiny
environmentalist party.
	   Nationalist leader Eddie Fenech Adami, who pushed for EU
membership while he was premier from 1987-1996, told supporters
Monday that EU entry for Malta was top on his agenda.
	   Malta first applied for EU membership in 1990. In 1993, the EU
executive Commission presented a 30-page report assessing the
economic and political situation in Malta and outlining the reforms
it must carry out to join the EU.
	   But membership talks were halted in 1996, when the Labor Party
came to power and put the island's bid for EU entry on hold.
	   Van der Laan said it was unclear whether Malta will be on a
``fast'' or ``slow'' track for EU membership. ``It's too early to
say,'' she said, adding that this was ``not a question for the
Commission'' but for EU ministers.
	   Earlier this year the EU opened formal membership talks with
five countries from central and eastern Europe, and Cyprus.
	   The six - Cyprus, Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia
and Estonia are likely to join the EU in the next five to 10 years.
	   A second batch of candidates _ Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia,
Romania and Bulgaria _ is on a slower track to membership.

Myanmar military arrests 110 members of Suu Kyi's party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with arrests of opposition party members;
INCORPORATES BC-Myanmar-Arrests &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government has
arrested 110 members of opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's
political party, the party said Monday.
	   The arrests came as the junta apparently was able to tame
dissent by university students, who peacefully sat for examinations
Monday after protests last week.
	   In the first street demonstrations against military rule in
nearly two years, as many as 3,000 students protested last week
over a series of educational issues and also reportedly lent their
support for a call for the convening of Parliament. Police quickly
quashed the demonstrations.
	   The crackdown on Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy had
been expected after the party announced last month it would convene
the Parliament elected in 1990 but never seated.
	   The NLD said 50 elected members of Parliament were among the 110
party members detained in a wave of arrests that began Sunday.
	   The arrests so far were taking place mainly in provinces outside
of the capital, Yangon, and have included officials of the party's
organizing committees, and members of its youth and women's wings.
	   The NLD won 82 percent of the seats at stake in 1990's election,
but the military failed to honor a promise to hand over power to
the victors.
	   Suu Kyi, the 1991 Nobel Peace laureate who was under house
arrest from 1989-95, has been stepping up her campaign to bring
democracy to Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   For Monday's exams, truckloads of riot police guarded against
possible outbreaks of anti-government unrest as students were bused
from their dormitories to take the texts.
	   The military government, which tolerates little dissent, is
particularly sensitive to trouble now because of the pro-democracy
opposition's vow to convene Parliament sometime in September.
	   All universities and colleges in Yangon and the country's
second-biggest city, Mandalay, were closed indefinitely in December
1996 after student unrest.
	   Educational institutions in other parts of the country,
unaffected by the unrest, continued their classes and held their
1997 final examinations. They did not, however, reopen for the
following school year.
	   Some have been reopened within the last few months so students
could prepare for and take long-delayed exams.
	   But the students protesting last week said they had not been
allowed adequate time to prepare, and had demanded the exams be
postponed.
	   Myanmar has been ruled by the military in various guises since
1962.
	   Suu Kyi and the NLD set a deadline of Aug. 21 for the military
to convene the 1990 Parliament. When the deadline passed with no
action from the government, the party announced it would convene
Parliament on its own.
	   The military has warned that would be illegal and would result
in the arrests of NLD members and possibly revoking of the party's
legal status.
	   Past attempts by the NLD to hold meetings of its members have
been met with mass arrests by the government.
	   The military government has yet to confirm or comment on the
most recent spate of arrests.

Northern Russian governor requests food aid from Finland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ With an ailing economy hitting food
supplies in Russia, a governor in the northwestern part of the
country on Monday requested food aid from Finland, Finnish
officials said.
	   Gov. Yuri Yevdokimov, from the Murmansk province, called the
governor of Finnish Lapland Hannele Pokka, saying that supplies to
the region from central Russia had been cut off.
	   ``They need basic commodities such as meat, butter, sugar, salt
and food oil,'' said Maj Korgell-Haimi from the governor's office
in Rovaniemi, 830 kilometers (515 miles) north of Helsinki.
	   ``Nurseries, kindergartens, hospitals and old people's homes
have been hit the worst,'' Korgell-Haimi said.
	   The governor's office in Rovaniemi has requested the Finnish Red
Cross to help provide food aid to the Murmansk region on the Kola
Peninsula, which is a primary base for Russian nuclear submarines.
	   Officials in Murmansk had also been in touch with Norway and
Sweden over food aid, Korgell-Haimi said.
	   Last year, Finland earmarked 4 million markkaa (dlrs 770,000) in
humanitarian aid to Russians living near the Finnish border in
Karelia and on the Kola Peninsula.

British teen finding it tough on pro tour
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Seven weeks ago, 17-year-old amateur Justin Rose
was being hailed as the next Tiger Woods after his brilliant
performance at the British Open.
	   But since turning pro immediately after the Open, Rose has
missed the cut in five consecutive tournaments _ and now is in
danger of failing to qualify automatically for his tour card.
	   The British media went into a frenzy when Rose made an amazing
45-yard chip-in for a birdie on the last hole at Royal Birkdale in
July. He finished in a tie for fourth, two shots behind winner Mark
O'Meara.
	   It was the best finish by an amateur at the British Open since
1953. Rose missed out on a 69,875-pound (dlrs 114,595) pay day
because he played as an amateur.
	   He was swamped with offers from sponsors and feted by the
adoring media and fans. Even Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York,
weighed in, saying that Rose and Woods could become good friends.
	   Rose turned pro immediately and made his debut as a professional
on the European Tour at the Dutch Open four days later.
	   Rose will be in the media spotlight again on Thursday when the
British Masters starts at the Forest of Arden course in Coventry,
England, but for an all-together different reason.
	   The accolades have stopped pouring in and the money hasn't even
started to trickle in. Rose has played five tournaments, missed the
cut five times.
	   In the meantime he turned 18, a week after his debut at the
Dutch Open, and is learning the hard way about life as a pro.
	   Unless he wins at least 55,000 pounds (dlrs 90,000) in the next
two tournaments _ the British Masters and the German Masters _
he'll have to qualify for a tour card through the nine-round
qualifying school.
	   Success at either tournament could earn him enough money to jump
into the top 116 places on the European Tour moneylist and
guarantee an automatic card for next season.
	   But first he has to make the cut.
	   Rose described his 5-over 147 in the first two rounds at the
European Masters in Crans-Sur-Sierre last week as ``just a part of
golf.''
	   ``It's not pressure that's making me play like this _ I'm just
fighting my game a bit at the moment,'' Rose said after carding a
second-round 77 on Friday.
	   ``Every time I miss the cut it gets harder. I don't think it's
anything major. It's all to do with confidence. There's no real
reason why I'm playing so badly, but that's golf.''
	   However, Rose remains upbeat about his future, insisting that he
and his father had mapped out a three-year plan for his progress
onto the professional circuit and his decision to turn pro was made
before he started the British Open.
	   ``It's always been a three-year program,'' Ken Rose, Justin's
father, coach and business manager, was quoted as saying in
Monday's London Evening Standard.
	   ``Go to qualifying school, maybe he doesn't make it on the tour,
so then a year on the mini-tours, followed by a year on the
Challenger circuit. That was always the logic applied when he
turned pro,'' he said.
	   ``It's a wonderful feeling to have time on your side.''
	   Even Justin, obviously keen to enjoy the spoils of the game as
soon as possible, concedes he has plenty of time.
	   ``Ernie Els is regarded as young and he's 10 years older than
me,'' he said. ``Obviously I want to do it now, win quickly, which
is a natural feeling. But yes, if I'm realistic, five years down
the line I'll only be 23.''
	   ``I realized at the time that Birkdale was one of those weeks in
golf when everything goes your way, but I've experienced some lows
since then,'' Rose added.

Peace seekers invite Somali faction leaders for talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Somalis seeking peace said Monday they
would try to settle differences between the leaders of several of
their country's key warring factions at a meeting next month.
	   Similar efforts have consistently failed, and there was no
immediate response from the faction leaders on whether they would
attend.
	   Ibrahim Habeb Nur said participants at a four-day gathering of
hundreds of intellectuals, traditional leaders and local
politicians decided peace in Somalia would have to be built from
the grassroots level.
	   Their conference ended Monday in the central Somali town of
Belet Huen, about 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of the capital
Mogadishu.
	   Somalia has not had a central government since factions
conspired in 1991 to oust dictator Mohamed Siad Barre, then turned
on each other.
	   Nur said the talks next month would be aimed at bringing
together warring subclans within the Hawiye clan in order to set up
local governments in the central Hiran region.
	   ``Then we are going beyond that to call all the other Somali
people,'' Nur said.
	   Speaking to reporters in Mogadishu via VHF radio, Nur said among
those invited to next month's talks are Ali Mahdi Mohamed, who runs
the northern half of Somalia's capital, and Hussein Mohammed Aidid,
who controls southern Mogadishu.
	   Key subclan leader Hassan Osman Ali, known by his nickname Atto,
has also been invited, Nur said.
	   A national reconciliation conference, agreed to by 24 faction
leaders in talks in Cairo in December, has been postponed four
times, and is now slated to be held in January 1999.

Malaysian stocks surge on support from local investors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from ousted finance minister, closing
figures &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian shares resumed their
upward surge Monday with aggressive buying by local institutional
investors, some linked to the government.
	   A Kuala Lumpur-based trader said the government's investment
arm, Permodalan Nasional Bhd., the Employees Provident Fund and the
pilgrims' fund, Tabung Haji, were all seen actively purchasing
shares Monday morning.
	   At noon, the Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip stocks,
stood at 456.29 points, up 92.85 points, or 26 percent. It closed
at 445.06, up 23 percent.
	   Anwar Ibrahim, stripped of his post as finance minister last
week on sexual misconduct allegations, said Monday he welcomed the
market surge.
	   ``I don't rejoice in seeing the market or currency fall,'' said
Anwar, who for months defied Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
easy-credit economic policy.
	   ``It is well understood that the (government) institutions have
come in in a big way,'' Anwar added. ``I'm not precluding the right
of institutions to participate, but they should be free to decide
objectively to protect the interest of investors.''
	   Apart from the larger funds, speculative retail players were
also seen pushing up the index, traders said.
	   Last week, the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange announced
restrictions on stock transactions, which effectively banned
trading in its shares outside the country.
	   ``They're closing the door and manipulating the market
themselves,'' another Kuala Lumpur-based trader said.
	   While foreign investors are mostly sidelined by uncertainties,
local investment funds, corporations and stock market traders are
taking advantage of what they see as a domestic rally and perhaps
inevitable bull run.
	   Foreigners holding stocks here are uncertain about last week's
measures. The government imposed currency controls and decreed that
investors cannot take money out of Malaysia before September 1999.
	   In addition, the central bank's announcement Monday that
effective Sept. 16, it would cut the statutory reserve requirement
to 4 percent from 6 percent was seen as positive for the local
market. The move will effectively release billions of ringgit into
the financial system.
	   Although the liquidity is seen flowing back into more productive
sectors of the economy, traders said the overall additional
liquidity may find its way into the market.
	   ``This may spell good news for the market,'' one trader said,
speaking on the customary condition of anonymity.

Five men found shot to death, execution-style
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Five bodies of men aged 20 to 30 were
found fatally shot early Monday next to a car riddled with bullets
at a roadside in southwestern Poland, police said.
	   The bodies were in a thicket near a road south from the town of
Luban, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) east of the German border,
local police spokesman Dariusz Cieslinski said.
	   Police suspect the shootings were vengeance by a criminal gang.
	   Three previous execution-style shootings in the area this year
left six other victims dead, Cieslinski said.
	   Since Poland launched its transition from socialism to a free
market in 1990, it has seen an increase in organized crime dealing
with car thefts, alcohol smuggling, currency exchange and drug
trafficking.

Leading scientist says sheep may be infected with mad cow disease
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A top government adviser said Monday that research
into whether sheep have been infected with mad cow disease is
urgent.
	   Jeff Almond, chairman of the sheep subcommittee of the
government advisory group on the disease, known scientifically as
bovine spongiform encephalopathy, said there is a ``a distinct
possibility'' that sheep are infected.
	   ``It would be a national emergency,'' Almond said in a British
Broadcasting Corp. radio interview.
	   The government would face the dilemma of risking public heatlh
or ordering the slaughter of the 40-million strong national sheep
herd, and causing the collapse of the industry, he said.
	   The Ministry of Agriculture and the National Farmers' Union
insisted it is safe to eat lamb.
	   Scientists have known for two years that sheep could be infected
because they were fed the same suspect fed _ containing parts of
sheep _ that caused the disease in cattle. The suspect food is no
longer used.
	   The European Union banned British beef exports in March 1996
after Britain announced a possible link between BSE and the fatal
brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has killed 27 people in
Britain since 1995.
	   Since March 1996 hundreds of thousands of cattle have been
slaughtered and their carcasses destroyed under a program to
eradicate the disease from the national cattle herd, but only nine
sheep have been tested.
	   In a statement, the Ministry of Agriculture said there was
currently no evidence to justify a ban on lamb sales.
	   The National Farmers' Union said if mad cow disease was on the
increase in sheep it would have been immediately obvious, but no
cases had been detected.
	   ``We would welcome any research thought necessary to offer the
public further assurances as to the quality of British lamb,'' said
union president Ben Gill. ``Scaremongering helps no one.''

EU delegation to visit Moscow on Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Senior diplomats from Austria, Britain
and Germany plan to travel to Moscow on Wednesday as part of the
European Union's effort to respond to the political and economic
crisis in Russia.
	   The Austrian foreign ministry said the three members of the EU
``troika'' will confer with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Alexander Avdeyev.
	   The leader of the delegation will be the political director of
the Austrian foreign ministry, Peter Hohenfellner, since Austria
holds the rotating EU presidency.
	   During the EU foreign ministers' meeting in Salzburg, Austria,
Germany urged the EU to send a delegation to Moscow to discuss the
crisis in Russia, which has shaken world currency markets.
	   But the EU ministers opposed any immediate effort to bail out
the Russian economy, saying Sunday that stability will come to
Russia only after serious political reform, and only the Russians
themselves can achieve that.
	   The ministers called on Russia to ``proceed along the path of
structural reforms in order to establish a social market economy.''
	   Russia has had an interim government for the past two weeks, and
acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has been struggling to
muster support for his confirmation from an opposition-dominated
parliament, leaving little time to devote to the economic crisis.
	   In a related development, Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf
Edlinger announced he would visit Moscow for the EU as soon as the
State Duma or lower house of parliament approved a new government.
	   Edlinger's spokesman, Andreas Hoeferl, told the Austria Press
Agency the visit could take place on short notice once the Duma has
taken a decision.
	   The visit would be to review the overall economic situation and
explore ways to help the Russians recover.

Singapore's main index jumps by 7 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's stock exchange Monday posted a 7
percent recovery from Friday's close, joining other Asian markets
in a positive response to Japan's strengthening yen and market
gains in Malaysia.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Index closed at 862.10, up from the
opening level of 805.04. In one of best performances in years, the
stock market regained last week's losses and went back to the
levels of late August.
	   It was the bourse's first recovery in more than two months,
during which it has steadily fallen to new low levels, set off by
Japan's recession as well as currency and stock trading
restrictions in neighboring Malaysia.
	   The old benchmark, the Straits Times Industrial Index, jumped 14
percent in one day on Feb. 3 amid a brisk rally on the Singapore
exchange at the start of the year. The Straits Times Industrial
Index was replaced Aug. 31 by the Straits Times Index.

Ex-Rwandan governor says he could not stop genocide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS background on Rwanda trials, last two grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A former Rwandan governor, defending
himself against genocide charges before a U.N. tribunal, Monday
said he alone could not stop the bloodbath that washed over his
country in 1994.
	   ``There was nothing at all at our disposal to bring calm to the
place,'' said Clement Kayishema, the last witness in his trial on
25 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity and murder.
	   Kayishema is on trial before the International Criminal Tribunal
for Rwanda with businessman Obed Ruzindana, who also has pleaded
innocent. Prosecutors were expect to begin their cross-examinations
of the two men on Wednesday, the private news agency Hirondelle
reported.
	   More than 500,000 Rwandans, mostly minority Tutsis, were killed
in a 90-day genocide meticulously planned by Hutu extremists that
began April 7, 1994, the day after President Juvenal Habyarimana's
plane was shot down by unidentified assailants.
	   As the killings got underway, Tutsis began to flee their homes
in Kibuye, a district on Lake Kivu, west of the capital Kigali.
	   Kayishema, a Hutu, is accused of masterminding a policy of
encouraging frightened Tutsis to take shelter in churches and a
stadium on the pretext of offering them protection.
	   Between April 7 and 17, 1994, tens of thousands of Tutsis from
all over Kibuye gathered in these supposed havens. Prosecutors said
Kayishema then launched a series of brutal attacks against Tutsi
men, women and children, killing thousands at four sites.
	   Kayishema, denying the allegations, told the court that he had
no resources to restore calm.
	   But the prosecution has pointed out that he was chief of the
district, and had 200 military police under his control _ many of
whom were involved in the slaughter.
	   The killing stopped only when Tutsi rebels ousted the Hutu
government in July 1994.
	   Kibuye prefecture ``has the appalling distinction of being the
location of the most comprehensive genocide in the whole of
Rwanda,'' according to African Rights, a London-based group
dedicated to protecting human rights.
	   From a pre-genocide population of 252,000 Tutsis, the highest
concentration in the country, there were only 7,000 to 8,000 Tutsis
left alive in Kibuye by the end of June 1994, African Rights said.
	   The tribunal, beset by mismanagement and corruption since it was
founded in November 1994, issued its first judgment of genocide and
its first sentence for genocide last week.
	   Rwanda has carried out its own prosecutions. In April, Rwandan
firing squads executed 22 people convicted of genocide, the first
executions in connection with the genocide. At least 116 Rwandans
have been condemned to death in trials that began in December 1996.
	   Rwandan officials said at least 10,000 people have pleaded
guilty to genocide as part of a plea-bargain program designed to
relieve the burden on courts and prisons, which hold an estimated
130,000 suspects.

Slovenia decides not to fly to Montenegro
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ A Slovene airline has turned down
Montenegro's request that it continue flying to the tiny republic
after Yugoslavia banned the charter service from operating in the
country's airspace, an airline executive said Monday.
	   Montenegro, which with Serbia makes up present-day Yugoslavia,
called on Slovenia's Adria Airways to keep flying to Montenegro,
even though Yugoslavia last week banned the Slovene charter company
from its airspace.
	   The Federal Ministry of Communications, which issued the ban,
said it resulted from unresolved disputes between the two countries
following the 1991 disintegration of the former Yugoslav
federation. Slovenia had been part of the federation.
	   Montenegro's government said the ban was intolerable.
	   Adria Airways' commercial manager Bojan Sodik said his company
refused Montenegro's request to keep flying.
	   ``The airspace above Montenegro is Yugoslav airspace, controlled
by the Yugoslav army,'' Sodik said, evidently referring to company
fears that Yugoslavia might violently respond to a breach of its
ban.
	   This summer, the airline flew 30 charter flights to Podgorica
and Tivat in Montenegro, bringing about 5,000 tourists. It had no
flights to Serbia.
	   Montenegro's reformist government has repeatedly tried to
distance itself from the autocratic Belgrade regime, launching
numerous economic and political reforms intended to transform the
republic into a haven for tourists and entrepreneurs.
	   On Sunday, the European Union prohibited flights by the Yugoslav
national carrier JAT to EU cities as one of a series of sanctions
to get Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to stop his crackdown
on independence-minded Kosovo province and its overwhelmingly
ethnic Albanian population.
	   Montenegro Airlines manager Zoran Djurisic said last week his
carrier was ready to take over flights from JAT following
implementation of the EU ban.
	   The airline has only two planes, which operate domestically and
on charter flights to several European countries, including
Germany.

Dengue deaths in the Philippines rise to 202
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ At least 202 people have died in the
Philippines of dengue fever and more than 11,200 others have been
hospitalized with the disease in the first eight months of this
year, the Department of Health said Monday.
	   The department revised the toll after reports from rural areas
reached Manila, and said it did not reflect a major new upsurge in
the disease. Last month, it said 114 people had died and more than
7,750 were hospitalized because of dengue.
	   The National Epidemic Sentinel Surveillance System reported new
dengue fever ``hot spots'' in San Pablo City in Laguna province,
Legaspi City in Albay province, and Camarines Norte province, all
on the main island of Luzon.
	   In Manila, at least 32 deaths were reported while 2,151 people
were admitted to hospitals.
	   Dengue cases also were reported in Nueva Ecija and Cagayan
provinces in the north, Negros Occidental in the central
Philippines and Bukidnon province in the south.
	   Dengue fever, which is carried by daytime biting mosquitoes,
causes high fever, rash, nose bleeds and, in severe cases, shock
and internal bleeding. The disease can be fatal if not treated
early.
	   Dengue is endemic to the Philippines. A nationwide campaign that
includes emptying stagnant water from old tires, trash cans and
even flower pots began in August.

Turkish police seize unprocessed uranium, arrest eight people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Police seized 4.5 kilograms (10 pounds)
of unprocessed uranium Monday and arrested eight people alleged to
be part of a smuggling ring, police said.
	   Alerted by the nation's intelligence agency, undercover officers
posed as potential buyers and contacted two Kazakh nationals, an
Azerbaijani and five Turks. The group allegedly planned to sell the
uranium for dlrs 1 million.
	   The uranium was allegedly smuggled in from Russia. The seized
substance was been sent to a nuclear research laboratory for
examination.
	   It was not clear where the uranium might have wound up if the
undercover operation hadn't been arranged.
	   The eight were scheduled to appear in court later Monday.
	   It takes about 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of processed,
weapons-grade uranium to make a bomb, according to U.S. government
estimates. Other estimates say a crude bomb could be made with 16
kilograms (35 pounds) of weapons-grade uranium.

Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent warns of epidemics in
</HEADLINE>
Sudan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Tens of thousands of people who have been
made homeless by floods in northern and eastern Sudan face a
dangerous risk of epidemics, the International Federation of Red
Cross and Red Crescent societies said Monday.
	   ``Reports of deaths have begun to come in,'' said a statement by
the Geneva-based federation faxed to The Associated Press office in
Cairo.
	   ``There is a risk of epidemic disease. It could turn this into
an even greater disaster,'' the statement said. It gave no details.
	   It said more than 8,000 have lost their homes and possessions in
northeastern Sudan because of the floods that started a week ago
and have affected more than 70,000 people in Sudan, where a 15-year
civil war often has led to famine.
	   The floods have also destroyed about 20,000 homes, as wells as
schools, health centers, mosques, roads and bridges, it said.
	   ``The high level of the White Nile, Blue Nile, River Nile,
Atbara and other seasonal rivers _ coupled with heavy rainfall _
caused the flooding, and with the rainy season having just begun,
it is feared the emergency could continue for another three
months,'' the statement said.
	   It appealed to international donors to give dlrs 2 million to
help 95,000 of the most needy.
	   Last week, the Khartoum government issued a flood alert for
people living along the Nile, saying the upper reaches of the river
had risen to unprecedented levels.
	   It said more than 20 villages had been cut off by floods.

Art meets commerce in Venice

<TEXT>
	   VENICE,Italy (AP) _ The Venice Film Festival has long prided
itself on its artsy reputation. For more than half a century,
elegant Venice turned up her nose at the commercial crassness that
infects festivals like Cannes.
	   This year things are different. Art meets commerce here on the
Lido, and they are getting along just fine, thank you.
	   The festival's first-ever film and script market is just in its
third day and deals are definitely in the making. The folks
handling the German independent film ``Run, Lola, Run'' are getting
so many distribution offers they're having trouble keeping track.
	   ``The interest is really huge,'' Thorsten Schaumann, of Bavaria
Film International, which is handling the film, said Monday.
``We're collecting offers. It's a great position to be in.''
	   Movie people, of course, don't really need a formal market to do
business. Whenever, wherever they congregate, they do deals, be it
at poolside, power breakfast or party.
	   But a formal, organized, festival-sponsored marketplace can make
it a lot easier, especially for small, independent filmmakers.
	   ``The markets are very, very important to us,'' said Amy Kaufman
of the New York-based Good Machine International. ''It's very nice
for us to have an organized place.''
	   The Venice market has its own, well-appointed pavilion where
prnbaum said the Venice market wants to
build a reputation as an intimate forum that brings together people
interested in making and distributing quality _ read ''art'' _
films.
	   The American buyer presence is relatively small, with few major
studios represented. But industry insiders say this is no surprise.
When it comes to the movie business, Hollywood is the heavyweight;
the Americans sell a lot more than they buy.
	   ''The major Americans show up only when they have big films in
the festival,'' Sternbaum said.
	   She said 150 buyers, including 25 Americans, and 50 sellers are
registered at the market. The European presence is large _ no
surprise at one of Europe's premiere festivals. Japanese buyers,
however, are also making a strong showing, with 14 at the market,
Sternbaum said.
	   Participants are giving the market high marks so far. For one
thing, they say it's classier than Cannes.
	   ''People are here to do business. It's great,'' said Deborah
Lobban of the Canadian firm D.A.P. Film Industry Promotions.
	   An organized market in Venice was long overdue, many said.
	   Yoram Golan, of the Israel Film Promotion Fund, which has
several movies on offer, scoffs at the snooty idea that art is
separate from commerce when it comes to film.
	   ''Filmmaking is a very special art. To make a film takes an
enormous quantity of money. And a film is nothing without an
audience,'' he said. ''A film has to be sold in order to be seen.''

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The Canadian navy said Monday it is
confident that it has detected the signal from Swissair Flight
111's second black box, the cockpit voice recorder.
	   The signal was picked up by submarine HMCS Okanagan, navy
spokesman Sean Kelly said.
	   The potential good news came a day after divers found the
plane's other black box, the flight-data recorder, which was flown
to a laboratory in Ottawa to be examined.
	   If it's in good condition, it could provide more than 100 types
of technical data that could help explain why the jumbo jet crashed
late Wednesday, killing all 229 people aboard.
	   The cockpit voice recorder also could reveal vital clues _
notably other noises in the cockpit in addition to an already
available conversation between the pilots and air traffic
controllers.
	   Search coordinators had expected bad weather Monday, but said
conditions were good enough to allow divers back in the water to
look for the cockpit voice recorder and three pieces of wreckage
believed to be the plane's fuselage.
	   Though officials have declined to give an updated figure of how
many bodies have been recovered, they have indicated that most
remain in the sea. Recovery of the fuselage could lead to recovery
of many more bodies, officials said.

Indonesian police question former trade minister about alleged
</HEADLINE>
corruption &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with end of questioning, quotes, background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A former trade minister and longtime
associate of former President Suharto testified Monday about
alleged misuse of central bank funds, police said.
	   Last week, Mohamad ``Bob'' Hasan told government prosecutors
that he used Bank Indonesia funds earmarked for a bank he owns to
finance part of his paper industry, PT Kiani Kertas.
	   Col. I Made Mangku Pastika, chief of the detective section on
economic affairs at the national police headquarters, said Hasan
was interrogated as a suspect in the case.
	   ``But we have not yet decided whether we will arrest him,''
Pastika said.
	   He added that on Monday, police also questioned Prayogo
Pangesto, a commissioner of Andromeda Bank, which was partly owned
by Bambang Trihatmodjo, Suharto's second son.
	   Speaking after more than eight hours of questioning, Hasan
asserted his readiness to repay the liquidity assistance received
by his Bank Umum Nasional. He said he would do so before the
government's Sept. 21 deadline, or ``the government can seize Kiani
Kertas.'' He said the paper company is worth an estimated dlrs 1.5
billion.
	   The 67-year-old wood tycoon, once a golfing buddy of Suharto,
had expressed willingness earlier to hand over his wealth if the
assets of his closed bank were not sufficient.
	   He reiterated that the funds in question were used for
constructive and labor-intensive projects such as the pulp
industry.
	   Both Pastika and Hasan refused to disclose matters raised during
the questioning.
	   Authorities are investigating widespread allegations of
corruption by Suharto's clan and associates during his 32 years in
power. Critics say their monopolistic practices contributed to
Indonesia's worst economic turmoil since the 1960s.
	   Hasan's bank was one of three troubled banks closed by the
Indonesian government on Aug. 21 as part of reforms to the banking
system required by the International Monetary Fund. The IMF is
leading a multibillion-dollar aid package for Indonesia.
	   In another case, Sudwikatmono, a cousin of Suharto, said Monday
he has handed over some of his personal assets to the government to
cover 1 trillion rupiah (dlrs 92 million) worth of liquidity
assistance.
	   ``If they (his assets) aren't sufficient to cover the liquidity
funds, I am ready to give more,'' said Sudwikatmono, president
commissioner of bank Surya, which was closed in April.
	   President B.J. Habibie has promised to curb corruption in the
wake of the resignation of Suharto, who was forced out by riots,
student protests and the desertion of his political allies.
	   On Sunday, Suharto appeared on national television to deny
accusations that he siphoned off funds for his own use from five
charitable foundations that he controls.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of student protesters tore
down the gates of Parliament and threw plastic bottles at police
Monday during a demonstration against President B.J. Habibie.
	   Officers later corralled them in a parking lot on the grounds,
but the students vowed to stay outside the Parliament building
until their demands are met.
	   Chanting anti-government slogans, at least 2,000 students
gathered outside the green-domed building to demand that Habibie
quit because of his handling of Indonesia's economic crisis.
	   They also urged that former President Suharto be put on trial
for alleged misdeeds, including corruption and repression, during
his 32 years at the helm of the nation of 202 million people.
	   In a separate incident, thousands of people rampaged in a town
in Central Java province Monday, burning and looting nine
Chinese-owned shops as well as cars.
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis in 30 years and
Chinese people have been made into scapegoats for skyrocketing
inflation, food shortages and mass unemployment.
	   There has been a string of riots around Indonesia over the last
two weeks, including unrest in the northern province of Aceh that
was triggered by anti-military sentiment. Two people died.
	   Riots swept Jakarta in May, killing 1,200 people and helping to
oust Suharto.
	   At Parliament Monday, students ripped the gates off their
hinges, but hundreds of riot police blocked the demonstrators from
entering the grounds. Hours later, they let several hundred
students march into a parking lot on the Parliament grounds.
	   Police also closed off the main highway in front of the
building, where protesters milled, dressed in brightly colored
university jackets. There were students from as many as 40
universities in Jakarta.
	   With permission from the military, students occupied Parliament
in the days before Suharto quit in May, camping out and daubing the
walls with pro-democracy graffiti. Soldiers evicted them after
Suharto's resignation.
	   Habibie is implementing democratic reforms, and has scheduled
general elections next year. Although he is dismantling the legacy
of his autocratic predecessor, there is widespread discontent over
Indonesia's shattered economy.
	   Student demonstrators urged the government to lower the priced
of rice and other basic commodities, which have soared over the
past year. Unemployment is also high, and the economy is expected
to shrink by as much as 15 percent this year.
	   ``Habibie is no good because he can't lower the price of staple
foods,'' said protester Mito Parar. ``That's why we demand again
and again before the Parliament that Habibie step down.''
	   Student protests in recent weeks have lacked the intensity of
the near-daily rallies that helped oust Suharto.

FRANKFURT: federation (DFB).
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   The DFB will now have to to move fast to find a successor,
before Germany travels to Turkey for a European championship
qualifier Oct. 10.
	   Germany is the reigning European champion.
	   Vogts, 51, became coach in 1990, after Germany won the world Cup
title in Italy under Franz Beckenbauer. Vogts, a former
international defender, had served as Beckenbauer's assistant.
	   Under Vogts' guidance, Germany lost in the final of the 1992
European Championship, was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the
1994 World Cup and won the European title two years ago in England,
Vogts' only success.
	   But this summer's 3-0 loss against Croatia in the World Cup
quarterfinals in France renewed calls for his resignation.
	   But Vogts said he would stay to supervise Germany's rebuilding.
	   The team returned Sunday from a week in Malta, where it
practiced and played two exhibition games, a slim 2-1 win over
lowly Malta and a 1-1 come-from-behind draw with Romania.
	   The trip was supposed to mark a new beginning. But the tepid
performances only increased pressure on Vogts to step down.
	   ``Berti, how much longer?'' screamed a banner front-page
headline in the mass-circulation Bild newspaper.
	   Major newspapers united Monday in suggesting the only way out of
Germany's soccer crisis was for Vogts to resign.
	   Vogts invited eight rookies and recalled ``enfant terrible''
midfielder Stefan Effenberg after a four-year absence. But
Effenberg never lived up to expectations and the Germans were a
long way off from playing creative and attractive soccer.
	   Instead, Bild said, television viewers at home ``were tortured
with horrible soccer.''
	   Vogts lost another chunk of his fading authority when he was
forced to abandon his new system and revert to using a sweeper, or
libero, in the second halftime against Romania.
	   The German coach had attempted to introduce a more up-to-date
zone defense system, but the players failed to adapt to the new
roles and demanded a return to the old libero system.
	   ``Back to the stone age,'' commented the influential
Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
	   Germany has been using the libero system with two man markers,
or stoppers, for nearly 30 years, since the days of Franz
Beckenbauer. Vogts wanted to switch to the zone defense used by
most of the top teams but the change seemed beyond his players.
	   ``We could not adjust, we were completely confused,'' said
midfielder Mario Basler.
	   Germany's shortcomings were plainly visible even against Malta.
The Germans were helped by an own goal from Malta and won only on a
fortunate late goal. Past German teams would have easily scored a
half-dozen goals against Malta, which was routed 4-0 over the
weekend by Macedonia, itself no soccer giant.
	   An opinion poll conducted for the RTL television station Monday
said 72 percent of the Germans wanted Vogts to go.
	   The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said a new beginning could
not succeed ``because the team has lost confidence in their
coach.''
	   The newspaper suggested Vogts should find the ``right time'' to
quit.
	   The Frankfurter Rundschau, another national newspaper, said
Vogts had become ``the symbol of the downfall of the national
team.''

Saudi King Fahd chairs first Cabinet meeting in a month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi King Fahd chaired the weekly
Cabinet meeting Monday for the first time since undergoing
gallbladder surgery last month, the Saudi Press Agency reported.
	   Fahd, who is in his mid-70s, had his gallbladder removed on Aug.
12 at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital in the Saudi capital of
Riyadh.
	   The Saudi monarch has been admitted to hospital four times this
year, the last of which was on Aug. 23 when he underwent medical
check-ups.
	   Fahd's half-brother Crown Prince Abdullah handled the oil-rich
kingdom's day-to-day affairs while the king was in hospital.
	   Fahd's health has been the source of much speculation since he
suffered a stroke in November 1995 and temporarily handed over
power to Abdullah, who is known to be far less pro-American than
Fahd and critical of Washington's support for Israel.
	   Abdullah essentially remained in command following the stroke,
which left Fahd with short-term memory loss and the inability to
concentrate for any stretch of time. Since the stroke, Fahd has
used a cane or a wheelchair.
	   Fahd, who is the head of the world's largest oil-producing
nation, has suffered for years from diabetes and arthritis.
	   He was born in 1924 but the exact date is not known.

	   Ministry spokesman Alois Bach said none of the injuries were

	   It was unclear what caused the explosion at Amberg, where a tank

Questions grow louder about interior minister's condition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The condition of France's interior minister was a
cause for widening alarm Monday as the nation's top daily demanded
answers about the medical accident that landed him in a coma last
week.
	   Jean-Pierre Chevenement, a former defense minister and a key
figure in Prime Minister Jospin's leftist government, has been in a
coma since last Wednesday, when he suffered a heart attack due to
an allergic reaction to anesthesia.
	   Chevenement had entered the Val de Grace military hospital in
Paris, where the nation's top leaders are treated, for gallbladder
surgery.
	   But the 59-year-old minister suffered what was described as an
extremely rare reaction to a component in the anesthesia. It isn't
known whether he was tested for such an allergy ahead of time.
	   The hospital, which is run by the Defense Ministry, has been
tight-lipped about Chevenement's condition, issuing only a few
terse medical bulletins. In the last one, on Saturday, doctors said
it was ``still not possible to formulate a stable prognosis.'' A
day earlier, the minister was said to be making ``progressive
improvement.''
	   It is not known what kind of lasting damage, if any, Chevenement
may have suffered. He is said to be in a ``reactive coma,'' meaning
he responds to his name by blinking his eyes.
	   The nation's most respected daily, Le Monde, demanded in an
editorial Monday that the government address the issue with ``total
transparence.''
	   ``To remain vague, to shelter behind secrecy _ be it medical,
military or state _ is the surest way of letting rumor take over,''
the daily said.
	   It said the attitude of hospital officials had been inadequate,
``even if it is following the will of the family.''
	   According to the entourage of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, even
the prime minister feels that not enough information is coming out
of the hospital, the paper said.
	   ``We haven't been told anything about the procedures followed
with regard to this particular patient, in whose case ... one would
suppose that, even more than usual, all precautions would have been
taken to avoid an accident,'' Le Monde said.
	   ``When and how did the pre-anesthesia consultations take
place?''
	   As interior minister since 1997, Chevenement is in charge of the
nation's police and security forces. He is a key political ally of
Jospin.
	   He has, at times, been an outspoken critic of U.S. foreign
policy, especially during the Persian Gulf War, when he resigned as
defense minister to protest France's involvement in the U.S.-led
coalition against Iraq.
	   He has been temporarily replaced by France's deputy minister for
overseas territories, Jean-Jack Queyranne.
	   Parliament deputy Georges Sarre, a close ally of Chevenement,
called on Monday for patience and warned against believing rumors.
	   ``Every day that passes is a small victory for Jean-Pierre
Chevenement,'' Sarre said. ``We must arm ourselves with patience.''

Court backs German attempt to expel Turkish juvenile delinquent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A court gave new ammunition Monday to
city officials who want to deport a Turkish juvenile suspected of
more than 60 offenses.
	   The case _ the focus of much election-year attention _ has come
amid a growing clamor in Germany to crack down on foreigners who
commit crimes here.
	   The administrative court said that Munich was within its right
to refuse the 14-year-old a new residence permit because of serious
assault charges against the boy, identified only as Mehmet.
	   The city first ordered him and his family deported to Turkey in
April, citing his alleged offenses and saying the parents
endangered public safety by failing to raise their son properly.
	   Bavaria's state administrative court rejected that deportation
attempt Friday, saying the teen-ager was never convicted and that
the parents couldn't be punished for their son's wrongdoing.
	   But the boy's residence permit ran out on July 21 and city
officials refused to extend it, providing a new opportunity to
deport him.
	   Mehmet started getting in trouble at age 10, but children in
Germany cannot be prosecuted until age 14. This summer, after his
14th birthday, he was jailed pending a robbery charge.
	   The alleged robbery was No. 62 on a rap sheet that includes
offenses ranging from breaking someone's nose and assaulting a
counselor to snatching the hat off a schoolmate's head and
demanding money for its return.

Japan's first approved sex-change operation postponed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A medical school has postponed Japan's first
officially approved sex-change operation following reports
questioning its past surgery on a transsexual, news reports said
Monday.
	   Saitama Medical College, just north of Tokyo, originally had
planned to perform a sex-change operation on a 30-year-old woman on
Friday.
	   The decision to postpone the operation came after college
officials acknowledged that the college hospital had performed
surgery to remove the womb and ovaries from another woman, who
wanted a sex change, five years ago without obtaining approval from
its ethics committee, Japan's semi-government television network
NHK reported.
	   School officials said the 1993 operation was conducted as a
treatment for endometriosis and not aimed at a sex change, NHK
said.
	   But the school decided to postpone the upcoming operation while
reviewing and explaining the results of the 1993 operation to the
college's ethics committee and faculty, NHK said.
	   College officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   On Sunday, the national newspaper Yomiuri reported on its front
page that the 1993 case was virtually an unauthorized sex-change
operation.
	   It was only in May that the school's ethics committee gave
approval for the 30-year-old woman with transsexualism,
gender-identity disorder, to undergo a sex change.
	   The Japanese Society of Psychiatry and Neurology said last year
that sex-change operations should be permitted on the condition
that patients undergo psychoanalysis and hormone therapy afterward.

Fidel Castro says Cuba must ``defend and shrug off'' economic

crisis

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Cuban President Fidel Castro said Monday
that Cuba had to ``defend and shrug off the economic situation, the
No. 1 problem in the world''.
	   Castro stopped over in Brazil on his way back from a meeting of
non-aligned countries in South Africa. On the 12-hour stopover, he
spoke briefly to reporters, making an apparent reference to the
Monica Lewinsky scandal in the United States.
	   ``The United States is suffering a institutional crisis,''
Castro said. ``Cuba's current task is to defend and shrug off the
economic situation, the No. 1 problem in the world.''
	   During his visit, Castro spoke with Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso for five hours over dinner before leaving the
presidential palace in the early hours of Monday.
	   Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said the purpose of the
meeting was to exchange points of view on the world's economic
crisis and its effects on Latin America.
	   Without resting before he flew back to Havana at 0830 GMT, the
Cuban president met with Brazil's opposition party leader Luiz
Inacio da Silva in a hotel.
	   The meeting was also about the world economy, said Cristovam
Buarque, governor of Brasilia and member of Silva's party.

Philippine government, IMF agree on 1.5 percent GNP growth target
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with agreement on 4.1 percent growth target
for next year, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government and the
International Monetary Fund have agreed on a 1.5 percent economic
growth target this year, Philippine officials said Monday.
	   If the target for growth in its gross national product is
achieved, the Philippines would be one of the few countries in
Southeast Asia to avoid an economic contraction as a result of the
region's financial crisis.
	   For next year, the Philippines and the IMF agreed on a GNP
growth target of 4.1 percent, Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson
said.
	   GNP measures the total value of a nation's output of goods and
services, including the billions of dollars sent home each year by
Filipino workers overseas.
	   The Philippines posted a GNP growth rate of 0.6 percent in the
first half of 1998, a far cry from the year-earlier 5.4 percent.
	   The government blamed the slowdown on the effects of the
regional currency crisis and a severe drought early this year that
resulted in a 7.5 percent contraction in agricultural performance.
	   The new GNP growth target for this year is the third adjustment
made by the Philippine government. The initial target was between 3
and 4 percent. The worsening economic situation later compelled the
government to lower the growth target to between 2 and 3 percent.
	   For 1999, the government had earlier expected GNP to expand by
between 5 and 6 percent.
	   Of the country's chief economic indicators, only inflation
targets are on track, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said over
the weekend.
	   In a two-week review of the Philippine economy that ended
Monday, the IMF and Philippine government agreed on an inflation
target of 9.5 percent for this year, well within the projected
range of 9.25 to 9.75 percent.
	   Next Monday, the government is expected to announce whether it
plans to draw from a dlrs 1.37 billion standby credit made
available under a two-year precautionary program with the IMF
forged early this year. Under the program, the IMF and Philippine
government must agree on economic targets.
	   Government officials said the downscaling of the GNP growth
target won't have much impact on the government's fiscal position
this year. That convinced the IMF to endorse the Philippines'
projected 40 billion peso (dlrs 930 million) budget deficit for
this year.
	   National Treasurer Leonor Briones said the government's
projected budget deficit reflects a planned pump-priming program to
stimulate economic activity.
	   Although badly hobbled by the Asian financial crisis, the
Philippine economy is in better shape than many of its harder-hit
neighbors.

German soccer coach Berti Vogts steps down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES previous series, changes sourcing, adds quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German coach Berti Vogts, heavily
criticized after Germany's quarterfinal World Cup ouster and under
fire again following last week's two exhibition games, resigned
Monday.
	   Vogts quit after a telephone conversation with German soccer
federation (DFB) chief Egidius Braun, the DFB said in a statement.
	   ``Humanely, it hurts incredibly to carry out this separation.
But as DFB president, I had to realize that it had become
unavoidable,'' Braun said.
	   Vogts said he was quitting to preserve ``any remnants of dignity
left over for me.''
	   The DFB said it will try to find a successor as quickly as
possible.
	   Germany, the reigning champion, travels to Turkey for a European
championship qualifier Oct. 10.
	   Vogts, 51, became coach in 1990, after Germany won the world Cup
title in Italy under Franz Beckenbauer. Vogts, a former
international defender, had served as Beckenbauer's assistant.
	   Under Vogts' guidance, Germany lost in the final of the 1992
European Championship, was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the
1994 World Cup and won the European title two years ago in England,
Vogts' only success.
	   But this summer's 3-0 loss against Croatia in the World Cup
quarterfinals in France renewed calls for his resignation.
	   But Vogts said he would stay to supervise Germany's rebuilding.
	   The team returned Sunday from a week in Malta, where it
practiced and played two exhibition games, a slim 2-1 win over
lowly Malta and a 1-1 come-from-behind draw with Romania.
	   The trip was supposed to mark a new beginning. But the tepid
performances only increased pressure on Vogts to step down.
	   ``Berti, how much longer?'' screamed a banner front-page
headline in the mass-circulation Bild newspaper.
	   Major newspapers united Monday in suggesting the only way out of
Germany's soccer crisis was for Vogts to resign.
	   Vogts invited eight rookies and recalled ``enfant terrible''
midfielder Stefan Effenberg after a four-year absence. But
Effenberg never lived up to expectations and the Germans were a
long way off from playing creative and attractive soccer.
	   Instead, Bild said, television viewers at home ``were tortured
with horrible soccer.''
	   Vogts lost another chunk of his fading authority when he was
forced to abandon his new system and revert to using a sweeper, or
libero, in the second halftime against Romania.
	   The German coach had attempted to introduce a more up-to-date
zone defense system, but the players failed to adapt to the new
roles and demanded a return to the old libero system.
	   ``Back to the stone age,'' commented the influential
Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
	   Germany has been using the libero system with two man markers,
or stoppers, for nearly 30 years, since the days of Franz
Beckenbauer. Vogts wanted to switch to the zone defense used by
most of the top teams but the change seemed beyond his players.
	   ``We could not adjust, we were completely confused,'' said
midfielder Mario Basler.
	   Germany's shortcomings were plainly visible even against Malta.
The Germans were helped by an own goal from Malta and won only on a
fortunate late goal. Past German teams would have easily scored a
half-dozen goals against Malta, which was routed 4-0 over the
weekend by Macedonia, itself no soccer giant.
	   An opinion poll conducted for the RTL television station Monday
said 72 percent of the Germans wanted Vogts to go.
	   The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said a new beginning could
not succeed ``because the team has lost confidence in their
coach.''
	   The newspaper suggested Vogts should find the ``right time'' to
quit.
	   The Frankfurter Rundschau, another national newspaper, said
Vogts had become ``the symbol of the downfall of the national
team.''

Vietnam condemns mob killings in Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam has strongly condemned the murders
of three ethnic Vietnamese in Cambodia by mobs believed to have
been incited by racially charged rhetoric in the country's
political upheaval.
	   The Foreign Ministry attributed the deaths to ``extremists'' and
demanded that the Cambodian government take legal action against
them, the official Vietnam News Agency said Monday.
	   ``We strongly denounce these barbarous and racially
discriminatory acts which have affected the traditional friendship
between the people of Vietnam and Cambodia,'' a ministry spokesman
was quoted as saying Saturday.
	   Opposition politicians have been playing up anti-Vietnamese
sentiment in a post-election standoff with strongman Hun Sen, who
is seen by many Cambodians as being too pro-Vietnam.
	   Hatred of the ethnic minority boiled over into violence last
week when Cambodians attacked Vietnamese in the streets, accusing
them of being behind scores of recent deaths attributed to rice
wine laced with insecticide.
	   Some Cambodians believe putting insecticide in the homemade brew
increases its potency.
	   Many Cambodians view Vietnam, their country's historic enemy,
with hatred and suspicion. Vietnamese troops overthrew the
genocidal Khmer Rouge regime in 1979, but stayed for a decade and
imposed a harsh military occupation.

Slovakia sees increasing number of juvenile drug addicts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ A 12-year-old boy died Monday
morning after sampling heroin with his 11-year-old brother, police
said.
	   The two boys, who were not identified, received a sample of
heroin from a dealer. The younger boy was uninjured.
	   The boys were from Petrzalka, Bratislava's largest suburb, where
drug use is flourishing. Officials estimate 4,000 drug addicts are
among the 110,000 people living in this suburb of sprawling
communist-era apartment complexes.
	   Altogether, Slovakia has an estimated 40,000 drug addicts, most
of whom are juveniles.
	   During communist times, drugs use was uncommon. But with the
opening of borders in 1989, drugs started to flood into the
country. At first, Slovakia was primarily a transport route, but
usage has soared since 1991.
	   The drug of choice is heroin, and most users are male. Many
begin using the drug between the ages of 14 and 18.
	   ``When drugs first appear, the average age of heroin users is
low,'' said Lubomir Okruhlica, director of the Center for Drug
Addiction Treatment in Bratislava. ``It will rise as the current
drug users grow older. In 10 to 20 years, we will be on the same
level with the age levels of heroin users in the West.''

Man murdered, remains burned in Christmas barbecue, court hears
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Dismembered parts of a murdered
man's body were used to fuel a Christmas dinner barbecue attended
by those later charged with killing him, witness statements
presented Monday to an Australian court said.
	   Accused killer Paul McKee used parts of Brett Harrop's body to
fuel the barbecue about one day after he fatally shot him with a
pistol made from a pen, say the documents, presented in the
Melbourne Magistrate's Court.
	   The court has been told McKee bashed and shot Harrop on
Christmas Eve 1997 because he believed Harrop was blocking him from
seeing his son at Christmas.
	   McKee, 33, and his wife, Tracey, 34, who had been Harrop's de
facto wife, have each been charged with murder.
	   The court was told that after McKee killed Harrop, he and Tracey
McKee used an angle grinder and various hand tools to dismember
Harrop's corpse.
	   Police statements by a couple sharing a home with the McKees,
Shane Brown and his fiancee Kelly Milbourne, who have pleaded
guilty to being accessories to murder, were presented to the court
Monday.
	   In his statement, Brown said Paul McKee called him to the
barbecue to show him Harrop's body parts.
	   ``I could not believe that they could burn his body parts in a
barbecue whilst cooking our Christmas dinner on the hot plate,''
Brown told police.
	   Milbourne told police that McKee had shown her Harrop's head and
said he was considering keeping it as a ``trophy.''
	   Tracey McKee later bashed the head with a tomahawk, Milbourne
said.
	   Brown and Milbourne claimed that with the McKees, they had
disposed of the remaining body parts in a dam near Melbourne.
	   The case is at a preliminary stage. The McKees are not required
to enter a plea.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A treaty to ban land mines worldwide and
the creation of the first permanent war-crimes court were two of
the bright spots in a year that included new threats to
international peace, the U.N. chief said in his annual report
Tuesday.
	   Nuclear tests by India and Pakistan reminded the world that the
man-made menace of the Cold War is still very real. The collapse of
Asian economies showed that globally entwined growth has
life-threatening risks, the report said.
	   Humanitarian needs skyrocketed this year with drought in Sudan,
wars in Africa and tsunami in Papua New Guinea. Money to care for
the needy, however, is tighter than ever, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said.
	   He called on governments to reflect on how the United Nations
can better deal with these issues and targeted the General
Assembly's session in 2000 as the watershed for creating a new U.N.
	   ``The Millennium Assembly to be held in September 2000 affords a
unique opportunity for the world's leaders to look beyond their
pressing daily concerns and consider what kind of United Nations
they can envision and will support in the new century,'' Annan
wrote.
	   Key among Annan's concerns heading into the next century is
continued reform of the world body. He claimed success in scaling
back the vast U.N. bureaucracy, cutting jobs and consolidating
offices. Reform in other sectors of the United Nations, which must
be carried out by member states themselves, however, is far from
complete, his report said.
	   Another concern for the next millennium is the impact of
so-called ``globalized economies'' on the developing world _ a
phenomenon whose social implications are evident in the unrest that
has rocked Indonesia, where the Asian financial crisis hit hard.
	   ``There is a great deal of talk today about life in the global
village,'' Annan said. ``If that village is to be a truly desirable
place for all of us on this planet, it must be embedded in and
guided by broadly shared values and principals.''
	   Two of the great successes this year were the international
treaty to ban land mines, which is expected to go into effect next
year, and the establishment of the world's first permanent tribunal
to try genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
	   ``Its aim is to put an end to the global culture of impunity _
the culture in which it has been easier to bring someone to justice
for killing one person than for killing 100,000,'' Annan wrote.
	   With this progress in international law, however, came a
setback: For the first time in history, the number of civilian U.N.
workers killed this year surpassed the number of military personnel
_ evidence ``of a further erosion in the respect for humanitarian
principals in several countries,'' Annan said.
	   And as expected, money is still very much a problem. The United
Nations ran out of cash last week and began borrowing from the
peacekeeping fund, a senior U.N. official said. Washington still
hasn't paid its back dues _ an estimated dlrs 1.3 billion _ and
there's no indication when and if it will.

Twenty-ninth victim of Omagh car bombing buried

 &UR; With BC-Northern Ireland &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OMAGH, Northern Ireland (AP)_ The 29th victim of the worst
terrorist strike in the history of Northern Ireland's 30-year
conflict was buried Monday.
	   About 300 mourners crowded into St. Mary's Church in
Killyclogher, just outside Omagh, to pay tribute to Sean McGrath, a
retired businessman who died Saturday from injuries sustained in
the Aug. 15 car bomb, planted by Irish Republican Army dissidents.
	   McGrath's coffin was then placed in a horse-drawn carriage for
the short trip to a nearby cemetery, which took the funeral
procession past Market Street, where the bomb exploded.
	   McGrath, 61, lived in Omagh all his life and was born on Market
Street.
	   Medical officials said 29 of the more than 330 people wounded in
the blast remained hospitalized, including two young women in
critical condition.

Host Germany qualifies 13 boats for semis, Italy 9, USA 8
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Host Germany was the most successful
nation at the end of qualifying on Monday at the world rowing
championships, sending a total of 13 boats directly to the finals
or semifinals.
	   Germany, which won the overall title at the Olympic regatta
course, capturing four of the fourteen boat classes, qualified a
further eight boats on Monday, including its crews in both the men
and women's quadruple sculls, which advanced directly to the final.
	   Italy had the next most lucrative start to the championships,
sending nine boats straight to the finals and semis, while the
United States had eight crews move through.
	   The United States saw both its men's and women's eights qualify
for the final, the American women clocking the fastest time of both
heats in their event, crossing in 6:35.43. The Romanian women won
theirs in 6:35.90.
	   In the men's eights, Germany recorded the quickest time,
finishing in 5:54.05, while the Americans won their leg in 5:54.89.
	   Australia also had a successful start to its campaign with five
crews qualifying.
	   The coxless four Olympic gold medal winning crew of James
Tomkins, Drew Ginn, Michael McKay and Nicholas Green missed
selection for the coxless four this season, after illness kept them
out of Australian trials. As a result, the foursome are making an
unusual attempt at three different titles at the worlds, rowing
together in the coxed four, steered by Brett Hayman, then splitting
up to race in the coxed and coxless pairs.
	   The foursome won their coxed four heat in convincing fashion,
crossing in 6:28.24, five seconds quicker than the Italian crew, to
qualify directly for the final. The Czech quartet of Pavel Knob,
Dusan Businsky, Petr Blacha, Martin Potasek and Oldrich Hejdusek,
won their heat in 6:35.08.
	   The Danish Olympic champion lightweight coxless four of Thomas
Ebert, Thomas Poulsen, Eskild Ebbsen and Victor Feddersen made
their way to the semifinals. The foursome, the first crew ever
achieve a clean sweep of the three-event World Cup series two years
in a row, won their heat in 6:26.54.
	   The French foursome of Frederic Pinon, Yves Hoode, Laurent
Porchier and Xavier Dorfman were the most convincing of the
lightweight coxless four, blitzing across in 6:23.78. Spain and
Ireland were the other two crews to qualify.

Ex-Rwandan governor says he could not stop genocide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with appeal, graf 14. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A former Rwandan governor, defending
himself against genocide charges before a U.N. tribunal, Monday
said he alone could not stop the bloodbath that washed over his
country in 1994.
	   ``There was nothing at all at our disposal to bring calm to the
place,'' said Clement Kayishema, the last witness in his trial on
25 counts of genocide, crimes against humanity and murder.
	   Kayishema is on trial before the International Criminal Tribunal
for Rwanda with businessman Obed Ruzindana, who also has pleaded
innocent. Prosecutors were expect to begin their cross-examinations
of the two men on Wednesday, the private news agency Hirondelle
reported.
	   More than 500,000 Rwandans, mostly minority Tutsis, were killed
in a 90-day genocide meticulously planned by Hutu extremists that
began April 7, 1994, the day after President Juvenal Habyarimana's
plane was shot down by unidentified assailants.
	   As the killings got underway, Tutsis began to flee their homes
in Kibuye, a district on Lake Kivu, west of the capital Kigali.
	   Kayishema, a Hutu, is accused of masterminding a policy of
encouraging frightened Tutsis to take shelter in churches and a
stadium on the pretext of offering them protection.
	   Between April 7 and 17, 1994, tens of thousands of Tutsis from
all over Kibuye gathered in these supposed havens. Prosecutors said
Kayishema then launched a series of brutal attacks against Tutsi
men, women and children, killing thousands at four sites.
	   Kayishema, denying the allegations, told the court that he had
no resources to restore calm.
	   But the prosecution has pointed out that he was chief of the
district, and had 200 military police under his control _ many of
whom were involved in the slaughter.
	   The killing stopped only when Tutsi rebels ousted the Hutu
government in July 1994.
	   Kibuye prefecture ``has the appalling distinction of being the
location of the most comprehensive genocide in the whole of
Rwanda,'' according to African Rights, a London-based group
dedicated to protecting human rights.
	   From a pre-genocide population of 252,000 Tutsis, the highest
concentration in the country, there were only 7,000 to 8,000 Tutsis
left alive in Kibuye by the end of June 1994, African Rights said.
	   The tribunal, beset by mismanagement and corruption since it was
founded in November 1994, issued its first judgment of genocide and
its first sentence for genocide last week.
	   Jean Kambanda, Rwandan's ex-prime mininster, on Monday appealed
his life sentence, arguing he was not rewarded for providing the
prosecution with evidence against other alleged ringleaders.

	   THOHOYANDOU, South Africa (AP) _ Nearly 600 people, mostly
women, were killed as suspected witches since 1990 in South
Africa's Northern Province, officials on Monday told a conference
on violence related to witchcraft.
	   ``Individuals are taking the law into their own hands in the
name of justice,'' said Premier Ngoako Ramathlodi. ``Our people
have resorted to violent and criminal actions in dealing with those
they believe to be witches.''
	   The premier attributed the increasing numbers of such killings
to fear and jealousy, the South African Press Association reported.
	   Elderly women were often singled out because they are unable to
defend themselves, said traditional healer Credo Mutwa. He said the
killings represented a conspiracy to destroy ``the feminine side of
Africa.''
	   Mutwa said traditional African beliefs have only sanctioned
driving women suspected of being witches out of a community, not
hunting them down and killing them.
	   ``Ritual murder as we know it today is not traditional to any
tribe in Southern Africa,'' Mutwa said.
	   -----
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Trying to cut down on food imports,
President Charles Taylor warned top government officials Monday
that they will lose their jobs if they do not set up farms.
	   Taylor, touring a rice and vegetable farm set up just outside
Monrovia with Taiwanese assistance, warned that Cabinet ministers
particularly should be worried.
	   ``If any minister does not have a farm of his own by now, then
that minister has failed to do what I had asked and he better be
watching out so that he doesn't get dismissed,'' said the
president, who wore a white baseball hat that read: ``Charles
Taylor, The Man.''
	   Taylor, who toured the farm under heavy security with Taiwanese
Ambassador Patrick Chang, said Liberians need to feed themselves
because so much of the country's foreign exchange is spent on food
imports.
	   ``A nation that feeds itself can then boast of independence and
sovereignty,'' said Taylor.
	   Taylor, who was one of Liberia's most powerful warlords during
the West African country's seven-year civil war, told officials
during a conference in July that they should all set up farms.
	   He admitted Monday, though, that he has yet to establish his own
farm, but insisted it would begin soon _ and would be the country's
largest.
	   Taylor won national elections last year after Nigerian-led West
African peacekeepers helped contain the civil war in which more

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Ivory Coast President Henri Bedie

says.
	   Bedie will address Parliament, meet President Nelson Mandela and
visit the township of Soweto.
	   -----
	   NELSPRUIT, South Africa (AP) _ A provincial premier denounced
the alleged fatal beating of a black man by five white men as a
racist act on Monday.
	   ``Is their hatred so much that they have to kill an innocent
Christian?'' asked Mpumalanga Premier Mathews Phosa.
	   The victim, Frank Serame, 52, died in the alleged daylight
attack on Saturday after five men blocked his car from moving
through the small town of Marble Hall near Nelspruit, in the
easternmost province of South Africa, police said.
	   His friend, Joseph Aphane, escaped to safety.
	   Serame, the father of six and a member of the Zion Christian
Church, was punched and kicked to death, police said.
	   Phosa said no form of racial violence would be tolerated in
Mpumalanga.
	   Police spokesman Senior-Superintendent Theo de Bruyn said the
five suspects were scheduled to appear in court on Monday.

	   LICHTENBERG, South Africa (AP) _ A passenger bus reportedly
collided with a cement truck, killing 17 people and injuring 82
others Monday in Lichtenberg, 175 kilometers (110 miles) west of
Johannesburg, police said.
	   ``We're still investigating the cause of the accident, but we
suspect that one of the vehicles veered out of its lane, resulting
in a head-on collision,'' police spokesman Louis Jacobs said.
	   The road safety organization Drive Alive repeated past warnings
that multiple fatality collisions would continue happening until
the government filled 8,000 vacant traffic policing positions.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Mozambique projects a 7 percent annual
growth rate for its gross domestic product until 2000, according to
financial documents agreed to by the government and the World Bank.
	   The figure is less than a reported 14 percent growth rate for
1997, but excludes large projects now under way, such as the
construction of an aluminum smelter outside the capital of Maputo,
the independent news sheet, Metical, reported last week.
	   The formerly socialist country has been inviting foreign
investment and encouraging a market economy since its first
democratic elections in 1994, part of the radical political and
economic change occurring in southern Africa.
	   Mozambique's inflation rate fell from 70 percent in 1995 to 5.8
percent in 1997, the Finance Ministry reported.
	   Private investment is expected to rise from its current 19.5
percent of GDP to 26 percent by 2007. That compares to about 17.3
percent in industrialized economies.

Malaysia names new Central Bank governor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to add new co-finance minister &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Consolidating his control over
Malaysia's embattled economy, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad named
close aides Monday to head the central bank and Finance Ministry.
	   Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman will take over from acting Bank Negara
Governor Zeti Akhtar Aziz, who has filled the role since former
Governor Ahmad Mohamed Don and his deputy, Fong Weng Phak, resigned
two weeks ago in opposition to rigid currency controls. Zeti will
stay on as deputy governor.
	   Last week, Mahathir announced sweeping currency curbs that
effectively isolate the nation's sinking economy from the global
free-market system. The measures include a fixed exchange rate and
ban on trading of Malaysian stocks overseas.
	   Already, benchmark interest rates have fallen to 8 percent from
more than 11 percent, a trend that analysts say is likely to
continue.
	   Ali, a close confidant of Mahathir, has been chief of the
powerful Economic Planning Unit in the Prime Minister Department
since the early 1990s and helped formulate Malaysia's wide-ranging
privatization program.
	   Mahathir also announced Monday that Mustapa Mohamed, the
entrepreneur development minister, would fill the newly created
post of second finance minister. It is unclear what Mustapa's
duties will be. Mahathir said he himself would retain the title of
first finance minister.
	   The appointments come amid a reshuffling of top-level policy
makers apparently designed to give Mahathir domination over the
country's economic and political leadership.
	   Mahathir named himself acting finance minister last week after
he fired Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who was also deputy prime
minister. Mahathir blamed Bank Negara's tight monetary policies,
which were backed by Anwar, for pushing the country into its worst
recession in 13 years.
	   Meanwhile, shares on the Malaysian stock market skyrocketed
Monday, propelled by aggressive buying by government-linked funds.
	   The surge caused the benchmark Composite Index, which had lately
suffered 10-year lows, to jump 23 percent to 445.06.

Kohl fends off embrace of Social Democrat challenger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday rejected a fresh
overture by his front-running challenger Gerhard Schroeder to
govern jointly after the Sept. 27 election.
	   Schroeder, playing to centrist voters, has been talking up the
possibility of leading a ``grand coalition'' of his Social
Democrats and Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) if the Social
Democrats win at the polls.
	   Schroeder tested a new variation in a weekend newspaper
interview, saying the formula could work if Kohl's party dumps its
Bavarian sister party, the ultra-conservative Christian Social
Union (CSU).
	   But Kohl brushed off Schroeder's idea as ``nonsense'' during a
campaign stop Monday in Berlin.
	   ``CDU and CSU absolutely agree that there will be no grand
coalition,'' he said later in a statement.
	   Kohl also came under renewed pressure from his junior coalition
partner, the Free Democrats, to announce when he might step down.
	   A number of people in Kohl's camp believe the 68-year-old
chancellor would improve his chances of a come-from-behind
re-election if he tells Germans he wouldn't serve a full four-year
term.
	   ``It's logical that, if we win the election, at some point there
will have to be a changing of the guards,'' the Free Democrats'
chairman, Wolfgang Gerhardt, said after a party meeting in Munich.
	   Kohl, in power for 16 years, has repeatedly insisted he is
running for a full term.

Israel, Palestinians diverge on progress in withdrawal talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu quote &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of a new U.S. Mideast peace mission,
Israel and the Palestinians diverged widely Monday on how much
progress has been made in talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said a deal was
``very close,'' while Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said the
gaps between the two sides ``still remain wide.''
	   With their contradictory assessments, each side apparently hoped
to invite maximum U.S. pressure on the other side.
	   The U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, is to arrive in the region
on Wednesday in an attempt to clinch a deal. Ross is to meet with
Arafat on Wednesday and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
on Thursday.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal that Israel withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank and the Palestinians commit to a detailed
blueprint for fighting Islamic militants under close U.S.
supervision.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. proposal.
	   Israel, after first rejecting the scope of withdrawal, said it
would hand over 13 percent, on condition that 3 percent of that
area be declared a nature reserve in which Palestinian land use is
restricted.
	   Israeli officials have said the two sides agreed on the scope of
the withdrawal and that the key sticking point was a Palestinian
refusal to commit to security measures as part of a crackdown on
Islamic militants.
	   ``We think we are very close to achieve agreement with the
Palestinians,'' Mordechai told reporters Monday in his halting
English. ``It needs that the Palestinians will be flexible ...to
fight against terror. The gap, I think is very close.''
	   Netanyahu said Israel and the Palestinians had reached ``an
understanding that was not written officially, but was clearly the
basis for continued progress.''
	   However, Arafat denied there was agreement on key issues. ``No
understanding has been reached and the gaps still remain wide,'' he
said.
	   The Palestinians have said the withdrawal issue is still on the
table and that they have not agreed to the restrictions on land use
proposed by the Israelis.
	   Arafat said the Israelis have yet to respond to various other
elements of the U.S. plan. ``Netanyahu is trying to bypass the
(U.S.) initiative and he is trying to divide it and he does not
want to make a total commitment to it,'' Arafat said.

	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ After kicking off the biggest air
show of the year with a blunt assessment of its recent costly
problems and management shakeup, the Boeing Co. announced Monday it
has received orders for 21 new jets with a list price of dlrs 1.1
billion.
	   Boeing said it will improve its performance after President
Harry Stonecipher acknowledged ``we've let down many commercial
airplane customers'' through late deliveries.
	   ``Where we have been too arrogant, too distracted or too
self-satisfied, we are going to be much more intense and much more
focused on things that really matter,'' Stonecipher said at a press
conference at the Farnborough International 98 show. ``I am
speaking here of satisfying the customer in every way.''
	   Stonecipher wound up fielding his first public questions about
the recent firing of Ron Woodard as president of Boeing's
Commercial Airplane Group. Woodard was replaced by Boeing executive
Alan Mulally, who was not at the air show because of what Boeing
called a prior personal commitment.
	   Woodard's management team simply didn't deliver, and ``we've let
down many commercial airplane customers,'' Stonecipher said.
	   Stonecipher said Boeing had only itself to blame for its
problems _ which have cost the company some dlrs 3 billion _ and
predicted executive bonuses would be lower as a result.
	   ``We did this to ourselves,'' he said. ``And we did it to
ourselves inside our factories.''
	   But the company quickly tried to put a better spin on things,
announcing the first big batch of orders at the Farnborough show.
Archrival Airbus Industrie promised to announce its own new orders
later.
	   Boeing said the International Lease Finance Corp. has ordered 17
new jets with a list price of around dlrs 900 million, including
nine 737-800s, six 757-200s, one 767-300ER and one 777-200ER. ILFC,
based in Los Angeles, is a big company that purchases jets which it
then leases out to air carriers.
	   Boeing also said KLM Royal Dutch Airlines ordered four new
737-900s with a list price totaling dlrs 200 million.
	   Separately, Continental Express Inc., the regional carrier for
Continental Airlines, said it was ordering 25 Brazilian-made
Embraer RJ145 50-seat regional jets with a list price totaling dlrs
375 million. The jets are manufactured by Empresa Brasileira de
Aeronautica S.A., based in Sao Paulo.
	   Continental Express president David Siegel said the small jets
will replace turboprop airplanes now in use as the carrier moves
toward its ``goal of transitioning to an all-jet fleet.''

Moldovan exchange houses suspended for illegal trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ More than one-third of exchange houses
in the Moldovan capital _ flooded by customers seeking to buy
dollars _ were closed by authorities after they broke banking
regulations, an official said Monday.
	   By law, exchange houses are allowed only a 10 percent difference
between the buying and selling rate. But in recent days, as dollar
demand has surged, some exchange houses had a 70 percent margin,
said Veronica Bacalu, vice governor of the Moldovan Central Bank.
	   On Friday, the Moldovan leu dropped 35 percent, from 4.8 lei to
one dollar to 6.5 lei to one dollar. On Monday, the leu recovered
to about 5 lei to one U.S dollar after commercial banks spent dlrs
5 million to prop up the Moldovan currency.
	   The Moldovan parliament will meet next Friday before the end of
its recess to discuss economic measures to be taken to prevent the
economic crisis, said head of Parliament Dumitru Diacov.
	   The International Monetary Fund suspended loans to Moldova after
the government failed to adopt market reforms.

Indonesia may be back into growth by 2000, says World Bank
</HEADLINE>
official &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Indonesia may begin to move out
of its profound economic crisis and see slight growth within two
years, a senior World Bank official said Monday.
	   Benjamin Fisher, the bank's country program coordinator for
Indonesia, told a seminar that Indonesia could see the beginnings
of growth of up to 2 percent in the financial year ending June 30,
2000.
	   ``The Indonesian recovery is going to surprise a lot of
pundits,'' Fisher told the trade organization Asia 2000 seminar.
	   But the news in the short term was not good, with the economic
contraction continuing this financial year, Fisher predicted.
	   Since July last year, confidence in the Indonesian economy has
collapsed and domestic demand has plummeted. Unemployment and
inflation have soared.
	   The Indonesian rupiah has depreciated by more than 80 percent
against the U.S. dollar and high foreign debt levels have left most
Indonesian companies technically insolvent.
	   Fisher said the prospects for Indonesia look good if stability
and reform can be maintained under the new leadership of President
B.J. Habibie.
	   The country's natural resources were very strong and the
Indonesian economy at the time of the crisis had not been nearly as
inefficient as people believed, he said.
	   However, corruption remains a serious problem, as does the
flight of foreign capital.
	   The Indonesian government could not afford to be complacent
about implementing reforms, Fisher said.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish police seized 4.5 kilograms (10
pounds) of unprocessed uranium and 6 grams (0.21 ounces) of
plutonium Monday and arrested eight people who were allegedly
smugglers looking for buyers.
	   Alerted by the nation's intelligence agency, undercover officers
posed as potential buyers and contacted two Kazak nationals, an
Azerbaijani and five Turks. The group allegedly planned to sell the
material for dlrs 1 million.
	   A ninth suspect, a Kazak national, fled the country a day before
the arrests, said a police official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The uranium was believed to have been smuggled from Kazakstan.
The police official said one of the suspects was a colonel with the
Kazak army. It was not clear whether he was on active duty or
retired.
	   The eight were due to appear in court later Monday.
	   The seized substances were sent to a nuclear research laboratory
for examination.
	   It takes about 25 kilograms (55 pounds) of processed,
weapons-grade uranium and eight kilograms (18 pounds) of plutonium
to make a bomb, according to U.S. government estimates. Other
estimates say a crude bomb could be made with 16 kilograms (35
pounds) of weapons-grade uranium.
	   The breakup of the Soviet Union has created concern about the
security at nuclear facilities throughout the former Soviet
republics, though Russian officials insist weapons-grade material
has never been stolen or sold.

German soccer coach Berti Vogts steps down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with possible successors, more background, quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German coach Berti Vogts, heavily
criticized after Germany's quarterfinal World Cup ouster and under
fire again following last week's two exhibition games, resigned
Monday.
	   Vogts quit after a telephone conversation with German soccer
federation (DFB) chief Egidius Braun, the DFB said in a statement.
	   ``Humanely, it hurts incredibly to carry out this separation.
But as DFB president, I had to realize that it had become
unavoidable,'' Braun said.
	   Vogts said he was quitting because he saw no more possibility to
carry on in the face of ``great public pressure'' and to preserve
``any remnants of dignity left over for me.''
	   The DFB said it will try to find a successor as quickly as
possible.
	   Germany, the reigning champion, travels to Turkey for a European
championship qualifier Oct. 10.
	   Vogts, 51, became coach in 1990, after Germany won the world Cup
title in Italy under Franz Beckenbauer. Vogts, a former
international defender with 96 caps, had served as Beckenbauer's
assistant.
	   Among possible successors being mentioned in the German media
was Jupp Heynckes, currently unemployed after being fired from Real
Madrid despite winning the Champions Cup last season.
	   Others were Christoph Daum of Bayer Leverkusen, Otto Rehhagel of
Kaiserslautern and Ottmar Hitzfeld of Bayern Munich. But all three
have contracts with their clubs, which are in European club
competitions.
	   Vogts was only the sixth German national team coach since 1923,
and only the second to lose job, after Jupp Derwall in 1984.
	   His overall record in 102 games was 67 wins, 23 draws and 12
defeats.
	   Under Vogts' guidance, Germany lost in the final of the 1992
European Championship, was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the
1994 World Cup and won the European title two years ago in England,
Vogts' only success.
	   But this summer's 3-0 loss against Croatia in the World Cup
quarterfinals in France renewed calls for his resignation.
	   But Vogts said he would stay to supervise Germany's rebuilding.
	   The team returned Sunday from a week in Malta, where it
practiced and played two exhibition games, a slim 2-1 win over
lowly Malta and a 1-1 come-from-behind draw with Romania.
	   The trip was supposed to mark a new beginning. But the tepid
performances only increased pressure on Vogts to step down.
	   ``Berti, how much longer?'' screamed a banner front-page
headline in the mass-circulation Bild newspaper.
	   Major newspapers united Monday in suggesting the only way out of
Germany's soccer crisis was for Vogts to resign.
	   Vogts invited eight rookies and recalled ``enfant terrible''
midfielder Stefan Effenberg after a four-year absence. But
Effenberg never lived up to expectations and the Germans were a
long way off from playing creative and attractive soccer.
	   Instead, Bild said, television viewers at home ``were tortured
with horrible soccer.''
	   Vogts lost another chunk of his fading authority when he was
forced to abandon his new system and revert to using a sweeper, or
libero, in the second halftime against Romania.
	   The German coach had attempted to introduce a more up-to-date
zone defense system, but the players failed to adapt to the new
roles and demanded a return to the old libero system.
	   ``Back to the stone age,'' commented the influential
Sueddeutsche Zeitung.
	   Germany has been using the libero system with two man markers,
or stoppers, for nearly 30 years, since the days of Franz
Beckenbauer. Vogts wanted to switch to the zone defense used by
most of the top teams but the change seemed beyond his players.
	   ``We could not adjust, we were completely confused,'' said
midfielder Mario Basler.
	   Germany's shortcomings were plainly visible even against Malta.
The Germans were helped by an own goal from Malta and won only on a
fortunate late goal. Past German teams would have easily scored a
half-dozen goals against Malta, which was routed 4-0 over the
weekend by Macedonia, itself no soccer giant.
	   An opinion poll conducted for the RTL television station Monday
said 72 percent of the Germans wanted Vogts to go.
	   The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said a new beginning could
not succeed ``because the team has lost confidence in their
coach.''
	   The newspaper suggested Vogts should find the ``right time'' to
quit.
	   The Frankfurter Rundschau, another national newspaper, said
Vogts had become ``the symbol of the downfall of the national
team.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia's economy floundering, the lower
chamber of parliament voted Monday to reject Viktor Chernomyrdin as
prime minister despite warnings that the situation was hurtling out
of control.
	   The State Duma voted 273-138 to reject Chernomyrdin after
President Boris Yeltsin met with parliamentary leaders in a bid to
break the stand off over confirming a new government. It was the
second time the Duma had refused to confirm Chernomyrdin.
	   ``The economic crisis is gaining momentum with catastrophic
speed,'' Chernomyrdin told lawmakers before the vote.
	   Russia has had an interim government for the past two weeks.
Chernomyrdin has been struggling to win confirmation from the
opposition-dominated lower chamber of parliament, leaving little
time to devote to the economic crisis.

Serb official banned; more Karadzic posters appear

	   PALE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A hard-line Serb official was
banned Monday from campaigning in Bosnia's upcoming elections,
while more posters of nationalist leader Radovan Karadzic appeared
in violation of election rules.
	   International officials overseeing the weekend election to
choose leaders of Bosnia's various top government levels have
banned more than 25 candidates of various parties so far in an
attempt to set up free and fair voting.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
added Vojisal Seselj, leader of the Yugoslav Radicals, to the list
for inflammatory statements about the Bosnian political situation,
OSCE officials said Monday.
	   Seselj, from neighborig Yugoslavia, supervises the Serb Radical
Party in Bosnia, but was not a candidate in the election. The OSCE
ruled that his recent speeches ``attacked the territorial integrity
of Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' which it said violated the Dayton peace
accord as well as election rules.
	   In a letter to the president of the Serb Radical Party in
Bosnia, Nikola Poplasen, OSCE head Robert Barry said Seselj was
``excluded from any further participation in the election
process.''
	   OSCE spokeswoman Nicole Szulc said Poplasen didn't complain
about the decision. Party general secretary Ognen Tadic said the
party refrained from reacting to avoid further penalties that could
affect Poplasen's candidacy.
	   In another violation of election rules Monday, posters of
Karadzic, Bosnia's leading war crimes suspect, appeared in his
stronghold of Pale, 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of Sarajevo.
	   The OSCE already banned two Bosnian Serb hardline candidates for
using Karadzic posters during a rally in the northern town of
Brcko.
	   ``It's going to happen again,'' OSCE spokesman Dardan Gashi said
of a possible ban of more candidates after hearing about the
appearance of new posters in Pale.
	   Karadzic led Bosnian Serbs into the 1992 rebellion against the
Muslim-led Bosnian government and headed the breakaway Bosnian Serb
entity during most of the 3 1-2 year war.
	   He has been indicted by the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal for gross
human rights violations, and the OSCE has banned all people
indicted for war crimes from any participation in the election.
	   Karadzic is believed to be hiding somewhere in the Bosnian Serb
half of Bosnia to avoid arrest by NATO-led troops.
	   The OSCE also has removed 18 Bosnian Croats from election lists
for various violations.
	   Most of them _ 15 _ were taken off because of what the OSCE
called persistently unfair election coverage from neighboring
Croatia's state-run television, which is broadcast throughout
western Bosnia.
	   Three others were removed because of the illegal participation
of the Bosnian Croat army in the election campaign.
	   The main Bosnian Croat party, the Bosnian Croat Democratic
Union, or HDZ, reacted bitterly and threatened to boycott the
election this Saturday and Sunday.
	   Over the weekend, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman supported
his protegees in Bosnia, saying the banning of candidates could
jeopardize the peace process.
	   Tudjman backed Croat hardliners in Bosnia throughout the war
that ended in 1995 with the Dayton accord.
	   Voters will choose leaders for Bosnia's two territories _ one
Serb and one a federation of Muslims and Croats. The three ethnic
groups fought the war for control of Bosnia-Herzegovina and now are
holding the third election under the Dayton accord.

	   Russia's beleaguered markets received another jolt on Monday
when the ruble crashed again and Central Bank Chairman Sergei
Dubinin offered to resign.
	   Yeltsin gets one more shot at nominating a prime minister. He
can opt for Chernomyrdin again or select another candidate.
	   Chernomyrdin warned that swift action was vital to try to stem
the crisis and he appealed for an end to the political squabbling
that has gripped the country. ``We are all standing on the edge and
no time is left for settling scores. We must begin acting,'' he
said.

	   Both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin met with the leaders of the
parliamentary factions at the Kremlin, but the Communists and their
allies insisted afterward they would again vote against
Chernomyrdin.
	   ``Our stance remains unchanged,'' Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov told reporters after consultations with Yeltsin.
	   ``He doesn't even understand the program he has proposed,''
Zyuganov said of Chernomyrdin.
	   However, Yeltsin defended Chernomyrdin's candidacy and said he
wouldn't nominate anyone else. Chernomyrdin held the post of
premier for five years before being dismissed in March.
	   The president had suggested that the parliament confirm
Chernomyrdin, and then assess his performance after a ``trial
period'' of six to eight months.
	   If the Duma rejects the president's candidate on the third vote,
then the constitution calls for the president to dissolve the Duma
and call new elections within three months. Yeltsin would
effectively rule by decree during the interim.
	   Chernomyrdin, speaking on national television Sunday, warned
that further delay in forming a new government would exacerbate the
nation's economic woes to such a degree that extreme nationalist
forces might try to take advantage of the turmoil and seize power.
	   ``They will not spare anyone. That would be a tragedy and
catastrophe for Russia,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   He also stressed that Russia still wants aid and cooperation
from the West to help ease the economic crisis, which has seen the
ruble collapse and prices soar.
	   ``Russia is now enmeshed in the global financial system, and
this system doesn't want any collapse,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   Chernomyrdin pledged to avoid backtracking on free-market
reforms and retrenchment into Soviet-style economic isolation
advocated by some hardliners.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian Central Bank canceled hard currency
trading on Monday as traders wanted only to buy dollars, not to
sell them. However, currency exchange booths on the streets
remained open.
	   At the start of Monday's trading, the ruble was quoted at 20 to
the U.S. dollar, down from 17 to the dollar on Friday. Deals which
are to take effect on Tuesday pegged the rate as low as 30 rubles a
dollar.
	   The ruble was trading at just over six to the dollar when the
crisis erupted less than a month ago.

U.S. trade official: Foreign investment crucial in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A senior U.S. trade official said
Monday that Malaysia's recent measures on currency controls could
further hurt the Southeast Asian economy.
	   ``There is no way that this region is going to recover without
support from the global financial community and investments by
global funds,'' said David L. Aaron, the U.S. undersecretary of
commerce for international trade.
	   Aaron is heading an American delegation to the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation meeting of ministers responsible for small and
medium-size enterprises.
	   Last week, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced sweeping
currency curbs that effectively isolate the nation's sinking
economy from the global free-market system. The measures include a
fixed exchange rate for the ringgit and a ban on trading of
Malaysian stocks overseas.
	   Aaron said it was important for Malaysia to pursue policies that
attract foreign investments.
	   He said it was important to attack the root causes of the
region's turmoil, adding that unstable currencies were only a
symptom of the problem and not the disease.
	   ``The underlying disease is the financial institutions and
corporations that are not creditworthy while the extension of
credit went too far, which calls for the essential need to reform
the banking system and restructure corporations,'' Aaron told the
national news agency Bernama. ``Currency controls are no substitute
for these steps, which will have to be undertaken.''
	   Aaron is also leading a U.S. trade mission to identify business
opportunities in Malaysia's high-tech sector. The mission
demonstrates U.S. commitment to Malaysia and the region, he said,
adding that the United States was ``here to stay as long-term
investors and partners.''
	   Aaron said one-fifth of Malaysia's total trade is with the
United States, while new U.S. investments here total dlrs 600
million.
	   On the two-day ministerial meeting, Aaron said the delegate were
working to overcome their vast differences on easing trade barriers
in nine key markets.
	   Japan and the United States were locked in great debate during
the last APEC trade meeting in June over the so-called early
voluntary sector liberalization.

Anne Frank Foundation hunting for missing film footage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS to UPDATE with quotes from World War II
researcher saying original footage is significant. &QL; 
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Researchers revealed Monday
they've been searching for years for lost film footage that gave
the world a few fleeting glimpses of Anne Frank before she went
into hiding from the Nazis.
	   Although copies exist, the Anne Frank Foundation disclosed that
the original of the black-and-white silent segment disappeared
after it was loaned to an American for a documentary about the
young Jewish diarist.
	   ``She is a symbol for people all over the world and you don't
want the original to be lost,'' said Peter Romijn of the
Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation.
	   The original reel hasn't been seen since it the unidentified
filmmaker borrowed it in the 1980s, said Ita Amahorseija,
spokeswoman for the Anne Frank Foundation.
	   The foundation realized it was missing in 1995 but kept the
embarrassing disappearance under wraps until this past weekend,
when the Dutch television newsmagazine Network reported the loss.
	   ``Most probably, the original was not returned,'' said
Amahorseija, whose foundation runs a museum in the Amsterdam canal
house where Anne and her family hid in a secret annex behind a
movable bookcase.
	   The footage of Anne, shot in 1941 before her family went into
hiding, was made by an amateur cameraman who was actually filming
the wedding day of Anne's neighbors.
	   The camera focused on the bridal couple coming out of an
apartment building, but panned upwards fleetingly, showing Anne
leaning out of a balcony watching the couple. Anne then turned her
head backwards and spoke to someone else in the house.
	   Because there are copies, the original probably has more
sentimental than historical value to those who have devoted their
lives to researching Anne and the Holocaust she came to symbolize,
Romijn said.
	   The footage was included in documentaries in the United States
and Germany in the 1960s. In more recent times, it was seen in the
documentary ``Anne Frank Remembered,'' which won an Academy Award
in 1996.
	   Word of the missing footage comes amid a fuss over the discovery
of previously unpublished pages of ``The Diary of Anne Frank,'' in
which she documented her life in hiding from the Nazis.
	   Squabbles over royalties and copyrights, as well as publications
of two new biographies on Anne, have also revived interest in her
life and diary.
	   Anne and her family were sent to Nazi death camps after their
hiding place was betrayed in August 1944. Anne died of typhus in
the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, just weeks before it was
liberated in the spring of 1945.

Russian Duma votes against Chernomyrdin

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia's economy floundering, the lower
chamber of parliament voted Monday to reject Viktor Chernomyrdin as
prime minister despite warnings that the situation was hurtling out
of control.
	   The State Duma voted 273-138 to reject Chernomyrdin after
President Boris Yeltsin met with parliamentary leaders in a bid to
break the stand off over confirming a new government. It was the
second time the Duma had refused to confirm Chernomyrdin.
	   ``The economic crisis is gaining momentum with catastrophic
speed,'' Chernomyrdin told lawmakers before the vote.
	   Russia has had an interim government for the past two weeks.
Chernomyrdin has been struggling to win confirmation from the
opposition-dominated lower chamber of parliament, leaving little
time to devote to the economic crisis.
	   Russia's beleaguered markets received another jolt on Monday
when the ruble crashed again and Central Bank Chairman Sergei
Dubinin offered to resign.
	   Yeltsin gets one more shot at nominating a prime minister. He
can opt for Chernomyrdin again or select another candidate.
	   Chernomyrdin warned that swift action was vital to try to stem
the crisis and he appealed for an end to the political squabbling
that has gripped the country. ``We are all standing on the edge and
no time is left for settling scores. We must begin acting,'' he
said.
	   Both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin met with the leaders of the
parliamentary factions at the Kremlin, but the Communists and their
allies insisted afterward they would again vote against
Chernomyrdin.
	   ``Our stance remains unchanged,'' Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov told reporters after consultations with Yeltsin.
	   ``He doesn't even understand the program he has proposed,''
Zyuganov said of Chernomyrdin.
	   However, Yeltsin defended Chernomyrdin's candidacy and said he
wouldn't nominate anyone else. Chernomyrdin held the post of
premier for five years before being dismissed in March.
	   If the Duma rejects the president's candidate on the third vote,
then the constitution calls for the president to dissolve the Duma
and call new elections within three months. Yeltsin would
effectively rule by decree during the interim.
	   Chernomyrdin, speaking on national television Sunday, warned
that further delay in forming a new government would exacerbate the
nation's economic woes to such a degree that extreme nationalist
forces might try to take advantage of the turmoil and seize power.
	   ``They will not spare anyone. That would be a tragedy and
catastrophe for Russia,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   He also stressed that Russia still wants aid and cooperation
from the West to help ease the economic crisis, which has seen the
ruble collapse and prices soar.
	   ``Russia is now enmeshed in the global financial system, and
this system doesn't want any collapse,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   Chernomyrdin pledged to avoid backtracking on free-market
reforms and retrenchment into Soviet-style economic isolation
advocated by some hardliners.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian Central Bank canceled hard currency
trading on Monday as traders wanted only to buy dollars, not to
sell them. However, currency exchange booths on the streets
remained open.
	   At the start of Monday's trading, the ruble was quoted at 20 to
the U.S. dollar, down from 17 to the dollar on Friday. Deals which
are to take effect on Tuesday pegged the rate as low as 30 rubles a
dollar.
	   The ruble was trading at just over six to the dollar when the
crisis erupted less than a month ago.

Israel, Palestinians diverge on progress in withdrawal talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu quote &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of a new U.S. Mideast peace mission,
Israel and the Palestinians diverged widely Monday on how much
progress has been made in talks on a West Bank troop withdrawal.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said a deal was
``very close,'' while Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat said the
gaps between the two sides ``still remain wide.''
	   With their contradictory assessments, each side apparently hoped
to invite maximum U.S. pressure on the other side.
	   The U.S. Mideast envoy, Dennis Ross, is to arrive Wednesday in
an attempt to clinch a deal. Ross is to meet with Arafat on
Wednesday and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on
Thursday.
	   On the table is a U.S. proposal that Israel withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank and the Palestinians commit to a detailed
blueprint for fighting Islamic militants under close U.S.
supervision.
	   The Palestinians have accepted the U.S. proposal.
	   Israel, after first rejecting the scope of withdrawal, said it
would hand over 13 percent, on condition that 3 percent of that
area be declared a nature reserve in which Palestinian land use is
restricted.
	   Israeli officials have said the two sides agreed on the scope of
the withdrawal and that the key sticking point was a Palestinian
refusal to commit to security measures as part of a crackdown on
Islamic militants.
	   ``We think we are very close to achieve agreement with the
Palestinians,'' Mordechai told reporters Monday. ``It needs that
the Palestinians will be flexible ...to fight against terror. The
gap, I think is very close.''
	   Netanyahu said Israel and the Palestinians had reached ``an
understanding that was not written officially, but was clearly the
basis for continued progress.''
	   However, Arafat denied there was agreement on key issues. ``No
understanding has been reached and the gaps still remain wide,'' he
said.
	   The Palestinians have said the withdrawal issue is still on the
table and that they have not agreed to the restrictions on land use
proposed by the Israelis.
	   Arafat said the Israelis have yet to respond to various other
elements of the U.S. plan. ``Netanyahu is trying to bypass the
(U.S.) initiative and he is trying to divide it and he does not
want to make a total commitment to it,'' Arafat said.

Philippine Stock Exchange to list bonds in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine Stock Exchange said
Monday it is planning to launch a new board next year for the
trading of commercial and government bonds in a bid to boost the
ailing stock market.
	   A heavy outflow of foreign funds since the start of the region's
financial crisis last year has caused daily volume on the Manila
market to fall to around 500 million pesos (dlrs 11.6 million) from
2 billion pesos (dlrs 46.5 million).
	   PSE Vice President Jose Alcantara said the new trading board
will include corporate bonds, bonds issued by local government
units and commercial bonds.
	   Alcantara said requirements for the listing of these debt
instruments are being finalized.
	   At present, the market has three boards. The first is reserved
for companies with a capitalization of at least 400 million pesos
(dlrs 9.3 million), the second for companies with capital stock of
at least 100 million pesos (dlrs 2.3 million), and the third for
venture capital companies with capitalization of at least 100
million pesos (dlrs 2.3 million).
	   Another board for small and medium-size companies with capital
stock of 20 million pesos to 99 million pesos (dlrs 465,000 to dlrs
2.3 million) is also being planned for this year.

Conservative Party calls ballot to endorse anti-euro policy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Conservative Party leader William Hague, seeking
endorsement of his policy of ruling out Britain adopting Europe's
single currency for a decade or more, on Monday announced a ballot
of members on the issue, which chronically divides the battered
opposition party.
	   The move appeared aimed at clamping down _ before the
Conservatives' annual conference next month _ on former Cabinet
ministers on the party's left who favor the new currency, the euro.
	   ``As long as our party is distracted by endless debates on the
single currency, we will always have one hand tied behind our back
as we fight this government,'' Hague said.
	   Ballot papers will be mailed within two weeks to the 330,000
party members, and the result announced before the Oct. 6-9
convention.
	   Divisions over the single currency contributed to the
Conservatives' shattering defeat in May 1997 national elections,
which ended the party's 18-year hold on power.
	   Labor Party Prime Minister Tony Blair says Britain may adopt the
euro after the next national elections, due in 2002, and many
analysts believe this will happen.
	   Hague's policy is to rule out adopting the euro at least until
after the government elected in 2002 has run its five-year term,
and not necessarily after that.
	   Eleven of the 15 member countries of the European Union will
adopt the euro when it starts Jan. 1, 1999.
	   Opposition among Conservative ``Euroskeptics'' is based on
resentment of yielding power over economic policy to a European
Central Bank.
	   Tory pro-Europeans include big names such as former Chancellor
of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, treasury chief in the ousted
government, and former Prime Minister John Major's deputy, Michael
Heseltine.
	   Hague, who defeated Clarke in a leadership contest last year,
refused to say if he will resign if he loses the ballot.
	   Labor gibed that Hague was panicking ahead of the party
conference.
	   ``If he wishes to lock himself into a position based on dogma
rather than the national interest, then the Tories will be the
losers,'' the party said in a statement.
	   The Conservatives remain unpopular, with only about 25 percent
support in opinion polls.

Turkey says alliance with Israel should not be seen as threat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with fresh quotes from joint press
conference, comment from Lebanon &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Trying to assure Turkey's jittery neighbors,
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said Monday that his country's
growing military ties with Israel should not be seen as a threat.
	   His host, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, even suggested that
the alliance could grow. ``It is a cooperation barred to none,''
Netanyahu said in a welcoming ceremony for Yilmaz in Israel.
	   However, later Netanyahu backtracked from previous comments that
the Turkish-Israeli relationship could the basis of a regional
defense axis.
	   ``Perhaps the use of the word axis which I think was attributed
to me or used by me creates a false impression,'' Netanyahu said
during a press conference with Yilmaz.
	   ``We are talking about the most natural cooperation between two
countries of a region that want to contribute to the stability of
the region,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Turkey has publicly rejected the idea of creating such a
regional structure until Israel negotiates peace agreements with
its Arab neighbors.
	   Turkey and Israel have been developing strategic ties since
1996, exchanging warplanes for training, conducting naval maneuvers
and signing several defense and trade deals.
	   Other countries in the region, especially Syria, Egypt and
Greece, have been following the alliance with concern.
	   Lebanese Foreign Minister Faris Bweiz spoke out against the
Israeli-Turkish alliance Monday.
	   ``We are very much worried about what is happening despite
Turkey's repeated affirmation that its relations with Israel do not
exceed the fields of training and technical matters,'' Bweiz told a
news conference in Beirut Monday.
	   ``We consider (the alliance) as a pincer's movement (intended)
against Arab states which did not make peace with Israel,
particularly Lebanon and Syria. No one can be convinced that this
(Turkish-Israeli) cooperation is merely for training,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu, however, in his remarks to the press, said neither
Syria nor Lebanon should feel threatened by the alliance.
	   Yilmaz also tried to allay the concerns of Turkey's neighbors.
	   ``It is important that the real dimensions of Turkish-Israeli
relations are well understood. Turkish-Israeli cooperation is not
against any other country,'' he said.
	   However, Yilmaz did speak sharply of Syria. ``Frankly, I don't
care how Syria comments (on) my visit. Everyone is aware of the
hostile intentions of Syria on Turkey,'' Yilmaz said.
	   Israel army radio said in an unattributed report that Yilmaz was
seeking an Israeli promise of military assistance in case of war
between Turkey and Greece in their dispute over control of Cyprus.
	   In July, a Turkish newspaper reported that Turkish warplanes
conducted assault exercises in Israel against Russian S-300
anti-aircraft missiles _ the same weapons system Greek Cypriots
plan to deploy later this year.
	   Israel has denied the report as ``baseless.''
	   Yilmaz, who is in Israel for a two-day visit, did not address
those reports Monday, but did say the missiles posed a serious
international threat.
	   ``We do not consider it as a matter related only to Turkey. It
must be a common concern for the whole western world including
Europe and the United States,'' Yilmaz said.
	   The Turkish prime minister is accompanied by dozens of business
leaders. Netanyahu said the two countries hoped to double trade to
drls 1 billion this year.
	   Earlier Monday, he visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in
Jerusalem.
	   With a somber face, Yilmaz, his wife, four of his Cabinet
ministers and several Turkish business people examined the museum's
photographs depicting the Nazi genocide of 6 million Jews.

Defense begins for Bosnian Croat general accused of atrocities
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-War Crimes Death &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A Bosnian Croat general on U.N.
trial for allegedly orchestrating war crimes against Muslims had no
control over the troops responsible for the atrocities, his lawyers
claimed Monday.
	   Defending Gen. Tihomir Blaskic before the Yugoslav war crimes
tribunal, U.S. attorney Russell Hayman claimed that renegade
Bosnian Croat forces ``did as they pleased'' during a bloody
Muslim-Croat conflict in central Bosnia in 1992-1993.
	   Blaskic was commander of a Croatian Defense Council militia unit
based in the central Bosnian town of Vitez during the worst
violence in early 1993 and did what he could to prevent or punish
war crimes, Hayman said in a summary of his defense case.
	   Independent Bosnian Croat militias, often controlled and
bankrolled by local politicians, ``followed (Blaskic's) orders ...
when it suited them and did not when they preferred otherwise,''
Hayman told the tribunal.
	   Blaskic, 37, dressed in a gray suit and red waistcoat, calmly
took notes during Hayman's opening statements.
	   The core of Blaskic's indictment focuses on a brief Bosnian
Croat campaign of terror unleashed against Muslims in April 1993.
The worst single atrocity was committed in the village of Ahmici,
where more than 100 Muslims were massacred and their houses
torched.
	   Blaskic is charged with 20 counts of war crimes and crimes
against humanity for ordering the attacks or knowing about and
failing to prevent or punish their perpetrators. He faces up to
life imprisonment if convicted.
	   Hayman described the attacks as ``a period of intense, chaotic
fighting.''
	   ``Command and control of those units was poor at the time of
that fighting,'' Hayman claimed. ``Evidence will show that time and
time again, top commanders on both sides of the Muslim-Croat war
toured the front lines literally begging local commanders to obey
cease-fire orders.''
	   A separate tribunal trial is currently hearing the case against
six Bosnian Croats _ all allegedly Blaskic's troops _ accused of
participation in the Ahmici slayings.
	   Prosecutors called 102 witnesses including survivors of
massacres blamed on Blaskic's troops and U.N. peacekeepers who
dealt with Blaskic in his headquarters in a Vitez hotel.
	   Hayman did not immediately say how many witnesses he planned to
call, but told judges that Blaskic would take the stand in his own
defense.
	   Blaskic, one of the most senior of the 25 suspects in tribunal
custody, turned himself in voluntarily in 1996 proclaiming he
wanted to prove his innocence.

Polls put incumbent Howard ahead in election race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John
Howard's re-election chances were bolstered Monday by new figures
indicating strong jobs growth and an opinion poll showing his
ruling coalition has surged ahead of the opposition Labor party in
the first week of the election campaign.
	   The Morgan poll in this week's Bulletin magazine said support
for the Liberal-National coalition jumped to 41 percent in the
first week of the campaign, while 35 percent of those surveyed
would vote Labor.
	   On a two-party basis, the coalition has 46 percent support
compared to 41 percent for Labor. The margin for error of the poll
was not published, but the margins usually are around 3 percent.
	   A different poll published last week also put the coalition
ahead.
	   Before the Oct. 3 elections were called last week, both opinion
polls pointed to a Labor victory.
	   Howard's push to campaign on strong economic management also was
bolstered by the release of the latest in a regular series of
analyses of the number of job advertisements in Australian
newspapers, thought to be a signal of economic growth. Figures
released Monday showed new job advertisements had risen by 3.7
percent in August from the previous month.
	   Meanwhile, election hostilities were put briefly on hold as both
Howard and Labor leader Kim Beazley attended a formal lunch to
welcome Ireland's President Mary McAleese to Australia.
	   Beazley and Howard sat across the table at the lunch and found
themselves agreeing on the important contribution of Irish
immigrants to Australian life.
	   ``Only an Irish president could still the guns of political
battle in the middle of an Australian election campaign,'' Howard
said.

Russian Duma votes against Chernomyrdin

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Russia's economy floundering, the lower
chamber of parliament on Monday again rejected Viktor Chernomyrdin
as prime minister despite warnings that the country's crisis was
hurtling out of control.
	   The State Duma voted 273-138 to reject Chernomyrdin after talks
between President Boris Yeltsin and parliamentary leaders failed to
break the standoff over confirming a new government. It was the
second time the Duma had refused to confirm Chernomyrdin.
	   ``The economic crisis is gaining momentum with catastrophic
speed,'' Chernomyrdin told lawmakers before the vote. He glumly
watched lawmakers reject him after a series of raucous speeches by
party leaders.
	   Russia has had an interim government for the past two weeks.
Chernomyrdin has been struggling to win confirmation from the
opposition-dominated lower chamber of parliament, leaving little
time to devote to the economic crisis.
	   The vote came as the economy continued to fall apart. Russia's
beleaguered markets received another jolt on Monday when the ruble
crashed again and Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin offered to
resign.
	   Yeltsin gets one more shot at nominating a prime minister. He
can opt for Chernomyrdin again or select another candidate. The
vote Monday saw Chernomyrdin picking up 44 more votes than on the
first vote Aug. 31. He needs 226 votes to be approved.
	   Chernomyrdin told the Duma that swift action was vital to try to
stem the crisis and he appealed for an end to the political
squabbling that has gripped the country.
	   ``We are all standing on the edge and no time is left for
settling scores. We must begin acting,'' he said.
	   Both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin met with the leaders of the
parliamentary factions at the Kremlin before the vote, but there
was no breakthrough with the president offering just a few symbolic
gestures.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said his party, largest in the
Duma, would never accept Chernomyrdin. He complained that Yeltsin
was not interested in a real dialogue with parliament and had not
listened to opposition calls for an alternative candidate for prime
minister.
	   ``The situation in the country is the result of the course
carried out by Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Chernomyrdin in the past few
years,'' he said before the vote. ``We are on the verge of
catastrophe and collapse.''
	   Yeltsin defended Chernomyrdin's candidacy and said he wouldn't
nominate anyone else. Chernomyrdin held the post of premier for
five years before being dismissed in March.
	   If the Duma rejects the president's candidate on the third vote,
then the constitution calls for the president to dissolve the Duma
and call new elections within three months. Yeltsin would
effectively rule by decree during the interim.
	   Chernomyrdin, speaking on national television Sunday, warned
that further delay in forming a new government would exacerbate the
nation's economic woes to such a degree that extreme nationalist
forces might try to take advantage of the turmoil and seize power.
	   ``They will not spare anyone. That would be a tragedy and
catastrophe for Russia,'' Chernomyrdin said.
	   He also stressed that Russia still wants aid and cooperation
from the West to help ease the economic crisis, which has seen the
ruble collapse and prices soar.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian Central Bank canceled hard currency
trading on Monday as traders wanted only to buy dollars, not to
sell them. However, currency exchange booths on the streets
remained open.
	   At the start of Monday's trading, the ruble was quoted at 20 to
the U.S. dollar, down from 17 to the dollar on Friday. Deals which
are to take effect on Tuesday pegged the rate as low as 30 rubles a
dollar.
	   The ruble was trading at just over six to the dollar when the
crisis erupted less than a month ago.

Serb official banned; more Karadzic posters appear

<TEXT>
	   PALE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A hard-line Serb official was
banned Monday from campaigning in Bosnia's upcoming elections,
while more posters of nationalist leader Radovan Karadzic appeared
in violation of election rules.
	   International officials overseeing the weekend election to
choose leaders of Bosnia's various top government levels have
banned more than 25 candidates in an attempt to set up free and
fair voting.
	   The main Bosnian Croat party, the Bosnian Croat Democratic
Union, or HDZ, reacted bitterly and threatened to boycott the
election this Saturday and Sunday.
	   Over the weekend, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman supported
his protegees in Bosnia, saying the banning of candidates could
jeopardize the peace process. Tudjman backed Croat hard-liners in
Bosnia throughout the war that ended in 1995 with the Dayton
accord.
	   Voters will choose leaders for Bosnia's two territories _ one
Serb and one a federation of Muslims and Croats. The three ethnic
groups fought the war for control of Bosnia-Herzegovina and now are
holding the third election under the Dayton accord.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
added Vojisal Seselj, leader of the Yugoslav Radicals, to the list
of banned candidates for inflammatory statements made about the
Bosnian political situation, OSCE officials said Monday.
	   Seselj, from neighboring Yugoslavia, supervises the Serb Radical
Party in Bosnia, but was not a candidate in the election. The OSCE
ruled that his recent speeches ``attacked the territorial integrity
of Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' which it said violated the Dayton peace
accord as well as election rules.
	   In a letter to the president of the Serb Radical Party in
Bosnia, Nikola Poplasen, OSCE head Robert Barry said Seselj was
``excluded from any further participation in the election
process.''
	   OSCE spokeswoman Nicole Szulc said Poplasen didn't complain
about the decision. Party General Secretary Ognen Tadic said the
party refrained from reacting to avoid further penalties that could
affect Poplasen's candidacy.
	   In another violation of election rules Monday, posters of
Karadzic, Bosnia's leading war crimes suspect, appeared in his
stronghold of Pale, 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of Sarajevo.
	   The OSCE already banned two Bosnian Serb hard-line candidates
for using Karadzic posters during a rally in the northern town of
Brcko.
	   ``It's going to happen again,'' OSCE spokesman Dardan Gashi said
of a possible ban of more candidates after hearing about the
appearance of new posters in Pale.
	   Karadzic led Bosnian Serbs into the 1992 rebellion against the
Muslim-led Bosnian government and headed the breakaway Bosnian Serb
entity during most of the 3 1-2 year war.
	   He has been indicted by the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal for gross
human rights violations, and the OSCE has banned all people
indicted for war crimes from any participation in the election.
	   Karadzic is believed to be hiding somewhere in the Bosnian Serb
half of Bosnia to avoid arrest by NATO-led troops.

Philippine government worries about funds for disaster relief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN FERNANDO, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines is running out
of money for disaster relief and won't have enough if heavy rains
hit the country as predicted later this year, disaster officials
said Monday.
	   The country has about 400 million pesos (dlrs 9.3 million)
remaining in its calamity fund, not enough if it is hit by heavy
flooding or other serious disasters, Defense Secretary Orlando
Mercado told local officials in central Luzon Island. Mercado is
also chairman of the Disaster Coordinating Council.
	   ``We have to apply Band-Aids to a major surgery problem,''
Mercado said of the fund shortage and the expected floods. He told
local officials they will have to rely on their own resources
because of the fund shortage.
	   Weather forecasters expect the Philippines will be hit later
this year by ``La Nina,'' the opposite of the ``El Nino'' weather
phenomenon that thrust much of the Philippines into a drought
nearly a year ago.
	   Central Luzon, the country's rice bowl, is a flood-prone area.
Its flooding problems have become worse in recent years because of
heavy siltation of river channels and drainage systems following
the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991, considered the century's
most powerful volcanic eruption.
	   Philippine weather forecasters expect heavy rains brought by La
Nina to begin in the last quarter of the year.
	   The country is visited by an average of 20 typhoons a year but
the severity of the rains is expected to increase this year because
of La Nina.
	   In a related development, an overloaded jeep carrying 30
laborers working on a major irrigation and flood-control project in
nearby Nueva Vizcaya province fell into a ditch Saturday, killing
two men and injuring 20 others, police said.
	   Police said the accident occurred at the work site of CE
Casecnan Water and Energy Co. in Castaneda in Nueva Vizcaya.
	   CE Casecnan is a joint venture of California Energy of the
United States and an Italian consortium led by an affiliate of
Cooperativa Muratori Cementisti CMC di Ravenna and Impressa
Pizzarotti and C. Spa.
	   Other members of the consortium are affiliates of Siemens A.G.,
Sulzer Hydro Ltd., Black Veatch, and Colenco Power Engineering Ltd.

Five soldiers injured in blast in Kashmir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Five minor explosions went off in
Jammu-Kashmir state on Monday, injuring three army soldiers in a
truck, an official said.
	   One blast, which damaged the truck, occurred as an army convoy
was passing through a narrow road near Drass, a village 175
kilometers (108 miles) northeast of Srinagar, the summer capital
and seat of a nine-year-old separatist campaign, a Defense Ministry
spokesman said.
	   No one was injured in the four other blasts nor was any property
damaged.
	   No group immediately claimed responsibility.
	   Kashmir has been wracked by secessionist violence since 1989.
More than 16,000 people have been killed in almost daily gun
battles between the guerrillas fighting for Kashmir's independence
and government forces.

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Former Catholic Bishop Eamonn Casey, who
stepped down six years ago after admitting he'd fathered a child,
announced Monday that he was retiring from work within the church.
	   Casey, 71, last month finished a five-year contract in a
missionary post in Ecuador and flew to London's Heathrow Airport.
	   He issued a statement through the Catholic information office in
Dublin saying he currently was living with relatives in England
because of his need for ``time for myself.''
	   ``I am not seeking or accepting any public pastoral ministry in
the church in Ireland, England or elsewhere,'' he said.
	   The former bishop of Galway, western Ireland, left the country
in 1992 after an American woman went public with news of their 1973
affair.
	   Annie Murphy protested that he wasn't paying sufficient support
for their son, Peter, now 23. The Connecticut woman wrote a florid
account of their romance called ``Forbidden Fruit.''
	   Casey had improperly used collection-plate donations to cover
his surreptitious child-support payments.

Spanish government minister weighs in on soccer team's woes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The education and culture minister waded
into a debate Monday on the Spanish national soccer team's latest
dismal showing and what to do about coach Javier Clemente.
	   The minister, Esperanza Aguirre, said she shared ``the immense
disappointment of all Spaniards'' over a humiliating 3-2 loss
Saturday to lowly Cyprus in a qualifying round for the European
Championship in 2000.
	   ``I am convinced that the entire leadership of Spanish Football
Federation is reflecting very seriously,'' she told reporters. ``It
must take measures.''
	   Aguirre declined to say if she thought Clemente should be fired.
But she appeared to go out of her way to avoid mentioning his name,
and judging from her tone it sounded like she does want to see him
sacked.
	   A ministry spokesman later insisted Aguirre was not out of line
by talking about sports.
	   Although the soccer federation is independent, the education and
culture ministry does have responsibility for sports issues. And
Aguirre gave her opinion only because reporters asked her,
spokesman Manuel Soriano said.
	   ``She does not want to get involved in polemics,'' he insisted.
However, ``the government cannot ignore an issue that dominates
public opinion.''
	   Soriano added: ``She is not going to say what kind of coach the
team should have.''
	   Clemente declined to comment directly on what Aguirre said, but
he did sound miffed.
	   ``I will make no evaluation. I have nothing to say because I
like the minister. The day that politicians talk about sports, we
in football will talk about politics.''
	   Clemente has been in hot water since Spain, one of the
higher-rated teams in the World Cup in France, failed to make it
past the first round of soccer's premier tournament.
	   Then on Saturday the team suffered a howling embarrassment by
falling to a Cyprus team that has only four professional players.
The rest work as electricians, or in banks, or for the Cypriot
national telephone company. The coach makes his living as a police
inspector.
	   Spanish newspapers screamed for Clemente's head over the
weekend.

Saudi calls on Iran, Afghanistan to exercise restraint
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia on Monday called on
Iran and Afghanistan to show restraint and resolve their dispute
peacefully, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
	   Iran has warned the Taliban religious army in Afghanistan that
it would take ``necessary measures'' to win the release of Iranians
believed held captive by the militia.
	   The Taliban deny they are holding any Iranians.
	   U.S. intelligence has suggested that Iran was poised for an
incursion into Afghanistan. Iran last week massed troops and
equipment on its Afghan border for military exercises.
	   ``We call on the governments of Iran and Afghanistan to exercise
self-restraint and work swiftly to resolve their differences
through peaceful means and brotherly talks,'' said a statement
issued at the end of Monday's weekly Cabinet meeting chaired by
King Fahd.
	   On Friday, Iran asked Saudi Arabia and the United Nations to
help secure the release of the Iranians allegedly held by the
Taliban.
	   Saudi Arabia is regarded as a major supporter of the Taliban and
is one of only three countries that recognize the group, which
controls most of Afghanistan.
	   Tehran has accused the Taliban of holding some 70 Iranians,
including 11 diplomats and a journalist.
	   The diplomats went missing after the Taliban captured the city
of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan last month. The diplomats
were working at the local Iranian Consulate.
	   Iran also has held Pakistan responsible for the fate of its
missing citizens and called on it to help secure their release.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to provide arms and other support to
the Taliban.
	   The Taliban have accused Iran of sending arms and money to their
opponents.

Boeing promises to improve after management shakeup

	   FARNBOROUGH, England (AP) _ The Boeing Co. had a bumpy landing
Monday at the year's biggest air show, offering up a blunt
assessment of costly problems and a management shakeup before
announcing orders for 21 new jets with a list price of dlrs 1.1
billion.
	   Boeing said it would improve its performance after President
Harry Stonecipher acknowledged ``we've let down many commercial
airplane customers'' through late deliveries.
	   ``Where we have been too arrogant, too distracted or too
self-satisfied, we are going to be much more intense and much more
focused on things that really matter,'' Stonecipher said at a press
conference at the Farnborough International 98 show. ``I am
speaking here of satisfying the customer in every way.''
	   Stonecipher wound up fielding his first public questions about
the recent firing of Ron Woodard as president of Boeing's
Commercial Airplane Group. Woodard was replaced by Boeing executive
Alan Mulally, who was not at the air show because of what Boeing
called a prior personal commitment.
	   Woodard's management team simply didn't deliver, and ``we've let
down many commercial airplane customers,'' Stonecipher said.
	   Stonecipher said Boeing had only itself to blame for its
problems _ which have cost the company some dlrs 3 billion _ and
predicted executive bonuses would be lower as a result.
	   ``We did this to ourselves,'' he said. ``And we did it to
ourselves inside our factories.''
	   But the company quickly tried to put a better spin on things,
announcing the first big batch of orders at the Farnborough show.
Archrival Airbus Industrie promised to announce its own new orders
later.
	   Boeing said the International Lease Finance Corp. has ordered 17
new jets with a list price of around dlrs 900 million, including
nine 737-800s, six 757-200s, one 767-300ER and one 777-200ER. ILFC,
based in Los Angeles, is a big company that purchases jets which it
then leases out to air carriers.
	   Boeing also said KLM Royal Dutch Airlines ordered four new
737-900s with a list price totaling dlrs 200 million.
	   Separately, Continental Express Inc., the regional carrier for
Continental Airlines, said it was ordering 25 Brazilian-made
Embraer RJ145 50-seat regional jets with a list price totaling dlrs
375 million. The jets are manufactured by Empresa Brasileira de
Aeronautica S.A., based in Sao Paulo.
	   Continental Express president David Siegel said the small jets
will replace turboprop airplanes now in use as the carrier moves
toward its ``goal of transitioning to an all-jet fleet.''
	   The Airbus chief executive, Noel Forgeard, told reporters that
his company remains intent on developing a new jumbo jet,
code-named the A3XX _ for which Boeing says there will be no
market.
	   Forgeard, however, pledged to someday break the monopoly Boeing
now holds on the jumbo jet business with its largest 747 models.
	   Forgeard said his company plans to launch a small jet, the A318,
with about 100 seats, if it finds enough customers.
	   Airbus, the European airplane-making consortium from Britain,
France, Germany and Spain, also said it was raising its list prices
by 3 percent, following Boeing's announcement in July it would
raise catalog prices by 5 percent.
	   Real prices paid by airlines may not go up quite so much _ as
airlines typically negotiate undisclosed discounts on their
purchases _ but Boeing and Airbus have made it clear they want to
start negotiating from a higher number.
	   Throughout the industry, companies are enjoying a bumper year,
with airlines filling their jets with passengers and busily
expanding their fleets.
	   However, analysts predict a sharp decline in 2000, made worse by
the Asian crisis.

Turkish northern Cyprus sets general elections for December
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Turkish Cypriots will vote for a new
parliament in their breakaway republic Dec. 6, a Turkish Cypriot
leader said Monday.
	   Dervis Eroglu, premier of the self-declared state, said the two
center-right governing parties _ the National Unity Party and the
Democratic Party _ reached an agreement to hold the elections in
December.
	   Cyprus has been divided between Turkish and Greek Cypriot
communities since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded the island
after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   United Nations-sponsored talks to reunify the island remain
deadlocked.

	   LLOYDMINSTER, Alberta (CP) _ A British soldier was in a Canadian
hospital Monday with cuts and broken limbs from a severe beating
over the weekend.
	   Police in Lloydminster, which straddles the Alberta-Saskatchewan

alley Saturday night near a liquor store.
	   The soldier suffered two broken arms and cuts and bruises to his
face. His condition has not been released.
	   He is part of a British military contingent training at Camp

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic refused
U.S. appeals Monday to immediately allow an investigation into
alleged atrocities in Kosovo, but an American envoy expressed hope
the Yugoslav leader may ultimately permit it.
	   John Shattuck said Milosevic ``showed interest'' in letting
independent investigators look into what the human rights envoy
called substantial evidence of war crimes and crimes against
humanity in the Serbian province.
	   ``We hope that willingness to entertain access to the region by
international forensic experts ... will indicate that (Milosevic's)
attitude is changing,'' Shattuck, the U.S. assistant secretary of
state for human rights, told reporters after the talks.
	   He said the need for impartial investigation is ``crystal
clear.''
	   Shattuck and former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole met Milosevic following a
weekend fact-finding tour of the besieged Serbian province.
	   The Americans and Europeans have tried for months to get
Milosevic to halt his offensive in Kosovo, where hundreds of people
have died and an estimated 265,000 have been driven from their
homes in a crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Those efforts have taken on new urgency with colder weather
arriving and as many as 50,000 people living in the open, left
homeless from the fighting. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the
main Yugoslav republic.
	   The American officials said they did receive assurances from
Milosevic that the International Committee of the Red Cross would
be allowed acces to hundreds of ethnic Albanians captured by
Serb-led government forces in Kosovo. They had pressed him to treat
captives according to international standards and to release those
not charged.
	   Later Monday, however, ethnic Albanians in Kosovo said almost
all the 500 men taken captive in a recent Serb offensive had been
released on Sunday. A few of the men said they had been beaten with
sticks.
	   Dole, who heads the International Commission for Missing
Persons, was not optimistic after having viewed what he called ``a
humanitarian catastrophe in the making'' in Kosovo.
	   ``I wish I could say that we have some good news ... that we
found something encouraging,'' he said Monday of his weekend tour
of southwestern Kosovo. ``I cannot. I was not prepared for the
damage and destruction.''
	   ``Americans and European leaders have pledged not to allow the
crimes against humanity which we witnessed in Bosnia to occur in
Kosovo. But such crimes are occurring. Yes, the response has fallen
far short,'' he said.
	   Dole said he and Shattuck called for a cease-fire and pullback
of Serbian forces in Kosovo so that the displaced could return
home.
	   ``If it happens, if images are transmitted around the world of
people freezing because they had been driven from their homes,
their homes burned and they don't come back from fear of police and
army, the repercussions will be dramatic,'' he warned.
	   Milosevic and ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova
agreed last week on a U.S.-mediated framework agreement under which
they would negotiate self-rule for Kosovo. But the secessionist
rebels have not endorsed it, and are unlikely to if Serb forces
continue burning houses and shelling villages.
	   In the latest evidence of continuing clashes between Serb forces
and secessionist rebels, the ethnic Albanians' Council for the
Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms said Monday that 25 people
were killed in a three-day offensive by Serb security forces in the
Prizren region.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Tiger Woods will join Mark O'Meara, Vijay Singh
and Ernie Els in the field for next month's World Match Play
Championship, tournament organizers said Monday.
	   Woods, who will partner O'Meara on the U.S. team at the Dunhill
Cup at St. Andrew's the previous week, was confirmed as a starter
Monday for the World Match Play.
	   The quartet will headline an elite field of 12 for the four-day
tournament Oct. 15-18 at Wentworth. Reigning U.S. Open champion Lee
Janzen is among the players being targeted to fill the remaining
eight places.
	   Woods, O'Meara, winner of the British Open and U.S. Masters, and
Singh, defending World Match Play champion and recent winner of the
PGA, are expected to be among the top four seeds who qualify
automatically into the second round of the tournament.
	   Els, a three-time World Match Play champion who was beaten by
Singh in last year's final, could miss out on a top four seeding if
Janzen accepts the offer to play the tournament.

<TEXT>
	   EISENSTADT, Austria (AP) _ A Hungarian was arrested Monday for
allegedly trying to smuggle 19 Kosovo Albanian refugees into
Austria, the Austria Press Agency reported.
	   The agency said Austrian police in the border province of
Burgenland stopped a small bus with the Kosovo Albanians _
including men, woman and children _ after receiving a tip from
Hungarian authorities.
	   The Hungarian was not identified.
	   Last week, the Austrian interior ministry reported a sharp
increase in the number of Kosovo Albanians seeking aylum in
Austria. They are among more than 260,000 people whom the United
Nations estimates have fled their homes during the six-month
crackdown by Yugoslav forces against secessionist rebels in the
Serbian province.
	   The Vienna newspaper Der Standard said recently that an average
of 200 Kosovo Albanians were seeking refuge here each week,
compared with 77 in the month of January before the crackdown.

Rebels say government allies bomb eastern Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Zimbabwe-Congo-Peace Talks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels said Monday that the allies
of President Laurent Kabila bombed the southern port of Kalemie for
the second straight day, resulting in civilian casualties.
	   Rebel spokesman Kin-Kiey Mulumba said the fighter jets flying on
high altitude dropped bombs Monday, a day after they missed targets
in the Lake Tanganyika port. He did not provide casualty figures.
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's
army and opposition politicians _ have been fighting for at least a
month. They accuse Kabila of incompetence, nepotism and corruption,
problems Kabila promised to eradicate after ousting longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997.
	   On Sunday, two bombs landed in the lake and missed Kalemie,
Mulumba said. The town of Lobutu, 360 kilometers (225 miles)
northwest of the eastern stronghold in Goma, was also bombed
Sunday, but there were no reports of casualties.
	   Lunda Bululu, a rebel leader, said the rebels were continuing to
fight in the southern, copper-rich Katanga province and southwest
of the capital Kinshasa.
	   Bululu said the peace talks in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, had not
stopped the fighting.
	   He said his forces shot down a Zimbabwean aircraft on Saturday,
killing an air force officer on board. Zimbabwe said one of its
planes had crashed.
	   Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have sent tanks, troops and
aircraft to help Kabila.
	   The rebels said they regrouped in eastern Congo and were
preparing to capture the air base at Kindu, from where the Angolan
or Zimbabwean aircraft were believed to have bombed the towns.
	   Congo has no operational air-force.
	   Bululu said so far the rebels had shot down six enemy fighter
jets.

Havel set to visit U.S. in September despite recent illness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Despite a life-threatening bout
with pneumonia last month, Czech President Vaclav Havel is set to
go ahead with a five-day official visit to Washington starting
Sept. 15, officials said.
	   ``There is no doubt the president's trip is going ahead
according to schedule,'' Havel spokesman Martin Krafl said Monday.
	   Havel is scheduled to meet with top U.S. officials including
President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright. Details of the visit are to be released
Friday, Krafl said.
	   Havel, 61, fought off a life-threatening case of pneumonia in
August and had an emergency surgery for a ruptured colon in
February.
	   A former chain smoker and veteran of communist jails, Havel has
been hospitalized five times since December 1996 when a third of
his lung and a cancerous tumor were removed.
	   Havel is preparing for the trip at his country residence in Lany
and plans no public appearances until an airport departure news
conference, Krafl said.
	   Three memebers of the president's medical team will travel with
Havel and the schedule foresees three hours of rest and
rehabilitation every day, according to the spokesman.

Greece: KLA intends to spread struggle to neighboring countries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Ethnic Albanians fighting for independence
in the restive Serb province of Kosovo want to expand their
struggle to Macedonia and Greece, the Greek foreign minister warned
Monday.
	   Theodoros Pangalos said representatives of the Kosovo Liberation
Army told him in the Albanian capital of Tirana last month that
Kosovo is just one of their goals.
	   Pangalos said the KLA comments ``don't lead me to the conclusion
that they are particularly wise and serious politicians.''
	   He made the statement after meeting with Milorad Dodic, premier
of the Bosnian Serb republic, who was in Athens for an official
one-day visit.
	   Pangalos, who has never before commented on his meeting with KLA
representatives, said he was ``amazed that with great politeness
and calm, they told me ... it is obvious that in the future they
must deal with the issue of the Albanian population in the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and with certain issues which exist
in Greece.''
	   Some Albanian activists in Kosovo and inside Albania proper have
never hidden their desire for the so-called ``greater Albania,'' an
area which comprises parts of the Yugoslav republics of Serbia and
Montenegro, Western Macedonia and northwestern Greece.
	   Although the idea has little or no support in Albania, it
remains talked about in Albanian-dominated Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since February,
when Serb forces cracked down on ethnic Albanian militants fighting
for independence. More than 230,000 people have been forced to flee
their homes.
	   There are fears that the conflict could spark a wider Balkan war
if it spills over into neighboring countries with large Albanian
populations.
	   Macedonia, neighbor to both Serbia and Albania, has its own
large and increasingly restive ethnic Albanian minority which could
be inclined to also start their own struggle for independence.
	   Large numbers of Albanian economic refugees are currently living
in Greece.
	   But Pangalos also warned that ``the abuse of power (in Kosovo)
by the Serb authorities must stop,'' and added that ``the Albanians
must also stop their attacks.''
	   ``The Serb administration says it is ready to stop the use of
violence as soon as the attacks stop,'' he added. ``The KLA not
only doesn't say it will stop the attacks, but it states it will
generalize the war.''

Russian economy takes fresh battering amid political uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Central Bank chief naming successor.
Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economic turmoil deepened Monday when the
ruble crashed dramatically, the Central Bank chief offered to quit
and parliament failed to approve Boris Yeltsin's candidate for
prime minister again.
	   Trading in U.S. dollars was canceled on Moscow's interbank
currency exchange because people only wanted to buy dollars, not
sell them.
	   Street exchange points remained open and were offering to buy
dollars at around 20 to 22 rubles. The Central Bank set the
official rate at 18.9, down sharply from 17 on Friday.
	   The ruble was trading at about 6.2 to the dollar when the crisis
hit last month. Since then people have scrambled to get their money
out of the banks and prices have soared.
	   Alongside political troubles, the market also reacted to the
news that Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin has offered his
resignation. He later nominated his deputy, Sergei Alexashenko, to
be his successor.
	   Dubinin, himself widely blamed for aggravating the crisis by
maintaining an artificially high ruble exchange rate, accused
parliament of failing to adopt anti-crisis measures.
	   ``There is no government and no chairman at the Central Bank,''
said Roman Serov, trader at Moscow's ABN-Amro Bank. ``I can't see
anything good resulting from this.''
	   Russia's economy has been in a freefall since mid-August, with
the national currency collapsing, prices soaring and the government
effectively defaulting on foreign loans.
	   Many Russians who receive their salaries in rubles besieged
stores over the weekend, buying up goods still for sale at
pre-crisis prices.
	   There were crowds at department stores, and the range of goods
at many grocery stores was dwindling. So far, the crisis has not
sparked unrest, but Russians were stocking up on household items,
clothing and basic foodstuffs.
	   In the eastern port city of Vladivostok, prices for meat, sugar,
macaroni and baby food have roughly doubled in recent days.
	   Political turmoil has aggravated the economic crisis.
	   The Communist-led Duma voted against Viktor Chernomyrdin for a
second time on Monday, setting the stage for a final confrontation
with President Boris Yeltsin. If the Duma once again rejects his
candidate, Yeltsin must dissolve parliament and call new elections.
	   Chernomyrdin is advocating an ambitious if somewhat unclear plan
to stabilize the situation within several months. He has also
sought to reassure Western governments and Russians that there
would be no retreat to a Soviet-style economic system.
	   Yeltsin, speaking at an international parliamentary assembly in
Moscow Monday, blamed overall instability at the world financial
markets.

<TEXT>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Thousands of singing, chanting
opposition supporters marched Monday to protest recent changes to
constitution that give the president sweeping powers.
	   About 10,000 demonstrators marched slowly through downtown
Abidjan, Ivory Coast's commercial capital. Every few minutes, they
would sit down on the highway, then move on.
	   A few dozen police in riot gear watched the marchers, but there
were no reports of violence.
	   A few people carried signs warning of a civil war and accusing
President Henri Konan Bedie of giving jobs and lucrative contracts
to members of his majority Baoule tribe at the expense of other
Ivorian ethnicities.
	   Some chanted anti-France slogans, accusing the French government
of backing alleged corruption by Bedie's administration. A group of
women shook their backsides at police, accusing them of being
Bedie's pawns.
	   ``Bedie is a thief!'' they shouted. ``France must listen to our
demands!''
	   Laurent Gbagbo, a rally organizer and head of one of the
country's largest opposition groups, the Ivorian Popular Front,
downplayed the possibility of violence, saying: ``It's a warning of
civil war.''
	   Widespread revolt would be a first for Ivory Coast, one of the
few West African countries that has never experienced either a
civil war or a coup.
	   The protesters said they wanted to disturb commerce and halt
traffic. That goal appeared to have been accomplished _ the
normally vibrant metropolis was nearly deserted and many workers
went home after the march caused a backlog of vehicles several
kilometers (miles) long.
	   Eventually, the group was to reach a rallying point where
opposition leaders were to address the crowd.
	   The march went ahead despite government efforts to have it
rescheduled to a weekend. Organizers said they had postponed the
demonstration since June to prevent interfering with soccer viewers
watching the World Cup on television. Soccer is Ivory Coast's
favorite sport.
	   ``Demonstrate, but don't destroy anything,'' Interior Minister
Emile Constant Bombet said in Monday's Le Jour newspaper,
addressing march organizers.
	   Government changes to the constitution, approved by parliament
at the end of June, have infuriated opposition leaders, who have
accused Bedie of wanting to spring a ``constitutional coup
d'etat.''
	   Controversy centers on a new article of the constitution which
appears to give the president power to cancel national elections or
delay the announcement of election results.
	   Opposition also focused on amendments extending the presidential
mandate from five to seven years, creating a second chamber _
one-third to be appointed by the president _ and altering majority
voting rules.
	   Bedie won presidential elections in 1995 after taking over
following the death of his predecessor Felix Houphouet-Boigny in
1993. The next elections are expected in 2000.

Greece: KLA intends to spread struggle to neighboring countries
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Ethnic Albanians fighting for independence
in the restive Serb province of Kosovo want to expand their
struggle to neighboring Macedonia and nearby Greece, the Greek
foreign minister warned Monday.
	   Theodoros Pangalos said representatives of the Kosovo Liberation
Army told him in the Albanian capital of Tirana last month that
Kosovo is just one of their goals.
	   Pangalos said the KLA comments ``don't lead me to the conclusion
that they are particularly wise and serious politicians.''
	   He made the statement after meeting with Milorad Dodic, premier
of the Bosnian Serb republic, who was in Athens for an official
one-day visit.
	   Pangalos, who has never before commented on his meeting with KLA
representatives, said he was ``amazed that with great politeness
and calm, they told me ... it is obvious that in the future they
must deal with the issue of the Albanian population in the Former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and with certain issues which exist
in Greece.''
	   Some Albanian activists in Kosovo and inside Albania proper have
never hidden their desire for the so-called ``greater Albania,'' an
area which comprises parts of the Yugoslav republics of Serbia and
Montenegro, Western Macedonia and northwestern Greece.
	   Although the idea has little or no support in Albania, it
remains talked about in Albanian-dominated Kosovo.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo since February,
when Serb forces cracked down on ethnic Albanian militants fighting
for independence. More than 230,000 people have been forced to flee
their homes.
	   There are fears that the conflict could spark a wider Balkan war
if it spills over into neighboring countries with large Albanian
populations.
	   Macedonia, neighbor to both Serbia and Albania, has its own
large and increasingly restive ethnic Albanian minority which could
be inclined to also start their own struggle for independence.
	   Large numbers of Albanian economic refugees are currently living
in Greece.
	   But Pangalos also warned that ``the abuse of power (in Kosovo)
by the Serb authorities must stop,'' and added that ``the Albanians
must also stop their attacks.''
	   ``The Serb administration says it is ready to stop the use of
violence as soon as the attacks stop,'' he said. ``The KLA not only
doesn't say it will stop the attacks, but it states it will
generalize the war.''

Austro-U.S.-Croatian consortium awarded second mobile phone

network &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia's government on Monday awarded a
10-year concession for the second mobile phone network to a
consortium composed of Austrian, American and Croatian firms,
VIP-net.
	   Until now, only state-run Croatian Post and Telecommunications,
or HPT, had a GSM, or Global System of Mobile, network.
	   About 3 percent of Croatia's 4.5 million people use mobile
phones.
	   The latest auction, for the first privately owned GSM network,
has been dubbed by Croatian media as the ``deal of the century.''
Analysts estimate that the profit over ten years could reach 10
billion kuna (dlrs 1.76 billion).
	   VIP-net combines Austria's state-owned MOBILKOM AG, the U.S.
Western Wireless International and Croatia's Vecernji list daily,
Post Bank and INGRA. Croatian firms have 51 percent of shares in
the consortium.
	   VIP-net plans to invest up to 1.5 billion kuna (dlrs 250 mil.)
in building the network, the state-run news agency HINA reported.
It also promised to open up to 500 jobs.
	   Firms that also contested the bid were Zagitel, consortium of
Croatia's oil company INA, the largest bank Zagrebacka Banka,
Deutsche Telekom and Hungary's Westel; Rumeli Holding from Turkey
and HR Telekom, an association of a few Croatian companies.

King Albert keeps his head as Belgium mints first euros

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - King Albert II minted Belgium's first
euro coins Monday safe in the knowledge that his royal profile will
continue to grace the country's currency even after the demise of
the Belgian franc.
	   As a choir sang out the rousing Beethoven tune that the European
Union has adopted as its anthem, King Albert hit three buttons that
sent the first of 3 billion Belgian euro coins cascading from the
Royal Mint's machines.
	   They'll be stashed away until the European currency hits the
streets in 2001.
	   The euro will be the common currency of 11 nations. But while
one face of the coins features a uniform design showing a map of
Europe, each country is allowed to put its own symbols on the flip
side. King Albert's head will therefore keep its place on Belgium's
coins.
	   The King didn't comment publicly about the new coins, leaving
the talking to his ministers.
	   ``This is a historic day for the citizens of our country,'' said
Finance Minister Jean-Jacques Viseur. ``The cthe euro as their common currency on Jan. 1, 1999.
	   For the first three years, it will be used only for non-cash
transactions until euro coins and bills start filling the purses
and pockets of 290 million Europeans on Jan. 1, 2002.
	   Belgium follows France and Germany in starting to mint the
euros. The mammoth scale of the operation means they have to start
early to get all the coins minted in time.
	   Belgium's Royal Mintmaster Romain Coenen said his machines will
churn out 4 million euro coins a day. France started production in
May aiming at 7.6 billion euro coins by 2002.
	   Accompanied by Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene and a bevy of
other ministers, King Albert celebrated the birth of the euro in
typical Belgian fashion. A specially brewed ``euro-beer'' was
served for the dignitaries to toast the new coins and a top Belgian
chocolate makers handed out chocolate replicas of the euros coins.
	   The minting machines set in motion by the monarch spewed out
coins worth 1 euro, 10 cent and 1 cent. Production will start later
on 2 euro, 2 cent, five cent, 20 cent and 50 cent coins and the
range of banknotes ranging in value from 5 to 500 euros. Although
the exact value of the euro won't be set until Jan. 1, it's
expected to trade at around 1.1 to the dollar.
	   Officials said the more than 2 billion Belgian franc coins in
circulation will be gathered during the first three months of 2002,
melted down and the resulting 13,000 tons of metal sold off.
	   An aide to the finance minister said European governments will
avoid rushing to sell the copper, nickel and other metals, to avoid
upsetting metal markets.

Twenty flood victims feared drowned during evacuation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Twenty people, including women and
children, were feared drowned Monday after a relief boat evacuating
them from their flooded village sank in a river, police said.
	   Two men rowing the boat were also missing after it went down in
River Padma in Faridpur district, 40 miles (65 kilometers)
southwest of Dhaka, the capital.
	   Hopes of finding any one alive faded after rescue boats failed
to trace the capsized boat after hours of searching, a police
officer said on condition of anonymity.
	   The century's most prolonged floods have submerged two-thirds of
Bangladesh, leaving 800 people dead and about 30 million _ one
fourth of the population _ homeless.

World Bank to consider new loans to Ukraine next week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The World Bank's board of directors will
meet next week to consider resuming aid to Ukraine, a top bank
official said Monday.
	   New assistance to Ukraine from the World Bank became possible
after approval by the International Monetary Fund of a large loan
to the former Soviet republic last week, said regional World Bank
director Paul Siegelbaum.
	   Siegelbaum arrived in Kiev on Sunday to conduct meetings with
top government officials in advance of the directors' meeting.
	   The IMF approved a dlrs 2.2 billion loan to Ukraine last Friday
in a move seen as crucial to the country's shaky financial system,
which was badly affected by the financial crisis in neighboring
Russia.
	   The decision followed the fund's suspension of aid to Ukraine
last March after the government failed to stick to IMF requirements
to cut state spending and introduce other reforms.
	   World Bank officials said at the time that the bank's further
cooperation with Ukraine was conditioned on resumption of IMF aid
to the country.
	   During a meeting with Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko on
Monday, Siegelbaum described the situation in Ukraine as
``difficult'' but said the country is capable of avoiding a
financial crisis as deep as Russia's.
	   One reason is that Ukraine has less foreign debt than Russia and
was less vulnerable to the worldwide drop in oil prices.
	   Ukrainian officials said total aid from the World Bank, if
approved, would amount to dlrs 900 million for four separate
projects.

U.N. envoy keeps ties with rebel leader despite gov't disapproval
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The U.N. envoy to Angola said Monday he
would continue to deal with the leader of the former rebel group
UNITA, Jonas Savimbi, even as the government warned it would arrest
Savimbi and his officials on sight.
	   United Nations envoy Issa Diallo said he would maintain contacts
with Savimbi and his representatives in the capital, though he did
not rule out talks with a group of UNITA dissidents who last week
broke with Savimbi and set up a rival leadership.
	   Tension surrounding Angola's crumbling peace process mounted
over the weekend after the government said it was severing all
contact with Savimbi and would deal only with the breakaway group.
	   National police chief Fernando da Piedade on Monday described
Savimbi and his followers as ``bandits'' and said they would be
``fought and arrested.''
	   However, Savimbi's officials were still moving freely around the
capital Monday.
	   UNITA and the government signed a U.N.-brokered peace accord in
1994 to end their two-decade civil war in this vast southwest
African nation, but implementation of the deal is running far
behind schedule.
	   The U.N. Security Council has imposed sanctions on UNITA, a
Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, for its failure to comply with the peace
accord.
	   The government says Savimbi has 30,000 troops hidden in the
bush.
	   The UNITA dissidents accused Savimbi _ who lives in his central
highland stronghold of Andulo, 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast
of Luanda _ of not wanting peace.
	   Diallo said on the U.N. daily radio program in Angola that
UNITA's ``internal quarrel'' should not be allowed to affect the
peace deal.
	   Savimbi's representatives in Luanda had been negotiating
implementation of the outstanding provisions of the peace accord.
	   They accuse the government and police of intimidating them. They
claim that their cars and bodyguards, which were granted as part of
the peace pact, have been withdrawn and that police have prevented
them from entering the UNITA headquarters in the capital.

Bulgarian soccer coach Hristo Bonev resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgarian Coach Hristo Bonev resigned
Monday amid harsh criticism following the national squad's poor
performance at the World Cup and Sunday's humiliating loss in the
first Euroqualifier.
	   Bonev announced his resignation in a statement faxed to the
Bulgarian Soccer Union.
	   ``I feel very tired. The tense atmosphere hinders normal work.
Too many things have to be changed in Bulgarian soccer. This time
my decision is final and nothing can make me change it,'' Bonev
said.
	   Bonev, 51, took over the national team from his predecessor
Dimitar Penev in August 1996, immediately after Bulgaria's fiasco
at Euro 96 in Britain.
	   He faced some tough times with the squad, after several players
boycotted the national team, including Hristo Stoichkov, Lyuboslav
Penev and Yordan Lechkov.
	   Bulgaria had to play almost half its qualifying games for the
finals in France without those decisive players.
	   Eventually, Bonev, a former national forward with a Bulgarian
record of 48 goals in international matches to his credit, managed
to get his way.
	   Under his guidance, Bulgaria managed to qualify for the World
Cup in France, but was smashed 6-1 by Spain and failed to get past
the first round.
	   After that fiasco Bonev first said he was quitting, but later
decided to stay at least for the first three qualifying matches for
Euro 2000 despite harsh criticism from the media and leading
players.
	   But Sunday night's 3-0 loss against Poland exhausted fans'
patience. Some 13,000 attending the game at the stadium in the
Black Sea town of Burgas demanded he resign immediately.
	   Among possible successors being mentioned in Bulgarian media are
Dimitar Penev, now coach of CSKA Sofia, and Dimitar Dimitrov,
Bonev's assistant and coach of last season's champion Liteks
Lovech.

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Former Catholic Bishop Eamonn Casey, who
stepped down six years ago after admitting he'd fathered a child,
announced Monday that he was retiring from work within the church.
	   Casey, 71, last month finished a five-year contract in a
missionary post in Ecuador and flew to London's Heathrow Airport.
	   He issued a statement through the Catholic information office in
Dublin saying he currently was living with relatives in England
because of his need for ``time for myself.''
	   ``I am not seeking or accepting any public pastoral ministry in
the church in Ireland, England or elsewhere,'' he said.
	   The former bishop of Galway, western Ireland, left the country
in 1992 after an American woman went public with news of their 1973
affair.
	   Annie Murphy protested that he wasn't paying sufficient support
for their son, Peter, now 23. The Connecticut woman wrote a florid
account of their romance called ``Forbidden Fruit.''
	   Casey had improperly used collection-plate donations to cover
his surreptitious child-support payments.

	   Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Austria,

	   The minting machines spewed out coins worth 1 euro, 10 cent and
1 cent. Production will start later on 2 euro, 2 cent, 5 cent, 20
cent and 50 cent coins and the range of banknotes ranging in value
from 5 to 500 euros. Although the exact value of the euro won't be
set until Jan. 1, it's expected to trade at around 1.1 to the
dollar.
	   Officials said the more than 2 billion Belgian franc coins in
circulation will be gathered during the first three months of 2002,
melted down and the resulting 13,000 tons of metal sold off.
	   An aide to the finance minister said European governments will
avoid rushing to sell the copper, nickel and other metals, to avoid
upsetting metal markets.

Conservatives suspend peer over reports he dealt in drugs at
</HEADLINE>
Parliament &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ He is one of the youngest members of the House of
Lords, scion of an ancient clan (motto: Neither Covet Nor Fear).
But he confesses he has no interest in politics, preferring to run
a motor scooter shop.
	   Just as well. Because the 10th Lord Hardwicke found himself
suspended from the Conservative Party caucus in the House of Lords
Monday over reports he dealt in cocaine in the hallowed corridors
of Parliament. Expulsion could follow.
	   ``The Conservative Party has a robust anti-drugs policy and we
condemn drug-dealing in all forms,'' a party spokeswoman said,
speaking anonymously.
	   There was no immediate comment from Joseph Phillip Sebastian
Yorke, just 27, who admits he only shows up at the House of Lords
twice a week to collect 140 pounds (dlrs 220) in attendance fees.
	   The tabloid News of the World reported Sunday that the peer
tried to sell cocaine to one of its undercover reporters at the
House of Lords when lawmakers were recalled last week to debate
stricter security legislation after a fatal bombing in Northern
Ireland.
	   The Times on Monday quoted an unidentified senior Conservative
Party source as saying that Lord Cranborne, the party's leader in
the House of Lords, gave Hardwicke ``a chance to defend himself and
clear his name. You can take it that he hasn't justified his
position at all and such behavior will not be tolerated,'' The
Times quoted the source as saying.
	   Under party rules, the matter likely now will be referred to the
party's new ethics and integrity committee. Set up to counter
allegations of sleaze, it has the power to expel Hardwicke from the
party.
	   Hardwicke _ ''Lord Scooty'' to his friends _ was just three when
he inherited the peerage from his grandfather, his father having
died the year before. News reports said he only agreed to take his
seat in the House of Lords at the request of his cousin, Lord
Hesketh, a former Tory chief whip.
	   He rarely takes part in debates, saying he finds public speaking
boring.
	   His family once owned extensive properties in Cambridgeshire,
north of London, but the 5th earl gambled the family fortune away
and the 10th earl lives in a modest London apartment.

U.N. envoy keeps ties with rebel leader despite gov't disapproval
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ The U.N. envoy to Angola said Monday he
would continue to deal with the leader of the former rebel group
UNITA although the government warned it would arrest Jonas Savimbi
and his officials on sight.
	   Issa Diallo said he would maintain contacts with Savimbi and his
representatives in the capital, though he did not rule out talks
with a group of UNITA dissidents who last week broke with Savimbi
and set up a rival leadership in the former Portuguese colony.
	   Tension surrounding Angola's crumbling peace process mounted
over the weekend after the government said it was severing all
contact with Savimbi and would deal only with the breakaway group.
	   National police chief Fernando da Piedade on Monday described
Savimbi and his followers as ``bandits'' and said they would be
``fought and arrested.''
	   However, Savimbi's officials were still moving freely around the
capital Monday.
	   UNITA and the government signed a U.N.-brokered peace accord in
1994 to end their two-decade civil war in this vast southwest
African nation, but implementation of the deal is running far
behind schedule.
	   The U.N. Security Council has imposed sanctions on UNITA, a
Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, for its failure to comply with the peace
accord.
	   The government says Savimbi has 30,000 troops hidden in the
bush.
	   The UNITA dissidents accused Savimbi _ who lives in his central
highland stronghold of Andulo, 480 kilometers (300 miles) southeast
of Luanda _ of not wanting peace.
	   Diallo said on the U.N. daily radio program in Angola that
UNITA's ``internal quarrel'' should not be allowed to affect the
peace deal.
	   Savimbi's representatives in Luanda had been negotiating
implementation of the outstanding provisions of the peace accord.
	   They accuse the government and police of intimidating them. They
claim that their cars and bodyguards, which were granted as part of
the peace pact, have been withdrawn and that police have prevented
them from entering the UNITA headquarters in the capital.

Bulgarian soccer coach Hristo Bonev resigns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgarian Coach Hristo Bonev resigned
Monday amid harsh criticism following the national squad's poor
performance at the World Cup and Sunday's humiliating loss in the
first Euroqualifier.
	   Bonev announced his resignation in a statement faxed to the
Bulgarian Soccer Union.
	   ``I feel very tired. The tense atmosphere hinders normal work.
Too many things have to be changed in Bulgarian soccer. This time
my decision is final and nothing can make me change it,'' Bonev
said.
	   Bonev, 51, took over the national team from Dimitar Penev in
August 1996, immediately after Bulgaria's fiasco at Euro 96 in
Britain.
	   He faced some tough times with the squad after several players
boycotted the national team, including Hristo Stoichkov, Lyuboslav
Penev and Yordan Lechkov.
	   Bulgaria had to play almost half its qualifying games for the
finals in France without those decisive players.
	   Eventually, Bonev, a former national forward with a Bulgarian
record of 48 goals in international matches to his credit, managed
to get his way.
	   Under his guidance, Bulgaria managed to qualify for the World
Cup in France, but was smashed 6-1 by Spain and failed to get past
the first round.
	   After that fiasco Bonev first said he was quitting, but later
decided to stay at least for the first three qualifying matches for
Euro 2000 despite criticism from the media and leading players.
	   But Sunday night's 3-0 loss against Poland exhausted fans'
patience. Some 13,000 attending the game at the stadium in the
Black Sea town of Burgas demanded he resign immediately.
	   Among possible successors being mentioned in Bulgarian media are
Dimitar Penev, now coach of CSKA Sofia, and Dimitar Dimitrov,
Bonev's assistant and coach of last season's champion Liteks
Lovech.

	   AMBERG, Germany (AP) _ A hand grenade exploded Monday during
classroom training at a German army base, injuring 22 soldiers,
five of them seriously, the military said.
	   One of the soldiers was in life-threatening condition following
the accident at a tank unit's base here, some 70 kilometers (40
miles) east of Nuremberg in northern Bavaria.
	   It was unclear why a live grenade was used in the training,
which is against army rules, base commander Gen. Goetz Gliemeroth
said.
	   ``It is to be determined whether someone acted grossly
negligent, or whether some other circumstance is responsible,''
Gliemeroth said.
	   The army said it ruled out sabotage.
	   Military investigators, police and state explosives experts were
investigating the accident.
	   The injured, most of them suffering trauma and shock, were taken
to area hospitals. The soldier with life-threatening injuries was
flown by helicopter to a hospital in Nuremberg.

Sprinter Frankie Fredericks pulls out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Insulted by his prime minister's
remarks, Namibian sprinter Frankie Fredericks has withdrawn from
the Commonwealth Games.
	   In a letter faxed to the daily Namibian, Fredericks said a
comparison that Prime Minister Hage Geingob drew between the
sprinter and boxer Harry Simon had ``dulled'' his desire to
represent Namibia at the competition that starts Wednesday in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia.
	   Geingob was quoted at a World Boxing Organization championship
match last month in Johannesburg, South Africa, as saying that
Simon had outclassed Fredericks by winning the super welterweight
title.
	   ``Frank is a world class sprinter, but he doesn't have a gold
from Olympics yet,'' Geingob said. ``By way of being Namibian
heroes, they will rank about the same, but Harry is a world
champion.''
	   Geingob stood by his remarks in a statement released Monday in
Windhoek.
	   Namibian sports officials expressed regret that Fredericks had
pulled out of the Commonwealth Games. But they pointed out that he
still plans to compete in the IAAF World Cup competition in
Johannesburg that starts Friday.
	   ``One must remember that if he had run at the Commonwealth
Games, it would have been 40 hours after the Johannesburg meet, and
Frank would definitely have been fatigued after the long flight,''
Namibian National Sports council director Piet du Plooy said.
	   Fredericks, who took silver in the 100 and 200 meter races in
the past two Olympics, was Namibia's sole hope for a medal in
Malaysia. He is the defending Commonwealth Games champion in the
200.
	   ``The unfair comparison drawn between myself and Harry Simon has
come as a great disappointment,'' Fredericks' statement said.
``When ... after 10 years of dedicated training and tiring travel
worldwide, my achievements are linked solely to not winning gold at
the Olympic Games, I am compelled to take stock of my situation.''
	   His absence at Kuala Lumpur is a further blow to the
Commonwealth Games, which is already missing some of the world's
top sprinters.
	   Canada's Donovan Bailey, the Olympic 100 meter champion and
world record-holder, countryman Bruny Surin and Trinidad's Ato
Boldon, the world 200 meter champion, have already said they will
not participate.

With McGwire at 60, the Sammy Sosa show comes to town
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with quotes from news conference,
trim. &QL; 
 &UR; By TED ANTHONY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Moments after Mark McGwire stepped to the
plate, bats cracked and balls sailed over the fence. But it was his
St. Louis teammates hitting the home runs. McGwire came up empty,
his day's legacy a wicked line drive that curved heartachingly
foul.
	   Now, with Sammy Sosa and the Chicago Cubs in town Monday and
McGwire on pause at No. 60, baseball's leading home-run hitters are
set to spend the next two days watching each other try to become
the king of the long ball. Busch Stadium is sold out; anticipation
grows with each at-bat.
	   Sitting bicep to bicep beyond the right-field wall, the two
hardly looked like rivals for one of baseball's most cherished
records. They laughed, joked and high-fived throughout a news
conference Monday.
	   ``Wouldn't it be great if we just ended up tied?'' McGwire said.
	   ``My situation is different,'' Sosa said. ``I'm trying to make
the playoffs.''
	   Sosa's Cubs are a game ahead of the New York Mets in the
National League wild-card race, while the Cardinals are out of
contention. But the individual confrontation claims the spotlight
for these two days.
	   ``If you can't be looking forward to these two games, then your
heart is not beating,'' McGwire said.
	   ``The situation is going to be out of control,'' said Sosa, who
has 58 homers.
	   Watching in the stands Sunday when the Cardinals played the Reds
were Roger Maris' four sons and two daughters, with Roger Maris Jr.
holding the bat his father used to hit No. 61 in 1961. The Maris
boys, boys no longer, have their father's intense gaze and carry
his mantle; they lined up after the game to praise McGwire and
Sosa.
	   ``Dad always said every record was made to be broken,'' said
Randy Maris, 37, ``He knew this one was going to be broken, too.''
	   In all, McGwire and Sosa have homered on the same day 20 times
this season. And when they're apart, they try to watch each other
on television.
	   ``I am a fan of the game as well as a player, and I absolutely
enjoy watching him play,'' McGwire said. ``He is having an
absolutely magical year and, you know, I root him on just like
anybody else.''
	   The attention _ however welcome _ is enough to make a Cardinal
shudder. ``Oh, man, it's going to be absolutely bonkers around
here,'' outfielder Brian Jordan said.
	   Reds manager Jack McKeon was more stoic. After all, the
Cardinals travel to Cinergy Field on Wednesday. And...
	   ``If he doesn't break the record, we'll see you guys in
Cincinnati,'' McKeon said, ``and we'll be asking the same questions
all over again.''

Venice exhibit showcases more than 600 Mayan works, some on loan

<TEXT>
	   VENICE, Italy (AP) _ A new exhibit at Venice's 18th-century
Palazzo Grassi showcases more than 600 artifacts showing some of
the finest work of Mayan culture, loaned by 40 museums in Central
America and around the world.
	   Many of the works are being loaned for the first time, revealing
the lives of princes, priests, warriors and workers from the
ancient civilization of Central America's tropical forests.
	   Getting the works together sometimes meant overcoming
considerable reluctance on the part of their caretakers, said Paolo
Viti, one of the organizers. Guatemala initially refused to send
one piece, a massive stone model of the city of Tikal, calling it
``too rare and precious.''
	   ``A few days ago, the minister of culture of Guatemala showed up
with it: It was too important and complete an exhibit to justify
such an absence,'' Viti told Rome's Il Messagero daily.
	   ``There is everything we hoped to have _ actually, even more,''
he said.
	   The line started forming two hours on Sunday's opening day.
Crowds thinned in the afternoon when people turned their attention
to the historic boat races on the Grand Canal, which the museum
faces.
	   The exhibit, ``Mayas: Spirits from the Other World'' runs
through Jan. 10.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India plans to change its law to provide
for compulsory death sentence to smugglers of high-intensity
explosives, a local news agency reported Monday.
	   Smuggling of explosives such as RDX and PETN is rampant across
the border with Pakistan, with whom India has tense relations. Both
nations have fought three wars, two of them over the disputed
territory of Kashmir.
	   Interior Minister Lal Krishna Advani said the 90-year-old
Explosives Act would be modified because of increased smuggling of
explosives, which are used by terrorist groups in India, Press
Trust of India news agency reported.
	   No date was set for amending the law.
	   A violent secessionist movement has raged for nine years in the
Himalayan territory of Kashmir, where more than 16,000 people have
been killed. Dozens of campaigns for greater autonomy have been
going on in the fragile northeast region, home to hundreds of
tribes, each with its own demand.

Leeds will reject any poaching raids on Graham
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEEDS, England (AP) _ George Graham will not be leaving Leeds
United to replace fired Tottenham manager Christian Gross, Elland
Road officials said Monday.
	   Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale said any offer to lure Graham away
from the club will be met with a definitive ``no.''
	   Tottenham fired Gross on Saturday, prompting speculation that
Graham was the No. 1 choice among potential candidates, including
England coach Glenn Hoddle and German striker Juergen Klinsmann to
take over.
	   Media reports indicated Tottenham would have to pay Leeds up to
6 million pounds (dlrs 9.84 million) in compensation if it managed
to convince Graham to go to White Hart Lane.
	   But Graham also rejected the speculation as rumor.
	   ``Every time a job comes up it seems my name is linked with
it,'' he said Monday.
	   ``But if you start believing everything you read, then you are
in trouble. I'm not going to give these reports any credibility by
commenting on them.''
	   Tottenham, which struggled to avoid relegation last season and
has lost two of its first three games this season, has not made an
official approach to Leeds, which finished fifth in the league last
season.
	   Meanwhile, Graham is focusing on Leeds' match against Premier
League strugglers Southampton on Tuesday.
	   ``We've been working very hard on the training ground. We've had
a good start and we want to see that continue against
Southampton,'' Graham said.

German soccer coach Berti Vogts steps down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS, UPDATES with more quotes, background &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ His position untenable under a growing
public outcry, Berti Vogts resigned Monday as coach of the German
national soccer team after eight years on the job.
	   The coach who guided Germany to the 1996 European title but
failed in two World Cup campaigns, said he was stepping down to
preserve any ``human dignity'' he still had.
	   ``I see no more possibility to carry on with the national team
with the necessary strength and concentration under so much public
pressure,'' Vogts said.
	   Vogts, who has been under heavy fire since Germany's
quarterfinal ouster at this summer's World Cup in France, quit
after a telephone conversation with German soccer federation (DFB)
chief Egidius Braun, the DFB said.
	   ``It hurts incredibly to carry out this separation. But as DFB
president, I had to realize that it had become unavoidable,'' Braun
said.
	   Vogts, 51, became coach in 1990, after Germany won its third
World Cup, in Italy under Franz Beckenbauer.
	   A former international defender known as ``the terrier'' with 96
caps and the 1974 World Cup title, Vogts had served as
Beckenbauer's assistant.
	   The DFB launched an immediate search for a successor.
	   Germany, the reigning champion, travels to Turkey for a tricky
European championship qualifier Oct. 10.
	   Among possible successors being mentioned in the German media
was Jupp Heynckes, who once played with Vogts on the highly
successful Borussia Moenchengladbach club.
	   Heynckes, who has coached a number of top German clubs, is
currently unemployed after being fired from Real Madrid despite
winning the Champions Cup last season.
	   He gained quick endorsement from Beckenbauer, the Bayern Munich
president who still exerts great influence in German soccer.
	   ``There is only one: Jupp Heynckes,'' Beckenbauer said. ``He has
no contract and he has enough international experience.''
	   Three other possible successors _ Christoph Daum of Bayer
Leverkusen, Otto Rehhagel of Kaiserslautern and Ottmar Hitzfeld of
Bayern Munich _ all have contracts with their clubs, which are in
European club competitions.
	   Even Beckenbauer himself was the target of speculation at a time
when German soccer is one of its worst slumps in years.
	   A private man who shunned publicity, Vogts endured severe
criticism after Germany's 3-0 loss to Croatia at the World Cup
quarterfinals this summer.
	   Resisting calls for his resignation, Vogts said he would stay to
rebuild the German team and attempt to defend the European title in
2000.
	   He promised to bring flair and creativity to the German team and
called eight rookies to replace the aging veterans who performed so
poorly in France.
	   In what was supposed to be a new beginning, Vogts took the
new-look team to Malta last week to practice and play two
exhibition games.
	   The trip instead turned into Vogts' downfall: Germany barely
managed to edge Malta, a soccer weakling, 2-1 and escaped with a
fortunate 1-1 draw against Romania in two appalling performances.
	   Stefan Effenberg, the ``enfant terrible'' recalled after four
years to spice up the dull German midfield, was a failure.
	   The players rebelled against the new zone defense Vogts was
trying to introduce and the coach was forced to revert to using a
sweeper, or libero, thus losing another chunk of his rapidly fading
authority.
	   Vogts returned home to face hostile headlines Monday.
	   ``Berti, how much longer?'' screamed a banner front-page
headline in the mass-circulation Bild newspaper.
	   Bild said television viewers at home ``were tortured with
horrible soccer.''
	   All major newspapers united in suggesting the only way out of
Germany's soccer crisis was for Vogts to resign.
	   The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung said ``the team has lost
confidence in their coach.''
	   The Frankfurter Rundschau said Vogts had become ``the symbol of
the downfall of the national team.''
	   A poll conducted for the RTL television network found 72 percent
of the Germans wanted Vogts to go.
	   Vogts was only the sixth German national team coach since 1923,
and only the second to lose his job, after Jupp Derwall in 1984.
	   His overall record in 102 games was 67 wins, 23 draws and 12
defeats.
	   Under Vogts' guidance, Germany lost in the final of the 1992
European Championship against underdog Denmark, was eliminated in
the quarterfinals of the 1994 World Cup by Bulgaria and won the
European title two years ago in England, Vogts' only major success.

NATO Gen. Wesley Clark visits Slovenia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ U.S. Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's
supreme commander for Europe, discussed plans for NATO enlargement
and the situation in the Balkans with his Slovene hosts on Monday.
	   Slovenia is in NATO's Partnership for Peace program. It was
excluded from the first round of NATO expansion this year, with
U.S. assurances its future membership will be considered.
	   The most prosperous of former Yugoslav republics and the closest
to Western Europe, it is eager to be seen as a part of the West
rather than the Balkans.
	   Clark met Defense Minister Alojz Krapez and the army's chief of
staff, Iztok Predbregar. On Tuesday, he will meet President Milan
Kucan and premier Janez Drnovsek.

Minister improving as questions on accident grow louder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with Defense Ministry saying minister still in
coma, other details. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The condition of France's interior minister was
improving, doctors said Monday, as questions grew louder about the
medical accident that landed him in a coma last week.
	   The nation's top daily demanded more detailed answers about
Jean-Pierre Chevenement's condition _ and about the precautions
taken before he suffered an allergic reaction to anesthesia,
causing a heart attack, then a coma.
	   Chevenement, a former defense minister and a key figure in Prime
Minister Jospin's leftist government, has been in a coma since last
Wednesday, when he entered the Val de Grace military hospital in
Paris for gallbladder surgery.
	   The 59-year-old minister suffered what was described as an
extremely rare reaction to a component in the anesthesia. It isn't
known whether he was tested for such an allergy in advance.
	   The hospital said in a statement Monday afternoon that
Chevenement's health had improved in the last 48 hours. But it
still didn't know what kind of lasting neurological damage he may
have suffered, or when he might be taken off life support.
	   It didn't mention the word ``coma,'' though a Defense Ministry
spokesman told The Associated Press the minister was still in a
coma. Still, the statement said, he was technically out of shock,
and ``all the vital organ failures are currently regressing.''
	   Yet to be determined were his precise neurological state, and
when he could be taken off life support, the statement added.
	   Doctors said last week that Chevenement was in a ``reactive
coma.'' But they have said subsequently it wasn't possible to
determine how much of a coma he was in, because he was heavily
sedated to cope with the effects of his treatment.
	   The nation's most respected daily, Le Monde, demanded in an
editorial earlier Monday that the government address the issue with
``total transparence.'' The elite military hospital is under the
aegis of the Defense Ministry.
	   ``To remain vague, to shelter behind secrecy _ be it medical,
military or state _ is the surest way of letting rumor take over,''
the daily said.
	   It said the information provided by hospital officials had been
inadequate, ``even if it is following the will of the family.''
	   According to the entourage of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, even
the prime minister feels that not enough information is coming out
of the hospital, the paper said.
	   ``We haven't been told anything about the procedures followed
with regard to this particular patient, in whose case ... one would
suppose that, even more than usual, all precautions would have been
taken to avoid an accident,'' Le Monde said.
	   ``When and how did the pre-anesthesia consultations take
place?''
	   As interior minister since 1997, Chevenement is in charge of the
nation's police and security forces. He is a key political ally of
Jospin.
	   He has, at times, been an outspoken critic of U.S. foreign
policy, especially during the Gulf War, when he resigned as defense
minister to protest France's involvement in the U.S.-led coalition
against Iraq.
	   He has been temporarily replaced by France's deputy minister for
overseas territories, Jean-Jack Queyranne.

One dead in violent crackdown on Cambodian opposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, new throughout. Trims. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's political crisis turned
violent Monday, as strongman Hun Sen launched a crackdown on his
opponents, blaming them for a grenade attack on his home.
	   One man was killed when military police fired hundreds of shots
into the air to disperse about 600 people gathered Monday evening
outside the luxury hotel where politician Sam Rainsy, the main
target of the crackdown, was taking refuge.
	   Hun Sen blamed Sam Rainsy, his longtime antagonist, for the
grenade attack, and ordered his arrest, describing him as a
``terrorist.''
	   The defiant crowd cleared the area in front of the luxury
Sofitel Cambodiana hotel, but later returned. The police staged
repeated charges into the crowd afterward, but they returned each
time.
	   A larger crowd of several thousand anti-government protestors
stood their ground a short distance away in front of the National
Assembly, where a round-the-clock protest over Hun Sen's recent
election victory has been taking place for the past two weeks.
	   The military police also unleashed a barrage of tracer rounds
into the sky toward them, wounding at least one person.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk on Monday night sent a plea to Hun Sen to
cease using weapons against the crowds, saying it ``makes the
political crisis more serious and further divides Cambodians and
pushes our nation to death.''
	   Sihanouk on Monday finished hosting three days of all-party
talks aimed at resolving the deadlock between the government and
the opposition, which claims it was cheated in the July 26 polls.
The talks, in the northwestern city of Siem Reap, had no positive
results.
	   Hun Sen on Monday morning issued orders for the anti-government
protests in the capital to be ended by midnight (1700 GMT) and for
the arrest of firebrand opposition figure Sam Rainsy, who has been
spearheading the protests.
	   Hun Sen said Prince Norodom Ranariddh, head of FUNCINPEC _ the
main opposition party _ could also be arrested. Hun Sen deposed
Ranariddh in a violent coup last year.
	   Ranariddh was believed to be at his residence in Phnom Penh.
	   Hun Sen, who has a reputation for political dirty tricks,
rejected speculation that he had staged the grenade attack to crack
down on opponents.
	   Police said no one was hurt when two grenades were thrown from
one or two passing motorcycles over the gates of his residence in
the capital. The only damage appeared to be a shattered window.
	   Hun Sen seldom stays at the residence, preferring his
fortress-like compound outside the capital. He told reporters that
family members, including his father, were not home at the time.
	   Sam Rainsy was taking refuge Monday evening at the Cambodiana
hotel, where the senior United Nations representative in Cambodia
has his office.
	   Through a spokesman, Sam Rainsy said he was under the protection
of the United Nations. His claim of U.N. protection could not
immediately be confirmed. His party said any arrest of Sam Rainsy
would violate an agreement Hun Sen had with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
	   The agreement allows opposition leaders who fled Cambodia
following last year's coup to return to freely contest the
elections.
	   The Sam Rainsy's party said it had no information about the
grenade attack.
	   ``The regime is using every pretext it can find to justify the
illegal and anti-democratic actions it seems to be preparing to
take against the peaceful political opposition,'' it said in a
written statement.

Bomb kills five in Algeria, following bloody weekend
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new bombing Monday, further scattered violence,
adds byline.
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A bomb exploded early Monday southwest
of Algiers, killing five people and injuring 11 others, the
security forces said. The explosion capped a bloody weekend during
which at least two dozen people died.
	   There was no claim of responsibility for the bombing near
Tiaret, 300 kilometers (187.5 miles) southwest of the capital. But
the hilly area is an Islamic stronghold. No further details were
immediately available.
	   Scattered violence over the weekend _ ranging from a train
bombing to a shootout in the capital _ claimed the lives of
civilians, Islamic insurgents and security forces, according to
reports Monday.
	   Two passengers were killed on the Algiers-El Affroun train line
when a bomb hidden under the track near Baba-Ali, just south of the
capital, exploded Sunday, medical sources reported. A third
passenger was injured, according to the sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Newspapers, citing witnesses, reported that up to five people
were killed.
	   It was the third time in a year that the same track was
targeted.
	   Inside Algiers, a 71-year-old man was reported killed by a stray
bullet during a shootout Sunday between suspected Islamic militants
and security forces at the Place des Martyrs, a main square near
the port and the ancient Casbah. Witnesses also reported that one
of the militants was killed and five others injured, including an
8-year-old girl.
	   Neither incident was officially acknowledged by security forces,
who provide only sporadic reports of the violence plaguing this
North African nation since 1992, when the army canceled legislative
elections to thwart a likely victory by Muslim fundamentalists. The
move triggered an Islamic insurgency.
	   Security forces killed 17 suspected Islamic extremists, 10 in an
operation early Sunday in Saida, 400 kms southwest of Algiers, and
seven Saturday in an operation in the Chlef region, 120 kms
southwest of the capital, inhabitants of the areas and medical
sources said.
	   In other weekend violence around the country, a merchant was
killed at a fruit market near Chlef, a farmer's throat was slit and
a member of the government-armed self-defense militia was
decapitated near Mascara in the west.
	   Much of the recent violence has been concentrated around
Tlemcen, near the Moroccan border to the west, but the summer
brought a resurgence of attacks to the Algiers area.
	   An estimated 75,000 people _ civilians, insurgents and security
forces _ have been killed since the start of the insurgency.

Greenpeace seizes waste loading installations

<TEXT>
	   LARYMNA, Greece (AP) _ Greenpeace activists on Monday seized
installations used by Greece's only nickel producer to ship waste
destined for dumping into the sea.
	   Activists took over the loading docks at a Larco plant in this
seaport on Greece's eastern coast to protest the company's dumping
of hundreds of thousands of tons of rust into the northern Euboean
Gulf.
	   Larco denied the waste was hazardous, sued Greenpeace, asked for
police protection and threatened further measures Tuesday if the
action was not stopped. It also said it had a government license
allowing it to dump.
	   ``First of all they are not toxic, and second they do not
pollute the sea,'' said Constantinos Daskalakis, Larko's chief
executive officer. ``Greenpeace's charge that Larco is polluting
Greek waters lacks any scientific base, is illegitimate.''
	   It was Greenpeace's second action against Larco. Over the
weekend, activists in rubber boats prevented a ship from dumping
waste in the gulf.
	   Greenpeace claims dumping rust into the sea affects marine life
and the long-term health of people who eat fish from the region.
	   It contends that Greek and International laws ban such dumping.
It alleges Greece was required to stop such dumping by the 1996
London International Agreement for the prevention of marine
pollution.
	   Daskalakis argued the London agreement does not cover Greek
seas.
	   ``Larco and the ministries of development, merchant marine and
health which have signed the dumping license, are violating both
Greek and international law,'' said Greenpeace spokesman Costas
Domvros.
	   He said Greenpeace took the action in order to force the
government to revoke Larco's dumping license.

Adversaries discuss forming new Northern Ireland government

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with talks end, comment from Trimble, Adams, Mallon
 &UR; With NIreland-Glance, NIreland-Funeral
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Protestant and Catholic leaders
opened discussions Monday on how to share power in a new
government, beginning another chapter in Northern Ireland's quest
for compromise.
	   Eight party leaders _ including Ulster Unionist Party leader
David Trimble and Gerry Adams, leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
party _ gathered at Stormont Parliamentary Building, within the
British government complex where they struck April's peace accord.
	   The talks concluded with no firm progress after less than two
hours, with Trimble describing them as ``workmanlike'' _ and
confirming that he talked directly to Adams for the first time.
	   ``There was direct, face-to-face engagement between everyone in
the room,'' said Adams, adding that there was ``no acrimony.''
	   Since being elected Ulster Unionist leader in 1995, Trimble had
refused to talk directly with Adams, arguing that the Irish
Republican Army needed first to start disarming as proof that it
had really renounced its violent campaign to destabilize Northern
Ireland.
	   The politicians' chief goal in coming weeks is to agree who
should form a 12-member administration, called the Executive, to be
drawn from the largest parties.
	   Most seats are reserved for Trimble's Ulster Unionists, chief
representative of the north's British Protestant majority, and John
Hume's Social Democratic and Labor Party, which gets the most
Catholic votes.
	   But Adams expects Sinn Fein to receive two Executive positions.
	   On Saturday, Trimble announced he would meet Adams later this
week to discuss terms for Sinn Fein's participation in government.
Also at that meeting will be Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of Hume's
moderate party, which has long competed with Sinn Fein for Catholic
votes.
	   Afterwards, Mallon described Monday's meeting as ``a first
tentative step.'' He declined to characterize the specific
exchanges between Trimble and Adams.
	   ``The attitude among all parties was cordial, and we got on with
the business,'' he said.
	   While April's agreement specified that the IRA should disarm
under international supervision by mid-2000, it set no deadline for
that process to start.
	   Before the meeting, Adams had emphasized it would ``run totally
contrary to the agreement'' if Trimble used the outlawed IRA's
arsenal as a way to block the legal Sinn Fein from taking its place
in the Executive.

U.S. ambassador meets Tudjman as U.S.-Croatian relations sink

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ U.S. Ambassador William Dale Montgomery
met President Franjo Tudjman on Monday as the State Department
harshly criticized Zagreb for its support of Bosnian Croat
hard-liners in next weekend's elections.
	   A terse statement from Tudjman's office said the two agreed ``to
do all to avoid unwise decisions that could deteriorate the
situation in Bosnia and harm the elections there.''
	   The statement did not provide details, but Montgomery likely
came to relay Washington's discontent with recent remarks by the
Croatian government.
	   Earlier Monday, State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
United States is ``extremely concerned'' by the actions of the
Bosnian branch of Tudjman's party and the government's comments
about Bosnia.
	   Rubin said the statements ``once again call into question their
commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia,
as well as full respect for implementation of the Dayton
agreement.''
	   The 1995 Dayton accord, which ended the Bosnian war, was
orchestrated by the United States and U.S. officials keep a
watchful eye on its implementation.
	   Tudjman signed the agreement on behalf of Bosnian Croats, but
international officials remain wary of his intentions. His
government aided Bosnian Croats throughout the war in what many
suspected was a plan to annex a part of Bosnia to Croatia proper.
	   On Sunday, Tudjman held an emergency meeting with leaders of his
party's Bosnian branch after international officials banned 15
candidates from running in upcoming elections.
	   Officials removed 11 candidates because members of the Bosnian
Croat army participated in various election campaigns. Four others
were removed because of biased election coverage by Croatia's
state-run television.
	   The Bosnian Croat Democratic Party, or HDZ, reacted bitterly and
threatened to boycott elections.
	   Tudjman said the ban could have ``incalculable repercussions''
on the elections and the peace process.
	   Rubin said the boycott threats ``only reinforce long-standing
suspicions that Bosnian HDZ and its associates in Zagreb seek a
pretext to withdraw from Dayton-mandated institutions and seek
separation from Bosnia-Herzegovina.''
	   The United States will ``continue to support those who support
the Dayton accords and will actively support those who seek to
undermine the agreement,'' he said.
	   The statement, perhaps the strongest to date directed at Zagreb,
reflects increased frustration with Tudjman's dealings in Bosnia.
	   Earlier this month, Tudjman resisted U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's requests to let Bosnian Croats act
independently. He said Croats in Bosnia feel imperiled and the
Croatian constitution obliges him to care for his compatriots.

Nigeria's military leader vows to end military rule
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GILBERT DA COSTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigeria's military ruler vowed Monday to
proceed with his country's transition to democracy, and said his
soldiers would stand behind the handover next May.
	   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, speaking to reporters in Nigeria's
capital, Abuja, also confirmed reports that investigators were
searching for money that disappeared during his predecessor's
five-year dictatorship.
	   ``I can confirm that routine audits and investigations of
various accounts in the office of the National Security Adviser and
other government departments ... are ongoing,'' said Abubakar, who
came to power in early June following the sudden death of Gen. Sani
Abacha. He denied, however, that a mass probe was underway.
	   Billions of dollars disappeared during Abacha's rule, much of it
into his bank accounts and those of his family, friends and top
governments officials. Abacha's national security adviser, Ismail
Gwarzo, has reportedly returned more than dlrs 250 million to the
state _ but is believed to have kept millions more. Gwarzo, who
worked very closely with Abacha, is believed to have been arrested
in early June.
	   Abacha's widow, Maryam, was reportedly stopped by authorities at
the airport in the northern city of Kano a few weeks ago, loaded
down with suitcases stuffed with cash. Authorities now reportedly
keep her under surveillance and have refused to let her leave the
country.
	   Abubakar, who welcomed Nigeria's warm reception by the outside
world during his three months in office, said he would travel soon
to New York to address the United Nations. He did not say, though,
whether he will meet with U.S. officials.
	   As for Nigeria's return to democracy, Abubakar insisted it would
go forward as planned. Presidential elections are to be held Feb.
27 and a new president is to be sworn in on May 29. He has said he
would not seek office.
	   ``The officers and men of the armed forces and police, like the
generality of our people, yearn for democracy in a united and
peaceful country,'' he said. ``They are overwhelmingly in support
of our democratization program.''
	   Accustomed to military coups, many Nigerians fear that despite
Abubakar's promises, the military will find a way to hold onto
power after the transition date.
	   Abubakar, while still viewed with suspicion by Nigeria's
political opposition, quickly set about changing course from his
predecessor. He freed political prisoners, met with international
envoys and pledged to restore civilian rule in Nigeria, which has
been ruled by military governments for all but 10 years since
gaining independence from Britain in 1960.
	   Abacha's corrupt and authoritarian regime left Nigeria
economically crippled and internationally isolated.
	   The last presidential elections, held in 1993, were annulled by
the military. Abacha imprisoned the apparent winner, millionaire
businessman Moshood Abiola, one year later.

Serbian government condemns EU ban, suggests no reprisal measures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Serbian government on Monday
condemned a new European Union ban against the Yugoslav national
carrier but suggested no reciprocal measures be adopted against
foreign carriers flying to Belgrade.
	   The government called the ban ``another sad example of
discriminatory and capricious'' acts against Yugoslavia and
``indirect support for terrorism in Kosovo,'' the state news agency
Tanjug reported.
	   The EU on Sunday said it would prohibit flights by JAT to its 15
member countries in response to the crackdown by Yugoslav and Serb
forces on ethnic Albanians fighting for independence in Serbia's
southern Kosovo province.
	   ``The ban has no rational or legal foundations... and is aimed
at harming the Yugoslav air company and citizens,'' the government
statement read.
	   The ban was forced upon the EU by ``certain politicians in the
German government,'' the statement said. It added that the Serbian
government will come up with a proposal to suspend the return of
Yugoslav asylum-seekers from such countries which discriminate
against Yugoslavia.
	   However, the statement added, any reprisal against foreign air
carriers would constitute an equally lawless measure and would go
against free trade and freedom of movement as advocated by the
Serbian government.
	   JAT was flying as scheduled Monday to several European
destinations. The independent Beta news agency said formal notice
of the ban had not yet been received.
	   European officials indicated the ban was expected to go into
effect Tuesday.

Court orders German far-right party to halt a TV ad slogan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ A state court ordered the Republicans
party Monday to stop claiming in a TV ad that founding fathers of
Germany's postwar democracy would now vote for the far-right party.
	   The North-Rhine Westphalia state court in Cologne ruled that the
ad violates the reputation of deceased politicians, and said it
would fine the party 500,000 marks (dlrs 292,400) if it did not
comply with the order.
	   The decision conflicts with another state court's ruling last
week forcing the SAT-1 network to honor the party's contract to air
the ad once nationally.
	   The Rhineland-Palatinate state court in Mainz, where SAT-1 is
based, said the TV ad violated no laws. The network, after
initially refusing to air the ad, relented after the court
decision.
	   The spot claims that the late Konrad Adenauer, Germany's first
postwar chancellor and then-opposition leader Kurt Schumacher,
``would vote Republican today.''
	   Adenauer's grandson, Michael Evert, filed a lawsuit in Cologne
claiming the ad infringes on the memory and reputation of his
grandfather. The Cologne court agreed.
	   The far-right party, which sought to compel other nationwide
networks to air the TV ad, was expected to appeal the latest
verdict.

Lawmakers reject Boris Yeltsin's choice for prime minister again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS, ADDS new quotes. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Crisis-Q and A. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin suffered blows on several fronts
Monday when lawmakers rejected his candidate for prime minister a
second time, throwing Russia into even deeper political turmoil as
the economy hurtles out of control.
	   The ruble crashed again dramatically and the Central Bank
chairman offered to quit. Some Russians flocked to stores to buy
goods before prices shoot up any higher.
	   ``The economic crisis is gaining momentum with catastrophic
speed,'' acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin warned the State
Duma before the lower house of parliament torpedoed his nomination
273-138.
	   ``We are all standing on the edge and no time is left for
settling scores,'' he said. ``We must begin acting.''
	   The vote sets the stage for a final confrontation between the
Russian president and his opponents. Yeltsin must decide whether to
nominate Chernomyrdin again, or find another candidate. If the Duma
rejects the Yeltsin's choice a third time, the constitution
requires the president to dissolve parliament and call new
elections.
	   Russia has been operating with an interim government for two
weeks, since Yeltsin brought Chernomyrdin back after firing him in
March. Chernomyrdin's efforts to win confirmation by parliament
have left him little time to devote to the worst economic crisis
since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   Both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin met with leaders of the
parliamentary factions at the Kremlin before the vote, but there
was no breakthrough with the president offering only a few symbolic
gestures.
	   The president suggested that the parliament confirm
Chernomyrdin, and then assess his performance after a ``trial
period'' of six to eight months.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said his party, the largest in
the Duma, would never accept Chernomyrdin. He complained that
Yeltsin was not interested in a real dialogue with parliament and
had not listened to opposition calls for an alternative candidate
for prime minister.
	   ``This is not a victory,'' Zyuganov said after the opposition
defeated Chernomyrdin. ``The country is in trouble.''
	   Chernomyrdin picking up 44 more votes than on the first vote
Aug. 31. He needs 226 votes to be approved.
	   The Communists and their allies say they have nine alternative
candidates, including several top Soviet-era bureaucrats. The
moderate Yabloko party on Monday suggested Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   Meanwhile, the Central Bank set the official exchange rate at
18.9 rubles to the dollar (or 5.2 cents each), down sharply from 17
(5.8 cents) on Friday. Deals that are to take effect on Tuesday
pegged the rate as low as 30 rubles a dollar.
	   The ruble was trading at about 6.2 to the dollar (16.12 cents)
when the crisis hit last month.
	   Trading in U.S. dollars was canceled on Moscow's currency
exchange because people wanted only to buy dollars, not sell them.
Street exchange points remained open and were offering to buy
dollars at around 20 to 22 rubles.
	   ``Everyone is waiting for the confirmation of the prime minister
and the announcement of a new economic program,'' said acting
deputy premier Boris Fyodorov. ``If there are no offers, the
(ruble) price can be anything.''
	   Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin, who has been widely blamed
for mishandling the crisis, offered Monday to resign.
	   Chernomyrdin is advocating an ambitious if somewhat unclear plan
to stabilize the economy within several months. He has also sought
to reassure Western governments and Russians that there would be no
retreat to a Soviet-style economic system.

	   American envoy John Shattuck said after talks with Milosevic
that the Yugoslav leader ``showed interest'' in letting independent
investigators look into evidence of war crimes and crimes against
humanity in the besieged Serbian province.
	   Shattuck and former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole met with Milosevic
following a weekend fact-finding tour of Kosovo, which is populated
mostly by independence-seeking ethnic Albanians. Both said they
were shocked by the destruction and human rights abuses in the
region.
	   ``What we have seen is massive destruction and horrendous human
rights abuses on civilians,'' Shattuck told reporters afterward.
	   He said the need for an independent investigation was urgent and
``crystal clear.''
	   ``We hope that willingness to entertain access to the region by
international forensic experts ... will indicate that (Milosevic's)
attitude is changing,'' Shattuck, the U.S. assistant secretary of
state for human rights, told reporters after the talks.
	   In an apparent effort to avoid some of the international
criticism, Milosevic's security forces on Sunday released most of
the approximately 500 men taken captive in the latest offensive
against the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army in Kosovo.
	   Milosevic also gave assurances that the International Committee
of the Red Cross would be allowed access to the captives. Shattuck
said he would insist that prisoners are treated according to
international standards.
	   Some of the released told reporters they had been beaten with
wooden sticks and complained they were kept in the forests without
food and water for 24 hours. Other area residents said 50 people
were still missing and 17 killed in the offensive.
	   ``They came and took us in the mountains,'' said Xhavit Rudi, a
30-year-old farmer who was detained near the village of Ponorac.
``They said they would cut us if we ate or drank or went to the
bathroom.''
	   Shattuck and Dole reiterated Western calls for an end to the
Serb offensive in Kosovo, where hundreds of people have died and an
estimated 265,000 have been driven from their homes. The two
demanded a pullback of government forces so refugees could return
to their homes.
	   But a statement from Milosevic's office after the talks
indicated he had no intention of stopping his crackdown. Milosevic
said ``terrorism in Kosovo will be suppressed and eliminated,'' and
called for international condemnation of the KLA rebels.
	   As many as 50,000 people left homeless by the fighting live in
the open in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main Yugoslav
republic.
	   Dole, who heads the International Commission for Missing
Persons, warned of an impending humanitarian catastrophe.
	   ``I wish I could say that we have some good news ... that we
found something encouraging,'' he said. ``I cannot. I was not
prepared for the damage and destruction.''
	   ``Americans and European leaders have pledged not to allow the
crimes against humanity which we witnessed in Bosnia to occur in
Kosovo. But such crimes are occurring,'' he said.
	   He warned that ``if images are transmitted around the world of
people freezing because they had been driven from their homes,
their homes burned and they don't come back from fear of police and
army, the repercussions will be dramatic.''
	   Milosevic and ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova
agreed last week on a U.S.-mediated framework agreement under which
they would negotiate self-rule for Kosovo. But the secessionist
rebels have not endorsed it, and are unlikely to if Serb forces
continue burning houses and shelling villages.
	   In the latest evidence of continuing clashes between Serb forces
and secessionist rebels, the ethnic Albanians' Council for the
Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms said Monday that 25 people
were killed in a three-day offensive by Serb security forces in the
Prizren region.

Johnny Herbert joins Stewart Ford
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILTON KEYNES, England (AP) _ Formula One racing driver Johnny
Herbert is leaving Sauber to team up with British-based
Stewart-Ford starting next season.
	   The 34-year-old British driver has agreed to a two-year deal
with Stewart-Ford, team boss Jackie Stewart revealed Monday.
	   ``As a British team, it's very nice for us to have a British
driver who has so much experience,'' Stewart was quoted saying in a
statement Monday.
	   Herbert, a veteran of 126 grand prix races, made his Formula One
debut with Benetton Ford in 1989 at the Brazilian Grand Prix and
moved to Tyrrell-Cosworth later in the season. He has also driven
for Lotus, Ligier and joined Sauber in 1996.
	   His most successful season was in 1995, when he won the British
and Italian Grand Prix and finished third in Japan enroute to
claiming fourth place in the World Drivers' Championship.
	   ``Joining Stewart-Ford is a fantastic opportunity for me. The
team, though still in its infancy, has already made a big
impression in Formula One,'' Herbert said.
	   ``I believe that with the chassis improvements I know about for
1999, and with Ford pushing ahead with its engine programme, I have
a great chance to help the team to the top of the Formula One
tree.''

Serb official banned; more Karadzic posters appear

<TEXT>
	   PALE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A hardline Serb official was
banned Monday from campaigning in Bosnia's upcoming elections,
while more posters of nationalist leader Radovan Karadzic appeared,
in violation of election rules.
	   International officials overseeing the weekend election to
choose leaders of Bosnia's various top government levels have
banned more than 25 candidates of various parties so far in an
attempt to set up free and fair voting.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
added Vojisal Seselj, leader of the Yugoslav Radicals, to the list
for inflammatory statements about the Bosnian political situation,
OSCE officials said Monday.
	   Seselj, from neighboring Yugoslavia, supervises the Serb Radical
Party in Bosnia, but was not a candidate in the election. The OSCE
ruled that his recent speeches ``attacked the territorial integrity
of Bosnia-Herzegovina,'' which it said violated the Dayton peace
accord as well as election rules.
	   In a letter to the president of the Serb Radical Party in
Bosnia, Nikola Poplasen, OSCE head Robert Barry said Seselj was
``excluded from any further participation in the election
process.''
	   OSCE spokeswoman Nicole Szulc said Poplasen didn't complain
about the decision. Party general secretary Ognen Tadic said the
party refrained from reacting to avoid further penalties that could
affect Poplasen's candidacy.
	   In another violation of election rules Monday, posters of
Karadzic, Bosnia's leading war crimes suspect, appeared in his
stronghold of Pale, 10 miles (16 kilometers) southeast of Sarajevo.
	   The Bosnian Serb member of the joint presidency, Momcilo
Krajisnik, met Monday with Barry in Pale to discuss the elections.
	   After the meeting, Krajisnik said his Serb Democratic Party
(SDS) did not tack up the Karadzic posters.
	   He insisted some other party had spread posters around Pale,
hoping the SDS would get the blame and be punished.
	   The OSCE already has banned two Bosnian Serb hardline candidates
for using Karadzic posters during a rally in the northern town of
Brcko.
	   ``It's going to happen again,'' OSCE spokesman Dardan Gashi said
of a possible ban of more candidates after hearing about the
appearance of new posters in Pale.
	   Karadzic led Bosnian Serbs into the 1992 rebellion against the
Muslim-led Bosnian government and headed the breakaway Bosnian Serb
entity during most of the 3 1/2-year war.
	   He has been indicted by the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal for gross
human rights violations, and the OSCE has banned all people
indicted for war crimes from any participation in the election.
	   Karadzic is believed to be hiding somewhere in the Bosnian Serb
half of Bosnia to avoid arrest by NATO-led troops.
	   The OSCE also has removed 15 Bosnian Croats from election lists
for various violations.
	   Most of them _ 11 _ were taken off because of the illegal
participation of the Bosnian Croat army in the election campaign.
	   Four others were removed because of what the OSCE called
persistently unfair election coverage from neighboring Croatia's
state-run television, which is broadcast throughout western Bosnia.
	   The main Bosnian Croat party, the Bosnian Croat Democratic
Union, or HDZ, reacted bitterly and threatened to boycott the
election this Saturday and Sunday.
	   Over the weekend, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman supported
his protegees in Bosnia, saying the banning of candidates could
jeopardize the peace process.
	   Tudjman backed Croat hard-liners in Bosnia throughout the war
that ended in 1995 with the Dayton accord.
	   Voters will choose leaders for Bosnia's two territories _ one
Serb and one a federation of Muslims and Croats. The three ethnic
groups fought the war for control of Bosnia-Herzegovina and now are
holding the third election under the Dayton accord.

Lithuanian parliament speaker calls for food aid to Kaliningrad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - Lithuania's speaker of parliament on
Monday called for the international community to prepare to send
food aid to Russia's Kaliningrad enclave, where food shortages are
worrying Russia's Baltic fleet is stationed.
	   ``Pending famine among the Russian navy should raise
international concern.'' Vytautas Landsbergis said in a statement,
noting that Russian commanders had said there was only a 40-day
stockpile of food for the forces.
	   ``It would not be a mistake to discuss matters with
international organizations and get ready for supplying food to the
civilians of that region, if need be,'' said the statement, quoted
by the Baltic News Service.
	   Kaliningrad, wedged in between Poland and Lithuania, is
strategically key to Russia, which has its only other access to the
Baltic Sea in the St. Petersburg area. Hunger among the forces
there could be a destabilizing event.
	   Landsbergis, the leader of Lithuania's independence movement and
noted for taking a hard line on Russia, said ``Lithuania would
probably manage to render part of such assistance in a friendly
manner.''

Palestinian security accused of beating Palestinian to death
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Palestinian man was apparently beaten to
death by a Palestinian security officers at a government office, a
Palestinian human rights group and the man's family said Monday.
	   The Palestinian Authority said it was investigating the death
Sunday of Hussein Abed Abu Ghali, 55, from the town of Khan Yunis
in the Gaza Strip, who was married and a father of 10 children.
	   Abu Ghali had gone to a Palestinian government office in Gaza to
ask the Palestinian Authority to intercede with the Israeli
government, which had refused to grant him permits to take his
16-year-old son to Jordan for medical treatment.
	   It wasn't clear what happened during his visit, but he was
pronounced dead later at Shifa hospital, where a doctor signed the
death certificate without an autopsy, the Palestinian Human Rights
Monitoring Group said.
	   The dead man's daughter Amina, 26, and his brother Omar said it
was apparent that Abu Ghali had been beaten, and that he had blood
and a bootprint on his shirt.
	   An entry in the hospital log, seen by The Associated Press,
listed the cause of death as ``a drop in blood pressure.''
	   The office of the Palestinian attorney general told the AP that
the human rights group had asked for an investigation, and that a
report would be made ``as soon as possible.''
	   Amina Abu Ghali said the family had asked the Khan Yunis police
to investigate the death, and said police had exhumed the body for
an autopsy.
	   The human rights group said the number of deaths caused by
Palestinian security forces was increasing, and called on
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to personally see that those
responsible for Abu Ghali's death were punished.
	   Abu Ghali's son Taha was severely wounded during violent
demonstrations in May to mark the ``nakba,'' or ``catastrophe'' _
Palestinians' term for their dispossession and exile after the
creation of the state of Israel 50 years ago.

Slovenia arrests Croatian citizen, suspects him of 1991 war crimes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Slovene authorities arrested a
67-year-old Croat on suspicion of war crimes stemming from
Slovenia's 1991 conflict with the Yugoslav army, Slovene radio
reported Monday.
	   The Croatian citizen, identified only as Vladimir B., allegedly
participated in the Yugoslav air force attack on the city of
Sentilj in June 1991. Several civilians were reported injured in
the attack.
	   State radio said the suspect, a pilot, was arrested recently in
the Maribor area of northeastern Slovenia.
	   Slovenia fought a 10-day war with the Serb-led Yugoslav army
after it proclaimed independence from Yugoslavia in June 1991. The
army eventually withdrew, but the Slovenia conflict was followed by
longer and much bloodier wars in Croatia and Bosnia.
	   In the old Yugoslav Federation, the army recruited from all
republics.

One dead in violent crackdown on Cambodian opposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with announced agreement not to clear demonstrators,
other details; edits to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBIN McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's political crisis turned
violent Monday, as strongman Hun Sen launched a crackdown on his
opponents, blaming them for a grenade attack on his home.
	   One man was killed when military police fired hundreds of shots
into the air to disperse about 600 people gathered Monday evening
outside the luxury hotel where politician Sam Rainsy, the main
target of the crackdown, was taking refuge.
	   Gunfire injured at least three other people.
	   The potential for further bloodshed appeared to have been
averted, however, with a last-minute announcement that officials
would not enforce a midnight (1700 GMT) deadline for the cessation
of anti-government street demonstrations.
	   Prum Sokha, an interior ministry official, announced shortly
before the deadline that there would be no arrests Monday night and
no further efforts to clear the protestors.
	   He said efforts to peacefully end the confrontations would
continue Tuesday.
	   He made the announcement after meeting at the Sofitel Cambodiana
hotel with United Nations officials and representatives of
opposition parties, who are staging the demonstrations to protest
what they say was Hun Sen's unfair victory in national elections
held on July 26.
	   Hun Sen on Monday morning blamed Sam Rainsy, his longtime
antagonist, for the grenade attack, and ordered his arrest,
describing him as a ``terrorist.''
	   Prum Sokha denied Monday night that any arrest warrant had been
issued for Sam Rainsy, but said authorities would invite him to
give information.
	   Sam Rainsy's supporters cleared the area in front of the
Cambodiana hotel after the three minutes of intense firing into the
air, but later returned. The police staged repeated charges into
the crowd afterward, but they returned each time.
	   A larger crowd of several thousand anti-government protestors
stood their ground a short distance away in front of the National
Assembly, where a round-the-clock protest over Hun Sen's election
victory has been taking place for the past two weeks.
	   The military police also unleashed a barrage of tracer rounds
into the sky toward them, wounding at least one person there.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk on Monday night sent a plea to Hun Sen to
cease using weapons against the crowds, saying it ``makes the
political crisis more serious and further divides Cambodians and
pushes our nation to death.''
	   Sihanouk on Monday finished hosting three days of all-party
talks aimed at resolving the deadlock between the government and
the opposition, who refuse to attend parliament until their
electoral complaints are investigated seriously. The talks, in the
northwestern city of Siem Reap, had no positive results.
	   Although Hun Sen won a majority, he is short of the necessary
number of seats to form a new government.
	   Hun Sen on Monday morning issued orders for the anti-government
protests in the capital to be ended by midnight and for the arrest
of firebrand opposition figure Sam Rainsy, who has been
spearheading the protests.
	   Hun Sen said Prince Norodom Ranariddh, head of FUNCINPEC _ the
main opposition party _ could also be arrested. Hun Sen deposed
Ranariddh in a violent coup last year.
	   Ranariddh was believed to be at his residence in Phnom Penh.
	   Hun Sen, who has a reputation for political dirty tricks,
rejected speculation that he had staged the grenade attack to crack
down on opponents.
	   Police said no one was hurt when two grenades were thrown from
one or two passing motorcycles over the gates of his residence in
the capital. The only damage appeared to be a shattered window.
	   Hun Sen seldom stays at the residence, preferring his
fortress-like compound outside the capital. He told reporters that
family members, including his father, were not home at the time.
	   Sam Rainsy was taking refuge Monday evening at the Cambodiana
hotel, where the senior United Nations representative in Cambodia,
Lakhan Mehrotra, has his office.
	   Through a spokesman, Sam Rainsy said he was under the protection
of the United Nations. His claim of U.N. protection could not
immediately be confirmed. His party said any arrest of Sam Rainsy
would violate an agreement Hun Sen had with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
	   The agreement allows opposition leaders who fled Cambodia
following last year's coup to return to freely contest the
elections.
	   The Sam Rainsy's party said it had no information about the
grenade attack.
	   ``The regime is using every pretext it can find to justify the
illegal and anti-democratic actions it seems to be preparing to
take against the peaceful political opposition,'' it said in a
written statement.

Some stores empty, others full as Moscow shows different images of
</HEADLINE>
crisis.
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Politics, BC-Russia-Economy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Alexander Morozov casts a despondent look down the
main hall of his supermarket, where a few cartons of milk and stray
packets of noodles stand out against otherwise empty, dusty
shelves.
	   Buyers cleaned out the store last weekend. In order to refill
the shelves, Morozov estimates that he will have to boost prices by
40 percent.
	   ``If I raise my prices that much, no one will be able to buy
goods,'' he worries.
	   Throughout Moscow, the need to raise prices, balanced by a fear
that shoppers won't be able to buy, is leading many stores to scale
back on imported goods and focus more on basic foods, especially
those made in Russia.
	   Morozov is working out a game plan for staying in business
during Russia's economic crisis. He says he will sell only dairy
products, meats, and grain, buying them a little at a time. He
admits it may mean goods will be sold out quickly, and consumers
may have trouble getting some products.
	   ``I can't sell imports because today the ruble is at 20 to the
dollar, and tomorrow it will be at 25,'' he says. ``If the
situation gets any worse, I'm going to have to close down
completely.''
	   Adding to the problem, Morozov said his wholesalers have already
stopped delivering some goods. They're waiting for the ruble to
stabilize before setting prices even on Russian goods, which are
also getting more expensive.
	   Despite the dreary outlook, other shop workers were more
sanguine Monday. With reliable suppliers, they are stocking up on
their normal goods even though prices are rising steadily out of
the price range of most Russians.
	   ``We'll always have the necessities,'' said Natalia Orlova the
head accountant of a small supermarket. ``But of course our prices
are up by 20 to 50 percent.''
	   Consumer attitudes about the price rises are varied, but few
appeared to be panicking. While some lined up to snatch up goods
still selling at old rates, others said they were buying no more
than usual because the latest price increases made stocking up
unrealistic.
	   ``Maybe we'll buy extra grains, but not much else,'' said Anna
Samoilova, a 29-year-old computer programmer. ``In the stores there
is no sugar, no oil, no grain. If groceries are still on the
shelves, they're at unspeakable prices.''
	   Many Russians struck a philosophical tone about the latest
crisis, resigned to the idea that they will lose money and
unwilling to scour the city for cheaper products.
	   ``This is nothing new for Russia,'' said Pyotr, an artist who
didn't want to give his last name for fear of government
retribution. ``I count on my personal strength. The best capital is
a man's health. If you lose your health, no bank account will help,
even in hard currency.''

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's political crisis turned
violent Monday, as strongman Hun Sen launched a crackdown on his
opponents, blaming them for a grenade attack on his home.
	   One man was killed when military police fired hundreds of shots
into the air to disperse about 600 people gathered Monday evening
outside the luxury hotel where politician Sam Rainsy, the main
target of the crackdown, was taking refuge.
	   Gunfire injured at least three other people.
	   The potential for further bloodshed appeared to have been
averted, however, with a last-minute announcement that officials
would not enforce a midnight (1700 GMT) deadline for the cessation
of anti-government street demonstrations.
	   Prum Sokha, an interior ministry official, announced shortly
before the deadline that there would be no arrests Monday night and
no further efforts to clear the protestors.
	   The deadline passed without incident.
	   He said efforts, 6th graf pvs.

Pakistan to debate nuclear test ban treaty in parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AMIR ZIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Under severe pressure from
international sanctions, Pakistan's government said Monday it will
seek a national consensus on whether to sign an international
treaty banning nuclear weapons tests, starting with a broad debate
in parliament.
	   The move was seen as a signal that the government, in principle,
was leaning toward signing the treaty.
	   Pakistan and India, which have fought three wars since 1947,
drew international criticism this spring when each conducted a
series of nuclear tests. Pakistan's economic crisis later worsened
when essential foreign aid and loans were cut off by the major
economic powers and international lenders.
	   Signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, often called the
CTBT, is a key condition for the resumption of international
funding Pakistan desperately needs to cover it dlrs 4.5 billion
balance of payments deficit.
	   Mushahid Hussain, minister for information, said the federal
Cabinet decided to hold parliamentary debate on CTBT in hopes of
building a national consensus on the issue.
	   State Minister for Foreign Affairs Siddique Kanju last month
said the signing of CTBT would not undermine Pakistan's nuclear
capability, but the nation would not succumb to economic pressure.
Kanju has also said Pakistan no longer tied its own signing to
reciprocal signing by India.
	   A senior government official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the Cabinet's powerful defense committee agreed
Monday in principle to sign the treaty, and that the parliamentary
debate was intended to build public support for the move. Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif government's expects fierce opposition from
the parliament's religious parties, which oppose the treaty.
	   The government official said the decision was made following
talks between Pakistan and the United States last month in London.
Major countries, including the United States, want a firm
commitment from Pakistan on the treaty before they resume aid.
	   A six-member team from the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank is expected Friday in Islamabad to discuss outside
economic support.
	   ``There is a pervasive sense of economic uncertainty, as the
government's decision concerning CTBT will determine whether
meaningful assistance from the West will be forthcoming,'' said ABN
AMRO Bank in its recent economic bulletin.
	   Pakistan is burdened with dlrs 32 billion in foreign debt and an
acute shortage of foreign currency. The government has said it may
have to suspend foreign debt repayments if the IMF and other
international donors did not restore loans.
	   The ABN AMRO report also said Pakistan's economic crisis was
more a result of postponing tough economic decisions and that ``The
nuclear tests have only served to expose the fundamental weaknesses
in Pakistan.''

Milosevic balks at Kosovo probe but will consider it, U.S. says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes from Shattuck, color, quotes from
Kosovo, statement from Milosevic &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic said
Monday he would consider an international investigation into
atrocities in Kosovo province but refused U.S. appeals to allow
immediate access to the region.
	   American envoy John Shattuck said after talks with Milosevic
that the Yugoslav leader ``showed interest'' in letting independent
investigators look into evidence of war crimes and crimes against
humanity in the besieged Serbian province, where hundreds of people
have died and an estimated 265,000 have been driven from their
homes in a crackdown on ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Shattuck and former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole met with Milosevic
following a weekend fact-finding tour of Kosovo, which is populated
mostly by independence-seeking ethnic Albanians. Both said they
were shocked by the destruction and human rights abuses in the
region.
	   Shattuck said the need for an independent investigation was
urgent and ``crystal clear.''
	   ``We hope that willingness to entertain access to the region by
international forensic experts ... will indicate that (Milosevic's)
attitude is changing,'' Shattuck, the U.S. assistant secretary of
state for human rights, told reporters after the talks.
	   In an apparent effort to avoid some of the international
criticism, Milosevic's security forces on Sunday released most of
the approximately 500 men taken captive in the latest offensive
against the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Milosevic also gave assurances that the International Committee
of the Red Cross would be allowed access to the captives. Shattuck
said he would insist that prisoners are treated according to
international standards.
	   Some of the released told reporters they had been beaten with
wooden sticks and complained they were kept in the forests without
food and water for 24 hours. Other area residents said 50 people
were still missing and 17 killed in the offensive.
	   ``They came and took us in the mountains,'' said Xhavit Rudi, a
30-year-old farmer detained near the village of Ponorac. ``They
said they would cut us if we ate or drank or went to the
bathroom.''
	   Shattuck and Dole reiterated Western calls for an end to the
Serb offensive in Kosovo, where hundreds of people have died and an
estimated 265,000 have been driven from their homes. The two
demanded a pullback of government forces so refugees could return
to their homes.
	   But a statement from Milosevic's office after the talks
indicated he had no intention of stopping his crackdown. Milosevic
said ``terrorism in Kosovo will be suppressed and eliminated,'' and
called for international condemnation of the KLA rebels.
	   As many as 50,000 people left homeless by the fighting live in
the open in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the main Yugoslav
republic.
	   Dole, who heads the International Commission for Missing
Persons, warned of an impending humanitarian catastrophe.
	   ``I wish I could say that we have some good news ... that we
found something encouraging,'' he said. ``I cannot. I was not
prepared for the damage and destruction.''
	   ``Americans and European leaders have pledged not to allow the
crimes against humanity which we witnessed in Bosnia to occur in
Kosovo. But such crimes are occurring,'' he said.
	   He warned that ``if images are transmitted around the world of
people freezing because they had been driven from their homes,
their homes burned and they don't come back from fear of police and
army, the repercussions will be dramatic.''
	   Milosevic and ethnic Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova
agreed last week on a U.S.-mediated framework agreement under which
they would negotiate self-rule for Kosovo. But the secessionist
rebels have not endorsed it, and are unlikely to if Serb forces
continue burning houses and shelling villages.
	   In the latest evidence of continuing clashes, the ethnic
Albanians' Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms
said Monday that 25 people were killed in a three-day offensive by
Serb security forces in one region.

Turkey says alliance with Israel should not be seen as threat

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Trying to assure Turkey's jittery neighbors,
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said Monday that his country's
growing military ties with Israel should not be seen as a threat.
	   His host, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, even suggested that
the alliance could grow. ``It is a cooperation barred to none,''
Netanyahu said in a welcoming ceremony for Yilmaz in Israel.
	   However, later Netanyahu backtracked from previous comments that
the Turkish-Israeli relationship could the basis of a regional
defense axis.
	   ``Perhaps the use of the word axis which I think was attributed
to me or used by me creates a false impression,'' Netanyahu said
during a press conference with Yilmaz.
	   ``We are talking about the most natural cooperation between two
countries of a region that want to contribute to the stability of
the region,'' Netanyahu said.
	   Turkey has publicly rejected the idea of creating such a
regional structure until Israel negotiates peace agreements with
its Arab neighbors.
	   Meanwhile, the Palestinians met with Yilmaz to voice complaints
over what they called repressive Israeli measures, and urged him to
consider a greater Turkish role in the Mideast peace process.
	   ``We told him that if the peace process fails, this will affect
not only here but also the entire Mideast and even Europe,'' said
Faisal Husseini, the top Palestinian official in Jerusalem.

Desert village destroyed, people killed in Niger floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NIAMEY, Niger (AP) _ Flash floods in this country on the edge of
the Sahara Desert washed away a village overnight and caused
serious damage elsewhere, resulting in a number of deaths, state
radio reported Monday.
	   An unknown number of people were homeless after up to 20
centimeters (7.8 inches) of water deluged parts of southwestern
Niger beginning late Sunday, destroying the small village of
Guecheme, about 300 kilometers (200 miles) east of the capital,
state radio said.
	   Other towns, including Dumega, the home village of President
Ibrahim Bare Mainassara which received 130 centimeters (5.1
inches), were seriously damaged by the rising floodwaters, state
radio said.
	   The heavy downpour was expected to continue on Monday night,
with more serious flooding expected, the state weather service
announced.
	   Some suburbs of the capital, Niamey, were being evacuated as the
deluge continued, government officials said in the broadcast. Water
services in the city were clogged and many people had begun
gathering the dirt-brown water flowing knee-deep through the
streets.
	   Health workers warned of the threat of water-born epidemics like
cholera.
	   The radio station said a number of people had been killed in the
inundation, but did not say where or how the deaths occurred.
	   Torrential rains occur sporadically during the wet season in
this vast arid West African country, causing rivers of water and
mud to rush across the barren soil.

Nuclear workers go on strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with strike at second location. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Workers at two Russian nuclear research centers in
the South Urals went on strike Monday to demand unpaid wages, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   ``Conditions indeed have become intolerable and socially
dangerous,'' said Vladimir Gorshkov, deputy union leader at the
Russian Federal Nuclear Center.
	   The center, one of Russia's two major nuclear weapons research
institutes, is located in the Ural Mountains town of Snezhinsk,
which was known as Chelyabinsk-70 in Soviet times.
	   Gorshkov said workers have not been paid for five months and
that some employees have been laid off. He said the government owes
240 million rubles (dlrs 11.65 million).
	   Workers also stayed off the job at the Research Institute of
Experimental Physics, formerly known as Arzamas-16, in Sarov,
ITAR-Tass said.

Coroner rules woman found after 21 years in lake was unlawfully
</HEADLINE>
killed &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BARROW-IN-FURNESS, England (AP) _ A woman whose bound and
weighted body was found in a lake 21 years after she went missing
was unlawfully killed, a coroner ruled Monday.
	   After a day-long inquest, coroner Ian Smith said he was not
implicating anyone in the ''nasty and vicious'' killing of Carol
Park, 30, dubbed the ''lady in the lake.'' She was bludgeoned with
a sharp instrument, probably with an ax.
	   Smith appealed for the killer to come forward. ``If this person
is still alive, which 20-odd years later they might not be, I hope
they have a conscience and I hope that conscience is troubling
them.''
	   Mrs. Park's brother Ivor Price and his family left the hearing
without commenting. But her husband Gordon, who was originally
charged with her murder but released for lack of evidence, said he
was glad ''that this ordeal for my family has now come to an end.''
	   Mrs. Park's body was found last year at the bottom of Coniston
Water in the Lake District, a popular tourist spot in northwest
England.
	   Gordon Park told the hearing that he left his wife, a school
teacher, in bed at their home in nearby Barrow-in-Furness on a July
evening in 1976.
	   He returned later to find his wife gone and their house locked
and empty. His wife's wedding and engagement rings had been left
behind, he said.
	   The couple's marriage had been strained and his wife had had two
affairs in the four years before she disappeared, Park said. On one
previous occasion, she left to live with another man, but later
returned to her husband and their three young children.
	   So on finding her bed empty, he told the inquest, his first
thought was ''Here we go again.''
	   ''I didn't know what was on Carol's mind, I just didn't know,''
he said.
	   Government pathologist Dr. Edmund Tapp said Mrs. Park had been
subjected to an ``horrendous'' attack with a sharp-edged weapon,
probably an ax, which had shattered the bones of her face.
	   Coroner Smith rejected any suggestion that Mrs. Park could have
died in an accident or committed suicide.
	   ``I am totally satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt Carol was
unlawfully killed and was the victim of a nasty, vicious attack on
her face. I believe she did put up her hands to protect herself and
was forlornly trying to defend herself,'' he said.
	   Smith said there was no clear evidence about where she had died.
Her body had been tied up in ``something of a frenzy'' in her own
pinafore dress and a series of bags before being dumped in the
lake, he said.
	   Last month police launched a fresh appeal for information to
help them catch the killer.

Lawmakers reject Boris Yeltsin's choice for prime minister again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Zyuganov saying Yeltsin to hold more talks
Tuesday. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Crisis-Q and A. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin suffered blows on several fronts
Monday when lawmakers rejected his candidate for prime minister a
second time, throwing Russia into even deeper political turmoil as
the economy hurtles out of control.
	   The ruble crashed again dramatically and the Central Bank
chairman offered to quit. Some Russians flocked to stores to buy
goods before prices shoot up any higher.
	   ``The economic crisis is gaining momentum with catastrophic
speed,'' acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin warned the State
Duma before the lower house of parliament torpedoed his nomination
273-138.
	   ``We are all standing on the edge and no time is left for
settling scores,'' he said. ``We must begin acting.''
	   The vote sets the stage for a final confrontation between the
Russian president and his opponents. Yeltsin must decide whether to
nominate Chernomyrdin again, or find another candidate. If the Duma
rejects the Yeltsin's choice a third time, the constitution
requires the president to dissolve parliament and call new
elections.
	   Russia has been operating with an interim government for two
weeks, since Yeltsin brought Chernomyrdin back after firing him in
March. Chernomyrdin's efforts to win confirmation by parliament
have left him little time to devote to the worst economic crisis
since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   Both Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin met with leaders of the
parliamentary factions at the Kremlin before the vote, but there
was no breakthrough with the president offering only a few symbolic
gestures.
	   The president suggested that the parliament confirm
Chernomyrdin, and then assess his performance after a ``trial
period'' of six to eight months.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said his party, the largest in
the Duma, would never accept Chernomyrdin. He complained that
Yeltsin was not interested in a real dialogue with parliament and
had not listened to opposition calls for an alternative candidate
for prime minister.
	   ``This is not a victory,'' Zyuganov said after the opposition
defeated Chernomyrdin. ``The country is in trouble.''
	   Chernomyrdin picked up 44 more votes than on the first vote Aug.
31, but was far short of the 226 votes he needed for approval.
	   Zyuganov said Yeltsin told the parliamentary leaders he would
meet with them again on Tuesday. He quoted Yeltsin as saying ``Vote
(on Chernomyrdin) and tomorrow we'll come back to the table,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Communists and their allies say they have nine alternative
candidates, including several top Soviet-era bureaucrats. The
moderate Yabloko party on Monday suggested Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   Also Tuesday, a parliamentary committee plans to submit a draft
motion to impeach Yeltsin, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. The
motion is an interim step in a long and complex impeachment process
that has little chance of passing.
	   Meanwhile, the Central Bank set the official exchange rate at
18.9 rubles to the dollar (or 5.2 cents each), down sharply from 17
(5.8 cents) on Friday. Deals that are to take effect on Tuesday
pegged the rate as low as 30 rubles a dollar.
	   The ruble was trading at about 6.2 to the dollar (16.12 cents)
when the crisis hit last month.
	   Trading in U.S. dollars was canceled on Moscow's currency
exchange because people wanted only to buy dollars, not sell them.
Street exchange points remained open and were offering to buy
dollars at around 20 to 22 rubles.
	   ``Everyone is waiting for the confirmation of the prime minister
and the announcement of a new economic program,'' said acting
deputy premier Boris Fyodorov. ``If there are no offers, the
(ruble) price can be anything.''
	   Central Bank chairman Sergei Dubinin, who has been widely blamed
for mishandling the crisis, offered Monday to resign.
	   Chernomyrdin is advocating an ambitious if somewhat unclear plan
to stabilize the economy within several months. He has also sought
to reassure Western governments and Russians that there would be no
retreat to a Soviet-style economic system.

Jalabert takes over as Tour of Spain leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ESTEPONA, Spain (AP) _ Laurent Jalabert of ONCE-Deutsche Bank
grabbed the lead in the Tour of Spain on Monday after the third
leg, the most competitive yet in the three-week cycling marathon.
	   The stage itself was won by Estonian rider Jann Kirsipuu of the
Casino team, who finished the 192.6-kilometer (120 mile) trek
between Cadiz and Estepona in 4 hours, 16 minutes and 24 seconds.
	   Second place went to Germany's Marcel Wust of Lotus-Festina, and
third went to Italy's Giovanni Lombardi of Telekom. Both were
credited with the same time as Kirsipuu.
	   The Frenchman Jalabert ousted Switzerland's Markus Zberg of Post
Swiss in the overall leadership of cycling's biggest race since the
scandal-marred Tour of France in July.
	   Zberg is now second, and France's Philippe Gaumont of Cofidis is
third.
	   Monday's leg saw constant movement within the pack, as well as
several breakaway attempts. In one of them, Spanish rider Juan
Carlos Vicario of Estepona-Brepac rode alone out front for 77
kilometers (48 miles) until the pack caught up and swallowed him.
	   The leg also saw the race's first serious injury when Italian
rider Paolo Lanfranchi of Mapei fell along with three other racers.
Lanfranchi was hospitalized with a head injury. The others were not
seriously hurt.
	   Tuesday's leg is a 173.5-kilometer (108-mile) stretch between
Malaga and Granada.

Lancashire clinches second cricket title in successive days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Lancashire clinched its second
English cricket championship within two days Monday when it beat
Hampshire by 16 runs at Old Trafford to claim the AXA league title.
	   Lancashire won the Natwest Trophy on Sunday with an emphatic
nine-wicket win over Derbyshire at Lord's and only needed to avoid
losing its penultimate limited-overs league match on Monday to grab
it second title.
	   Lancashire batted first and, after losing three early wickets,
recovered to set Hampshire 203 to win.
	   England batsman Andy Flintoff was the major contributor to the
Lancashire innings, scoring 69 runs off 58 balls, including three
sixes and six fours, in a 110-run partnership with Graham Lloyd.
	   Hampshire was restricted to 186 for seven in reply.
	   Hampshire, which needed a win to guarantee its place in the top
tier competition next season, lost both openers early but a 96-run
partnership between Robin Smith and Will Kendall put them back on
course.
	   Lancashire bowlers Glen Chapple and Peter Martin struck back
with crucial wickets and in the end Hampshire needed to score 40
runs in four overs to win. It could only manage 24 runs in the
final overs.

Germany gives Montenegro aid for Kosovo refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Germany has allotted dlrs 4.3
million to help Montenegro cope with the flood of ethnic Albanians
fleeing neighboring Serbia's war-torn Kosovo province, a statement
from the presidential cabinet said Monday.
	   The announcement came shortly after Montenegro's reformist
President Milo Djukanovic met with Wilfred Gruber, the German
ambassador to Belgrade, in Montenegro's capital Podgorica.
	   During the meeting, Gruber informed Djukanovic of his
government's decision to provide the sum equal to 7.5 million
German marks for sheltering and housing Kosovo refugees, the
statement said.
	   Montenegro's Red Cross officials have repeatedly warned of
refugee troubles in this tiny republic, Serbia's partner in the
present Yugoslav federation.
	   They published Monday the figure of 42,724 as the latest
registered number of displaced from Kosovo sheltered in Montenegro.
	   According to the International Red Cross in Geneva, the total
number of displaced Kosovo residents is estimated at 265,000.
	   Along with the daily influx of Kosovo refugees, Montenegro still
has to deal with more than 30,000 refugees it sheltered from the
wars in Bosnia and Croatia.
	   The U.S. top human rights official, John Shattuck, was due in
Podgorica on Tuesday to meet Djukanovic. The two are expected to
discuss humanitarian issues following Shuttack's tour of Kosovo
over the weekend.

third went to Italy's Giovanni Lombardi of Telekom. Both were
credited with the same time as Kirsipuu.
	   The Frenchman Jalabert ousted Switzerland's Markus Zberg of Post
Swiss in the overall leadership of cycling's biggest race since the
scandal-marred Tour of France in July.
	   Zberg is now second, and France's Philippe Gaumont of Cofidis is
third.
	   Monday's leg saw constant movement within the pack, as well as
several breakaway attempts. In one of them, Spanish rider Juan
Carlos Vicario of Estepona-Brepac rode alone out front for 77
kilometers (48 miles) until the pack caught up and swallowed him.
	   The leg also saw the race's first serious injury when Italian
rider Paolo Lanfranchi of Mapei fell along with three other racers.
Lanfranchi was hospitalized with a head injury. The others were not
seriously hurt.
	   Tuesday's leg is a 173.5-kilometer (108-mile) stretch between
Malaga and Granada.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Not only did King Hussein spend his 46th
anniversary as Jordan's monarch being treated for cancer in an
American hospital. Worse, gossip back home about his illness became
so frenzied that he had to deny rumors about who would succeed him.
	   The king's illness has set off deep worries about the future in
this small Middle Eastern country ruled by Hussein's family since
its founding in the 1920s as Transjordan.
	   ``This issue is as popular with Jordanians as the Lewinsky
affair with the Americans,'' legislator Mohammed Oueidi Abbadi
says.
	   Concern isn't limited to Jordan. The pro-American Hussein has
been a moderating influence in the region, and any instability in
Jordan would be a potential snag to peace efforts.
	   The king's hospitalization at the Mayo Clinic since July, his
second bout with cancer in six years, has brought talk of him
possibly stepping down.
	   Hussein, 62, named his brother Hassan as successor in 1965, but
rumors have spread of a change of mind. There also are rumors of
dissension over the issue in the royal family and of the
American-born Queen Noor maneuvering for her eldest son to be
chosen king.
	    &UR; Many people ... PICKUP 7th graf pvs.

Morning sickness made me a dragon, says Scary Spice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Pregnant Spice Girl Mel B _ Scary to the fans _
says she and similarly expectant Posh Spice Victoria Adams battled
to remain cheerful when morning sickness hit.
	   ''We both turned into dragons, it was quite funny,'' she said in
an interview with British Broadcasting Corp. radio, the first time
she has spoken about her pregnancy.
	   She was coy about plans to marry her boyfriend, dancer Jimmy
Gulzar, pointing out that the four-girl group has only just
returned from a successul American tour, ''so I haven't sorted it
out yet.''
	   ''We want to get married before Christmas but not this soon.''
Adams and fiance, Manchester United and England soccer star David
Beckham, plan to marry next year.
	   Scary told interviewer Jo Whiley that she knew ''in the first
week'' that she had conceived.
	   ''I am absolutely over the moon. I am three months and a couple
of weeks pregnant,'' she said.
	   Posh Spice was ''a couple of weeks ahead'' of her, she said.
``It is nice having a close friend going through the same things
you are.''
	   On cravings, she admitted to ``eating peanut butter nearly every
day and I have a thing for cheesecake and ice cream.''
	   The Spice Girls will be writing and recording their third album
through the final stages of her pregnancy. Scary said she also
plans to record her own solo album in the coming months.

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A Canadian navy submarine detected a
signal Monday believed to be from the second black box aboard
Swissair Flight 111, boosting investigators' prospects for solving
the mystery of the plane's crash.
	   Divers equipped with hand-held sonar searched at a depth of 190
feet (57 meters) for the cockpit-voice recorder, hoping to repeat
their success of Sunday when they retrieved the other black box or
the flight-data recorder.
	   That device was sent to experts in Ottawa who were trying to
determine if its condition was good enough to permit retrieval of
more than 100 types of information it is designed to record.
	   Together, the two black boxes could be pivotal in explaining why
the wide-bodied MD-11 crashed off the Nova Scotia shore late
Wednesday, killing all 229 people on board.
	   The voice recorder, if intact, would reveal other noises in the
cockpit besides the pilots' conversation with controllers, which
was released Saturday. That conversation was cut off 10 minutes
after the pilots reported smoke in the cockpit and six minutes
before the crash.
	   Divers also were trying to confirm that three large pieces of
wreckage found near the flight data recorder are sections of the
plane's fuselage.
	   Though officials have declined to give an updated figure of how
many bodies have been recovered, they have indicated that most
remain in the sea. Recovery of the fuselage could also lead to
recovery of many more bodies, officials said.
	   The Swissair plane, about an hour into its flight from New
York's Kennedy International Airport to Geneva, crashed 16 minutes
after the pilots reported the smoke and decided to attempt an
emergency landing. The plane started toward the Halifax airport,
but made two sharp turns as it tried to descend and dump fuel.
	   Swissair officials say the plane couldn't have made a direct
approach to Halifax because it was flying too high and was too
heavy with 30 tons of fuel.
	   The call was made 70 miles (112 kilometers) out of Halifax, but
the pilots would have needed 130 miles (209 kilometers) to make a
direct landing, Swissair said.
	   Alan Wolk, a U.S. pilot and aviation lawyer, said Sunday that
Flight 111's pilot, Urs Zimmermann, should have begun an direct
emergency descent sooner.
	   ``The MD-11 could have been landed overweight without
difficulty,'' Wolk said. ``We have learned from aircraft fires
historically that the only procedure that has a prayer of avoiding
an accident is the quickest possible descent and landing.''
	   Two relatives of one of the victims' echoed Wolk's opinion
Monday as they visited Peggy's Cove, the tiny fishing village
closest to the crash scene.
	   Cheryl Klein and her brother, Abe, whose father was killed, said
they blamed the pilot.
	   ``I think he wasted valuable time when he made that big circle
to dump (fuel),'' said Cheryl. ``I think he should have just tried
to land.''
	   Several hundred family members have come to the area to visit
Peggy's Cove, attend memorial services and assist medical teams in
trying to identify badly fragmented human remains.
	   More than 1,400 military personnel are involved in the search,
and more than 200 stress counselors have been assigned to support
them.
	   ``Some of the stuff they're being exposed to is truly
horrible,'' said Mary Anne Murphy, a Coast Guard spokeswoman.
	   At the Shearwater military air base near Halifax, relatives have
been invited to inspect personal effects found by the search team.
	   Claire Mortimer, 45, of Berkeley, California, said she went
hoping to find her stepmother's ring, and instead found the wallet
of her father, former New York Times executive John Mortimer.
	   ``It was a very wrenching experience,'' she said.

Ban on plastic bags sought in India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Alarmed that cheap plastic bags leach
toxic chemicals into food, clog drains and kill animals, a lawyer
has asked the Indian government to ban companies from making them,
a local agency reported Monday.
	   Plastic bags are recycled several times under primitive
conditions in mostly illegal factories in New Delhi. Government
enforcement of environment laws is lax.
	   In recent years, rag pickers who made a living collecting the
bags from garbage bins have stopped doing so following import of
high-quality waste plastic given free by companies in the United
States, Germany and many other industrialized nations where
recycling costs are high.
	   On Monday, the High Court in the capital asked the federal
government for its comments within four weeks on a lawsuit seeking
a ban on the manufacture of the plastic bags, United News of India
news agency reported.
	   Lawyer B.L. Wadhera filed the public-interest lawsuit, saying
the cheap bags contain chemicals such as cadmium- or lead-based
chemicals that are harmful to health. They leach into vegetables,
meat and food.
	   Given India's poor garbage collection facilities, tons of
plastic bags litter the roads, preventing rainwater from seeping
into the ground, Wadhera said in his petition.
	   Hundreds of cows die in New Delhi alone every year when they
choke on plastic bags while trying to eat vegetable waste stuffed
in the garbage bags, he said. Autopsies of cows in the capital have
found the stomachs of cows stuffed with as much as 110 pounds (50
kilos) of plastic. The animals die a slow, painful death from
convulsions, a recent government study revealed.

Another symbolic hurdle crossed as Belfast adversaries talk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS for AMs.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Long-time adversaries Gerry
Adams and David Trimble talked directly for the first time Monday
as politcians discussed how to share power in a new compromise
government for Northern Ireland.
	   Trimble, British Protestant leader of the Ulster Unionist Party,
had sat opposite Adams through eight months of negotiations that
concluded in April's peace accord _ without ever talking with the
leader of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party.
	   Trimble had threatened to maintain that frosty pose indefinitely
because of the Irish Republican Army's refusal to start disarming.
But Trimble relented after U.S. President Bill Clinton appeared
alongside him Thursday in Belfast and called for the IRA and
Northern Ireland's pro-British paramilitary groups to disarm under
terms of the accord.
	   Predictably, the disarmament debate dogged their first exchanges
Monday.
	   Trimble, who is to lead the new government, said he told Sinn
Fein delegates they wouldn't be eligible to hold positions in any
future administration unless they made progress on their
``particular responsibility'' of IRA disarmament.
	   Adams said afterward he had countered that every major party
held an ``automatic right'' to take part in the administration,
called the Executive.
	   He said April's agreement specified that the Executive should be
operating by the end of this year, whereas paramilitary disarmament
had a mid-2000 deadline.
	   Both sides appeared satisfied with the first proper contact
nonetheless. Trimble called the two-hour discussions among eight
parties ``workmanlike,'' while Adams said they had talked ``in a
good atmosphere and there was no acrimony.''
	   The meeting cleared the way for several more intensive meetings
this week involving Trimble, moderate Catholic politician Seamus
Mallon and individual pro-agreement parties.
	   Trimble and Mallon are expected to meet Sinn Fein on Thursday.
Trimble has already emphasized he will not shake Adams' hand in
public or private.
	   If the Executive is appointed, its members would gradually take
power away from the British government, which has directly run
Northern Ireland since abolishing a Protestant-dominated government
in 1972. Northern Ireland's 77-year-old political union with
Britain would remain, however.
	   Any proposed Executive must be approved by majorities of both
British Protestants and Irish Catholics in the Assembly, the new
108-seat legislature elected in June from which the Executive is
being drawn.
	   So far, that Assembly has met just once, on July 1, to appoint
Trimble and Mallon to be the joint figureheads for the future
Executive. It will meet again next Monday.
	   While the 42-seat Catholic bloc, including 18 Sinn Fein members,
is certain to approve any compromise administration, the Protestant
side of the house is split down the middle.
	   Trimble leads a 30-strong voting bloc, among them many who might
rebel if he moves too quickly.
	   Ranged against Trimble are 28 Protestant diehards from the Rev.
Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists and the smaller, equally
stubborn United Kingdom Unionists. They boycotted Monday's
discussions because Sinn Fein was there but, like Sinn Fein,
Paisley is demanding two Executive seats for his party.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Amanda Coetzer slammed a backhand passing shot
down the line on match point to survive a marathon third-round
match at the U.S. Open on Monday and upset seventh-seeded Conchita
Martinez 6-4, 4-6, 6-2.
	   With both Coetzer, the No. 13 seed from South Africa, and
Martinez playing behind the baseline and occasionally engaging in
moonball rallies, the match took 2 hours, 39 minutes, to play. One
game had 28 points, including 11 deuces, and consumed 20 minutes,
25 seconds.
	   The victory put Coetzer into the quarterfinals, where she will
play the winner of a match later Monday between No. 2 Lindsay
Davenport and No. 10 Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Martinez, a Spaniard who won Wimbledon in 1994 and reached the
Australian Open in January, took a medical timeout and had her
right shoulder worked on after the first game of the second set. It
was then she and Coetzer battled through the longest game of this
year's competition.

	   McGwire hit a 1-1 pitch off the club level at Busch Stadium, a
drive estimated at 430 feet (131 meters) and truly worthy of
pulling even with Maris' record.
	   The crowd stood in unison while the St. Louis Cardinals first
baseman held both arms wide and high as he approached first base.
Security officers immediately came on the field, while McGwire's
10-year-old son, Matthew, was waiting at home plate, was lifted by
his father and got a big hug.
	   Maris' family, watching from seats on the first-base side,
applauded, too.
	   McGwire had 18 games remaining to set his own record, so the
main suspense is whether he could hold off Sosa _ who fouled out to
McGwire in his first at-bat.
	   Maris hit his 61st homer on the last day of the same 162-game
season, while Ruth accomplished his feat in the final game of a
154-game schedule.

	   When Sosa came to the plate in the top half, the crowd _ clad
mostly in Cardinals red _ saluted the Cubs' slugger with a standing
ovation, quite a tribute considering the the longstanding rivalry
between the teams.
	   Sosa tipped his hat to the crowd and gave his trademark
two-finger salute to McGwire, holding the runner at first.
	   The crowd wasn't as loud when McGwire, batting third in the
Cardinals order, stepped up in the bottom of the inning with two
outs. Out in right field, Sosa clapped his right hand against his
glove.
	   Three pitches later, the scene turned into bedlam. After missing
the first pitch and taking a ball, McGwire sent the ball hurtling
toward the left-field stands. A day earlier, a McGwire drive had
taken a similar path but hooked foul by about 7 feet (2 meters).
	   This time, there was no doubt.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Boca Juniors used a convincing
6-2 weekend victory to stay atop the Argentine first division,
along with Velez Sarsfield and Union.
	   The three teams remain tied for the top standings spot with 11
points each. Velez beat Rosario Central 2-1, earning three points
with the win and Union blanked Racing 1-0 in other Sunday action.
	   Boca's victory, its most lopsided of the year, came on the
strength of two goals by Martin Palermo, who after five games is
the league's leading scorer with six goals.
	   Boca's chief rival, River Plate, continued to struggle, losing
3-1 to Talleres. It was River's third straight loss as they look to
next week to climb out of the bottom of the first division.
	   The return of Marcelo Gallardo did little to boost the sagging
play of River.
	   Newell's Old Boys could tie Boca Juniors, Velez and Union for
the league's top spot with a victory Monday night against Ferro.

McGwire hits 61st homer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL NEWBERRY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire reached one of baseball's most
revered records Monday, hitting his 61st homer against the Chicago
Cubs to tie Roger Maris' 37-year-old mark.
	   McGwire's first-inning drive off Mike Morgan was his seventh in
seven games and 15th in 20 days. The St. Louis Cardinals' first
baseman pushed himself three homers ahead of Sammy Sosa, whose Cubs
began a two-game series at Busch Stadium.
	   Only three players in North American baseball history have hit
60 or more homers in a season. Babe Ruth had 60 in 1927, a record
that stood until Maris hit 61 in 1961.
	   McGwire hit a 1-1 pitch off the club level at Busch Stadium, a
drive estimated at 430 feet (131 meters) and truly worthy of
pulling even with Maris' record.
	   The crowd stood while the St. Louis Cardinals first baseman held
both arms wide and high as he approached first base. Security
officers immediately came on the field, while McGwire's 10-year-old
son, Matthew, waiting at home plate, was lifted by his father into
a big hug.
	   Maris' family applauded from their seats on the first-base side.
	   McGwire had 18 games remaining to set his own record, so the
main suspense is whether he can hold off Sosa _ who fouled out to
McGwire in his first at-bat.
	   Maris hit his 61st homer on the last day of the same 162-game
season, while Ruth accomplished his feat in the final game of a
154-game schedule.
	   When Sosa came to the plate in the top half, the crowd _ clad
mostly in Cardinals red _ saluted the Cubs' slugger with a standing
ovation, quite a tribute considering the the longstanding rivalry
between the teams.
	   Sosa tipped his hat to the crowd and gave his trademark
two-finger salute to McGwire, holding the runner at first.
	   The crowd wasn't as loud when McGwire, batting third in the
Cardinals order, stepped up in the bottom of the inning with two
outs. Out in right field, Sosa clapped his right hand against his
glove.
	   Three pitches later, the scene turned into bedlam. After missing
the first pitch and taking a ball, McGwire sent the ball hurtling
toward the left-field stands. A day earlier, a McGwire drive had
taken a similar path but hooked foul by about 7 feet (2 meters).
	   This time, there was no doubt.
	   McGwire entered the game 1-for-6 in his career against Morgan, a
38-year-old right-hander acquired by the Cubs from Minnesota on
Aug. 25. Big Mac has now hit five homers against Chicago this
season.
	   Before Monday, Sosa and McGwire had homered twice in the same
game. Twenty times in this remarkable season, they've homered on
the same day.
	   St. Louis has 11 games left this year at Busch Stadium, where
McGwire has 31 homers, shattering the previous season record of 17.
	   McGwire has 85 homers, 170 RBIs and 190 walks in 186 career
games with the Cardinals, who acquired him from Oakland on July 31,
1997.

Party calls for allowing more private investment in energy sector
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A major opposition party has called for
easing Mexico's tight limits on private and foreign investment in
its oil and energy industries.
	   ``We have to look for ways to make these state-run agencies
become more efficient,'' said Carlos Medina Plascencia,
congressional leader of the National Action Party, during a news
conference outling proposed changes to Petroleos Mexicanos and the
Federal Electricity Commission.
	   To allow more private investment, National Action proposed
revising laws that enforce the constitutional clause that gives the
state exclusive rights over Mexico's resources.
	   Government ownership of the oil industry and most other parts of
the energy sector has been a nearly sacred principle of Mexican
politics since 1938, when revered President Lazaro Cardenas
nationalized foreign-owned oil companies.
	   Congressman Rogelio Sada did not say whether his party's
proposal would allow total ownership of petrochemical plants by
foreign investors.
	   ``We have not yet established our position, but we want it to be
a part of the debate,'' Sada said.
	   Medina said it would be necessary to reach an agreement with the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party on the issue. The
leftist Democratic Revolution Party has opposed easing controls on
energy ownership.
	   State control of the energy sector caused the state oil company,
Pemex, to grow into a bloated and inefficient company running
obsolete plants. In the 1980s, a series of drastic reforms laid off
thousands of workers and opened investment in some peripheral
sectors of the energy industry.
	   But further reforms by market-oriented officials have been
repeatedly frustrated by nationalist sentiment against easing
federal control of natural resources.
	   The government said three years ago that it would sell a
49-percent stake in what it classified as secondary petrochemicals.
	   But investors have been wary of putting money into joint
ventures in which government officials call the shots.
	   ``The plan to sell a 49 percent stake has not been successful,''
Medina said.

Hundreds flock to Spanish toad as no-cost Viagra substitute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALCALA DE LA SELVA, Spain (AP) _ With torches lighting their way
in the dark of night, hundreds of people climbed a hillside to pay
homage to a giant toad that is this town's answer to Viagra.
	   The toad is a rock formation, five meters high by five meters
wide (17 feet by 17 feet), overlooking this mountain hamlet of 500
souls in eastern Spain's Teruel province.
	   Legend has it that if you touch the creature three times _no
need to kiss it _ under a full moon, great things will happen in
every room of the house.
	   As a full moon rose over Alcala de la Selva on Sunday night,
pilgrims came from all over, marching up in the hill in a
single-file procession. Mayor Benito Ros estimated the turnout at
up to 1,000.
	   ``We had tons of people,'' Ros said. ``Fortunately, the rock is
large, so many people can touch it at the same time.''
	   The toad is supposed to be all-powerful, helping people win the
lottery, say, or pass a civil service exam, or, of course, put zing
back into their love life.
	   Ros says the story's been around for a long time _ nobody really
knows how long _ and was nearly forgotten, except by old-timers.
But now the toad's been dusted off and re-embraced as a
tongue-in-cheek rival to the sexual potency drug Viagra.
	   Does anybody really believe in the toad? ``Some do, some
don't,'' he says. ``A lot take it as a joke.''
	   Still, although it may be psychosomatic, some people actually
report experiencing fresh sexual zip after touching the toad _ with
none of Viagra's side effects, the mayor says.
	   Ros, 47, admitted that he, too, touched the toad, but just for
good luck. ``I have four children. I don't need any more
fertility.''

Mexico's president shown in old photos being beaten by police
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo MO1 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ As Mexicans mark the 30th anniversary of
student protests that shook the country, a newspaper on Monday
published photos showing President Ernesto Zedillo as a youth
apparently being beaten by police.
	   The president acknowledged that he was the 16-year-old student
pictured in photos taken during demonstrations in July 1968.
	   The Mexico City newspaper El Universal reported it discovered
the two photos in its archives. One of the photos, showing a
soldier appearing to beat a young man who is backed against a wall,
was published at the time.
	   The other, showing Zedillo arguing with five armed soldiers, was
never before published.
	   The president told El Universal that the images were indeed of
him. He said he had belonged to a moderate student group named for
Emiliano Zapata _ a famed Mexican revolutionary _ and participated
in the student movement that challenged Mexico's rulers.
	   ``I was a moderate student, but despite that the riot police
sprayed us with blows,'' El Universal quoted Zedillo as saying in
1994.
	   The student demonstrations culminated in a huge protest in
Tlatelolco Square on Oct. 2, 1968, in which police and soldiers
opened fire on the students, killing at least 300 protesters.
Zedillo was not at that event.
	   Many Mexican historians consider the shock of the massacre to be
a turning point in Mexican political life, discrediting the
government while sending a few young Mexicans into guerrilla
rebellion and many more into pro-democracy activities.
	   Zedillo himself has credited the 1968 student movement with
beginning a process in which Mexico has become more democratic.

Defense in tourist slaying trial wants to question survivor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The lawyer for a former Israeli paratrooper who
confessed to fatally shooting a British tourist and wounding his
girlfriend asked Monday that the woman be brought to Israel to
testify.
	   Daniel Okev, 45, is charged in the slaying of Jeffrey Hunter,
22, and the wounding of Charlotte Gibb, also then 22, in August
1997.
	   The two were hitchhiking in southern Israel when Okev picked
them up. He stopped at an isolated spot in the desert and shot them
both with a pistol.
	   Okev claimed his actions were the result of trauma caused by his
service in an Israeli special forces squad code-named ``Rimon'' _
Hebrew for pomegranate and also for grenade. The unit hunted down
and executed suspected Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip in
the early 1970s.
	   Okev's lawyer David Yiftach says Ofek is not competent to stand
trial, and argued he has ``diminished responsibility'' due to his
mental condition.
	   At a session Monday in Beersheba District Court, Yiftach asked
that Gibb be brought to Israel so he can question her in open
court. Presiding Judge Yehoshua Pilpel said this could be extremely
distressing for the woman, and gave Yiftach three days to consider
whether he really wanted Gibb called.
	   ``If I insist, the prosecution has no choice but to bring her,''
the lawyer told The Associated Press.
	   Meanwhile, a prosecution psychiatrist who testified Sunday that
Ofek was competent to stand trial admitted Monday under
cross-examination that Ofek's action could have been caused by an
incident he experienced during the 1973 Mideast war, the defense
said.
	   Ofek's gun once jammed as he tried to open fire on five Egyptian
commandos, and he survived only because his companions shot them as
he was trying desperately to fix the weapon.
	   Both the wartime incident and the shooting of the two tourists
occurred at night, in the desert.
	   The next court hearing is scheduled for October 25.

Guatemalan villagers lynch three accused robbers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Villagers lynched and burned two women and
a man accused of robbing a house and injuring three people with
gunfire as they attempted to flee, police said Monday.
	   Police said villagers in Santa Lucia Utatlan, some 50 miles (80
kilometers) west of the capital, found the three in the act of
robbing a house on Sunday and chased them. As they fled, the
suspects fired at their pursuers, wounding three.
	   The crowd caught them, beat them to death and then set their
bodies on fire before police could intervene.
	   The victims of the lynching were identified as Rosario Morales,
33, Zoila Perez y Perez, 20, and William Morales, 38.
	   Guatemala has seen numerous lynchings in recent years by
villagers fed up with crime.
	   Last week, a mob of some 3,000 people in Quebrada Seca in Alta
Verapaz province killed three alleged criminals.

Cyprus Bishop in trouble with government over land sale
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HAMZA HENDAWI &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ A Cabinet minister called Monday on the
Cyprus Greek Orthodox Church to return money it had allegedly
overcharged the state's Electricity Authority in a land deal, and,
in unusually blunt remarks, suggested that the church had more
money than it needed.
	   If the money was not returned, threatened Commerce Minister
Nicos Rolandis, the government would deduct the sum from the
state's 1.7 million-pound (dlrs 3.29 million) deal between the
Electricity Authority and Bishop Chrysanthos of the southern port
city of Limassol.
	   ``We (the government) already give them more than they should be
getting and we are not going to give them more money than they
should be getting and we are not going to give them more than
that,'' said Rolandis.
	   Bishop Chrysanthos, responding to the minister, said he had no
intention to return the money. ``The Bishopric made an offer. It
was accepted and it was legal, therefore, there is no problem.
	   ``Returning the money is not an issue,'' he told reporters in
Limassol, where the land was bought in April 1997 for the
Electricity Authority to build its headquarters in the city.
	   The tussle between Rolandis and the Limassol Bishop is the
latest chapter in a string of spectacular and intensely publicized
allegations linking Chrysanthos to financial fraud and investment
scams involving millions of dollars and stretching from Latin
America to Portugal and Britain.
	   The bishop, who has strongly denied the allegations, is under
investigation by the Cypriot police, a committee appointed by the
church and Scotland Yard, the detective department of the London
police force.
	   The accusations against him have made headlines and led radio
and television news bulletins virtually every day for the past four
weeks. They have also led to calls by some members of Parliament
for a legislation to control the financial dealings and business
activities of the Church, the island's biggest land owner whose
investments are estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of
dollars.
	   The controversy has also renewed the debate on whether the
church has gone too far in the pursuit of wealth at the expense of
its spiritual role. The overwhelming majority of Cypriots are Greek
Orthodox Christians.
	   The island's Electricity Authority has promised to respond to
charges of negligence made by Rolandis in connection with the land
deal before a Cabinet meeting scheduled for Tuesday.
	   The authority is believed to have been overcharged by 600,000 to
700,000 pounds (dlrs 1.16 million to dlrs 1.35 million) for the
land.
	   Rolandis has accused the authority of accepting the church's bid
on face value rather than carrying out its own estimate of the land
value. ``It's clear there was negligence in this matter, because
the land was bought without following the procedure of having it
valued.
	   ``The point that bothers me is how the Cyprus Republic can get
this money back. So, I am asking the Bishopric to return this
money, because it is clear it doesn't belong to them,'' Rolandis
said.

McGwire hits 61st homer

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire reached one of North American
baseball's most revered records Monday, hitting his 61st homer
against the Chicago Cubs to tie Roger Maris' 37-year-old mark.
	   McGwire's first-inning drive off Mike Morgan came in the 145th
game for the St. Louis Cardinals, eliminating any need for an
asterisk _ Maris' fate when he broke Ruth's record in 1961 when he
broke the record in a substantially longer season.
	   McGwire's drive, which came on a 1-1 pitch, was estimated at 430
feet (130 meters). The crowd stood in unison while the St. Louis
Cardinals first baseman held both arms wide and high as he
approached first base and high five from the Cubs' Mark Grace.
	   Security officers immediately came onto the field, while
McGwire's 10-year-old son, Matthew, was waiting at home plate, was
lifted by his father and got a big hug.
	   Maris' family, watching from seats on the first-base side,
applauded, too, as did Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa, who entered the
game with 58 homers.
	   McGwire's drive slammed off the facade of the stadium club _ the
third deck at Busch Stadium _ and fell into the packed stands
below. Mike Davidson, a 28-year-old from St. Louis, wound up with
it after it deflected off the hands of three other people.
	   ``They are my brother-in-law's seats,'' Davidson said. ``He gave
them to me because he had to work today.''
	   Davidson said he planned to give the ball to McGwire and
wouldn't ask for anything in return.
	   McGwire had 18 games remaining to set his own record, so the
main suspense is whether he could hold off Sosa _ who fouled out to
McGwire in his first at-bat and was called out on strikes when he
came up in the third.
	   Only three players have hit 60 or more homers in a season. Babe
Ruth had 60 in 1927, a record that stood until Maris hit 61 in
1961.
	   Maris hit his 61st homer on the last day of a season scheduled
for 162 games, drawing an asterisk in the record book that stood
until it was removed in the early 1990s _ after Maris' death.
	   Ruth accomplished his feat in the Yankees' next-to-last game of
a season scheduled for 154 games.
	   McGwire's first chance to break Maris' record came in the third
inning, when he singled sharply past former teammate Gary Gaetti at
third. After the 61st homer, Gaetti high-fived McGwire as he was
making the final turn toward home.
	   On the last step of his trot, McGwire hopped on the plate with
both feet for emphasis. He saluted the crowd, hailed Sosa in right
and appeared to give a gesture toward the family of Maris, who died
in 1985.
	   The first fan to get his hand on the ball was Rich Reichert, 32,
of St. Louis. But he couldn't hang on and cut his left ring finger
as he tumbled to the concrete.
	   ``After the ball bounced off my hands, it was a little bit of a
blur,'' Reichert said. ``All I know was I got knocked down by about
10 guys.''
	   When Sosa came to the plate in the top half of the first, the
crowd _ clad mostly in Cardinal red _ saluted the Cubs' slugger
with a standing ovation, quite a tribute considering the
longstanding rivalry between the teams.
	   Sosa tipped his hat to the crowd and gave his trademark
two-finger salute to McGwire, holding a runner at first.
	   The crowd wasn't as loud when McGwire, batting third in the
Cardinals order, stepped up in the bottom of the inning with two
outs. Out in right field, Sosa clapped his right hand against his
glove.
	   Three pitches later, the scene turned into bedlam. After missing
the first pitch and taking a ball, McGwire sent the ball hurtling
toward the left-field stands. A day earlier, a McGwire drive had
taken a similar path but hooked foul by about 7 feet (2 meters).
	   This time, there was no doubt.
	   McGwire entered the game 1-for-6 in his career against Morgan, a
38-year-old right-hander acquired by the Cubs from Minnesota on
Aug. 25. Big Mac has now hit five homers against Chicago this
season.
	   Before today, Sosa and McGwire had homered twice in the same
game. Twenty times in this remarkable season, they've homered on
the same day.
	   St. Louis has 11 games left this year at Busch Stadium, where
McGwire has 31 homers, shattering the previous season record of 17.
	   McGwire has 85 homers, 170 RBIs and 190 walks in 186 career
games with the Cardinals, who acquired him from Oakland on July 31,
1997.

Russian president sends greetings to cardiologist Michael DeBakey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin sent 90th birthday greetings Monday
to Dr. Michael DeBakey, the Houston cardiologist who has advised
him on his heart problems for years.
	   ``Hearty congratulations on your jubilee,'' the Russian
president wrote, according to his press service. ``I'm certain that
tens of thousands of people join me in my congratulations. It is
precisely thanks to you that they can once again feel the joy of
life and find hope.''
	   Yeltsin, now 67, underwent a quintuple bypass operation two
years ago. DeBakey, a world famous cardiologist, consulted with
Yeltsin's doctors before and after the surgery.
	   ``Fate brought us together two years ago at a difficult time for
me and my family. I saw in you a kind and strong person, talented,
with hands one can trust,'' Yeltsin wrote.
	   ``Life is harsh to the human heart. He who eases our pain can
call himself truly happy. There is no calling more blessed and
humane.''
	   DeBakey, a professor and researcher at Baylor University in
Houston, Texas, was born Sept. 7, 1908. Yeltsin concluded his
message by wishing him ``strong health.''

Hundreds flock to Spanish toad as no-cost Viagra substitute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to change slug &QR; 

<TEXT>
	   ALCALA DE LA SELVA, Spain (AP) _ With torches lighting their way
in the dark of night, hundreds of people climbed a hillside to pay
homage to a giant toad that is this town's answer to Viagra.
	   The toad is a rock formation, five meters high by five meters
wide (17 feet by 17 feet), overlooking this mountain hamlet of 500
souls in eastern Spain's Teruel province.
	   Legend has it that if you touch the creature three times _no
need to kiss it _ under a full moon, great things will happen in
every room of the house.
	   As a full moon rose over Alcala de la Selva on Sunday night,
pilgrims came from all over, marching up in the hill in a
single-file procession. Mayor Benito Ros estimated the turnout at
up to 1,000.
	   ``We had tons of people,'' Ros said. ``Fortunately, the rock is
large, so many people can touch it at the same time.''
	   The toad is supposed to be all-powerful, helping people win the
lottery, say, or pass a civil service exam, or, of course, put zing
back into their love life.
	   Ros says the story's been around for a long time _ nobody really
knows how long _ and was nearly forgotten, except by old-timers.
But now the toad's been dusted off and re-embraced as a
tongue-in-cheek rival to the sexual potency drug Viagra.
	   Does anybody really believe in the toad? ``Some do, some
don't,'' he says. ``A lot take it as a joke.''
	   Still, although it may be psychosomatic, some people actually
report experiencing fresh sexual zip after touching the toad _ with
none of Viagra's side effects, the mayor says.
	   Ros, 47, admitted that he, too, touched the toad, but just for
good luck. ``I have four children. I don't need any more
fertility.''

With Sosa watching, McGwire hits No. 61
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with No. 61. &QL; 
 &UR; By TED ANTHONY &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire tied Roger Maris' 37-year-old
home-run record this afternoon, lining his 61st homer 430 feet (130
meters) into the left-field stands for a share of baseball history.
	   McGwire put the ball just feet from where he pulled one foul
Sunday. This time around, after hitting one of Mike Morgan's
pitches, he rounded the bases in triumph and, after touching home
plate, hoisted his batboy son Matt into the air jubilantly. In
right field, the Cubs' Sammy Sosa, nipping at McGwire's heels with
58 homers, clapped into his mitt.
	   Maris' 1961 record, which topped the 60 Babe Ruth hit in 1927,
stood for a generation, though McGwire came within two last season.
Now, baseball's leading home run hitters, McGwire and Sosa, are set
to spend the next day watching each other try to reach 62 first.
	   Busch Stadium was sold out, and anticipation grew with each
at-bat. The capacity crowd went wild with McGwire's shot, calling
him out for two curtain calls.
	   Before the game, sitting biceps to biceps beyond the right-field
wall, McGwire and Sosa hardly looked like rivals for one of
baseball's most cherished records. They laughed, joked and
high-fived throughout a news conference today.
	   ``Wouldn't it be great if we just ended up tied?'' McGwire said.
	   ``My situation is different,'' Sosa said. ``I'm trying to make
the playoffs.''
	   Sosa's Cubs are a game ahead of the New York Mets in the NL wild
card race, while the Cardinals are out of contention. But the
individual confrontation claims the spotlight for these two days.
	   ``If you can't be looking forward to these two games, then your
heart is not beating,'' McGwire said.
	   ``The situation is going to be out of control,'' said Sosa, who
has 58 homers.
	   The Cardinals beat the Reds 5-2 Sunday in a game that had little
statistical significance to either team, both of which are hovering
under .500. Not so the Cubs.
	   ``What they're going for is more meaningful, obviously,''
Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said of the Cubs. ``They're trying
to qualify for the playoffs. We're just trying to finish over
.500.''
	   One key question _ are opposing pitchers throwing around
McGwire? _ still hangs, though Sunday's at-bats seemed to indicate
McGwire was getting his shots in. He hit a sixth-inning liner to
left field off Reds starter Brett Tomko was just foul, and a liner
at the mound in the eighth that was close to reliever John Hudek's
head.
	   ``He was just one person I had to get out,'' said Hudek, ice
packs attached to both a shoulder and a knee. ``I just didn't do a
very good job of getting anyone else out.''
	   Tomko, who said last week he wouldn't mind surrendering No. 62,
concurred.
	   ``I think Mark knows that I went after him aggressively. It's
not even an issue,'' he said, though he allowed this much: ``Either
way, I was going to have a story. Now I can say I struck him out
with history on the line.''
	   McGwire struck out three pitches later, ending up 0-for-3 but
managing to score once after being walked amid a hearty cacophony
of boos.
	   Watching in the stands were Roger Maris' four sons and two
daughters, with Roger Maris Jr. holding the bat his father used to
hit No. 61 in 1961. The Maris boys, boys no longer, have their
father's intense gaze and carry his mantle; they lined up after the
game to praise McGwire and Sosa.
	   ``Dad always said every record was made to be broken,'' said
Randy Maris, 37, ``He knew this one was going to be broken, too.''

Mets sign Cuban star

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jorge Luis Toca, a former member of Cuba's
national team who played alongside several future major leaguers
before leaving his country, agreed Monday to a minor-league
contract with the New York Mets.
	   Toca, a 23-year-old first baseman/outfielder, fled Cuba by boat
on March 20 and landed in the Bahamas. He then went to Japan, where
his wife has citizenship, and came to the United States on a
tourist visa.
	   ``We feel very privileged to add a player of this caliber to our
organization,'' Mets general manager Steve Phillips said. ``We
think that Jorge is an excellent young power hitter.''
	   Toca, who last played in Cuba in April 1997, played with Florida
pitcher Livan Hernandez and New York Yankees pitcher Orlando ``El
Duque'' Hernandez. He was a boyhood teammate of Mets shortstop Rey
Ordonez.
	   Toca will join the Mets Instructional League team later this
week. Phillips said he hoped to find a winter baseball assignment
for him.
	   Toca, a right-handed power hitter who said he hit 35 homers in
1995, worked out with the Mets on their recent trip to Los Angeles.
He took batting practice with the Mets prior to Monday's game
against the Atlanta Braves.
	   ``I'm very happy to be here at Shea Stadium,'' Toca said. ``I
always liked this team.''
	   Toca began playing with Ordonez on a junior national team when
he was 12.
	   ``I can't tell you how happy I am to be reunited with Rey,'' he
said.
	   Toca is the sixth foreign player signed by the Mets since they
agreed to terms with Japanese pitcher Masato Yoshii last winter. In
August, the Mets singed 16-year-old shortstop Enrique Cruz of the
Dominican Republic.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Security forces used batons and
shields to push hundreds of students from the grounds of Parliament
early Tuesday after demonstrators tore down its gates in protest
against President B.J. Habibie.
	   The protest, which began Monday, was the biggest outside the
legislature since a marathon student sit-in there helped force
Habibie's autocratic predecessor, ex-President Suharto, to step
down four months ago.
	   Student leaders claimed that 10 demonstrators were injured in
the clash, which took place more than 12 hours after about 2,000
marched on the Parliament.
	   A police spokesman said five officers were injured.
	   Chanting anti-government slogans, the students gathered outside
the green-domed building to demand that Habibie quit because of his
handling of Indonesia's economic crisis.
	   They also urged that Suharto be put on trial for alleged
misdeeds, including corruption and repression, during his 32 years
as leader of this nation of 202 million people.
	   Officers corralled the protesters in a parking lot on the
grounds after they threw plastic water bottles at police.
	   Many protesters later left peacefully.
	   However, about 300 refused repeated requests to disperse. A
standoff dragged on until about 1.30 a.m. when officers evicted the
protesters, who this timowned shops as well as cars.
	   There have been riots around Indonesia over the last two weeks,
including unrest in the northern province of Aceh where two people
died.
	   In the days before Suharto quit in May, students occupied
Parliament with the military's permission, camping out and daubing
the walls with pro-democracy graffiti. Soldiers evicted them after
Suharto's resignation.
	   Habibie is implementing democratic reforms, and has scheduled
general elections next year. Although he is dismantling the legacy
of his autocratic predecessor, there is widespread discontent over
Indonesia's shattered economy.
	   Student demonstrators urged the government to lower the priced
of rice and other basic commodities, which have soared over the
past year. Unemployment is also high, and the economy is expected
to shrink by as much as 15 percent this year.
	   ``Habibie is no good because he can't lower the price of staple
foods,'' said protester Mito Parar. ``That's why we demand again
and again before the Parliament that Habibie step down.''
	   Student protests in recent weeks have lacked the intensity of
the near-daily rallies that helped oust Suharto.

Defense in tourist slaying trial wants to question survivor

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The lawyer for a former Israeli paratrooper who
confessed to fatally shooting a British tourist and wounding his
girlfriend asked Monday that the woman be brought to Israel to
testify.
	   Daniel Okev, 45, is charged in the slaying of Jeffrey Hunter,
22, and the wounding of Charlotte Gibb, then 22, in August 1997.
	   The two were hitchhiking in southern Israel when Okev picked
them up. He stopped at an isolated spot in the desert and shot them
both with a pistol.
	   Okev claimed his actions were the result of trauma caused by his
service in an Israeli special forces squad. The unit hunted down
and executed suspected Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip in
the early 1970s.
	   Okev's lawyer David Yiftach says Ofek is not competent to stand
trial, and argued he has ``diminished responsibility'' due to his
mental condition.
	   At a session Monday in Beersheba District Court, Yiftach asked
that Gibb be brought to Israel so he can question her in open
court. Presiding Judge Yehoshua Pilpel said this could be extremely
distressing for the woman, and gave Yiftach three days to consider
whether he really wanted Gibb called.
	   ``If I insist, the prosecution has no choice but to bring her,''
the lawyer told The Associated Press.
	   Meanwhile, a prosecution psychiatrist who testified Sunday that
Ofek was competent to stand trial admitted Monday under
cross-examination that Ofek's action could have been caused by an
incident he experienced during the 1973 Mideast war, the defense
said.
	   Ofek's gun once jammed as he tried to open fire on five Egyptian
commandos, and he survived only because his companions shot them as
he was trying desperately to fix the weapon.
	   Both the wartime incident and the shooting of the two tourists
occurred at night, in the desert.
	   The next court hearing is scheduled for October 25.

	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyana will borrow dlrs 5.1 million
from the Caribbean Development Bank to help improve small farms,
the government announced Monday.
	   The money, along with another dlrs 462,000 grant from the bank,
will pay for training and equipment for farmers raising rice,
livestock and new crops.
	   Guyana's small farmers were severely hurt by a drought earlier
this year caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon.

Israel expects growth in immigration due to Russian economic
</HEADLINE>
crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel expects a sharp increase in immigration
of Jews from Russia if the current economic crisis there continues,
and is making plans to absorb the immigrants, cabinet ministers
said Monday.
	   The ministerial committee on immigration and absorption adopted
a plan to provide housing for the immigrants and help them find
jobs and adjust to their new home.
	   Israel believes that if the economic continues the flow of
immigrants from Russia and the other former Soviet republics could
swell from about 50,000 a year to 80,000 or even 120,000,
Immigration and Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein said.
	   Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky, who recently
visited Russia, said ``I got the feeling that the self-confidence
of the Jews in Russia in their ability to make a living has been
shaken.''
	   Sharansky and Edelstein are themselves immigrants from the
former Soviet Union. Sharansky is chairman of the ministerial
committee.
	   The plan consists of locating cities, towns and villages in
Israel where housing is available and there are job opportunities.
	   Construction of public housing for immigrants is to be
increased. Places are to be made available at Hebrew language
schools for the immigrants.
	   Russian-speaking immigrants who have already settled in Israel
are to be enlisted to help the newcomers adjust. The
Russian-language media in Israel is to be used to provide
information on jobs and housing.
	   Israeli representatives of the Jewish Agency in Russia and the
surrounding republics are to encourage young, highly qualified Jews
to choose Israel as their new home.
	   Edelstein said ``I wish the Russian government success in
stabilizing its economy, but we have to be prepared to receive the
immigrants, on the basis of the lessons of the past.''
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised that the necessary
budgets would be available.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Military police fired hundreds of
rounds into the air to disperse protesters Monday, after strongman
Hun Sen launched a crackdown against his political opponents.
	   Hun Sen ordered anti-government protests in the capital to end
by midnight and called for the arrest of opposition leader Sam
Rainsy, blaming him for a grenade attack on his home Monday.
	   After three minutes of intense firing outside the luxury
Cambodiana hotel, protesters had cleared the area, but later
returned. Police charged the crowd repeatedly, scattering the
demonstraters, who returned again and again.
	   One man was killed and at least three were injured.
	   The military police also unleashed a barrage of tracer rounds
into the sky near a demonstration of thousands of people in front
of the National Assembly, wounding at least one person.
	   The government reversed the midnight deadline at the last minute
after a government official, Prum Sokha, met with opposition
representatives and U.N. officials in the Cambodiana hotel.
	   Sam Rainsy was taking refuge in the hotel, where the senior U.N.
representative in Cambodia, Lakhan Mehrotra, has his office.
	   Prum Sokha said there would be no arrests Monday night and no
further efforts to clear the protesters. He said efforts to end the
confrontations peacefully would continue Tuesday.
	   Opposition politicians accuse Hun Sen of rigging the July 26
national elections he won, and have staged demonstrations ever
since, including a round-the-clock protest outside the National
Assembly for the past two weeks.
	   Although Hun Sen's party won a majority in the elections, he is
short of the necessary number of seats to form a new government.
	   Both Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who leads a royalist party that
came second in the elections, and Sam Rainsy, whose party came in
third, have threatened to boycott the assembly, and have refused
offers to join a coalition, meaning Cambodia could have no legal
government when the assembly meets for the first time Sept. 24.
	   Hun Sen on Monday called Sam Rainsy ``a terrorist,'' and ordered
him arrested. He also said Ranariddh might be arrested. Prum Sokha
denied that any arrest warrant had been issued for Sam Rainsy.
	   Through a spokesman, Sam Rainsy said he was under the protection
of the United Nations. His claim of U.N. protection could not
immediately be confirmed, but his party said any arrest would
violate a U.N. agreement to allow opposition leaders who fled
Cambodia following last year's coup to return to freely contest the
elections.
	   Hun Sen deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister last year in a
bloody coup. The prince won U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993, but
Hun Sen muscled his way into a tense coalition by threatening civil
war.
	   Sam Rainsy's party said it knew nothing about the grenade attack
on Hun Sen's home, and said the government was using it as an
excuse to crush the opposition.
	   ``The regime is using every pretext it can find to justify the
illegal and anti-democratic actions it seems to be preparing to
take against the peaceful political opposition,'' it said in a
written statement.
	   Police said no one was hurt and Hun Sen was not home when two
grenades were thrown from one or two passing motorcycles over the
gates of his residence in the capital. The only damage appeared to
be a shattered window.
	   Hun Sen denied speculation he had staged the grenade attack to
crack down on opponents.

	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Rebel leaders and the Congolese
government they are trying to unseat reached a breakthrough in
peace talks Monday, said Zambian President Frederick Chiluba,
chairman of the peace summit.
	   Chiluba refused to give details and would not comment on whether
a cease-fire had been reached, but said there was an agreement.
	   ``All of us have agreed,'' he said. ``Details of the agreement
will be released tomorrow.''
	   Chiluba said the group of regional presidents will reconvene
Tuesday for further deliberations before issuing further
information.
	   ``We have had a very good meeting. Please take it things have
gone extremely well,'' he told reporters.
	   Congo President Laurent Kabila has refused to meet face-to-face
with the rebels who control a quarter of his vast mineral-rich
central African nation.
	   The rebels, excluded from two previous summits over the past
month, arrived Monday for talks with Kabila, and the presidents of
Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Uganda and Rwanda.
	   Kabila accuses Uganda and Rwanda of sending troops to back the
rebels _ a claim they deny _ while Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia
have sent military help to back Kabila's government.
	   ``We are ready to talk, and we hope the leaders will listen to
us,'' Arthur Zahidi Ngoma of the rebel Congolese Democratic
Coalition said at the airport. ``There will be no cease-fire before
political negotiations and no cease-fire before troops from
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia leave.''
	   In the rebels' eastern Congo stronghold of Goma, a spokesman
said Monday that planes supporting Kabila's government had bombed
the Lake Tanganyika port of Kalemie for the second straight day,
killing an unspecified number of civilians.
	   Kin-Kiey Mulumba did not say which of Kabila's allies _
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia _ deployed the fighter jets. Only two
_ Zimbabwe and Angola _ are known to have military aircraft.
	   Congolese military official Francois Olenga said Kabila's
delegation will resist attempts to persuade them to meet with the
rebels. ``They are not rebels. They are invaders,'' he said.
	   By late Monday, the rebels had still not met face-to-face with
Kabila's group.
	   The head of the rebel delegation, Bizima Karaha, a former
foreign minister in Kabila's government, and one of Karaha's
deputies, Arthur Zahaidi Ngoma, met only with summit chairman
Chiluba and Organization of African Unity Secretary General Salim
Ahmed Salim for over an hour.
	   Chiluba then briefed Kabila's group on their talks with the
rebels, said George Charamba, spokesman for Zimbabwe President
Robert Mugabe.
	   Before the presidents began talks, officials huddled in meetings
seeking a way to allow all the warring factions to discuss terms of
a cease-fire and withdrawal of all foreign troops.
	   They also discussed the establishment of an African peacekeeping
force, possibly under the Organization of African Unity.
	   ``This summit will bring a solution to the conflict,'' a
confident Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos said when he
arrived Monday morning.
	   Salim, of the OAU, said the aim of the talks was to reach a
cease-fire that would ensure the continuation of Kabila's
government but also bring about democratic reforms.
	   Kabila has been trying to suppress a rebel insurrection since
late July. When the rebels were marching on Kinshasa, the capital,
troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia intervened on behalf of
Kabila.
	   Kabila has said he will not agree to a cease-fire until all
Rwandan and Ugandan troops withdraw from Congo.

Rain halts play at U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout, ADDS rain delay &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A fast-moving severe thunderstorm halted play at
the U.S. Open Monday and sent spectators scattering.
	   Heavy rains lashed the area, skies turned midnight black and
tornadoes were spotted in the New York area.
	   Before the storm struck, lights at the National Tennis Center
had been turned on. The winds picked up, affecting play, especially
the ball toss on serves, before play was suspended.
	   When play stopped, top-seeded Pete Sampras, seeking his
record-tying 12th Grand Slam singles title, led Russia's Marat
Safin 6-4, 2-1 and fifth-seeded Venus Williams was ahead of No. 12
Mary Pierce 6-1, 1-0 in Stadium 2.
	   In the only singles match completed before the storm, Amanda
Coetzer slammed a backhand passing shot down the line on match
point to survive a marathon third-round battle and upset
seventh-seeded Conchita Martinez 6-4, 4-6, 6-2.
	   With both Coetzer, the No. 13 seed from South Africa, and
Martinez playing behind the baseline and occasionally engaging in
moonball rallies, the match took 2 hours, 39 minutes, to play. One
game had 28 points, including 11 deuces, and consumed 20 minutes,
25 seconds.
	   The victory put Coetzer into the quarterfinals, where she will
play the winner of a later match today between No. 2 Lindsay
Davenport and No. 10 Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Martinez, a Spaniard who won Wimbledon in 1994 and reached the
Australian Open in January, took a medical timeout and had her
right shoulder worked on after the first game of the second set. It
was then she and Coetzer battled through the longest game of this
year's competition.
	   Fourteen years ago, it was the Age of Martina _ Navratilova, not
Hingis _ and Chris Evert.
	   John McEnroe won his fourth U.S. Open men's singles title by
beating Ivan Lendl, and Jimmy Connors had reached the Wimbledon
final.
	   The year was 1984 and Steffi Graf, then 15 years old, made her
debut in the main draw at the National Tennis Center, losing in the
first round to fellow German Sylvia Hanika 6-4, 6-2.
	   Today, Evert and Connors are in the International Hall of Fame,
with McEnroe, Navratilova and Lendl sure to join them in the
Newport, Rhode Island, shrine in the next few years.
	   And Graf is out of the U.S. Open before the quarterfinals for
the first time since she lost to Hanika 14 years prior.
	   Her conqueror Sunday night was 19-year-old Patty Schnyder of
Switzerland, one of the bright rising stars in women's tennis.
	   After her loss, Graf, dressed in a blue T-shirt emblazoned with
the New York Yankee ``NY'' on her chest, left the National Tennis
Center with a promise.
	   ``I'll be back,'' she said.
	   There was an upset in the men's singles Sunday night as
second-seeded Marcelo Rios lost to Sweden's Magnus Larsson 6-1, 6-7
(3-7), 2-6, 6-3, 6-2.
	   Although seeded 11th in this year's field, three spots below
Graf, Schnyder probably should have been the favorite in their
fourth-round match. Graf is 26th in the Corel WTA Tour rankings
this week, while Schnyder is ranked 10th: Graf received a special
seeding after missing more than a year after undergoing knee
surgery.
	   In their match, it was Schnyder who operated with surgical
precision, showing off a bigger forehand that the woman once called
``Fraulein Forehand'' and repeatedly picking on the German's
weakness, her slice backhand.
	   ``She has a lot of potential. There's no question about it,''
Graf said of Schnyder. ``She's got so much talent. ... She uses the
court extremely well.''
	   Schnyder, who has won five tournaments this year, jumped out to
a 3-0 lead and took advantage of 14 unforced errors by Graf in the
first seven games. Graf, who began the match with tape around her
right wrist, removed the tape after falling behind 5-2.
	   In the second set, Schnyder took a 2-1 lead with another service
break. Graf immediately broke back, and the set was tied 4-4 until
Schnyder broke again in the ninth game. She then saved two break
points and served out the victory on her second match point.
	   ``She's the greatest player in the last 10 years. Sometimes it's
difficult because you think of that,'' Schnyder said. ``But you
just try to play against her like all other opponents.''
	   Graf has won 21 Grand Slam tournament singles titles and held
the No. 1 ranking for a record 374 weeks. She is less than dlrs
14,000 shy of taking over the career earnings title from
Navratilova, a figure she would have eclipsed if she had reached
the quarters.
	   Since that beginning in 1984, Graf reached the quarters in 1992
and the semifinals in '85, '86 and '91. With the exception of last
year, when she was recuperating, she has reached the final every
other year, winning in 1988, '89, '93, '95 and '96. The loss also
halted a 17-match winning streak at the year's final Grand Slam
tournament.
	   ``At times, it has been difficult to accept that it is going to
take a certain time,'' Graf said of her return to the game. ``There
have been good and bad moments _ I knew that they would come.''
	   The other top women's seeds won as the first week came to a
close.
	   Top-seeded Martina Hingis and No. 6 Monica Seles reached their
quarterfinal matchup, despite struggling. Wimbledon champion Jana
Novotna, the No. 3 seed, also won and will face Schnyder next.
	   Besides Rios, who supplanted Pete Sampras as the top-ranked
men's player twice this year, also failing to advance was
fifth-seeded Richard Krajicek. He retired in the second set against
Thomas Johansson of Sweden with tendinitis in his left knee.
	   French Open champion Carlos Moya, seeded 10th, outlasted
Jan-Michael Gambill 6-2, 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) in a three-hour
match in which both players tossed rackets in frustration.
	   Another American, Geoff Grant, also lost a five-set
heartbreaker, to Germany's Oliver Gross 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 5-7, 6-3,
7-5.
	   That left only two American men _ former champions Sampras and
Andre Agassi _ in the running for the crown.
	   Other winners Sunday included No. 7 Alex Corretja of Spain, No.
11 Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia, No. 13 Tim Henman of Britain and
Mark Philippoussis of Australia.

Israel expects growth in immigration due to Russian economic

crisis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel expects a sharp increase in immigration
of Jews from Russia if the current economic crisis there continues,
and is making plans to absorb the immigrants, cabinet ministers
said Monday.
	   The ministerial committee on immigration and absorption adopted
a plan to provide housing for the immigrants and help them find
jobs and adjust to their new home.
	   Israel believes that if the economic crisis continues, the flow
of immigrants from Russia and other former Soviet republics could
swell from about 50,000 a year to 80,000 or even 120,000,
Immigration and Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein said.
	   Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky, who recently
visited Russia, said ``I got the feeling that the self-confidence
of the Jews in Russia in their ability to make a living has been
shaken.''
	   Edelstein said ``I wish the Russian government success in
stabilizing its economy, but we have to be prepared to receive the
immigrants, on the basis of the lessons of the past.''
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised that the necessary
money would be available.

<TEXT>
	   PEGGY'S COVE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Local fishermen, the first to
encounter the hopeless wreckage of Swissair Flight 111, have been
hailed as heroes for venturing into the nighttime disaster zone.
	   Now, saddened and still in shock over Canada's worst air
disaster at sea, they find themselves barred from their own waters
and wondering when they can go back to work.
	   Authorities have prohibited all access to the ocean around the
crash site while searchers continue collecting bodies and wreckage.
It's a tough situation, some fishermen said Monday, because while
they want to show respect for the disaster's 229 victims, they also
need to make a living.
	   ``Our hearts go out to the victims and their families. Their
needs have to come before ours at the moment,'' said Terry Schnare,
a 42-year-old fisherman from Glen Margaret, one of many seaside
villages ringing the site of Wednesday's crash.
	   In the same breath, Schnare said he is eager to return to the
North Atlantic to set his nets for bluefin tuna _ a catch that can
bring hundreds of dollars per fish on the Japanese market.
	   The orange buoys to which he attaches his net sit only a short
distance offshore, in view of the Peggy's Cove lighthouse where
grieving relatives tossed flowers into the sea.
	   Schnare and his crew had finished repairing their nets Wednesday
and were prepared to go to sea the when the plane fell from the
sky.
	   It's unclear when Schnare and more than 1,000 men and women who
fish the waters now littered with wreckage will be allowed to
return for good. Talks were under way Monday in Halifax with
government authorities.
	   In towns along the coast, many people were sympathetic to the
fishermen, some of whom are struggling to pay their bills during
what is normally their busy season.
	   ``They're getting a slap on the face _ a big one,'' said
Lawrence Morash, who operates a deep-sea fishing charter out of his
West Dover home.
	   During the downtime, some fishermen have chartered their boats
to reporters and photographers eager to get a glimpse of the
wreckage. Often they have been shooed away by police. One was
ordered to back off when the periscope of a large navy submarine
aiding the search surfaced nearby, startling all aboard.
	   Some fishermen, under close supervision of crash investigators,
may be allowed to pull in nets that were set out before Flight 111
crashed, said Tim Surette, a regional official with Canada's
Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Others could be permitted to
feed tuna that remain in their nets to be fattened for market.
	   Any wreckage or human remains found in nets would be retrieved
and cataloged.
	   Some who make their living on the sea do not want to go back
yet.
	   Jim Buckley, one of the first to captain a boat into the
jetliner's shattered remains, said he will have a tough time
guiding tours aboard his whale-watching boat ``So Much to Sea.''
	   On Monday, while television crews packed up outside his Peggy's
Cove home, Buckley looked over the ocean, holding back tears and
petting his Siamese cat.
	   ``Everything you look for _ whales and dolphins _ you all look
into the water. It will always be in the back of my mind,'' he
said. ``Everybody is going to want to go out to the crash site and
ask me what happened. I'm just fed up with it. I want to let those
people rest in peace.''

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire took his place alongside Roger
Maris Monday, tying one of North American baseball's most hallowed
records with home run No. 61.
	   The landmark drive came in the first inning against the Chicago
Cubs, on just the third pitch thrown to McGwire by Mike Morgan.
	   Meantime, Chicago's very own home run hero, Sammy Sosa _ just
behind McGwire with 58 _ smiled and clapped in appreciation.
	   ``Wouldn't it be great if we just ended up tied,'' McGwire said
before the game, sitting next to Sosa at a news conference. ``I
think it would be beautiful.''
	   McGwire's 430-foot (130 meters) homer came in the 144th game for
the St. Louis Cardinals, eliminating any need for an asterisk _
Maris' fate when he broke Ruth's record in 1961.
	   The crowd cheered wildly as McGwire held both arms wide and high
as he approached first base and got a high five from the Cubs' Mark
Grace.
	   McGwire's 10-year-old son, Matthew, was waiting at home plate
for his Dad, who lifted him up in his arms for a big celebration
hug.
	   McGwire nodded his appreciation to the standing, roaring crowd,
and then sent a special signal to members of the Maris family
seated on the first-base side: He pointed his right index finger to
the sky, tapped his heart three times and blew them a kiss.
	   ``He tapped his heart, like dad was in his heart,'' said Kevin
Maris, a son of the Yankees slugger.
	   McGwire's drive slammed off the facade of the stadium club _ the
third deck at Busch Stadium _ and fell into the packed stands
below. Mike Davidson, a 28-year-old from St. Louis, wound up with
it after it deflected off the hands of three other people.
	   Davidson said he was sitting in his brother-in-law's seats: ``He
gave them to me because he had to work today.''
	   The lucky fan said he planned to give the ball to McGwire and
wouldn't ask for anything in return.
	   McGwire had 20 games remaining to set his own record, so the
main suspense is whether he could hold off Sosa _ who fouled out to
McGwire in his first at-bat and was called out on strikes when he
came up in the third.
	   Only three players have hit 60 or more homers in a season. Babe
Ruth had 60 in 1927, a record that stood until Maris hit 61 in
1961.
	   Maris hit his 61st homer on the last day of a season scheduled
for 162 games, drawing an asterisk in the record book that stood
until it was removed in the early 1990s _ after Maris' death.
	   Ruth accomplished his feat in the Yankees' next-to-last game of
a season scheduled for 154 games.
	   McGwire's first chance to break Maris' record came in the third
inning, when he singled sharply past former teammate Gary Gaetti at
third. After the 61st homer, Gaetti high-fived McGwire as he was
making the final turn toward home.
	   On the last step of his trot, McGwire hopped on the plate with
both feet for emphasis.
	   The first fan to get his hand on the ball was Rich Reichert, 32,
of St. Louis. But he couldn't hang on and cut his left ring finger
as he tumbled to the concrete.
	   ``After the ball bounced off my hands, it was a little bit of a
blur,'' Reichert said. ``All I know was I got knocked down by about
10 guys.''
	   When Sosa came to the plate in the top half of the first, the
crowd _ clad mostly in Cardinal red _ saluted the Cubs' slugger
with a standing ovation, quite a tribute considering the
longstanding rivalry between the teams.
	   Sosa tipped his hat to the crowd and gave his trademark
two-finger salute to McGwire, holding a runner at first.
	   The crowd wasn't as loud when McGwire, batting third in the
Cardinals order, stepped up in the bottom of the inning with two
outs. Out in right field, Sosa clapped his right hand against his
glove.
	   Three pitches later, the scene turned into bedlam. After missing
the first pitch and taking a ball, McGwire sent the ball hurtling
toward the left-field stands. A day earlier, a McGwire drive had
taken a similar path but hooked foul by about 7 feet (2 meters).
	   This time, there was no doubt.
	   McGwire entered the game 1-for-6 in his career against Morgan, a
38-year-old right-hander acquired by the Cubs from Minnesota on
Aug. 25. Big Mac has now hit five homers against Chicago this
season.
	   Before today, Sosa and McGwire had homered twice in the same
game. Twenty times in this remarkable season, they've homered on
the same day.
	   St. Louis has 11 games left this year at Busch Stadium, where
McGwire has 31 homers, shattering the previous season record of 17.
	   McGwire, who popped to center in the fifth, has 85 homers, 170
RBIs and 190 walks in 186 career games with the Cardinals, who
acquired him from Oakland on July 31, 1997.

	   PALE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A hard-line Serb official was
banned Monday from campaigning in Bosnia's upcoming elections,
while more posters of nationalist leader Radovan Karadzic appeared
in violation of election rules.
	   International officials overseeing the weekend election to
choose leaders of Bosnia's various top government levels have
banned more than 25 candidates in an attempt to set up free and
fair voting.
	   The main Bosnian Croat party, the Bosnian Croat Democratic
Union, or HDZ, reacted bitterly and threatened to boycott the
election this Saturday and Sunday.
	   Over the weekend, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman supported
his protegees in Bosnia, saying the banning of candidates could
jeopardize the peace process. Tudjman backed Croat hard-liners in
Bosnia throughout the war that ended in 1995 with the Dayton
accord.
	   Voters will choose leaders for Bosnia's two territories _ one
Serb and one a federation of Muslims and Croats. The three ethnic
groups fought the war for control of Bosnia-Herzegovina and now are
holding the third election under the Dayton accord.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
added Vojislav Seselj, leader of the Yugoslav Radicals, to the list
of banned candidates for inflammatory statements made about the
Bosnian political situation, OSCE officials said Monday.

Thousands march across Brazil to protest poverty, neglect

<TEXT>
	   APARECIDA DO NORTE, Brazil (AP) _ While many Brazilians
celebrated Independence Day on Monday, tens of thousands of
protesters rallied across the country to demand freedom from
poverty and neglect.
	   In dozens of cities, the fourth annual ``Cry of the Excluded''
drew the landless and the jobless, peasants and squatters,
politicians, clergy _ and even the occasional cellular-toting
businessman.
	   Many had set out as early as Aug. 3 from remote interior towns
to reach state capitals by Monday.
	   Some 50,000 people gathered for a mass and rally at the massive
basilica of Our Revealed Lady, Brazil's patron saint, in this town
107 miles (173 kms) east of Sao Paulo.
	   Bishop Demetrio Valentini accused the government of President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso of not caring about the poor.
	   ``The only value of government policies is consumerism,'' he
said. ``The only people who are respected are those with money,
leaving millions excluded outside the mainstream.''
	   Cardoso, who is running for re-election in October, has tamed
chronic high inflation and reduced the state's role in the economy.
But one result has been higher unemployment _ nearly 20 percent of
the work force in Sao Paulo, according to labor union statistics.
	   The peaceful protest was organized by the Roman Catholic Church,
labor unions and leftist political parties. Many candidates handed
out campaign leaflets at the rallies.
	   ``If we can join our voices in one large shout, those who rule
the country will hear us and try to stop the suffering,'' said
Luciane Pereira dos Santos, a 60-year-old housewife.
	   In Rio de Janeiro, nearly 2,000 demonstrators marched down Rio
Branco Avenue through the heart of the financial district. The same
number turned out for a march in Brasilia, the capital.
	   In the northeastern coastal city of Recife, the protest drew
12,000 members of the Landless Rural Workers Movement, a group that
often occupies unused land to pressure the government into speeding
up agrarian reform.
	   Cardoso was not oblivious to the protests. In Brasilia, he
signed decrees defending ``the rights of the unprotected.''
	   One bill gives amnesty to some 100,000 illegal immigrants. A
second creates 1.9 million acres (765,375 hectares) of Indian
reservations in five states, and a third grants land titles to the
descendants of runaway slaves who settled in the eastern Amazon.
	   The bills now go to Congress for approval.

Spanish government minister weighs in on soccer team's woes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with federation backing Clemente &QR; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The education and culture minister waded
into a debate Monday on the Spanish national soccer team's latest
dismal showing and what to do about coach Javier Clemente.
	   The minister, Esperanza Aguirre, said she shared ``the immense
disappointment of all Spaniards'' over a humiliating 3-2 loss
Saturday to lowly Cyprus in a qualifying round for the European
Championship in 2000.
	   ``I am convinced that the entire leadership of Spanish Football
Federation is reflecting very seriously,'' she told reporters. ``It
must take measures.''
	   Aguirre declined to say if she thought Clemente should be fired.
But she appeared to go out of her way to avoid mentioning his name,
and judging from her tone it sounded like she does want to see him
sacked.
	   Federation executives met Monday and endorsed Clemente, its
secretary general Gerardo Gonzalez Otero told the state news agency
Efe.
	   ``We understand the fans' mood, and we continue asking them to
trust us because we know the team will survive this temporary
setback,'' he said. ``In Cyprus we lost a battle, not the war.''
	   An education and culture ministry spokesman insisted Aguirre was
not out of line by talking about sports.
	   Although the soccer federation is independent, the education and
culture ministry does have responsibility for sports issues. And
Aguirre gave her opinion only because reporters asked her,
spokesman Manuel Soriano said.
	   ``She does not want to get involved in polemics,'' he insisted.
However, ``the government cannot ignore an issue that dominates
public opinion.''
	   Soriano added: ``She is not going to say what kind of coach the
team should have.''
	   Clemente declined to comment directly on what Aguirre said, but
he did sound miffed.
	   ``I will make no evaluation. I have nothing to say because I
like the minister. The day that politicians talk about sports, we
in football will talk about politics.''
	   Clemente has been in hot water since Spain, one of the
higher-rated teams in the World Cup in France, failed to make it
past the first round of soccer's premier tournament.
	   Then on Saturday the team suffered a howling embarrassment by
falling to a Cyprus team that has only four professional players.
The rest work as electricians, or in banks, or for the Cypriot
national telephone company. The coach makes his living as a police
inspector.
	   Spanish newspapers screamed for Clemente's head over the
weekend.

Talks set to resume
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Talks between Air Canada and its striking pilots
are set to resume Tuesday in Montreal.
	   Jean-Marc Belanger, chairman of the Air Canada Pilots
Association, said both sides had agreed Monday afternoon to return
to the table.
	   ``We are resuming negotiations with Air Canada ... at four
o'clock (Tuesday) afternoon,'' Belanger said.
	   A news release from Air Canada said the airline is hopeful an
agreement on outstanding issues can be reached.
	   ``We apparently reached the basis for a meaningful discussion,''
Air Canada spokesman John Hamilton said.
	   Although talks have resumed between the airline and its pilots,
flights remain canceled.
	   Hamilton said flights won't begin again until after an agreement
is ratified by the pilots' union.
	   Once a deal is approved by union members, the airline will be
able to start domestic flights in about 24 hours and international
flights shortly after that, Hamilton said.
	   The return to the negotiating table comes after what would have
been one of the busiest weekends of the year for the airline.

Third straight record low for Mexico's peso; stocks higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's peso closed down on Monday, setting
a third consecutive record low. But stocks closed higher, buoyed by
positive performances in other emerging markets.
	   The peso closed at a midrate of 10.26 to the dollar, down from
its Friday close of 10.22. Traders said the low volume of trade due
to the Labor Day holiday in the United States exaggerated the
peso's movements.
	   The peso has lost 21 percent of its value against the dollar
this year.
	   The peso lost ground despite a positive performance Monday by
other emerging markets, which boosted the Mexican stock exchange's
key IPC index by 4.9 percent.
	   The IPC index closed up 149.37 points at 3194.54. At the end of
1997, the IPC stood at 5229.35.
	   Volume was light, with 36.4 million shares traded worth 493.6
million pesos compared to Friday's volume of 77.5 million shares
worth 795.5 million pesos.
	   U.S. financial markets were closed for Labor Day, while Brazil's
markets were closed for a national holiday. Both generally have
significant impact on Mexican stock movements.

Hundreds flock to lucky Spanish toad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALCALA DE LA SELVA, Spain (AP) _ Upset about your job? Short of
money? Love life listless? This small Spanish town of 500 claims it
has the answer _ a rock formation that looks like a toad.
	   Legend has it that anyone who touches the five meter by five
meter (17 foot by 17 foot) formation three times under a full moon
will change their luck.
	   As a full moon rose over Alcala de la Selva on Sunday night,
about 1,000 pilgrims marched up the hill to touch the toad, said
Mayor Benito Ros.
	   ``We had tons of people,'' Ros said. ``Fortunately, the rock is
large, so many people can touch it at the same time.''
	   Ros said the story has been around for a long time and was
nearly forgotten. But now the toad legend has been dusted off and
re-embraced as a tongue-in-cheek rival to the sexual potency drug
Viagra.
	   Does anybody really believe in the toad?
	   ``Some do, some don't,'' said Ros. ``A lot take it as a joke.''
	   Still, some people actually report experiencing fresh sexual
vigor after touching the toad, the mayor said.
	   Ros, 47, admitted that he, too, touched the toad, but just for
good luck. ``I have four children,'' he said. ``I don't need any
more fertility.''

Firings fail to end doctors' strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The firing of almost the entire staff
of a public hospital failed Monday to end a week-old doctors'
strike that has crippled public health care in Caracas.
	   The doctors union said it may spread the strike throughout the
country unless the government raises their wages. About 1,600 of
the 2,000 public sector doctors in Caracas have walked off the job.
	   Authorities fired 250 doctors at Lidice public hospital on
Sunday after warning striking doctors last week they faced fines or
dismissals.
	   Most hospitals have shut down intensive care units and cancelled
pre-natal examinations and other routine treatment. Nurses and
paramedics have been scrambling to help keep emergency rooms open.
	   Doctors want their wages raised from 220,000 bolivars (dlrs 380)
a month to 600,000 bolivars (dlrs 1,030) a month. The cash-strapped
government says doctors received substantial raises last year.

No data on Swissair flight recorder for crucial last six minutes

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The flight-data recorder recovered
by divers near the wreckage of Swissair Flight 111 contains no
information for the six crucial minutes before the plane crashed,
investigators said Monday.
	   The setback offset good news from the search operation: a
Canadian navy submarine detected a signal the plane's other ``black
box'' _ the cockpit-voice recorder.
	   The chief crash investigator, Vic Gerden, said the flight-data
recorder retrieved Sunday was in good condition and should provide
more than 100 types of information ranging from altitude and
airspeed to whether the plane's smoke warning lights were on.
	   But he said there was no data from the last six minutes before
the MD-11 jumbo jet plunged into the ocean off the Nova Scotia
coast Wednesday night, killing all 229 people aboard.
	   Gerden said the data recording stopped once the plane dipped
below 10,000 feet. A strong possibility, he said, was that the
plane lost electrical power at this stage.
	   At the crash site, five miles offshore, divers equipped with
hand-held sonar searched 190 feet underwater for the cockpit-voice
recorder.
	   If retrieved intact, the voice recorder would reveal other
noises in the cockpit besides the pilots' conversation with
controllers, portions of which were released Saturday. That
conversation was cut off 10 minutes after the pilots reported smoke
in the cockpit and six minutes before the crash.
	   Divers also were trying to confirm if three large pieces of
wreckage found near the flight data recorder are sections of the
plane's fuselage.
	   Although officials have declined to give an updated figure of
how many bodies have been recovered, they have indicated that most
remain in the sea. Recovery of the fuselage also could lead to
recovery of many more bodies, officials said.
	   The Geneva-bound Swissair plane crashed 16 minutes after the
pilots reported the smoke and decided to attempt an emergency
landing more than an hour after leaving New York's Kennedy
International Airport.
	   After reporting an emergency, the plane started toward the
Halifax airport, but made two sharp turns as it tried to descend
and dump fuel.
	   Swissair officials say the plane couldn't have made a direct
approach to Halifax because it was flying too high and was too
heavy with 30 tons (27 metric tons) of fuel. The call was made 70
miles (115 kilometers) out of Halifax, but the pilots would have
needed 130 miles (210 kilometers) to make a direct landing,
Swissair said.
	   Alan Wolk, a U.S. pilot and aviation lawyer, said Sunday that
Flight 111's pilot, Urs Zimmermann, should have begun a direct
emergency descent sooner.
	   ``The MD-11 could have been landed overweight without
difficulty,'' Wolk said. ``We have learned from aircraft fires
historically that the only procedure that has a prayer of avoiding
an accident is the quickest possible descent and landing.''
	   Two relatives of one victim echoed Wolk's opinion Monday as they
visited Peggy's Cove, the tiny fishing village closest to the crash
scene.
	   Cheryl Klein and her brother, Abe, whose father was killed, said
they blamed the pilot for the crash.
	   ``I think he wasted valuable time when he made that big circle
to dump (fuel),'' said Cheryl. ``I think he should have just tried
to land.''
	   Several hundred family members have come to the area to visit
Peggy's Cove, attend memorial services and assist medical teams in
trying to identify badly fragmented human remains retrieved by
searchers.
	   More than 1,400 military personnel are involved in the search,
and more than 200 stress counselors have been assigned to support
them during their often grisly work.
	   ``Some of the stuff they're being exposed to is truly
horrible,'' said Mary Anne Murphy, a Coast Guard spokeswoman.
	   At the Shearwater military air base near Halifax, relatives have
been invited to look at personal effects found by the search team.
	   Claire Mortimer, 45, of Berkeley, California, said she went
there hoping to find her stepmother's ring, and instead found the
wallet of her father, former New York Times executive John
Mortimer.
	   ``It was a very wrenching experience,'' she said.
	   A memorial service was held late Monday for families and
colleagues of Flight 111's crew at the Roman Catholic church in
Kloten, next to Zurich airport.
	   Another memorial service was planned for Tuesday in Nairobi,
Kenya, to honor Pierce Gerety, 56, an American who directed relief
operations in central Africa for the U.N. High Commissioner of
Refugees.

Wage deal ends Israel's public sector strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with teachers' strike nearing end, last two grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A five-day strike of Israel's 300,000 public
sector employees ended Monday after the Histadrut Trade Union
Federation and the Treasury agreed on a 1.5 percent wage increase.
	   The deal averted a shutdown of Ben-Gurion International Airport
at the last minute. The Histadrut had threatened to widen its
strike and close the airport at 9 a.m. (0700 gmt) Monday.
	   The strike has disrupted life in Israel for the past five days.
In Tel Aviv, garbage piled up in the streets Sunday as municipal
sanitation workers joined the stoppage. All government offices,
post offices, railroads and seaports were closed.
	   Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman has said the wage increases
demanded by the unions would cause runaway inflation. Histadrut
leader Amid Peretz accused Neeman of scaring the public with
figures many times greater than the real cost of the increases.
	   Striking school teachers also reached agreement in principle
with the finance ministry Monday evening and expressed cautious
optimism that the schools would open Tuesday morning.
	   Union leaders and treasury officials worked into the night on
the details of the agreement. ``If there are no last-minute
problems it will be back to school tomorrow morning,'' said union
leader Ran Erez. The strike delayed the opening of the school year
for a week.

Tick, tick, tick ... Coetzer ins the longest match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ One game lasted more than 20 minutes. One set
lasted 76 minutes. The whole match outlasted two others on another
court.
	   ``I thought it was a long match,'' Conchita Martinez said after
13th-seeded Amanda Coetzer beat her 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 to advance to the
quarterfinals of the U.S. Open Monday.
	   The match lasted 2 hours, 39 minutes. It seemed longer, with
both players content to stand beyond the baseline and send looping
shots back and forth for long _ very long _ points.
	   The second game of the second set took 20 minutes, 25 seconds,
longer than an entire set of many other matches.
	   It included 28 points, had 11 deuces and long rallies. It only
served to even the set at 1-1.
	   The 1-hour, 16-minute second set was 10 minutes longer than it
took Patrick Rafter to beat David Nainkin on the men's side in
three sets.
	   Martinez, seeded seventh, had a neck injury that required
on-court treatment in the first set, adding more time. It also kept
her from playing an aggressive game.
	   ``If you would have seen me yesterday, you would have said
`There's no way she's going to go on court,' '' Martinez said. ``I
got two injections. I got a lot of treatment.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WEATHER WATCH: The heavy thunderstorm that stopped play for 2
hours, 20 minutes arrived quickly and sent people scurrying.
	   The skies darkened, causing the lights to be turned on in the
middle of the afternoon.
	   The wind came first, sending anything not fastened down flying
around the court, causing delays as ballboys tried to chase things
down.
	   Then the thunder and lightening came and the stadium cleared in
a few minutes as the people found shelter.
	   At least there were no tarps to cover the hard courts, as they
have at Wimbledon to protect the grass or the French Open to cover
the clay.
	   A few hundred yards away at Shea Stadium, they were having
problems keeping things covered. The violent storm with strong
winds forced New York Mets manager Bobby Valentine and his coaches
and ballboys to kneel or lay on the tarp over the infield when an
air bubble under tarp picked up the covering.
	   There was no apparent around the tennis grounds, although the
temperature dropped 22 degrees after the storm, from 89 to 67.
	   Once the rains stopped, the courts was dried by hand, with more
than 25 court attendants with towels wiping down the main court in
Arthur Ashe Stadium.
	   Meanwhile, inside the player's lounge, the TVs were turned to
another sport _ the Mark McGwire home-run watch.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DOUBLES LOSERS: For the second year in a row at the U.S. Open,
the top doubles team of Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge made an
early exit.
	   The Woodies lost in the third round to Cyril Suk and Sandon
Stolle, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5.
	   Last year, the Australians went out in the first round, ending a
streak of five consecutive Grand Slam tournament finals. In all
they have won nine Grand Slam doubles titles together, including
five straight Wimbledons.
	   It will be the first time since 1991 they have not won at least
one Grand Slam doubles titles, losing in the Australian Open and
Wimbledon finals and the round of 16 at the French this year.
	   ``We have high expectations, high standards,'' said Woodforde.
``We have to keep them up, otherwise you start sort of shuffling
down in the pack.''

Spanish government minister weighs in on soccer team's woes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The education and culture minister waded
into a debate Monday on the Spanish national soccer team's latest
dismal showing and what to do about coach Javier Clemente.
	   The minister, Esperanza Aguirre, said she shared ``the immense
disappointment of all Spaniards'' over a humiliating 3-2 loss
Saturday to lowly Cyprus in a qualifying round for the European
Championship in 2000.
	   ``I am convinced that the entire leadership of Spanish Football
Federation is reflecting very seriously,'' she told reporters. ``It
must take measures.''
	   Aguirre declined to say if she thought Clemente should be fired.
But she appeared to go out of her way to avoid mentioning his name,
and judging from her tone it sounded like she does want to see him
sacked.
	   Federation executives met Monday and endorsed Clemente, its
secretary general Gerardo Gonzalez Otero told the state news agency
Efe.
	   ``We understand the fans' mood, and we continue asking them to
trust us because we know the team will survive this temporary
setback,'' he said. ``In Cyprus we lost a battle, not the war.''
	   An education and culture ministry spokesman insisted Aguirre was
not out of line by talking about sports.
	   Although the soccer federation is independent, the education and
culture ministry does have responsibility for sports issues. And
Aguirre gave her opinion only because reporters asked her,
spokesman Manuel Soriano said.
	   ``She does not want to get involved in polemics,'' he insisted.
However, ``the government cannot ignore an issue that dominates
public opinion.''
	   Soriano added: ``She is not going to say what kind of coach the
team should have.''
	   Clemente declined to comment directly on what Aguirre said, but
he did sound miffed.
	   ``I will make no evaluation. I have nothing to say because I
like the minister. The day that politicians talk about sports, we
in football will talk about politics.''
	   Clemente has been in hot water since Spain, one of the
higher-rated teams in the World Cup in France, failed to make it
past the first round of soccer's premier tournament.
	   Then on Saturday the team suffered a howling embarrassment by
falling to a Cyprus team that has only four professional players.
The rest work as electricians, or in banks, or for the Cypriot
national telephone company. The coach makes his living as a police
inspector.
	   Spanish newspapers screamed for Clemente's head over the
weekend.

Sampras, rain dominate on Labor Day at U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sampras victory; will be UPDATED with
Williams-Pierce match &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The power lunch between Pete Sampras and Marat
Safin turned into a late-afternoon snack for the world's top
player.
	   On a day when thunderstorms turned the U.S. Open into Wimbledon
West for 2 1/4 hours, Sampras had 18 aces and never lost his serve
in a 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 victory Monday to move into the quarterfinals of
the tournament he has won four times.
	   The top-seeded Sampras next will face the winner of a match
between No. 8 Andre Agassi and No. 9 Karol Kucera.
	   Sampras lost only 20 points on his serve in the match and closed
out his 600th career win with three consecutive aces _ including
one at 135 mph (217 kph). He won 41 of 48 points on his first serve
in the match.
	   Safin, 18, who wowed crowds at this year's French Open with a
string of upsets en route to the fourth round in his Grand Slam
debut, showed off plenty of power, including 10 aces. But he was no
match for the steady Sampras.
	   Labor Day traditionally is the biggest showcase for the U.S.
Open, an afternoon when tennis captures the attention of American
sports fans.
	   Not this year.
	   Already overshadowed by Mark McGwire's chase for the home-run
record, the tournament nearly got washed away Monday as
thunderstorms and strong winds gave the courts all the charm of a
car wash.
	   With tornadoes touching down nearby, players were forced off the
courts as the sky turned pitch black in mid-afternoon. By the time
they returned, the temperature had dropped 22 degrees _ from 89 to
67.
	   The bad weather came just after the day's biggest sports moment,
McGwire's 61st homer in St. Louis. The feat was not announced to
the tennis crowd, although a big roar could be heard from Shea
Stadium across the subway tracks, where the Mets were playing
Atlanta.
	   The only singles match completed before the rain was a marathon
fourth-round women's contest in which No. 13 Amanda Coetzer slammed
a backhand passing shot down the line on match point to win 6-4,
4-6, 6-2 over No. 7 Conchita Martinez.
	   With Coetzer and Martinez engaging in long baseline rallies and
occasionally hitting moonballs, the match lasted 2 hours, 39
minutes. One game had 28 points, including 11 deuces, and consumed
more than 20 minutes. The second set alone, at 1:16, was only one
minute shorter than the entire Sampras-Safin match.
	   The victory put Coetzer into the quarterfinals against the
winner of the match between No. 2 Lindsay Davenport and No. 10
Nathalie Tauziat.
	   After an opening few days in which the favorites eased through
the tournament, there were a couple of big upsets Sunday night.
Five-time champion Steffi Graf was ousted by Patty Schnyder and the
second-seeded man, Marcelo Rios, lost a five-setter to Magnus
Larsson.
	   The defeat left Graf less than dlrs 14,000 short of overtaking
Martina Navratilova as the women's career earnings leader.
Navratilova won dlrs 20,337,902 in her career, a figure Graf would
have surpassed if she had won the match against Schnyder.

	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The flight-data recorder recovered
by divers near the wreckage of Swissair Flight 111 contains no
information for the final crucial minutes before the plane crashed,
investigators said Monday.
	   The setback offset good news from the search operation: a
Canadian navy submarine detected a signal from the plane's other
``black box'' _ the cockpit-voice recorder.
	   The chief crash investigator, Vic Gerden, said the flight-data
recorder retrieved Sunday was in good condition and should provide
more than 100 types of information ranging from altitude and
airspeed to whether the plane's smoke warning lights were on.
	   But he said there was no data for at least the last six minutes
before the MD-11 jumbo jet plunged into the ocean off the Nova
Scotia coast Wednesday night, killing all 229 people aboard.
	   Gerden said the data recording stopped once the plane dipped
below 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). He said it was a strong
possibility that the plane lost electrical power at that stage.
	   Navy officers revealed dramatic new details about Sunday's
retrieval of the data recorder. Capt. Phil Webster said one of the
two divers developed a leak in his suit, and the pair had to make
an ascent _ clutching the black box _ much more rapidly than
normal.
	   One of the divers became ill from the rapid change in pressure.
Both were put in a decompression chamber as a precaution, then
taken to a hospital. They are now recovering well at home, but
cannot dive for two weeks, Webster said.
	   At the crash site, five miles (8 kilometers) offshore from the
fishing village of Peggy's Cove, other divers equipped with
hand-held sonar searched 190 feet (60 meters) underwater Monday for
the cockpit-voice recorder.
	   Though signals were detected by the submarine, the divers could
not find the voice recorder before bad weather set in at day's end.
Diving operations were suspended for at least 36 hours.
	   If retrieved intact, the voice recorder would reveal other
noises in the cockpit besides the pilots' conversation with
controllers, portions of which were released Saturday. That
conversation was cut off 10 minutes after the pilots reported smoke
in the cockpit and six minutes before the crash.
	   Divers also were trying to pinpoint the location of three large
pieces of wreckage found near the flight data recorder and believed
to be sections of the plane's fuselage.
	   Although officials have declined to give an updated figure of
how many bodies have been recovered, they have indicated that most
remain in the sea. Recovery of the fuselage also could lead to
recovery of many more bodies, officials said.
	   Meanwhile, the plane's manufacturer acknowledged that much of
the electrical wiring aboard the plane was insulated with aromatic
polyimide tape, known by the trade name Kapton, which has been
banned from use in U.S. Navy planes.
	   Boeing Co. spokeswoman Susan Bradley said all the
general-purpose wiring aboard the plane was insulated with Kapton.
	   The U.S. Navy banned Kapton from its aircraft because of poor
performance, Air Safety Week, an industry newsletter, reported
Monday.
	   The Geneva-bound Swissair plane crashed 16 minutes after the
pilots reported the smoke and decided to attempt an emergency
landing more than an hour after leaving New York's Kennedy
International Airport.
	   After reporting an emergency, the plane started toward the
Halifax airport, but made two sharp turns as it tried to descend
and dump fuel.
	   Swissair officials say the plane couldn't have made a direct
approach to Halifax because it was flying too high and was too
heavy with 30 tons (27 metric tons) of fuel. The call was made 70
miles (115 kilometers) out of Halifax, but the pilots would have
needed 130 miles (210 kilometers) to make a direct landing,
Swissair said.
	   Alan Wolk, a U.S. pilot and aviation lawyer, said Sunday that
Flight 111's pilot, Urs Zimmermann, should have begun a direct
emergency descent sooner.
	   ``The MD-11 could have been landed overweight without
difficulty,'' Wolk said. ``We have learned from aircraft fires
historically that the only procedure that has a prayer of avoiding
an accident is the quickest possible descent and landing.''
	   Two relatives of one victim echoed Wolk's opinion Monday as they
visited Peggy's Cove, the tiny fishing village closest to the crash
scene.
	   Cheryl Klein and her brother, Abe, whose father was killed, said
they blamed the pilot for the crash.
	   ``I think he wasted valuable time when he made that big circle
to dump (fuel),'' said Cheryl. ``I think he should have just tried
to land.''
	   Several hundred family members have come to the area to visit
Peggy's Cove, attend memorial services and assist medical teams in
trying to identify badly fragmented human remains retrieved by
searchers.
	   More than 1,400 military personnel are involved in the search,
and more than 200 stress counselors have been assigned to support
them during their often grisly work.
	   ``Some of the stuff they're being exposed to is truly
horrible,'' said Mary Anne Murphy, a Coast Guard spokeswoman.
	   At the Shearwater military air base near Halifax, relatives have
been invited to look at personal effects found by the search team.
	   Claire Mortimer, 45, of Berkeley, California, said she went
there hoping to find her stepmother's ring, and instead found the
wallet of her father, former New York Times executive John
Mortimer.
	   ``It was a very wrenching experience,'' she said.
	   A memorial service was held late Monday for families and
colleagues of Flight 111's crew at the Roman Catholic church in
Kloten, next to Zurich airport.
	   Another memorial service was planned for Tuesday in Nairobi,
Kenya, to honor Pierce Gerety, 56, an American who directed relief
operations in central Africa for the U.N. High Commissioner of
Refugees.

Explosions in Macau street injure 14
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MACAU (AP) - A parked car and a motorcycle exploded in a Macau
street early Tuesday, injuring 14 people, police said.
	   Witnesses said the car exploded first. When police and
journalists gathered at the scene, a blast from a nearby motorcycle
caused the injuries.
	   Among those injured were four police officers. The rest were
mostly journalists.
	   The motive for the explosions, which occurred after 1 a.m. (1700
GMT) was not known, but Macau has been rocked by a wave of gang
crimes in recent months.
	   Three government officials, including a gambling inspector, have
been killed since March.
	   Police believe the violence is triggered by gangs fighting over
gambling profits that have been shrinking because of Asia's
economic slump.
	   Macau, 40 miles (70 kilometers) west of Hong Kong, reverts to
Chinese rule next year. A popular tourist and gambling enclave at
the tip of south China, Macau has a population of about 450,000.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire tied Roger Maris' major league
record with his 61st homer of the season, leading the St. Louis
Cardinals over the Chicago Cubs 3-2 Monday.
	   McGwire, who has 19 games remaining to break the record,
connected in the first inning against Mike Morgan (0-1). McGwire,
2-for-4 with a single and the homer, is three homers ahead of
Chicago's Sammy Sosa, who went 1-for-5 with a single.
	   Darren Oliver (3-2) allowed one run and six hits in 6 1-3
innings, and Juan Acevedo got his sixth save. Chicago dropped into
a tie with the Mets in the NL wild-card race.
 &UR; Mets 8, Braves 7
	   In New York, Edgardo Alfonzo hit a two-run homer off John Rocker
(1-2) with two outs in the eighth as New York rallied from a 7-6
deficit.
	   Greg McMichael (3-4), the Mets' fourth reliever, pitched the
eighth and John Franco worked the ninth for his 33rd save.
	   Luis Lopez matched a career-high with four RBIs and Tony
Phillips homered for the Mets. A violent thunderstorm caused a
1-hour, 48-minute rain delay in the fourth inning.
 &UR; Rockies 15, Marlins 10
	   In Denver, Larry Walker hit two solo homers, going 3-for-4 and
increased his NL-leading batting average to .354. Vinny Castilla
went 4-for-5 with his 42nd homer and three RBIs.
	   Colorado tied a season-high with 15 runs and matched a franchise
record with 21 hits. Castilla's sixth-inning homer off Eric Ludwick
(1-4) came after a walk to Walker and put the Rockies ahead 11-10.
	   Curtis Leskanic (6-3) won despite allowing two runs in two
innings.
 &UR; Brewers 6, Pirates 3
	   In Pittsburgh, Marc Newfield's two-run pinch-homer broke a
seventh-inning tie, and Pittsburgh lost for the ninth time in 10
games. Dave Nilsson also hit a two-run homer off Elmer Dessens
(2-3), Nilsson's first since July 13.
	   Brewers rookie Rafael Roque (4-1) allowed all three runs but
just two hits in six innings, and Bob Wickman got his 22nd save.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin suffered blows on several fronts
Monday when lawmakers rejected his candidate for prime minister a
second time, throwing Russia into even deeper political turmoil as
the economy hurtles out of control. The ruble crashed again
dramatically and the Central Bank chairman offered to quit. Some
Russians flocked to stores to buy goods before prices shoot up any
higher. ``The economic crisis is gaining momentum with catastrophic
speed,'' acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin warned the State
Duma before the lower house of parliament torpedoed his nomination
273-138. If the Duma rejects the Yeltsin's choice a third time, the
constitution requires the president to dissolve parliament and call
new elections. (RUSSIA-POLITICS)
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ The flight-data recorder recovered
by divers near the wreckage of Swissair Flight 111 contains no
information for the six crucial minutes before the plane crashed,
investigators said Monday. The setback offset good news from the
search operation: a Canadian navy submarine detected a signal from
the plane's other ``black box'' _ the cockpit-voice recorder. The
chief crash investigator, Vic Gerden, said the flight-data recorder
retrieved Sunday was in good condition and should provide more than
100 types of information ranging from altitude and airspeed to
whether the plane's smoke warning lights were on. Gerden said the
data recording stopped once the plane dipped below 10,000 feet
(3,050 meters). A strong possibility, he said, was that the plane
lost electrical power at this stage. Divers also were trying to
confirm if three large pieces of wreckage found near the flight
data recorder are sections of the plane's fuselage.
(CANADA-SWISSAIR CRASH)
	   VICTORIA FALLS, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Rebel leaders and the Congolese
government they are trying to unseat reached a breakthrough in
peace talks Monday, said Zambian President Frederick Chiluba,
chairman of the peace summit. Chiluba refused to give details and
would not comment on whether a cease-fire had been reached, but
said there was an agreement. Chiluba said the group of regional
presidents will reconvene Tuesday for further deliberations before
issuing further information. Before the presidents began talks,
officials huddled in meetings seeking a way to allow all the
warring factions to discuss terms of a cease-fire and withdrawal of
all foreign troops. They also discussed the establishment of an
African peacekeeping force, possibly under the Organization of
African Unity. (ZIMBABWE-CONGO-PEACE TALKS)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Military police fired hundreds of
rounds into the air to disperse protesters Monday, after strongman
Hun Sen launched a crackdown against his political opponents. Hun
Sen ordered anti-government protests in the capital to end by
midnight and called for the arrest of opposition leader Sam Rainsy,
blaming him for a grenade attack on his home Monday. After three
minutes of intense firing outside the luxury Cambodiana hotel,
protesters had cleared the area, but later returned. Police charged
the crowd repeatedly, scattering the demonstrators, who returned
again and again. One man was killed and at least three were
injured. The government reversed the midnight deadline at the last
minute after a government official, Prum Sokha, met with opposition
representatives and U.N. officials in the Cambodiana hotel.
(CAMBODIA)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Security forces used batons and
shields to push hundreds of students from the grounds of Parliament
early Tuesday after demonstrators tore down its gates in protest
against President B.J. Habibie. The protest, which began Monday,
was the biggest outside the legislature since a marathon student
sit-in there helped force Habibie's autocratic predecessor,
ex-President Suharto, to step down four months ago. Student leaders
claimed that 10 demonstrators were injured in the clash, which took
place more than 12 hours after about 2,000 marched on the
Parliament. A police spokesman said five officers were injured.
There have been riots around Indonesia over the last two weeks.
(INDONESIA-PROTEST)
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic said
Monday he would consider an international investigation into
atrocities in Kosovo province but refused U.S. appeals to allow
immediate access to the region. American envoy John Shattuck said
after talks with Milosevic that the Yugoslav leader ``showed
interest'' in letting independent investigators look into evidence
of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the besieged Serbian
province. Hundreds of people have died in Kosovo and an estimated
265,000 have been driven from their homes in a crackdown on ethnic
Albanian rebels. Shattuck said the need for an independent
investigation was urgent and ``crystal clear.'' (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

	   LONDON (AP) _ Pregnant Spice Girl Mel B _ Scary to the fans _
says she and similarly expectant Posh Spice Victoria Adams battled
to remain cheerful when morning sickness hit.
	   ``We both turned into dragons, it was quite funny,'' she said in
an interview with British Broadcasting Corp. radio, the first time
she has spoken about her pregnancy.
	   She was coy about plans to marry her boyfriend, dancer Jimmy
Gulzar, pointing out that the four-girl group has only just
returned from a successul American tour, ``so I haven't sorted it
out yet.''
	   ``We want to get married before Christmas but not this soon.''
Adams and fiance, Manchester United and England soccer star David
Beckham, plan to marry next year.
	   Scary told interviewer Jo Whiley that she knew ``in the first
week'' that she had conceived.
	   ``I am absolutely over the moon. I am three months and a couple
of weeks pregnant,'' she said.
	   Posh Spice was ``a couple of weeks ahead'' of her, she said.
``It is nice having a close friend going through the same things
you are.''
	   On cravings, she admitted to ``eating peanut butter nearly every
day and I have a thing for cheesecake and ice cream.''
	   The Spice Girls will be writing and recording their third album
through the final stages of her pregnancy. Scary said she also
plans to record her own solo album in the coming months.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Decked out in black from her eyeliner to
her platform sandals, a chain-smoking Grace Slick pondered the
cosmos.
	   ``Charles Manson has almost the same birth sign as me. He has
about five signs in Scorpio and I have about four,'' the Jefferson
Airplane singer told the San Francisco Chronicle.
	   ``So I'm real close to being Charles. Except I can't think of
anybody I care enough about to kill. I'd rather keep them alive and
torture them. Call them every morning at 4 a.m. for the rest of
their lives,'' she said.
	   Slick, 58, was part of the psychedelic scene that grew from a
San Francisco phenomenon into an international movement, then
became one of the few 1960s stars to weather the '70s by helping to
transform the band into Jefferson Starship.
	   And she's lived to tell the story in an autobiography,
``Somebody to Love?,'' published this month by Warner Books and
written with friend Andrea Cagan.
	   The literary venture wasn't exactly her idea, though.
	   ``I didn't want to write a book. They made me do it,'' she said.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Barbra Streisand is talking with director Mike
Nichols about staging her ``final'' world concert tour, according
to the New York Post.
	   Nichols, who directed ``The Graduate'' and ``Working Girl''
among other films, plans to piece together a movie of the tour if
the deal goes through, the Post reported Monday.
	   ``They are definitely talking. Barbra would love Mike to direct
her last concert tour,'' the newspaper quoted an unidentified
source as saying.
	   Streisand's handlers said the singer is ``considering several
possibilities'' to perform again.
	   ``Many attractive offers from around the world have been
received, and the possibility of touring again is being
contemplated,'' said Marty Erlichman, Streisand's longtime manager.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ John Travolta reveals in a new biography that
his mother had one sure-fire way to get him to do chores: Pin any
request on Jimmy Cagney.
	   ``He was the only one outside my family who was a main source of
inspiration,'' Travolta says in ``Travolta: The Life,'' written by
Nigel Andrews.
	   Travolta says in the book that he would sit in front of the
television set whenever an old Cagney musical came on and step
along when Cagney did his tap dance routine, ``I'm a Yankee Doodle
Dandy.''
	   Travolta's mother seized on the fascination as a way to get her
son to brush his teeth.
	   According to Andrews' book, she would pretend to be talking to
Cagney on the telephone, and tell her son that ``Mr. Cagney is
calling. He wants you to brush your teeth and tidy your room.''
	   Travolta reportedly would agree and then ask: ``Does he ... does
he like me?''

More diverse economy brings new era in Alaska

	   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) _ A decade ago, when oil prices tanked,
so did Alaska's economy. House values dropped by half in Alaska's
largest city and unemployment shot up.
	   Oil prices are down again, but the state is setting employment
records and the economy is cruising along.
	   This time, new technology has sharply cut the cost of producing
oil. And Alaska's economy has become a little less dependent on oil
and a little more like the rest of the nation in creating larger
retail and service industries.
	   About four years ago, the Anchorage area, with about half the
state's population, began a retail building boom that hasn't eased
yet. Kmart, Wal-Mart, Costco and Home Depot all have opened stores
in the state in the past five years.
	   This month, The Gap opened its first Alaska store, in Anchorage.
Longtime Alaskans pointed to that as a sign that the old Alaska,
where Sears passed for a fancy store, was gone forever.
	   Lifestyles clearly have changed in the Last Frontier.
	   ``People didn't use to get outdoors in the winter time,'' said
Jack Roderick, who moved to Alaska in 1954 and was Anchorage mayor
during the 1970s. ``That was a big deal. You'd sort of hunker down.
People who could afford it would go to Seattle, and people who
couldn't would stay and shoot their moose'' to fill the freezer.
	   ``Now we have bike paths and ski trails and outdoor skating.
It's a whole different psychology,'' Roderick said.
	   Alaska's economy has been based on its vast wealth of natural
resources since the United States bought the territory from Russia
in 1867. That has meant sharp boom-and-bust cycles, pegged to the
price of gold, fish, timber and finally oil.
	   But the state, especially Anchorage, has changed in the past
decade, said Neil Fried, an economist with the state Labor
Department. The cost of living, while still high compared with
standards in the lower 48 states, has moderated, he said.
	   Unemployment dropped to 5.2 percent in July, a record low for
the month. It was down from 6 percent in June and 6.7 percent for
July 1997. The nationwide rate for July was 4.5 percent.
	   A raft of rosy news this month, in Alaska's oil patch and
elsewhere, has helped cushion the blows of a weak Japanese economy
and two years of poor salmon runs in Bristol Bay.
	   _ Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt cleared the way for broader
oil exploration in part of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska,
an Indiana-sized patch of land near oil-rich Prudhoe Bay that could
hold billions of barrels of crude.
	   _ Arco Alaska Inc. and four partners said they would spend up to
dlrs 100 million during the next four years to study whether a
natural gas pipeline should be built from the North Slope to the
ice-free port of Valdez.
	   _ Anadarko Petroleum Corp. signed a deal with the Arctic Slope
Regional Corp., the North Slope's Native corporation, to explore
for oil on 3.3 million acres south of the Prudhoe Bay oil complex.
	   All this interest in Alaska comes at a time when oil prices are
near historic lows, adjusted for inflation, hovering around dlrs
12.50 a barrel.
	   What's been happening, at least for the oil companies, is
starkly different from 1986, when low prices began years of
retrenchment and cost cutting.
	   Payrolls dropped along with Anchorage property values, and by
1994 they were leaner and ready to begin exploiting the
cost-cutting technologies they were forced to develop in the tough
times, said Roger Herrera, a former British Petroleum executive.
	   Breakthroughs such as three-dimensional seismic interpretation,
powered by computers too expensive for the oil companies to use
routinely a decade ago, have cut the cost of producing on the North
Slope from more than dlrs 10 a barrel in the 1980s to about dlrs 4
a barrel today.
	   ``Until the price of oil goes up again, nobody's going to
realize the benefits of what's been happening,'' Herrera said.

Nurse invents `birthwear'

<TEXT>
	   CHARLESTON, West Virginia (AP) _ Carolyn Keyes has helped
hundreds of babies come into the world, but now she's delivering
something else: style.
	   Keyes has been a part-time labor and delivery nurse at Holzer
Medical Center in Gallipolis, Ohio, since 1973. She designed and
began selling Yokeyes Birthwear after years of hearing expectant
mothers complain about traditional hospital gowns.
	   Her outfits give women in labor coverage and dignity.
	   ``If you can imagine the repetitiveness of people saying, 'Gosh
I wish I had something to cover me up.' From that, I thought to
create some birthwear,'' Keyes said from her New Haven home.
	   The gestation period for Yokeyes _ the all-cotton, oversized
shorts and shirt _ was about five years. Keyes opened Yokeyes
Birthwear Inc. in August 1997, and sold the first set in May to
Chrystal Stamper.
	   ``The Yokeyes covered me a lot and made me feel a lot more
comfortable,'' said Stamper, 36. ``I had shorts on clear up until
my water broke. ...I think it's a great idea.''
	   Snaps down the back, sleeves and legs of the garment allow
doctors easy access to do vaginal exams, hook up equipment such as
heart monitors and administer anesthesia and other medication.
	   Dr. Rick St. Onge, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at the
Holzer Clinic of Ohio, had one patient who wore the birthwear.
	   ``From a physician's point of view, it doesn't matter what the
patients are wearing as long as the patients are comfortable, and
my patient seemed very comfortable,'' St. Onge said.
	   ``It allowed her to have some modesty at a time when modesty is
hard to find.''
	   Work on the idea started in 1993, when Keyes told her husband,
Jerry, she wanted to develop the birthwear.
	   The couple had no experience in business, so step one was coming
up with a catchy name. The trademark is a combination of the word
``yoke,'' meaning to join, and Keyes' last name. The clothes are
white and adorned with the name, the male and female symbols, and
pink and blue baby footprints.
	   ``When you try to develop something, you're like a sponge,''
Keyes said. ``Everything you hear, you try to incorporate that.''
	   With dlrs 40,000 in the bank, an idea and ambition, Yokeyes was
conceived.
	   The Keyes searched the Internet and found a manufacturer in
Lynchburg, Virginia, to produce a few dozen sets.
	   Soon, the business became a family affair. Keyes' 10-year-old
daughter, Bethany, starred in local radio ads and son Chris, 21,
marketed the product in Orlando, Florida.
	   The birthwear line was recently expanded to include T-shirts for
dads-to-be. ``Proud Father'' and the Yokeyes symbol are printed
below the image of a fetal-heart monitor printout with a space to
fill in the baby's vital statistics.
	   Keyes got ``a chance of a lifetime'' when Gilberto Oliver wore
the Yokeyes T-shirt while his wife, Elizabeth, gave birth June 16
live on the Internet.
	   Television cameras rolled as the Olivers' son, Sean, had his
footprints inked on the shirt, and the Yokeyes web site received
2,000 visits from all over the world, Keyes said.
	   But while the site is getting hundreds of visitors a month and
the T-shirts are selling by the dozens, Yokeyes sales are slow.
Only 17 have been ordered since May.
	   ``I would like to make the money I put into it but the main
thing is getting the word out and helping the women who give
birth,'' she said.

Once a world leader in cacao, Venezuela trying for comeback
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD BRAND &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ They called it the ``champagne of
chocolate.''
	   Venezuela's cacao used to be among the world's most acclaimed.
But when the South American nation discovered giant reserves of oil
in the 1920s, the cacao industry dwindled.
	   Now Venezuela wants to bring it back to world-class prominence,
mainly by pulling government regulators off the backs of cacao
producers.
	   ``Venezuela's cacao is the best in the world,'' said exporter
Jorge Redmond, owner of El Rey (The King) chocolate company. ``And
I don't think we've yet seen the golden age.''
	   Venezuela was the world's top exporter of cacao to Europe in the
17th and 18th centuries, according to the American Cocoa Research
Institute in McLean, Virginia. European countries imported
Venezuelan cacao by the shipload, and African countries
transplanted it and starting growing their own.
	   Today, Venezuelan cacao accounts for just 0.5 percent of the
world total. Growers have a plan to boost their share back up to
about 3 percent within two decades, which would make Venezuela the
world's seventh-largest producer and the fourth-largest producer of
fine cacao, according to the Venezuelan National Cacao Fund.
	   Last November, officials approved a plan under which cacao
producers will pool dlrs 400 million and create their own private
corporation to promote and organize the industry.
	   The corporation, called ``Plan Cacao,'' will replace the
government's cacao fund. Officials aren't complaining.
	   ``It's a necessary measure to be competitive,'' said Nestor
Avila, the fund's president.
	   The idea is to use Venezuelan cacao's reputation for outstanding
quality to capture upscale markets worldwide. Already, high-end
confectioners such as France's Valrhona and Richart are purchasing
as much Venezuelan cacao as they can.
	   Lately, Venezuela has been reserving its finest beans for Asia,
a new but discriminating market, and for chocolate destined for
top-flight restaurants in New York, Paris, Tokyo and other cities.
	   Despite the high quality of Venezuela's cacao, the global market
is controlled mainly by West African nations. And Venezuela's
output per hectare is among the world's lowest, according to the
National Cacao Fund.
	   Cacao producers blame the government for the decline.
	   ``For a long time, the industry was run by people who knew very
little about making cacao,'' said cacao grower Kai Rosenberg. ``It
was nothing short of a disaster.''
	   Cacao producers could sell their beans only to the government,
which set prices too low to make a profit or too high to market,
said Redmond.
	   In the 1950s, the government also carried out a land reform
program that split up huge cacao plantations into small parcels.
That proved disastrous, too, since cacao does not lend itself to
small-scale production, Rosenberg said.
	   Cacao trees, which grow 12 to 20 feet (4 to 7 meters) high, take
about six years to yield their beans.
	   The government's solution now: Get itself out of the picture.
	   In recent years it eliminated price controls and allowed
producers to sell cacao to whomever they want. Other regulations
and subsidies went by the wayside, too.
	   Plan Cacao calls for quadrupling production to 54,000 metric
tons a year of mainly high-end strains of beans from the current
13,000 metric tons within the next 17 years. The cacao workforce
also would quadruple, going up to 70,000 workers.
	   Meanwhile, scientists have already begun working to improve the
quality and profitability of Venezuela's cacao strains.
	   Venezuelan growers say the time is right for action. Chocolate
consumption worldwide is growing by 3 percent a year, while
production is increasing by only 1.5 percent, according to the
American Cocoa Research Institute.
	   A lack of rain in top producer Ivory Coast is hurting the
1997-98 crop, and some experts predict rising prices and falling
supply within 10 years.

Sampras, rain dominate on Labor Day at U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS; ADDS Williams, Sampras quotes; will be UPDATED after
Agassi-Kucera match. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Pete Sampras strolled off the court after
overpowering yet another young challenger. Venus Williams strutted
in victory, pumping up the crowd with an on-court dance that looked
like an NFL end zone celebration.
	   On a Monday when thunderstorms turned the U.S. Open into
Wimbledon West, Sampras and Williams reached the quarterfinals with
convincing wins over dangerous opponents.
	   Sampras had 18 aces and never lost his serve in a 6-4, 6-3, 6-2
win that included a 2 1/4-hour rain break, turning his power lunch
with Marat Safin into a late-afternoon snack for the world's top
player.
	   ``I was cracking it pretty hard throughout the match,'' Sampras
said. ``I got the serve going, which has been a little bit up and
down throughout this past week. Today it seemed like it clicked.''
	   The top-seeded Sampras, a four-time U.S. Open champion, next
will face the winner of a match between No. 8 Andre Agassi and No.
9 Karol Kucera.
	   Williams won the final six points of the tiebreaker in her 6-1,
7-6 (7-4) win over No. 12 Mary Pierce, celebrating her win by
shimmying to the net.
	   ``I really shouldn't have done the dance, I should have waited
until later,'' she said. ``I didn't plan to do the dance. I planned
to win the second set really easy.''
	   Sampras lost only 20 points on his serve in the match and closed
out his 600th career win with three consecutive aces _ including
one at 135 mph (217 kph). He won 41 of 48 points on his first serve
in the match.
	   Safin, 18, who wowed crowds at this year's French Open with a
string of upsets en route to the fourth round in his Grand Slam
debut, showed off plenty of power, including 10 aces. But he was no
match for the steady Sampras.
	   ``He's very talented, but also very young. The first set I
couldn't believe the pace of his serve, I really had a hard time
reading it. The talent is there, maybe he just needs to tone it
down a little bit,'' Sampras said. ``He's 18 years old and he's got
plenty of years to learn from mistakes. My game at 18 was pretty
bad.''
	   Sampras was 19 when he won the U.S. Open for the first time.
	   Williams took advantage of 19 unforced errors and two double
faults to win the first set in 24 minutes against Pierce, who twice
had her wrist treated by a trainer. Pierce was down a break in the
second set when rain interrupted play.
	   Pierce was a different player after the break, and so was
Williams _ who had 31 unforced errors in the second set, as
compared to just two in the first set. The second set lasted 1
hour, 11 minutes.
	   The second set was tied 5-5 when Williams and Pierce played the
game of the match. It lasted 13 minutes, 57 seconds and ended when
Williams converted her seventh break point to take a 6-5 lead.
	   Pierce broke right back and took a 4-1 lead in the tiebreaker,
but didn't get another point in the match.
	   Already overshadowed by Mark McGwire's chase for the home-run
record, the tournament almost had its Labor Day showcase washed
away as thunderstorms and strong winds gave the courts all the
charm of a car wash.
	   With tornadoes touching down nearby, players were forced off the
courts as the sky turned pitch black in mid-afternoon
	   ``It was a scary sight, it was like green out there,'' Sampras
said of the stormy sky. ``Maybe it was going to rain money.''
	   The rain returned at night, delaying some matches by an
additional half hour.
	   The earlier batch of bad weather came just after the day's
biggest sports moment, McGwire's 61st homer in St. Louis. The feat
was not announced to the tennis crowd, although a big roar could be
heard from Shea Stadium across the subway tracks, where the Mets
were playing Atlanta.
	   The only singles match completed before the rain was a marathon
fourth-round women's contest in which No. 13 Amanda Coetzer slammed
a backhand passing shot down the line on match point to win 6-4,
4-6, 6-2 over No. 7 Conchita Martinez.
	   With Coetzer and Martinez engaging in long baseline rallies and
occasionally hitting moonballs, the match lasted 2 hours, 39
minutes. One game had 28 points, including 11 deuces, and consumed
more than 20 minutes. The second set alone, at 1:16, was only one
minute shorter than the entire Sampras-Safin match.

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS and UPDATES with Sampras quote on weather &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ One game lasted more than 20 minutes. One set
lasted 76 minutes. The whole match outlasted two others on another
court.
	   ``I thought it was a long match,'' Conchita Martinez said after
13th-seeded Amanda Coetzer beat her 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 to advance to the
quarterfinals of the U.S. Open Monday.
	   The match lasted 2 hours, 39 minutes. It seemed longer, with
both players content to stand beyond the baseline and send looping
shots back and forth for long _ very long _ points.
	   The second game of the second set took 20 minutes, 25 seconds,
longer than an entire set of many other matches.
	   It included 28 points, had 11 deuces and long rallies. It only
served to even the set at 1-1.
	   The 1-hour, 16-minute second set was 10 minutes longer than it
took Patrick Rafter to beat David Nainkin on the men's side in
three sets.
	   Martinez, seeded seventh, had a neck injury that required
on-court treatment in the first set, adding more time. It also kept
her from playing an aggressive game.
	   ``If you would have seen me yesterday, you would have said
`There's no way she's going to go on court,' '' Martinez said. ``I
got two injections. I got a lot of treatment.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; WEATHER WATCH: The heavy thunderstorm that stopped play for 2
hours, 20 minutes arrived quickly and sent people scurrying.
	   The skies darkened, causing the lights to be turned on in the
middle of the afternoon.
	   ``It was a scary sight,'' said Pete Sampras, who was in the
middle of a 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 victory over Marat Safin when the storm
hit. ``It was like, green out there. Maybe it was going to rain
money.''
	   The wind came first, sending anything not fastened down flying
around the court, causing delays as ballboys tried to chase things
down.
	   Then the thunder and lightening came and the stadium cleared in
a few minutes as the people found shelter.
	   At least there were no tarps to cover the hard courts, as they
have at Wimbledon to protect the grass or the French Open to cover
the clay.
	   A few hundred yards away at Shea Stadium, they were having
problems keeping things covered. The violent storm with strong
winds forced New York Mets manager Bobby Valentine and his coaches
and ballboys to kneel or lay on the tarp over the infield when an
air bubble under tarp picked up the covering.
	   There was no apparent around the tennis grounds, although the
temperature dropped 22 degrees after the storm, from 89 to 67.
	   Once the rains stopped, the courts was dried by hand, with more
than 25 court attendants with towels wiping down the main court in
Arthur Ashe Stadium.
	   Meanwhile, inside the player's lounge, the TVs were turned to
another sport _ the Mark McGwire home-run watch.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DOUBLES LOSERS: For the second year in a row at the U.S. Open,
the top doubles team of Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge made an
early exit.
	   The Woodies lost in the third round to Cyril Suk and Sandon
Stolle, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5.
	   Last year, the Australians went out in the first round, ending a
streak of five consecutive Grand Slam tournament finals. In all
they have won nine Grand Slam doubles titles together, including
five straight Wimbledons.
	   It will be the first time since 1991 they have not won at least
one Grand Slam doubles titles, losing in the Australian Open and
Wimbledon finals and the round of 16 at the French this year.
	   ``We have high expectations, high standards,'' said Woodforde.
``We have to keep them up, otherwise you start sort of shuffling
down in the pack.''

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Thirty years after landmark student protests,
a newspaper Monday published photos of President Ernesto Zedillo as
a youth apparently being beaten by police.
	   The president acknowledged that he was the 16-year-old student
pictured in photos taken during demonstrations in July 1968. The
pictures were found by El Universal in its archives.
	   One photo, published at the time, showed a soldier appearing to
beat a young man backed against a wall. The other unpublished one
showed Zedillo arguing with five armed soldiers.
	   ``I was a moderate student, but despite that the riot police
sprayed us with blows,'' El Universal quoted Zedillo as saying in
1994.
	   Zedillo has credited the 1968 student movement with beginning a
process in which Mexico has become more democratic.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A top official in Mexico's tourism ministry
has gone on leave to defend himself against allegations he
misappropriated dlrs 8 million dollars at a previous post,
newspapers reported Monday.
	   Manuel Merino Garcia, who was chief administrator of Mexico
City's last government, already has been banned from office in the
Mexico City government for 20 years and fined the equivalent of
dlrs 24 million.
	   In a letter announcing his leave as chief administrator in the
federal tourism ministry, he insisted he was innocent. He called
the accusations politically motivated.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Eight whales surprised Argentine
beach goers over the weekend, twirling and swimming in waters off a
central coastal town.
	   As word spread of the animals' sighting, some 1,000 people
gathered at Serena beach just south of Mar Del Plata, a resort town
395 kms (250 miles) southeast of Buenos Aires.
	   The whales are believed to be part of the thousands which gather
every year to mate off a southern Argentine peninsula. Scientists
say this has been a record mating year for the animals.
	   ___
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Villagers lynched and burned two women and
a man accused of robbing a house and shooting at pursuers as they
tried to escape, police said Monday.
	   Police said villagers in Santa Lucia Utatlan, some 50 miles (80
kilometers) west of the capital, found the three in the act of
robbing a house on Sunday and chased them. As they fled, the
suspects fired at their pursuers, wounding three.
	   Guatemala has seen numerous lynchings in recent years by
villagers fed up with crime. Last week, a mob of some 3,000 people
in Quebrada Seca in Alta Verapaz province killed three alleged
criminals.
	   ___
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ Nicaragua's Supreme Court is planning to
ask Costa Rica to help gather evidence against a U.S. citizen who
allegedly flew a stolen plane from Florida to Nicaragua, where it
was used by the country's president.
	   President Arnoldo Aleman said he did not know the plane was
stolen and may have been used to transport drugs from Colombia.
	   A court spokesman said the tribunal will send a request Tuesday
to Costa Rica asking that authorities there open a bank
safe-deposit box belonging to Jose Francisco Guash Rodriguez, the
man who allegedly flew the Lear 35-A jet to Nicaragua.
	   The government was offered the use of the plane and Aleman flew
in it Feb. 4 to a meeting of Central American presidents in El
Salvador.
	   In April, the plane was flown to Medellin, Colombia, where
authorities suspect it was used to smuggle drugs. Traces of cocaine
were found inside.
	   Guash Rodriguez is charged with drug trafficking, conspiracy and
piracy.

His every move scrutinized, McGwire feels the pressure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By TED ANTHONY &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ They watch his batting practice under
baseball-expert microscopes, searching for signs, omens, anything.
They wear his jersey by the thousands and cheer each time he takes
the field. And the probing questions soar faster than the home runs
_ about every at-bat, every swing, every pitch, every thought.
	   Mark David McGwire, baseball's latest superhuman human, is a man
under pressure _ a 34-year-old St. Louis Cardinal who, in these
past several days on the path to homer No. 61, which he hit Monday,
is the most scrutinized athlete on the planet. Being left alone,
for the most part, is a thing of the past.
	   ``It's been a long, rough road,'' McGwire said after the game.
	   Adoration and fame are his, yes, but it's hardly an easy
position to be in. How would you like seemingly every member of the
public critiquing how you're doing your job? How would you like
radio announcers, sportswriters, TV anchors dissecting your
performance at every turn? And Mark McGwire's not even a
politician.
	   ``Give him some space,'' implores Kevin Hallinan, major league
baseball's head of security.
	   To hear McGwire tell it, he's a rank-and-file ballplayer.
	   ``I would rather just go about my business,'' he says. ``I do
have a claustrophobic kind of feeling all the time.''
	   This year, the attention started at the beginning of the season.
Even then, asked about home runs, McGwire was often reticent and
required some cajoling. He loosens up some now and then _ friendly
but still very, very guarded.
	   The pressure has gotten to him only occasionally. On Aug. 29, he
argued a rookie umpire's called third strike in a game against
Atlanta and was ejected _ a true anomaly. And reports that he has
used a legal performance-enhancing substance called androstenedione
have rendered him prickly in recent days.
	   Friday afternoon was a familiar sight: McGwire, before the game,
alone at his locker with an intense expression on his face, reading
a Sports Illustrated cover story about him. No one dared approach;
he was sending major go-away vibes and canceled a scheduled news
conference.
	   Even batting practice has become a source of pressure. Thousands
show up early to see him swing for the fences, and they want
action: When first-base coach Dave McKay threw McGwire an outside
pitch Monday, he was booed roundly _ in batting practice, no less.
McKay tossed up his arms in mock exasperation. It got so bad that
at one point a few weeks ago, he, even likened batting practice to
feeling like a ``caged animal''
	   Yet on Monday morning, with 60 homers behind him and _ though he
didn't know it _ one ahead of him that day, he seemed relaxed and
easy, joking and high-fiving with fellow home-run hitter Sammy Sosa
at a pre-game news conference and flashing his now-famous goateed
grin.
	   And when he hit No. 61 in the first inning, he grinned his way
around the bases before hoisting his 10-year-old son, Matthew,
triumphantly in the air.
	   ``I felt very calm today,'' he said afterward. ``You try to tell
yourself to sit back and relax, but it's hard to. I'm a human
being. I have emotions like everybody else.''
	   Apparently this is a guy who can handle it _ at least when he
needs to.
	   ``This is not somebody that just came up and did this and you
can say, `What an aberration,''' said commissioner Bud Selig.
	   Though people often compare him to Ruth, who shared his
larger-than-life aura, McGwire clearly has some of Maris' suspicion
of the world around him _ sometimes all around him. And, like
Maris, part of McGwire will undoubtedly be relieved when this
season of seasons ends.
	   ``That was a tough season for him,'' said Roger Maris Jr. ``When
the season was over, it was a big sigh of relief for him. I think
he felt good that that was behind him.''

Recession forces government budget into deficit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The Asian contagion and falling
commodity prices will push the New Zealand's government budget into
deficit over the next two years, after earlier forecasts predicted
solid surpluses, the government said Tuesday.
	   The latest forecast points to a bleak short-term outlook for a
weakened economy, which will also force unemployment rates higher.
But it also predicts a return to growth within a year.
	   Releasing the new projection, Finance Minister Bill Birch
confirmed the economy is in recession and will shrink by half a
percent in the current financial year, down from the projected
growth rate of 2.9 percent.
	   While the economy is projected to contract this year, ending
June 30, 1999, it would bounce back to 2.9 percent growth in next
year and 4 percent in 2001.
	   Birch said this would occur because the lower value of the
currency would increase New Zealand's competitiveness.
	   Unemployment, currently at 7.7 percent, is expected to continue
rising and peak at 8.5 percent by early next year.
	   After five years of budget surplus, Birch is now projecting a
budget deficit of New Zealand dollars 700 million (U.S. dlrs 351
million) instead of a New Zealand 2 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.1 billion)
surplus next year.
	   The New Zealand dollars 3 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.5 billion)
surplus projected for 2001 has become a New Zealand dollars 300
(U.S. dlrs 150 million) deficit.
	   The New Zealand economy had been resilient, ``considering the
Asian crisis has created the worst international trading
environment in more than two decades,'' Birch said.
	   ``Asia, which took 40 percent of New Zealand exports last year,
is suffering massive economic losses. The impact is spilling over
into Russia, and is to some extent affecting emerging markets now
throughout the world,'' he added.
	   New Zealand's liberalized economy responds more quickly to
global circumstances and major movements in exchange, said Birch.
	   The new economic and fiscal outlook predicts household spending
will be more cautious, with householders more likely to repay debt
or save money than to spend it.
	   The inflation rate is expected to remain below 1.5 percent until
mid-2000.

Milosevic stands ground in Kosovo crackdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous with new material &QL; 
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Rebuffing the latest Western demands
to halt the fighting in Kosovo, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic insisted he has no intention of calling off his troops
battling ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   After talks Monday with U.S. officials in Belgrade, Milosevic
issued a statement declaring he had stressed that ``terrorism in
Kosovo will be suppressed and eliminated.''
	   He called anew for international condemnation of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which Yugoslav and Serb forces have tried to crush
during a six-month assault in the secessionist province.
	   The visiting officials, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State John
Shattuck and former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, were the latest in a parade
of Western dignitaries to Belgrade to urge Milosevic to stop the
bloodshed.
	   Shattuck and Dole reiterated calls for an end to the Serb
offensive in Kosovo, where hundreds of people have died and an
estimated 265,000 have been driven from their homes. The two
demanded a pullback of government forces so refugees could return
to their homes.
	   Shattuck, a human rights specialist, said the Yugoslav leader
``showed interest'' in letting independent investigators look into
evidence of war crimes and crimes against humanity, but did not
comply with their appeal to allow experts immediate access to
alleged massacre sites.
	   In an apparent effort to avoid some of the international
criticism, Milosevic's security forces released most of the
approximately 500 men taken captive in the latest offensive against
the KLA.
	   Some of those released told reporters they had been beaten with
sticks and complained they were kept in forests without food and
water for 24 hours. Other local residents said 50 people were still
missing and 17 were killed in the offensive.
	   ``They came and took us in the mountains,'' said Xhavit Rudi, a
30-year-old farmer who was detained near the village of Ponorac.
``They said they would cut us if we ate or drank or went to the
bathroom.''
	   Hundreds of refugees who fled police detention or were released
returned to villages surrounding Ponorac to find many of their
houses and belongings burnt.
	   Western officials estimate that 50,000 people are now living in
hills and forests and at risk of starvation or freezing in winter.
	   Dole, who heads the International Commission for Missing
Persons, said the human rights abuses which have occurred in Kosovo
will be gravely compounded if nothing is done about the refugees
soon.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ During the day, Donald Lee Cary was
often subjected to exhausting marches through rugged mountains. At
night, he lay huddled in a pup tent, his fitful sleep punctured at
times by army mortar fire and warplanes strafing nearby rebel
positions.
	   For the most part, though, the 64-year-old Texas native was
lucky: The only injuries he suffered from his 170 days in captivity
were a possibly fractured rib, shoulder and vertebra, sustained
when he fell in a mountain gorge in May. They have long since
healed.
	   On Monday, a day after leftist rebels released the retired Exxon
executive, Cary said he was weighing whether to remain in his
wife's homeland and whether to sell the 30-cow dairy farm just
outside Bogota where he was kidnapped on March 21.
	   ``We haven't really had time to assess it with our family,''
Cary, who is from Lubbock, Texas, but has lived in Colombia for 19
years, said during an interview in the comfort of his Bogota living
room.
	   He looked fit and relaxed, still wore the gray beard he had
grown to ward off insects, and was about 2 inches trimmer at the
waist.
	   Cary wouldn't discuss the ransom paid for his release. But he
did allow that he had no kidnapping insurance _ unlike most foreign
executives working here _ and now has debts to pay.
	   Cary's captors turned him over to the International Red Cross on
Sunday near Medina, 40 miles (65 kilometers) southeast of Bogota,
in foothills of the eastern cordillera where he was forced to roam
with rebels blamed for the bulk of ransom kidnappings in the Bogota
region.
	   For a time, he was held with four American birdwatchers
kidnapped two days after his capture. Three of them were freed less
than a month later; one escaped earlier.
	   Life on the trail was grueling, uncomfortable and tedious: Cary
was constantly on the move during one 28-day stretch, spending the
night in 26 different places.
	   He had to wash his own clothes and eating utensils and set up
and strike his own tent, while subsisting on a diet rich in rice
and noodles but poor in protein and produce.
	   But his captors from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
or FARC, always treated him with respect.
	   ``I was never mistreated in any way, neither physically nor
psychologically nor verbally,'' Cary said. ``It was in their best
interest to take care of you.'' Kidnapping is a prime revenue
source for the FARC, Colombia's oldest and largest rebel group.
	   Cary's ordeal coincided with a big push by Colombia's new
president, Andres Pastrana, to try to make peace with the
guerrillas, who have been fighting the state for nearly four
decades.
	   Fluent in Spanish, he discussed peace prospects with guerrilla
commanders and found them ``extraordinarily cautious'' about
accepting Pastrana's overtures.
	   Rebel commanders told Cary that they want to take power through
elections but are afraid of being assassinated once they quit the
armed struggle, as has happened with more than 3,000 former rebels
from other movements who demobilized over the past decade.
	   Cary said he also gained insight into the guerrilla struggle and
how it is largely represented by poor peasants.
	   ``There are really great social problems and a lot of these
people come from families where they've been mistreated as children
and they've run away to join the rebels,'' he said, adding that
some guerrillas were so ignorant that they asked him if the United
States and Colombia shared a border.
	   Cary's abduction was not uncommon in a country with the world's
highest kidnapping rate. He was snatched by three gunmen as he left
his farm at dusk on a Saturday night, and driven in his own car
through Bogota.
	   As they were leaving the capital, the gunmen identified
themselves as from the FARC's 53rd Front and Cary knew he would be
away for some time from his wife, Lucia, who has been bedridden for
more than two years with multiple sclerosis.
	   ``I never thought that I had enough (money) to be considered a
kidnap victim,'' Cary said. ``The area where my farm is has never
been subject to any kind of problems of that type. I was the first
one.''
	   With Cary's release, at least eight foreigners remained captive
in Colombia: American Donald W. Riedel, who was seized on Feb. 24,
1997; two Germans, a Frenchman, a Chilean, an Italian, a Canadian
and an Ecuadoran, according to the government.

Recession forces government budget into deficit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to remove extraneous word in 1st graf

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ The Asian contagion and falling
commodity prices will push New Zealand's government budget into
deficit over the next two years, after earlier forecasts predicted
solid surpluses, the government said Tuesday.
	   The latest forecast points to a bleak short-term outlook for a
weakened economy and higher unemployment rates. But it also
predicts a return to growth within a year.
	   Releasing the new projection, Finance Minister Bill Birch
confirmed the economy is in recession and will shrink by half a
percent in the current financial year, down from the projected
growth rate of 2.9 percent.
	   While the economy is projected to contract this year, ending
June 30, 1999, it would bounce back to 2.9 percent growth in next
year and 4 percent in 2001.
	   Birch said this would occur because the lower value of the
currency would increase New Zealand's competitiveness.
	   Unemployment, currently at 7.7 percent, is expected to continue
rising and peak at 8.5 percent by early next year.
	   After five years of budget surplus, Birch is now projecting a
budget deficit of New Zealand dollars 700 million (U.S. dlrs 351
million) instead of a New Zealand 2 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.1 billion)
surplus next year.
	   The New Zealand dollars 3 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.5 billion)
surplus projected for 2001 has become a New Zealand dollars 300
(U.S. dlrs 150 million) deficit.
	   The New Zealand economy had been resilient, ``considering the
Asian crisis has created the worst international trading
environment in more than two decades,'' Birch said.
	   ``Asia, which took 40 percent of New Zealand exports last year,
is suffering massive economic losses. The impact is spilling over
into Russia, and is to some extent affecting emerging markets now
throughout the world,'' he added.
	   New Zealand's liberalized economy responds more quickly to
global circumstances and major movements in exchange, said Birch.
	   The new economic and fiscal outlook predicts household spending
will be more cautious, with householders more likely to repay debt
or save money than to spend it.
	   The inflation rate is expected to remain below 1.5 percent until
mid-2000.

 &UR; IRA dissidents declare `complete cease-fire'

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The Irish Republican Army dissidents
responsible for Northern Ireland's worst-ever terrorist atrocity
called a ``complete'' cease-fire Tuesday but didn't apologize for
their actions.
	   The splinter group, dubbed the Real IRA by journalists and
unwilling to accept the IRA's July 1997 cease-fire, committed the
Aug. 15 car bombing that killed 28 civilians and wounded more than
330 in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh. A 29th victim died of
his wounds and was buried Monday.

	   The dissidents on Aug. 19 declared a ``suspension'' of what it
called its ``military operations,'' a step short of Tuesday's
decision to call a formal cease-fire.
	   In its statement issued to the Irish state broadcasters RTE, the
dissidents _ calling themselves simply IRA or its traditional
Gaelic sister label, Oglaigh na hEireann or ``Soldiers of Ireland''
_ said: ``As a result of intense consultation that has taken place
over recent weeks, and in accordance with the constitution of
Oglaigh na hEireann, the volunteers of Oglaigh na hEireann have
determined a complete cessation of all military activity.''
	   This brings the group into line with the mainstream IRA and
several other paramilitary groups: the IRA's main anti-British
rival, the Irish National Liberation Army, which called its own
truce Aug. 22, and Northern Ireland's two major outlawed
pro-British gangs, the Ulster Defense Association and Ulster
Volunteer Force, which called a joint cease-fire in 1994.
	   In response to the Omagh atrocity the British and Irish
governments recalled their parliaments to pass emergency
anti-terrorist legislation that would give police greater power to
secure conviction of suspected Real IRA members. So far, however,
police in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic have yet to use
those extra powers to round up suspects on their list.

Caribbean territories tell British their banking incentives are
</HEADLINE>
fair &QL; 
 &UR; By RAYMOND HAINEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Representatives from British overseas territories
met with officials in London in an attempt to keep their islands
off a list of areas with ``harmful tax competition'' in the banking
industry.
	   Representatives from Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the British
Virgin Islands, Turks and Caicos, Anguilla and Montserrat met
Monday with officials from the British Foreign Office and Treasury
to argue their cases. The British territories of Gibraltar and the
Falklands also participated.
	   The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development
believes some territories' tax incentives could constitute unfair
trade practices under proposed financial regulations and has asked
the Foreign Office for information on British overseas territories.
	   The G-7 trade group has asked for a similar report on the
banking industry and tax incentives, said Donald Anderson, chairman
of the House of Commons' Select Committee on Foreign Affairs.
	   ``Since we are responsible for foreign representation, we could
find ourselves in great embarrassment internationally unless we
have a degree of oversight,'' Anderson said.
	   Participants in Monday's meeting told reporters they had agreed
not to disclose details of the discussion.
	   Foreign holding companies and offshore banks that accept
deposits from foreigners are big business in many Caribbean
islands. In the Cayman Islands alone, the financial sector
contributed dlrs 170 million in 1997, 16 percent of the country's
gross domestic product.

Dollar lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks rise in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen early
Tuesday in Tokyo as traders continued to watch the Russian
political situation. Japanese stock prices rose.
	   The dollar bought 131.34 yen in early trading, down 0.65 yen
from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late London level of
131.79 yen overnight. The New York markets were closed Monday for
Labor Day.
	   There was some dollar buying by Japanese investors at
mid-morning, while selling pressure also remained as overseas
investors sought to make up for losses on their Russian
investments, dealers said.
	   Russia's parliament on Monday rejected President Boris Yeltsin's
candidate for prime minister a second time, leaving the country in
political limbo as the economy crumbles.
	   The Kremlin said late Monday that there was no word on how soon
Yeltsin would offer a new nomination.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices started higher
apparently on continued hedge fund purchases and buying activity
related to Friday's settlement of September futures, traders said.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 312.49
points, or 2.11 percent, to 15,102.55 in the first one hour of
trading. On Monday, the average closed up 747.15 points, or 5.32
percent, bolstered by prospects that Japanese lawmakers were close
to an agreement on a banking system bailout.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 10.64 points, or 0.94 percent, to 1,143.29. The
TOPIX closed up 38.18 points, or 3.49 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond was unquoted in early trading. On Monday, the yield
finished at 1.040 percent and its price was at 112.83 yen.

Guatemala to exhume body of slain bishop for tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A Guatemalan judge decided Monday to
exhume the body of Roman Catholic Bishop Juan Gerardi Conedera in a
bid to obtain more evidence on his April bludgeoning death.
	   The exhumation may be key in determining whether Gerardi was
killed by a fellow priest _ as prosecutors charge _ or whether the
killing was the work of military men angered by Gerardi's human
rights work, as some activists believe.
	   Police in July arrested the Rev. Mario Orantes Najera in
connection with Gerardi's death. He lived in Gerardi's residence at
the time of the killing. Orantes Najera has said he is innocent.
	   Judge Isaias Figueroa Medina did not set a date for the
exhumation.
	   Gerardi was bludgeoned to death in his garage on April 26, two
days after he delivered a church human rights report blaming the
military and pro-government death squads for most of the deaths
during Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996.
	   Figueroa Medina said forensics experts representing prosecutors,
the court and the church's Human Rights Office will be present at
the exhumation and examination of the body. Gerardi's remains lie
in a crypt beneath Guatemala City's Metropolitan Cathedral.
	   The specialists are expected to look for evidence of dog-bite
marks which Spanish experts say they saw in photographs of
Gerardi's body. Orantes Najera reportedly owned a dog which
responded only to his orders.

Kim Jong Il names new defense minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Vice Marshal Kim Il Chol, North
Korea's top naval commander, has been appointed defense minister,
the country's media reported Tuesday.
	   In a two-sentence dispatch, the North's Korean Central News
Agency said leader Kim Jong Il named the naval officer as minister
of the People's Armed Forces, or defense minister.
	   Kim Jong Il's position as head of the National Defense
Commission makes him North Korea's head of state under a
constitutional amendment approved by the country's legislature on
Saturday.
	   The post of defense minister had been vacant since the death of
Choe Kwang in February 1997.
	   South Korean officials believe that Kim Il Chol is the first
naval officer to assume the defense minister's post in North Korea,
which has traditionally put emphasis on its ground forces.
	   His appointment spawned speculation among South Korean watchers
that the communist country may change its defense strategy to
strengthen its navy.
	   Born in the North's capital of Pyongyang in 1933, the new
defense minister graduated from a Soviet naval college in the
1960s.
	   He was named commander of North Korea's East Sea Fleet in 1970
and became the top navy commander in 1980.
	   In Saturday's government shakeup, Kim Il Chol was named one of
three vice chairmen of the National Defense Commission under Kim
Jong Il.
	   According to South Korean officials, the two Kims are unrelated.

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS and UPDATES with Houston game. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire tied Roger Maris' major league
record with his 61st homer of the season, leading the St. Louis
Cardinals over the Chicago Cubs 3-2 Monday.
	   McGwire, who has 19 games remaining to break the record,
connected in the first inning against Mike Morgan (0-1). McGwire,
2-for-4 with a single and the homer, is three homers ahead of
Chicago's Sammy Sosa, who went 1-for-5 with a single.
	   Darren Oliver (3-2) allowed one run and six hits in 6 1-3
innings, and Juan Acevedo got his sixth save. Chicago dropped into
a tie with the Mets in the NL wild-card race.
 &UR; Mets 8, Braves 7
	   In New York, Edgardo Alfonzo hit a two-run homer off John Rocker
(1-2) with two outs in the eighth as New York rallied from a 7-6
deficit.
	   Greg McMichael (3-4), the Mets' fourth reliever, pitched the
eighth and John Franco worked the ninth for his 33rd save.
	   Luis Lopez matched a career-high with four RBIs and Tony
Phillips homered for the Mets. A violent thunderstorm caused a
1-hour, 48-minute rain delay in the fourth inning.
 &UR; Rockies 15, Marlins 10
	   In Denver, Larry Walker hit two solo homers, going 3-for-4 and
increased his NL-leading batting average to .354. Vinny Castilla
went 4-for-5 with his 42nd homer and three RBIs.
	   Colorado tied a season-high with 15 runs and matched a franchise
record with 21 hits. Castilla's sixth-inning homer off Eric Ludwick
(1-4) came after a walk to Walker and put the Rockies ahead 11-10.
	   Curtis Leskanic (6-3) won despite allowing two runs in two
innings.
 &UR; Brewers 6, Pirates 3
	   In Pittsburgh, Marc Newfield's two-run pinch-homer broke a
seventh-inning tie, and Pittsburgh lost for the ninth time in 10
games. Dave Nilsson also hit a two-run homer off Elmer Dessens
(2-3), Nilsson's first since July 13.
	   Brewers rookie Rafael Roque (4-1) allowed all three runs but
just two hits in six innings, and Bob Wickman got his 22nd save.
 &UR; Astros 1, Reds 0
	   In Houston, Randy Johnson pitched a six-hitter for his fourth
straight shutout in the Astrodome since Houston acquired him.
	   Johnson (7-1) struck out 14 and walked one _ intentionally. It
was his 17th double-digit strikeout game this season, the 100th of
his career.
	   Since Houston got him from Seattle on July 31, Johnson has 85
strikeouts in eight starts, reaching double digits four times. His
ERA is 1.00.
	   Derek Bell homered off Steve Parris (4-3) as Houston beat the
Reds for the sixth straight time.

Mexico extends anti-dumping tariffs against U.S. corn syrup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's Commerce Ministry will extend
anti-dumping tariffs on imports of U.S. high fructose corn syrup to
include syrup above grade 55.
	   In January, the ministry placed tariffs on imports of grade 42
and grade 55 of high fructose syrup, also known as HFCS, following
an investigation in which it determined that imports of the
sweetener were damaging Mexico's domestic sugar industry. The
higher the grade the sweeter the syrup.
	   In a press release Monday, the secretariat said the new tariffs
were dlrs 90.26 per metric ton for HFCS imports from A.E. Staley
Manufacturing Company and dlrs 55.37 per metric ton on imports from
Archer Daniels Midland Company.
	   The ministry said it was also investigating charges that HFCS
exporters were using grade 90 HFCS to circumvent the tariff on
grade 55.
	   Mexico's National Sugar and Alcohol Industries Chamber brought
charges against imports of HFCS in February 1997, arguing that its
use among soft-drink makers was displacing Mexican sugar.

Canadian consultant Michael Mackey to audit Mexico's Bank Savings
Protection Fund, which assumed dlrs 55 billion of bad debt during
the 1995 banking crisis.
	   Congress has demanded an audit of Fobaproa, as the fund is
known, amid accusations that the bank bailout was marred by
mismanagement and corruption. President Ernesto Zedillo wants to
consolidate Fobaproa liabilities into public debt.
	   Mackey said he hoped to finish the audit ``as soon as possible''
but declined to give a date. Most congressmen don't expect the
audit to be completed before early 1999.
	   The audit team will look at several hundred of the largest
non-performing loans made by private banks but assumed by the
federal government after the 1994 peso devaluation.
	   Critics have charged that many of the loans were made improperly
and that some businessmen over-valued collateral guarantees on the
credits.

America's friends in Afghanistan have become its enemies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Dozens of Pakistani policemen line up
behind razor-sharp barbed wire and rows of concrete blocks
protecting the U.S. Consulate in this Pakistani outpost on the road
to Afghanistan.
	   Horns scream angrily as traffic police, their hands slapping the
fume-choked air, direct cars and buses in an attempt to keep any
possible anti-American terrorists away from the area.
	   It wasn't always like this.
	   There was a time in the 1980s when the U.S. Consulate was a
popular meeting place for Pakistanis and Afghans. Leaders of the
Islamic resistance, waging a bitter battle to oust the invading
Soviet Army, made regular visits to the U.S. Consulate.
	   America was a friend to the Afghan freedom fighters. The Cold
War was at its peak, and Pakistan was the front-line state against
the spread of communism and the staging arena for the Muslim
insurgency.
	   Afghan resistance leaders visited Ronald Reagan at the White
House, and the former U.S. president embraced them as freedom
fighters.
	   That was then.
	   Now, those same Afghan leaders are harboring the man Washington
has declared enemy No. 1, Osama bin Laden, the Saudi billionaire
believed to be behind last month's bombings of U.S. embassies in
East Africa.
	   It was bin Laden's training camps that U.S. Tomahawk missiles
tried to destroy on Aug. 20. The camps were located near Khost in
eastern Afghanistan, the headquarters of Jalaluddin Haqqani, once a
key resistance leader and a close friend of Washington's.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton now calls the camps near Khost one
of the most active training grounds in the world, where Arab,
Pakistani and Afghan Islamic militants learn the art of terror.
	   Western analysts still are trying to figure out why the United
States went from friend to foe.
	   Some blame the Central Intelligence Agency, saying it let
Pakistan's dictator Zia-ul Haq and his intelligence agents run the
Afghan war.
	   He petitioned Muslims everywhere to come to Afghanistan to
participate in a holy war against the former Soviet Union.
	   Abdul Haq, a former Afghan rebel commander and a big recipient
of U.S. aid, knew the Arab militants were becoming powerful during
the 1980s. They would come to Afghanistan with suitcases packed
with millions of dollars.
	   ``We didn't have any banks. There was no other way to get money
inside,'' Haq said in an interview with The Associated Press from
his home in the Pakistani frontier city of Peshawar.
	   ``From day one, the Americans' biggest mistake was that they
didn't really care about Afghans,'' he said. ``American support was
never based on a strategy to make a political system for Afghans to
live in peace.''
	   The Afghan resistance parties, Haq said, each acted as
mini-governments with their own prime ministers, ministers and
armies. It was a formula for disaster should peace come to
Afghanistan.
	   ``But the Americans didn't care ... as long as they were
bleeding the Russians it was okay,'' he said.
	   Thousands of Arab militants arrived in Pakistan, and an assembly
line was created, Haq said. The United States, or more particularly
the CIA, got supplies to Pakistan, then the Pakistani army and
intelligence agency moved the weapons and ammunition to Afghanistan
and the mujahedeen or holy warriors moved it inside Afghanistan.
	   Who got the weapons, money and ammunition was largely decided by
the Arabs, who ran the logistics inside Afghanistan, he said. They
got the job because they were spending so much money.
	   ``For every one dollar the Americans gave, the Saudis gave two
dollars,'' he said. ``The Arabs were responsible for the
logistics.''
	   For the Saudi royal family, he said, Afghanistan was an ideal
place to send Islamic dissidents because it kept them from making
trouble back home.
	   But Haq said the Arab fighters were building their own cadre of
supporters, choosing Afghan fighters who envisioned spreading Islam
worldwide. Still today, he said ``they need a place where they can
train, store equipment, hide their people ... their numbers are
growing. There are more and more people unhappy in Islamic
countries,'' he said.

Sampras, rain dominate on Labor Day at U.S. Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sanchez Vicario, Davenport victories; will be
UPDATED after Agassi-Kucera match. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROB GLOSTER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Pete Sampras strolled off the court after
overpowering yet another young challenger. Venus Williams strutted
in victory, pumping up the crowd with an on-court dance that looked
like an football player's end zone celebration.
	   On a Monday when thunderstorms turned the U.S. Open into
Wimbledon West, Sampras and Williams reached the quarterfinals with
convincing wins over dangerous opponents.
	   Sampras had 18 aces and never lost his serve in a 6-4, 6-3, 6-2
win that included a 2 1/4-hour rain break, turning his power lunch
with Marat Safin into a late-afternoon snack for the world's top
player.
	   ``I was cracking it pretty hard throughout the match,'' Sampras
said. ``I got the serve going, which has been a little bit up and
down throughout this past week. Today it seemed like it clicked.''
	   The top-seeded Sampras, a four-time U.S. Open champion, next
will face the winner of a match between No. 8 Andre Agassi and No.
9 Karol Kucera.
	   Williams won the final six points of the tiebreaker in her 6-1,
7-6 (7-4) win over No. 12 Mary Pierce, celebrating her win by
shimmying to the net.
	   ``I really shouldn't have done the dance, I should have waited
until later,'' she said. ``I didn't plan to do the dance. I planned
to win the second set really easy.''
	   Williams' quarterfinal opponent will be No. 4 Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario, who won 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 over No. 15 Anna Kournikova.
	   Also advancing to the quarterfinals was No. 2 Lindsay Davenport,
who won 6-1, 6-4 over No. 10 Nathalie Tauziat and next will play
Amanda Coetzer.
	   Sampras lost only 20 points on his serve in the match and closed
out his 600th career win with three consecutive aces _ including
one at 135 mph. He won 41 of 48 points on his first serve in the
match.
	   Safin, 18, who wowed crowds at this year's French Open with a
string of upsets en route to the fourth round in his Grand Slam
debut, showed off plenty of power, including 10 aces. But he was no
match for the steady Sampras.
	   ``He's very talented, but also very young. The first set I
couldn't believe the pace of his serve, I really had a hard time
reading it. The talent is there, maybe he just needs to tone it
down a little bit,'' Sampras said. ``He's 18 years old and he's got
plenty of years to learn from mistakes. My game at 18 was pretty
bad.''
	   Sampras was 19 when he won the U.S. Open for the first time.
	   Williams took advantage of 19 unforced errors and two double
faults to win the first set in 24 minutes against Pierce, who twice
had her wrist treated by a trainer. Pierce was down a break in the
second set when rain interrupted play.
	   Pierce was a different player after the break, and so was
Williams _ who had 31 unforced errors in the second set, as
compared to just two in the first set. The second set lasted 1
hour, 11 minutes.
	   The second set was tied 5-5 when Williams and Pierce played the
game of the match. It lasted 13 minutes, 57 seconds and ended when
Williams converted her seventh break point to take a 6-5 lead.
	   Pierce broke right back and took a 4-1 lead in the tiebreaker,
but didn't get another point in the match.
	   Already overshadowed by Mark McGwire's chase for the home-run
record, the tournament almost had its Labor Day showcase washed
away as thunderstorms and strong winds gave the courts all the
charm of a car wash.
	   With tornadoes touching down nearby, players were forced off the
courts as the sky turned pitch black in mid-afternoon. By the time
they returned, the temperature had dropped 22 degrees _ from 89 to
67.
	   ``It was a scary sight, it was like green out there,'' Sampras
said of the stormy sky. ``Maybe it was going to rain money.''
	   The rain returned at night, delaying some matches by an
additional half hour.
	   The earlier batch of bad weather came just after the day's
biggest sports moment, McGwire's 61st homer in St. Louis. The feat
was not announced to the tennis crowd, although a big roar could be
heard from Shea Stadium across the subway tracks, where the Mets
were playing Atlanta.
	   The only singles match completed before the rain was a marathon
fourth-round women's contest in which No. 13 Coetzer slammed a
backhand passing shot down the line on match point to win 6-4, 4-6,
6-2 over No. 7 Conchita Martinez.
	   With Coetzer and Martinez engaging in long baseline rallies and
occasionally hitting moonballs, the match lasted 2 hours, 39
minutes. One game had 28 points, including 11 deuces, and consumed
more than 20 minutes. The second set alone, at 1:16, was only one
minute shorter than the entire Sampras-Safin match.

 &UR; IRA dissidents declare `complete cease-fire'
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series; ADDS by-line; no UPPICK
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ The Irish Republican Army dissidents
responsible for Northern Ireland's worst-ever terrorist atrocity
called a ``complete'' cease-fire Tuesday but didn't apologize for
their actions.
	   The splinter group, dubbed the Real IRA by journalists and
unwilling to accept the IRA's July 1997 cease-fire, committed the
Aug. 15 car bombing that killed 28 civilians and wounded more than
330 in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh. A 29th victim died of
his wounds and was buried Monday.
	   On Aug. 19, the group declared a ``suspension'' of what it
called its ``military operations,'' in a step short of Tuesday's
formal cease-fire.
	   In its statement issued to the Irish state broadcasters RTE, the
dissidents _ calling themselves simply IRA _ or its traditional
Gaelic sister label, Oglaigh na hEireann or ``Soldiers of Ireland''
_ said: ``As a result of intense consultation that has taken place
over recent weeks, and in accordance with the constitution of
Oglaigh na hEireann, the volunteers of Oglaigh na hEireann have
determined a complete cessation of all military activity.''
	   This brings the group into line with the mainstream IRA and
several other paramilitary groups: the IRA's main anti-British
rival, the Irish National Liberation Army, which called its own
truce Aug. 22, and Northern Ireland's two major outlawed
pro-British gangs, the Ulster Defense Association and Ulster
Volunteer Force, which called a joint cease-fire in 1994.
	   In response to the Omagh atrocity the British and Irish
governments recalled their parliaments to pass emergency
anti-terrorist legislation that would give police greater power to
secure conviction of suspected Real IRA members. So far, however,
police in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic have yet to use
those extra powers to round up suspects on their list.
	   British and Irish security forces have estimated that the Real
IRA has recruited 50 to 100 members since its key figure, the IRA's
former ``quartermaster general'' responsible for the outlawed
group's network of arms dumps, resigned last October.
	   That reputed commander lives in Dundalk, an Irish Republic
border town midway between Dublin and Belfast, and most of his
supporters likewise are believed to live south of the border that
has divided Ireland since 1920.
	   Real IRA members and supporters claimed last week that senior
IRA figures had visited their homes and threatened that ``direct
action'' would be taken against them if they committed any more car
bombings in Northern Ireland.
	   The Omagh attack was at least the seventh car bomb planted in a
Northern Ireland town by the dissidents. The others had either been
defused or exploded after police evacuated the immediate area,
causing severe commercial damage and many injuries but no deaths.
	   The Real IRA made three telephoned warnings Aug. 15 about its
Omagh car bomb, but authorities said the calls were deliberately
misleading to encourage police to evacuate civilians away from the
town's courthouse and towards crowded Market Street, where the
500-pound (225 kg) bomb actually exploded amid workers, shoppers
and tourists.
	   In an Aug. 18 statement preceding its ``suspension'' statement,
the Real IRA declared ``regret'' over the atrocity but claimed at
length that it had never specified the courthouse as a target.
	   Among those slain were 16 Catholics, 11 Protestants and two
Spanish tourists, the first foreigners killed in 30 years of
violence in Northern Ireland. Also among the dead were two infant
girls and a mother 8 1/2 months pregnant with twins, who weren't
included in official casualty lists.
	   The Real IRA's announcement came hours after Northern Ireland's
major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, ended its ban on
direct communication with the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party, another
symbolic step down the road to reconciliation.
	   At a two-hour meeting at Stormont Parlimentary Building in
Belfast, the venue for a new cross-community government outlined in
April's peace accord, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble
discussed the establishment of a multi-party administration with
seven other party leaders, including Sinn Fein chief Gerry Adams.
	   Trimble had sat through eight months of negotiations opposite
Adams without saying a direct word to him, citing the IRA's refusal
to start disarming as proof it had really renounced violence. The
April agreement commits Sinn Fein to secure the IRA's disarmament
by mid-2000.
	   A majority of Protestant and Catholic politicians in Belfast's
new legislative Assembly in July elected Trimble to lead the new
administration.

Sluman wins Greater Milwaukee Open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT IMRIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Jeff Sluman's first victory in 19 months gave
his best friend the experience of a lifetime.
	   Sluman won the Greater Milwaukee Open on Sunday with Rick
Bruder, a non-golfer serving as a caddie for the first time in his
life.
	   ``He was really, really nervous out there,'' Sluman said. ``He
probably kept me relaxed. I was kind of laughing inside at how
nervous he was.
	   Bruder saw his buddy get his third career PGA Tour victory.
	   ``He is on cloud nine. It has been a wonderful week,'' Sluman
said.
	   Sluman bogeyed No. 18 for a 3-under-par 68 and a 19-under 265
total, beating Steve Stricker by one stroke.
	   ``The golf course wasn't really giving up a lot. When I got to
20 under, I figured I was in pretty good shape unless I screwed up
bad,'' Sluman said. ``Eighteen certainly wasn't an artistic
success, but I ended up with a check and that is all that really
matters.''
	   Sluman, 40, won the 1988 PGA Championship and 1997 Tucson
Classic.
	   Stricker, from nearby Madison, made it interesting.
	   He began the final round one stroke behind co-leaders Sluman and
Chris Perry and climbed back into contention with birdies on the
final four holes, duplicating what he did Saturday.
	   ``I wanted to win so badly,'' said Stricker, who also shot a 68.
	   Sluman eagled No. 6. He holed a 20-foot (6-meter) chip from the
heavy rough, punching his left hand in encouragement as the ball
bent slightly left and rolled into the center of the cup.
	   He led the rest of the way.
	   ``Chipping in from there really adds a lot of momentum to your
round,'' he said. ``From there it just started rolling and I felt
pretty comfortable.''
	   On No. 5, a par 3, Sluman chipped in from 45 feet (14 meters).
	   Stricker, who became a father for the first time last Monday,
had said that winning what amounts to his backyard tournament would
be ``more special'' to him than any other. His wife, Nicki, was his
caddie until becoming pregnant.
	   ``It has just been a great week. On Monday, the birth of our
child and to hang in there the way I did over the last two days and
play the way I did, it feels good,'' he said.
	   Although trailing by three strokes, Stricker got a standing
ovation from the crowd as he walked up the 18th fairway.
	   ``I got goose bumps and my hair was standing on end on my arms.
... It just gives you chills,'' Stricker said. ``They showed me a
lot of support. It is one of the best walks I have ever had.''
	   Perry closed with a 71 to tie for third at 268 with Mark
Calcavecchia and Nolan Henke, who both shot 69s.
	   Perry, a Minnesota product whose father Jim pitched for the
Twins, Cleveland, Detroit and Oakland, is winless since joining the
tour in 1984.
	   Playing with Sluman, Perry was one stroke behind before bogeying
Nos. 8 and 9. He left birdie putts short on two of the last three
holes.

Ammaccapane family all smiles at LPGA Safeway
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LANDON HALL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTLAND, Oregon (AP) _ Dina Ammaccapane popped her head into
the tiny room where her big sister, Danielle, was being
interviewed.
	   ``Are you buying dinner tonight?'' Dina asked.
	   Danielle Ammaccapane also was buying drinks all around _ most of
them back home in Phoenix _ after winning the Safeway LPGA Golf
Championship.
	   She shot an even-par 72 on Sunday to hold off Emilee Klein by
one stroke. Dina, 30, shot a 66 to finish at 207, three strokes
behind her sister, to take third, one spot higher than her previous
career best.
	   Danielle Ammaccapane, 32, owns a restaurant and sports bar in
Phoenix with her father, Ralph. After walking off the 18th green,
she called him at Ammaccapane's and got a welcome worthy of a
``Cheers'' episode.
	   ``He said, `Danielle's on the phone!' and the bar just went
nuts,'' she said. ``It was the loudest sound you ever heard.''
	   It was the best combined finish for the Ammaccapane sisters.
	   ``He was in tears,'' Danielle said of her father. ``He was very
happy for my sister and I.''
	   Danielle Ammaccapane finished with a 12-under 204 total for her
seventh tour victory. She won the Mercury Titleholders Championship
in May.
	   Klein, who began the round three shots behind Danielle
Ammaccapane, tied her with a birdie 4 on the 501-yard (460-meter)
10th hole that left both players 11 under. Ammaccapane then birdied
Nos. 12 and 13 on the 6,307-yard (5,765-meter) Columbia-Edgewater
Country Club course to take the lead for good.
	   She said she never looks at the computerized leaderboards on the
course to see where Dina was, but her caddie kept her updated.
	   Klein, who shot a final-round 70, failed in her bid to win her
first title since the 1996 British Women's Open.
	   ``I needed some gifts from her, but she wasn't giving anything
away today,'' Klein said. ``It wasn't Christmas. It wasn't even my
birthday.''

Government cuts assessment of economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Japanese government downgraded its assessment
of the country's economy Tuesday and warned that recent turmoil in
world markets could prolong an already stubborn slump.
	   In its monthly report on the economy for September, the Economic
Planning Agency said the situation in Japan was ``very severe'' and
could get worse.
	   That's stronger language than the EPA has used in the past.
After months of claiming the economy was in ``gradual recovery,''
the agency has only recently admitted what indicators had already
shown: Japan's economy is contracting.
	   Nor are short-term prospects very bright. Recent instability in
world markets in Asia and elsewhere ``will cause sentiment to
deteriorate further,'' said Takashi Omori, an EPA official.
	   Still, Omori said he expects government stimulus measures,
including a cut in income taxes, to breath some life into domestic
consumption, which has been in marked decline.
	   ``The recent tax cuts will impact income, so there is a
possibility that it will boost private consumption'' in September
and October, Omori said.
	   The report also cited a deterioration in other key areas of the
economy, especially housing starts and unemployment.

Ruling party wants to stop cash flow to North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Alarmed by North Korea's missile launch last week,
the ruling party has decided to study how cash flows from Japan to
the isolationist communist nation can be stopped, a party official
said Tuesday.
	   Although Tokyo has no diplomatic ties with North Korea, a
considerable amount of money is believed to be sent there from
Japan, mostly from Koreans living in Japan. About 640,000 Koreans
live in Japan, many born in Japan. Although there is no official
tally, about 180,000 of them are estimated to be loyal to the
North.
	   In a meeting Monday, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
discussed the North Korean missile threat and decided to start
studying legal changes to halt cash transfers from Japan to North
Korea, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The missile test last Monday has prompted some Japanese
politicians to push for Japan's own missile monitoring and defense
system. The Defense Agency says that the missile sailed over Japan
and into the Pacific, proving that it is capable of striking any
part of Japan.
	   Japan has stopped food aid, frozen its pledge to contribute dlrs
1 billion to an international nuclear power plant project in North
Korea and halted all charter flights between the two nations in
retaliation for the missile firing.
	   U.S. and Japanese officials have called the firing a ballistic
missile test, but the North claims it was a scientific satellite.
	   Quoting unidentified diplomatic sources, the ITAR-Tass news
agency of Russia reported Monday that North Korea will test another
missile Wednesday.

IRA dissidents declare `complete' cease-fire
</HEADLINE>

reaction, RAISES political context graf 9; edits pvs &QL;

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Irish Republican Army dissidents
responsible for Northern Ireland's worst-ever terrorist atrocity
called a ``complete'' cease-fire Tuesday but didn't apologize for
their actions.
	   The splinter group, dubbed the Real IRA by journalists and
unwilling to accept the IRA's July 1997 cease-fire, committed the
Aug. 15 car bombing that killed 28 civilians and wounded more than
330 in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh. A 29th victim died of
his wounds and was buried Monday.
	   On Aug. 19, the group declared a ``suspension'' of what it
called its ``military operations,'' in a step short of Tuesday's
formal cease-fire.
	   In Tuesday's statement issued to state broadcasters RTE, the
dissidents _ calling themselves by the IRA's traditional Gaelic
sister label, Oglaigh na hEireann, or ``Soldiers of Ireland,''
said: ``As a result of intense consultation that has taken place
over recent weeks ... the volunteers of Oglaigh na hEireann have
determined a complete cessation of all military activity.''
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern gave a qualified welcome to
the statement.
	   ``On the basis that this statement is now put fully into effect
and is final, it would represent both an important and a positive
development,'' Ahern said. ``It will not, unfortunately, bring the
dead of Omagh back to life, heal the injured or comfort their
families.''
	   And the British government's Northern Ireland Office issued its
own statement emphasizing that ``the Real IRA needs not just to
talk but to convince the Irish people that their violence is at an
end for good.''
	   The Real IRA's announcement came hours after Northern Ireland's
major British Protestant party, the Ulster Unionist party, ended
its ban on direct communication with the IRA-allied Sinn Fein
party, another symbolic step down the road to reconciliation.
	   The statement brought the Real IRA into line with the mainstream
IRA and several other paramilitary groups: the IRA's main
anti-British rival, the Irish National Liberation Army, which
called its own truce Aug. 22, and Northern Ireland's two major
outlawed pro-British gangs _ the Ulster Defense Association and
Ulster Volunteer Force _ which called a joint cease-fire in 1994.
	   In response to the Omagh atrocity, the British and Irish
governments passed emergency anti-terrorist legislation that gave
police greater power to seek conviction of alleged Real IRA
members. So far, however, police have yet to round up suspects on
their list.
	   Ahern said the cease-fire declaration would ``not affect the
unrelenting determination of the two governments to pursue the
perpetrators of this and other crimes, and bring them to justice.''
	   British and Irish security forces have estimated that the Real
IRA has recruited 50 to 100 members since its reputed commander,
the IRA's former ``quartermaster general'' responsible for the
outlawed group's network of arms dumps, resigned last October.
	   That figure lives in Dundalk, an Irish Republic border town
midway between Dublin and Belfast. Most of his supporters likewise
are believed to live south of the border that has divided Ireland
since 1920.
	   Real IRA members and supporters claimed last week that senior
IRA figures had visited their homes and threatened that ``direct
action'' would be taken against them if they committed any more car
bombings in Northern Ireland.
	   The Omagh attack was at least the seventh car bomb planted in a
Northern Ireland town by the dissidents. The others had either been
defused or exploded after police evacuated the immediate area,
causing severe commercial damage and many injuries but no deaths.
	   The Real IRA made three telephoned warnings Aug. 15 about its
Omagh car bomb, but authorities said the calls were deliberately
misleading to encourage police to evacuate civilians away from the
town's courthouse and toward crowded Market Street, where the
500-pound (225 kg) bomb exploded amid workers, shoppers and
tourists.
	   In an Aug. 18 statement preceding its ``suspension''
announcement, the Real IRA declared ``regret'' over the atrocity
but claimed at length that it had never specified the courthouse as
the target.
	   Among those slain were 16 Catholics, 11 Protestants and two
Spanish tourists, the first foreigners killed in 30 years of
violence in Northern Ireland. Also among the dead were two infant
girls and a mother 8 1/2 months pregnant with twins, who weren't
included on official casualty lists.

Agassi clowns through Open comeback

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mimicry and moonballs helped give Andre Agassi a
chance to save a place in the U.S. Open quarterfinals.
	   Down two sets and showing few signs of life Monday night, Agassi
suddenly turned things around and pushed the match against Karol
Kucera to a fourth set before rain ended play.
	   Kucera led 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 0-3, when the last of a series
of Labor Day showers pushed the end of the match to Tuesday. The
winner plays top ranked Pete Sampras in the quarters.
	   Agassi is 4-1 in five-setters at the U.S. Open, including a 6-2,
6-2, 6-7 (6-8), 3-6, 6-1 victory over Guillame Raoux in the second
round.
	   Agassi became upset by Kucera's repeated tossing of the ball on
serves in the third set.
	   ``Can he do that on every point?'' Agassi asked umpire Norm
Chryst. Chryst said Kucera was within the rules.
	   On his next service game, Agassi started to mimic Kucera, making
toss after toss. Chryst watched closely, signs of a grin appearing
on his face, but let the tennis showman do his thing as Agassi tied
the third set 4-4.
	   Agassi then started hitting moonballs _ long, floating lobs with
little speed _ in the next game, and while Kucera, the No. 9 seed
from Slovakia, held serve, Agassi had altered the tempo and gotten
to his opponent, Kucera pointed his finger at Agassi at one point
and tossed a ball in his direction on the changeover.
	   Agassi was pumped up. With his wife, actress Brooke Shields,
cheering wildly, he held for 5-5, pumping his fist at Kucera and
yelling ``Come on!''
	   The eighth-seeded American then ran off eight straight points to
win the 12th game and take a 4-0 lead in the tiebreaker before
converting his first set point of the rainy evening on a blistering
forehand into the corner.
	   The momentum held through the opening three games of the fourth
set, before a light mist turned into steady rain.

Government says Sam Rainsy won't be arrested as Hun Sen backs off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The government backed down Tuesday
from threats to arrest opposition leader Sam Rainsy as daily
protests against strongman Hun Sen widened following a bloody
crackdown that left one man dead.
	   Prum Sokha, a senior Interior Ministry official, told reporters
after urgent talks between government and opposition
representatives that Sam Rainsy would be allowed to leave the local
U.N. offices, where he had sought refuge against arrest Monday, and
go home.
	   However, Sam Rainsy had earlier tried to leave the luxury
Cambodiana hotel, where the offices are located, and was nearly
arrested by a waiting horde of policeman, said his spokesman, Rich
Garrella.
	   Lakhan Mehrotra, the U.N.'s special representative, quickly
pulled the politician back inside, Garrella said.
	   Hun Sen had labeled Sam Rainsy, one of the main organizers of
the protests against Hun Sen's victory in elections July 26, a
``terrorist'' Monday and blamed him for a grenade attack against
his home.
	   Hun Sen said Sam Rainsy would be arrested and set a deadline of
midnight Monday for the thousands of protesters to clear out from a
park they have occupied opposite the National Assembly for 16 days.
	   In the end, Hun Sen backed off, but not before soldiers fired
hundreds of rounds in the air Monday to disperse a crowd gathered
to support Sam Rainsy outside the hotel. One man was killed and
several injured.
	   No one was hurt in Monday's grenade attack. Sam Rainsy's party
denied involvement and said Hun Sen was using it as a pretext to
crush the unrest against his continued rule. Hun Sen denied staging
it himself.
	   The protesters celebrated their victory Tuesday in the test of
wills as their protest entered its 16th day.
	   Buddhist monks chanted and motorcycle taxi drivers beeped their
horns as their tent city, dubbed Democracy Square, awoke to a new
day.
	   ``They set a deadline for midnight and nothing happened,'' said
demonstrator Dara Choeun, 28, a student. ``We're going to stay
until these problems are solved. We're sick of this brutal
government.''
	   The shooting marked the worst violence in the capital since Hun
Sen deposed Prince Norodom Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a coup
last year. If it grows worse, he could lose the legitimacy he has
worked hard to regain through holding elections two months ago.
	   Hun Sen won a slight majority of the 122 National Assembly
seats. But Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, the two opposition leaders,
accuse him of massive fraud and have threatened to withhold the
vital two-thirds majority support he needs to form a new
government.
	   Hun Sen eased tactics Tuesday. Security was remarkably light as
protests resumed at Democracy Square, the hotel and government
ministries.
	   Hundreds of monks, upset by the beating Monday of one of their
brethren, were taking part, in one case leading a march.
	   The protesters have hung banners around their encampment reading
``Down with Hun Sen'' and ``Only America can ease Cambodia's
pain.''
	   Before dawn, smoke hung over the Cambodiana from a bonfire lit
by demonstrators burning shoes lost by people fleeing from the
gunfire.
	   Hun Sen's patience with the protests appears to be thinning as
the first meeting of the new National Assembly looms Sept. 24. If
he cannot reach an agreement with the opposition by then, Cambodia
could soon have no legal government.

Dollar lower in Tokyo, Japanese stocks rise in midday trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday trading, trader comment

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar slipped against the yen Tuesday
morning in Tokyo as traders continued to watch the Russian
political situation. Japanese stock prices rose.
	   The dollar bought 131.68 yen in late morning trading, down 0.31
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also below its late London level
of 131.79 yen overnight. The New York markets were closed Monday
for Labor Day.
	   There was some dollar buying by Japanese investors at
mid-morning, but selling pressure remained strong as overseas
investors sought to make up for losses on their Russian
investments, dealers said.
	   Russia's parliament on Monday rejected President Boris Yeltsin's
candidate for prime minister a second time, leaving the country in
political limbo as the economy crumbles.
	   The Kremlin said late Monday that there was no word on how soon
Yeltsin would offer a new nomination.
	   A sharp rise in Tokyo stocks also contributed to the yen's
strengthening against the dollar.
	   ``U.S. hedge funds and other overseas players sold dollars for
profit-taking and to procure the yen to invest in Japanese
stocks,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant foreign exchange manager at
the Tokyo office of ABN AMRO Bank.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices continued to surge as
hedge funds closed positions in Japan to make up for losses in
other markets such as Russia and the United States. Investors were
also covering short positions ahead of Friday's settlement of
September futures, traders said.
	   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 342.66
points, or 2.32 percent, to 15,132.72 at the end of the morning
session. On Monday, the average closed up 747.15 points, or 5.32
percent, bolstered by prospects that Japanese lawmakers were close
to an agreement on a banking system bailout.
	   However, traders said concerns about Japan's sputtering economy
and turmoil in world financial markets could make the Tokyo stock
market's rally short-lived.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 11.62 points, or 1.03 percent, to 1,144.27. The
TOPIX closed up 38.18 points, or 3.49 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.030 percent from 1.040 percent Monday,
driving its price up to 112.90 from 112.83 yen.

Students plan second protest day after clash with police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Student protesters planned to stage a
second day of protest against Indonesia's government Tuesday after
police and troops used batons, shields and tear gas to push
hundreds from the grounds of Parliament.
	   The official Antara news agency reported that two students were
hospitalized with bayonet wounds to their abdomens and others were
treated for tear gas inhalation.
	   A police spokesman said five officers were injured by rocks and
bottles thrown by demonstrators, who had earlier pushed down the
gates of the legislature.
	   The protest, which began Monday, was the biggest of its kind
since a marathon student sit-in at the Parliament helped force
President Habibie's autocratic predecessor, ex-President Suharto,
step down four months ago.
	   Chanting anti-government slogans, the students gathered outside
the green-domed building to demand that Habibie quit because of his
handling of Indonesia's economic crisis and failure to lower
soaring food prices.
	   They also urged that Suharto be put on trial for alleged
misdeeds, including corruption and repression, during his 32 years
at the helm of the nation of 202 million people.
	   Officers corralled the protesters in a parking lot on the
grounds. Many protesters later left peacefully.
	   However, about 300 refused repeated requests to disperse. A
standoff dragged on until about 1.30 a.m. Tuesday, when security
personnel forcibly evicted the protesters.
	   Police said they made no arrests.
	   Later Tuesday morning, rush hour traffic was choked after police
and troops blocked off a road outside the Parliament.
	   Witnesses said students were gathering at a nearby campus and
planned to march to the legislature.

Internet, computers aid global spread of pedophilia, says the Yard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ Home computers and the Internet
have turned an illegal trade in child pornography into a
sophisticated global cottage industry, the head of New Scotland
Yard's anti-pedophilia unit said Tuesday.
	   Where once child sex abusers had to rely on contacts in
clandestine networks, now anyone with a computer and modem can
access child pornography anywhere in the world through the phone
system, Detective Chief Inspector Bob McLachlan said.
	   McLachlan told a conference of the International Society for the
Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect that live pictures of child
sex abuse are now available through the Internet.
	   ``The potential (use of cyberspace for such crime) is enormous.
It makes law enforcement a difficult task, but not an impossible
one,'' he said.
	   McLachlan said that trying to keep pace with criminals who are
increasingly smart technologically presents police with new and
difficult problems.
	   Internet trade is blurring the legal boundaries of pornography
by using computer graphics to enhance images, or
``pseudo-photography,'' McLachlan said.
	   For example, a posed photograph of a naked woman scanned into a
computer can be transformed into the image of a child, he said.
	   ``One of the difficulties with this is that the child was never
like this, so it wasn't an indecent photograph of a child.''
	   ``The danger we face is that, because here is no way of proving
or disproving that it's a pseudo-photograph, there is the potential
for the bad guys to say, `All these are pseudo-photographs,''' he
added.
	   Advances in computer technology and the close-knit nature of the
pedophile community make it all the more important for police
worldwide to share information, he said.
	   McLachlan's unit advised the British police group that last week
exposed a worldwide Internet-based pedophile ring with the arrest
of almost 100 people in 12 countries.

China reports progress treating leprosy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The number of new leprosy cases in China has
fallen from 35,000 in 1958 to 1,800 last year, according to reports
at an international leprosy congress being held in Beijing.
	   About 120,000 Chinese have been disabled by leprosy, a chronic,
infectious disease that has been treatable with drugs since the
early 1980s, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported on Tuesday.
	   China is trying to reduce the rate of the disease and has
established a national system to detect cases and gather data,
Xinhua quoted Yin Dakui, a vice minister of health, as saying.
	   The international leprosy congress under way in Beijing through
Saturday was organized by the International Leprosy Association and
co-sponsored by the World Health Organization and the International
Federation of Anti-Leprosy Associations.
	   Worldwide, the World Health Organization estimates the number of
people afflicted by the bacterial disease has fallen from 12
million to 1.2 million people in 60 nations.

Yangtze River reopened to navigation after floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Normal navigation has resumed on the Yangtze
River following 43 days of disruption by floods, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Some ships were allowed back on China's longest river on Sept. 2
as the water level dropped, and restrictions that remained in some
areas were lifted Tuesday night, Xinhua said. It said the unusually
heavy floods this summer disrupted navigation on the Yangtze for
the longest period on record.
	   Flooding on the Yangtze this summer was the worst since floods
killed 30,000 people in 1954. The government reports 3,004 people
have died this year in a rare occurrence of strong floods on many
rivers at the same time.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police have arrested seven people suspected of
trying to sell or buy pelts of the giant panda, a severely
endangered species, the official newspaper China Daily reported
Tuesday.
	   Authorities also confiscated a 1.39-meter (4 1/2-foot) long pelt
of an adult panda during the arrests, which occurred last Wednesday
in the northern city of Xi'an, the report said.
	   Poaching has hindered government efforts to protect the panda, a
species indigenous only to China. There are fewer than 1,000 giant
pandas alive today.

IRA dissidents declare `complete' cease-fire

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Irish Republican Army dissidents
responsible for Northern Ireland's worst-ever terrorist atrocity
called a ``complete'' cease-fire Tuesday but didn't apologize for
their actions.
	   The splinter group, dubbed the Real IRA by journalists and
unwilling to accept the IRA's July 1997 cease-fire, committed the
Aug. 15 car bombing that killed 28 civilians and wounded more than
330 in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh. A 29th victim died of
his wounds and was buried Monday.
	   On Aug. 19, the group declared a ``suspension'' of what it
called its ``military operations,'' in a step short of Tuesday's
formal cease-fire.
	   In Tuesday's statement issued to state broadcasters RTE, the
dissidents _ calling themselves by the IRA's traditional Gaelic
sister label, Oglaigh na hEireann, or ``Soldiers of Ireland,''
said: ``As a result of intense consultation that has taken place
over recent weeks ... the volunteers of Oglaigh na hEireann have
determined a complete cessation of all military activity.''
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern gave a qualified welcome to
the statement.
	   ``On the basis that this statement is now put fully into effect
and is final, it would represent both an important and a positive
development,'' Ahern said. ``It will not, unfortunately, bring the
dead of Omagh back to life, heal the injured or comfort their
families.''
	   Ireland's President Mary McAleese said Tuesday she was heartened
by the announcement.
	   ``I simply hope that those who were slain in Omagh will be the
last to be added to the grim roll call of victims of violence,''
McAleese told an ecumenical service at the National Irish Memorial
in Sydney, Australia. She is on an 11-day diplomatic visit to
Australia which ends Wednesday.
	   The British government's Northern Ireland Office issued its own
statement emphasizing that ``the Real IRA needs not just to talk
but to convince the Irish people that their violence is at an end
for good.''

Drug-tainted Australian cyclist sparks controversy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Allowing drug-tainted Australian
cyclist Neil Stephens to ride at the Commonwealth Games has created
problems for the sport, Australian Olympic official Phil Coles said
Tuesday.
	   Coles, also an Australian Olympic Committee board member and the
AOC's director of international relations, questioned the
Australian Commonwealth Games Association's decision to allow
Stephens to compete at the Kuala Lumpur Games.
	   Malaysian Sports Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said Monday that
Stephens should not compete at the Games, which officially kick off
Friday.
	   Stephens was part of the Festina team expelled from the recent
Tour de France for using a performance enhancing substance.
	   The drug scandal has placed Malaysia and Australia at
loggerheads, once again. Relations have been poor since 1993, when
former Prime Minister Paul Keating set off a major political row by
criticizing his counterpart Mahathir Mohamad for boycotting the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
	   Things heated up again last month when Australian games chief
Perry Crosswhite warned his athletes that things would go wrong in
Kuala Lumpur because the games were being run by retired military
officers.
	   Festina team boss Bruno Roussel has confirmed the Australian
cycling team had an organized system of doping and five of the nine
team riders have admitted using drugs.
	   Stephens told French police he inadvertently took erythropoietin
(EPO), saying team officials did not tell him what the substance
was.
	   Coles told the Australian Associated Press that he found it odd
the ACGA and the Australian Cycling Federation allowed Stephens to
ride at the September 11-21 games.
	   The association and federation, both headed by Ray Godkin,
allowed Stephens to ride here as French authorities continue an
investigation into the drug scandal that rocked the Tour de France.
	   ``It was rather strange to me that cycling said he was OK to
compete,'' said Coles, who is also a member of the International
Olympic Committee.
	   ``I just don't know under what authority they were able to do
that. I don't know the real reason why they could do that but it's
up to them I guess.''
	   Asked if Australia would be embarrassed should Stephens win a
medal at the Games, Coles said if he was a fellow competitor he
would ``have some questions.''
	   Stephens was due to arrive in Kuala Lumpur Tuesday.

Long-time Chinese political prisoner needs medical parole: family
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A democracy activist imprisoned since 1990 is
seriously ill, but authorities are refusing to release him for
medical parole overseas, a rights group reported Tuesday.
	   The family of Yang Tongyan, who tried to form an underground
pro-democracy political party, is asking visiting U.N. human rights
commissioner Mary Robinson to examine their application for Yang's
parole, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement in China said.
	   Robinson, making the first visit to China by a U.N. human rights
chief, said on Monday that she was seeking ways to work with China
to promote human rights. She also is urging the government to sign
the international Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, one of
the two main U.N. treaties on human rights.
	   China has signed the other treaty, the international Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, but has not ratified it.
	   Yang, 37, is hospitalized at Longtan prison in Nanjing with
heart disease, a lung infection, arthritis and appendicitis, the
Hong Kong-based rights group said. The Beijing Teachers University
graduate tried to form a China Democracy Party and was sentenced to
10 years in prison for counter-revolution in 1990.
	   Yang's wife gave birth to a daughter just before he was
imprisoned and has suffered many hardships trying to provide for
her, the rights group said. It added that Yang has fasted
repeatedly to protest prison conditions.
	   Under legal reforms, China has eliminated counter-revolutionary
crimes and replaced them with crimes of jeopardizing state
security. Authorities have refused to conduct a general review of
all cases of those already imprisoned for counter-revolutionary
crimes.

Security forces protect Indonesia's Parliament after student clash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to LEAD with tight security around parliament; AMENDS
overline

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Security forces blocked roads around
the Parliament Tuesday after police and troops used batons, shields
and tear gas to push hundreds of student protesters from its
grounds in a pre-dawn clash.
	   The official Antara news agency reported that two students were
hospitalized with bayonet wounds to their abdomens and others were
treated for tear gas inhalation.
	   A police spokesman said five officers were injured by rocks and
bottles thrown by demonstrators who had earlier pushed down the
gates of the legislature.
	   The protest, which began Monday, was the biggest of its kind
since a marathon student sit-in at the Parliament helped force
Habibie's autocratic predecessor ex-President Suharto to step down
after a wave of riots four months ago.
	   Chanting anti-government slogans, the students gathered outside
the green-domed building Monday to demand that Habibie quit because
of his handling of Indonesia's economic crisis and failure to lower
soaring food prices.
	   They also urged that Suharto be put on trial for alleged
misdeeds, including corruption and repression, during his 32 years
at the helm of the nation of 202 million people.
	   Officers corralled the protesters into a parking lot on the
grounds. Many protesters later left peacefully.
	   However, about 300 refused repeated requests to disperse. A
standoff dragged on until about 1.30 a.m. Tuesday when security
personnel forcibly evicted the protesters.
	   Police said they made no arrests.
	   The Parliament precinct was quiet by mid-morning Tuesday as
legislators arrived to discuss the effects of Indonesia's financial
woes, including food shortages and price hikes.
	   Hundreds of security personnel placed piles of riot gear outside
the perimeter of the building as precaution. However, there was no
sign of trouble.
	   Lines of police and troops cut off several major roads leading
to the legislature amid reports that hundreds of students were
planning to march there from nearby campuses.
	   Rush hour traffic was choked by the heavy security presence.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Jose Canseco homered for the fourth consecutive
game and as the Toronto Blue Jays tied a club record with their
11th straight win, 15-1 over the Cleveland Indians on Monday.
	   Shannon Stewart and Carlos Delgado also hit three-run homers for
Toronto, which remained five games behind Boston in the wild-card
race. Toronto, which swept four games from the Red Sox at SkyDome,
hadn't won 11 straight since June 1987.
	   Kelvim Escobar (5-2) struck out 10 in eight innings, allowing
four hits. Chad Ogea (4-3) gave up six earned runs, six hits and
four walks in 2 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Red Sox 4, Yankees 3
	   In Boston, John Valentin hit a go-ahead homer in the eighth and
sent David Wells (17-3) to his first loss since June 15 as Boston
rallied from a 3-0, seventh-inning deficit.
	   The Yankees have lost three straight since winning their 100th
game Friday night against the White Sox. It's only their third
three-game losing streak this year but their second in a two-week
span.
	   New York lost for the 11th time in 19 games and its magic number
for clinching the AL East remained at three.
	   Greg Swindell (5-5) won and Tom Gordon pitched a perfect ninth
for his 39th save.
 &UR; Rangers 6, Twins 0
	   In Arlington, Texas, Rick Helling (18-7) pitched a three-hitter
and Juan Gonzalez highlighted a six-run seventh with his 41st homer
as second-place Texas closed within three games of Anaheim in the
AL West.
	   Gonzalez has 149 RBIs, the most in the AL since Ted Williams and
Vern Stephens of Boston each drove in 159 in 1949.
	   LaTroy Hawkins (7-14) allowed five runs and eight hits in 6 1-3
innings.
 &UR; White Sox 7, Tigers 5
	   In Chicago, Albert Belle hit his 45th home run, his 27th since
the All-Star break.
	   Frank Thomas, Robin Ventura and Magglio Ordonez also homered for
Chicago, which has won 11 of its last 14. The Tigers have lost
seven of 10 and are 2-5 since Larry Parrish replaced Buddy Bell as
manager.
	   Jim Parque (6-5) allowed three runs and nine hits in 5 2-3
innings, and Chad Bradford got three straight outs for his first
career save.
	   Brian Moehler (12-13), winless in seven starts since Aug. 1,
gave up six runs and six hits in 6 2-3 innings.

China claims success in anti-smuggling drive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese authorities are claiming substantial
progress in a campaign to curb rampant smuggling, although problems
in enforcement persist, the official newspaper China Daily reported
Tuesday.
	   Between July 15 and Aug. 15, border police seized more than 44.4
million yuan (dlrs 5.37 million) worth of contraband, including 54
ships, 3,464 boxes of cigarettes, 32 vehicles, 18,364 tons of
refined oil and 1,350 tons of refined sugar, the report said.
	   Authorities have been putting special emphasis on combatting
smuggling of weapons. During the same one-month period, they
confiscated 63 guns and 1,564 grenades, it said.
	   The campaign also has led to the arrests of 83 people suspected
of trafficking in illegal drugs and the closures of two illicit
drug manufacturing plants, the newspaper said.
	   In late July, the government ordered the military to stop
running businesses and to end its apparently extensive involvement
in smuggling operations.
	   Li Jizhou, a vice minister of Public Security, acknowledged that
there were problems with anti-smuggling enforcement within frontier
troops, the newspaper reported.
	   Those involved in smuggling would be punished according to the
law regardless of who they are or what department they belong to,
it cited Li as saying.
