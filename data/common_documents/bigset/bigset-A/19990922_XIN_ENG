<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting President of
Bosnia and Herzegovina Alija Izetbegovic on Tuesday invited
Kuwaiti companies and businessmen to invest more money in his
country.
</P>
<P>
"The objective behind my visit to Kuwait is to invite
companies to take part in the privatization process of my
country," Izetbegovic told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had conveyed the request to Kuwaiti Emir Jaber
Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian president, who arrived here Monday on a three-day
visit, held talks earlier in the day with Jaber on ways of
boosting bilateral ties and issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was among the first countries to recognize Bosnia and
Herzegovina as an independent state. The two countries established
diplomatic relations in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic last visited Kuwait in 1993, when he held talks
with Jaber on the situation in Bosnia and means of solving the
Bosnian-Serb conflict.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Bosnia are also bound by several cooperative
agreements. The two sides signed in 1997 an agreement to
encourage and protect investment in both countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development extended 6
million Kuwait dinars (19.8 million U.S. dollars) in loans to the
Bosnia Bank for the rebuilding and development of the country.

WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration

politics because of its outrage over the government's handling of
the kashmir crisis this past summer, U.S. officials said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
the officials said signs of potential instability in Pakistan
have prompted the Clinton administration to reaffirm its support

Pakistan's military leaders were indignant at Sharif's promise
to U.S. President Bill Clinton to withdraw Pakistani troops at the
height of the crisis with India this past summer over Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the military discontent, opposition parties,
which have formed a grand alliance, are also holding relentless
protests against Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said that the Clinton administration had
made the warning to the Pakistani military to fend off any threat
of subversion of the current Pakistani government.
</P>
<P>
Sharif has said that the opposition war trying to destabilize
his government rather than wait for the next round of elections in

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Tuesday that it "remains gravely concerned over the humanitarian
situation in East Timor, particularly, in West Timor".
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc reiterated its earlier appeals for allowing
immediate safe access for international humanitarian organizations
to both East and West Timor. "Refugees in West Timor must be free
to decide themselves whether they want to return to East Timor,"
the EU said in a presidency declaration released in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The European Union also praises the contribution of those UN
member states who have given troops and material support to the
International Force. "The participation of regional states is
especially important for the success of the operation," it said.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to pay tribute those Asian and, in particular, ASEAN
states who have contributed to the establishment of the
international force. It clearly shows their interest in the
maintenance of peace and security in the region," the EU said in
the declaration.
</P>
<P>
As the EU presidency on behalf of the European Union, Finland
said in the statement that the progress in the development of the
International Force in East Timor shows the willingness of the
international community to find a peaceful and lasting solution to
the question of East Timor based on the self-determination of the
people of East Timor. "Fear is giving way for hope in East Timor,"
it added.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Ghana Tuesday urged
the United States to reconsider its relations with Cuba, urging
Washington to engage "constructive dialogue with the Cuban
Government."
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings took
the floor at the general debate of the 54th General Assembly
session, which began Monday and will last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Following the U.S. government's recent sensitivity to the
concerns of the international community, Ghana would like to urge
it to seriously consider the resumption of indirect relations with
Cuba," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that such contacts would yield desired
results especially if they take place in the context of
constructive dialogue with the Cuban Government," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his "concern over the continued non-compliance
with key United Nations resolutions which call for an end to the
commercial and financial embargo against Cuba."
</P>
<P>
"It is our sincere conviction that the economic blockade of
three decades and more vintage against Cuba and the Helms-Burton
and D'Amato legislation are a breach of international law and a
violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Washington suspended its relations with Cuba on January 3,
1961, and the Clinton administration continued blockade and
embargo against Cuba despite the international community called
for the lifting of the unilateral measures against the island
country.

<HEADLINE> Iran Praises Iranian-Russian Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Minister of Higher
Education Mostafa Moin said Tuesday that a science and technology
agreement signed between Iran and Russia mark a turning point in
the strategic bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the important agreement was signed only one day
after the limitations announced by the U.S. on Iran-Russia
cooperation," the Iranian official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Russia has long been accused by the U.S. and Israel in
particular of helping Iran develop its nuclear weapons program by
training students, building a nuclear power plant in southern Iran
and providing missile technology.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. banned aid to seven Russian research and
manufacturing enterprises found to have sold sensitive weapons
technology to such countries as Iran, Libya and North Korea.
</P>
<P>
Moin said the agreement calls for bilateral cooperation in new
advanced fields of training, research and technology, material
science, energy, Caspian Sea environment and resources, refining
oil derivatives, information technology and genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will usher in new era in bilateral scientific
cooperation, Moin said, adding that "raising the attendance of
Iranian students with scholarship in Russian university is also
envisioned in the agreement."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the country will benefit from such
agreements by standing firmly against the hurried and aggressive
limitations imposed by the U.S. on Iran-Russia cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement has been ratified by Iranian cabinet and Russian
government and the lower house Duma, he added.

<HEADLINE> Northern Irish Feuding Leaders Hold Face-to-Face Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Chaired by U.S. mediator
George Mitchell, Norther Ireland's feuding Protestant and Roman
Catholice politicians held crucial face-to-face talks on Tuesday
to review the problems plaguing the historic Good Friday
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The talks, held in the province's capital Belfast, were the
first round-table session as part of Mitchell's review, which he
launched three weeks ago at the invitation of the British and
Irish governments.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble, and Sinn Fein
leader Gerry Adams, brought together by Mitchell, attended the
talks aimed at overcoming weeks of deadlock.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the talks, Adams and Trimble, disputed over the
creation of a coalition provincial government and guerrilla
disarmament, challenged each other's commitment to the agreement
signed in April last year.
</P>
<P>
Adams said his movement, which has accused Trimble's UUP of
footdragging, doubted the unionists had the "political will" to
implement the agreement.
</P>
<P>
But Trimble insisted that it was up to Sinn Fein, the political
wing of the Irish Republican Army, to honor its commitments.
</P>
<P>
It was the first top level meeting of delegations between the
parties since abortive talks chaired by British and Irish prime
ministers in July.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell's officials played down any prospect of an early
breakthrough and said the former senator, who has met the parties
individually, has not tabled new proposals.
</P>
<P>
UUP and Sinn Fein spokesmen said they were approaching
Tuesday's meeting in a positive frame of mind.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said unionists were prepared to give republicans "time
and space" to meet their commitments.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein insists it is striving for disarmament but cannot
force the IRA to hand in guns. It accuses unionists of blocking
the accord's implementation at every turn.
</P>
<P>
"There is no formula (to end the stalemate) on the table at
this stage," said a spokesman for Mitchell.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Currency to Devalue: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean dollar is
forecast to fall by more than 30 percent against the U.S. dollar
before the end of the year in the wake of speculation that the
government is under pressure to allow the currency to float.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe News Agency Tuesday quoted analysts as saying that
the local currency would be trading at between 48 and 50 to the
greenback by December this year.
</P>
<P>
The forecast comes in the speculation on the foreign currency
market in the wake of the pressure on the government by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to allow market forces to
determine the level of the Zimbabwean dollar.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in January this year, the Bankers' Association of
Zimbabwe introduced informal currency controls, which have kept
the Zimbabwean dollar at 38.15 against the U.S. dollar since
March.
</P>
<P>
The free trading of the Zimbabwean dollar was one of the
conditions in the government's letter of intent to the IMF, said
the association.
</P>
<P>
According to the new agreement agreed between the Zimbabwean
government and the IMF, the latter will provide 193 million U.S
dollars stand-by support to Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> S. African Current Account Balance Goes Back into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's current
account balance plunged 3.4 billion rand (about 557 million U.S.
dollars) in the second quarter ending in June due mainly to lower
merchandise exports.
</P>
<P>
It was a reversal of a 4.9 billion-rand (800 million dollars)
surplus in the first three months of the year, according to the
seasonally adjusted and annualized data released by the South
African Reserve Bank in Johannesburg Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the balance of payments on current account, the
bank stated: "The major part of the deterioration -- approximately
four-fifths of the absolute change in the current account balance
-- was due to a decline in exports."
</P>
<P>
The central bank revealed in its latest quarterly bulletin that
 merchandise exports had fallen from 148.4 billion rand (24.3
billion dollars) in the March quarter to 141.5 billion rand (23.1
billion dollars) by June 30.
</P>
<P>
Net gold exports were down over the same period from 24.7
billion rand (4.02 billion dollars) to 23.8 billion rand (3.9
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The bank said the volume of merchandise imports increased by
about one percent in the second quarter. These imports were mainly
manufacturing equipment which augured well for faster domestic
demand growth.
</P>
<P>
The merchandise imports rose from 142.9 billion rand (23.4
billion dollars) in the previous quarter to 143.7 billion rand
(23.6 billion dollars) in the June quarter.
</P>
<P>
The 557-million-dollar deficit was however a far cry from the
third and fourth quarters of 1998 when deficits of 19.8 billion
rand (3.2 billion dollars) and 18.5 billion rand (3 billion
dollars) respectively were recorded.

<HEADLINE> Soil Erosion Endangers Ethiopian Fertile Land: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has encountered
an increasing expansion of soil erosion, which will bring about
degradation upon the productive lands, Italian scholar Paolo Billi
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Billi, professor of Ferrara University of Italy, said in a
lecture that much of the fertile land of Ethiopia has currently
been washed away by soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
The professor attributed the extensive soil erosion mainly to
the wide- range of deforestation over the last few decades,
climatic change and mismanagement of the soil.
</P>
<P>
Some parts of Ethiopia would be endangered of desertification,
which in turn could aggravate soil erosion, he said.
</P>
<P>
The initial gully could develop its volume by 25 percent in a
single rains season, he said, "The situation unfortunately remains
irreversible once developed into a higher extent."
</P>
<P>
The professor stressed the need to further enhance
afforestation and irrigation development to address the growing
threat of soil erosion in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, owing to soil erosion and
increasing population, the average land holding of Ethiopian
farmers have decreased from 1.8 hectares in 1988 to 0.8 hectares
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Responsibility Be Shared for Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Amid debate over how
to respond to humanitarian crisis, U.S. President Bill Clinton
said here Tuesday that the responsibility should be shared for
preventing or stopping such kind of catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
Addressing world leaders at the general debate of the U.N.
General Assembly, the president said that to strengthen the
capacity of the international community to prevent and stop the
outbreaks of mass killing and displacement "will require a shared
responsibility."
</P>
<P>
"I know some are troubled that the United States and others
cannot respond to every humanitarian catastrophe in the world. We
cannot do everything, everywhere," said Clinton, who flew here
from Washington D.C. early this morning.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to a call made by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday for prompt humanitarian intervention where ever crisis
occurs. The New York Times said Monday the United States should be
blamed for the failure to halt massacre in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The Americans prefer to let such regional organizations as NATO
and the organization of African Unity play a greater part in
quelling ethnic violence and regional conflicts. The
conservative-dominant Congress has limited the administration's
capability to intervene in places of trouble by cutting its
spending in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States led the NATO allied force earlier
this year in extensive bombardment of Yugoslavia in the wake of
Kosovo crisis. The military operations, without authorization from
the Security Council, have challenged the status of the U.N. and
triggered off heated debate on how to respond to humanitarian
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Had we chosen to do nothing in the face of this brutality, I
don't believe we would have strengthened the U.N. We would have
risked discrediting the U.N.," said President Clinton in defense
of the NATO military intervention against criticism from some
countries including Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
The critics complained that the U.S.-led NATO military
operation has set a "dangerous precedence" in the U.N. history by
using force against a sovereign state without authorization from
the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Clinton argued that the response in every case should not be
the same, believing that either collective military force, or
concerted economic and political pressure combined with diplomacy
could be chosen under different circumstances and depending on
national interests.
</P>
<P>
He made no direct reference to the ongoing debate over whether
human rights should precede state sovereignty. However, he made
humanitarian intervention one of his three themes addressed at the
U.N. Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The president firstly urged for an unrelenting battle against
extreme poverty and for shared prosperity so that no part of
humanity is left behind in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
He said he would push for the development of new vaccines to
narrow the gap in health between the rich and poor countries.
</P>
<P>
On weapons proliferation, Clinton vowed to continue to contain
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, while warning against the fall of
deadly weapons into the hands of terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to ease the suffering of the Iraqi people. At
the same time, we cannot allow Saddam (Hussein) to flout 40
successive U.N. Security Council resolutions and rebuild his
arsenal," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton agreed that the U.N. was indispensable in meeting the
challenges facing the international community, pledging to
continue his fight with Congress over the U.S. 1.3 billion U.S.
dollar arrears to the U.N..Congress has linked the payment to
abortion and reduced contribution rates.
</P>
<P>
"It is precisely because we are committed to the U.N. that we
believe it must be managed effectively. But we also have a
responsibility to equip the U.N. with the resources it needs to be
effective," the president said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Two members of the
pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) were killed in south Lebanon
Tuesday morning, Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The casualties occurred when a SLA outpost in the central
section of the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon was
hit by Lebanese guerrillas' mortar and rocket attacks.
</P>
<P>
A SLA member was killed instantly and another died of wounds in
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's two Muslim Shiite military groups Hezbollah and Amal
claimed their fighters launched offensives against several Israeli
and SLA positions inside the zone, causing direct casualties.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, Israeli army confirmed the casualties, adding
Israeli warplanes blasted suspected targets of Lebanese guerrillas
in Iqlim Toufah area on the edge of the border enclave as a
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
The fresh fatalities raised to 16 the number of the SLA
members killed in south Lebanon since the start of this year
while 13 Israeli soldiers lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli troops and the SLA out of the country.

A budget of 32.97 billion baht (824.2 million U.S. dollars)
will be earmarked for the plan, with the Industry Ministry
authorized to coordinate programs with other agencies.
</P>
<P>
The development plan will cover the agro-industry and export
promotion, import substitution and cottage industry processing.
</P>
<P>
With 26 operating plans, it is expected to promote raw material
and product development, production efficiency, technology
upgrading, research and development, marketing competitiveness and
personnel development.
</P>
<P>
The number of jobs in the industry is forecast to increase by
between 600,000 and 700,000.
</P>
<P>
Agro-industry production could earn the country 389 billion
baht (9.72 billion dollars) a year from exports, making huge dent
in Thailand's lingering trade deficit which stands at 4.9 billion
dollars in the first seven months of this year.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects Bigger U.N. Role in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel rejected on Tuesday
the United Nations' intention to play a more active political role
in the Middle East peace process, defining the world body can only
look after economic matters in the region.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Israeli Foreign Ministry said "the basis of
the Arab-Israeli peace process since its advent with the 1991
Madrid Peace Conference has been direct, face-to-face negotiations
between the parties."
</P>
<P>
"And any attempts to alter these terms of reference, including
the involvement of the United Nations in the negotiating process,
are unacceptable to the government of Israel," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry issued this statement after learning that
Terje Roed-Larsen of Norway, who helped oversee secret talks that
led to the Oslo accords, will be appointed as U.N. special
coordinator for the Middle East peace process. U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan disclosed this in a letter in New York Monday.
</P>
<P>
Roed-Larsen is also named Annan's personal representative to
the Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Palestinian
National Authority. He is to replace Indian diplomat Chinmaya
Gharekhan.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry's statement clearly indicated that Israel will
not allow the U.N. to play the role in the process beyond the
economic areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel has repeatedly clarified to the U.N. and its
representatives that it can not accept an expansion of the title,
mandate and powers of the outgoing U.N. special coordinator,
Chinmaya Gharekhan, beyond the economic functional areas, to which
he was charged.
</P>
<P>
Gharekhan will leave his post on September 30 as U.N. special
representative to multilateral talks on Middle East Peace and as
U.N. special coordinator in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Roed-Larsen will take up his new post on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in his letter that Roed-Larsen will have the task of
making appropriate preparations within the U.N. for enhancing its
development assistance in support of the peace process and
represent him in discussions with the parties and the
international community in all matters related to continuing
United Nations support to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Reod-Larsen's base of operations will remain in Gaza, Annan
said.

<HEADLINE> Joint Efforts to Curb Angola-Namibia Border Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Angolan official
Tuesday called for the Angola-Namibia union of defense and
security forces in joint actions against the organized crime along
the common frontier.
</P>
<P>
Vice Defense Minister General Demosthenes Amos Chilingutila
made the call here at the opening ceremony of a meeting of Angolan
and Namibian experts on defense and security before the sixth
ministerial session of a mixed commission scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The necessary cooperation in combating the organized crime in
the two countries and the actions of the people loyal to (Jonas)
Savimbi, either in Angola or in north Namibia, concretely in the
Caprivi Strip, deserves an immediate response from the Namibian
defense and security forces," said the Angolan official.
</P>
<P>
Chilingutila, head of the Angolan delegation for the bilateral
meeting, pointed out that the rebels of the National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas Savimbi had
taken advantage of the period posterior to the signature of the
1994 Lusaka peace accord for rearming themselves, recruiting new
soldiers, training them and organizing them in new units.
</P>
<P>
The rebel movement UNITA has controled over some rural areas
and the east and southeast frontier.
</P>
<P>
During a battle against the separatist militants in the
northeast Caprivi Strip in early August this year, the Namibian
government captured and then expelled seven UNITA members.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Namibian separatists smashed by the
government troops have fled into south Angola and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government made a quick response to the incident by
saying that it will help capture the Namibian rebels.
</P>
<P>
At the fifth session of the mixed commission on September 24,
1998, Angola and Namibia signed a protocol on cooperation in
security and defense, in a bid to reinforce the security of the
common frontier, crack down on the robberies of cars and animals
and fight against the organized criminals.

<HEADLINE> Nepali FM Stresses Good Ties With China, India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Foreign Minister Ram
Sharan Mahat said Tuesday that Nepal has maintained cordial and
cooperative relations with India and China on the basis of good
neighborliness while holding high the country's national interest.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions from MPs at the House of
Representatives Tuesday, Mahat said Nepal is alert not to allow
the Nepalese territory to be used for any activities directed
against China. He also reiterated Nepal's support to "one China"
policy.
</P>
<P>
Referring to arguments that failure to implement the provisions
made in the treaty on integrated development of the Mahakali river
for preparing the detailed project report within six months after
the signing of the treaty will bring the validity of the treaty
under question, Mahat said these arguments are not based on facts.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and India had a plan to make joint efforts to utilize the
common Mahakali river, but the plan has been delayed because of
some technical problems.
</P>
<P>
Stating that the Mahakali Treaty has been signed bearing in
mind Nepal's national priority, Mahat said a joint office of both
countries is to be set up in Kathmandu soon to work on the
preparation of the detailed project report.
</P>
<P>
Mahat told parliament that discussions are being held with
India on making necessary arrangements for entry registration to
carry out monitoring on Nepal-India border without affecting the
cross border movement of people and goods.
</P>
<P>
During Indian foreign minister's visit to Nepal earlier this
month, the foreign ministers of the two countries agreed to make
joint efforts to curb border criminal activities.

<HEADLINE> Thai Exports in First Seven Months Rise 7.8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports in the
first seven months of this year increased 7.8 percent from the
same period last year to 32.2 billion U.S. dollars, a Government
House press release said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Export volume increased 7.8 percent in the first seven months
of this year, while the value dropped 5.3 percent due to the
decline in the prices of agricultural and agro-industrial products
including rice, rubber, tapioca, frozen and canned seafood and
cane sugar.
</P>
<P>
Exports of agro-industrial products and industrial products
recorded growth in the fourth consecutive month in July, which
rose 11.6 percent and 9.8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's imports also rose 8.5 percent to 27.3
billion dollars in the first seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
In July, the country imported more vehicles and transport
equipment, up 124.1 percent, followed by raw materials and
semi-finished products.
</P>
<P>
The press release issued after the cabinet meeting Tuesday
attributed the main reason leading to the growth of exports to the
economic recovery in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The efforts made by some joint-venture companies in Thailand,
especially those producing electrical and electronic products, in
seeking new markets with the support of their parent companies
also helped the country's exports to increase as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Final Athens Quake Death Toll Reaches 143 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A total of 143 people have
been killed in the September 7 earthquake in northwestern Athens,
according to figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The final figures were released by the Greek ambulance service,
Attica hospitals and the Athens Mortuary, the semi-official Athens
News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake registering 5.9 on the Richter scale occurred at
2:56 p.m. local time, with its epicenter being in the Mount
Parnitha region, some 20 kilometers northwest of Athens.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people were injured and some 60,000 others left
homeless in the earthquake, which is estimated to cost Greece 200
billion drachmas (about 645 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Greece is the sixth most seismically active country in the
world, with earthquakes occurring in the country on an average
rate of once in every five years.
</P>
<P>
The last time Athens was shaken to such an extent was in
February 1981, when an earthquake measuring about 7.1 on the
Richter scale struck the Gulf of Corinth.

<HEADLINE> Russian Foreign Minister on U.N. Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia said here
Tuesday that it is necessary to reform the United Nations, but the
reform should be aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the world
body, so that it can stand in a better position to meet the
challenges of the mankind today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the General Assembly, Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said, "What purpose the forthcoming reform should pursue is
another thing. The reform for us, in the first place, is adoption
of a package of measures to enhance the United Nations role in the
world arena."
</P>
<P>
"Our Organization should be ready to timely and correctly
respond to the challenges that globalization presents to the
Mankind," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to seriously consider how to enhance the
efficiency of the U.N. Security Council and make this main body of
the United Nations more representative through the inclusion of
new influential members, including, which is absolutely
indispensable, developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Such a step would help to maintain the overall balance in the
system of international relations, especially in the situation
when the instances of the use of force in bypassing the Security
Council continue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The statement refers to the use of force by NATO against
Yugoslavia, which began on March 24 without the authorisation of
the Security Council, which, under the U.N. Charter, has the
primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace
and security.
</P>
<P>
"It is also beyond doubt that preservation of the Permanent
Member's right of veto is indispensable for meaningful and
efficient work of the Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In general, the entire system of international organizations
should undergo a sensible and responsible reform," he said. "At the
same time, it is necessary that the United Nations remain a focal
point of efforts of the international community aimed at settling
the most burning problems of today."

<HEADLINE> UAE Emphasizes Unified Arab Stance Against Disney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) Tuesday emphasized the need to take a unified Arab position
against Disney Corp. unless the American entertainment giant bow
to Arabs on a controversial exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries need to take a unified and decisive position
against Disney if the company does not meet Arab demands on
removing all "displays and other references distorting the
Arab-Islamic identity of Jerusalem" from its exhibition, said UAE
Minister of Information and Culture Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al
Nahyan in a telephone conversation with his Egyptian counterpart
Safwat Al Sherif.
</P>
<P>
One of Disney's exhibit in the millennium exhibition, due to
open on September 30 at the company's Epcot Center in Orlando,
Florida, depicts Jerusalem as Israel's capital, which has become
the center of a row between Disney and Arab-Islamic countries
recently.
</P>
<P>
Arabs and Muslims accuse Disney of allowing Israel to use its
pavilion to portray Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel regards the whole Jerusalem as its "eternal and
indivisible capital" while the Palestinians want Arab East
Jerusalem, captured by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war, to
be capital of the future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The UAE and some other countries have threatened to boycott
all Disney products in their markets unless the company convinces
them it will not depict Jerusalem as the Israeli capital.
</P>
<P>
Disney has explained to Arab states that it will go ahead with
the Israeli exhibit, but it will not depict occupied Jerusalem as
Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
However, the explanations are considered as "not convincing"
and Arab foreign ministers will meet on Friday in New York on the
sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly to further discuss this
issue.

</P>
<P>
The agreement was inked at the end of the second round of

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Northern Ireland's
feuding parties arrived in Belfast for crucial talks with U.S.
mediator Gerorge Mitchell on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Both Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble and Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams pledged to be positive in their first talks for two
months. The meeting is one of the most crucial in the Good Friday
agreement review.
</P>
<P>
Adams said it was up to the unionists to prove they were
prepared to implement the troubled peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"There is now a widespread view within nationalism and
republicanism that the political will is absent from the UUP
(Ulster Unionist Party)," Adams told reporters at Castle
Buildings, a government complex in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said increased violence, murders and attempted arms
smuggling in recent months put a question mark over republican
commitments to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said Sinn Fein had made commitments in the agreement to
peace and democracy, total IRA disarmament and the maintenance of
an unequivocal ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"They have not yet honored any one of those commitments. It is
time they did," Trimble told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The leaders were arriving for their first round table session
with Mitchell as part of a review, started three weeks ago, of the
problems plaguing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
It was the first top level meeting of delegations between the
parties since abortive talks chaired by British and Irish prime
ministers in July.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday expressed his sympathy with the people affected
by the massive earthquake in China's Taiwan Province.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by his spokesman reads: "The
Secretary-General learned of the earthquake that struck near
Taipei yesterday with shock and sadness.
</P>
<P>
"He expressed to the people of the Taiwan Province of China his
heartfelt sympathy at this time of trial."
</P>
<P>
A U.N. disaster assessment and coordination team is expected to
arrive in Taipei Wednesday, spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva
said.
</P>
<P>
The quake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale occurred at 1:47

<HEADLINE> Russia Seeks Clear Criteria for Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia said here
Tuesday that the authority of the U.N. Security Council should be
strengthened and clear criteria should be set for the Council's
imposition and lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister, who took the floor at the general
debate of the General Assembly, said that "The issue of
strengthening the authority of the United Nations after it has
been seriously and painfully tested by the Balkan and Iraq crises,
comes to the top of the entire agenda at the current session of
the General Assembly."
</P>
<P>
"First of all we should continue strenuous efforts to restore
the role of the Security Council in the world affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO, without the authorisation of the Security
Council, launched unilateral air strikes on Yugoslavia, thus
dealing a serious blow to the authority of the Council. Under the
U.N. Charter, the 15-nation body has the primary responsibility
for the maintenance of the international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
"We have managed through joint efforts to bring the settlement
of the Kosovo problem back within the legal and political
framework of the United Nations," he said. "Now, we need to
jointly strive for a strict and consistent implementation of
Security Council resolution 1244."
</P>
<P>
"We can not afford the re-emerging political process to be
undermined again, since this could become a tragedy for the entire
Europe and bring the World once again to the brink of
catastrophe," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Equally urgent is the issue of post-conflict rehabilitation in
the Balkans," he said. "The United Nations has an important role
to play in meeting these challenges."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of sanctions, the foreign minister said, "They can
be applied only when other means of political influence have been
exhausted and the Security Council has established the existence
fo a threat to peace."
</P>
<P>
"The Council, for its part, should be guided by clear criteria
for imposition and lifting of sanctions and should not allow any
free interpretation of adopted decisions, much less to allow their
use by anyone for selfish political ends," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to take most serious account of humanitarian
implications of sanctions both for the population of the states
subject to such sanctions and for the third countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Punishment of entire nations, especially for an indefinite
time and indiscriminately, is inadmissible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia is seeking to ease the eight-year sanctions against
Iraq, taking into account the difficulties the regime imposed on
the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Service Sector Grows But No New Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Italian service sector, the
country's fastest-growing industry, will not create any more jobs
in the short-term, despite picking up speed in the second quarter
of 1999, according to a report by Isae, the Institute for Economic
Studies and Analysis.
</P>
<P>
"Businesses saw a marked improvement in demand and turnover in
the second quarter, taking into account seasonal increases," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government's economic think-tank said the service
sector would see short-term increases in sales prices and demand,
and forecast that turnover would remain stable in the next
quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, in spite of good short-term prospects, Isae said the
service industry would not create any more jobs in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the marketing industry will be the
only sector to see an increase in payroll figures, while the
technology industry is expected to register the sharpest drop.

<HEADLINE> Britain Releases First Annual Audit of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The British government has set
out a wide-ranging strategy to lift 1.25 million people out of
poverty by the next election, according to the country's first
annual audit of poverty released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Social Security Secretary Alistair Darling described the report
as "a landmark in the campaign against poverty".
</P>
<P>
"For the first time a government is standing up to be counted
setting specific standards against which we will be judged
tackling poverty and its causes," he said.
</P>
<P>
The first annual "poverty audit", which lists 32 main
indicators of deprivation and sets out how the government will
tackle them, aims to ensure the poorest fifth of families with
children will be more than 1,000 pounds (about 1,600 U.S. dollars)
a year better off by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
Among the indicators published on Tuesday are reductions in the
proportion of children living in workless households or in poor
housing.
</P>
<P>
The government estimates there are 12 million people living in
relative poverty, nearly a quarter of the population and almost
three times as many as in 1979.
</P>
<P>
It says four million are children, with one in five children
living in workless households.
</P>
<P>
Poverty is defined as a family who live on less than half the
average income. For a family with three children, this is about
220 pounds (352 dollars) a week.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair has pledged to eliminate child
poverty by 2020.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Shares Extend Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Shares extended
losses Tuesday amid worries about recovery of the semiconductor
industry after an earthquake shook Taiwan earlier in the day and
disappointing data were released Monday on the country's external
trade in August.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) declined 13.89 points
to end at 2,109.4 in fairly quiet trading.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover dropped to 179.55 million units valued at 479.63
million Singapore dollars (282.35 million U.S. dollars). Decliners
outstripped advancers by 255 to 62 with 133 counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The larger block was the 12.94 million parcel by Hotung which
was transacted at 0.38 U.S. dollars per share. It was followed by
IPC which registered a volume of 11.34 million units. Gen Int was
the next with 11.26 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Avimo topped the gainers list, rising 70 cents to finish at
3.00 Singapore dollars. SIA and SIA 200 picked up 40 cents to
close at 18.00 and 17.90 Singapore dollars respectively. SIA
DBScw00 edged up 30 cents to end at 11.60 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, GE Life was the biggest loser of the day
incurring a loss of 100 cents to close at 17.00 Singapore dollars.
Venture sank 70 cents to finish at 14.30 Singapore dollars. Bukit
Sem shed 60 cents to end at 16.00 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said electronics stocks came under selling pressure
partly because of Monday's lower-than-expected growth in the
export of electronic products in August and partly because of
worries about the recovery of the semiconductor industry after an
earthquake struck Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
They also said Avimo's surge-up Tuesday was triggered off by
Monday's announcement by Thomson-CSF of France that it would take
a 24.9 percent stake in the firm.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Inflation Drops in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's inflation
rate dropped by 1.7 percentage points to 3.2 percent in August
compared to 4.9 percent in July, Statistics South Africa announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The drop in inflation rate was mainly due to the reduction in
the average interest rates on mortgage bonds from 21.79 percent in
August 1998 to 16.74 percent in August 1999.
</P>
<P>
The annual increase of 3.2 percent in the consumer price index
for metropolitan areas is mainly due to annual increases in the
price indices for transport, food, household operation and medical
care and health expenses.
</P>
<P>
These increases were counteracted by a relatively large annual
decrease in the price index for housing (-1.4 percentage points).
</P>
<P>
The core inflation rate for metropolitan areas was 7.9 percent
in August 1999, representing 0.3 percentage points lower than the
corresponding annual rate of 8.2 percent in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
Core inflation, which excludes mortgages rates, volatile food
item, VAT and assessment rates, is used by the central bank as
basis for its monetary policies.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Decides to Stop Using IMF Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday gave
its approval to the eighth letter of intent to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF), which says that Thailand could exit from the
IMF rescue package worth 17.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the letter of intent, Thailand will stop drawing
funds from the IMF rescue package for the time being since several
economic indicators point to a recovering economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the country wants to retain the right to draw funds
from the rest of the package when it feels necessary.
</P>
<P>
So far, Thailand has drawn 13.47 billion dollars from the
bailout package, granted to the country by the IMF in August 1997,
a month after the financial crisis broke out.
</P>
<P>
The letter of intent, the latest review between the government
and the IMF, expects the Thai economy to grow by three to four
percent, compared to the earlier government projection of one
percent.
</P>
<P>
It will be a sharp turnaround from the 10 percent contraction
recorded last year and a fall of 1.8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices have also fallen sharply, with inflation
projected at 0.5 percent for 1999 compared to 8.1 percent in 1998
and 5.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign reserves, which had depleted to only
about 800 million dollars in August 1997 after a failed baht
defense battle, have been replenished and are expected to rise to
a targeted level of 32 to 34 billion dollars by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's current account for 1999 is projected at 11.6
billion dollars, or 9.0 percent of the GDP, and overall exports
are expected to reach 55 billion dollars, an increase of four
percent.

<HEADLINE> Russia Favors Multipolar World Based on International Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia said here
Tuesday that it stands for the establishment of a multipolar world
on the solid basis of the international law.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov took
the floor at the general debate of the 54th General Assembly
session, which began Monday.
</P>
<P>
"As a world power and a Permanent Member of the U.N. Security
Council, for the world developments, Russia stands for the
establishment of a multipolar world built on the solid foundation
of the international law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our country is pursuing in practice a multivector foreign
policy with a view to, essentially establishing equitable and
mutually beneficial bilateral and multilateral relations with all
countries of the world and strengthening international security
and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
The statement challenges the U.S. efforts to seek the world
leadership since the end of the Cold War, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
"The Concept of the World involves developing a new culture,
providing for the establishment of a common system of values and a
pattern of behavior," he said. "A world without wars and
conflicts, a world of democracy and prosperity should be the
highest priority for all peoples and states."
</P>
<P>
Russia was firmly against the move by the U.S.-led NATO to
launch air strikes against Yugoslavia without the authorisation of
the 15-member Security Council, which has the primary
responsibility to maintain world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
"Every nation is entitled to its rightful place among other
nations and to equal security in all respects -- political,
military, economic, social, and other," he said.
</P>
<P>
"How and through what mechanisms could this be achieved? Is
there a body which could meet the concerns of all States in a
balanced way?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"The reply is obvious -- it is the United Nations," he said.
"From the outset, the U.N. Charter put the Organization at the
service of all Mankind. There simply does not exist any other
universal mechanism to regulate international relations."

<HEADLINE> Italy's GDP Up 0.4 Percent in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Italy's gross domestic product
(GDP) rose 0.4 percent in the second quarter of 1999 over the
first quarter, according to figures released Tuesday by the
Italian statistics bureau Istat.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the second quarter of 1998, GDP growth amounted to
0.8 percent, the same as the first quarter's growth over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Istat said that Italy's GDP figures were "more or less in line"
with other leading industrialized countries, citing France, where
GDP in the second quarter was up 0.6 percent over the first
quarter, and Britain up 0.5 percent, the US up 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We are not yet witnessing sustained growth but, on the whole,
we can start talking about moderate recovery," the bureau analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
They said that a breakdown of the data for the second quarter
over the first quarter showed that growth was fueled by
consumption, which was up 0.3 percent, while consumption of
investment goods rose 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Imports were up 1.4 percent compared to the first quater, as
were exports, on an annual basis, imports were up a substantial
3.2 percent, while exports were down 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Istat was cautious in its forecasts for the year, limiting
itself to saying that if GDP fails to grow in the third and fourth
quarters, which is unlikely, then growth for the entire year would
come to 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet its target of GDP growth of 1.2 percent in
1999, Italy will need to post a rise of around 1.6 percent in
annual terms during the second half of the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti official in
charge of dealing with the Year 2000 (Y2K) computer glitch said on
Tuesday that most of the government bodies in Kuwait have overcome
the millennium problem.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Al-Shaygi, deputy chairman of the Central Work Team
assigned to follow up the Y2K bug, told a news conference here
that the conclusion was reached after the team had analyzed the
situation of 33 government departments.
</P>
<P>
The bug dates back to the early days of computer programming
when only the last two numbers of the year were used in most
software. If the problem is not solved, some computers will read
2000 as 1900 and shut off or give wrong answers when the new
century starts.
</P>
<P>
The work team, which was formed in August by the Planning
Ministry, was responsible for examining the systems of the
computers used by government bodies and mapping out an emergency
strategy to cope with the problem.
</P>
<P>
Shaygi said government departments were divided into two
categories. The first category comprises 18, of which some have
connection with security and vital economic services and need to
be completely ready for the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
The second batch includes 34 bodies which are less risky and
have alternatives in case of emergency, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the official said that a small number of institutions are
still in need for some equipment to prepare for the global
problem.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivaonov Tuesday listed separatism as one of the main
threats and challenges facing the world today, calling upon the
United Nations to take decisive steps to crack down separatist
moves in defense of the principles of sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
"Aggressive separatism, which became a fertile soil for various
extremist forces, has turned into one of the main sources of
domestic conflicts and regional unsuitability," he said. "Nobody
is safeguarded against it."
</P>
<P>
"International community and, first of all, the United Nations
should decisively clamp down on any manifestations of separatism
and strictly and consistently defend the principles of
sovereignty, territorial integrity and inviolability of the
national borders," he said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as the Russian foreign minister was
delivering his speech at the general debate of the 53rd General
Assembly session, which, beginning Monday, is scheduled to last
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to completely eradicate instances of
encouragement and support for separatist forces from without," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully aware of the danger posed by threats and
challenges, that our world faces today, e.g. military nationalism,
separatism, terrorism and extremism regardless of their forms have
no borders," he said. "It is a common challenge claiming countless
victims and bringing destruction to various places on our planet."
</P>
<P>
"Recently separatism has been increasingly merging with the
monster of terrorism," he said. "Even during this session we could
undertake several concrete steps aimed at a move active practical
international cooperation in combating terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to finalize the draft Convention on Fighting
Acts of Nuclear Terrorism," he said. "We also propose to develop
and adopt a declaration of principles of interaction between states
with the view to stepping up the fight against terrorism."
</P>
<P>
"It is a bounded duty of states to protect their citizens
against terrorist encroachment and to prevent on their territories
activities aimed at organizing such acts against citizens of other
countries," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Russia also supports the initiative of holding an
anti-terrorist conference under the auspices of the United Nations
or a special session of the U.N. General Assembly in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"This event would give a powerful political impetus to the
struggle against terrorism at a global level," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Launch Strategic Plan Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique will launch a
National Strategic Plan to fight against the wide-spreading of
AIDS in the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The government started a conference Tuesday to discuss the
draft National Strategic Plan for the fight against Sexually
Transmitted Diseases (STD) and HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the government will allocate some 40
million U.S. dollars in the next three years to control this
deadly disease in the poverty-stricken country.
</P>
<P>
Health authorities estimate that about 700 people in the
country are getting infected with HIV every day.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the Health Ministry show that there are 11,300
people have died of AIDS since 1986, when the first case was
diagnosed in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
However, the director of the Epidemic Department in the
Ministry, Avertino Barreto, says that this figure is
underestimated.
</P>
<P>
Most AIDS deaths are not included in this figure simply
because they did not take place in any health unit. It is also
certain that many cases have gone undiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
Barreto said the current estimation of 900,000 people
suffering from AIDS in the country is believed to be lower than
the real figure.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the central province of Manica, Felicio Zacarias,
said that his province is one of the most affected by AIDS because
of poverty, associated with illiteracy and poor access to health
care.
</P>
<P>
"Because of all this we find ourselves in a situation, where
AIDS has started affecting the development of our provinces,
creating instability in work places, and destroying the social
family fabric. All in all, it tends to throw us into even greater
poverty," said Zacarias.

<HEADLINE> S. African Economy Regains Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The South African
economy has regained some growth momentum over the past three
quarters, supported by the recovery in the Asian economies, the
bullish U.S. economy and the general easing of domestic monetary
conditions.
</P>
<P>
This was said Tuesday in the latest quarterly bulletin of the
South African Reserve Bank (SARB).
</P>
<P>
The central bank said the growth in real gross domestic product
(GDP) had accelerated progressively from the last quarter of 1998
and reached an annualized rate of 1.5 percent in the second
quarter of this year when it was boosted by a healthy increase in
agricultural output.
</P>
<P>
"Among the main non-agricultural sectors of the economy, it was
the service-providing sectors, more particularly the
telecommunications industry, that set the pace for output
expansion.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the growth spurt in the second quarter, aggregate
output in the first half of 1999 was about the same as in the
first half of 1998, indicating negligible year-on-year growth in
the first half of 1999. Considering the low levels of production
in the second half of 1998, continuation of the current output
recovery would take real GDP in 1999 as a whole to a level higher
than that in 1998."
</P>
<P>
The SARB said the broadly defined M3 monetary supply had
expanded relatively slowly during the first seven months of this
year.
</P>
<P>
It stated: "Year-on-year growth in the M3 money supply remained
in the lower half of the six to 10 percent guideline range
indicated by the Reserve Bank as acceptable monetary growth in the
medium term."

<HEADLINE> SADC Central Banks Prepare for Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Central banks of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) are developing the
financial architecture which could form the basis of closer
regional economic integration, South African Reserve Bank Governor
Tito Mboweni said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni, who is also the chairperson of the SADC committee of
central bank governors, said the committee was slowly but surely
laying the foundation for a robust regional economic bloc.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the University of Pretoria, Mboweni said the SADC
finance and investment sector was convinced that it had already
laid the foundation for macroeconomic convergence and integration.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni would make every effort to ensure "that we continue
with the construction of a strong financial infrastructure for the
region, so that globalization can work to the advantage of the
Southern African region."
</P>
<P>
A target implementation date had been set for January next year
to begin the process of lowering trade barriers, streamlining
customs and border procedures, and harmonizing external tariffs,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that South Africa plans to eliminate most duties
on imported goods from other SADC countries by 2004, and the
region could ultimately develop into a free trade zone."
</P>
<P>
The work being done by the committee of central bank governors
constituted an important building block toward the creation of a
free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot implement free trade in goods and services without
having the proper financial systems in place. The work of the
Committee of Central Bank Governors can be seen as providing the
oil that makes the wheels of commerce turn faster in the region."
</P>
<P>
Before full economic integration could be attained, the region
needed sound financial systems that could withstand sudden
international shocks and which could accommodate increased
economic activity.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Voices Confidence in United Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Ghana Tuesday voiced
its confidence in the ability of the United Nations to achieve
sustainable socio-economic development, and called for a reform
for the world body in order to enable it to be more effective to
act under the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Jerry Rawlings, president of Ghana, took
the floor at the general debate of the 54th General Assembly
session, which began Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is aggravated by the multiplicity of conflicts
that pervades the world, especially in Africa," he said.
"Intra-state conflicts, rooted in ethnic, racial and religious
intolerance pose a threat to the security and stability of many
states and regions."
</P>
<P>
"In spite of such setbacks and disappointments, we must
continue to maintain trust and confidence in the U.N.'s ability
to achieve sustainable socio-economic development for member
states," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But that confidence will be sustained only when the
Organization is seen to be truly seeking the interest of all
member states, without exception," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In that regard, member states must give impetus to the reform
process that we initiated a decade ago and maintain its dynamism,"
he said. "We also must accept that the core of the reform touches
on the Security Council whose decisions bind all members of the
Organization."
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council must therefore not be allowed to become
irrelevant," he said. "It should be reformed to ensure that it can
undertake its responsibility more effectively under the Charter."
</P>
<P>
"This reform must be guided by the principles of democracy,
sovereign equality of states and equitable geographical
representation," he said.

<HEADLINE> SADC Defense Chiefs to Meet in Swaziland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Defense chiefs from
Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries will meet
in Swaziland Wednesday to discuss conflicts in the region, a Swazi
army spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted the spokesman, Sotja Dlamini, as
saying that the defense chiefs would hold two days of talks in the
convention center in the Swaziland capital, Mbabane.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini later told reporters that the meeting would discuss the
ongoing conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
and in Angola.
</P>
<P>
"The defense chiefs will also discuss other matters pertaining
to security in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that all 14 members of SADC would be represented at
the conference.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in the Swazi kingdom follows talks in Pretoria on
Monday between the defense ministers of South Africa and Zimbabwe,
and Swaziland Foreign Minister Albert Shabangu, over a southern
African policy for dealing with regional wars.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the meetings, Shabangu told reporters afterwards,
is the development of a protocol governing SADC's reaction to
"situations that require intervention, peacekeeping or peace
enforcement."
</P>
<P>
The protocol is expected to be endorsed by all 14 SADC members,
said Shabangu, who heads the SADC inter-state defense and security
committee.
</P>
<P>
But he added that it was too early to say when the protocol
would be ready.
</P>
<P>
SADC's defense policy came under scrutiny last year when South
Africa and Botswana launched a joint military intervention mission
in the troubled kingdom of Lesotho to stave off a coup.

<HEADLINE> Summers Says U.S. Continues to Help Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Tuesday it would continue to support Russia or risk being branded
as "scapegoats" for Russia's failure but should not back any new
multinational loans until adequate safeguards were ensured.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the hearing of the Banking Committee of the House,
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said the administration will
support Russia in economic development in spite of allegations
that aid to Russia has been illegally diverted.
</P>
<P>
"The American people have an enormous national security,
economic, and law enforcement stake in a peaceful and successful
transition to a law-based, democratic market economy in Russia,"
Summers told the congressmen.
</P>
<P>
The panel planned a series of hearings into the allegations
that up to 10 billion U.S. dollars including aid from the
international institutions have been channeled illegally to the
Bank of New York in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Citing the nuclear arsenal Russia still has and the importance
of a strong and stable global economy, Summer stressed that the
United States has crucial interests in supporting Russia's
economic and political reform.
</P>
<P>
"Acting on that view would limit our ability to support Russian
economic and financial stability... it would raise the risk that
the United States and the West would be labeled as scapegoats for
Russia's failure to address its problems," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
"To quarantine, contain or write off Russia as too corrupt
would ill serve our national interest," Summers told the
committee.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the "crucial multilateral tool to support
economic reform in Russia has been conditional finance from the
international financial institutions."
</P>
<P>
"Given the pervasive problems in the rule of law in Russia,
we do not believe at this point that the provision of new funds
would be constructive," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
The current allegations involving money laundering through
major American banks "only reinforce our recognition that
widespread corruption in Russia can pose a significant danger to
our interests," he added.
</P>
<P>
Safeguarding the integrity of the U.S. financial system was a
key priority, said Summers. "We are committed to the full
investigation of these allegations."
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration plans to unveil Thursday a new
strategy on fighting money-laundering.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said
Russia also wants to have a full investigation of the allegations
because people of Russia are the victims if the allegations were
proved to be true.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov made the remarks when meeting U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in New York while they attended the U.N.
Assembly meeting.

<HEADLINE> Bell Atlantic Acquires Vodafone For Wireless Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Bell Atlantic, the U.S.
largest local telephone company, agreed Tuesday to acquire
mobile phone network of Vodafone AirTouch in its effort to
create a wireless network.
</P>
<P>
The wireless phone alliance will be able to serve more than
90 percent of the U.S. population with digital technology. The
agreement will combine Bell Atlantic's East Coast network with
Vodafone's West Coast network, enabling customers to use their
wireless phones almost anywhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Bell Atlantic will give Vodafone a 45 percent stake in the
new company in exchange for Vodafone's 15 billion-U.S.-dollar
wireless network. The new alliance will have assets of 28
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after AT&AMP;T Corp., the U.S. largest long
distance phone company, formed a global alliance with British
Telecom to link their wireless telephone operations, providing
wireless services in 17 countries with a combined customer base
of 41 million.

<HEADLINE> More S. Africans Lose Jobs Amid Gold Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- There were fewer people
in jobs in South Africa by the end of the first quarter of this
year than at the same time a year before with the gold mining and
construction industries the hardest hit, it was disclosed on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The South African Reserve Bank said in its latest quarterly
bulletin that at end of March the number of workers employed in
the regularly surveyed formal sectors of the economy outside
agriculture was down by 42, 000 or 0.8 percent from 12 months
before.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from the weakness of aggregate output growth, employment
was also constrained by constant pressures on domestic producers
to be more competitive in an increasingly integrated international
economy, continued increases in the cost of employing labor and
the progress made by government with containing the growth of the
public service and at the same time raising the quality of public
service delivery," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"The impact of these employment-constraining factors moderated
somewhat over the past year and a half and job losses in the
private sector slowed down from 2.6 percent (seasonally adjusted
and annualized) in the third quarter of 1998 to 1.4 percent in the
fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> Mexico, EU to Start New Round of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
and Mexico will begin their eighth round of trade talks on October
7, said a spokesman from the EU Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from Brussels, the meeting
was scheduled to be held in Mexico on September 27, but was
postponed because the EU are still analyzing their proposal.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the European Commission said that the
Europeans want the next meeting to be "substantial" now that they
have planned to make a definitive agreement in their negotiations
with Mexico before the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
He added that the rules of origin are a very delicate theme
because the EU has certain ruling norms, and making a change with
Mexico signifies changes within the EU also.
</P>
<P>
The rules of origin are a very sensitive theme in the
negotiations it has with Mexico, as they determine the conditions
which a product must adhere, with respect to Value Added Tax
(VAT).
</P>
<P>
Another of the delicate themes which are included in the next
negotiations is the lowering of duties of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The EU are offering Mexico 82 percent of industrial products
free of tariffs, once the agreement is begun; the other 18 percent
to be applied in the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
For their part, the Mexican authorities proposed a lowering of
duties for periods which would begin with 48 percent at the
beginning of the agreement, a further 4 percent in 2003, another 6
percent in the year 2005, and the remaining 42 percent in the year
2007.

NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Congolese rebels have
confirmed the meeting with the representative of the Rome-based
San Egidio Community about its future mediation role in the
Congolese crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We met San Egidio Community's delegation and we discussed
their proposal to be the facilitator in the future national debate
suggested in the Lusaka peace accord," Moise Nyarugabo, the
Vice-President of the main Congolese rebel movement, the Congolese
Rally for Democracy (RCD) told Rwanda News Agency RNA on Tuesday.

<P>
Nyarugabo said that discussions were just at its initial stage

Zuppi who was leading the delegation.
</P>
<P>
San Egidio Community achieved its fame in negotiating the end
to the war in Mozambique between ruling Frelimo and rebel Renamo
parties.

<P>
"We are discussing the opportunity offered to us by San Egidio
Community. We will give our response to their initiative in the

Political analysts said that the RCD will reject the mediation
of San Egidio Community for it is seen as close to President
fighting to President Laurent Desire Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"The choice of a mediator is an affair of Congolese. None can
impose us any person we have not agreed upon," Nyarugabo
highlighted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Organization of African Unity (OAU) could play
a greater role in bringing together all parties to the Congolese
crisis so that they can discuss and convene on a mediator.
</P>
<P>
''Its (OAU) role would be to coordinate and harmonize different
 proposals regarding the mediator, the venue, and the
participants," Nyarugabo told RNA.

<HEADLINE> Wolfensohn Calls For Intensifying Fight Against Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President Jim
Wolfensohn called here Tuesday for intensifying the fight against
poverty as the world is entering into a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
As the economic statistics are a lot better in East Asia this
year, "the thing that is of still deepest concern to us is that
the poverty levels are so high," Wolfensohn said at a press
conference before the start of the annual meetings of the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
He said that in a number of days there will be 6 billion people
on the planet, and of them, 3 billion will live under two dollars
a day, and 1.3 billion under one dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
In the next 25 years there will be 8 billion people on the
planet, and if nothing is done, 4 billion will live under two
dollars a day and up to 2 billion in extreme poverty, he added.
</P>
<P>
Forgiving debt is a very important precondition to dealing with
poverty, but forgiving debt itself doesn't generate money and it
doesn't generate a flow of resources, Wolfensohn said.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we've had development assistance as well and unless we
have an additional commitment from countries around the world who
are concerned with this issue, we achieve something with debt
forgiveness," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said it is important for people in developed and
developing countries to recognize that poverty is everybody's

DAR ES SALAAM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Deputy
Minister of Finance, Prof. Crispin Hauli, Tuesday criticized
accountants who abuse their professional credibility and fuel
corruption practices in the country.
</P>
<P>
Hauli made the charge in a speech named "On the role of the
profession in fighting against corruption" at a one-day workshop
on the status of Tanzanian accounting and auditing functions in
Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He challenged accountants to safeguard the professional
credibility, integrity and reputation in the public eyes.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister called on the accountants not to turn their
noble profession into a corruption agent.
</P>
<P>
"Accountants are highly vulnerable to corruption. Some
accountants make fraudulent claims with everything properly
accounted. Some falsify stock records to cover up cash taken or
create fictitious debtors.

LUSAKA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Association for
Chambers of Commerce and Industry Tuesday urged to increase trade
with its neighbor of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The Association Chairman George Chabwera said his country's
annual imports from Kenya remained at six million U.S. dollars for
the last three years, while Zambia's annual exports to Kenya
increased from two million dollars in 1994 to four million last
year.
</P>
<P>
He told a visiting delegation from Kenya Association of
Manufacturers that the common tariffs being put in place by the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) will not
make sense if inter-African trade is not promoted.
</P>
<P>
Chabwera urged the delegation to explore investment in his
country.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Kenyan delegation Kulwant Chadha said the bilateral
trade is being hindered by the problem of transportation.

<HEADLINE> Official Calls for Reform of  African Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- African countries cannot
reverse the negative trends of poverty and diseases unless a
common vision for local government is developed in the next
millennium, an official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
President of the African Union of Local Authorities (AULA)
Patrick Wanyeraw was speaking at the start of a three-day
ministers conference on " challenges facing local government in
Africa in the 21st century" in Victoria Falls town, Zimbabwe News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the common vision should resolve issues such as making
local government more democratic, transparent and accountable to
citizens.
</P>
<P>
"AULA notes with a degree of satisfaction that central
government ministers responsible for local government in Africa
have begun to take an unavoidable active part in seriously
reviewing the manner in which local government has been
functioning," he said.
</P>
<P>
!0They are trying to come up with a common position regarding
local development and setting up a sustainable local government
institutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said AULA was developing a worldwide charter of local
governance which would be presented to the United Nations General
Assembly in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
He said the idea of the charter was to agree on a general local
 government framework and principles within which nations could
design their systems of governance at local level.
</P>
<P>
"It should also be appreciated that local government is not
sitting idle in view of the important lobbying central governments
are doing in respect of debt burdens that are causing havoc among
our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local governments were also putting pressure to encourage rich
nations to review the terms of debts owed by poor African nations,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The broad objective of the conference which opened on Tuesday
is to provide an opportunity for ministers together with town
clerks and mayors to share experience and lessons emanating from
ongoing process of decentralization and related reforms.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 participants from 14 countries are attending the
conference.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Says Israel Will Not Pay Any Price for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said in an interview with French daily Le Monde published on
Tuesday that Israel will not pay any price for making peace with
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel will not make any compromise about the
status of Jerusalem, claimed as the capital city by both Israelis
and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Listen, our position is clear: a Jerusalem united, eternal
capital of Israel, one point, that's all," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the eastern part of Jerusalem from Jordan in
the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
He also said although talks will be tough, peace process is the
only way for both Israel and its Arab neighbors to go out of the
present impasse.
</P>
<P>
"If we make them (Palestinians) understand that we will not
compromise on our vital interests in security matters but at the
same we want peace and are ready to listen to their needs and
their interests, I think we will get a deal," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said that Israel will not make peace at any price or
under any condition.
</P>
<P>
Barak gave the interview in the Israeli Defense Ministry, where
he still holds the minister's portfolio, before starting his visit
to Europe on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Palestinians signed a new agreement this month on a
partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank in
exchange for peace with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that no one should expect him to dismantle or
downsize the defense capacities of Israel, because "our strength
will remain the only guarantee of our survival for years, even
generations."
</P>
<P>
"But instead of continuing to invest such resources to face off
a perpetual animosity, why not try seriously to solve in depth the
questions which cause such animosity?" he said.

<HEADLINE> African Ministers Call on Decentralization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 21 (Xinhua) (C African ministers attending a
local government conference in Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls Tuesday
resolved to lobby their respective countries to implement the
policy of decentralization as a way of promoting development,
accountability and transparency.
</P>
<P>
Gambia's Secretary of State for Local Government, Lands and
Religious Affairs Lamin Kaba Bajo said there was need to muster
more political and administrative support for decentralization.
</P>
<P>
He said this was because there were many cases of central
government reluctance to devolve authority and create enabling
environments for decentralization and local empowerment.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's minister of local government Jaberi Bindandi-Sali said
raising civic competence, improving service delivery,
democratizing society and mounting an effective attack against
poverty presupposes the establishment of a transparent,
representative local government system.
</P>
<P>
He said such a system required several pre-conditions in order
to take root and flourish, such as the devolution of power to
local governments and enacting legislation to clearly articulate
the respective roles of central and local governments.
</P>
<P>
Sali said local government councilors and civil servants should
also have a clear understanding of their respective roles and
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
"Effective revenue mobilization, both internal and external,
must be undertaken and the system must enjoy total conviction and
commitment at the highest political levels," he said.
</P>
<P>
Other ministers said the policy of decentralization should be
enshrined in constitutions.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Force Stands by in Darwin for East Timor Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. troops to be
involved in a multinational force in East Timor are now standing
by in Australia and will be near its full strength of 200 by
Wednesday, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They would remain in Darwin, Australia, until the Australian
commander of the multinational force, Maj. Gen. Peter Gosgrove,
decides they are needed in East Timor, said P.J. Crowley, deputy
assistant secretary of defense for public affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We are set to go whenever the commander feels those
capabilities are needed," Crowley told a Pentagon briefing.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. troops include mostly specialists in communications,
supply and intelligence with no combat troops.
</P>
<P>
There are only two U.S. soldiers -- a Marine liaison officer
and a public affairs officer -- in East Timor Tuesday after Marine
Brig. Gen. John Castellaw and four other marines returned to
Darwin where the U.S. force have reached 140. Another 50 soldiers
from around the Pacific were expected by Wednesday. And 14 civil
affairs personnel left Fort Bragg, N.C., for Darwin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the ground force, 527 U.S. personnel were
aboard two U.S. Navy ships in the area -- the guided missile
cruiser USS Mobile Bay and the ammunition ship USNS Kilavea,
Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
Three U.S. helicopters were available on the ships for
possible use in East Timor and a Marine KC 130 cargo plane had
made at least one flight carrying Australians into the region,
Crowley added. Three other U.S. transport planes also were in
Darwin for the operation.

<HEADLINE> SADC Central Banks Prepare for Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Central banks of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) are developing the
financial architecture which could form the basis of closer
regional economic integration, South African Reserve Bank Governor
Tito Mboweni said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni, who is also the chairperson of the SADC committee of
central bank governors, said the committee was slowly but surely
laying the foundation for a robust regional economic bloc.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the University of Pretoria, Mboweni said the SADC
finance and investment sector was convinced that it had already
laid the foundation for macroeconomic convergence and integration.
</P>
<P>
Mboweni would make every effort to ensure "that we continue
with the construction of a strong financial infrastructure for the
region, so that globalization can work to the advantage of the
Southern African region."
</P>
<P>
A target implementation date had been set for January next year
to begin the process of lowering trade barriers, streamlining
customs and border procedures, and harmonizing external tariffs,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that South Africa plans to eliminate most duties
on imported goods from other SADC countries by 2004, and the
region could ultimately develop into a free trade zone."
</P>
<P>
The work being done by the committee of central bank governors
constituted an important building block toward the creation of a
free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot implement free trade in goods and services without
having the proper financial systems in place. The work of the
Committee of Central Bank Governors can be seen as providing the
oil that makes the wheels of commerce turn faster in the region."
</P>
<P>
Before full economic integration could be attained, the region
needed sound financial systems that could withstand sudden
international shocks and which could accommodate increased
economic activity.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Urges Security Council to Promote Peace in Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba Tuesday called on the U.N. Security Council to
authorize and support the deployment of a peacekeeping force in
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and assist with resources
for the economic reconstruction and development in the African
country.
</P>
<P>
The president, who mediated a ceasefire among warring parties
in Congo (K), made the appeal at an open meeting of the 15-nation
Security Council, held at the request of Gabon.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to request the Security Council to, among other things,
authorize and support the deployment of a peacekeeping force in
the DRC with an appropriate mandate and size, based on the
assessed needs on the ground," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He also called upon the Security Council to "quickly dispatch
the Technical Survey team to the DRC, in addition to the team of
Military Liaison personnel which has already been sent to the DRC
and some neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that the Security Council should "make
available adequate resources for the DRC peacekeeping mission,"
and "extend necessary and adequate support to facilitate the
process of internal Congolese dialogue."
</P>
<P>
He also asked the Security Council "to help in the mobilization
of humanitarian assistance to Congolese refugees and internally
displaced persons, and facilitate their return and resettlement,"
and "assist with resources for the economic reconstruction and
development of the DRC."
</P>
<P>
The president reminded the Security Council "that there is a
perception that the U.N., and in particular the Security Council,
is usually slow and reluctant to support peace efforts in Africa."
</P>
<P>
"The body is seen to be more forth-coming when dealing with
peace efforts in other regions, even though Africa forms the
largest component of the membership of the U.N.," he said. "I,
therefore, hope that the Security Council will act with due
proportion and understanding in dealing with the situation in the
DRC."
</P>
<P>
The open meeting came one day before defense ministers from the
14-nation Southern African Development Community is scheduled to
hold a meeting in Swaziland to discuss wars in the DRC and Angola
that threaten the stability in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of a year-long mediation by African countries, a
ceasefire to end the Congo (K) conflict was first signed by Congo
(K) and its allies, Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe, and rebel
backers Rwanda and Uganda. The peace accord was later endorsed
by a rebel group on August 31.
</P>
<P>
The brutal 13-month war has displaced hundreds of thousands of
people and is seen as a major threat to stability and development
in Africa.

LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- European markets closed firmly
in the red Tuesday after a larger-than-expected U.S. trade deficit
further deepened the gloom caused by fears of higher interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
London posted the biggest losses, with the FTSE 100 touching a

of this week's meeting of oil producing countries to discuss
production limits.
</P>
<P>
BP Amoco, which closed down 1.7 percent, and Shell down 3.6
percent dominated the Footsie and their falls dragged the whole
index downwards.

<P>
Rate-sensitive financial stocks were the biggest losers on the
session, wiping some 20 points off the index. Insurer Sun Life &AMP;
Provincial was the biggest decliner on the FTSE as it tumbled 7.7

<HEADLINE> Israel Angry About Mandate of Newly-Named UN Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Tuesday
protested that the newly appointed U.N. coordinator for the
Mideast peace process has broader mandate than his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tuesday named Terje
Roed-Larsen of Norway as U.N. special coordinator for the Middle
East peace process and his Personal Representative to the
Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
Roed-Larsen will succeed Indian diplomat Chinmaya Gharekhan who
would leave his post on September 30 as U.N. special
representative to multilateral talks on Middle East peace process
and as U.N. special coordinator in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Israel's U.N. mission said Israel had
"repeatedly clarified to the U.N. and its representative that it
cannot accept an expansion of the title, mandate and powers of
the outgoing U.N. special coordinator ...beyond the economic
functional area to which he was charged."
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to alter these terms of reference, including
the involvement of the United Nations in the negotiating
process, are unacceptable to the government of Israel," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the basis of the Arab-Israeli peace process
since the 1991 Madrid Peace Conference had been "direct,
face-to-face negotiations between the parties."
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the United Nations Security Council, Annan said
Roed-Larsen's duties as the new U.N. special coordinator "take
into account recent encouraging developments in the Middle East
peace process," particularly the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations and the prospects for renewed talks in other
bilateral tracks.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Chief said Roed-Larsen would have the task of making
"appropriate preparations within the United Nations for enhancing
U.N. development assistance in support of the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The new special coordinator will also represent the
Secretary-General in discussions with the parties and the
international community "in all matters related to continuing
United Nations support to the peace process," said Annan.
</P>
<P>
Roed-Larsen would take up his new post on October 1, 1999,
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Roed-Larsen served as the first U.N. special coordinator in
the occupied territories from June 1994 to October 1996.

<HEADLINE> CPC Mouthpiece Hails Deepening of SOE Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The decision by the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) on the reform of
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has profound timely and historical
significance, says a People's Daily editorial to be published on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Marking the conclusion of the 4th Plenum of the 15th CPC
Central Committee, the editorial urges that a new door be opened
for the reform and development of the SOEs.
</P>
<P>
It notes that on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the
founding of new China, the CPC Central Committee Decision on
Issues Related to State-Owned Enterprise Reforms and Development
won the approval of the plenum participants. Jiang Zemin, general
secretary of the CPC Central Committee, made an important speech
at the plenum, which was the first special meeting held by the CPC
Central Committee to study reforms and development of the SOEs.
</P>
<P>
The decision summarizes experience with SOE development over
the past two decades and defines guidelines and major policies and
measures for reforms and growth of the state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is an important milestone in the history of both
the development of SOEs and the economic development of our
country," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
It points out that SOEs have always played a very important
role in China's economic and social development. It says that
invigoration of the SOEs is both a crucial economic issue in
regard to the health and long-term growth of the national economy
and a crucial political issue in terms of the fate of the
socialist system.
</P>
<P>
At a time when international political and economic situation
is unstable, sciences and technology are advancing rapidly and
international competition is intensifying, national power has
become the key element of a country's future, it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that the SOEs are the major pillars of the
economy and major forces in the modernization drive of the country.
Therefore, to enlarge China's economic and defense capabilities
and reinforce the unity of the people, the state-owned sector
should always be expanding and growing stronger.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Govt Says Enjoying Good Ties With Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
Wednesday said it enjoys complete harmony with the country's
powerful armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"There is complete harmony and cooperation between all the
sections of the government of Pakistan including all of its
civilian and non-civilian components," Pakistani Information
Minister Mushahid Hussain told newsmen after a cabinet meeting
chaired by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a recent warning of U.S. State Department against
any "extra constitutional means to topple a government," Mushahid
said it was in response to Pakistani opposition leaders who have
been crawling and cringing towards Washington to destabilize a
constitutionally-elected government.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the opposition for urging the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to cut off its financial assistance to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came after a recent statement of Imran Khan, leader
of Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf, which called for the suspension of IMF
aid to Pakistan to "punish Nawaz Sharif for his dictatorial style
of government."
</P>
<P>
"Seeking self-reliance is different from seeking stoppage of
aid under already signed agreements," Hussain said.

<HEADLINE> CPC Mouthpiece Hails Deepening of SOE Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It points out that pushing forward reforms and development of
the SOEs is an important task for the CPC and a honorable mission
for the current generation.
</P>
<P>
It notes that the CPC Central Committee's decision has set the
goals for the SOE reforms in the years to come. The decision also
puts forward ten guidelines for the reforms and development. The
decision particularly emphasizes that the CPC's leadership over
the SOE reforms must be strengthened, which requires fostering a
high-quality management team.
</P>
<P>
In order to implement the spirit of the plenum of the CPC
Central Committee, the editorial calls for all the CPC members,
especially party leaders, to earnestly study the decision. It also
calls for officials at all levels to work diligently to find
solutions for major problems in the SOE reforms.
</P>
<P>
"We will by no means pursue privatization," it says, stressing
that the SOE reforms must stick to the basic economic system with
public ownership as the main form of ownership and other forms of
ownership developing simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
It says that reform and development of the SOEs essentially
means that continuous improvements must be made in the state-owned
sector, which should have increased presence and power of control
in a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
It notes that the plenum of the CPC Central Committee has set
the year 2010 as the target for SOEs. This is a practical and
scientific choice based on the correct assessment of the situation
of SOE reforms. It asks officials to combine short-term goals with
long-term goals during the process of the SOE reform.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says good opportunities exist now for reforms and
development of the SOEs. "We will surely create a new situation of
reforms and development of the SOEs if we earnestly implement the
spirit of the 15th CPC National Congress and the 4th Plenum of the
15th CPC Central Committee," it says.

He also called on African countries to put in place mechanism

<P>
Such a measure was imperative in those areas prone to both
natural and man-made disasters such as drought, floods and civil
conflicts, said Samba.

from Iran, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
After a brief interrogation at the airport, police released
Abu Marzuk who holds a Yemeni passport, but denied his
entry into Jordan and asked him to "leave the country for
any destination he wishes".
</P>
<P>
The other two men, who are Jordanian citizens, faced charges of
engaging in illegal political activities in the kingdom and a
possible one-year prison term if convicted under the Jordanian
law.
</P>
<P>
The move is apparently another step by Jordanian authorities
to crack down on the Hamas movement after police shut down the
Hamas office in Amman and arrested 12 of its members on August 30.
</P>
<P>
Police also issued arrest warrants against Hamas spokesman
Ibrahim Ghosheh, former politburo chief Abu Marzuk, current leader
of the movement`s politburo Khaled Mashaal and Hamas representative
in Jordan Mohammad Nazzal, who were then on a visit to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The whereabout of Mohammad Nazzal is not immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
Hamas is known as a militant Palestinian organization which
opposes the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians and
stands for a "holy war" to liberate all Palestinians territories
to establish an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is a staunch supporter of the Palestinians but called
for an early resumption of peace talks between Israel and the
Palestinians as well as Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, becoming
the second Arab country after Egypt to strike a peace deal
with the Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Saudis to Back Possible Arab Boycott of Disney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia said on
Wednesday it will support any possible Arab League boycott of the
U.S. entertainment giant Walt Disney Corporation over an
exhibition dispute.
</P>
<P>
"Saudi Arabia is committed to back moves by the Arab League," a
Saudi spokesman told the official Saudi Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the Gulf kingdom would stand behind any move to be
adopted by the Arab foreign ministers during their consultative
meeting due in New York on Friday on the sidelines of the annual
United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
One of Disney's exhibit in the millennium exhibition, due to
open on September 30 at the company's Epcot Center in Orlando,
Florida, depicts Jerusalem as Israel's capital, which has become
the center of a row between Disney and Arab-Islamic countries
recently.
</P>
<P>
Israel regards the whole Jerusalem as its "eternal and
indivisible capital" while the Palestinians want Arab East
Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, to be
capital of the future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi spokesman said the Cairo-based Arab League previously
decided to contact Disney over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Disney has explained to Arab states that it will go ahead with
the Israeli exhibit, but it will not depict occupied Jerusalem as
Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
However, the explanations are considered as "not convincing"
and several Arab states have threatened to boycott Disney's
products and service unless the company met the demands of Arab
states.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem has always been one of the most sensitive issues
between the Palestinians and the Israelis.

<HEADLINE> China Beat South Korea at Asian Women's Volleyball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese women spikers
Wednesday vanquished their arch-rivals South Korea in full sets,
booking their berth in the four-team finals with a clean slate at
the Asian Women's Volleyball Championship here.
</P>
<P>
"Our team are young, they are a little bit nervous in the court,
" said Chinese coach Hu Jin who took charge of the national team
again in March.
</P>
<P>
He added that he was "very satisfied" with his team and
believed that they could perform better if they took the advantage
at the net.
</P>
<P>
The win put world and Olympic runners-up China not only into
the round-robin finals, but also into an advantage to defend the
title seven times in a row because the Chinese win over South
Korea will be carried into the finals.
</P>
<P>
The finals will pick up top two finishers of the two groups.
South Korea secured the finals berth on Tuesday with three wins
and one loss in Group B while Japan and Thailand ranked top two in
Group A.
</P>
<P>
In Wednesday's other matches, Japan defeated Chinese Taipei 3-0
and remained undefeated in three matches of Group A and Thailand
outclassed lowly-rated hosts Hong Kong, China 3-0 to finish second
in the group with two wins and one loss.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the match against South Korea, Hu Jin said: "I'm
quite happy with my team's performance today."
</P>
<P>
South Korean coach Kim Cheol Yong said he would not wait long
before taking a revenge.
</P>
<P>
"But I am still confident that my team will beat China sooner
or later," said Kim Cheol Yong, who re-coached South Korea's
national team early this year after South Korea suffered a loss to
China in the finals at the Asian Games last year.
</P>
<P>
Kim led South Korea's surprise victory over China, taking the
gold in Hiroshima Asian Games in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The clash between China and South Korea was regarded as the
title's fight in advance.
</P>
<P>
Local crowd favorites China got a slow start when they left
behind 0-4. But they soon controlled the game and led the score
all the way up to 24-20 with powerful serving and tight blocking.
</P>
<P>
But the fighting Koreans came from behind to level the score at
24-all by saving four set points. Then the game was tied 5 times
before China sealed the tough set due to their opponents' erratic
smashes.
</P>
<P>
The second and third sets saw the Koreans dominating the net
and displaying solid defense, winning the two sets 25-19, 25-21.
</P>
<P>
The fourth set was a see-saw affair and the scores were leveled
12 times before China took the set at 25-23.
</P>
<P>
Koreans raced to a lead at 12-9 in the decider. Then China
fought back to tie at 12-all. And the game was the repeat of the
first set, leveling eight times in a row before China finished the
125-minute tussle with a score of 22-20.

<HEADLINE> Measures Announced to Boost Competitiveness of HK Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The landing and parking
charges for all aircraft at the Hong Kong International Airport
are proposed to be reduced by 15 percent with effect from January
1, 2000, Victor Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Airport Authority,
announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the measures announced by Fung for increasing
the competitive edge of the Hong Kong International Airport.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include invitation for expressions of interest
for the construction of logistics centers at the airport and
invitation for expressions of interest for the construction of a
marine cargo terminal at the airport.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the reduction in charges will provide a timely
incentive to the development of aviation into Hong Kong and to the
highly competitive and price-sensitive air freight market in
particular," Fung said.
</P>
<P>
"Taken as a whole, the three measures will allow Hong Kong to
further strengthen its position as the airfreight hub of Asia," he
added. The Hong Kong International Airport is number one in the
world in international air cargo and number five in international
passengers.
</P>
<P>
Fung added that the reduction in charges would also enable the
airlines to offer more competitive, value-added services, and in
particular that they would bring in additional passenger traffic
and to develop new routes into Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that the airlines would pass on a substantial
portion of these reductions to benefit local residents and
visitors alike, and should provide a welcome boost to the tourist
industry.
</P>
<P>
The logistics center will provide state-of-the-art facilities
for automated storage, customizing and retrieval systems. The
marine cargo terminal will handle air cargo arriving by sea from
the Pearl River Delta in southern China.
</P>
<P>
Fung said that the reduction in charges would be subject to
approval by the Chief Executive in Council, and will be reviewed
annually.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government expressed its welcome to the measures
on Wednesday, saying that these measures will help enhance Hong
Kong's position as a major air cargo hub and will also benefit
Hong Kong's traders, transport operators and the air cargo
industry.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Airlines Representatives, which represents all
airlines operating at Hong Kong International Airport, and the
Hong Kong Tourist Association have also expressed their welcome to
the measures.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopes Cyprus Peace Talks to Start Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States is hopeful
that talks over the Cyprus issue will take place in the near
future, the U.S. ambassador in Nicosia Donald Bandler said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Cyprus' Socialist Edek Party
leader Vassos Lyssarides, Bandler said what is important is "to
begin the comprehensive talks" and that it doesn't matter whether
the talks begin "indirectly, directly or some other combination."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the international community has been trying to
bring the two sides to negotiate for reunification through a
bicommunal settlement. But no tangible progress has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
The seven most industrialized nations plus Russia (G-8), in
their June summit in Cologne, Germany, asked the United Nations
Secretary General Kofi Annan to invite leaders of the two
communities to unconditional negotiations in the fall of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides has said he expects to be
invited to talks in the second half of October.
</P>
<P>
However, the prospect of holding such meetings remains gloomy
as Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash insists that he would not
enter into negotiations unless his breakaway state in northern
Cyprus, backed by Turkey, be internationally recognized and talk
with Nicosia on equal basis.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the current situation, Lyssarides said he did not
believe peace talks, even if possible now, would yield any better
results than previous attempts.
</P>
<P>
"I do not see any change in Turkey's positions and therefore I
do not expect that it is possible to get better results from this
round of negotiations," he said.

NEW DELHI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee Wednesday said India was ready to hold talks with
Pakistan in a positive and peaceful atmosphere but warned against
any misadventure along the border.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to hold dialogue for peace with Islamabad if a
conducive atmosphere is created for it," he told a heavily
attended election campaign rally in Barh of Bihar state.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want war, but we won whenever it was thrust on us by
Pakistan," he said, adding any misadventure on India's border
would be firmly dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Indicating that Pakistan was once again planning to rake up
Kashmir issue at several international fora, he said, "India is
firm on its stand that Kashmir is an integral part of the country
and we will in no circumstances compromise on this issue."

DHAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP)-led opposition alliance has called for a dawn-to-dusk
hartal (general strike) on October 3 to protest at the

their participation and to demand a fresh voter list.
</P>

The call for the nationwide hartal was made during separate

Solidarity Front).
</P>
<P>
The opposition also demanded cancellation of the "fake" voter
identity cards as well as resignation of the government.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Reduce Military Force in Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- NATO defense ministers agreed
to streamline their military operations in the Balkans by cutting
the number of troops in Bosnia by one-third and reorganizing those
remaining into a more cost-effective force.
</P>
<P>
At a two-day informal meeting of defense ministers and generals
from the 19 NATO nations, Javier Solana, NATO's secretary-general,
said on Tuesday that a cut in peacekeeping forces in the Balkans
is possible due to the improved security situation in Bosnia and
the demilitarization of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
"We have analyzed the situation in Bosnia and it is true that
the situation today permits a rationalization of the deployment of
the force which is on the ground," Solana said.
</P>
<P>
Formal approval of the plan is expected later this fall.
</P>
<P>
Solana said this might mean combining NATO forces in the region
into a single Balkans command, although merging the forces
completely would not be possible because the two conflicts are
quite different, with a peace agreement in Bosnia but no such deal
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO countries now have 80,000 peacekeeping troops deployed in
five Balkan states including Bosnia, Croatia, Macedonia, Albania
and the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan tentatively agreed to by the allies, a strong
presence would remain in Kosovo to guard the fragile peace, but
the number of troops in Bosnia would be reduced to 21,000, from
the current 30,000, over the winter and the forces would be
reorganized to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
The discussions on Tuesday in Toronto were the first since the
war with Yugoslavia and were understandably focused on the Balkans.
A post-mortem of the NATO intervention in Kosovo was a key item on
the agenda.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Nosedive in Tokyo as BOJ Maintains Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices plunged in Tokyo
Wednesday as investors rushed to sell stocks after the Bank of
Japan (BOJ), contrary to market expectations, refused Thursday to
ease its monetary grip further.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange tumbled 607.03 points, or 3.39
percent from Tuesday's close to end at 17,325.76. The decline is
the largest single day's loss so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, lost 50.05 points or 3.27 percent to 1,479.
28.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to 590.65 million shares
from 561.77 million shares Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
The BOJ announced Tuesday after the stock market closed its
decision to leave its monetary policy unchanged, although market
players had expected monetary easing to prevent the yen from
rising further.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's unexpected decision led the U.S. dollar to
as low as 103.78 yen at one stage in New York on Tuesday. The
dollar's fall stirred stock selling, leading both the Dow Jones
Industrial Average and the technology-heavy NASDAQ composite index
sharply lower, traders said.
</P>
<P>
share prices were lower in most business sectors in Tokyo, and
export-oriented technology issues faced strong selling.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers far
outnumbered gainers 1,044 to 206, with 91 issues remaining
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the U.S. dollar fell against the
yen, on selling by Japanese institutional investors and U.S. hedge
funds.
</P>
<P>
At 5 p.m., the dollar was quoted at 104.27-30 yen, down from
105.22-25 yen at 9 a.m., and from 104.80-90 yen in New York
overnight. The U.S. currency was traded at 105.40-45 yen in Tokyo
late Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Rejects Draft Constitutional Amendments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma failed
Wednesday to approve draft constitutional amendments that would
require the Lower House of parliament's consent for presidential
appointments or dismissals of the prime minister, his deputies and
seven key ministers.
</P>
<P>
Only 221 deputies voted in favor of the draft, 79 less than
the 300 votes required for its passage in the first reading.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin's representative in the Lower House,
Alexander Kotenkov, opposed the amendments, saying they fail to
foresee a situation if the Duma refuses to endorse a dismissal of
the prime minister and other key ministers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the new measures would make government ministers
dependent on parliament, Kotenkov said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Denies Reports to Better Ties With Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece denied Wednesday that
Foreign Minister George Papandreou had ever raised an issue of
improving relations with Turkey without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that there was a climate of non-tension,
referring to the present state of Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that a second round of talks between senior
Greek-Turkish Foreign Ministry officials on finding common ground
for rapprochement had ended and that a third round of such talks
would begin at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
As for Turkey's accession to the European Union (EU), the
spokesman stressed that the neighboring country must show such
behavior which would illustrate that it was coming into line with
European interests.
</P>
<P>
Greece has insisted that Turkey can not join the EU unless
Ankara improves its human rights record and its relations with
Athens.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at odds for
decades over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space

the aim of creating a favorable climate for the improvement of
their strained relations.

<HEADLINE> "Principle of Sovereignty Must be Upheld," Italy Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini said here Wednesday that "the principle of
sovereignty must be upheld," and the case of Kosovo can not be
repeated in the future.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister told a press conference that "the
intervention in Kosovo took place without the mandate by the
United Nations," thus raising an issue of legitimacy in
humanitarian interventions.
</P>
<P>
On the case of Kosovo, a Yugoslav province, he said that the
international community can not take the law into its hand by
waging intervention in a sovereign country under the pretext of
the urgency of the situation in the target country.
</P>
<P>
"This one can not be repeated," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO, without the authorisation of the Security
Council, launched a unilateral military action against Yugoslavia,
a sovereign and independent member of the U.N. family. Under the
U.N. Charter, the Security Council has the primary responsibility
for the maintenance of the world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
In the future, "we should enhance crisis prevention rather than
conflict suppression," and "we should only use force as a last
resort."
</P>
<P>
On the reform of the Security Council, he said the reform drive
is "to make it more democratic and more representative in its
composition."
</P>
<P>
Italy, who has been seeking a membership at the Security
Council, is bidding a seat at the 15-nation body between 2001 and
2002.
</P>
<P>
"Italy is the fifth largest contributor to the U.N. budget, and
is the sixth largest contributor in terms of manpower for the U.N.
peacekeeping mission," he said. "It is sufficient for Italy from
time to time to have a seat at the Council."

<P>
NEW DELHI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- India said Wednesday it
expects Pakistan to prevent any intended crossing of the Line of
Control (LoC) or the International Border in Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
In the context of reports appearing in the Pakistani press
regarding the intention of the so-called Jammu and Kashmir
Liberation Front to cross the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir, Deputy
High Commissioner of Pakistan Akbar Zeb was summoned to the
Ministry of External Affairs Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A foreign office spokesman said that the Pakistani envoy was
asked to convey to his government "their clear obligation for
ensuring the inviolability and sanctity of the LoC, which is
crucial for the maintenance of tranquillity and security."
</P>
<P>
He was also told that Pakistan would be responsible for any
consequences which might result from its failure to do so.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Prepared for Ground Operation in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops are
prepared for a ground operation in Chechnya, but it hardly makes
sense at the moment, Deputy Interior Minister Igor Zubov said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If a political decision for a ground operation is made, the
troops are ready to carry it out, the Interfax news agency quoted
Zubov as saying at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Following a series of deadly bombings that killed more than
300 people in Moscow and other parts of Russia and a recent
incursion of Chechen-based Islamic rebels into the southern region
of Daghestan, authorities have decided to set up a "sanitary
cordon" along the 540-kilometer border with Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"It does not make sense to engage in a military action in the
Chechen territory. A mass intervention deep into the Chechen
republic is unfeasible," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The federal center has no plans for a mass intrusion deep
into the Chechen Republic, capturing Grozny, ousting the current
government or replacing it with a new one," Zubov said. "Such an
operation would entail numerous casualties and is hardly viable."
</P>
<P>
Zubov's remarks followed a series of media reports alleging
that the Russian military, with up to 50,000 troops on the border
with Chechnya, were planning a large scale onslaught on the region,
similar to an ill-fated operation in 1994-96 in which tens of
thousands of people died.
</P>
<P>
He described as optimal the current tactic of no direct
contact.
</P>
<P>
Federal troops will continue sealing off borders and
delivering airstrikes, including "reprisal strikes" against
militant bases, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, federal planes and artillery pounded several
Chechen rebel positions in the Argun Gorge west of Kizler,
southwest of Botlikh, and near the village of Dubovskaya, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 rebels, 15 pieces of military hardware and two
arms and ammunition depots were eliminated in the raids. Federal
troops also destroyed a bridge across the Argun River to stop the
movement of rebel formations.
</P>
<P>
Zubov said the militants receive considerable foreign support
in money and mercenaries.

<HEADLINE> Gold, Silver Prices Shoot Up in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Gold and silver prices rose

per ten grams and silver rallying by 105 rupees (2.44 U.S.
dollars) per kilogram.
</P>
<P>

last close of 4,050 rupees (94.19 U.S. dollars). 22-carat gold

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ready silver (.999 fineness) opened firm at 8,125

<HEADLINE> Global Fund on Energy Resources, Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- An international network of
non- governmental organizations, EarthAction, Wednesday called for
the creation of a global fund to finance renewable energy and the
protection of forests in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
EarthAction's international coordinator Nicholas Dunlop said
that the creation of the fund would enable developing nations to
adopt more environmentally-friendly renewable and low-carbon
energy sources such as solar and wind power to help reduce the
effects of global warming.
</P>
<P>
He said the emissions of greenhouse gases caused mainly by
burning fossil fuel, used mainly in developing countries, had
caused the atmosphere to heat more rapidly.
</P>
<P>
"Not only it is time to confront global warming head-on, it is
also time we realize that the transition to renewable energy such
as solar and wind power will create more jobs and improve our
health by giving us cleaner air, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Dunlop said one possible funding source could be a levy of a
quarter of a cent per U.S. dollar on all international currency
transactions, which if effected would generate about 200 billion
U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
"Also governments should redirect their support currently given
for fossil fuels to renewable energy and to retrain oil and coal
workers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gas emissions would increase by 30 percent by year 2012 because
of the prevalence of fossil fuel use in most developing countries
in Africa and Latin America, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fossil fuel use in most African countries had contributed to
the depletion of forests which researchers said were losing at a
rate of 3.6 million hectares a year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Top Legislator Urges ASEAN Members to Enhance Inter-Parliamentary Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Senate President
Blas Ople has stressed the need for stronger bonds among the
parliaments and other lawmaking bodies of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Philippine News Agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ople made the call in a speech during a dinner Tuesday at the
Manila Hotel in honor of delegates to the 20th General Assembly of
the ASEAN Inter-Parliamentary Organization (AIPO).
</P>
<P>
Earlier, in an address at the opening of the AIPO meeting last
Sunday, Ople cited the need for building strong national and
regional institutions, suggesting that the latter could help pave
the way for the setting up of an ASEAN Parliament.
</P>
<P>
"In the pursuit of self-sustaining economic growth and
stability, the values of liberty, as expressed in accountability
and transparency, are important," Ople said.
</P>
<P>
He said the principles of accountability and transparency are
best exercised through parliamentary institutions which is why
Southeast Asia needs strong parliamentary institutions.
</P>
<P>
"ASEAN needs a strong AIPO, and we need to support each other
strongly," he added.
</P>
<P>
AIPO's general assembly is composed of members of the
legislatures of ASEAN member countries. Its incumbent president is
Philippine House Speaker Manny Villar.
</P>
<P>
Attending the AIPO meeting at the Manila Hotel are 230
delegates from eight member countries, two permanent observer
countries and seven observer nations.
</P>
<P>
The assembly has just approved resolutions seeking to promote
greater regional peace and stability, speedier economic recovery,
intensified anti-drug and transnational crime prevention and
greater protection of women, children and the environment.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Should Play Greater Role in China: President  Jiang (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has said that the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) should and is fully capable of playing a
greater role in the affairs of the nation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in a speech today at a meeting marking
the 50th anniversary of the founding of the CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
Senior Chinese leader Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu
Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing took part in this afternoon's
meeting.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jiang recalled the establishment of the CPPCC
and its contribution to the founding of the People's Republic of
China, the post-war economic recovery, as well as the reform and
opening up in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that "the CPPCC is a great innovation of the
Chinese Communist Party which integrates Marxist-Leninist theory
on the united front with China's actual conditions."
</P>
<P>
As an institution of democratic consultation and an
organization of the united front, Jiang said "the CPPCC has played
and will continue to play an important role in China's political,
economic and cultural activities."
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that "upholding the leadership of the
Chinese Communist Party is a fundamental guarantee for success in
efforts to consolidate and develop the patriotic united front and
is the primary political prerequisite for success in China's
multiparty cooperation."
</P>
<P>
"In handling relations between the Chinese Communist Party and
the democratic parties, we shall continue to follow the principle
of long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, sincere treatment in
dealings with each other and the sharing of weal or woe," Jiang
said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Signs Cleaner Production Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has made a commitment
to environmental protection by signing the International
Declaration on Cleaner Production of the United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP), the Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Minister of Science, Technology and Environment Chu
Tuan Nha signed the convention here Wednesday in the witness of
UNEP Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific Nirmal Andrews.
</P>
<P>
The convention, which was formulated by UNEP and made public at
its fifth international seminar in the Republic of Korea last
year, aims to raise awareness of the urgency of current
environmental problems and the concept of a preventive strategy as
a preferred solution.
</P>
<P>
The convention also seeks to renew and intensify the commitment
to cleaner production by society and community leaders, and
promote further international cooperation and technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, the VNA said, has always attached importance to
environmental protection and sustainable development. Vietnam's
National Assembly adopted a law on environmental protection in
December 1993, and the Vietnamese government has issued a series
of legal documents to guide economic development along the
direction of rational use of natural resources and protection of
the environment.

<HEADLINE> "Fifty Years of New China's Journalism" Symposium Held in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A symposium on the "Fifty
Years of New China's Journalism" was held here today by the All-
China Journalists Association to mark the 50th anniversary of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Executive vice president of the association, Zheng Mengxiong
said, the journalism of New China is an important part of the
course of socialism with Chinese characteristics headed by the
Communist Party of China (CPC). All the media are not only the
voice and eye of the Party, the central government and the people,
but also have become an information industry which has influenced
the development of China.
</P>
<P>
New China's journalism has gone through three phases of
development, he said. The first period started with the founding
of New China in 1949 and ended in 1966, when the Cultural
Revolution began. During those years, the former media system was
overhauled to make way for a new form of socialist journalism.
</P>
<P>
During the second phase (1966-78), the journalism in China
suffered great damage, especially in the field of domestic news
for overseas services.
</P>
<P>
The third phase began in December, 1978, when the Third Plenary
Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
Party was held. It is a time of rapid development for the country'
s journalism.
</P>
<P>
Zheng noted the five characteristics of the third phase:
</P>
<P>
-- The guiding principle has shifted from coverage of "class
struggles" to that of economic construction and reform and opening-
up;
</P>
<P>
-- The practice and theory of overseas forms of journalism have
been absorbed, and a theory of socialist journalism with Chinese
characteristics developed;
</P>
<P>
-- Regulations and laws on journalism have ensured its healthy
development;
</P>
<P>
-- The application of advanced technology has quickened its
development, and
</P>
<P>
-- The media information industry has become a new growth point
of China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Facing the challenge of the coming new century, all the media
and journalists will continue to develop the country's journalism
and contribute to the construction of a prosperous, powerful and
democratic socialist China, Zheng said.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people were
killed and 34 others wounded when a luxury bus and a lorry
collided on the N1 highway in Western Cape Province in the early
hours of Wednesday, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from the scene of the accident, police spokesman
Captain Eddie Cronje said that eight passengers on the bus as well
as the two occupants of the lorry were killed instantly when the
bus traveling with 39 passengers and a crew of four from Durban to
Cape Town collided with a lorry traveling in the opposite
direction around 2:45 a.m. (00:45 GMT).
</P>
<P>
One of the seriously injured bus passengers died later in
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Cronje said that eight people were seriously injured and 26 had
minor injuries or were suffering from shock. They were taken to
hospitals in nearby towns. The two Intercape Mainliner bus
drivers are among the injured.
</P>
<P>
One woman passenger, who has internal injuries, was later
transferred to a Cape Town hospital.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman for Intercape Mainliner Jackie McEwan said that
according to statements taken from the stewardess on the bus as
well as passengers, it appeared the truck veered across the road
into oncoming traffic.
</P>
<P>
"The Intercape bus swerved to avoid a head-on collision and the
two vehicles collided on the left side," said the police officer.
</P>
<P>
Cronje said the front end of the lorry was completely smashed
while the left side of the bus was also badly damaged.
</P>
<P>
The N1 between Laingsburg and Touws River has become known as
the "death strip" due to the large number of accidents on the
road.

people at home and abroad as possible who love China to bring
about the complete reunification of the motherland and the
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his conviction that "the CPPCC will make even

prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced socialist and
modern China."

cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the
Communist Party.

socialist democracy and plays an indispensable role in China's
political, economic and social life," Li said.

in China, reflects the superiority of our political system, and is
a trait which represents a strong point in China's socialist
democracy," he continued.

<P>
Li noted that "the CPPCC is attracting greater and greater
attention from our Party, the state and the people of all sectors
of society."

expectations of the state, never bringing disgrace to its mission.

<HEADLINE> India: Pak Move on Aircraft Issue "Entirely Untenable" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- India said Wednesday
Pakistan's move to seek compensation for the shooting down of its
naval aircraft at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is
"entirely untenable."
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman said, "It is a desperate propaganda
gimmick timed to coincide with the opening of the U.N. General
Assembly in New York," adding that India will deal with it as
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that the Pakistani aircraft was on a
hostile military mission and was engaged in espionage activity and
committed a brazen violation of India's air space.
</P>
<P>
It had also violated the 1991 agreement between the two
countries on prevention of air space violations as well as
internationally accepted rules of engagement in such situations.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, which has filed a case with the ICJ, has sought
compensation of 60.2 million U.S. dollars from India for the
downing of the aircraft on August 10, killing 16 navy personnel.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Senate Leader Resorts to Interpol to Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Senate President Evan
Enwerem has offered to submit his legal practitioner certificate
to the International Police for verification in a bid to dispel
accusation against him on falsification.
</P>
<P>
The leader of Nigeria's upper chamber of top legislature said
through his spokesman in Abuja Tuesday that the verification will
show "indeed Enwerem passed his exams for call to the English bar"
and got the document necessary to start a solicitor practice in
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Senate president hurried back to his home country without
attending the ceremony of call to English bar, Nigeria's major
newspaper Daily Times Wednesday quoted his spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
But this does not mean he did not get the qualification of it,
his spokesman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The Tell, a Lagos-based magazine, claimed in its latest issue
that Enwerem had actually forged the certificate and did not have
the qualification to start a legal practice when he came back from
Britain in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The Senate president's spokesman also accused the magazine of
making " unlimited lies" against the third person in the country's
political hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
Enwerem has long been a target of media attacks since the
scandal of former House Speaker Ibrahim Buhari, who resigned and
was fined later due to forgery and perjury on his age and
education diploma.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the scandal of Buhari, Enwerem was accused in
July this year by the same magazine Tell of trying to cover his
conviction of stealing in 1945 while serving as a clerk in the
British colonial administration.
</P>
<P>
But this charge was later cleared by the investigation panel of
Nigeria' s top legislature.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Teachers Agree in Principle to End Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's university teachers
have agreed in principle to end their nationwide strike in return
for a concession by officials to persuade the federal government
to give them an " academic allowance".
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday that the teachers
agreed in a communique Tuesday to "take necessary steps" towards
ending the strike which has lasted for nine days, to pave the way
for further discussions on outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
They did not say when exactly they would return to their duty
post.
</P>
<P>
Following hours of negotiations in Abuja Tuesday with
representatives of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, the
government negotiation team announced in the communique that it
would persuade President Olusegun Obasanjo to implement the
"academic allowance."
</P>
<P>
Both parties have agreed that the purported May 25, 1998
agreement on which the union declared a trade dispute, never got
the approval of the former Head of State General Abdulsalam
Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
It was also not reflected as the outstanding commitment of the
government in the hand-over notes received by Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the review of other allowances
would commence without delay to ensure that they are accommodated
in next year's budget.
</P>
<P>
However, the teachers union was asked to note that whereas its
members in state universities are also involved in the on-going
strike, "the federal government team cannot make commitments on
behalf of state governments."
</P>
<P>
It further stated that the on-going trade dispute declared by
the union undermined the government's "serious" concern to
implement far-reaching programs to revitalize tertiary
institutions in the country.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the current negotiation "will
certainly go beyond the issue of staff welfare and allowances,
and will address other aspects of the problems of higher
institutions in the country and those of other unions with similar
interests."
</P>
<P>
The Academic Staff Union of Universities embarked on a strike
action last Monday, insisting that the federal government must
implement the agreement that it allegedly had reached with the
former military administration.
</P>
<P>
The agreement in question was to specifically increase the
allowances of university teachers by two billion naira (one U.S.
dollar equals some 100 naira), made up of 500-million-naira
academic allowances and 1.5-billion- naira recoverable loans to
both academic and non-academic staff.

with China and was ready to push forward their growth.
</P>
<P>

attention to China's development for years. He also expressed his
admiration for China's achievements made during the reform and
opening-up, and wished China will score even greater achievements
in economic construction.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Falls in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The surplus plunged to 689.4 billion yen (5.9 billion dollars)
as a stronger yen held back exports, the ministry said in a
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Exports dropped 6.9 percent to 3,736.7 billion yen (32.2
billion dollars), as the yen's value was steeply higher in terms
of the U.S. dollar than a year before.
</P>
<P>
The stronger yen propelled shipments of steel, office equipment
and automobiles to contract by 25.1 percent, 16.4 percent and 6.9
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Imports also retreated 2.4 percent to 3,047.3 billion yen (26.3
billion dollars), with imports of aircraft and coal down 66.3
percent and 28.0 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Japan's merchandise trade balance is measured on the basis of
goods clearing customs and is reported before adjustment for
seasonal factors.
</P>
<P>
The yen traded at an average of 115.91 yen in August, a 23.8
percent rise from the 143.48 yen a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United
States climbed 24.3 percent to 534.4 billion yen (4.6 billion

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal planes and
artillery delivered strikes on Chechen rebels Tuesday, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Rebels "suffered serious losses" in the raids on positions in
the Argun Gorge west of Kizlyar, southwest of Botlikh, and near
the village of Dubovskaya, Interfax said, quoting regional
headquarters for federal troops in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 rebels, 15 pieces of military hardware, and two
arms and ammunition depots were eliminated. Federal planes also
destroyed a bridge across the Argun River to prevent the movement
of rebel formations, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian federal units in Daghestan continue to
strengthen their defense system along the administrative border
with Chechnya amid reports that Chechen rebels are planning new
incursions into the southern republic.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have launched two waves of assaults on Daghestan
from the breakaway province Chechnya since early August. In both
cases, they were driven out by federal troops and local forces.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Interior Ministry said Wednesday that search
investigation operations continue in Daghestan's Buinaksk district,
where policemen, interior troops and volunteers are carrying out
mop-up operations in the forests and mountain slopes near the
villages of Chabanmakhi and Karamakhi, and along various possible
retreat routes of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, the Russian Defense Ministry
said Wednesday that a visit by Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev to
Switzerland, scheduled for September 23-25, has been canceled as
the result of a "difficult political situation in the country and
the continuing operations of federal troops against illegal armed
groups in the North Caucasus region," the Itar-Tass reported.

<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua)-- The Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the country's major group of
political advisors, has made an important contribution to the
establishment and development of the New China and peaceful
reunification of the motherland, according to Chen Jinyu, the
Deputy Secretary-general of the CPPCC's National Committee.
</P>
<P>
At the first CPPCC Plenary Session, September 21-30, 1949, the
tasks for the founding of the People's Republic of China as the
will of the Chinese people was discussed, with CPPCC exercising
power of the National People's Congress, which had not yet been
established.
</P>
<P>
The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, Organic (organization) Law of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, and the Organic Law of
the Central People's Government were passed.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution of the PRC allows for the system of the multi-
party cooperation and political consultation led by the Communist
Party of China to exist and develop for a long time to come.
Whenever the CPPCC is consulted for decision-making advice or the
implementation of State policies, it holds discussions to listen
to different views to ensure that all State policies and
regulations are complete and sound.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five decades, the CPPCC National Committee
members has made nearly 40,000 proposals, almost half of them
pertaining to economic development, said Chen.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Warns S. Leone Rebels Against Arms Seizure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian-led west African
peace- keeping force ECOMOG has threatened to discard the current
cease-fire regime in Sierra Leone, Nigeria's Guardian newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG said it would do that if the country's former
rebels refuse to return the ammunition they stole from a
contingent of the force.
</P>
<P>
"My troops will violate the cease-fire if our ammunition seized
by rebels are not retrieved within a week," Commander of the
Guinean contingent of the ECOMOG Haji Kante was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG confirmed Tuesday that the Guinean troops were
heading home through rebel-controlled areas when their arms were
seized days ago.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG spokesman Chris Olukolade said that the Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) rebels stole the weapons and temporarily
abducted several Guinean ECOMOG soldiers along the Mange-Kambia
highway, north of the Freetown peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman disclosed that the ECOMOG was in contact with the
RUF leadership and that he hoped the situation could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire was reached in Sierra Leone in May between the S.
Leone government, the ECOMOG force protecting it and the RUF. A
peace accord signed in Togolese capital Lome in July followed the
cease-fire, ending the country's nine-year civil war.

<P>
After China began its reforms and opening up in the late 1970s,
the CPPCC became more active in the country's political life.
CPPCC National Committee members have made suggestions on many
important issues like the Three Gorges Water Control Project,
Shanghai's Pudong New Area, and poverty eradication. In addition
to these political consultations, its functions include
supervising government operations and participating in
deliberations on and the administration of State affairs, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
The reunification of the motherland is another of its key areas.
The CPPCC National Committee has repeatedly announced that it
supports the government's stand on the Taiwan issue and condemns
the separatist remarks and actions of certain people in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC National Committee members in Hong Kong had worked
hard for the return of Hong Kong to the motherland and now those
in Macao are engaged in the return of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC National Committee has increased relations with
institutions elsewhere in the world and established ties with 108
organizations in 72 countries, and 4 international and regional
organizations.

"With the development of the socialist market economy and
socialist democratic politics in China in the next century, the

<HEADLINE> Russia Says Kosovo Protection Corps Attempt to Legalize KLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Wednesday that
the formation of a Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC) with the
functions of an emergency situations organization was a clear
attempt to legalize part of the Kosovo rebels' military formations.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry was in response
to a document on KPC signed in Pristina on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The document, which gives 200 representatives of the Kosovo
Protection Corps the right to hold weapons "for personal security",
was signed by KFOR Commander Michael Jackson, the U.N. secretary-
general's special envoy to Kosovo Bernard Kouchner, and a
representative of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
"Earlier, we stated on many occasions that the preservation of
the inner organizational structure and vertical command of the
Kosovo Albanians' armed units, in whatever form, would be
extremely dangerous and inadmissible," the Interfax news agency
quoted the Russian statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The documents signed in Pristina go against the letter and
spirit of the U.N. Security Council Resolution 1244, under which
the KLA and other paramilitary groups of Kosovo Albanians must be
demilitarized," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also expressed surprise over the name assigned
to the new organization.
</P>
<P>
Moscow also pointed to the fact that no KLA leader has
publicly rejected the plans to "reorganize the KLA into a "regular
" Kosovo armed force."
</P>
<P>
"A step in this particular direction has been made," the
Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Russia called for a full and final demilitarization of the KLA
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"All measures must be taken to involve the former KLA in
peaceful life," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Russia, as an active participant in the Kosovo
settlement, will be unable to take up responsibility for the
possible negative consequences of this thoughtless political act,"
the statement emphasized.

<HEADLINE> 3 Iraqis Start Trip Around World on Foot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Three Iraqis have kicked off
a round-the-world tour on foot to show the Iraqi people's
sufferings caused by the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq more than
nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
The travellers, including Mohammed Hussein ,11, Ali Hussein,
20 and Ahmed Muhiee Abdul-Waheed, 44, started their trek from the
southern Iraqi terminal Um Qasser, the Iraqi News Agency reported
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The trip is aimed at acquainting people around the world with
the blatant crimes committed by the U.S. and British governments
with their daily bombardment of Iraq's civil and service
facilities which had claimed lives of many civilians.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched four-day airstrikes
against Iraq last December, their warplanes have been regularly
attacking Iraqi civil and military targets in the no-fly zones,
causing severe civilian casualties and property damage.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed by the U.S. and Britain with a
claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite
Muslims in the south against possible attacks by Iraqi government
troops.

<P>
It was stressed at the plenum that strengthening and improving
the Party leadership are fundamental guarantees for speeding up
the reforms and development of State-owned enterprises and that
efforts must be made to establish a leading system for the State-
owned enterprises and an organizational and managerial system that
conform to the law of the market economy and China's actual
situation, improve the enterprise leadership, bring into play the
role of the Party organization of enterprises as their political
core, and adhere to the principle of relying on the working class
whole-heartedly. It is imperative to adhere and improve the
democratic management system with the worker representative
congress as the basic form. Efforts should be made to promote the
work of promoting ethical and cultural progress in enterprises and
to improve ideological and political work. Measures must be taken
to build a top-quality managerial team and standardize and improve
the ways of training, promoting, administrating, checking and
examining, and supervising management personnel, and create a
social environment for the healthy growth of the management
personnel and entrepreneurs. Party committees and governments at
all levels should firmly stand at the forefront of the reform,
emancipate their minds, be practical and realistic, start from the
actual situation of the State-owned enterprises of various trades,
unite with and lead the officials and people to press ahead
despite difficulties.
</P>
<P>
It was decided at the plenum that Comrade Hu Jintao was
appointed vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC),

<P>
The plenum held that the effort to improve the balance of debts
and assets and reduce the social burden of State-owned enterprises
need to be combined with that to deepen internal reforms,
establish new mechanisms, and increase scientific management. More
realistic and effective measures need to be found to solve
problems step by step in line with the macro-economic environment,
the State's financial ability and different circumstances, and
these measures should be designed to help State-owned enterprises
increase assets and reduce debts and to help them restructure
assets and debts. The social functions of enterprises need to be
separated and governments at various levels should support it
actively to ensure steady progress. Efforts should be continued to
reduce redundant employees and increase profits of enterprises,
deal with the re-employment of laid-off workers, maintain social
security, provide more opportunities for the jobless, direct
employment ideology, and develop a market-oriented employment
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
It was pointed out at the plenum that technological advancement
and industrial upgrading of State-owned enterprises needs to be
sped up to keep up with global industrial restructuring trends and
changes in domestic and overseas markets. With the market as a
guide, traditional industries need to be transformed with advanced
technology and technical transformation of the existing
enterprises needs to be strengthened with an aim to increase the
varieties of products, improve quality, and increase
profitability and exports. It is imperative that State-owned
enterprises take an important position in rising industries and
high-tech industries, getting hold of the core technologies and
playing a dominant role. Effective policies should be adopted to
ensure more investment in technical renovation in key industries,
key enterprises and key products. Efforts should be made to
establish a new system of technical renovation with enterprises as
its central consideration, promote cooperation between enterprises,
universities and research institutes, and help make research
results profitable. It is imperative to continue macro-economic
control and related reforms, keep a basic balance in the economy,
open the country wider to the outside world, improve the legal
system under the socialist market economy, develop various markets,
maintain economic order, and create a sound environment for the
reforms and development of State-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Somali Refugees Flock to Gulf Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The fierce fightings in
southern Somalia have been seriously felt in the northeastern
region, with refugees continuously storming into the port town of
Bossaso to ride vessels for the Gulf countries.
</P>
<P>
In coping with the new influx of people trying to travel
illegally to the Gulf countries, the Puntland administration has
taken serious measures against those illegal facilitators of the
terribly dangerous adventure to Yemen on boats.
</P>
<P>
In a campaign ordered by the police commissioner of Bossaso,
more than 70 people trying to travel on those illegal boats have
been rounded up in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the administration has
forcefully closed down 12 offices engaged in arranging illegal
trip to the Gulf countries, with five people apprehended and taken
to the police custody.
</P>
<P>
The administration has also caught two of the boats trying to
smuggle the Somali refugees into the Gulf countries through Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Despite the efforts by the Puntland administration against
illegal and dangerous travel, many Somali adventurers still sailed
through the Red Sea towards Yemen.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet known what the Puntland authorities are going to
do about the ordinary citizens who are merely fleeing the
prolonged civil war and droughts.
</P>
<P>
However, the facilitators of the illegal adventure through the
Red Sea together with the navigators of their boats are more
likely to face punitive measures such as fines and imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The police of Bossaso have also foiled attempts of exporting
coal to the Gulf countries on similar boats. Several lorries
transporting the stock towards the ports of Bossaso region have
been halted.
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people are known to have died after those
poorly maintained boats capsized in the middle of the sea in the
past three years.
</P>
<P>
But quite a lot of other people are known to have lost their
lives after the men navigating the boats ordered them to get down
before reaching the Yemen sea-shores for fear of the authorities
there.
</P>
<P>
Most of those resorting to the adventure through Bossaso come
from the war ravaged areas of southern Somalia including
Mogadishu, Bay, Middle and Lower Jubba regions.
</P>
<P>
The minority communities best known as Rer Hamar, Bravana and
Jarer, were those who first opened the way to Saudi Arabia through
Yemen in the early years of the civil war.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Firm Develops Eco-friendly Packaging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli firm affiliated
with the Technion Institute of Technology has developed a cheap
packaging material which self-destructs instead of polluting the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The Haifa-based mini-startup company, called Rademate
Ltd. announced in a press release Wednesday that the company's new
packaging material is as strong and water-resistant as plastic
but completely biodegradable in the ground or at garbage site.
</P>
<P>
The rapid biodegradable hydrophobic material (RBHM) can be
recycled and serve as alternative to plastic trash and it can be
used to coat cellulose-based products, such as paper and
cardboard, making them strong and water-resistant like plastic,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
The material is based on pulp and is combined with polymer
compounds, making the cellulose base behave like a biological
material and decompose due to enzymatic activity in the ground.
</P>
<P>
Unlike plastic, which lasts almost forever, the new material
can be recycled, and whatever is left decomposes in two or three
months at the garbage dump. It is also much cheaper than other
biodegradable material developed by polymer manufactures in the
United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
It can be also manufactured with existing equipment used by
paper and pulp industry, the company added.
</P>
<P>
Among the products for which it can be used are garbage bags,
packaging materials for chemical and fertilizers, disposable pots
and compositing bags, disposable cups and plates and diapers.

<HEADLINE> an epitome of China's achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After his latest trip to that city, he wrote a story about
Shanghai's present mayor Xu Kuangdi, which appeared in Tuesday's "
South China Morning Post," a major English newspaper here.
</P>
<P>
"His focus is to raise the overall quality of life of the
people and the cultural civilization of the city," Sinclair wrote.
</P>
<P>
"Within a short stroll from the imposing granite municipal
headquarters of the City Hall is the splendid opera house, the
magnificent museum, the city planning exhibition hall," he
described the city in his story. "All are new. All are among the
gems -- along with vast sporting stadiums, a glittering convention
center in Pudong, a stunning array of new hotels and an emerging
sophisticated cafe society that make Shanghai with its historic
mystique a booming tourist destination," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
"This is a consequence of his (Xu Kuangdi's) major task of
harmonizing economic development with environmental protection,"
noted Sinclair in his story.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Sinclair met the then Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji, who
later became the premier of China.
</P>
<P>
"What Zhu told me to be done in Shanghai at that time has come
true today," said Sinclair in an exclusive interview with Xinhua
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the story, Sinclair told his readers how Zhu tried his best
to improve the investment environment in Shanghai and to guarantee
that foreign enterprises could do business there in accordance
with international practices.
</P>
<P>
During that trip to Shanghai, Sinclair even went to a number of
toilets in the city to see whether they were as clean as Zhu had
ordered to keep. He found they were all reasonably hygienic.
</P>
<P>
In June 1992, Sinclair became the first foreign reporter to
interview Zhu's successor, Huang Ju.
</P>
<P>
During the lengthy interview, Huang talked about his vision of
a new Shanghai without destroying the old one. "The past (of
Shanghai) will be remembered on one bank of the (Huangpu) river.
The future will rise o the other," Sinclair quoted Huang as saying.
</P>
<P>
The development of Shanghai is only part of the achievements
made in China in the past decades, Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
The reform and opening up policy has been proven successful so
far and it is the right direction for the development of China in
the future, Sinclair commented.
</P>
<P>
Education is one of China's greatest achievements made in the
past 50 years, Kevin Sinclair said, citing the successful
popularization of the common spoken Chinese, Putonghua, in the
whole nation.
</P>
<P>
On another front, Sinclair said that China has fed the biggest
population in the world and has successfully implemented the
policy of family planning, adding that the equality between men
and women in China is also impressive.
</P>
<P>
Having got his permanent identification card of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) shortly after Hong Kong's
handover, Sinclair now considers himself a Hongkonger, and that's
not without a reason.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Sinclair has been working in this city for more than 30
years after he arrived here in 1963 from New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
He and his American wife Kit frequently visit China's mainland.
Kit is an assistant professor of the Hong Kong Polytechnic
University. She also teaches in several universities and colleges
in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair said he writes some 12 stories a week about Hong Kong
and China's mainland, contributing stories to many newspapers and
magazines.
</P>
<P>
Sinclair said that the "village elections" in China have
impressed him very much.
</P>
<P>
"The elections have been successful," he said. "They showed
that people want to have a say in the way they live. " Villagers
could vote back or vote out officials, depending on whether or not
they did a good job for the people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on China's Hong Kong policy, Sinclair said that
China has done everything it promised to do in the agreements of
1984 and later.
</P>
<P>
"I think Hong Kong would have been in a very difficult economic
situation over the past two years without the full backing of the
Chinese government," he said.

<HEADLINE> Multimedia Asia '99 Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Multimedia Asia '99
(MMA '99) opened at the Mines city near here Wednesday with an aim
to promote the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference-cum-exhibition is being attended by
local and foreign figures prominent in the information technology
industry, who had an opportunity to have a dialogue with Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
During the dialogue, Mahathir said developing the agricultural
sector and turning the country into a food producer may be his
next vision for Malaysia after the MSC.
</P>
<P>
The MSC is a 50 by 15 square kilometer zone stretching
southwards from here designated as a hub for the development of
multimedia products and services.
</P>
<P>
As it was, Malaysia was importing too much food items, which
accounted for a large chunk of the country's import bills that
burdened the government especially during the economic downturn,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"My next vision may be more mundane than the previous one but
not less useful...we can't be importing too much food," Mahathir
said when a participant at the Multimedia Asia '99 conference and
exhibition asked him about his new vision.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the MSC, Mahathir said like many other Malaysian
endeavors, the MSC would be successful.
</P>
<P>
The MMA '99, the fourth consecutive one which positions the MSC
as an important hub in the network of dialogue partners, was
themed "Re-aligning for A New Economy" this year.
</P>
<P>
In conjunction with the MMA '99 organized by Malaysia's
National Information Technology Council (NITC) in association with
the Multimedia Development Corporation, an exhibition would be
held at the Mines city from September 23 to 26.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 local and foreign companies are participating in the
exhibition.

BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full
text of a communique from the 4th Plenary Session of the 15th
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Communique of the 4th Plenary Session of the 15th Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China
</P>
<P>
(September 22, 1999)
</P>
<P>
The 4th Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China was held in Beijing, September 19-22,
1999.
</P>
<P>
Attending the plenum were 189 members of the CPC Central
Committee and 147 alternate members of the Central Committee.
Members of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Commission
for Discipline Inspection of the CPC and leading officials of
departments concerned also attended as observers.
</P>
<P>
The session was presided over by the Political Bureau of the
CPC Central Committee. Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC
Central Committee, made an important speech at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Those attending the plenary session discussed and approved the
CPC Central Committee Decision on Issues Related to State-Owned
Enterprise Reforms and Development. The plenum held that pushing
reforms and development of State-owned enterprises forward is an
important and urgent task. State-owned enterprises are a pillar of
the national economy. To fulfill the country's cross-century
development tasks as defined at the 15th Congress of the CPC
Central Committee, establish and develop a socialist market
economic system, and maintain the sustained, rapid, and sound
development of the national economy, it is imperative that the
restructuring of State-owned enterprises, the transforming of
their management, the adjustment of their structure, and the
advancement of their technology be vigorously promoted. The
reforms and development in State-owned enterprises have reached a
crucial stage and some deeply-rooted problems need to be dealt
with. It is therefore a timely and necessary endeavor for the
plenary session to focus on issues related to State-owned
enterprises.

<P>
Those attending the plenary session spoke highly of the role of
State-owned enterprises in the country's economic and social
development and in the socialist system. They reached a consensus
that in the 50 years since the founding of the New China,
especially since the beginning of reforms and opening-up, the
Party has led all nationalities of the country in the unceasing
struggle to turn China from a backward, poor agricultural country
into a socialist one that is becoming a much better-off society
and moving toward the goal of industrialization and modernization.
This is a great historic leap forward in the course of developing
the Chinese nation, and State-owned enterprises and the working
class have made an indelible contribution. To increase the
economic and defense strength and the national cohesion of the
country in the midst of fierce global competition at the turn of
the century, no time can be lost in pushing the restructuring and
development of State-owned enterprises forward and in helping
strengthen the State sector of the economy and allowing it to
assume its major role in the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
Those attending the plenary session decided the major
objectives and guiding principles for the reforms and development
of State-owned enterprises until the year 2010. They emphasized
that, in fulfilling this historic task, every effort must be made
first of all in realizing the three-year goal getting State-owned
enterprises out of difficulties through the reforms. Key sectors,
enterprises, and old industrial centers need to be better managed
in accordance with the realities of different sectors and areas
and the process of unbalanced development, and solutions to major
problems at present need to be combined with long-term development,
and favorable conditions for the development of State-owned
enterprises across the century need to be created.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Shares Dive to Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Shares dived to a
month-low Wednesday as the market sentiment was dampened by the
overnight sharp drop on Wall Street and affected by Bank of
Japan's decision to keep its monetary policy unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) plunged 46.44 points to
end at 2,062.60 points in fairly active dealings.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover increased to 228.57 million units valued at
544.76 million Singapore dollars (about 319.30 million U.S.
dollars). Decliners outstripped advancers by 270 to 43 with 137
counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
AsianMicro topped the volume list as 43.46 million units of the
stock changed hands. Gen Int was the second most heavily traded
share with a turnover of 16.04 million shares. SingTel registered
a volume of 10.59 million counters.
</P>
<P>
YHS led the gainers of the day rising by 30 cents to close at
6.00 Singapore dollars. Seaview moved up 20 cents to finish at
10.80 Singapore dollars. C&AMP;C edged up 15 cents to end at 6.00
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, SPH headed the descent of the day as it
dropped 130 cents to close at 27.70 Singapore dollars. SPH 100
lost 120 cents to finish at 27.60 Singapore dollars. SIA 200 sank
110 cents to end at 16.80 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed the day's slump to the overnight sharp fall
on Wall Street and the adverse effect of Bank of Japan's move to
maintain its monetary stance.
</P>
<P>
They said Bank of Japan's decision to keep its monetary policy
unchanged disappointed the market which was anticipating concrete
moves to reverse the sustained strength of the yen.

<HEADLINE> Discipline Commission Explains Senior Party Official Bribery Case ( 2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With Xu's support and connivance, the company's business office
general manager violated management regulations and his acts of
embezzlement and bribery failed to be investigated and prosecuted
timely, causing assets losses worth 1.197 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In response to his son's request, Xu ordered Ningbo Daily to
purchase the Huahong International Center building, which is of
poor quality.
</P>
<P>
The building's owner gave Xu's son money and goods worth more
than 2 million yuan in return. At Xu's wife's request, Xu also
helped a Ningbo company get 25.67 million yuan and 5.4 million U.S.
dollars worth of loans. The general manager of the company gave Xu
's wife more than 4 million yuan in return. The company now can
not afford to pay back the loans.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection said that, as a senior Party official, Xu took
advantage of his post and repeatedly responded to his wife's and
his son's requests for personal return. His wife and son received
a large amount of money and goods in return.
</P>
<P>
The standing committee of the commission believes that the acts
caused serious economic losses for the Party and the State and
caused very bad political influence and it said that Xu's actions
were a serious violation of Party disciplines and that Xu is not
qualified to be a Party member.
</P>
<P>
Some of Xu's actions may have violated the criminal law and
they will be dealt with by the judiciary.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Communique of 4th Plenum of CPC Central Committee (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was pointed out at the plenum that the strategic adjustment
of the layout of the State sector of the economy needs to be
combined with optimization of and improvements in the industrial
and ownership structure, sticking to advancement in some areas and
retrenchment in others and refraining from some things in order to
do others, so as to increase the ability of the State sector to
control the economy. The State sector needs to be given a dominant
position in important industries and key sectors that are closely
related to the national economic lifeline, while in other
industries and sectors the effort should be concentrated on
improving the overall quality of the economy by means of capital
restructuring and structural adjustments. Effective methods of
public ownership must be explored, a joint stock system and mixed
forms of ownership developed vigorously, and major enterprises
held by the State. A continuous effort needs to be made in the
strategic restructuring of State-owned enterprises, making full
use of the market mechanism, vigorously developing large
enterprises and enterprise groups, and relaxing controls over mid-
sized and small State-owned enterprises to breathe more life into
them. The role of other mid-sized and small enterprises needs to
be brought into play in promoting social and economic development,
and efforts need to be made to actively support science and
technology businesses, and develop service systems for mid-sized
and small enterprises. The State needs to increase support for
adjusting the distribution of industry and reorganizing
enterprises in old industrial bases, the central and western parts
of the country and areas inhabited by ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Those attending the plenum pointed out that a modern enterprise
system is the orientation of State-owned enterprise reforms and an
effective way to combine public ownership with a market economy.
The separation of government functions from enterprise management
needs to be continued and effective forms of State assets
management explored under a principle of State ownership,
management at different levels, authorized operation, and
supervision based on division of labor. Large and mid-sized State-
owned enterprises should carry out reforms in accordance with the
standards of the corporate system, establish a better corporate
management structure, and gear their operation systems to the
market. They should establish an income distribution system that
conforms to the modern enterprise system and provide effective
incentive and restraints. There needs to be a concrete emphasis on
strengthening enterprise management, studying development
strategies, perfecting rules and regulations, strengthening weak
links, adopting modern management skills, methods and means, and
increasing economic gains.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's GDP Growth Lower Than Projected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) this year will only grow by just over one percent,
lower than the projected four percent because of a decline in
output in the mining, quarrying and construction sectors.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary data indicate that the decline in the expected
economic growth has largely been caused by the operational
problems at the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) which has
adversely affected the mining and quarrying sectors, Times of
Zambia newspaper Wednesday quoted the Bank of Zambia senior
economist Jacob Lushinga as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, substantial economic growth is expected in
the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector estimated to grow by six percent this
year is expected to contribute a large portion to the growth of
the GDP, he added.
</P>
<P>
Other areas expected to record positive growth include the
sectors of manufacturing, power and services, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lushinga, the increase in prices of petroleum
products and electricity tariffs between April and July is the
main cause for the rise in inflation rates.
</P>
<P>
On the Balance of Payments, Lushinga said preliminary estimates
showed that the position improved to a surplus of 36.2 million
U.S. dollars in the second quarter against a deficit of 22.2
million dollars recorded in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
And the economic activity for this year is expected to face
many challenges like high inflation rates emanating from expected
oil price and electricity tariff hikes and a further delay in
disposing of the remaining units of ZCCM, he said.

<HEADLINE> Arson Destroys Aircraft in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A mysterious fire has reduced
a light aircraft to debris at a airport in the suburb of the
Kenyan capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Arsonists sneaked into the Wilson Airport at 2 a.m. Tuesday and
used explosives to blow up the 14-seat aircraft worth 1.4 million
U.S. dollars, according to airport authorities.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft was set ablaze in the parking area, just 15 meters
from the airport's main gate, Daily Nation reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The police immediately launched investigations to uncover who
was behind the incident.
</P>
<P>
The plane was reportedly at the center of a legal case between
three family members of the late North Eastern Province chief
Abdulahi Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
On September 15, a justice at a commercial court gave an order
to ground the aircraft at the airport until the dispute was
resolved.
</P>
<P>
The plane used to fly on a weekly basis between Nairobi and
Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Defense Minister Calls for Reorientation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The military, like all other
Nigerians, " want nothing short of true democracy in a united and
peaceful country," said Lt. Gen. Theophilus Danjuma, Nigeria's
Defense Minister Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But the civil populace, and not only the military, needs
reorientation if the nascent experiment in this country were to
blossom, the Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Wednesday
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted those existing strains in the current polity
 traceable to long years of military intervention in governance.
But there is need, he stressed, for partnership between civilians
and the military for intended professional restoration of the
institution to be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
The long military involvement in politics is an aberration, and
that is why strains and teething problems in the new civil rule
have been witnessed,
</P>
<P>
said Danjuma. So the drive for reorientation "should not be
limited to the military only."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Resolution On Fighting Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua)-- China's Supreme People's
Procuratorate will have a resolution on dealing with corruption to
push forward the nation's campaign against bribery and
embezzlement, Zhao Dengju, deputy procurator-general of the SPP,
told a national conference on anti-corruption here today.
</P>
<P>
The resolution's purpose is to standardize investigation
procedures and to perfect the prosecuting mechanism to improve the
case-handling ability of people's procuratorates, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
China's corruption work has made some progress in quest for
justice and openness, Zhao said, and procuratorates nationwide
have dealt with a great number of corruption cases. Since 1997,
people's procuratorates' anti-corruption departments have dealt
with more than 103,000 bribery and embezzlement cases, arrested
some 115,000 suspects, and recovered 10 billion yuan worth of lost
property.
</P>
<P>
But, even with the achievements, the group charged with
fighting corruption faces challenges. For example, some
prosecutors are not really qualified and cannot adapt to the
changing situation, Zhao pointed out. He asked all prosecutors to
make a greater effort in the fight against corruption to create a
healthier, long-lasting corruption-free society.

It was gold that shone with the index soaring 58.8 points or 6.95

<HEADLINE> Women in Poor Countries More Exposed to Birth Harms: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report prepared by the United Nations Population Fund said
there are still 350 million women in developing countries who do
not have access to a range of safe and effective family planning
methods and up to half of the nearly 175 million pregnancies each
year are unwanted or ill-timed.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, there are no trained childbirth specialists
present during almost half of all births in developing countries,
putting the lives of mothers and babies in danger, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, every minute more than one woman die
of problems related to childbirth and pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
It said one study found that where mothers' death rates were
very high, the risk could be reduced by as much as 80 percent by
providing care during pregnancy, information about warning signs
and emergency obstetric care during childbirth.
</P>
<P>
In addition to deaths, complications arising in pregnancy and
childbirth can have long-lasting effects. It is estimated that at
least 7 million women suffer from serious health problems and as
many as 50 million suffer some health consequences after
childbirth each year.
</P>
<P>
In many developing countries, girls often marry and begin
childbearing at an early age, sometimes before reaching full
maturity, increasing the risk of pregnancy-related death or injury
and jeopardizing their children's chances of survival, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The report said another infliction to women is unsafe abortion,
which claims the lives of some 70,000 women annually.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed that married and unmarried adolescents
should have access to reproductive health information and services
including family planning to avoid unwanted harms to women.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Education Hit by High Drop-out Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya government is
worried that the high drop-out rates in schools may frustrate its
efforts to achieve education for all by 2050.
</P>
<P>
Daily Nation Newspaper Wednesday quoted a top education
official as saying that more students have dropped out in the past
decade despite a "substantial increase" in budgetary allocations.
</P>
<P>
Out of the pupils enrolled in Standard One, only 47 percent
complete the primary education; out of these, only 17 percent
survive to complete the secondary schooling, Permanent Secretary
of the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology Wilfred
Kimalat said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that only seven percent of high-school graduates are
lucky enough to go to public universities, which means that only
1.2 percent of those who begin the education cycle make it to
university.
</P>
<P>
According to Kimalat, the education allocations have more than
tripled over the past eight years.

<HEADLINE> Senior Party Official Expelled from CPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Xu Yunhong, an alternate
member of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee, was
expelled from the CPC.
</P>
<P>
This was decided at the 4th Plenary Session of the 15th CPC
Central Committee which ended in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The plenum had examined and approved a report submitted by the
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection on the Xu case.
</P>
<P>
Xu was an alternate member of the CPC Central Committee, a
standing committee member of the CPC Zhejiang Provincial Committee
and secretary of the Ningbo City Party Committee, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Xu, at the request of his son, helped the
business department of a Ningbo trust and investment company
obtain the qualifications for independent fund-raising, and his
son was given money and things for this, totaling to an equivalent
of more than 900,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Xu, again at the request of his son, ordered the Ningbo Daily
to buy the building of the Huahong International Center which is
of poor quality, and at the request of his wife, helped a Ningbo
firm to get loans by abusing his power. The firm now is not able
to repay its huge amount of loans.
</P>
<P>
The Central Discipline Inspection Commission holds that Xu, as
a senior Party official, abused his power time and again for the
benefits of his wife and son, causing big economic loss to the
Party and State and very bad political influence, and seriously
violating the Party discipline.
</P>
<P>
As some of what Xu had done has violated the law, his case
should be dealt with by judicial departments according to law, the
plenum said in a communique.

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli General Security Services Chief Ami Ayalon told a
parliamentary committee Tuesday that he plans to discuss with
Prime Minister Ehud Barak on taking more action against the
terrorist hardcore of the Islamic Movement in Israel. The security
cabinet is expected soon to discuss the involvement of the Islamic
Movement in recent abortive terror attacks.

-- An American diplomat says Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat will not win any new commitments from
U.S. President Bill Clinton at a White House meeting Thursday, in
which they will discuss the principles of the negotiations on the
final settlement with Israel. Israeli sources say, however, the
very fact that the meeting is taking place is paramount, as part
of the Palestinian desire to maintain close ties and coordination
with the Americans.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli security services have apprehended a fourth
terrorist who escaped death in two abortive car bombings in Haifa
and Tiberias early this month which killed three of his
accomplices. Ibrahim Al Magid Salah, an Israeli-Arab youth, told
the investigators that they had planned to leave bags containing
explosives in two buses leaving for Jerusalem, and had no
intention of carrying out suicide attacks. Investigators assume
that the bombs went off prematurely as a result of an operational
mishap.

<HEADLINE> World Population to Hit Six Billion: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The world population will
hit six billion on October 12, doubling since 1960 and an increase
of one billion people in just 12 years, according to a report
issued here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report entitled "The State of World Population, 1999"
prepared by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) said global
population is rising by about 78 million people a year, although
the growth rate has slowed from 2.4 to 1.3 percent in the past 30
years.
</P>
<P>
The report projects that world population will grow from the
current 6 billion to between 7.3 and 10.7 billion by 2050, with
8.9 billion considered the most likely. This means that the world
population may grow almost as much in the next 50 years as in the
past 50 years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that over 95 percent of the growth is taking
place in the world's poorest and least-prepared countries, such as
sub-Saharan Africa, parts of South Asia and Western Asia. In
Sub-Saharan Africa, the average woman has 5.5 children.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, population growth has slowed or stopped in Europe,
North America and Japan, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The united States is the only industrial country where large
population increases are still projected, largely as the result of
immigration, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Due to improved education and health care and increased access
to family planning in Asia, Africa and Latin America, birth rates
in developing countries have dropped from six children per woman
in 1969 to under three today.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, the regions and countries with high
birth rate also have more young people. In 62 countries in Africa,
Asia and Latin America, over 40 percent of the population is under
age 15.
Presenting a bleak picture in the developing countries, it said
over one billion people are still deprived of basic needs and, of
the 4.8 billion people in developing countries, nearly three
fifths lack basic sanitation, almost a third have no access to
clean water, a quarter do not have adequate housing and a fifth
have no access to modern health services, a fifth of children do
not attend school to grade 5.
</P>
<P>
UNFPA presents a report on the state of world population every
year.

<HEADLINE> Former Boxer Sentenced for Selling Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Chris Clarke, Canada's Olympic
boxer in 1976, was sentenced to two years in prison for selling
drugs, a report from Halifax, Canada, said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who was sentenced Tuesday, pleaded guilty to two counts
of trafficking cocaine at a Halifax bar, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time Clarke has been before the court on
drug charges. In 1991, he was sentenced to 16 months in jail for
selling cocaine to an undercover policewoman.
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old Clarke sold small amounts of cocaine and crack
to an undercover officer in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
Clarke held the Commonwealth welterweight and Canadian
middleweight titles in the late 1970s. His 21-year boxing career
ended on September 29, 1987, when he was knocked out by Shawn O'
Sullivan.

<HEADLINE> Volcano Activity "Worrisome:" Phivolcs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Mayon Volcano in the southern
Philippines belched off ashes for four minutes shortly before noon
Wednesday, the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology
(Phivolcs) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the explosion, a quake of high-frequency and a tremor
of short duration were detected in the 24-hour period, Phivolcs
said in a bulletin.
</P>
<P>
while describing the activity as "worrisome" and warning people
to stay away from the Permanent Danger Zone (PDZ) of the volcano,
the institute said it was a "weak to wispy steaming" off. Sulfuric
acid flux was measured at 1,740 tons as of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Experts said extra precaution must be specially taken by
residents along the Bonga Gully on the southeast sector of the
volcano.
</P>
<P>
The current alert level is maintained at 2, which means
volcanoes show "unrest of probably magnetic origin and could
eventually lead to eruption."
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Corpuz of Phivolcs said despite today's low-level
alert, Mayon's recent "closely-spaced eruptions" could be a cause
for worry, for these could suddenly lead to a "full explosion."
</P>
<P>
The highest seismic level at Phivolcs is 5, a "hazardous" or
"full explosion," such as when Mayon exploded in April 1993 and
caused 70 deaths in the PDZ, Corpuz added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Blames U.S., British Envoys for Blocking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Health Ministry on
Wednesday blamed the U.S. and British governments for delaying
the approval of 24 medical contracts it signed with foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ministry criticized the U.S. and British
representatives at the U.N. Sanctions Committee for fabricating
lies and excuses to prevent supplying Iraq with medicine and
medical appliances.
</P>
<P>
These blocked contracts were concluded in the previous phases
of the oil-for-food program under sums allocated for the health
sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that 15 percent of the contracts of the
first phase of the deal has not been shipped yet despite the
elapse of three years after they were concluded.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added that still put on hold under flimsy pretexts
are four contracts worth 1.7 million U.S. dollars of the second
phase, two contracts valued at 2.4 million dollars of the fourth
phase and 18 contracts of the fifth phase worth 44 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, now in its sixth phase which
expires in November, Iraq is allowed to export limited amount of
oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the deal, the ceiling of the
amount of oil Iraq is allowed to sell has been raised to
5.2 billion dollars from 2 billion dollars for the first three
phases.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys at
the Sanctions Committee of hampering the endorsement of its
contracts, arguing that the oil-for-food deal has failed to
alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the United Nations' Children Fund
(UNICEF), mortality rates among Iraqi children have more than
doubled since the imposition of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq in
1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Health Ministry announced on Sunday that nearly 8,000
Iraqi children aged under five died in last August of
various curable diseases and malnutrition due to the continuation
of the nine-year-old embargo.

<HEADLINE> El Al Delays Decision to Choose Between Boeing, Airbus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel's national airliner
El Al has delayed a decision on from which of the two biggest
aircraft manufacturers in the world to purchase new planes in the
coming years, local media reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted El Al Director-General Joseph Ciechanover
as saying that his company is seeking for specific proposals from
the U.S.-based Boeing and the France-based Airbus for the deal,
which is estimated at some 350 million to 400 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
An El Al spokesman said the Israeli airline wants to obtain
commitments from Boeing and Airbus concerning subsequent deals
that will result from the upcoming arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The decision will be postponed from Wednesday until next week,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Vying for the contract, both Boeing and Airbus have sent their
top executives to Israel in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
Boeing is trying to sell three 777s to El Al, offering to buy
back some of its 757s previously sold to this 38-year customer.
</P>
<P>
Airbus is offering El Al two A340 and two A330 planes,
promising to pump back roughly 150 million dollars in offset
purchases.
</P>
<P>
El Al currently operates an all-Boeing fleet and the Israeli
government is a key customer for Boeing's military
business. Boeing triumphed against Airbus in El Al's last tender
in December 1997.

<HEADLINE> Over 1,000 Participants Expected for Maritime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 participants
from 35 countries will attend "Maritime Cyprus '99", a major
conference on shipping, to be held on October 3-6, the Cyprus Mail
newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The conference, with the theme of "Shipping in the Dawn of a
New Century," is organized by Cyprus' government in cooperation
with the Central Bank of Cyprus and the Cyprus Shipping Council,
a private shipping institution.
</P>
<P>
The conference will focus on the latest developments in
shipping industry in the European Union (EU), ship finance,
shipbrokering, the policy of international organizations of both
workers in the shipping industry and shipowners, and the
prospects of the shipping markets.
</P>
<P>
The list of speakers includes Williams O'Neil, Secretary
General of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and
George Vassiliou, Cyprus' chief negotiator in the island's
accession talks with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Permanent Secretary of Cyprus' Communications and Works
Ministry Vassos Pyrgos told the press on Tuesday that over the
past few years Cyprus had worked hard to upgrade the image and
the quality of its fleet.
</P>
<P>
"A lot has been done also in the prevention of sea pollution
and the improvement of working conditions on Cyprus ships, which
creates hope for higher standards of safety," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ranks the sixth on the list of maritime countries, with
2,667 vessels and 26.5 million gross tons.
</P>
<P>
A total of 120 accidents happened in 1998 involving
Cyprus-flagged ships, which resulted in the deaths of 28 people and
the loss of five ships.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, there have been 53 accidents, which resulted
in the deaths of nine people and the loss of three ships.

<HEADLINE> Camels into Chinese Capital for National Ethnic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- With most part of an expected
field of 4,500 athletes checked-in in various Beijing hotels for
China's Sixth National Games of Traditional Ethnic Sports opening
on Friday, there are some unusual arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Camels, 12 of them, have being warming up in a horse racing
track in a northeastern Beijing suburb since Monday, for a
demonstration race at the week-long National Games here.
</P>
<P>
The giant and usually tame animals were used for transportation
to and from Beijing a long time ago. But now only in the Zoo can
Beijing kids have a closer look of the friendly animals.
</P>
<P>
The camels were hand-picked from Alxa and Bayannur Leagues in
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region near China's northern border.
</P>
<P>
"They must be smart, strong and, of course, tame,"
Qinggelebayer, coach of the Alxa League camel racing team, said of
how they were chosen.
</P>
<P>
"The herdsmen in our League were very eager to show up with
their livestock and have them picked up, feeling proud of the
honor of showing them at the National Games. But we only need six,
" said the 49-year-old official of the League's farming and animal
husbandry bureau. The six others were picked up from neiboring
Bayannur League and are scheduled to be here later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"They are really smart, aren't they?" proudly asked
Qinggelebayer, a veterinarian himself and a participant of the
past three National Games.
</P>
<P>
The camels were then transported aboard a truck more than 1,600
kilometers eastward to the Chinese capital. "48 hard hours, with
heavy rains for some 36 hours," he recalled. "We are lucky they (
camels) didn't catch cold," he said, all smiles.
</P>
<P>
"The weather in Beijing is nice and our camels go around very
well. The riders are now trying to decorate them up so as to
present a more attractive show at the Games."
</P>
<P>
The six other camels? "The Bayannur's camels could run faster,
but ours are surely smarter," he commented.

<HEADLINE> 43 Percent of Bangladeshis Below 15 Years Old: UNFPA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Some 43 percent of the
Bangladeshi population are below 15 years old, and, as a result,
the potential for future growth is tremendous, the United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) representative in Bangladesh said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At present, Bangladesh has an estimated population of 126
million, UNFPA representative Shuyun Xu told a press conference
at the National Press Club here, adding that the country has
achieved remarkable progress in reducing the population growth
rate from 3 percent in 1973 to 1.6 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Under the most optimistic assumption, Bangladesh's population
would reach 170 million when stabilization of population happens
in 40-45 years' time and if the level for replacement - two
children per couple - is reached by 2005, the UNFPA official said.
</P>
<P>
But a less optimistic and also "a more realistic scenario"
shows that the country's population could reach 200 and 250
million and stabilize around the middle of the next century,
according to Xu.
</P>
<P>
Adolescents aged 10-19 years represent one-fifth of the
country's total population, and the proportion is likely to grow
up to 22 percent during 2000-2005, while the elderly population
will increase from 6 percent in 1995 to 7.7 percent in 2000 and
then 9.1 percent in 2010, he said.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that as the present population programs in the country
are not adequate to meet the requirements of the adolescent and
elderly population, "it is time to reorient policies to meet
adolescent and elderly people's needs."
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of country's population live in poverty and almost
one in every two Bangladeshis is illiterate.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urged to Stay in COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
appealed to Tanzania to reconsider its decision to pull out of the
Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
Kenyan High Commissioner Joseph Sefu made this appeal in an
interview in Lusaka Tuesday, saying the decision of withdrawal is
ill-timed, especially at a period when COMESA is in the process of
transforming itself into a regional economic grouping.
</P>
<P>
All other member states are urging Tanzania to remain in the
21-member grouping, Sefu was quoted by Wednesday's Times of Zambia
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If Tanzania pulls out, it will be bad because member states
will have to pass through a non-member," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sefu, who is also Chairman of COMESA Council of Ministers, said
no member states had asked to postpone the deadline of zero-tariff
rating from October 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania announced recently that it will withdraw from COMESA
on the ground that given its uncompetitive industrial base, it
will not benefit from the free trade area the grouping will
establish next year.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Issue Eurobonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon is expected to launch
its new sovereign euro and U.S. dollar bonds worth 750 million
U.S. dollars on either Wednesday or Thursday, the Daily Star
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Underwriters Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter said Monday night the 10-year dollar tranche would be
priced to yield 425-450 basis points over U.S. treasuries, while
the spread on the seven-year euro tranche would be between 37/8
and 41/8 percentage points over French treasuries.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the issue is reduced to 500 million to 600 million
dollars, with pricing of 4 percentage points for the euro and 425
basis points for the dollar, it would still be a very successful
issue," said Joe Sarrouh, senior official at the country's leading
bank Fransabank.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has sold more than 3 billion eurobonds since 1994,
often at tighter spreads than those achieved by higher-rated
sovereign borrowers.
</P>
<P>
Its 1 billion U.S. dollar eurobond in April 1998 was the
largest sovereign issue ever in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Spreads on the new eurobond will be wider than current
secondary market yields on the five-year bonds that Lebanon
issued in February worth 200 million dollars and 300 million
euros.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the wider spreads this time reflect general
market conditions and also Lebanon's desire to attract more
international investments.
</P>
<P>
Its previous sovereign debt issues have been bought largely by
Lebanese banks and other Arab financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors are expected to subscribe to 25-35 percent
of the issue, compared to about 15 percent of previous eurobonds,
after being courted in recent weeks on a European and North
American roadshow held by the underwriters and Lebanese finance
ministry's officials.
</P>
<P>
The new eurobond is the first issue in a 2 billion foreign
borrowing program approved by Parliament in July and is designed to
reduce the government's reliance on short-term, expensive
Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
Foreign borrowing only accounts for one quarter of Lebanon's
public debt of almost 20 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan University Okays Army's Imported Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Senior food experts from
Uganda's Makerere University have declared the disputed dry ration
recently rejected by the army, fit for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
In a report compiled by the experts, George Nasinyama in
charge of the university food hygiene laboratory, said that there
was no indication of spoilage of the food as well as presence of
pathogenic micro-organisms in the tested food at the time of the
report.
</P>
<P>
He, however, warned that the food should be consumed soon or
it might spoil fast unless kept in better storage conditions of
insect proof, low relative humidity with forced ventilation, the
New Vision daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The dry ration, worth some 1.5 million U.S. dollars, comprises
955,000 tins of beans, 955,000 tins of chicken stew and 955,000
sachets of biscuits.
</P>
<P>
It was supplied on credit by Kramer Trade and Technology of
South Africa in June this year.
</P>
<P>
The fresh tests were carried out at the request of the Defense
Ministry following conflicting reports on the quality of the
soldiers' ration issued by a government-appointed pre-shipment
inspection team and government chemists.

<HEADLINE> UAE Natural Gas Producer Poised to Increase Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction
Co. (Adgas), the major liquefied natural gas (LNG) producer of the
United Arab Emirates, is making an effort to increase the capacity
of its third LNG plant through a debottlenecking process.
</P>
<P>
"The aim is to seek any bottlenecks in the processing plant for
possible or potential upgrade in output," Fahim Kazem, Adgas
manager for engineering and technical services, was quoted by Gulf
News as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is at a study and discussion stage and some options are
under consideration to prove its feasibility," he added.
</P>
<P>
He did not mention what the enhanced capacity of the plant
would be after implementing the debottlenecking process.
</P>
<P>
The current capacity of Adgas' third plant is more than 1.5
million tons per year (tpy).
</P>
<P>
Industry officials said that debottlenecking could raise
output by between 25 to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Qatar Liquefied Gas Co. (Qatargas) has produced an
additional 1 million tpy of LNG by applying similar technique,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The current total capacity of Adgas, with three plants, is over
4.5 million tpy. It also produces liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)
and sulphur.
</P>
<P>
Since Adgas set up the Middle East's first LNG plant in 1979,
four more grassroot LNG projects have been implemented or are in
the process, Gulf News said.
</P>
<P>
These include Qatargas (with a capacity of 6 million tpy), the
Ras Laffan LNG Co. (5.2 million tpy), Oman LNG Co. (6.6 million
tpy) and the Yemen LNG Co. (5.2 million tpy).

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Kenya to Disarm Warriors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Uganda
and Kenya will carry out a joint operation to disarm the armed
warriors in Karamoja and Turkana regions in the two countries
where they rustle each other's cattle.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Ugandan Prime Minister Appolo Nsibambi in
response to a report by a parliamentary committee which urged the
government to solve the Karamoja issue completely, the New Vision
paper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government is liaising along with Kenya,
Sudan and Ethiopia within the Inter-governmental Agency on
Development to carry out simultaneous disarmament in this part of
east Africa and to stop further influx of weapons into Karamoja.
</P>
<P>
The government was working hard to coordinate security
intervention in the region characterized by drought, lack of
development and armed conflicts, he added.
</P>
<P>
Warriors in the region rustle cattle from neighboring tribes
and sometimes from neighboring countries. In a recent clash
between two tribes,
</P>
<P>
some 500 people were killed and the figure might shoot up to a
higher level unless military intervention was resorted to in
time.
</P>
<P>
The region reportedly has 8,000 guns, mainly obtained from
arms depot deserted by former armies of the country. The
government has been urged several times to disarm the warriors,
but it did not because the government says that the disarmament
would leave Ugandans there vulnerable to attacks of warriors from
neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Journalist Injured in U.S.-British Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 22 (Xinhua) -- A Swedish journalist was
injured in U.S.-British warplanes' attacks on Iraqi targets on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The journalist, identified as Jan Arell, is part of a Swedish
press delegation that was visiting the historic southern Iraqi
city of Ur, the Iraqi News Agency INA reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Arell, working for the Swedish Gottenburg Post, was
wounded in the chest after being hit by a splinter of a missile
which dropped some meters from the car carrying the press
delegation.
</P>
<P>
After being taken to hospital and treated, Arell sent a story
to his newspaper in Sweden, in which he wrote that he did not find
any military site or see Iraqi anti-aircraft defenses in the area
shelled by the U.S. and British warplanes, said INA.
</P>
<P>
"What has taken place to the Swedish reporter in the city
of Ur is a tangible evidence refuting lies of the U.S. and
British aggressors who claim that they are shelling military
sites and anti-aircraft defenses and they are not targetting
residential areas nor citizens," said INA.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have been regularly attacking Iraqi civilian
facilities and military sites, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led
western allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed
aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite
Muslims in the south from attacks by Iraqi government troops.

MANILA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Lawmakers of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) affirmed here Wednesday their
commitment to make the region peaceful, secure and nuclear-free,
despite "threats of conflict from within and outside".
</P>
<P>
In concluding the 20th general assembly of the ASEAN
Inter-Parliamentary Organization (AIPO), the legislators also
approved 19 resolutions concretizing their common concerns.
</P>
<P>
Manuel Villar, Philippine house speaker and the outgoing
president of the AIPO, said "the spirit of ASEAN solidarity and
consensus" as well as "camaraderie" swiftly pave the way for the
approval of those political, social and economical resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The more than 200 delegates from the eight ASEAN member
countries pledged to build up the group as a potent economic force
by supporting the ASEAN Free Trade Area and by making structural
changes to allow transparency in public and private institutions.
</P>
<P>
The AIPO delegates also formalized their concerns about the
moral and social implications of globalization, the impact of
population on ASEAN development, and the need to contain the
spread of crime, drug abuse and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since the group's inception, a separate
committee discussed the need to further empower women, especially
in making sure they receive equal access to education and fair
compensation for their labor.
</P>
<P>
The AIPO remains an effective means of dialogue between the
ASEAN members and the observer nations comprising Australia,
China, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Russia.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Chinese delegate Xu Dunxin gave the
assurance that China will not devalue its currency, although he
added that this assurance cannot be held "forever".
</P>
<P>
During the closing rites of the three-day meeting, Villar
handed the AIPO presidency to Speaker Tan Soo Khoon of Singapore,
host country of the year 2000 general assembly.

</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, many of the world's best known business

China, and up to now more than 300 of the Fortune 500 have

Advanced technology and management techniques plus more

<P>
After China adopted its reforms and opening-up policy in the
late 1970s, multinationals gradually began returning to China. In
the 1980s though, there were still not very many. Only Germany's
Volkswagen, Japan's Sanyo, and a few other giants began large-
scale investment, while others made trial investments on a trial
basis, according to China's Institute of International Economic
Cooperation and Trade.
</P>
<P>
As the reforms and opening-up increased, China began shifting
from a big potential markets to a more realistic one and
international corporations began to regard China as a more
attractive investment site, according to the Institute's Wang
Zhile.
</P>
<P>
Their experiences in investment in the 1980s helped them to
introduce more systematic investment in the 1990s. Since 1993, the
multinationals have continued to make investment on a large scale.

The multinationals have used trade and technology cooperation
to gradually put China in their global business network, Wang says.
</P>
<P>
The big companies have invested in China for long-term
strategic interests and have made long-term development strategies
and detailed plans in China for choice of projects, partners, and
location.
</P>
<P>
How to consolidate their hold in China has become a major
problem of multinationals, Wang says, and to ensure success in
China, they have implemented a localization strategy in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
So many multinationals entering into a country in such a short
time was unprecedented, Wang points out, and their presence has
led to intense competition in China, something that will push the
globalization of China's economy further faster.
</P>
<P>
With the improvements in the investment environment here and
more favorable policies, more multinationals are expected to come

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: What Prompts Thailand to Exit IMF? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand needs no more funds
from the International Monetary Fund (IMF)-sponsored 17.2 billion
U.S. dollar rescue package for the time being, Thai cabinet
decided Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move, some analysts said, showed that Thailand finally
starts to stand on its own feet.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's boldness came directly from the country's restored
foreign reserves, which have reached a comfortable level of 32.2
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"That we don't need to borrow further shows our confidence that
our foreign reserves are at a stage appropriate for recovery,"
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said Tuesday after a
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Other economic indicators also point to a recovering economy,
according to the eighth letter of intent to the IMF, which gained
approval of the cabinet Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's economy posted a growth of 3.5 percent from April to
June this year compared with the same quarter last year, the
National Economic and Social Development Board announced earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
It is the second consecutive quarter which has seen an economic
growth since the second quarter of 1997. In the first quarter this
year, the economy increased 0.8 percent compared with the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter of this year, the industrial sector
posted the largest gains, growing 7.7 percent year-on-year.
</P>
<P>
The letter of intent, serving as the latest economic review
between the government and the IMF, painted a rosy picture for
Thailand's economy this year by raising its projection of the Thai
economic growth from 1 percent to between 3 and 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
It will be a sharp turnaround from the 10-percent contraction
recorded last year and a fall of 1.8 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices have also fallen sharply, with inflation
projected at 0.5 percent for 1999 compared with 8.1 percent in
1998 and 5.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign reserves, which had depleted to only
about 800 million dollars in August 1997 after a failed baht
defense battle, are expected to stabilize at a targeted level of
32 billion to 34 billion dollars by the end of this year, equal to
7.5 months' export cover and 2.4 times of the country's short-term
external debt.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's current account surplus for 1999 is projected at
11.6 billion dollars, or 9 percent of GDP and overall exports are
expected to reach 55 billion dollars, an increase of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the strong economic indicators, politics also
played a role in the country's decision of ending fund withdrawal,
some analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin and the ruling Democrat Party have long
been criticized for following strictly the IMF prescription and
ignoring the plight of the real economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
Some even said the IMF program made the country sell national
assets at cheap prices to speculative foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to detach itself from the IMF at a
time when the general election is expected next year or possibly
later this year is considered by some analysts as a move to woo
more votes.
</P>
<P>
Besides, stopping withdrawals will also ease Thailand's
interest rate payments to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
However, despite its boldness, Thailand is cautious enough to
say it will retain the right of withdrawing funds from the rest
of the package when it feels necessary.
</P>
<P>
"In light of improved outlook, it is not envisaged that further
drawings will be made from the official financing package, unless
the external environment were to deteriorate," the letter of
intent said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai currency, the baht, which traded in a stable narrow
range of 36-38 to the dollar in the first seven months of this
year, has weakened in recent few weeks in line with a highly
volatile yen. It dropped to 40 baht to the dollar last week, the
lowest in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
So far, Thailand has drawn about 13.47 billion dollars from the
bailout package, granted to the country by the IMF in August 1997,
a month after the financial crisis broke out.
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry officials said the country will still stay in
the IMF economic-reform program and maintain the current fiscal
and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
Given the 2.65 trillion baht (66.3 billion dollar)
non-performing loans (NPLs) in the banking system, which account
for 47.5 percent of the total outstanding credit, Thailand has the
reason to be cautious.
</P>
<P>
The letter of intent also admitted that progress in
restructuring has been "difficult," hindering the resumption of
normal credit flows.
</P>
<P>
Tarrin also said NPLs had shown signs of improvement in recent
months, but acknowledged that progress has been slow.

BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Telephone calls from Beijing

<HEADLINE> Kostov: Join A Single Europe, Solve Problems Between Bulgaria, Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- To solve the problems between
Bulgaria and Macedonia is for them to join a single Europe,
Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov said after meeting with his
Macedonian counterpart Ljubco Georgievski Tuesday in Blagoevgrad,
Southwestern Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
He said that skepticism of the implementation of the Stability
Pact for Southeastern Europe is growing and may even turn into
disappointment, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"Both Georgievski and I are with boosted self-confidence
because of the role, which our countries played in overcoming one
of the most serious conflicts in Southeastern Europe and in
establishing a policy of cooperation and not of confrontation in
the region," said Kostov.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria will support Macedonia's efforts for speeding up
integration into the European Union, said Kostov.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Georgievski said that several months ago, the two
countries began creating a spirit of trust by overcoming their
dispute over the use of language.
</P>
<P>
He added under an agreement of military aid, Bulgaria will give
Macedonia 94 tanks and other equipment, of which the first two
shipments have already arrived in Macedonia and the rest is to be
sent by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Without regional cooperation there can be no Euro-Atlantic
integration, stressed Georgievski.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Agreement on free trade between Bulgaria and
Macedonia is expected to be signed on October 13 and enter into
force on January 1, next year, said Bulgarian Trade Minister
Valentin Vassilev after meeting with his Macedonian counterpart
Nikola Gruevski.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria will support Macedonia in signing similar agreement
with the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) and the EU,
he noted.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Auto Industry Facing Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Automotive
Industry Corporation (Group) will face the challenges of a global
automotive industry in a positive manner, the group's president Hu
Maoyuan said on the eve of the '99 Fortune Forum to be held here
September 27-29.
</P>
<P>
As China's largest automobile producer, the corporation sold
230,000 Satana-brand cars in 1998. Its profit stood at 5.52
billion yuan (665 million U.S. dollars) and sales income at 74.9
billion yuan (9 billion dollars), accounting for 33 percent and 9.
4 percent of the country's automotive industry, respectively,
according to Hu.
</P>
<P>
At present, the automotive industry is the No.one pillar
industry of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"It was the reform and opening policy that provided the
opportunity for the rapid development of the Shanghai automotive
industry," said the president.
</P>
<P>
In the past two decades, Hu said, Shanghai's car output rose
100-fold, sales income increased at an annual average rate of 28
percent, and profit increased at an annual rate of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has established 33 overseas-funded automotive
enterprises in cooperation with Germany, the United States, Japan,
Italy, France, and five other countries and regions during the
past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Despite this remarkable progress, Hu Maoyuan said that there is
still a long way to go for the Shanghai automotive industry, which
began far behind the world's large automotive enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Most Foreign Investors in Shanghai Positive about Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Sixty-one percent of the
111 surveyed multinational investing in Shanghai hold a positive
attitude toward China's economy, and 78 percent confide in the
future of Shanghai's economy, according to the latest statistics
from the Shanghai Foreign Trade and Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
Hu Zhonghua, deputy head of the committee, said that among
these enterprises, 27 percent have faith in the Asian economy.
</P>
<P>
There are now 250 of the world's top 500 firms, and 59 of the
100 largest industrial multinational corporations with branches or
agencies in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Above 75 percent of the polled enterprises and agencies said
that the municipality's investment policies will inspire them to
increase their investments, and 66.67 percent said that investment
in Shanghai will help reduce their cost.
</P>
<P>
Hu said this survey shows that the implementation of the reform
and opening policy has scored substantial results over the last 20
years.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons for their confidence in China are the
stability of the Chinese currency, the reduction of bank interests
and tariffs in China, and the resolute fight against smuggling
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
However, about half of those surveyed noted that complicated
registration and approval procedures cause some problems for
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
To attract more investment from overseas, the Shanghai
municipal government plans to set up overseas agencies to offer
still better services and consultations for overseas businesses,
simplify registration procedures, implement preferential policies
for the development of private enterprises and joint ventures, and
encourage investment in technological, medical, and educational
fields, Hu added.
</P>
<P>
Hu predicts that a continuous rise in domestic demand across
the country will ensure a high growth rate of economic development
in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August, the municipality had approved nearly 200,
000 foreign-funded projects from 84 countries and regions, and
attracted 37.747 billion U.S. dollars, with 26.298 billion U.S.
dollars in actual use now.

<HEADLINE> Exit Poll Shows Big NDA Lead in Indian Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 22 (Xinhua) -- An exit poll conducted for
the Star News TV channel has given the BJP-led National Democratic
Alliance (NDA) a big lead over the Congress in India's Lok Sabha
elections.
</P>
<P>
Telecast Tuesday night, the poll, conducted by "Insight" on
behalf of the news channel, gave the NDA 213 of the 344 seats
which have gone to the polls in the first three phases.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Congress and its allies finished far behind at
only 90, while the tally of other parties was put at 30.
</P>
<P>
This forecast, based on the biggest sample survey claimed by
any agency carrying out exit polls of about 125,000 voters spread
over 127 constituencies, is in complete contrast to those telecast
over Doordarshan and Jain TV recently. The projection is actually
for 333 seats out of the total 344.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to this rosy projection, another exit poll,
conducted by the Lokmat group of newspapers and released Tuesday,
gave the NDA only 169 out of the 344 seats.
</P>
<P>
It gave the Congress and its allies 159 seats -- by far the
best news for the Congress in any opinion poll thus far.
</P>
<P>
It said there is a 7.7-percent swing in favor of the Congress
as against only 1.5 percent for the NDA.

<HEADLINE> China to Select National Stone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Six kinds of beautiful
stone, one of which will be selected as China's national stone,
will be on display at the '99 Guangdong International Jewelry and
Rare Stone Exposition slated here next month.
</P>
<P>
The six types of stone, Hetian Jade, Dushan Jade, Youyan Jade,
Changdai Bloodstone, Shoushan Stone, and Qingtian Stone, were
selected by stone experts at a meeting earlier last month.
</P>
<P>
The criteria for the national stone are that it should have a
long history, is loved by the Chinese people at home and abroad,
and has commercial prospects, according to the stone experts.
</P>
<P>
They said that although China has many rare stones, it does not
have a national stone, which is considered as important as a
national flower in many countries.
</P>
<P>
The stone exposition set for October 16-20 in Guangzhou will
provide detailed introductions of the six stones to allow more
people to participate in selecting the national stone.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Launch New Language Teaching Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will launch a new
language teaching program from January 2000 in a bid to resolve
conflict among children of different ethnic groups in the war-torn
island country, the Education Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A ministry spokesman said that under the program the government
will recruit 6,500 teachers before December this year to teach
Tamil to Sinhala schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tamil teachers with a knowledge of Sinhala will be
requested to teach Sinhala to Tamil students for which they will
be granted an extra allowance, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said provincial education authorities have been requested to
submit reports giving details of volunteer teachers available.
</P>
<P>
Sinhala and Tamil are two major local languages in Sri Lanka,
spoken respectively by 74 percent and 18 percent of the country's
population.
</P>
<P>
The teaching of the mother language and English will commence
from grade 1 and the teaching of Sinhala and Tamil to other
communities from grade 3, according to the program.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to teach Sinhala to Tamil students and Tamil to
Sinhala students was made by the National Education Commission as
a means of national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 16-year-old war between the
Sinhalese majority-controlled government and Tamil Tiger rebels
who demand a separate homeland for minority Tamils in the north
and east of the country.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Earthquake Leaves 100,000 People Homeless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The strong earthquake that
rocked Taiwan Tuesday morning has left more than 100,000 Taiwanese
homeless, and rescue work is in full swing, according to media
reports monitored here this morning.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the powerful earthquake has killed more than 1,700
people, and injured over 4,000, with almost 3,000 believed trapped
in the rubble and another 216 missing, the reports said, quoting
Taiwan's disaster management center.
</P>
<P>
Most deaths are believed to be caused by the collapse of high
buildings, and the damage so far is estimated at some 100 billion
Taiwan dollars (about U.S. dollars 3.2 billion), according to the
reports.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Stock Exchange was closed for the second day today
due to power outages, but commercial banks and the foreign
exchange market were set to operate in Taipei.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 2.7 million, Taipei was spared much of the
damage, though the quake destroyed a 12-story hotel in the eastern
part of the city.
</P>
<P>
The quake was Taiwan's deadliest since a 7.4 magnitude tremor
hit the island in 1935, killing 3,276 people.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM orders Monitoring of Chemical Use, Storage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai has ordered five ministries to adopt a coordinated system
to monitor the use and storage of potentially explosive potassium
chlorate nationwide, the state-run Channel 9 reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chuan was quoted as saying on Tuesday that the Interior,
Agriculture, Science, Defense and Industry Ministries would
closely monitor the more than 1 million kilograms of potassium
chlorate currently in the hands of 116 private companies allowed
to possess and store the chemical in 29 provinces.
</P>
<P>
The order followed blasts in northern Thailand on Sunday and
it was reported that the number of people killed in the blasts in
a longan processing factory has risen to 35.
</P>
<P>
The 17,000 kilograms of potassium chlorate stored at the
factory is believed to have been the cause of the powerful
explosions, Chuan said. The factory had blown up because it had
not stored the substance correctly, he added.
</P>
<P>
Although potassium chlorate is a controlled substance under
the Military Supplies Act of 1987, the private sector is allowed
to import it. According to the act, importers have to store the
chemical in cool, dry storage sites which must be isolated from
any source of heat or ignition.
</P>
<P>
However, practical enforcement of the act is difficult, the
report noted.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide IT Workers Demand Exceeds Supply: IDC Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The shortage of
information technology (IT) workers currently stands at over one
million worldwide, and the problem will continuously intensify in
the next century, a report released here said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report released by a U.S. research firm, the International
Data Corporation (IDC), estimated that the shortage of skilled IT
professionals will exceed one million in Europe by 2002, when the
United States will experience intense recruiting for nearly 850,
000 IT employees.
</P>
<P>
"There are no signs that the intense competition for IT staff
will abate, making the 21st century a continuation of the late
1990s, " the report said. "By 2002, the number of openings for IT
workers could represent a number greater than one-fourth of 1998's
total IT workforce."
</P>
<P>
According to IDC, the shortage of IT talent has more to do with
lack of training and company attrition than to a quantitative lack
of qualified people in the IT industry. Companies that spend time
training individuals who do not have the exact technical skills
needed can gain a competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, IDC said, companies that lower their attrition
rates stand to cut their recruiting needs by as much as half. In
fact, attrition management will be the primary focus of human
resources management in the next decade, because the cost of
attrition is often far greater than the cost of recruiting.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Build One More Major Bridge Across River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is planning to build
one more major bridge across the country's mighty Ayeyawaddy River
at central Mandalay next to the existing Ayeyawaddy River Bridge
at nearby Sagaing which connects Mandalay and Sagaing divisions.
</P>
<P>
The planned construction of the Mandalay Bridge is aimed at
easing the daily traffic jam on the Sagaing Bridge which is a
vital link in the region, said Wednesday's official newspaper The
New Light of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The existing Sagaing Bridge was built in 1934.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Ministry of Construction is conducting feasibility
study and survey at the appropriate places to build the Mandalay
Bridge, the report said.
</P>
<P>
As Sagaing division was once struck by earthquake in 1956, the
authorities are looking for the possible situation of the faults
in marking the axis to build the bridge and design a modern
earthquake-resistant bridge, the report added.
</P>
<P>
There was only one bridge across Myanmar's Ayeyawaddy River in
the past. After 1988, three other bridges across the river were
built and opened in September 1997 and February and November 1998
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Two more bridges across the Ayeyawaddy River are under
construction and near completion.
</P>
<P>
The Ayeyawaddy River, which flows from north to south for a
distance of about 2,000 kilometers, is known as the rice bowl of
Myanmar with a delta area of some 33,657 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar has built 114 bridges
including 12 major ones from 1988 to 1999.

<HEADLINE> Romanian President Signs Law to Benefit Medium, Small Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Romanian medium and small
enterprises will enjoy a package of favorable policies on
approvement procedure, taxation and credit under a new law signed
by President Emil Constantinescu on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A press communique released by the presidential office said the
law provides a favorable legal frame for establishing and
developing medium-sized enterprises with less than 500 employees
and small-sized enterprises with less than 200 employees.
</P>
<P>
The examining and approving procedure for establishing a medium
or small enterprise will be simplified and must be completed
within 20 days, said the law.
</P>
<P>
Medium and small enterprises have priority in property
purchasing and project and service bidding in the reform of state-
owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The law defines many tax-reduction policies for medium and
small enterprises, such as a tax-free policy for importing
equipment, raw materials and techniques.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian government will set up special foundations to
guarantee loans for medium and small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Medium and small enterprises will also enjoy priority in
getting information about financial banks, enterprise
administration and market from the national information centers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are more than 600,000 medium and
small enterprises in Romania, most of which are private. Their
production and export value exceed half of the Gross Domestic
Product and the total export revenue of Romania.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Reports Rapid Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The economy has been growing
rapidly in northwest China's Qinghai Province over the past 50
years.
</P>
<P>
The province's gross domestic product (GDP) reached 22.04
billion yuan in 1998, a 42-fold increase over that of 1949 in real
terms, and the per capita GDP rose 12-fold since then, to 4,372
yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai has become one of China's important energy and chemical
industry bases. The Qaidam oil field is now the fourth-largest of
its kind in China, and more than 20,000 tons of chemical products
from Qinghai are sold to customers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The province had only two small power stations with a combined
generating capacity of one million kwh in 1949; at present, more
than 100 electric power stations in the province produce more than
seven billion kwh of electricity a year.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai now has more than 20,000 industrial enterprises with
total assets of 51.9 billion yuan, compare with 15 small factories
in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese People's Liberation Army marched into Qinghai and
overthrew the rule of Ma Bufang, a Kuomintang warlord, in
September 1949.

<P>
Editor's note: This year is the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the People's Republic of China. Xinhua News Agency is
releasing about 50 stories on Chinese men and women, young and old,
to illustrate the changes that have taken place in China over the
past half century. These people will describe their lives and how
they fit into the changes in the motherland. This is the 32nd
story in the series.
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- There are not many people in
this world who would celebrate their own misfortunes, past or
present, but Dai Shu, now a highly experienced pet veterinarian,
does.
</P>
<P>
For Dai, now 31, his teenaged dream was to work for an outlet
of the China Agricultural Bank like the one in his town in the
remote border area of southwest China, as he marveled at its
bright and elegant working environment and an easy way to make
chunks of money, compared with his parents who herded sheep on the
mountain top and grew rice at the foot of the mountains.
</P>
<P>
He opted to study agricultural economy when applying to enter
the Beijing Agricultural University (BAU) in 1986 to realize his
dream. But he never expected that he would eventually be enrolled
in the department of veterinarian science.
</P>
<P>
Today, he openly expresses his luck.
</P>
<P>
He now operates his own clinic, not catering to horses or cows
like the animals he studied in his university days, but rather
cats and dogs and even birds and tortoises.
</P>
<P>
To find customers, he has publicized his clinic on a weekly
Internet magazine. He also has his own web page (http://www.
beijingvet.com.cn/) and frequently checks his e-mail at (
beijingvet@263.net).
</P>
<P>
At the time Xinhua visited his clinic, he was transfusing some
liquid into a little white dog who looked rather weary and dirty.
To prevent the dog from biting people, Dai, a member of the 1.6-
million-strong Bai ethnic group form Dali in Yunnan Province, put
a lampshade-like plastic device around its neck. A young woman
dressed in a short skirt excitedly kept briefing him and Xinhua
one after another about her dear little dog.
</P>
<P>
Dai's mobile phone also beeped several times in the process. He
sometimes talked in quick, highly accented Putonghua, or Mandarin
Chinese, and sometimes in fast and fluent English.

<TEXT>
<P>
Dai said that he offers round-the-clock services and in urgent
cases like a dog vomiting blood, he leaves his home or his clinic
without hesitation. But his fees are probably among the highest in
Beijing. For a dog, he charges 100 yuan just for a checkup, and he
treats three to five dogs and cats a day, and also spends a lot of
time offering free consultations by phone.
</P>
<P>
Dai boasts of techniques for treating skin and eye diseases for
cats and dogs as well as ailments associated with aging, thanks to
his one and a half year's of study in the U.S. beginning in
September of 1996. These diseases are rarely mentioned in
textbooks of animal diseases in China.
</P>
<P>
He said the most of his cases involve the sterilization of cats
and dogs. These animals must be sterilized because then they will
live longer, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he also felt lucky to be treating animals because they
don't cover up their true feelings.
</P>
<P>
"A dog can instantly become active when I insert needles into
him," he said. "For humans, a doctor might be able to detect
responses from their faces even though they might be feeling much
better. A human is subject to strong psychological influences."
</P>
<P>
He treats pet animals not only in line with Western disciplines
but also uses acupuncture and Chinese herbal medicines.
</P>
<P>
He happily told Xinhua that he has just published a book on
treating bird diseases and that he is still working on a book
compiling pictures of all cats and dogs that have ever existed.
</P>
<P>
While he has greatly improved his fortunes by working as a pet
vet, he has also introduced this work to his sisters, who
otherwise would be working in the fields back home. One of his
younger sisters now works in a Hong Kong pet shop as a beautician.
She comes each Wednesday to her brother's pet clinic to beautify
dogs and cats. Dai's other younger sister has just joined him 11
days ago.
</P>
<P>
Dai said, "I asked her to come to Beijing to take a look (at
this national capital). Also I want to know if she can develop an
interest in caring for pets."

<P>
His second younger sister has a dark brown face and appears
rather shy in front of strangers. Raising his bespectacled fair-
skinned face, Dai said, "I look exactly like her when I first
arrived in Beijing."
</P>
<P>
Dai said that his experience treating pets goes back more than
12 years, when, as a sophomore, he earned 1.5 yuan for a night
shift in the veterinary hospital attached to the BAU.
</P>
<P>
After completing his bachelors and masters degrees, he remained
to work in the hospital until March this year. He first operated a
pet clinic with a partner, and recently decided to have his own. A
woman entrepreneur who has 16 dogs, also his long time customer,
offered him two rooms in her spacious yard and equipped it with
all the necessary equipment, tailor-made to his 1.69-m height.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that keeping pets has become a growing fad for the
expanding newly rich in China. "In 1989, the BAU veterinary
hospital treated five or six cats and dogs a day as compared with
three to four horses and cows," he recalled. "Now, the hospital
treats only one or two horses a month, but treats between 30 and
40 cats and dogs a day."
</P>
<P>
Fees ranged from three to four yuan for a cat and seven to
eight yuan for a dog ten years ago. Now these charges have grown
ten-fold, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the development of the pet trade owes a debt of
gratitude to the sustained development of the economy. In addition,
with the Chinese population now aging, the unique "one child,
four old people" family pattern also greatly propels the pet trade.
</P>
<P>
Dai also has his own two pets, one dog and one cat. He named
his dog "Benben," a common name Beijingers give their dogs, and
his cat is named "Barbie," an American name. The two animals were
both orphans left behind in his clinic by their masters.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Pollution Treatment Results to Be Publicized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 22 (Xinhua) -- The results of Beijing's
massive pollution control treatment is under inspection by the
State Environmental Protection Administration and the Ministry of
Supervision and will be publicized in three days.
</P>
<P>
The pollution treatment was launched by the Beijing Municipal
Government last December.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Guangtao, vice-mayor of Beijing, the
municipal government has enacted forceful measures to cope with
various sources and forms of pollution in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to make people in Beijing to enjoy a clear blue
sky," Wang said, quoting by today's China Daily. "For many years,
serious air pollution seemed to pack the whole city into a
stifling grey box. Many people felt uncomfortable and sick."
</P>
<P>
Since last winter, the city issued and enforced 18 emergency
measures to reduce air pollution, he said.
</P>
<P>
Coal burning, which accounted for 70 per cent of the city's
source of energy, is one of the major causes of air pollution in
Beijing, said Wang. "To date, 6,700 boilers and 21,000 stoves that
use coal as fuel have been renovated to use gas, electricity and
other clean energy."
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has adopted a policy to prohibit
pollution-causing emissions in new vehicles, he said, adding that
it has tightened treatment of vehicles currently in use, eased
traffic congestion and expanded public transportation.
</P>
<P>
"A new standard on automobile emission has been introduced this
year, similar to standard the European Union Began enforcing in
1992," he said.
</P>
<P>
To protect drinking water resources, the city has banned
tourism and the use of detergents containing chemical phosphorus
and pesticides in reserve areas, he added.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Chinese Province Getting Rid of Snail Fever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 22 (Xinhua) -- Snail fever used to claim
the lives of tens of thousands of people each year in Zhejiang
Province, east China, but not a single case has been found in the
past eight years.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, some two million people suffering from
snail fever have been cured of the disease in the province and 600
square kilometers of land have been cleared of oncomelania, a
fresh water snail that is the intermediate host of the blood fluke
that causes the disease.
</P>
<P>
Snail fever, or schistosomiasis, can cause severe organ damage
if it goes untreated, and victims suffer from liver, urinary, lung,
and nervous system disorders.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization reports that there are over 200
million people worldwide affected by the disease.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang began a massive campaign in 1955 as part of a national
effort to eliminate the disease. To check the spread of snail
fever, local people changed most rural lavatories and replaced 80
percent of the rural wells with tap water. Special research
institutes were also set up in the cities of Jiaxing, Hangzhou,
Quzhou, and other areas that have many rivers and lakes, to study
the disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian-
Venezuelan border has been blocked in Colombia's La Guajira
province, since businessmen and indigenous people obstructed the
area to protest against the restriction of selling illegal
Venezuelan petroleum in the past four days.
</P>
<P>
Traders and indigenous people have set up barriers on the
border area after Colombia's National Customs and Tax Division
confiscated 26 trucks loaded with Venezuelan petroleum to supply
the north-east of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan oil is sold at half the price of the Colombian
oil product in the black market in the border zones.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian Petroleum Company estimates that about 20,000
illegal barrels of Venezuelan petroleum are sold daily there.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the La Guajira province, Alvaro Cuello, proposed
that the Colombian Petroleum Company import the Venezuelan
petroleum directly and then deliver it to the local people and oil
traders.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian company announced Tuesday to send gasoline to La
Guajira to meet the demand of local people who are affected by the
protest.

has been enhanced greatly in the past years," Topfer stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has also conducted open, good and
friendly cooperation with UNEP," Topfer said.
</P>
<P>
On China's housing issues, Topfer, who is also acting executive
director of the U.N. Center for Human Settlements (Habitat), said
the ongoing reform on China's housing policy is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
"With the introduction of market elements into housing issue,
people are stimulated to save more money and more flats will be
built, the thorny problem of housing will be solved gradually," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Topfer also noted that China is an active partner in the global
Sustainable Cities Program (SCP), a joint program sponsored by the
Habitat and UNEP since 1996.

<HEADLINE> "La Nina" Hits Coast of Ecuador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Cold and drought, caused by "La
Nina", are hitting the coast of Ecuador, affecting agriculture and
people's health.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Oceanographic Institute of the
Ecuadorian Navy published on Tuesday, the low temperatures in the
coastal areas have caused the flowering crops to lose their
flowers, thereby lowering the quantity of fruit.
</P>
<P>
The climactic anomaly has also lowered the yield of other
agricultural products such as corn, soya and melon.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the cold has increased the presence of respiratory
illnesses such as colds, coughs, bronchitis and pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
However, the cold has obviously increased the catch of fishes
such as tuna, red snapper, catfish, albacore, corvina, shark,
various kinds of shellfish, but decreased the catch of marine
shrimps.
</P>
<P>
According to information obtained from the permanent monitoring,
the evolution of the cold spell makes it possible to confirm the
presence of the phenomenon of "La Nina" which may extend to the
early months of the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Pistons Acquire Guard Derek Harper from Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Detroit Pistons,
looking to add depth at point guard, acquired aging Derek Harper
from the Los Angeles Lakers for the rights to rookie forward
Melvin Levett on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The move comes one day after Detriot brought back free agent
forward Terry Mills, another veteran who played with the Pistons
from 1992-1997.
</P>
<P>
"Derek gives us the backup point guard we've been looking for,"
Detriot executive vice president and general manager Rick Sund
said. "He's been in the league for 16 seasons and has played at a
high level his entire career."
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Harper is tied with Eddie Johnson atop the
active list in games played with 1,119 and is the only player in
NBA history to register more than 16,000 points, 6,500 assists and
1,900 steals.
</P>
<P>
However, Harper's game has slipped in recent years and he
averaged just 6.9 points in 45 games for Los Angeles last season,
his lowest output since averaging 5.7 points as a rookie with the
Dallas Mavericks in 1983-84.
</P>
<P>
"He was brought to LA last season primarily as a backup and he
ended up starting more than half of their games," Sund said. "
Derek has been honored several times in his career for his defense
and he can contribute to this team."
</P>
<P>
Harper started 29 games but did not provide the leadership the
Lakers were looking for and lost his starting job down the stretch
to third-year guard Derek Fisher.
</P>
<P>
The addition of Levett continues Lakers vice president Jerry
West's recent trend of acquiring players from the University of
Cincinnati. The Pistons chose Levett 54th overall in the 1999
draft.
</P>
<P>
Harper, who has career averages of 13.3 points and 5.5 assists,
ranks seventh on the all-time steals list with 1,957 and 10th in 3-
point attempts with 3,026.
</P>
<P>
Among active players, Harper stands third in assists (6,577),
fifth in minutes played and 10th in shot attempts. He was named to
the NBA All-Defensive team in 1987 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
Selected 11th overall by the Mavericks in 1983, Harper also has
played with the New York Knicks, Orlando Magic and Lakers.

JAKARTA, September 22 (Xinhua) -- There are 6.07 million
illiterate Indonesians between the ages of 10 and 44, The Jakarta
Post Wednesday quoted an official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The director of non-formal schooling at the Ministry of
Education and Culture Endro Sumardjo said he hoped these people
could become literate by the year 2004 through intensive courses.
</P>
<P>
The ministry earlier stated that its goal was to bring this
number below 5 million by 1999, but the economic crisis made this
target impossible to reach, he said.
</P>
<P>
There were 6.9 million illiterate Indonesians in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Endro, however, expressed optimism that intensive language
courses could reduce illiteracy by 1 million people per year.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with local administrations, the ministry also
sponsors continuing education for those who have recently become
literate.

<HEADLINE> Daei Double Beats Chelsea in Champions League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- One goal in each half from
Iranian striker Ali Daei helped Hertha Berlin beat Chelsea 2-1 in
a Champions League group H match on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hertha, playing their first European match in front of their
own fans since their UEFA Cup semifinal exit to Red Star Belgrade
20 years ago, moved in front after two minutes when Daei headed
home from a Tony Sanneh cross.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea dominated the game in the second half but without
creating clear chances and in the 70th minute a mistake from
French defender Frank Leboeuf set up Daei for his second goal.
</P>
<P>
Bayern Munich was another team from Germany which remained
unbeaten in the Champions League with a last minute equalizer at
Ranger of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Bayern, who lost 2-1 to Manchester United in last season's
dramatic final in Barcelona after conceding two goals in the last
two minutes of the match, staged their own late revival at Ibrox.
</P>
<P>
An 89th minute shot from Michael Tarnat took a deflection off
his Paraguayan team mate Roque Santa Cruz, wrong-footed the
goalkeeper and gave Bayern a 1-1 draw with the Scottish champions
in Group F.
</P>
<P>
Including last week's matches, the four German teams Bayern,
Hertha Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen have now played six
matches in the Champions League between them and none of them have
lost a game with two wins and four draws.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the three English teams Manchester United, Arsenal
and Chelsea, have played four matches between them and have yet to
win a game after three draws and a defeat.
</P>
<P>
The other match in Group F also ended in a 1-1 draw between PSV
Eindhoven and Valencia, leaving Valencia and Bayern at the top of
the standings with four points from two matches and PSV and
Rangers both on one.
</P>
<P>
In Group H, AC Milan beat Galatasaray 2-1 to move on to four
points with Hertha. Both Galatasaray and Chelsea have one point
from their opening two matches.
</P>
<P>
Porto maintained their 100 per cent start in Group E with a 2-0
win over Olympiakos while Real Madrid crushed Molde of Norway 4-1
in front of only 15,000 fans at the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium --
the lowest crowd to watch a Champions League match there.
</P>
<P>
Porto, the only team to have played two matches and not to have
dropped a point or conceded a goal, have six points with Real on
four, Olympiakos on one and Molde none after two defeats.
</P>
<P>
Spartak Moscow top group G despite being held to a 1-1 draw at
home by Sparta Prague and having two players sent off.
</P>
<P>
Their 3-1 victory at Willem II Tilburg last week means they
edge Girondins Bordeaux, who also have four points after their
exciting 3-2 win over Willem II on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves Forward Smith Breaks Foot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Minnesota Timberwolves
forward Joe Smith could miss the start of the season after
undergoing surgery today to repair a broken bone in his left food.
</P>
<P>
The procedure was performed at the Minneapolis Sports Medicine
Center by team orthopedic surgeon Dr. David Fischer, who placed a
screw in the fifth metatarsal bone.
</P>
<P>
The top overall pick in the 1995 draft, Smith broke his foot in
a pick-up game at UCLA on Thursday. This summer, he re-signed with
the Timberwolves, inking a one-year, $2.2 million deal.
</P>
<P>
Training camp opens in early October and the 1999-2000 season
begins November 2. Smith's foot will be in a cast for one week and
he is expected to return in six to seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed that this happened to Joe after he worked
so hard this summer," We are disappointed that this happened to
Joe after he worked so hard this summer," Wolves coach and general
manager Flip Saunders said. "We are encouraged that the surgery
was a success and that he will be back around the time we start
the regular season."
</P>
<P>
Smith, 24, averaged 13.7 points and 8.2 rebounds last season,
his first with the Timberwolves. He teamed with superstar Kevin
Garnett at forward and helped Minnesota reach the postseason for
the third straight year.
</P>
<P>
Drafted by the Golden State Warriors, Smith averaged 15.3
points as a rookie and a career-high 18.7 points in the 1996-97
season. However he demanded a lucrative long-term deal and the
Warriors dealt him to the Philadelphia 76ers, who allowed him to
depart as a free agent following the 1997-98 season.

ROME, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D
'Alema announced Tuesday evening that the government intended to
put more money and manpower into fighting against violent crime.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after discussing an anti-crime package with his
cabinet, D'Alema also promised that authorities would soon begin
testing new security ideas such as an electronic bracelet for
convicted criminals on parole.
</P>
<P>
"The government is committed to improving the state's response
to crime through organizational changes," he said.

<P>
D'Alema said 500 billion lire (about 270 million U.S. dollars)
would be made available for extra police work and a further 6,000
law enforcement officers would be put onto Italy's streets.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government is scheduled to meet regional prefects
and local police chiefs next Monday in order to discuss the
measures it intends to take to confront crime.

city of Milan, the government came up with a draft law stiffening
penalties for violent crimes and giving police more powers to
pursue criminals.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Urges dialogue with Britain on Island Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Argentina said Tuesday
circumstances became ripe for a dialogue with Britain on a
definitive solution of the Malvinas (Falkland) Islands dispute.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that circumstances are now conducive for
Argentina and the United Kingdom to start without further delay"
such a dialogue, President Carlos Saul Menem told the 54th Session
of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He said the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between the
two countries in February 1990 opened a new stage for the creation
of bilateral ties at the highest level in history.
</P>
<P>
The event took place eight years after British troops occupied
the islands.
</P>
<P>
Menem said Argentina, "reaffirming its sovereignty rights and
urged by a spirit of reconciliation", has harmoniously worked with
Britain on different fields related to the South Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
They include the rebuilding of a climate of mutual trust in
the area, the preservation of live marine resources, the
exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons, the reestablishment
of flights between the continent and the Malvinas islands.
</P>
<P>
The President said Argentina's constitution "establishes as a
national goal the recovery of the Malvinas Islands and guarantees
that the way of life of their inhabitants will be strictly
respected".

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Revolutionary

for the death of Marco Emilio Londono, Mayor of Vistahermosa,
central-eastern of the country.

Vistahermosa is one of the five municipals of the demilitarized
zones created since November 7, 1998 for the peace talks by the

In the statement, the eastern block of the FARC denied what it
considered "slanderous accusation" made by the military chief.
</P>
<P>
Londono was assacinated last Sunday in Villavicencio, where he
had taken refuge after receiving death threats.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Popularity of Light Trucks A Trend in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 21 (Xinhua) -- If the market share of
light trucks was to maintain its growth rate of the past decade in
the United States, more than two in three new vehicles sold by
2010 would be trucks, said a market analysis report released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
For years, the family car in the United States was a sedan or a
station wagon. Now the family car is a truck, according to the
report from the Polk Company, a market analysis firm.
</P>
<P>
In 1970, U.S. automotive sales were comprised approximately 85
percent cars and 15 percent light trucks, Polk said. With the
popularity of the minivan in the 1980s, followed by the sport
utility vehicle in the 1990, several manufacturers now sell
primarily trucks. DaimlerChrysler, for example sold two trucks for
each car last year, while Ford and General Motors sold about 60
percent and 46 percent light trucks, respectively, in 1998. In
total, 47 percent of all vehicle sales last year were trucks.
</P>
<P>
Economic factors such as rising income and low fuel prices have
contributed to the popularity of trucks, according to Polk.
</P>
<P>
Lifestyle changes can also influence vehicle choice. The growth
of edge cities and remote suburbs put the modern family in more
rugged terrain for housing and hobbies, and the roads are a
challenge for small vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Another trend influencing the popularity of trucks is the
growth of multiple-vehicle households in the United States. The
number of people in a household remaining stable, combined with a
strong economy, has enabled the number of vehicles per household
in the United States to grow from 1.2 in 1960 to 1.9 in 1998. As a
nation, Polk said, the United States has moved from households
owning one car to households owning one car and one truck. This
increase in ownership translates into the sales figure to nearly
15 million vehicles that has occurred in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
The average family is likely to choose a car if they can only
own one vehicle, Polk predicted. However, there are increased
preferences for trucks when adding another vehicle. The attraction
may be the extra space for carrying passengers or cargo. The
average truck is also larger, more powerful and safer than the
average car.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Tropical Storm Harvey
reached southern Florida Tuesday with 50 mph winds, bringing heavy
rain, street flooding and tornada warnings.
</P>
<P>
Florida Governor Jeb Bush declared a state of emergency for 56
of 67 counties as the storm approached and schools closed in some
areas such as Tampa, Orlando and the Florida Keys, but no
significant damage was reported.
</P>
<P>
The storm, formed in the Gulf of Mexico, was expected to hit
near Tampa in central Florida. But a cold front pushed it
southward and it sliced across the southern tip of the Florida
peninsula toward the Atlantic Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The storm, which could produce storm surge flooding of up to 6
feet above normal in some places, was expected to cross Florida
and stay offshore as it heads north along the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
Five to 10 inches of rain were expected from the storm
forecast to come ashore near Naples, 150 miles south of
Clearwater, by Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, the southern peninsula of Florida is going to
get lots of rain and gust," said Stephen Baig, oceangrapher at

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Launch Prawn Breeding Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican fishing company
Quelimar has raised about 31 million US dollars to launch a
project for breeding prawns in the country's northern coast
province of Nampula by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The Quelimar manager, Martinho Xavier Cossa, said the company
has recently completed the assessment.
</P>
<P>
A source in the National Fisheries Directorate said that the
Mozambican government has defined the breeding of prawns as a
priority for development of the fishing sector.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's potential for the fishing of prawns on the open
seas is currently estimated at about 7,000 tonnes a year, with
170,000 hectares suitable for such business.
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted by the National Fisheries
Directorate, the Mozambican coast is home to the white, tiger, and
brown tiger prawns.
</P>
<P>
Prawns represent about 40 percent of the total value of
Mozambique's exports. Currently prawns earn the country about 80
million U.S. dollars a year, compared with 34 million dollars in
1986.

<HEADLINE> More S. Africans Lose Jobs Amid Gold Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- There were fewer people
in jobs in South Africa by the end of the first quarter of this
year than at the same time a year before with the gold mining and
construction industries the hardest hit, it was disclosed on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The South African Reserve Bank said in its latest quarterly
bulletin that at end of March the number of workers employed in
the regularly surveyed formal sectors of the economy outside
agriculture was down by 42, 000 or 0.8 percent from 12 months
before.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from the weakness of aggregate output growth, employment
was also constrained by constant pressures on domestic producers
to be more competitive in an increasingly integrated international
economy, continued increases in the cost of employing labor and
the progress made by government with containing the growth of the
public service and at the same time raising the quality of public
service delivery," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
"The impact of these employment-constraining factors moderated
somewhat over the past year and a half and job losses in the
private sector slowed down from 2.6 percent (seasonally adjusted
and annualized) in the third quarter of 1998 to 1.4 percent in the
fourth quarter.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The international

Colombia was the most dangerous country for the press in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
In a letter sent to Colombian Attorney General Alfonso Gomez,
Reporters Without Frontiers lamented the deaths by the bullet of

peace process in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)," he said.
"But the full implementation is a difficult process, it needs the
active participation of the international community and the United
Nations."
</P>
<P>
"It is our view that if the international community and the
United Nations, at the current stage, fail to invest necessary
material and manpower, the root course of the conflict can not be
addressed," he said. "The crisis would break out again, and we
would have to pay a higher, or even more tragic price."
</P>
<P>
"China has always attached importance to the question of
Africa, and we always supported the just demands and the
reasonable proposals by African countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We endorse the idea that African countries should make their
own efforts to maintain political stability and promote economic
development, and we always supported the African efforts in
strengthening their unity and regional cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at the meeting, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba,
who led the mediation efforts, briefed the Council on the
ceasefire accord in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
"China highly appreciated what has been done by President
Chiluba and his contribution to the question of DRC," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Breaks 50 Million Dollars Barrier in Fund Raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Republican
presidential front-runner George W. Bush has broken the 50 million
dollars barrier by raising more than 52 million dollars so far for
the 2000 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
His advisers said earlier this month that they expected
the Texas governor to beat the 50 million dollars mark by the end
of September.
</P>
<P>
Bush is requested to report his finance situation in fund
raising from the period of July 1 through September 30 to the
Federal Election Commission on October 15.
</P>
<P>
At the end of June, Bush had raised 37 million dollars and had
30 million dollars in the bank.
</P>
<P>
Bush's 52 million dollars is more money than any other
presidential candidate ever has had to spend on a campaign, even
including federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
Including the federal funds, 1996 Republican presidential
nominee Bob Dole had 45 million dollars to spend and President
Clinton had 43 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bush said that he would not accept federal funding, which would
require his campaign to limit its spending to around 40 million
dollars in the primaries.
</P>
<P>
By refusing the federal assistance, Bush can spend as much as
he can raise, allowing him to financially compete with publisher
Steve Forbes, who also is not accepting federal funds for his
largely self-financed campaign.

<HEADLINE> Albright Plans to Meet Syrian Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright planned to meet Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara on Wednesday in an effort to find a way to restart
long-stalled Syria-Israel peace negotiations, a U.S. official said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Albright would like to see "whether there can be a formula
established to restart the negotiations" when she meets the
Syrian foreign minister on the fringes of the annual opening of
the U.N. General Assembly where leaders and foreign ministers
from most countries converge on U.N. headquarters in New York,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
She will also "try to ensure that if the peace talks are
restarted, there will be an ability to move quickly through the
myriad issues," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official refused to predict how close Israel and Syria
are to resuming the peace negotiations. "It's an extraordinarily
difficult exercise," he said.
</P>
<P>
Albright was also scheduled to hold separate talks on
Wednesday with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
"We think they (Egyptians) are going to continue to play an
important role, especially in the permanent status talks"
between Israel and the Palestinians, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
sharply Tuesday because of the weakening dollar, the growing
U.S. trade deficit and the lower-than-expected earnings warning.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 225.43, or 2
percent at 10,598.47. The blue chip index fell as much as 272.03
during the trading.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 27.95 at 1,307.58 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 65.05 at 2,821.10.
</P>
<P>
The market plunged as the dollar continued to slide to 104.87
today from 106.38 Monday against the Japanese yen in New York,
which, investors feared, would prompt the Federal Reserve to raise
interest rates for the third time this year to fight inflation
because a weaker dollar can be inflationary.
</P>
<P>
A government report on high trade deficit also helped to
push the stock lower. The report said the U.S. trade deficit
rose to a monthly record of 25.2 billion U.S. dollars in July,
disappointing investors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Apple Computer announced late Monday that its
earnings for the third quarter would be hurt by a shortage of
chips. The announcement discouraged investors.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake in the Taiwan region also led a range of
semiconductor stocks to fall.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 11.11 at 600.99 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 7.87 at 784.98. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 6.70 at 426.50.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-3 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,362 down, 697 up and 492
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 785.33 million shares from 564.95
million in the previous session.
