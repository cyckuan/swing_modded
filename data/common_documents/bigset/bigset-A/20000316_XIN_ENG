<P>

swimming championships, which opens here Thursday, will have a
record entry of 563 swimmers from 73 countries and regions,
according to the organizers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Being the only major world swimming meet prior to the Olympic
Games, few of the top 10 FINA World Cup series athletes were
expected to attend the championships.
</P>
<P>
Swimming powerhouses like Australia said that they will be
sending teams consisting of young and relatively inexperienced
swimmers to the four-day meet.
</P>
<P>
China had named a 20-member squad which include veteran Zeng
Qiliang, the silver medalist in the men's 100 meters breaststroke
at the 1998 world championships, women's freestyle specialist Yang
Yu, who topped the 200m freestyle on the World Cup standings, and
Xie Xufeng, men's 100m and 200m individual medley No. 1 on the

<HEADLINE> Bangkok to Launch Bid Campaign in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok is expected to launch its
Olympic bid advertising campaign before Songkran festival, the
Thai new year starting on April 13, to boost public awareness
during the holiday period.
</P>
<P>
Olympic Committee of Thailand (OCT) President Chettha Thanajaro
said the Bangkok Bid Committee planned to use the campaign to
bolster public support for its bid for the 2008 Games, the Nation
newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chettha said the committee is trying to begin the campaign by
April 10, hoping that during the three-day holiday people will be
free and pay more attention to the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
The bid committee Tuesday launched a contest to design the logo
for the Bangkok campaign.
</P>
<P>
Once the logo is chosen on March 29, banners, billboards, flags
and hoardings will be placed in key spots in the city and major
provinces to attract public attention.
</P>
<P>
The ad campaign will also be posted on the Internet, and people
will be allowed to give their opinions regarding the bid.
</P>
<P>
The website is the only means by which Bangkok can promote its
bid overseas, as the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
prohibits all other types of international advertising before
September.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) and the Thai
government will each contribute half of the 82 million baht (2.17
million U.S.dollars) advertising budget to be spent between now
and August, when five finalists among the 10 applicants will be
announced.
</P>
<P>
If Bangkok is selected, it will need another 441 million baht (
11.67 million dollars) to continue the campaign until the winner
is announced in July next year.
</P>
<P>
Despite some strong criticisms about the huge investment, which
will be lost if Bangkok fails to get the IOC nod, Chettha said the
city would still gain from the bid, as it would boost the country'
s tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, the country has to spend over one billion baht (26.4
million dollars) to promote its tourism potential, while it takes
half that money to bid for the Games," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure our country will be more internationally known after
the bid and if we really win the Games, it will be the most
effective way to promote the country," he added.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Draws up Code of Ethics for Cabinet Members  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The South African cabinet on
 Wednesday finalized for submission to Parliament a code of ethics
for ministers and provincial executive councils.
</P>
<P>
The code provides for general standards of behaviour, potential
and real conflicts of interest, gifts and disclosure of financial
interests.
</P>
<P>
South African Education Minister Kader Asmal, who chaired the
committee which drew up the code, said that the code will ensure
members of the executive take care not to mix private interests
with their public duties.
</P>
<P>
The code should be seen as a cumulative process of laying down
standards of behaviour for public representatives, Asmal added.
</P>
<P>
The South African Parliament will discuss the code and submit
amendment proposals to the cabinet by June.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Govt Presents Five-Year Plan to Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi Wednesday presented the government's program for the
five-year period 2000- 2004 to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The program, whose major target is to reduce the country's
levels of absolute poverty by at least 30 percent, also aims to
achieve continued rapid economic growth based on the successes of
the previous five years, Mocumbi said.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that the government's plans had suffered "a
powerful blow" in February, with the floods and cyclone hitting
the southern and central parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
At least 492 people had lost their lives in the disaster, said
Mocumbi, while two million people were affected, one million of
whom were in need of emergency relief.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot count on the social contribution of these citizens,"
he said. "On the contrary, we have to support them so that they
can recover their capacity to participate in the economy."
</P>
<P>
That meant that the state budget and the Economic and Social
Plan for 2000 to be presented must be written to take account of
the floods.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts will be made to ensure humanitarian aid, to resettle
flood victims, to normalize their lives and to rebuild economic
infrastructures, so as to return to the situation prevailing in
late 1999," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mocumbi, economic development should be aimed at
"eradicating poverty, reducing imbalances between the country's
regions, and strengthening the national business sector."
</P>
<P>
The government would act so as to create "an economic
environment favorable to the development of a strong business
sector, able to act effectively and efficiently in the context of
the globalization and regionalization of the world economy," he
said.
</P>
<P>
This favorable environment involves "removal of red tape and
simplifying procedures, the establishment of a just and balanced
fiscal system, the maintenance of a good macro-economic climate,
the search for funding for productive activities, and the
safeguarding of the free functioning of the financial market," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said in the agro-industrial sector, the government proposes
"to guarantee the food security of the population, and to supply
raw material to national industry, thus contributing to import
substitution, to improving the country's balance of trade and to
expanding the national supply of manufactured goods."
</P>
<P>
According to Mocumbi, sustainable development should "rest on
the basic resources of the country." The country's ecosystems
should be protected, and environmental education promoted, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the military and to foreign affairs, Mocumbi said
the government gave "priority to the peaceful resolution of
conflicts", but thought it necessary to maintain "the persuasive
capacity of the country's armed forces."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Vows to Punish Violators of U.N. Sanctions Against UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Minister of South
African Foreign Affairs Department Aziz Pahad Wednesday pledged to
prosecute those who violated the United Nations sanctions against
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The relevant authorities have been ordered to investigate a
U.N. report issued on Wednesday identifying five South African
sanction busters in support of UNITA, Pahad told the Parliament in
his department budget debate in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the U.N. sanctions are of great importance in
bringing about a negotiated solution for the Angolan civil war.
</P>
<P>
"We will do everything possible to ensure that the sanctions
are effectively implemented. If evidence enables us to prosecute
the sanction busters, they must and will be prosecuted," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pahad lashed criticism from South Africa's
opposition United Democratic Movement that the South African
government has been involved in the sanction busting.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has fully cooperated with the U.N. special
committee which investigated the issue and drew up the report, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The South African government has not been accused by the U.N.
report of participating in violation against the U.N. sanctions,
he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Pahad, South African Mineral and Energy Affairs
Minister Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka and her Botswana and Namibian
counterparts will co- ordinate to draw up strict measures to make
it difficult for sanction busters to engage in illegal diamonds
trade with UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed arms, fuel, travel and diamond trade
embargo on UNITA in 1996 to cut off the supply to the Angolan
rebel movement.

<HEADLINE> ECB Raises Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 BERLIN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB)
Thursday decided to raise its three main interest rates by 0.25
percentage amid growing risk of inflation.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made at the bank's governing council meeting,
which was also attended by Romano Prodi, president of the European
Commission.
</P>
<P>
A press statement issued by the ECB said its top operating
rate, the interest rate on main refinancing operations, would be
raised 3.5 percent, with effect from March 22.
</P>
<P>
And the other two interest rates, namely the rate on the
marginal lending facility and the rate on the deposit facility,
will be raised to 4.5 percent and 2.5 percent respectively with
effect from 17 March.
</P>
<P>
It was the third time that the ECB raised its interest rates
in 15 months since the birth of the common European currency, the
euro. The central bank of 11 eurozone nations raised interest
rates in last November and this February.
</P>
<P>
Though economic conditions and prospects for the euro area"
appear to be better at present than at any time in the past decade,
", upside risks to price stability were seen "as a reason for
vigilance," said the ECB.
</P>
<P>
The bank cited two factors that might cause inflation: First,
the amount of currency in circulation has been growing in the euro
area over its projection. And the second, the rise in oil prices
and the drop in exchange rate of the euro are putting upward
pressure on import costs and producer prices.

<HEADLINE> Fischer Withdraws From Race to Head IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Acting Managing Director of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Stanley Fischer withdrew on
Thursday from the race to head the fund full-time, clearing the
way for Germany's Horst Koehler to sweep to an unopposed victory.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the emerging consensus behind the candidacy of Mr.
Horst Koehler, president, European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, I have asked Mr. de Morais to withdraw my nomination,
" Fischer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
IMF Executive Director Jose Pedro de Morais, who represents 20
African countries including South Africa and Zambia where Fischer
was born, nominated last month Fischer as a candidate for the IMF
chief.
</P>
<P>
"I had an excellent meeting this morning with Mr. Koehler,
during which we discussed the challenges the fund faces," said
Fischer, adding that "I am confident that under his leadership the
fund will become an even more effective institution."
</P>
<P>
Fischer's withdrawal is one of the final stages in what has
been a prolonged and ugly battle to find a new boss for the IMF,
which provides billions of dollars in loans for financially
troubled countries around the world.
</P>
<P>
During four months of diplomatic arguments, Europe doggedly
insisted the job should go to a European and Germany stubbornly
said it was its turn to run a major lending institution. But the
United States rejected Europe's first candidate, prompting a
fierce transatlantic dispute.

<HEADLINE> Open Skies Law Passed in Honduras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign airlines will enter
freely the Honduran air space after the approval in the Congress
of this country of an Open Skies Law, to end with the monopoly of
the airlines that operate between Central America and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Tegucigalpa say that the law passed
Wednesday night will eliminate the restrictions for any foreign
airline interested in flying routes in Honduras, where the TACA
airline was the only one authorized to fly between Tegucigalpa and
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The monopoly maintained by the Central American TACA group was
the target of many complaints from the passengers in relation to
the poor services and the frequent cancellation of flights without
previous warning and the loss of baggage, among others.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, the flights between the United States and Tegucigalpa
are made by American Airlines and Continental, besides TACA, while
COPA of Panama and LACSA of Costa Rica fly between the northern
city of San Pedro Sula and their respective capitals.
</P>
<P>
The Mexicana de Aviation airline has stated its plans to
operate in a short time in Honduras, given the situation the
sector is going through, said recently Civil Aeronautics Director
Luis Rolando Leiva.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Housing Starts Up in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The country's housing starts
on new homes and apartments rose to the fastest pace in 13 months
in February as higher mortgage rates did little to damp demand,
the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Total starts rose 1.3 percent in February to a seasonally-
adjusted annual rate of 1.78 million units, up from a 1.76 million
pace in January. Economists had forecast a slowdown to 1.687
million units.
</P>
<P>
During the first two months of this year, the total starts
increased 2.5 percent to 225,800 units from the 220,200 units for
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The data was further evidence that the four credit tightening
by the Federal Reserve since mid-1999 have had little impact, even
on one of the most interest-rate sensitive sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Most economists expect the Federal Reserve to raise the
interest rates for the fifth time at its meeting next Tuesday to
slow economic growth and keep inflation under control.

<HEADLINE> Angola Calls to Punish Violators of U.N. Sanctions Against UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government issued a
statement here on Thursday to support the United Nations report on
the implementation of U.N. sanctions against Angolan rebels,
calling on it to punish those violating the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
As it is confirmed in the report issued on Wednesday, there are
still some countries in the world which continue to offer support
and fund to the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) to enable the rebel group to buy arms for further
civil war, Angolan Foreign Ministry said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
This "criminal act" not only interferes with the internal
affairs of Angola but also impedes the peace process of the
war-torn country, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry urged the United Nations, an organization
dedicated to maintaining world peace and development, to punish
those which acted against its resolutions.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the U.N. expert group has made a suggestion
in the report to suspend the violators' membership in the U.N. and
other international and regional organizations.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they should not be allowed to host any international
conferences, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. report, Belgium was accused of allowing
UNITA to illegally trade diamonds in the country while Bulgaria
and Ukraine were charged of selling a large amount of weapons to
the Angolan rebels.
</P>
<P>
The report also enlisted Togo, Burkina Faso and Rwanda as
violators of U. N. sanctions against Angolan rebels.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Hosts 220,000 Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is now hosting a total of
220,000 refugees, according to the latest information obtained
from United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee (UNHCR) here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Solange Senaize, program officer for UNHCR, told Xinhua that
more than 6, 000 Angolan refugees have already been transferred to
a new camp in Nangweshestern Province, while about 4,000 more are
still residing in the border town of Sinjembela, awaiting their
turn to be ferried by truck to the new camp.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the transfer of the Angolan refugees from
Sinjembela is that the security within the border area is not good
and the Zambezi flood is making it more and more difficult to have
access to the area, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the transferring work is being undertaken by the
International Organization for Migration with the close
collaboration of UNHCR and the Zambian government.
</P>
<P>
According to Senaize, UNHCR still remains on alert following
reports of renewed clashes in Angola's Moxico Province, which may
prompt further refugee movements into Zambia's North-Western
Province.

<P>
LUSAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Saudi Arabia based Islamic
Bank for Development has pledged to invest heavily in the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) to strengthen
economic cooperation, the Times of Zambia newspaper reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted COMESA Secretary General Erastus Mwencha as
saying that discussions on the bank's willingness to invest in the
region have entered an advanced stage and would be completed as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Bank has also agreed to offer lines of credit to
the business community in the COMESA region at very low interest
rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Saudi Arabian interest rates are very competitive
and would greatly benefit the COMESA business community which has
always wanted to borrow investment capital from lending
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The other area the Islamic Bank is interesting to participate
is the development of agro industries with an aim of exporting
products to the Middle East, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the bank would also finance the development of a number
of economic infrastructure in the region.

Assembly (Parliament), Nizamettin Sevgili, has died of heart attack

in Mecca when preforming Haj, reported the Anatolia News Agency on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sevgili, a deputy of the Motherland Party, one of the three
ruling parties in the government, suffered the heart attack
Wednesday
in Arafat Valley, which is one of the most important places for
pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
He was rushed to a field hospital of the Red Crescent for

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Leader Vows to Abide by April Understanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of Hezbollah, or
Party of God, Hassan Nasrallah on Thursday pledged to abide by the
April Understanding and back the resumption of the April
Understanding Committee meetings.
</P>
<P>
Convening the committee meetings was an effective mechanism to
have the understanding maintained, said Nasrallah in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The April Understanding was reached in April 1996 to end a
flare-up between Israel and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas
in south Lebanon which claimed the lives of more than 150 Lebanese
people in Israel's 16-day "Operation Grapes of Wrath."
</P>
<P>
Under the ceasefire agreement, a monitoring committee,
comprising the United States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel,
was set up to make sure that the ceasefire understanding would be
honored.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss on Wednesday
evening discussed with a senior U.S. diplomat in Lebanon the
situation in south Lebanon and the need to restart the April
Understanding committee meetings.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its northern territories from
cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war to
oust Israeli troops and its proxy South Lebanon Army (SLA) from the
country.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said that Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon,
should make efforts to rein in the Hezbollah guerrillas if it is
serious about negotiating peace. Syria blamed Israel for the
escalation of conflicts in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet has approved earlier this month plans by
Prime Minister Ehud Barak to withdraw Israeli troops from south
Lebanon by July, with or without a peace agreement with Syria.

<HEADLINE> UK Shops Sale Slide In February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- February retail sales in Britain
slipped 1.2 percent, the biggest monthly fall in sales since June
1998, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
The fall means that the annual increase in sales slipped from a
revised 6.3 percent in January to 4.7 percent. It took most City
economists by surprise, they had expected a drop of just 0.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales grew by 1.8 percent in the three months to February
compared with the previous quarter, a record high from May 1997,
which was also posted in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
However, the ONS cautioned that the three-month growth figures
were artificially boosted by millennium-related spending.
</P>
<P>
"February will tell you more about what's going on than January
or December," said an ONS official. The underlying trend is "much
the same as October and November," he added.

<HEADLINE> Somalis Celebrate Religious Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Somalis Thursday widely
celebrated the main Muslim festival of Eid Al-Ad-ha which marks
the end of the Holy Hajj journey in Mecca of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
In the capital city of Mogadishu, children in colorful dresses
wandered throughout the streets, blowing whistles and firing toy
guns while the elderly gathered in the main mosques.
</P>
<P>
The largest gathering for the Eid prayer was held in the main
stadium of the capital where the former strong religious leader,
Sheikh Ali Dhereh, has been the Imam.
</P>
<P>
After the prayer attended by the main scholars of the capital
and the chiefs of the Islamic courts and politicians, Dhereh spoke
about the importance for the Somalis to forgive each other.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous Muslim festivals, Thursday's Eid Al-Ad-ha was
so especial that no single group opposed to its convening.
</P>
<P>
The Arab-funded aid agencies distributed thousands of goats and
oxen to the poor families of the capital for the occasion of the
Holy Muslim festival.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, the well-off families slaughtered goats and sheep
and distributed the meat to their neighboring poor families and
individuals so as to mark the Eid Al-Ad-ha.
</P>
<P>
However, the Holy Eid has not been without trouble.
Unidentified gunmen Wednesday night attacked a large garage in
Gubta area of South Mogadishu where over 100 oxen to be
slaughtered for the poor people on Thursday were being kept.
</P>
<P>
According to an eyewitness, the perpetrators of the attack used
two battle wagons and nearly 50 heavily armed infantry men for
their attack.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen surrounded the garage and opened fire on the
security guards of the premises, the eyewitness said.
</P>
<P>
The security guards of the garage, though smaller in number
than the attackers, returned fire. The deafening exchange of
gunfire was heard throughout the city, but on one came out to help
the garage under the attack.
</P>
<P>
In the end, the attackers managed to overrun the security
guards and took away 80 oxen with them including four wounded ones
hit by bullets during the exchange of the gunfire, the eyewitness
said.
</P>
<P>
No one has reportedly been killed, but an eyewitness in the
area confirmed that one of the security guards of the garage was
wounded. It is not known whether the attackers sustained any
fatalities.

<HEADLINE> Barak Appoints Committees for Lebanon Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has appointed two separate committees to deal with an Israeli
troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon due to be finished by July,
Israel Radio said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two committees will separately handle the civilian and
military aspects of the withdrawal, the report said. The cabinet
will discuss the recommendations made by the committees later this
month, it added.
</P>
<P>
In a landmark decision earlier this month, Barak's cabinet
reaffirmed one of his key promises by deciding to withdraw Israeli
troops from a border zone which Israel set up 15 years ago in
southern Lebanon by July, with or without a peace agreement with
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which resumed late December
after a four-year freeze, broke off in January over the fate of the
Golan Heights, a strategic plateau seized by Israel in the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Syria insisted that Barak make a commitment to withdraw fully
from the Golan Heights before the two sides move on to other
issues. Israel rejected the demand.
</P>
<P>
But Barak changed his tone late last month, acknowledging for
the first time that several previous Israeli governments had agreed
to give up the whole Golan in exchange for security arrangements
and normalization of ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
By saying he "would not throw the past away," Barak suggested
that he might concede to the Syrian territorial demand in future
talks.
</P>
<P>
It is widely speculated that the two sides would resume their
talks in a matter of weeks. U.S. President Bill Clinton, a key
mediator for the talks, has said that he would like to see a final
deal be sealed in May.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said she is confident the Middle East peace process will
attain its goals through sincere and incessant efforts.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulatory letter to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on the occasion of Eid al-Adha, the Muslim Feast of Sacrifice,
Albright said continued efforts in this regard will make the common
aspiration for peace within reach.
</P>
<P>
Albright also praised Arafat for his endeavor toward realizing a
just and comprehensive peace in the region, which she said helps
bring about a bright future for the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian and Israeli leaders have agreed to resume talks
in Washington after the Muslim holiday, to discuss the final status
issues in order to work out a framework agreement in May and
complete a final accord in September.
</P>
<P>
The thorniest issues to be tackled include Jerusalem, Jewish
settlements, borders, refugees and water. The two sides missed a
February deadline due to disputes over phrased Israeli troop
withdrawal from the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Surge in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Wholesale prices surged 1
percent in February, the largest gain in nearly 10 years, as
gasoline, home heating oil and other energy costs took a huge leap,
the Labor Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 1 percent increase in Producer Price Index, which measures
inflation pressures before they reach the consumers, was the worst
showing since a 1 percent gain in October 1990 and much higher
than the 0.6 percent many analysts were expecting.
</P>
<P>
The jolt came from a whopping 5.2 percent rise in energy costs,
the biggest jump since a 7.5 percent increase in October 1990.
Gasoline prices rose 12.9 percent, the biggest gain since a 23.7
percent rise in April. Home heating oil shot up 30.6 percent, the
largest rise since a record 37.7 percent increase in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, total food costs rose 0.4 percent in February as a
record rise in egg prices eclipsed falling prices for chickens,
turkeys and fresh vegetables.
</P>
<P>
In January, wholesale prices, helped by the a sharp drop in
cigarette prices, showed no increase despite another big jump in
the price of home heating oil and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the "core"
rate of inflation at the wholesale level rose 0.3 percent, on
target with many analysts' expectation. That was the biggest rise
in the core since September and reflected a hefty 6.3 percent jump
in cigarette prices. Excluding cigarettes, the core would have
shown no change.
</P>
<P>
In January, core inflation fell 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the Labor Department said the number of
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week
fell by an unexpected 19,000 to 262,000, the lowest level since
December 1, 1973.
</P>
<P>
Economists consider claims below 300,000 an indication of a
tight labor market, meaning employers are having trouble finding
qualified workers. Economists worry that employers will attract
workers by giving them big boosts in wages and benefits, increased
costs that companies could pass along to consumers in the form of
sharply higher product prices, thus sparking inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has bumped up interest rates four times
since June to slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation from
escalating. Economists widely expect the central bank will boost
rates for a fifth time when policy-makers meet next on Tuesday and
said Thursday's report would justify such a move.

<P>
OTTAWA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Canadian members of parliament
ended second reading of Bill C-20 early Wednesday after a
protracted debate of more than 30 hours since Monday.
</P>
<P>
Only two of the proposed 411 amendments to the controversial
bill passed during the marathon voting session.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the two amendments, the country's aboriginal
will enjoy a say on whether referendum results give Quebec the
right to secede from Canada.
</P>
<P>
A third reading is yet to be called before the bill is finally
adopted as federal referendum legislation, which will make
separation of Quebec from Canada ever more difficult.
</P>
<P>
All but eight amendments came from the Bloc Quebecois, which
tried to stall the bill by proposing as many as 403 amendments for
debate.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal government tabled the bill in December to enshrine
into law a 1998 Supreme Court decision which requires Quebec must
win a clear majority from a clearly-worded question before it can
separate from Canada.

<HEADLINE> Amalgamation Causes Headache of Renaming Canadian Streets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- City amalgamation has caused a big
headache of renaming hundreds of streets, the Ottawa Citizen
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At least 500 streets involving 14,000 addresses in Ottawa alone
will have to change their names by January 1 to avoid duplication,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
There are six Church Streets, five Albert Streets and five Main
Streets, for example, under the new amalgamated city of Ottawa.
The situation will give rise to a potential nightmare for an
emergency dispatcher taking a fire or ambulance distress call,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
"This has the potential to be a hornet's nest," Ottawa Mayor
Jim Watson was quoted as saying. It is so complex that "every body
wants to keep their name. It is heritage, it is pride, it is
history. It will be quite a battle to do this," said Cumberland
Mayor Gerry Lalonde.
</P>
<P>
It costs money as well. A street sign costs 100 Canadian
dollars(about 68 U.S. dollars), while overhead signs on regional
roads cost up to 1,000 (about 682 U.S. dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Renaming Streets is the responsibility of the city transition
board, which will name a panel of experts soon to study the issue,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Toronto amalgamated in 1998 to become the country's biggest
city, where street-name changes have just been dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Kingston will have to get its renaming blueprint ready for this
spring, also as a result of amalgamation in 1997.

LONDON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Britain will withdraw about 500
soldiers from Northern Ireland due to improving security, the head
of the British province's police said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A battalion from the Prince of Wales Own Regiment,responsible
for patrolling in Belfast will return home next month, reducing
the number of soldiers stationed in Northern Ireland to below 14,
000.
</P>
<P>
"This decision has been taken only after the most careful
consideration and assessment of the current security situation,"
police Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This further reduction in military numbers is welcome but is
one that can be quickly reversed and the troops returned within
hours, should the situation demand this," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Irish Republic had called for Britain to scale
back its troops in Northern Ireland, saying the move would help
reinvigorate a peace process stalled over the issue of guerrilla
disarmament.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Nepali PM Resigns Under Increasing Pressure  By Zhuang Meijie, Song Dejun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Nine months after coming into
power, Nepali Prime Minister announced Thursday that he was going
to resign.
</P>
<P>
"As I am too old to lead the country to a better development, I
decide to resign the office of prime minister, and I hope my
successor will do a better job than I," the 76-year-old Krishna
Prasad Bhattarai told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The announcement is surprise to none, as the prime minister has
been under pressure from within the ruling Nepali Congress (NC)
for him to step down ever since the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The pressure came, to be exact, from NC president G.P. Koirala,
an arch rival of Bhattarai in NC. The two have been engaged in a
decade-old squabbling over power.
</P>
<P>
Since Bhattarai was appointed as prime minister in May, 1999,
after NC won the general election, the gap between the two leaders
has been widening.
</P>
<P>
Koirala also accused the prime minister of failing to show any
leadership qualities and turning out to be a weak leader of a
government that has not made any progress. Many of his ministers
were alleged to be indulging in corruption and unethical behaviors.
</P>
<P>
In last December, 70 pro-Koirala NC lawmakers rebelled against
the prime minister and launched a signature campaign, asking
Bhattarai to step down as the party's parliamentary leader and the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
After a closed-door bargaining, an agreement was reached
between the two leaders, in which Bhattarai agreed to step down
around May this year, thus defusing the tensions inside the NC
party.
</P>
<P>
However, when Bhattarai made the last-minute effort to save his
position by appointing Ram Chandra Poudel as the deputy prime
minister in early February, the Koirala camp accused Bhattarai of
going back on his promise of a peaceful exit and launched another
round of no-confidence campaign on February 16, pressing for
Bhattarai's immediate resignation.
</P>
<P>
Following the suit, five ministers, three ministers of state
and three assistant ministers of the Bhattarai cabinet submitted
their resignation as a move of support for Koirala, further
weakening Bhattarai's position.
</P>
<P>
Under the increasing pressure, Bhattarai had to make a
commitment to quitting his job in early March following the
convening of the Winter session of the Parliament. But at the same
time, he was making the last effort to avoid the fate of an early
exit.
</P>
<P>
On March 10, Bhattarai reshuffled his cabinet by reassigning
the ministries left vacant, a move which triggered a third round
of no-confidence campaign by 69 pro-Koirala lawmakers, who became
even more determined to oust Bhattarai from the office.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the NC parliamentary party had been slated on
March 17 to vote on the no-confidence motion and decide whether to
let Bhattarai continue the leadership or to remove him from the
office.
</P>
<P>
Coming at the end of his wits and anticipating an unwanted
result, Bhattarai chose to make a voluntary quit to avoid a
disgraceful oust.

Compared with the previous month, the retail index in January
2000 was up 14.9 percent with the estimated total sales value
increasing to 2.89 billion Singapore dollars (about 1.69 billion U.
S. dollars) from the 2.52 billion Singapore dollars (about 1.47
billion U.S. dollars) in December 1999, the STS said.
</P>
<P>
Excluding motor vehicles, the index in January was down 1.5
percent against the previous month, STS added in the statement.

<HEADLINE> Green Lung to be Built in Phnom Penh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Phnom Penh authorities are
determined to make the banks of the Tonle and Bassac rivers on the
side of the city the main green lung of the capital of Cambodia in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Phnom Penh authorities made this ambitious decision recently
with the purpose of regaining Phnom Penh's former reputation as
the garden city of Southeast Asia. The plan would be submitted to
the prime minister and involves various sectors for endorsement,
state news agency AKP reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the banks stretching for about six kilometers
from the Japan-Cambodia Friendship bridge on the Chroy Changva end
to the Monivong bridge at the start of the national route no. one
are to be reinforced, planted with trees and shrubs, paved and
provided with lighting posts of traditional design.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, squatters, generally blamed for pollution in
the area by discharging waste into the rivers, are to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
The route is expected to provide an almost-circular road link
on the western part of the city, helping vehicles bypass downtown
Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the total cost of the project would reach
about 25 million U.S. dollars excluding costs for dredging the
rivers to speed water flow and prevent flash floods during the wet
season.
</P>
<P>
The project would help ease traffic jam in the city center,
provide more business for petty traders and improve the over-all
environment.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen members of the separatist
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and two government soldiers
were killed Thursday in the southern Philippines as new fighting
broke out between them, a local TV station said in a report.
</P>
<P>
According to the TV report, five soldiers and at least 20
rebels were also wounded in the clashes in four separate towns in
Lanao del Norte province in Mindanao
</P>
<P>
The report quoted military sources as saying that the fighting
began when about 200 MILF guerrillas tried to overrun an army
outpost at daybreak in the village of Inudaran in Kauswagan, Lanao
del Norte province.
</P>
<P>
Military sources said reinforcements held back the attackers at
Inudaran, but five other outposts in the towns of Bacolod, Linawon
and Boaloi were then attacked by MILF guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The report said the army has deployed 1,800 men in the four
towns to fight back the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has been fighting for an independent state in Mindanao
island during the past two decades.

<HEADLINE> New Delhi Claims to Have Averted Terrorist Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- New Delhi police Thursday
claimed to have averted a planned terrorist strike in the Indian
capital with the arrest of three members of an extremist group and
the recovery of a large cache of arms and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Just three days before the scheduled arrival of U.S. President
Bill Clinton for his seven-day South Asian tour, the police
announced that they had solved, among others, the bomb blast last
month near New Delhi railway station and another blast in a luxury
bus in the northwest state of Punjab on March 2.
</P>
<P>
The accused, identified as Sukhdev Singh, area commander of
Khalistan Zindabad Force, Purshotam alias Kala, deputy chief of
the group and their associate Satbir Singh, were arrested in
northwest Delhi, city police commissioner Ajai Raj Sharma told
reporters here.
</P>
<P>
A total of 32 kilograms of explosives, four hand grenades, one
Pakistan made pistol, one extra magazine, 63 live cartridges, five
timers, 15 detonators, three pencil timers and four nine volt
batteries had so far been recovered from their possession, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he ruled out that the accused had any plans to create
disturbance during Clinton's visit, which will formally begin next
Tuesday following his one-day visit to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Security in the capital has been tightened and the police,
along with a large team of U.S. security officials, have been
inspecting all places where Clinton may visit.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, Bhutan End Talks on Bhutanese Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The foreign secretary level
talks between Nepal and Bhutan on the Bhutanese refugees concluded
here Thursday without major breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
The four-day talks discussed issues relating to verification
process, such as the terms of reference, pro-forma and modalities
for joint verification and composition of the verification team,
according to a press release issued here by the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Some common grounds have been prepared and understanding
reached on the verification process regarding the joint
examination of documents, printing of the pro-forma, sharing costs,
outlining of the work procedure of the verification team, the
press release said.
</P>
<P>
The differences that persist between the two countries on a few
key issues have been narrowed down, including the basic unit of
verification, determination of the authenticity of the documents
for identification of the refugees and creation of an appeal, the
release added.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-level talks are a continuation of the official
level meeting held last month in Thimpu to prepare groundwork for
the next round of the ministerial joint committee meeting in an
effort to resolve the problem of the 100,000 Bhutanese refugees
living in eastern Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Eight rounds of ministerial talks have so far failed to reach
any agreement on repatriating the refugees who were evicted from
Bhutan in early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Will Bangladesh Agree to Export Gas?  By Chen Jian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- During U.S. President Clinton's
wind-whirling visit to Bangladesh on March 20, the issue of gas
export will feature prominently on the itinerary of his short stay.
Actually it worked as the major catalyst to Clinton's visit,
though the United States dismissed the notion.
</P>
<P>
Will Bangladesh then agree to open its gas sector, in other
words, agree to export its gas to any other country during Clinton
's visit?
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in a recent
television program, said Bangladesh would consider the
possibilities of exporting gas only after becoming sure that it
had a reserve for its own for 50 years. According to official
estimate, the current proven deposit of gas in the country is 13
trillion cubic feet, which will be exhausted in 35 years under the
current reserve-to-production ratio. Other senior government
officials held similar opinion, and they suggested to set up power
plants or fertilizer plants based on natural gas instead of gas
export.
</P>
<P>
The major opposition parties also took similar stand on gas
export.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Nationalist Party Secretary General Abdul Mannan
Bhuiyan Wednesday put up his party's proposal concerning the
natural resources, which includes determining the actual deposit
of gas both in the discovered and undiscovered fields, fixing up
the actual demand of gas consumption in domestic industries,
households and power generation for the next 50 years, not leasing
out all the gas fields at a time and also keeping prospective gas
blocks reserved for state-owned Petrobangla for exploration.
</P>
<P>
As to the international oil companies (IOCs), however, they
believe no gas for exports means no exploration. As gas
exploration is an expensive proposition, they would like to know
about the prospects of selling regarding the recovery of their
investment and profit-making.
</P>
<P>
Under production sharing contracts (PSCs) signed so far between
the Bangladeshi government and the IOCs, they are to sell gas to
the state-owned Petrobangla only and not to any other country. The
gas price is determined by the quarterly average price of High
Sulfur Fuel Oil in Singapore market under the Gas Purchase and
Sales Agreement. And the current level of very high petroleum
price has already affected Petrobangla adversely.
</P>
<P>
Petrobangla is facing financial problem to meet its commitment
and has sought relief from its debt servicing liability and value-
added taxes to tide over the situation. This has clearly
demonstrated that Bangladesh will find it difficult to purchase
its own natural gas from the IOCs unless it is able to raise its
export earnings substantially by exporting gas through pipeline.
As gas exploration is an expensive proposition, it could not
afford to explore without foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
What about establishing gas-based industries and exporting
their products to earn foreign currency and pay the IOCs for
buying gas from them? Citing a U.S. study, Forrest E. Cookson,
president of the American Chamber in Bangladesh said Bangladesh
might get 1.50 U.S. dollar by exporting 1,000 cubic feet gas
through pipelines. On the other hand, the export of power with the
same volume of gas would earn the country 1.25 dollar, fertilizer
0.60 dollar and liquefied natural gas only 0.40 dollar, after
deducting the cost of production. So these projects would
eventually not be cost-effective, and Bangladesh is almost
certainly "better off in sending it in pipeline" than the other
options, Cookson said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies, including Unocal from the United States,
engaged in gas exploration in Bangladesh, roughly estimated that
the deposit would be from 30 trillion to 50 trillion cubic feet,
which could easily meet the domestic demands for the next 50 years.
And the U.S. business leaders pledged to invest 600 million
dollars a year if Bangladesh decides to export gas to India
through pipelines. Recently, they even come up with a new proposal
that Bangladesh could invest on hydroelectricity in Nepal and
Bhutan to get hydropower at a cheap price in exchange of exporting
gas, saying that donors and international business circle would
naturally be interested in providing assistance for such an
integrated project under a regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Wednesday that
"with right policies in place, Bangladesh could make a quantum
leap forward by exploiting its vast energy reserves, particularly
in natural gas." She opined that American companies could be the "
perfect partners to help seize such opportunities."
</P>
<P>
Under the dual pressure from the U.S. government and the IOCs,
Bangladesh will feel it difficult to stand firm on its previous
position. Opening gas sector is only a matter of time. However,
considering the domestic pressure, The Bangladeshi government won'
t make decision hastily during Clinton's visit to allow gas export.
It will sign new production sharing contracts with some other IOCs
first, and the opening-up of the gas sector will be done in phases.

<HEADLINE> China Attaches Importance to Relations with India: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to India
Zhou Gang said here Thursday that China attaches importance to its
relations with India and is ready to establish a cooperative and
constructive partnership into the future with India on the basis
of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence.
</P>
<P>
"It is China's consistent and rock-firm aspirations, not an
expedient," Zhou, who was invited to deliver a speech on Sino-
Indian relations by the India-China Journalists Friendship
Association, told an audience of around 50 at the Press Club of
India in downtown Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's speech was also part of a series of celebrations to mark
the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties
between China and India, which falls on April 1.
</P>
<P>
As the two biggest developing countries, China and India share
similar or identical views on and extensive common interests in a
series of major international and regional issues, noted Zhou.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, it is not only necessary, but also possible for
China and India to strengthen friendly relations and cooperation
in the new century," he said. "This is in conformity with the
fundamental interests of the people of the two countries, and also
conducive to stability and development in Asia and the world at
large."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese side is pleased to see that the Sino-
Indian relations, following temporary setbacks, have gradually
returned onto the track of restoration and improvement since the
beginning of last year. The Chinese side is also expecting the
state visit to China by Indian President K.R. Narayanan, he added.
</P>
<P>
"I firmly believe that our bilateral relations ... will enjoy
broad prospects for further development," he said in conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a reporter's question about China's position on
the Kashmir issue, Zhou said that China hopes India and Pakistan
can settle their disputes through peaceful means and negotiations
and also in the spirit of the Simla Agreement and the Lahore
Declaration.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador also briefed the audience on the
development of New China over the past 50 years, especially in the
past two decades of reform and opening-up, as well as China's view
on the current global situation and China's foreign policy.

<HEADLINE> S. African Foreign Minister to Visit DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma will visit the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) at the weekend for talks with her
counterpart in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
"I'm going (to the DRC) with the aim to discuss common issues
and our relations between the two countries," she told reporters
at a breakfast briefing in Cape Town on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
DRC President Laurent Kabila has publicly accused the South
African government of hypocritically calling for a negotiated
solution to the conflict in his country, while backing the rebels
in the ongoing war.
</P>
<P>
This has been repeatedly denied by the South African
government.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini-Zuma earlier this week made it clear in Parliament that
South Africa would not be drawn into any regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should entertain the illusion that we might be
compelled to join one or other belligerent in any of these
conflicts," she said.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini-Zuma said there was no direct pressure on South Africa
to take sides and join the war, but acknowledged there were
indirect attempts.
</P>
<P>
"There has been some kind of expression that wants to brand us
as not neutral and not very friendly to the DRC government, which
obviously is based on the fact that we didn't take any sides," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini-Zuma repeated that South Africa would talk to all
sides, with the aim of bringing them to the negotiating table.

<HEADLINE> Donor Community to Continue to Provide Fund for Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Western donors, who provide about
one third of Uganda's government expenses, will continue to
provide large sums of fund to this African country in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
World Bank Country Director James Adams told a press conference
at Rwenzori House here Thursday that he highly praises Uganda's
performance in the past few years in almost all the sectors
funded by the multilateral financial institution.
</P>
<P>
"Uganda is now a model for developing countries whose
priorities are to eradicate poverty and develop infrastructure.
Uganda has achieved dramatic achievements in these areas. Its
poverty rate has dropped from 58 percent in the early 1990s to the
present 42 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, one of the key donors to Uganda, would continue
to cough large sums of fund into the country's annual budget and
development projects, the World Bank official said.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the Consultative Group meeting of the donor
community would be held on March 20-23, which would review the
achievements Uganda has so far made in cooperation with the donors
and work out plans for fund inflow into Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would also express the donors' prime concerns in
regard to the increase in defense budget and capacity building,
he added.
</P>
<P>
At the Consultative Group meeting last year, the donors pledged
to provide a total sum of 2.2 billion U.S. dollars to Uganda in
the next three years.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Wishes Resumption of Talks on W. Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan said here on Thursday that he wishes the talks on the
future of West Sahara will be resumed by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy for West Sahara, former U.S. Secretary of State
James Baker, is expected to organize in two months a meeting with
all the sides on the question of a self-determination referendum
in West Sahara, Annan told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"I have asked my personal envoy for the Sahara, Mr. Baker, to
meet all the sides concerned and look for with them a solution for
going out this impasse," said Annan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has recently called on Morocco and
the Polisario Front, a political organization for independence in
West Sahara, to solve their dispute and allow the holding of a
referendum.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also voted at the end of February to
prolong until May 31 the mandate of the U.N. mission in Sahara
charged with organizing the referendum, which has been delayed
since 1992 because of the dispute between Morocco and the
Polisario Front over the number of voters.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has recognized 86,381 people as eligible voters but
Morocco said 140,000 more people should be allowed to vote.
</P>
<P>
Annan said at the press conference that the U.N. could make a
kind of concession to Morocco as there are already 130,000
Moroccans who have asked for the right to vote.

<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Assaults on Remaining Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal forces continued
their assaults Thursday against the remaining rebels in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya and destroyed a small plane
reportedly intended to evacuate rebel commanders.
</P>
<P>
In Komsomolskoye village, scene of fierce fighting over the
past weeks, federal forces are still combing the area to look for
rebel commander Ruslan Gelayev, Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
He said "snipers occupied up to five houses in Komsomolskoye on
Thursday morning," vowing to "completely wipe out the bandits
there," the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Up to 20 rebels remain in a treeless area of the forest with a
diameter of about one kilometer" east of Komsomolskoye, Sergeyev
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, federal servicemen are fighting against some 300
rebels on a height of more than 1,000 meters near the Sharo-Argun
village, he added.
</P>
<P>
Su-24 bombers and Su-25 assault jets made about 20 raids on
rebel positions in the Sharo-Argun zone Thursday morning,
according to the military.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the rebels have been eliminated in the Russian
military campaign that started last September following waves of
armed Chechen incursions into neighboring Daghestan and a series
of apartment bombings, also blamed on Chechen militants, which
left some 300 people dead in Moscow and two other cities.
</P>
<P>
Russian estimates of the number of remaining rebels were
revised frequently. The latest estimate was put at 5,000, the
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Russian Deputy Interior Minister Basayev Igor Zubov
told reporters that Shamil Basayev and Khattab, two of the most
important rebel ringleaders, remain in the southern mountains of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"We know that they are in the southern part of the Argun gorge
where there are many caves. It is a nearly inaccessible and well-
fortified part of the terrain," Zubov said.
</P>
<P>
As the rebels mainly operate at night, military officials are
calling for more night vision equipment for the federal troops.
</P>
<P>
The past few weeks witnessed some of the heaviest losses of
federal servicemen, some of them elite paratroopers and special
police officers.
</P>
<P>
"We have suffered and will continue to suffer losses," Zubov
warned. "This is the price of stability."
</P>
<P>
In the Shali district, Russian forces destroyed a Yak-18 plane
belonging to Chechen rebels which was believed to be used in the
evacuation of a rebel commander from Russia., Interfax reported,
citing sources of the federal military headquarters.
</P>
<P>
This was the second rebel plane destroyed by the federal troops.
A small sports plane was blown out earlier.
</P>
<P>
As Russia moves closer to the presidential elections scheduled
for March 26, rumors are rising in the breakaway republic that the
rebels could capture Grozny and Gudermes, the two largest Chechen
cities.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence reports suggest that "gang leaders are continuing
their efforts to thwart the Russian presidential elections in
Chechnya," said Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin spokesman on
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Police forces there have been placed on high alert as of
Thursday to cope with the increased threat, Yastrzhembsky said.

<HEADLINE> Safety of Olympic Swimming Venue Shall be Ractified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic Coordination
Authority will supervise urgent remedial work on the Sydney 2000
aquatic center grandstand extensions to ensure safety for workers
and the public.
</P>
<P>
The OCA ordered an urgent engineers report after workers on the
site started industrial action last week for safety concerns of
the building.
</P>
<P>
OCA said access to the extension seating area would be
prohibited until the remedial safety requirements were met.
</P>
<P>
Labor unions claimed that engineering reports confirmed their
concerns about the safety of the venue. The workers walked off
the site March 6, saying steel structural supports were straining
under the weight of prefabricated concrete slabs, forcing bolts to
pop out of place. Live electrical wires were also dangerously
exposed.
</P>
<P>
Union officials met with the OCA Thursday to discuss the
stalemate but both parties left the meeting with conflicting
reports.
</P>
<P>
A Union representative said workers would not return to the
site until the site was cleared as safe.

<HEADLINE> Entry-Exit Loosened in Chongqing </HEADLINE>

<P>
CHONGQING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, the largest
metropolis in western China, will loosen its exit and entry
procedures and simplify customs formalities, a municipal public
security bureau official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
This move is aimed at providing more convenience for overseas
investors in western China, as the central government intensifies
the strategy of revitalizing the western regions of the country,
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the new regulations, foreign nationals, and Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan compatriots and their families will be
given residence documents with a period of validity ranging from
one to five years. Earlier, such documents were valid for only one
year.
</P>
<P>
Those who are invited to Chongqing for urgent business
activities and meetings will be allowed to enter, and then go
through the required procedures later, if they have no time to go
through such procedures beforehand.
</P>
<P>
The customs administration has also canceled a number of
unnecessary customs formalities.

<HEADLINE> Central China Eager to Woo Foreign Business Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
is trying to take advantage of its favorable geographic location
to play an active role in the country's new drive to boost
economic development in western China.
</P>
<P>
The province is preparing to invite up to 1,000 business people
from overseas to attend an international trade conference April 16
to 18 in its capital city of Zhengzhou.
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than 800 foreign entrepreneurs have responded
favorably.
</P>
<P>
"We are very much impressed with the significant role played
by multinational corporations in the world's economic
restructuring," said deputy governor Zhang Yixiang, adding that
Henan will offer as many preferential policies as possible to
attract more business giants to invest in Henan.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage them to cooperate with our state-owned
enterprises in every possible way," Zhang said. Henan is also
eager to benefit from information exchanges. "We want to be
inspired," said Zhang Yixiang, vice governor of Henan in charge of
foreign trade and investment, who admitted that business people in
Henan are narrow-minded compared with their competitors from China
's coastal areas and from abroad.
</P>
<P>
In order to narrow the mind-set gap, Henan is seeking
cooperation with Shanghai, China's commercial center in the east,
and Guangdong, the most economically advanced province in the
south. Zhang just returned from Shanghai where he took part in
economic and technological cooperation negotiations.
</P>
<P>
A delegation led by Shanghai's top leaders will visit Henan
next month and present a Shanghai fair in the province.
</P>
<P>
Henan Province serves as a traffic hub in China, as trains from
every direction run through the province. The capital city
Zhengzhou is the largest distribution center along the Asian-
European railway linking China's Lianyugang City on the east coast
with Holland.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that Henan Province plays the role of a "bridgehead"
for Chinese and foreign investors going west. Besides, it is the
only exit on the land for the north western provinces and regions.
For example, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China's largest
cotton producer, has a cotton distribution center in Zhengzhou
with a capacity of 100,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
"Henan has one of the best investment climates in China," said
Zhang, "and it is one of the most profit-making places, too."

<HEADLINE> Power Supply Method Reformed in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Power Company today
signed the first batch of power-sales contracts with five leading
power users in the city, including the local ventures of GE,
Siemens and Hitachi, symbolizing a significant shift to a market-
oriented management in power supply.
</P>
<P>
The contracts stipulate the form of power supply, the capacity
and quality of the power, the measurement of electricity, the
obligations and rights of both the suppliers and customers, the
settlement of bills, and other details.
</P>
<P>
For many years, the city's power production and consumption was
managed under the system of a planned economy. The current move
marks a substantial change in the way power is bought and sold in
Shanghai, said an official with the municipal industrial and
commercial bureau.
</P>
<P>
This change has been widely welcomed by local industrial
enterprises, and many local and foreign-funded firms expect to
sign contracts with power suppliers as soon as possible.

Participants all expressed their support to "the One China
Principle and the Taiwan Issue" white paper, saying it fully shows
the strong desire of the Chinese people and overseas Chinese
community for a reunited motherland.
</P>
<P>
Winston Chou, president of the Hong Kong Region China Peaceful
Reunification Association, said Premier Zhou Rongji's speech and
the white paper serve a timely and powerful guideline, which
rendered a heavy blow to the attempt for Taiwan independence by
making use of the so-called "presidential election."
</P>
<P>
It is an undeniable fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of
China, Chou said, noting that the future of Taiwan only lies in
reunifying with the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He said the practice of the "one country, two systems"
principle in Hong Kong and Macao demonstrates the tremendous
success of the principle and that it is applicable to Taiwan as
well.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the "one country, two system" principle would be more
lenient in solving the Taiwan issue, he said, noting that it is a
wise choice for the Taiwan authorities to return to the "one China
" principle and to the negotiations on the peaceful reunification.

<HEADLINE> ADB Provides 200 Mln Dollar Reform Loan to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
approved Thursday a 200-million-U.S.-dollar loan to Indonesia for
the country to deregulate and liberalize its industry.
</P>
<P>
The ADB said in a press release that the loan will finance a
program aimed at restructuring industry and opening up
opportunities for small and medium enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Industrial Competitiveness and Small and Medium Enterprise
Development Program will also promote the country's market
efficiency, restore investor confidence and position the economy
for recovery, said the ADB.
</P>
<P>
The bank pointed out that rationalizing the trade and
industrial regime will make markets operate more efficiently and
transparently and that, when resources are committed to commercial
activities, they will be employed productively.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the ADB said, assistance to the small and
medium enterprises will help create a dynamic sector that will
generate employment and benefit consumers as well as broaden the
distribution of market power.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, the ADB said it has approved a 25-million-
dollar equity investment in the Thailand Small and Medium-size
Enterprises Investment and Restructuring Fund (SIRF) which will be
set up shortly.
</P>
<P>
The SIRF -- which has a target size of 100 million dollars --
will invest in Thailand's small and medium enterprises with
promising businesses which are in need of expansion capital, said
the ADB.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Six policemen were killed and
several others wounded Thursday in a claymore ambush by the
separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in the east,
the state radio said.
</P>
<P>
The blast occurred when claymore mines hit the bus carrying
police convoy at Mylambaveli in the eastern district of Batticaloa,
some 300 kilometers east of the capital, the radio said in its
evening news broadcast.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has schemed several ambushes on military convoys in
the past few months, leaving heavy casualties on the part of the
government troops. In a recent ambush in the same district on
February 15, at least 13 policemen were killed and 14 others
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been waging a 17-year war to carve out an
independent homeland in the north and east for the minority Tamils
since 1983.More than 55,000 have been killed so far.

<HEADLINE> Manila Eyes More Women in Labor Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A female-dominated Philippine
workforce is no longer a remote possibility as more women are
joining the ranks of the country's labor force, Philippine Labor
Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma told reporters that in the last five years,
economically active women grew by 3.7 percent annually while the
male counterpart grew only by 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Of the total workforce in 1999, Laguesma said, 37.8 percent or
12.140 million were women. In 1998, the number of women in the
labor force reached 10.4 million.
</P>
<P>
In the deployment of female overseas workers, Laguesma said
newly hired female Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs) in 1999
reached 151,840 or 64 percent of the total while newly hired male
OFWs at 85,420 or 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most of these female OFWs were employed in the service sectors
at 76,782, followed by female professionals and technical workers
at 50,677, female production workers at 20,793.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma, however, stressed the need to train and upgrade women
workers' skills to help them learn better paid jobs.
</P>
<P>
Citing a report from the Bureau of Labor and Employment
Statistics (BLES), Laguesma said it is currently hard for women
without training or education to find employment.
</P>
<P>
He said BLES data showed that employed women with elementary or
low level of education decreased from 44 percent of the total
employed women in 1989 to 36.6 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Laguesma added that employed women with high school and college
education on the other hand, rose from 26.6 percent and 25 percent
in 1989 to 31.7 percent and 28.5 percent in 1999, respectively.

SINGAPORE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will host the third
Financial Stability Forum meeting scheduled for March 25-26, 2000,
the Television Corporation of Singapore reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The forum, set up by the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized
nations to promote soundness in the world's markets and banking
system, will discuss reports on ways of fostering further
implementation of international standards to strengthen the
financial system, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It will also discuss the case for establishing international
guidance on deposit insurance schemes and development in the
insurance industry, it added.
</P>
<P>
The report also said forum's working groups are due to present
findings and recommendations on three topics -- highly leveraged
institutions, capital flows and offshore financial centers.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Stability Forum was formed in February 1999 after
the near-failure of a U.S. hedge fund caused a crisis in Asia and
Russia as well as market turbulence.

<HEADLINE> Toxic Waste Van to Be removed from Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Metro Manila Development
Authority (MMDA) and Greenpeace, the international environmental
watchdog, agreed Thursday to remove the toxic waste inside a
container van away from Metro Manila for temporary storage in
Pampanga province.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after a meeting between MMDA Chairman
Jejomar Binay and Greenpeace leader Von Hernandez, ending a
possible conflict between the two parties due to the toxic garbage
from the former U.S. Clark Airbase in Pampanga in the northern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace dumped the wastes in front of the U.S. Embassy in
Metro Manila as a "going-away-gift" for U.S. servicemen who took
part in the just-ended war games dubbed "Balikatan (shoulder to
shoulder) 2000."
</P>
<P>
Hernandez told reporters that the act was meant to compel the
Americans to take back the wastes they left in Clark after the
expiration of the Military Bases Agreement in 1991.
</P>
<P>
As expected, U.S. Embassy officials ignored Greenpeace's move
and the van was removed by the police and the MMDA to clear the
road of a traffic block.
</P>
<P>
The offending van of toxic wastes is now at the MMDA impounding
area in North Harbor of Metro Manila, according to Binay.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez thanked Binay for meeting them Thursday to discuss
the matter and clear the issue of possible misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez said Greenpeace will cooperate with MMDA in moving
the van to Pampanga for temporary storage.

<HEADLINE> Mainland Not to Have Contact With Taiwan Independence Supporter (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- People on the Chinese mainland
should not have contact with a person who shouts "Long live the
independence of Taiwan," Professor Huang Jiashu of the People's
University of China said here today.
</P>
<P>
If such a person becomes the leader of Taiwan, there will be
growing crisis and tension in cross-Straits relations, which will
harm the good fortune and interests of the people of Taiwan, Huang
said at a press conference here today hosted by the Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).
</P>
<P>
At present, some in Taiwan say that when a candidate favoring
the "independence of Taiwan" comes into power, the Chinese
mainland will accept him and have contact with him as well. This
is the election tactic of Chen Shui-bian and the Democratic
Progressive Party, and Taiwan compatriots should beware of it,
Huang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland always resolutely opposes the "
independence of Taiwan." Relations between the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits will become more tense if a candidate favoring the
"independence of Taiwan" seize power, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Xin Qi, a research fellow at the China Peace and Development
Studies Center, said that the assumption of the reins of
government by a man who clings to the "independence of Taiwan" is
a challenge to the national interests of China and to regional and
world peace. The Chinese government will by no means sit by and
watch.

Li Jiaquan, executive director of the Taiwan Studies Society,
said that persistence in the one China principle is fundamental
for the Chinese mainland. "We should not tolerate the '
independence of Taiwan' in any form," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen Shui-bian uttered the words "Long live the independence of
Taiwan" as early as 1989, and has never changed his attitude over
the past decade and more, he said.
</P>
<P>
Guo Zhenyuan, a researcher at the China Institute of
International Studies, said China must realize the cause of
reunification, which is the aspiration of the Chinese people at
home and abroad. The local election in Taiwan touches upon an
issue of principle, namely, how to develop cross-Straits relations
and whether China should be united or split. Therefore, the
Chinese government must make it clear that whoever comes into
power must not engage in any form of "Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
Xu Shiquan, director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies under
the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, expressed the hope that
Taiwan compatriots will refrain from impulse and take their own
interests as well as the interests of the Chinese nation into
consideration at this historic juncture in cross-Straits relations.
If a situation which no one wants to see does occur, the people of
Taiwan will be the major sufferers.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Foreign Investment to Tap Mineral Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China plans to attract more funds
from overseas to explore and develop domestic mineral resources,
said Tian Fengshan, newly appointed Minister of Land Resources,
here today.
</P>
<P>
China will further open its mineral exploration market and
allow foreign companies to explore minerals either as sole
investors or in joint ventures, said Tian during the ministry's
national teleconference.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies which invest in developing and recycling
minerals, especially those minerals difficult to mine with China's
current technology, will enjoy preferential treatment, said Tian.
</P>
<P>
China encourages foreign businesses to collaborate with
domestic mine enterprises, and foreign companies may participate
in mineral exploration by holding shares of technologies and
equipment, or they may purchase mineral exploration rights from
China's state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the ministry issued a circular to relax restrictions
on mineral exploration by foreign companies, and China is
currently attracting foreign investment for mineral exploration in
the southwestern province of Yunnan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China will fully participate in
exploring mineral resources in other countries in order to ensure
a sustainable, rapid and healthy develop of its national economy.
</P>
<P>
Tian Fengshan, Minister of Land Resources, said during a
national teleconference here today that China should utilize both
domestic and foreign mineral resources to meet the demands of the
nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
China is facing mineral shortages, especially petroleum, iron,
copper and sylvite. Therefore, exploiting minerals in foreign
countries is an inevitable choice for China, Tian noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that utilization of foreign minerals may take many
forms. For example, China may directly purchase minerals which are
in urgent demand and at low prices on the international market.
</P>
<P>
As for iron, sylvite and other minerals which are in short
supply in China but have high proven deposit in other countries,
China may purchase shares in foreign mines or collaborate with the
mines.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Chinese enterprises are encouraged to explore
for minerals including petroleum, natural gas, copper, and
diamonds in other countries, and build mines there.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum, natural gas, rich iron and manganese mines, copper,
alum clay, chromite and platinum are all the key minerals of
interest to China, and the country will focus on cooperation with
neighboring countries, Latin America and Africa, where mineral
resources are abundant and the investment environment good, said
Tian.
</P>
<P>
In addition, investment in the United States, Canada and
Australia will also be considered, Tian added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will strengthen exploitation of petroleum and
natural gas resources in Central Asia, Russia, the Middle East and
Africa, according to Tian.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that China will offer policy and financial
support to the tapping of foreign minerals, and will collect
information on foreign mineral conditions and investment
environment. The country will also institute related policies on
taxes and foreign trade and loans, and establish support funds for
overseas mineral ventures.

resources in ten key areas in western regions.
</P>
<P>
Exploration for minerals which are urgently needed and have
significant bearing on the national economy will be accelerated in
regions including Tarim, Qaidam, and Altay, the upper reaches of
the Jinsha River, and the middle and lower reaches of the Lancang
(Mekong) River, said Tian Fengshan, Minister of Land Resources,
here today.
</P>
<P>
Tian said during today's national teleconference that in
addition to mineral resources, China will strengthen
investigations into land and water resources in the west as a base
for the development of western China, and to relieve water
shortages there.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the harmonious development between resources
utilization and environmental protection, and said the ministry
will monitor farmland on slopes, and provide information on
turning farmland into forests and grassland.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat Vows to Hold Firm to Jerusalem as Palestinian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat reiterated Thursday his vow to hold firm to
making Jerusalem as the capital of an independent Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
After attending a prayer on the occasion of Eid al-Adha, the
Muslim Feast of Sacrifice, Arafat sent a message to Arab nations,
stressing that he did not forget that Jerusalem is the capital of
the independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"My message is strong and clear-cut," Arafat told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the whole of Jerusalem in wars with its Arab
neighbors in 1948 and 1976, and annexed it in its political map in
the 1980s as its "indivisible and eternal" capital, a move rejected
by the international community in general and the Arab and Islamic
states in particular.
</P>

The status of Jerusalem is one of the toughest issues to be
discussed in the final-status talks between the Palestinians and
Israel, which also deal with border demarcation, the future of
Jewish settlements, the return of Palestinian refugees and the
distribution of water resources.
</P>
<P>
After being suspended for more than one month due to difference
between the two sides over some interim and final-status issues,
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are scheduled to resume in
Washington on March 20.

<P>
The Palestinian side has insisted on regaining Jerusalem, or at
least its Arab eastern part, while Israeli has claimed that the
holy city will not be divided.
</P>
<P>
According to high-level Israeli sources, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak does not intend to hold negotiations with the
Palestinians over the Jerusalem issue within the framework of
final-status talks.

<P>
COLOMBO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga and the main opposition United National Party (UNP)
leader Ranil Wickremesinghe Thursday resumed their talks on the
proposed constitutional reform.
</P>
<P>
It was the second round of talks between them since they met
for the first time on March 9 after Kumaratunga beat the
opposition leader at the presidential elections last December.
</P>
<P>
The talks were "focused on chapters of the draft constitution
of October 1997, relating to citizenship and the devolution of
power," the state radio said in its night broadcast.
</P>
<P>
The mode of appointment of provincial governors and of the
region was discussed in details, said the radio.

A committee was appointed to examine further the question of
the mode of appointment of the governors and also the current
proposals relating to the fundamental rights and the judiciary and

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Denies Selling Weapons to Angolan Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
has not sold anything to Angolan rebels in defiance of
international sanctions, South African Foreign Minister Nkosazana
Dlamini-Zuma said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
She was reacting to a report which was released in New York on
Wednesday by the United Nations sanctions committee on Angola led
by Canadian Ambassador to the U.N. Robert Fowler.
</P>
<P>
The report identified two sitting African presidents and a
dozen countries as violators of sanctions against the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) by helping
UNITA rebels smuggle diamonds to buy arms and oil for their
25-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
The report called South Africa's enforcement of sanctions "lax
or selective" and quoted UNITA officials as saying that they had
been received by senior officials in South Africa last August and
had bought a 35mm anti- aircraft artillery in defiance of
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government has never tried to sell UNITA
anything," Dlamini-Zuma told reporters in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
She said the government was prepared to prosecute those South
Africans who were named in the report as sanction busters if there
was enough evidence.
</P>
<P>
The value of the Fowler Report was that it would serve as a
deterrent for any future violations, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
"These people now know they are known and they will be watched.
 Obviously, if there's evidence they will be prosecuted, but even
if there isn't, they are unlikely to want to continue," she said.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini-Zuma said part of the problem with the Fowler Report
was that the committee's informants appeared to be a few people
who had crossed over from UNITA to the Angolan government's side.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed an arms and oil embargo on
UNITA in 1993 in an effort to end Angola's civil war. In mid-1998,
the council added a travel and financial ban on UNITA leaders and
an embargo on the rebel diamond trade, estimated to have brought
the group some four billion U.S. dollars since1992.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Secretary Holds Talks With Japanese Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen Thursday held a series of talks with Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi and other Japanese leaders on bilateral and
regional issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
In separate meetings with Obuchi, Japanese Foreign Minister
Yohei Kono and Defense Agency Chief Tsutomu Kawara, the two sides
agreed to return air traffic control in Okinawa Prefecture by the
U.S. military and to resolve an air pollution problem at a U.S.
military base in Kanagawa Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
But they did not make progress in narrowing differences over
Japan's host-nation financial support for U.S. forces stationed in
the country, Japanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
At an earlier meeting with Kono over lunch, Cohen, who arrived
here Wednesday, said the U.S. would return control of Okinawa air
traffic at the U.S. Kadena Air Base.
</P>
<P>
The flight control system at the Kadena base, which controls
all civilian and U.S. military flights within an 80-kilometer
radius of the central Okinawa base, was designated to be operated
by the U.S. military for a provisional period under the Japan-U.S.
agreement signed on the return of Okinawa to Japan in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been calling on the United States to return flight
control to Japan since the trouble with the system last November
caused some disruption to commercial flights to and from Naha
airport.
</P>
<P>
On an air pollution problem at the U.S. Naval Air Facility in
Atsugi near Tokyo, Kawara outlined the measures Japan will take to
tackle the issue.
</P>
<P>
The United States has complained that an industrial-waste
disposal facility releasing dioxins in the vicinity of the Atsugi
base is threatening the health of U.S. Navy personnel and their
families.
</P>
<P>
On host-nation support, Cohen called for keeping Japan's
financial support for U.S. forces stationed in the country intact,
while Kono and Kawara again called for consideration to be given
to Japan's tight fiscal conditions, the Japanese officials said.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the United States began negotiations in January to
renew a five-year bilateral host-nation treaty, which expires in
March next year, but remain at odds over Japan's plan to cut its
support.

<HEADLINE> China's State Council Sets Up Office for West Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council has opened
its office in charge of developing the country's west, and
appointed Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of the State Development
Planning Commission, to head the new establishment.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua today, the minister said his office
will focus on four tasks this year; the first is drafting a master
plan for orderly growth.
</P>
<P>
He said regional governments in the west and related State
Council departments have already begun the work, and based on
their recommendations his office will create the master plan and
submit it to the central authorities for approval by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The second job at hand is to work out a set of policies to
create a good atmosphere for western development. Zeng stressed
that attention should not only be given to fiscal, taxation,
investment and price policies, but also to policies that would
further promote the reforms, expand China's opening and push ahead
with the overall progress of society.
</P>
<P>
"Priority must be given to the research of policies concerning
science and technology development and the attraction of talent,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The third task is to accelerate the construction of
infrastructure in the west. Zeng said a larger proportion of the
proceeds from the newly-issued treasury bonds this year will be
spent on projects in the west.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the state will arrange 10 major projects in
the west and speed up preparations for five major infrastructure
projects there.
</P>
<P>
A total of 31 billion yuan will be spent to quicken the
construction of 78 large and medium-sized projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zeng, the fourth job this year is to work hard to
protect the environment during the construction.
</P>
<P>
He noted that while projects for the protection of natural
forests will continue, the changing of farmland into forests and
grassland will be tried this year to pool experience for further
promotion.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the importance of overall planning,
maintaining a scientific approach to the work and focusing efforts
on priority areas in developing the west.

BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Wei Jianxing, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of China (CPC), said here today that different social systems in
China and Mongolia and differences in ideological views between
the CPC and the Mongolian Social-Democratic Party would not hamper
the growth of bilateral relations.

state-to-state relations," he said. As ruling parties, the CPC and
MSDP can share experience on how to run a country and exchange
views on other issues of peace and development.
</P>
<P>

On China-Mongolia relations, Wei praised the speedy growth of
bilateral ties in recent years, attributing the bilateral
cooperation in all fields to the frequent high-level exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Top leaders between the two countries have already confirmed

bilateral ties in the new century.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China and Mongolia respect each other's
independence and state sovereignty and the development course
chosen by their people.
</P>
<P>
As long as China and Mongolia adhere to the basic principles
set forth in the China-Mongolia Friendship and Cooperation Treaty
and take a firm hold of the overall direction of bilateral
relations, the two neighboring countries can enjoy long-term
friendship and maintain a peaceful surrounding environment so that
both can concentrate on economic development and improvement of
people's life, he said.

seen continuous growth in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Major Mongolian political parties all stand for developing ties
with China, he told Wei.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have close relations that go beyond peaceful
coexistence, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the current visit, he said he was impressed with China's
development and hoped the two countries could enhance cooperation
in all fields so as to bring bilateral ties to a new phase.

<HEADLINE> High-Tech Zones Gain Fastest Growth in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The 53 state high-tech
development zones in China have become the fastest growing part of
the Chinese economy, dwarfing the country's economic growth rate
of seven percent in 1999 by more than 20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Science and Technology Zhu Lilan told reporters
today the total technological, industrial and trade revenue and
industrial output generated by the 53 high-tech zones jumped by 35
and 30 percent last year to 656 billion yuan (80 billion U.S.
dollars) and 566 billion yuan (69 billion U.S. dollars),
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that the zones, which have been set up during
the past decade to speed up commercialization of the country's
high-tech achievements, have met the key economic development
targets set by the central government for year 2000 a year ahead
of schedule, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the 17,900 enterprises in the zones across the
country made a total profit of 35.6 billion yuan (43 billion U.S.
dollars) and paid 27.5 billion yuan (3.3 billion U.S. dollars) in
taxes, with combined export earnings reaching 10.6 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"With better facilities and favorable policies offered by
central and local governments, these zones have become China's
important centers for such high-tech industries as electronics,
information technology, new material, biological engineering, new
energy and environmental protection," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"Rapid development in the high-tech industry will continue to
help optimize the country's economic restructuring and promote
sustained, rapid and healthy economic development," she added.
</P>
<P>
In the Zhongguancun Science and Technological Development Zone
in northwest Beijing, home to China's most prestigious
universities and leading research organizations, high-tech
industries accounted for 70 percent of the total newly-added value
of the city's industrial output in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In Shenzhen, south China, high-tech products accounted for 40
percent of the boomtown's total industrial output, or 82 billion
yuan (nearly 10 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999, up 25 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted a number of measures to encourage the
development of high-tech zones during the past few years,
including favorable treatment for investors, policies for use of
venture capital, and income distribution reforms.

<HEADLINE> Reunification Timetable in Hands of Taiwan People: Experts (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Noted Beijing-based scholars and
experts on the Taiwan issue said here today that the reunification
of the motherland should have a timetable, and it's up to the
Taiwan people to set it.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here today by the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits, scholars and experts of
Taiwan affairs fielded questions regarding the current situation
in Taiwan and cross-Straits relations.
</P>
<P>
Li Jiaquan, executive director of the Taiwan Studies Society,
said that there should be a timetable for the settlement of the
Taiwan issue and the motherland's reunification, and the Taiwan
issue should not be dragged on indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan side is responsible for the current tension in cross-
Straits relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The independent forces in Taiwan have developed to a point that
they are likely to come to power, therefore the issue can't go on
forever, he noted.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan side sincerely desires peace, the two sides can
sit down for reunification talks, the scholar said.

<TEXT>
<P>
However, if the Taiwan authorities decide to seek independence,
continue to stall on the matter and refuse reunification with the
motherland, then the initiative of setting a timetable will no
longer rest with Taiwan, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Huang Jiashu from the Chinese People's University said
that the mainland has said time and again that any subject can be
discussed under the one-China principle, including the time and
means of reunification.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan authorities have the will to negotiate peaceful
reunification with the mainland, then the time of reunification
can be discussed, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
However, if the Taiwan authorities refuse negotiations,
constantly advocate separatism, and engage in Taiwan independence
activities, then there will be no room for discussion on the
timing of reunification, the professor stressed.
</P>
<P>
Researcher Xin Qi from the Peace and Development Studies Center
here agreed that if the Taiwan side refuses to negotiate and moves
further down the road of separation, then it will be time for non-
peaceful settlement of the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Xu Bodong from the Beijing United University stressed
that the timetable of reunification lies with both the mainland,
the leaders of Taiwan and particularly the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The professor expressed the sincere hope that the people of
Taiwan will make the right choice.

<P>
ANKARA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Saadettin Tantan, the Turkish Interior Minister who paid an
official visit to Britain, said Wednesday that the two countries
had agreed to sign a Security and Cooperation Agreement.
</P>
<P>
"After signing this agreement, all criminals that are wanted by
Turkey through Interpol will be returned to Turkey," Tantan said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the development about the return of Nurettin Guven
and Gulay Asliturk, the two infamous Turkish criminals who live in
Britain, Tantan noted that Britain would extradite all criminals
after the agreement is signed.
</P>
<P>
Sabah (Morning):
</P>
<P>
-- Bursa province, the heartland of thread, automotive and
machine manufacturing industry in Turkey's northwest, was mostly
affected by the Asia crisis as thousands of people became
unemployed and hundreds of business places were closed.
</P>
<P>
Bursa shrunk with its economy. But Bursa Chamber of Commerce and
Industry Chairman Celal Sonmez said, "we are hopeful from the year
2000. Actually, there is a recovery in automotive and textiles
sectors."
</P>
<P>
Radikal (Radical):
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arafat Orders Release of 105 Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat on Thursday granted amnesty to 105
Palestinians jailed for criminal offences to mark Eid al-Adha, the
Muslim Feast of Sacrifice, Voice of Palestine radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Israeli government announced Wednesday night to
release 45 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, of whom 15
were jailed for "security reasons" and 30 on criminal charges, in a
goodwill gesture to the Palestinians on the eve of Eid al-Adha.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli joint committee on prisoners affairs
held Wednesday night a meeting in west Jerusalem to discuss the
release of a new batch of Palestinian prisoners according to a
memorandum signed last September.
</P>
<P>
Israel, since the signing of the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum in
Egypt, has released 383 Palestinian prisoners in several batches.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,500 Palestinians still held in Israeli jails
for "security reasons."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side demanded the release of 100 prisoners taken
in custody before 1994 when the self-rule was installed in
Palestinian territories. But the Israeli side said it was only up
to Israel to decide who would be released and on what basis they
would be released.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Asked to Buy More Thai Agricultural Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Thai commerce ministry has
asked the United States to import more Thai agricultural products,
particularly raw sugar, canned pineapple and crabs, Thai Deputy
Commerce Minister Paithoon Kaewthong said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Paithoon was quoted by Thailand News Agency as saying that he
made the request when meeting with visiting U.S. deputy permanent
secretary for agriculture, as the U.S. side has asked Thailand to
support the liberalization of farm trade at the upcoming new round
of world trade talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks are expected to be opened soon.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the U.S. to lower import tariffs for Thai canned
pineapple, saying that a review recently issued by the U.S.
government found that the Thai products were not included in
alleged dumping cases lodged by American firms.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between Thailand and the U.S. amounted to 19.04
billion U.S. dollars last year, with Thailand gaining a trade
surplus of 6.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
But exports of Thai agricultural products to the U.S. accounted
for only one billion dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> Legal Framework Key to Thailand's E-Commerce Growth: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The lack of a legal framework in
Thailand on electronic commerce (e-commerce) is the major obstacle
for the country's development of the newest way of doing business,
Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi told Xinhua here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has been aware of the problem and has
taken actions to catch up by drafting bills on e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Tuesday, the cabinet approved draft e-commerce and
digital signature bills in a bid to lay down guideline for on-line
trading and bring the country's e-commerce up to global standard.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the E-commerce Bill was to legitimize the
status of on-line trading activities as well as encourage on-line
transactions between local traders and either local or foreign
parties.
</P>
<P>
The Digital Signature Bill is a key bill to ensure trader
confidence concerning on-line transaction security.
</P>
<P>
Besides the two bills, the government has four more e-commerce-
related bills for approval, which cover electronic fund transfers,
data protection, computer crime and universal access.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, who is also the country's commerce minister, hoped
that the six bills could be enacted within this year after
parliament consideration.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National E-Commerce Conference which was opened
here Thursday, Supachai said the government should also developed
a system that would be able to render the payment system
creditable, to bring in more banks to the sector and to develop
Thailand's own human resources so that the rules and regulations
can be supervised by capable government officials.
</P>
<P>
The government should also disseminate more information to
exporters and businessmen about their rights and opportunities and
assist them to construct their own websites.
</P>
<P>
Supachai also pledged that the government will reduce
intervention in the sector and reduce the cost of
telecommunication by liberalizing the telecom industry as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization process may start next year, he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We are under way," Supachai said, adding: "We have set up a
national regulatory body for the telecom sector and what is being
done should be completed next year."
</P>
<P>
The value of e-commerce transaction in Thailand in the next two
year was expected to reach 25 billion baht (661 million U.S.
dollars) annually, up from 22 billion baht (582 million dollars)
in 1998, according to a survey conducted by the Commerce Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Three S. African Sanctions Busters Deny Allegation by UN Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Three South African sanction
busters on Thursday denied allegations that they violated the
United Nations (UN) sanctions against the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Brothers Ronnie and Joe de Decker, named in the UN special
report accusing them of illegally earning over five million
dollars through arms- for-diamonds deal with the UNITA since 1993,
denied the claims to the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
The brothers said they have stopped the diamonds deal with the
UNITA since the UN imposed the strict embargo on UNITA in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Since then we have had no further activities in Angola," they
said.
</P>
<P>
Another South African businessman Denis Clochlan also denied
the UN claim, saying "all my operations are legitimate, only with
the Luanda government".
</P>
<P>
The UN on Wednesday issued a report identifying five South
Africans violating the UN arms, fuel, travel and diamond trade
sanctions against the Angolan rebel movement, urging the South
African government to adopt effective measures to cease the
illegal diamond trade between its citizens and UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of South African Foreign Affairs Department
Aziz Pahad on Wednesday pledged South Africa would take action
against sanctions busters if evidence against them was secured.
</P>
<P>
The UN in 1993 banned sales of arms, military equipment and
fuel to UNITA, which has been at war with the Angolan government
since independence in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were extended in 1997 to finance, travel and the
diamond trade.

MACAO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of Beijing
has sent several animals to the Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) in efforts to strengthen the friendly ties between
the two places.
</P>
<P>
The animals include a 12-year-old female black bear, a pair of
white swans, a pair of black swans, and three pairs of mandarin
ducks, which had been raised in the Beijing Zoo.
</P>
<P>
The precious gifts embody the profound friendship between the
people of the two places, Yan Zhongqiu, vice secretary-general of
the Beijing municipal government, said Thursday afternoon at a
ceremony for the handover of the animals.
</P>
<P>
He also said there existed great potentials in terms of
economic, cultural, educational and scientific exchanges between

HONG KONG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Swire Properties, a core
business unit of Hong Kong-listed conglomerate Swire Pacific, is
building Hong Kong's largest interconnected commercial campus in
Island East.
</P>
<P>
The Island East scheme comprises of eight Grade A office
buildings and three technology centers that will house 300 local

<HEADLINE> China's Financial Sector Maintains Smooth Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China's financial operation has
maintained a good development trend in the first two months of
this year, with both loans and deposits growing at higher speed,
according to the monthly report on financial statistics released
today by the People's Bank of China (PBOC).
</P>
<P>
The report said that China's financial institutions are in good
order, with improved payment capability and a stable exchange rate
for the local currency Renminbi, and only a slight slowdown in the
increase of money supply.
</P>
<P>
By the end of February, the outstanding amount of broad money (
M2) was 12.1583 trillion yuan, up 12.8 percent from the same
period last year but 1.9 percentage points lower than at the end
of last year. The outstanding amount of narrow money (M1) was 4.
4679 trillion yuan, up 15.3 percent, 2.4 percentage points lower
than at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The statistics show that major reason for the sluggishness in
the money supply is the drastic dropping of the amount of money in
circulation. At the end of February, the outstanding amount of
money in circulation (M0) was 1.3983 trillion yuan, up 9.4 percent
from the same period last year but down 24.8 percentage points
from the end of the previous month. Generally speaking, this is a
normal and seasonal readjustment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of February, the outstanding amount of loans by all
financial institutions was 9.4353 trillion yuan, up 12.7 percent
in constant terms; while the outstanding amount of all deposits
was 10.9963 trillion yuan, up 13.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> China to Direct International Assistance to Western Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will give
preferential consideration to the country's western areas in
implementing schemes of international assistance, according to
Long Yongtu, chief negotiator of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In carrying out the development strategy in the west, China
will first mobilize its own forces, but assistance from
international organizations and foreign governments will also play
an important role, Long said at a meeting to outline the work held
here today.
</P>
<P>
China will not work for economic progress in the west at the
expense of the environment, but will try to balance economic
development with a sound ecological system there, Long said.
</P>
<P>
This complies with the policies of international organizations
and foreign governments that provide assistance to China, he added,
noting that most of China's cooperative partners are well-
experienced and technologically advanced in the realm of
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
In the 20 years since China's opening up, international
assistance has contributed greatly to the country's economic and
social growth. According to estimates, bilateral and multi-lateral
unconditional assistance have accumulated to four billion U.S.
dollars in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
The present day achievements of the coastal areas, which
benefited most from international assistance in the 1980s, are a
direct result of the foreign aid, Long pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said international assistance is helpful not just in terms
of investment and construction projects, but more for its role in
educating people about advanced technology and management.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day meeting, officials and scholars gave brief
explanations of the history and agenda of the strategy to develop
western China to representatives from foreign countries and
international organizations.

<HEADLINE> Encryption Rules Do Not Include Cell Phones, Windows, Browser Software, Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The scope of China's "Commercial-
Use Encryption Management Regulations" does not include wireless
telephones, Windows software and browser software, a senior trade
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The "encryption products and equipment containing encryption
technology" specified in the regulations issued by the State
Council, are restricted only to software and hardware for which
encryption and decryption operations are core functions, said
Zhang Xiang, deputy minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with business representatives from a dozen
countries including the United States, France, Japan and the
Republic of Korea, Zhang said China will not demand "encryption
key trusteeship" of foreign encryption products and equipment
containing the technology.
</P>
<P>
Foreign businesses shall not worry about this point, he said.
</P>
<P>
China promulgated the "Commercial-Use Encryption Management
Regulations" on October 7 last year. The State Encryption
Management Committee (SEMC) followed it up with a public statement
on November 8 on the implementation of these regulations. The
release of these documents has aroused serious concern from
foreign businesses.
</P>
<P>
Zhang told the foreign business representatives that the
Chinese government has sincerely paid attention to these worries
and will make necessary clarifications in due time.
</P>
<P>
The government has already started to research laws and
regulations on encryption in line with WTO regulations and China's
commitment to foreign governments, and the "Commercial-Use
Encryption Management Regulations" are also included among those
to be studied and put in order, Zhang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated China's "firm and unshakable determination" to
expand its opening-up, saying that China will be responsible for
fulfilling its promises.
</P>
<P>
Also present at today's meeting, which was meant to hear
opinions from foreign companies, were officials from the SEMC, the
Ministry of Information Industry, and the Legislative Affairs
Office of the State Council.

<HEADLINE> Chronic Diseases Threatening Beijingers' Health Revealed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- One of every four residents of
the Chinese capital suffers from heart problems, cerebral vascular
disease or diabetes mainly brought on by unhealthy lifestyles, a
recent study shows.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2.96 million Beijing citizens were diagnosed with
chronic heart disease, cerebral vascular disease, diabetes, tumor,
tooth and gum problems, ophthalmologic ailments leading to
blindness, or mental disorder, revealed the study conducted by the
Beijing Municipal Bureau of Health.
</P>
<P>
Many of them are smokers, eat unhealthy food and lead a
sedentary lifestyle, or are overweight, all of which are risk
factors for high blood pressure, heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
"About 80 Beijing people die every day from cardio and cerebral
vascular diseases," said Jia Peiqi at the bureau's office for
health promotion.
</P>
<P>
The city now has two million hypertension patients, 100,000
stroke victims and 740,000 diabetics. The rate of lung, liver, and
stomach cancer has reached one in every 740 people.
</P>
<P>
High medical costs from chronic diseases have greatly exceeded
the local economic growth rate, overburdening the city's
development, said Jin Dapeng, deputy director of the health bureau.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed major weapons against the epidemic should
be health promotion activities to educate the public about high-
risk factors.

<HEADLINE> Mount Huangshan Administration Receives UN Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Administrators of Mount Huangshan,
a world-famous tourist resort in Anhui Province, east China, today
received the top awards for worldwide heritage preservation.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time China has clinched the honors,
established by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and named after Melina Mercouri,
late Greek culture minister who made outstanding contributions to
relics protection.
</P>
<P>
As a beautiful scenic spot, the mountain was named on the world
cultural and natural heritage list by UNESCO in 1990.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO had approved 631 world heritage sites by the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
"We have followed the international covenant on heritage
maintenance for the past decade," said Zang Shikai, head of the
mountain's administration committee. "We strive to keep the
original appearance of the mountains."
</P>
<P>
Zang, also a top official of Huangshan City which governs the
scenic spot, said that they are carrying out a sustainable
development plan in the area.
</P>
<P>
Many UNESCO officials who have visited the mountain praised it
as an international example of successful preservation.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the city has a total of 30 high-
quality guest houses and three advanced sightseeing telpher
systems.
</P>
<P>
Nearly five million tourists visited the mountain last year,
including 220,000 from overseas. The city's earnings from tourism
came to about 1.5 billion yuan (181 million U.S. dollars) that
year.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the state will spend five billion yuan on
infrastructure construction in the coming three years.
</P>
<P>
The local government also expects to build a high-level
transportation network connecting Huangshan and adjacent
prosperous areas in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Zang expressed their ambitious wish to initiate
joint tourism packages for rapidly promoting the industry, and
said they might open overseas representative offices for further
business.

<HEADLINE> Joint Efforts Urged to Prevent Taiwan Independence (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official in
charge of Taiwan affairs appealed today for joint efforts from
both sides of the Taiwan Straits to prevent the independence of
the island province.
</P>
<P>
Tang Shubei, executive vice president of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), said that Taiwan is at
a critical juncture and now is the time for Chinese compatriots on
both sides of the Straits to work together to stop the island from
becoming independent, and strive for peace across the Straits and
the deepening of cross-Straits relations, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Meeting the press here today, Tang said that the question now
is whether Taiwan will aim for "independence" rather than
reunification with the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that quite a number of Taiwan compatriots have
some misgivings about the reunification, and we also think that
the reunification will take time," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, just as President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji
have pointed out, if the prospects of peaceful reunification are
undermined and become impossible, the Chinese people are ready to
shed blood and give their lives to defend the nation's sovereignty
and territorial integrity, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to uphold the one-China principle and the policy
of 'peaceful reunification; one country, two systems', and will do
our utmost for the peaceful reunification of the motherland," Tang
said.
</P>
<P>
The stance is made crystal-clear in the White Paper on the
issue of Taiwan, he said.

<P>
Tang said that increased economic and trade ties between the
two sides of the Straits and the frequent visits across the
Straits have benefited both sides of the Straits over the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
And yet the situation beneficial to both sides of the Straits
is now being seriously undermined, he said.
</P>
<P>
If the person nominated in Taiwan's forthcoming election
insists on "Taiwan independence", and advocates that "Taiwan is
not part of China" and that the two sides of the Taiwan Straits
are "two Chinese nations," then "we'll have no other choice," Tang
said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the common understanding reached between ARATS and
the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) in 1992 that both sides
should uphold the one China principle, Tang said that only by
following this principle can the two sides possibly sit down for
talks, enhance mutual understanding and ultimately secure the
nation's reunification.
</P>
<P>
As is reiterated in the White Paper, the two sides can hold
talks on any subject under the principle of one-China, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"We stand for 'one country, two systems', we are also ready to
hear suggestions from representatives of all parties and all walks
of life from Taiwan, to have equal consultations and find
solutions that better take care of Taiwan compatriots' interests
and are acceptable to both sides," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
However, it is crucial that the Taiwan authorities return to
the previously-held one-China principle and the common
understanding reached between ARATS and the SEF, Tang said.

low, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Volume was 17.3 million Cyprus pounds (about 29.4 million U.S.
dollars) as investors, seeing no reversal of the current downtrend,
dumped more shares.
</P>
<P>
All sectors showed losses ranging from a massive 18 percent in
the insurance sector to a less dramatic 0.9 percent for investment
companies.
</P>
<P>
With a total 80-point loss since March 1, the market is
struggling to keep its head above water and is being dogged by
constant rumors of shady dealings that are sapping investors'
confidence.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, about 80 companies are queuing up for a listing on the
market, tying down millions of pounds in investors' money.
</P>
<P>
In response to the downtrend and in an attempt to revive
investors' interest, the Central Bank of Cyprus Thursday partly
lifted a recent ban on commercial banks on giving loans for the
purchase of shares.
</P>
<P>
A Central Bank announcement said fixed deposits accounts could
now be used as collateral for loans to buy shares, but only up to
the amount deposited.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Planes Continue Air Raids in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes launched fresh
attacks on northern part of the Israeli occupied security zone
Thursday morning, but there are no reports so far of the casualties
and damage in the raids.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army spokesman said Israeli warplanes have returned
safely. Lebanese security source said that Israel launched four air
attacks on south Lebanon on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israel began daily air raids in south Lebanon as of Monday, two
days after the end of an Arab foreign ministers' conference that
was held in Beirut. A resolution adopted at the conference harshly
denounced Israel's aggression and attack on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying a border zone in south Lebanon since
1985. Fire tradings between Israeli occupation troops and Lebanese
guerrillas have become a regular occurrence ever since.
</P>
<P>
South Lebanon has been dogged by escalating fire exchanges
between Israeli troops and Hezbollah guerrillas since the breakdown
of peace talks between Israel and Lebanon's powerbroker Syria in
January. Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
been spearheading a war since 1985 to oust Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
The recent Israeli decision to withdraw from south Lebanon by
July this year, with or without an agreement with Lebanon and
Syria, also failed to ease the tensions.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese leadership said that if Israel pulls out unilaterally,
Lebanon will not guarantee the security for Israel's interest.   
</P>
<P>
Syria, which is seeking the full return of the Golan Height
seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, insists on the
simultaneity in solving the Syria and Lebanon issues.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jordanian Banana Planters Urged to Look at Other Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The influential Jordanian
Agricultural Marketing Corporation (AMC) has urged local banana
planters to plant other crops due to fierce competition from
bananas pouring into the kingdom since it was admitted into the
World Trade Organization in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to a AMC study available on Thursday, the costs of
planting 1,000 square meters of bananas in the kingdom amounted to
700 Jordanian dinars (980 U.S. dollars), as against 630 dinars (882
dollars) for their foreign competitors, mainly from Somalia and
other major banana producers in the world.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that the high costs of planting bananas in the
desert kingdom were mainly due to its high consumption of water,
with 1,700 cubic meters of water for 1,000 square meters of banana
trees each year, which would be enough for planting 5,000 square
meters of other plants.
</P>
<P>
The government, facing a chronic water shortage, is also
encouraging banana farmers to shift to other crops which are more
economic in terms of water.
</P>
<P>
Statistics by the water and agriculture ministry showed that
farmers consume over 70 percent of the total water supplies in the
water-sparse kingdom, and the fact that banana farms consume water
four or five times of other crops has become one of the major
concerns of parliamentarians and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
They said it is preferable to import bananas rather than to
plant them locally given the huge amount of water needed for the
banana trees.
</P>
<P>
However, farmers in the southern Jordan Valley, where most of
the arable land lies, told Xinhua that bananas are profitable
plant, as vegetables and other crops are even more vulnerable to
drought, like the one that hit the kingdom in 1999, the worst in
nearly half a century.
</P>
<P>
The government said the drought last year had cost the country
160 million dinars (224 million dollars), and made a large number
of farmers unable to pay back the loans long due to the government
because of the poor yields of their lands.
</P>
<P>
Currently, local banana farmers are protected by custom duties,
which officials said would soon be cancelled or drastically reduced
as called by rules of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Banana farmers will have to plant other crops anyway because the
imported bananas would be highly competitive in Jordan's markets
after the custom duties are removed, an action that the government
is to take sooner or later, said an official who asked not to be
named.
</P>
<P>
However, the jobs and living standards of thousands of farmers
and their families in the Jordan Valley would be at risk if the
government slashes or cancels import duties on bananas.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Arrested for Threatening Prominent Reformist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A person who sent a recorded threat
to Iran's prominent reformer Saeed Hajjarian before he was shot has
been arrested, the Tehran Times daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The threat was recorded in a cassette and sent to Hajjarian a
few days before he was shot and seriously wounded in front of the
Municipal Council of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The cassette had been made available to the Supreme National
Security Council for investigation, the paper quoted an informed
source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, deputy chairman of the Municipal Council, was shot in
the face by unidentified gunmen on a motorbike last Sunday. Since
then, he has been in a comma in hospital.
</P>
<P>
But doctors treating him said on Wednesday that Hajjarian's
conditions were better and there is growing hope for his survival.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, 46, is a close advisor to reform-minded President
Mohammad Khatami. He also heads the reformist Persian daily Sobh-e
Emruz, which upsets the powerful conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The assassination attempt came as tensions are running high in
the country following the landslide victory of reformers over their
conservative opponents in parliamentary elections last month.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Several dozen Palestinian security prisoners will be released
as a goodwill gesture to the Palestinian National Authority to mark
the Moslem Feast of Eid al-Adha, Israeli security sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the release will take place at the
beginning of next week, probably on Sunday and no more than 50
prisoners will be released. No Hamas activists or terrorists that
murdered Jews will be among them.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian officials said Wednesday night that they are
waiting to receive the list.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli security cabinet and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat Wednesday approved the map of the next Israeli Defense
Forces withdrawal in which 6.1 percent of the West Bank will be
transferred to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
The long-delayed pullback will take place next week. After this
withdrawal, the Palestinians will have full or partial control of
42.9 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The land to be transferred includes villages near Hebron,
Ramallah, Jericho, Bethlehem, and two villages not far from
Jerusalem. The village of Anata bordering Jerusalem, which had
caused a political commotion from the rightists this week, was not
included in the map at last.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Deputy Mossad head Amiram Levine retired Wednesday, after
hearing from Prime Minister Ehud Barak in a meeting Wednesday that
he was not to be appointed head of the intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
Levine was brought into the agency by former prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu over two years ago with the understanding that
he would be promoted to the top post in a year.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The police Wednesday recommended that former public security
minister Avigdor Kahalani be indicted for disrupting the police
investigation of Ma'ariv publisher Ofer Nimrodi.
</P>
<P>
The investigation materials and the indictment recommendations
were passed Wednesday to the State Prosecutor's office so that it
might decide on a course of action.
</P>
<P>
The national fraud squad alleges that Kahalani received
classified information on the Nimrodi probe illegally and leaked it
to Nimrodi and his attorney.

<HEADLINE> 4 NPA Rebels Killed in Central Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Four New People's Army (NPA)
rebels were killed Thursday during an encounter with government
troops in Northern Samar province in the central Philippines, the
military said.
</P>
<P>
A military report said troops of 63rd Infantry Battalion were
conducting security functions early in the morning when they
encountered 20 NPA rebels at Happy Valley village in the province.
</P>
<P>
In the ensuing 5-minute firefight, four rebels were killed,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
It said there was no casualty on the government side and troops
recovered four 16 rifles.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1969, the NPA is one of the major rebel groups in
the country. Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado admitted
recently that the number of NPA rebels has grown from almost a
spent force of 5,000 in 1995 to about 10,000 now.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada said last month that he was
giving the NPA and other rebel groups up to June this year to come
up with peace agreements with the government.

NAIROBI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Seven people died in a bus
accident Wednesday morning in central Kenya after a rear tyre
burst, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The driver was among the dead and another seven people were
admitted into a nearby hospital in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
The vehicles rolled several times before coming to a halt off
the road, according to eyewitnesses.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the bus was overloaded at the time of accident
and warned other bus owners against repeating the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's privately-owned bus sector is notorious for reckless
driving and overloading. A majority of road accidents in Kenya are

<HEADLINE> Roundup: On-line Stock Trading Set to Surge in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China's most popular on-line
securities and financial information provider, the Homeway Co. has
announced that it has formed a strategic partnership with 34 major
securities companies to develop Internet stock trading.
</P>
<P>
Internet stock trading isn't new, but several dealers,
including the Communications Securities Co. (CSC), the Ping An
Securities and others have waited until the past few weeks to
announce their new businesses.
</P>
<P>
The timing of their announcement is no secret in the industry;
regulatory rules on Internet stock trading are widely expected to
be issued by the China Securities Regulatory Commission in the
next few months, thereby legalizing an industry that has been
groping in a regulatory grey area for years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said with the new rules, competition between
securities companies for the vast opportunities ahead would go
public and white-hot, and that the stage is now set for a surge in
Internet stock trading in China.
</P>
<P>
According to a CSC report, more than 20 securities companies,
including almost all the major players in the industry, have
opened stock brokerages on the web.
</P>
<P>
A number of securities websites such as www.stock2000.com.cn,
www.99stock.com and www.stockstar.com now offer online trading
platforms to securities companies.
</P>
<P>
Internet stock trading has great advantages over traditional
trading: Investors working online can have access to financial
news, real-time stock prices, technical charts, analysis of
individual stocks, consult brokers and place orders anytime,
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
For securities companies, it means they no longer need to set
up trading floors in several locations, and thus can significantly
cut costs while at the same time serving more customers and
providing better service.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: On-line Stock Trading Set to Surge in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Huarong Trust and Investment Co. opened the first brokerage in
China to offer Internet stock trading in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The most successful Internet stock broker, however, seems to be
Minfa Securities in the southeast province of Fujian. The company
now reportedly has 7,000 online customers and 20 percent of its
transactions are done on the web.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the biggest brokerages, medium and small-sized
companies often take a more positive attitude towards online
trading: Many of them take online trading as a chance for them to
catch up with the big players.
</P>
<P>
Most of the securities companies chose to put online brokerages
on their own websites. But more recently, many of them have begun
to use platforms offered by popular portals.
</P>
<P>
The idea is to combine brokerage's professional services with
portals' customer groups, so as to change China's increasing
Internet users into stock investors.
</P>
<P>
Though online stock trading still faces several major obstacles
in China, including high prices of telecommunications and Internet
connections, slow line speeds and concerns about Internet security,
many people are optimistic about its future.
</P>
<P>
After years of development, China has established nationwide
telephone and multi-media telecommunications networks. The
penetration of computers and telephones in households is high. The
country's Internet users totaled 8.9 million by the end of 1999
and the figure is expected to double every year.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, online stock trading will be the best
place to start e-commerce in China. They give two reasons: One is
that the absorption of information technology is the highest in
the banking and securities sectors; the second is that online
stock trading does not need a physical distribution system, which
is critical to the success of e-commerce in any other field.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Provide Free Oil for Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 16 (Xinhua) -- In a show of support for Lebanon
which has been in armed conflicts with Israel, Iraq has decided to
provide oil worth 10 million U.S. dollars free of charge for the
country.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by the Revolutionary Command Council,
Iraq's highest power organization, the Iraqi News Agency (INA)
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi people will stand firmly aside with the people of
Lebanon," the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
In retaliation for the Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah's
attacks on its targets, Israel recently launched air raids on
Lebanon's infrastructure, resulting heavy property damage.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Arab foreign ministers wrapped up a meeting in
Beirut with a resolution condemning Israel and urging Arab
countries to reassess their relationship with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The 18-point final resolution of the meeting, read out by Arab
League (AL) Secretary General Ahmed Abdel-Meguid, reprimanded
Israel's continued aggression against Lebanon and affirmed the
organization's support for Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It gave backing to the legitimate Lebanese resistance against
Israel and recognized the simultaneity of the Lebanese and Syrian
tracks in peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The AL decision to choose Beirut to host the foreign ministers'
meeting was to demonstrate support for Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon in
1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks. Since then, Hezbollah has been
spearheading a war to oust the Israeli occupation forces and the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's economic growth rate
slowed to 1.3 percent in 1999 from 1.8 percent in 1998, an
official report has said.
</P>
<P>
In its Monthly Economic Review released Wednesday, the Central
Bank of Kenya said that the economic downturn was attributed to
structural inefficiency and prolonging drought.
</P>
<P>
The central bank forecast the current slowdown to linger in the
short- term due to drought, but to pick up in the second half of
the year, when more abundant rains are expected and current
economic reforms start bearing fruit, the Daily Nation newspaper
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bank also said that Kenya's official foreign exchange
reserves in January stood unchanged from December's 791 million
U.S. dollars, equivalent to three months of import cover.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, Mozambique to Establish Ferry Service on Border River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Mozambique
plan to establish ferry services across the Ruvuma River between
the two countries to ease the transportation problem, Tanzanian
media reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The move will largely facilitate trade activities that have
been hindered by lack of reliable land transport, the Chairman of
Tanzania and Mozambique Friendship Association (TAMOFA) George
Mkuchika was quoted as saying by the Express weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to the chairman, the ferry would be assembled within
two months after the spare parts and other equipment arrived from
Germany. Since TAMOFA launched efforts to help flood victims in
Mozambique by collecting material and financial support from
willing Tanzanians, the ferry services can be used to aid the
flood-hit country.
</P>
<P>
When the ferry project is finished, added the chairman, trade
and social activities between the people of the two countries will
be strengthened.

<HEADLINE> China Eyes Top Three at World Ice Hockey Pool C Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- China aims at finishing in top
three at the World Ice Hockey Pool C Championships to be held from
March 20 to 26 in Beijing, China's head coach Wang Jingang told
reporters in a press conference here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We have set the objective of winning at least the third place
at the tournament thus to earn a berth in the next Pool B
championships." Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese national ice hockey team won the second place at the
Pool C Championships in 1981 and for the first time ascended to
Pool B when Wang served as a contributive player. However, the
Chinese have been playing in Pool C since their relegation from
Pool B after an eighth finish in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The ascending berths to Pool B has been raised from two to four
last year as the International Ice Hockey Federation decided to
increase the number of teams playing in Pool B, which was
considered as a golden opportunity for China, which finished
fourth at the tournament in the last two years, to go back to Pool
B.
</P>
<P>
According to the rules, the nine teams attending the tournament
are divided into three groups and top teams from each group will
vie for the first three places. China has to beat the other two

<P>
"It is a tough job, but we will go all out for it," Wang added.
"We won't make the fans disappointed."
</P>
<P>
Wang told reporters that Lithuania and Yugoslavia are on the
same level with China. As a matter of fact, China has a win, a
lose and a draw against Lithuania in the last two years but had no
matchup for several years with Yugoslavia. "We know very little
about the Yugoslavian team but we will try to beat them."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers to Develop Variety of Farm Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers have begun
growing pollution-free vegetables and fruit to satisfy city
dwellers' desire for healthier food.
</P>
<P>
"There are no pesticides or fertilizers on the vegetables. The
city people will like them," said a grandmother from her family's
greenhouse in rural Liaoning Province in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
Bumper harvests of the past two years have led to reductions
in grain prices, a pleasing turn of events for Chinese farmers who
now also realize that readjusting farming practices to satisfy
consumer demand leads to higher profits.
</P>
<P>
China has great potential in green food development, as there
are so far just 1,000 state-recognized green products nationwide.
The green growing area is only 2.67 million hectares, and output
values stand at 30 billion yuan (about 3.6 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The central government used to encourage grain cultivation by
subsidizing farmers, but the practice has been gradually abolished
in the market economy.
</P>
<P>
With more urban dwellers mindful of daily nutritional needs,
farmers are changing accordingly. And farmers in mountainous areas
in Liaoning have switched to growing mushrooms and ginseng.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is to increase the cultivation area for green
agricultural products to 6.67 million hectares within the next
five years, State-recognized species to more than 80 in the
province with output volume amounting to over 400,000 tons and
exports' value to 15 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> South China's Hainan Sets Tourism Development Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The island province of Hainan in
south China expects to host 10 million travelers and rake in eight
billion yuan (964 million U.S. dollars) from tourism this year.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Hainan hopes to score 10 percent growth in both the
number of overseas tourists and the volume of earnings.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the growth goal, the province estimated it
will host 500,000 overseas tourists and earn 110 million U.S.
dollars from the industry this year, said a provincial tourism
official in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
To build the island into the most popular tropical holiday
resort in Asia and China's tourism giant by the year 2020, Hainan
is bringing in Chinese and overseas tourism industry experts,
including specialists from the World Tourism Organization, to help
formulate a comprehensive tourism plan.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the province will also spend heavily to speed
up construction of high-quality tourism projects, prepare packages
that best reflect Hainan's character, and improve the province's
existing tourism product mix, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Hainan also aims to add a tourist route from Hainan to Viet Nam
and operate regular chartered flights from Hainan to Japan.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government has
clamped a country-wide ban on all political meetings at public
places, strikes and processions.
</P>
<P>
The ban has been imposed with immediate effect beginning on
Wednesday, according to a statement from the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The action is taken "as the country cannot afford the luxury of
agitation and violence-prone politics which disrupt the normal
public life," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the main objective of the move is the restoration
of order and harmony in society with a view to providing security
and prosperity to citizens.
</P>
<P>
There are reports, the statement said, that elements working
against the interests of the state are preparing and planning
hostile acts to create chaos and portray Pakistan as an
irresponsible state.
</P>
<P>
"The government has made a solemn commitment to the restoration
of a responsible democratic order. A manifestation of this
commitment is the holding of elections of local bodies at the end
of this year," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry urged all political and religious parties to "
exhibit responsible behavior, curb unruly elements within their
ranks and keep a watch on the intrusion of hostile foreign
elements."

<HEADLINE> Export Mix Improved in Fujian Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The electro-machinery export mix
has been further improving in east China's Fujian Province, a
result of the growing shipments of hi-tech and hi-value-added
products against the dropping volume in export of labor-intensive
goods.
</P>
<P>
Last year Fujian exported nearly 3.22 billion US dollars of
electro-machinery, accounting for 4.18 percent of the nation's
total and growing by 24.9 percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Each of the 36 types of products registered an export value of
more than 10 million US dollars last year. Those products include
ships, aircraft and parts, monitors, transformers, lighting
equipment and electric toys.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded enterprises contribute significantly to the
improved export mix. Some three-fourths of the local electro-
machinery exports are now handled by foreign-funded enterprises.

<HEADLINE> China Reclaims Used Batteries to Protect Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, China's largest and
youngest municipality, has launched a campaign to reclaim used
batteries to protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of Chongqing citizens have been at work since
Sunday collecting used batteries and putting them into special
bins set up throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday alone, over 25,000 batteries were reclaimed,
according to local environmental protection departments.
</P>
<P>
A local paging company has planned to invest 8 million yuan (
960,000 U.S. dollars) on a swap project in which people hand in
their used batteries for new and eco-friendly ones.
</P>
<P>
China is world's biggest battery producer and battery user. It
produced 14 billion batteries in 1998, accounting for 46.7 percent
of the world's total in the year.
</P>
<P>
Experts say mercury and zinc from batteries can pollute water
and soil, and are health hazards. One battery can pollute 0.5 sq.
meters of soil, and some 8.5 million sq. meters of soil in China
were polluted by used batteries every year.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Targets USD300 Mln Export of Frozen Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh may earn 300 million U.S.
dollars through exporting frozen fish in the current fiscal year,
the Financial Express reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
To create more global markets for the export-oriented frozen
fish and to achieve the export target, three Bangladeshi
delegations are now visiting Europe, the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted officials of the Export Promotion Bureau as
saying that out of the export-oriented sectors of the country,
only the frozen fish sector is set to reach the export target.
</P>
<P>
Up to last December, import orders for the frozen fish exceeded
their export target while the garments, jute, tea and other export
sectors are lagging behind.
</P>
<P>
The United States is one of the main buyers of the frozen fish
exported by Bangladesh, absorbing some 35 percent of the total.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Team Arrives in Cambodia for Tribunal Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 16 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. negotiation team
arrived here Thursday for a final talk on how to resolve
differences between the U.N. and the Cambodian government on the
trial of former Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
Hans Corell, the U.N.'s legal counsel who led the team, told
reporters upon their arrival at the airport that the U.N. team
came here to work hard with the Cambodian government on the draft
law on the Khmer Rouge trial.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N.'s participation in the trial is on the basis
of the "assistance" request put forward by the then co-Prime
Ministers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that Cambodia is a sovereignty country, Corell
said his team is ready to solve the differences through hard work
and consultation. But he did not disclose whether the U.N. would
make a compromise.
</P>
<P>
Among the seven members of the team is Lakhan Mehrotra, who
once served as Annan's political representative in Cambodia for
more than two years until his mandate expired last year.
</P>
<P>
The group was dispatched by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to hammer out the details of how to conduct a trial of former
Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
The remaining issues are sticky, but observers here believe
that if the two sides ever will reach an agreement, they will do
it now.
</P>
<P>
The differences remaining now are four key issues, including
who will appoint the prosecutors and the judges; who will name the
suspects in the trial; whether all those suspects will be arrested
and how many former Khmer Rouge leaders will be tried.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the government has talked tough with the U.N., but
according to the Cambodia Daily's analysis, the movements over the
last few months have indicated officials are poised for compromise.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team will stay here until March, 22.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Parliament Passes Referendum Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian House of Commons
Wednesday passed a controversial bill tabled by the federal
government in December to make secession attempts more difficult.
</P>
<P>
The bill passed with 208 votes for and 55 against, after the
third and final reading, and will become law after winning Senate
approval.
</P>
<P>
The marathon voting session, which began on Monday, lasted more
than 30 hours. Canadian MPs sat day and night voting in turn on a
total of 411 amendments to the bill introduced by the ruling
Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
The Bloc Quebecois, the only party uniformly opposed to the
bill, proposed as many as 403 amendments in a bid to stall the
bill, which requires that Quebec must win a clear majority from a
clearly-worded question before it can separate from Canada.
</P>
<P>
The House of Commons adopted two amendments during the voting
session to give aboriginal peoples a say on referendum results.
</P>
<P>
Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Stephane Dion said after
voting, "Every Canadian will have the guarantee that the
government of Canada will never enter into negotiations on the
separation of a province unless the population of that province
has clearly expressed its will to cease to be part of Canada."
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that the question posed in the 1995
Quebec referendum was unclear and that such a question would not
lead to negotiations on secession in the future even with a
majority of votes.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Conduct Survey for Sea Oil Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will conduct its second
geological survey after a lapse of two decades to explore
prospective oil deposits in the sea territories, the state-owned
Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which uses satellite-based remote sensing and
computer technology, will be carried out by the CPC in September
this year with the assistance of the Petroscan Company of Sweden,
said a CPC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka conducted its first oil reserve survey from 1974 to
1981 with the assistance of some American and Russian oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
The second survey is to be conducted within the exclusive
economic zone covering an area of around 302,500 square kms in the
Indian ocean, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
It will mostly concentrate on the sea north, northwest and
northeast of Sri Lanka which are prospective areas close to oil
wells in the south Indian region.
</P>
<P>
Following the survey, the CPC is expected to conduct an
exploration promotion campaign, encouraging international
companies to invest in oil exploration in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
For the moment, only seven wells have been drilled in the
country to look for oil. Four wells were drilled in the offshore
areas with the assistance of an American oil company. A Russian
oil company drilled the other three onshore wells.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Premier Zhu's Government Work Report (31) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We must work energetically to promote the re-employment of laid-
off workers. Local authorities should help these workers change
their ideas about what kind of job they are seeking, work hard to
create jobs, develop vocational training programs for laid-off
workers, and help more of them find new jobs as soon as possible.
Governments at all levels and concerned departments should
cooperate whole-heartedly in strengthening supervision and
inspection to ensure the full implementation of the various
policies concerning re-employment. Whenever possible, enterprises
should be encouraged and advised to separate their main and
secondary business activities, find other positions for their
redundant workers within the enterprise, and set up new economic
entities with independent accounting and responsibility for
profits and losses to absorb redundant workers. Career counseling
and placement services should be provided to assist workers from
closed-down and bankrupt state-owned enterprises to find suitable
new positions.
</P>
<P>
While working to carry out the above, we should advance reforms
to gradually form a social security system with Chinese
characteristics which is independent of the employer, has
diversified funding sources and has management and services not
provided by the employer. First, the coverage of social welfare
insurance programs should be expanded in accordance with the law,
and the insurance premium collection rate raised. Social welfare
insurance, particularly old-age, unemployment and medical
insurance, must be made mandatory in urban areas. This is an
important way to increase social security funds and at the same
time an important prerequisite for instituting a new system. At
the same time, expenditures in the central and local budgets at
all levels must be appropriately restructured to increase the
proportion of social security spending. Various measures should be
adopted to open up new funding channels to supplement social
security funds. Second, we should improve the unemployment
insurance system and speed up the development of the labor market.
The current practice of enterprise re-employment centers
guaranteeing the basic cost of living allowances to laid-off
workers should be changed to laid-off workers receiving
unemployment insurance benefits and looking for jobs in the labor
market. This work will begin on a trial basis in our eastern
coastal areas and in cities with the necessary conditions. After
the results of these trials are analyzed, the new practice will be
gradually introduced to other areas. Third, non-employer
management of old-age insurance programs should be promoted to
gradually shift responsibility for retirees from their former
employers to society at large and effect non-employer payment of
old-age pensions as soon as possible. We should conduct trials of
community-administrated programs for retirees. We should exercise
more effective leadership and management of communities and
improve their function as service providers. At the same time, it
is important to ensure continuity in our work during the
changeover to the new social security system.

Strengthening national defense and building up the army are
important guarantees for the security of the country and the
success of the modernization drive. We should energetically
support efforts to improve the quality of the People's Liberation
Army, continuing to strengthen the army through science and
technology and upgrading its weapons and equipment. We should
improve the army's defense capabilities and combat effectiveness,
fully taking into consideration modern technology, especially high
technology. We should strengthen the reform, restructuring and
development efforts of the national defense-related technology
industry. Reform of the national defense mobilization system
should be continued and the militia and the reserves strengthened.
National defense education should become more widespread to raise
the people's awareness of the importance of national defense. Good
arrangements should be made for demobilized service men and women.
Extensive activities should be launched to encourage the
government and the people to support the army and give
preferential treatment to families of service personnel and
martyrs and the army to support the government and cherish the
people. The army and the people should work together to promote
cultural and ethical progress. All this will consolidate and
develop the unity between the army and the government and between
the army and the people. Further, the people's armed police and
the public security and state security organs should be
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
This year the government will formulate the Tenth Five-Year
Plan for National Economic and Social Development. This will be
the first five-year plan to be formulated under our fledgling
socialist market economy and during the implementation of the
third strategic step of the modernization drive. This plan will
have an important bearing on the overall economic and social
development in China at the beginning of the 21st century. All
localities and departments should pay special attention to this
work and strive to do it well.

We must practice strict economy and combat extravagance and
waste. In the present changing circumstances, we should continue
to carry forward our fine tradition of building the country and
handling all affairs through diligence and frugality. Governments
and functionaries at all levels must have an awareness of hardship
and maintain a sense of frugality, always keeping in mind the
interests of the country and the people. We must resolutely put an
end to the extravagance, waste and squandering seen in some areas,
departments and institutions. Governments at all levels should
continue to implement relevant regulations to curb expansion or
construction of office buildings, not allowing any new luxury
building projects to be launched. Departments under the State
Council should play an exemplary role in this regard. Cases of
misuse of public funds and institutional spending in violation of
relevant regulations must be strictly investigated and prosecuted.
Government officials travel, entertain and dine in a luxurious
style at public expenses in the name of all sorts of invented
activities such as "festival" celebrations, ribbon-cutting
ceremonies and standards inspections. This wastes money and
manpower and arouses the indignation of the people. Such practices
must be resolutely stopped.
</P>
<P>
We should further transform the functions of the government and
carry forward reform of government institutions. Departments under
the State Council should consolidate the results of institutional
reform. Local governments should intensify their institutional
reform in line with the arrangements and requirements of the
central authorities. We should streamline our administration and
establish a highly-efficient, well-coordinated and standardized
administrative system and operating mechanism through reform.
Government institutions should perform their duties in strict
accordance with the limits of authority and procedures as
prescribed by law, and institute and improve a system of work
responsibility. We should strengthen publicity and education about
law. According to the requirements set by the CPC Central
Committee, all the departments under the State Council and
governments at provincial and prefectural levels should
consolidate their achievements in the education about the
importance of studying, being political-minded and being honest
and upright. Rectification measures should be implemented in
earnest. In addition, this education should be carefully carried
out at the county level. Governments and government functionaries
at all levels should bear in mind that they are servants of the
people. They should maintain close ties with the masses, listen to
their opinions and show concern for their weal and woe. We should
especially show our concern these days for those who are
experiencing difficulties in their life and do everything possible
to help them overcome their difficulties. We should continue to
improve and exercise a civil service system and enhance the
political integrity and professional competence of public servants.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels must conscientiously subject
themselves to the supervision of the people's congresses at the
corresponding levels and their standing committees, take the
initiative to strengthen contacts with the committees of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference at all levels,
and earnestly listen to the views of the non-Communist parties,
federations of industry and commerce, prominent persons without
party affiliation and mass organizations. We should make
government affairs public, encourage people to exercise
supervision over the work of the government and its functionaries
in accordance with the law, and bring the supervisory role of
public opinion into full play.

Sino-U.S. relations suffered a severe setback in the first half
of last year. President Jiang Zemin's meeting with US President
Bill Clinton in Auckland helped improve the bilateral relations.
The two countries concluded a bilateral agreement on China's entry
into the World Trade Organization, facilitating economic and trade
cooperation between the two countries and the development of
bilateral relations. The Sino-Russian strategic partnership of
cooperation was enriched with the broad consensus reached during
the summit meetings between the heads of state and government of
the two countries. The two European tours taken by President Jiang
Zemin and the meetings between Chinese and EU leaders promoted the
development of Sino-European relations. In a spirit of keeping in
mind the past and looking toward the future, China is following up
on the important consensus and agreements reached by Chinese and
Japanese leaders. However, we must keep up our guard against the
attempts of a handful of ultra-right forces in Japan to obstruct
and undermine Sino-Japanese relations. China's mutually beneficial
cooperation with other developed countries also continued to
improve.
</P>
<P>
China actively participated in multilateral diplomatic
activities and resolutely defended the purposes and principles of
the UN Charter and the dominant role of the UN in maintaining
world peace and development. China took a clear-cut stand against
the fallacy of "human rights above sovereignty" and other "neo-
interventionist" fallacies, thus presenting a positive image to
the world of a country which adheres to principles, upholds
justice, safeguards peace and promotes development. We foiled the
anti-China human rights draft resolution in the United Nations for
the eighth time and shattered Taiwan's seventh attempt to "return
to the United Nations". China's international standing continued
to rise.

In the year 2000, China is still facing more opportunities than
challenges and more hopes than difficulties in terms of the global
climate. We will continue to follow Deng Xiaoping's thinking on
diplomatic work, adhere to an independent foreign policy of peace,
oppose hegemonism, safeguard world peace and resolutely defend our
state sovereignty and territorial integrity. We will strive for a
long-term peaceful international environment and good surrounding
environment for our socialist modernization drive. We will
unswervingly take the strengthening of unity and cooperation with
other developing countries as a basic principle underlying China's
foreign policy. We will continue to maintain friendly good-
neighborly relations and further consolidate and strengthen all-
round cooperation with neighboring countries. Intensified efforts
will be made to strengthen cooperation characterized by equality
and mutual benefit with developed countries on the basis of the
Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. China will continue to
play an active and constructive role in the global multilateral
arena. We stand ready to work hand in hand with the people of all
countries to press forward with the establishment of a peaceful,
stable, just and reasonable new international political and
economic order, promote the development of the trend toward multi-

This year we will have formidable tasks in carrying out reform
and development and maintaining stability, but there are also many
favorable conditions that will enable us to make our work a
success. Let us rally more closely around the CPC Central
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, hold high the
great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, adhere to the basic line of
the Party, seize the opportunities, blaze new trails in a
pioneering and confident spirit, work diligently and carry forward
in an all-round manner the cause of reform and opening up and the

Efforts should be made to deepen the reform of education and
work to improve the overall quality of students. All types of
schools at all levels should strengthen moral education among
their students, help them develop practical abilities and a spirit
of innovation, and effectively reduce too heavy homework
assignments for primary and secondary school students to ensure
that they improve in terms of their moral, intellectual and
fitness level as well as in their appreciation of aesthetics.
Goals in the effort to make nine-year compulsory education
basically universal in the country and to eliminate illiteracy
among young and middle-aged people should be attained on schedule.
Efforts should be made to further develop senior secondary school
education, higher education and all types of vocational education.
Enrollment in regular institutions of higher learning should be
increased, and the practical problems of student dormitories,
cafeterias and teaching facilities should be resolved by gradually
making such services independent in their operation. Personal
loans to finance education should be vigorously promoted. More
channels should be opened to create jobs for graduates from
institutions of higher learning. Efforts should be made to develop
schools not operated by government education departments. Modern
information technology should be used to develop distance
education. Reform of the management system for education should be
continued. Except for the Ministry of Education and a small number
of special departments, other departments under the State Council
will no longer directly manage schools in an effort to form a new
system under which schools are run by governments at both the
central and provincial levels, with most schools managed by local
governments. Restructuring of the internal management of schools
should be deepened and close attention should be paid to
ideological and political work in the schools. The quality of the
teaching staff should be improved in an all-round way. Efforts to
provide coordinated support for educational undertakings in
poverty-stricken areas should be stepped up.

V. Accelerating the Development of Science, Technology and
Education and Promoting Cultural and Ethical Progress
</P>
<P>
The strategy of developing China through science and education
and the strategy of sustainable development should be vigorously
followed in promoting economic restructuring, enhancing the
overall quality of the economy and furthering coordinated economic
and social development.
</P>
<P>
Great efforts should be made to develop and spread the use of
high and new technology that can play a crucial role in upgrading
our traditional industries and can be widely applied. Outstanding
scientific and technical personnel should be encouraged to help in
upgrading technology in enterprises and in the utilization and
modification of imported equipment and technology related to key
projects. Application of high and new technology to production
should be stepped up, with efforts focused on creating a number of
competitive products and supporting enterprises which apply high
and new technology. The successful operation of national high and
new technology industrial development zones should be continued.
Efforts to develop a state innovation system should be
strengthened. Greater emphasis should be placed on strengthening
basic research and high technology research efforts by supporting
a contingent of highly qualified, top-notch researchers to focus
on making pioneering advances in these fields. Efforts to promote
reform of the management system for science and technology should
continue. Applied research institutes and other research
institutes studying projects with market potential should be
turned into enterprises or work with enterprises to strengthen
their technology development efforts. In addition, great efforts
should be made to carry out trial reforms of research institutes
working for the public good. Efforts should be made to promote the
integration of production, teaching and research in a variety of
ways. The protection and management of intellectual property
should be strengthened. Investment in science, technology and
education should be increased and return on investment should be
enhanced. Vigorous efforts should be made to develop philosophy
and social sciences. Workers engaged in the fields of philosophy
and social sciences should carefully study the major theoretical
and practical problems arising in the process of reform and
opening up and the modernization drive in order to better serve
the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. (

Governments at all levels should adhere to the principle of "
doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to each" and
pay very close attention to and strengthen socialist cultural and
ethical progress. Close attention should be paid to the
development of science and culture while serious efforts are also
being made to promote ideological and ethical progress. Efforts to
promote patriotism, collectivism and socialism should be continued
to help foster in the masses, especially the young, the correct
values and outlook on the world and life and give them a firm
faith in the ideal of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics. Mass participation activities should be
extensively launched to promote cultural and ethical progress. The
scientific spirit should be encouraged throughout society by
spreading the use of scientific methods, introducing scientific
knowledge to the public and combating ignorance and superstition.
Literature and art, the press and publishing, and the radio, film
and television industries should be allowed to flourish, while at
the same time they should be required to maintain the correct
orientation for public opinion and create more literary and
artistic works that are excellent both ideologically and
artistically. Work to protect cultural relics and archives should
be strengthened. Great efforts should be made to develop cultural
facilities, improve and rectify the entertainment industry and the
market for audio-visual products and publications, and strengthen
the management of the market for cultural products. The fight
against pornography, illegal publications and piracy should
continue. Healthy and civilized lifestyles should be promoted, and
varied and interesting cultural and sports activities should be
developed for the participation of the masses.

The system of income distribution giving preferential treatment
to outstanding personnel should be reformed and improved to
establish an incentive mechanism. Special measures should be
adopted to improve the working and living conditions of scientific
and technical personnel who work for the state in key fields and
hold important positions. In addition, effective policy measures
should be taken to encourage and attract students studying
overseas and outstanding personnel residing abroad to come home to
work in China.
</P>
<P>
We should continue to follow a path of sustainable development.
We should further strengthen family planning, striving to
stabilize the low birth rate and promote good prenatal and
postnatal care, and devoting strong efforts to the management of
family planning and related services in rural areas and among the
floating population. More work should be done in the area of care
for senior citizens. The various programs to help the physically
and mentally challenged deserve our concern and support. The
programs for the development of work concerning women and children
should be earnestly implemented. Efforts to bring urban
environmental pollution under control should be intensified,
focusing on projects to prevent and control environmental
pollution in major cities, valleys, regions and coastal areas and
striving to achieve the goals set for environmental protection and
pollution control. Urban and rural areas should be properly
planned. The management of natural resources should be
strengthened, and efforts should be made to protect and make
rational use of land, forest, grassland, mineral, marine and water
resources in accordance with the law. Work in public health and
sports should be further improved with close attention paid to
disease prevention and control, strengthening urban community
health services and rural primary health care, and raising the
overall physical fitness level of the public.

VI. Opening Wider to the Outside World
</P>
<P>
The overall trend in the world's economic and trade situation
is getting better. The process of China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) has been accelerated. We must take a more
active stance in opening China wider to the outside world, seizing
new opportunities and meeting new challenges. We will be taking
more effective measures in 2000 to promote the expansion of
foreign trade and utilize more foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
The strategy of success through quality and market
diversification should be continued, and relevant policies should
be implemented to expand exports. First, the mix of exports should
be adjusted by increasing the proportion of electromechanical
products, accelerating the upgrading and updating of such
traditional export commodities as textiles, garments and other
light industrial products, and working to increase the proportion
of high-tech products. Agricultural exports should also be
increased. Second, we should work actively to open up more markets
abroad. In particular, strong efforts should be made to open up
emerging markets in Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe and the
Commonwealth of Independent States, and actions should be taken to
develop economic and trade relations with neighboring countries
and other developing countries. Chinese enterprises which are
relatively strong should be encouraged to make investments and set
up factories abroad, engage in processing trade and exploit
natural resources through cooperative agreements. Overseas
contracted projects and labor services should be further expanded.
Third, reform of the foreign trade system should be deepened.
Foreign trade enterprises should set up management mechanisms for
expanding access to international markets and improve their
internal management. More producers should be allowed to engage in
export on their own. The number of types of export commodities
subject to voluntary quotas should be reduced and quota management
and bidding methods should be improved. The mix of imports should
be optimized and the import of the key equipment, technology and
major raw and semi-finished materials which are urgently needed in
the country should be increased. E-business should be promptly
studied and promoted.

We should utilize foreign funds effectively. The spheres of
activity and geographical regions open to foreign businesses
should be expanded. Commerce, foreign trade, banking, insurance,
securities, telecommunications, tourism and intermediary services
should gradually be opened to the outside world. Restrictions on
foreign investment pertaining to technology transfer, the
proportion of products to be sold domestically and share of
holdings in some industries should be relaxed. Foreign businesses
should be encouraged to invest in agriculture, infrastructure
development, the environmental protection industry, and high and
new technology industries. Vigorous efforts should be made to
attract investment from transnational corporations, especially in
research and development and in the reorganization and
technological upgrading of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
We must lose no time in adjusting to the new situation created
by the accelerated process of China's entry into WTO. All trades
and professions and all enterprises should work to strengthen
their competitiveness and ability to handle risks by accelerating
reform, strengthening management and raising the level of
technology. In addition, we should lose no time in revising and
improving relevant laws and regulations and step up our efforts to
train various types of special personnel.

VII. Developing a Social Security System to Maintain Social
Stability
</P>
<P>
The establishment and development of a social security system
has an overall impact on reform, development and stability. This
is an endeavor of great significance which requires our most
diligent efforts to ensure its success. For the present we need to
continue implementing and improving the system of "three
guarantees" - guarantee of basic cost of living allowances for
workers laid off from state-owned enterprises, guarantee of
unemployment insurance benefits and guarantee of subsistence
allowances for urban residents. On this basis, we must work to
create the necessary conditions for the transition to a sound
social security system.
</P>
<P>
The operation of re-employment service centers for state-owned
enterprises must be further improved. These centers should pay
basic living expenses to laid-off workers on schedule and in full
and pay the premiums for the social welfare insurance of these
workers, including old-age, unemployment and medical insurance.
The funds needed should be secured according to a principle of "
three-thirds". The shortage in funds remaining after the
enterprises and society make their respective contributions should
be covered by the state budget. Allocations from the central
government budget will continue to support the central and western
regions and old industrial bases whose financial problems are
truly serious. All local authorities should guarantee the basic
cost of living allowances for workers laid off from state-owned
enterprises under the central government and work to find
employment for them, incorporating this work into their overall
local planning and regulating the allocation of funds raised by
society as needed. Effective measures must be taken to ensure that
retirees from state-owned enterprises receive their basic old-age
pension payments on time and in full, with no more payments
falling into arrears. Local authorities must strengthen
supervision and management over social security funds and strictly
adhere to separate management of revenue and expenditures to
ensure that funds are used for the specified purposes only.
Efforts to recover funds diverted in the past should be
strengthened and cases of misappropriation must be severely
punished.

The central authorities' guiding principles and policies on the
reform of the grain distribution system should be further
implemented. The government will continue to purchase surplus
grain from farmers at protective prices without limit. The policy
of setting higher prices for better quality grain products should
be conscientiously implemented to promote improvement in the mix
of grain varieties. The State Council has decided to exclude some
varieties of grain from price protection in line with supply and
demand, and the need to improve the mix of grain varieties, and
government policy should be adjusted accordingly. Sustained
efforts in this area should be focused on reform of state-owned
enterprises engaged in grain purchase and marketing, promoting of
the separation of government functions from enterprise management,
changing the way enterprises are operated and reducing costs as
much as possible. We should review our experience in this field
and improve our policies and measures for the reform of the grain
distribution system.
</P>
<P>
The reforms of finance, taxation, banking, investment, funding,
income distribution and the circulation of goods should continue
to proceed in an orderly fashion. The central authorities have
formulated guidelines for the reform of urban housing, medical
insurance, pharmaceuticals and health care. Governments of all
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under
the central government should make their own decisions and
arrangements in this regard in light of local conditions.

The central authorities have defined the major policies on
reform and development, and a number of important laws and
regulations have been promulgated. To ensure that these policies,
state laws and regulations are observed to the letter, it is
imperative that management be tightened, putting strict observance
above all else. The time has come when we must take decisive
action against sloppy management, indiscipline and disorder, which
have become rampant in production, construction and circulation of
goods, as well as against the lax execution of laws, decrees and
regulations seen in some localities and government departments.
These problems seriously hinder the implementation of the guiding
principles and policies of the central authorities and the
progress of various reforms. All departments under the State
Council and local governments at all levels should make it a
priority this year to improve their administration in the spirit
of reform. Institutions and enterprises in all sectors, including
industry, agriculture, finance, taxation, banking, trade, science,
technology, education, culture and public health, should also make
great efforts to improve their management. Better management
encompasses both strengthened supervision and rectification of
problems.

Indiscipline in financial and economic affairs cannot be
tolerated, and administration of these areas must be strict. The
transparency and restraining power of budgets need to be enhanced.
Supervision and auditing of budget implementation should be
improved. The Accounting Law should be strictly enforced to
improve the quality of accounting data. Taxes should be levied in
accordance with the law. In order to safeguard the integrity and
authority of tax laws, no officials should overstep their power by
offering tax reductions or exemptions; overdue tax payments should
be collected and accounts settled in accordance with the law; and
more efforts should be devoted to cracking down on cases of tax
evasion, tax fraud or refusal to pay taxes. The management,
supervision and inspection of both the collection and use of funds
for government revenue need to be tightened to put extrabudgetary
funds under legal control. A vigorous review of all government
fees should be conducted to eliminate arbitrary charges. More work
should be done to strengthen supervision over financial
institutions. In particular, effective measures should be taken to
strengthen supervision and regulation of leading cadres and key
professionals in financial institutions. Efforts to clean up and
reorganize financial institutions engaged in illegal activities
and those with serious problems should continue. Foreign exchange
management should be improved. Good order should be maintained in
public credit transactions and good settlement discipline ensured.
Loans should be repaid and interest collected in accordance with
the law, and debts owed to other enterprises should be paid off.
Accounting firms and other intermediary institutions should be put
in order and standardized. Administrative supervision and audit
supervision should be strengthened by taking full advantage of the
roles of supervisory and auditing departments.

Basically speaking, in order to bring about comprehensive
improvement in management, the economic order in our socialist
market economy must be standardized and safeguarded in accordance
with the law, and various types of scientific management systems
and mechanisms must be instituted and improved. Officials in all
industries and institutions must set high and strict standards,
uncover problems in administration and management and take prompt
action to improve management and supervision by establishing rules
and regulations and changing mechanisms. Leading cadres at all
levels must adhere to principles and not be afraid of offending
anybody in working to improve management. They must also adopt
effective means and measures in light of the new conditions

<P>
Scientific management of enterprises should be conscientiously
strengthened. All enterprises should have strict internal
management, improve their quality, and pay close attention to
weakness in their cost management, fund management and quality
control. They should formulate correct strategies for enterprise
development, technological innovation and marketing in line with
changes in both domestic and world markets. They should rely on
their employees and bring their initiative into full play. They
should also improve their system of democratic management and make
enterprise affairs more transparent. In particular, the basic work
of enterprise management needs to be improved to end practices
seen in some enterprises such as keeping bogus account books and
the reporting of inaccurate figures and distorted information, and
to put an end to fraud and deception. All enterprises should
attach great importance to operating safety and take effective
measures to promptly eliminate hidden hazards. They should work to
establish and improve various rules and regulations and strictly
implement the responsibility system for all posts. Senior
managerial staff of all state-owned enterprises should
conscientiously implement the regulations on honesty and self-
discipline, and resolutely resist and oppose all kinds of
corruption.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Plantation Owners Given 2 Weeks to Put Out Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Environment Minister
Sonny Keraf Wednesday gave plantation owners two weeks to
extinguish fires in Sumatera and Kalimantan islands.
</P>
<P>
He said efforts to curb fires which usually occur in the short
dry season (February and March) had not yielded effective results
partly because of people's poor awareness of the impact of smog.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the people had not taken an active part in curbing
the forest and woodland fires, and had very much depended on fire
fighters, he was quoted by the Antara News Agency Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Coordinating Minister for People's Welfare and
Poverty Eradication Basri Hasanuddin said the government is
planning to set up a law-enforcement team to help handle forest
and woodland fires.
</P>
<P>
The team would immediately work and announce the names of
plantation companies and forest concession holders found using
fires to clear land, he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of hotspots reached a record high of 714 on March 5
from the 34 on February 28. Nearly 515 of them were found in Riau
and 118 in North Sumatera.
</P>
<P>
The drastic increase in the number of hotspots was attributable
to the declining intensity of rains in the past two weeks.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Australian Economy Posts Growth Unrivaled in 30 Years  By Qi Zijian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Australian federal Treasurer
Peter Costello Wednesday presented a picture of a robust economy,
saying the country is enjoying a growth unrivaled in the past 30
years.
</P>
<P>
Figures released on Wednesday by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics showed that the economy grew by 4.3 percent in 1999 and
has been growing at above 4 percent for the past 11 consecutive
quarters.
</P>
<P>
"We have the capacity, I believe, in the future to sustain
growth rates of up to 4 percent, which is not something we've been
able to sustain in the past," Costello said.
</P>
<P>
The economy's better-than-expected performance would add
hundreds of millions of Australian dollars to the budget surplus
this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Figures showed that rising exports, government spending,
especially defence spending on East Timor mission, and strong
consumer spending boosted the economy by 1 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Costello tried to dispel perceptions of Australia as
an "old economy" based on commodities and regarded it more as a "
new economy" based on new technology industries, a move aimed at
currency traders who in recent months have sold down the
Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
"The view that Australia is just a farm and a quarry is
completely outmoded," he said, pointing to the fact that the
country's communications sector is now as big as mining and bigger
than agriculture, and the finance sector was bigger than both.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter of 1999, Australia's communications,
manufacturing and property and business services sectors recorded
the strongest growth.
</P>
<P>
The so-called new-economy sectors did best in the quarter, with
communications services posting 4.5 percent growth, the best
result for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
In the 12 months to December 1999, several sectors achieved
double-digit growth, with the communications sector surging 17.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, during the year, manufacturing was relatively flat,
growing by just 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although the economy is well into its ninth year of expansion,
its longest since the 1960s, some economists raised concerns over
both the figures and the economy's future.
</P>
<P>
The country's peak industry association questioned whether the
4.3 percent growth rate was as healthy as it appeared.
</P>
<P>
Steve Kate, chief economist with Australian Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, said the sector-by-sector breakdown of the national
accounts pointed to serious problems.
</P>
<P>
"Private sector investment was shocking and I think the signal
is there for worse to come," he said. "If you take out public
expenditure, the combined private sector contributions actually
show a contraction in the economy."
</P>
<P>
Many analysts agreed that if there were concerns over the
composition of the national accounts figures, it was in the
disappointing performance by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The shadow Labor Party Treasurer Simon Crean said the figures
highlighted an imbalance between consumption and investment,
adding that investment remained a "major concern" for the economy.
</P>
<P>
Another problem on the horizon is the weakness of the
Australian dollar and its potential to prompt further interest
rate rises.
</P>
<P>
Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Ian McFarlane indicated this
week that the bank might lift official interest rates again to
combat growing pressure on prices and help a weak Australian
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Some of the financial market economists said Wednesday's
national accounts for the three months to December did nothing to
dissuade them that interest rates would rise again in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
They warned that the economy is operating at the upper limits
of its capacity and further interest rate increases are needed to
keep inflation at bay.

<HEADLINE> Austria to Compensate Ukrainian Forced Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero
Waldner announced Wednesday that Austria will make compensations
for those Ukrainians who were forced to work in Austria during
World War II, the Austrian Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Waldner told his visiting Ukrainian counterpart Borys Tarasiuk
that the Austrian government has made the decision to pay all
Ukrainians forced to labor in Austria during that time.
</P>
<P>
According to a committee's investigation report, about 40,000
out of 240,000 forced laborers still alive are Ukrainians.
</P>
<P>
Tarasiuk expressed his appreciation of this commitment in a
press conference after the meeting, saying it has brought about
positive reactions in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Tarasiuk also discussed bilateral relations and exchanged views
on recent political and economic situations in both countries with
President of the Austrian National Council Heinz Fischer during
their meeting Wednesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic: KFOR Proved Incapable to Protect Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavian President Slobodan
Milosevic Wednesday blamed the U.N. Interim Administration Mission
in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the international peace-keeping force (KFOR)
for failure to protect Serbs and other non-Albanian civilians in
the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The international community has been let down by UNMIK and
KFOR," Milosevic was quoted by Tanjug as saying. He made the
statement at a meeting of the General Staff of the Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
"Backed by UNMIK and KFOR's appeasement policy, Albanian
extremists continue conducting violent acts against Kosovo non-
Albanians in spite of the international civilian and military
presence in Kosovo," Milosevic noted. "Apparently, UNMIK and KFOR
are carrying out the hegemonism policy of the U.S. under a U.N.
flag."
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavian President then urged an immediate replacement
of KFOR with Yugoslavian police and armed forces in order to
safeguard all ethnic groups in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the heroic performance made by the armed forces
during NATO's air-strike campaign last year, Yugoslavian General
Chief of Staff Nebojsha Pavkovic said that during the most serious
test since World War Two, the armed forces had fought up with
laudable patriotism and had collected valuable experience.

<HEADLINE> Colombia's Rebel Group Threatens to End Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) warned Wednesday that if the government won't
commit to stopping paramilitary activities in the country, it
would "definitively" halt peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
FARC spokesman Raul Reyes, who described the paramilitary
activity as "practiced by the fascist sector of the army, funded
by some politicians, landholders and entrepreneurs", charged that
the "paramilitary policy continues."
</P>
<P>
Reyes, one of the main negotiators of FARC with the government
of President Andres Pastrana, threatened that if the rightist
armed groups continue their activities, FARC could definitively
put an end to the "progress made in the dialogue with Senor
Pastrana, and if that occurs, it is his responsibility."
</P>
<P>
He said that FARC, the biggest and oldest guerrilla
organization in Colombia, "cannot see a political attitude of
serious commitment by the present government to eradicate such a
scourge."
</P>
<P>
The paramilitaries, who field an estimated 6,000 fighters
across Colombia, have been killing leftists and suspected rebel
sympathizers for more than a decade.

<HEADLINE> Uruguayan Industry Shrinks 8.6 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, March 15 (Xinhua) -- The Uruguayan manufacturing
industry lost 8.6 percent in 1999, compared to the previous year,
said the National Statistics Institute (INE) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguayan economy fell by 3 percent in 1999, due to the
Brazilian devaluation, with a budget deficit of 3.5 percent of the
gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The INE statistics show that with the exception of the food
industry, which grew by 3 percent, all manufacturing branches
decreased in the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The division that experienced the greatest losses was in
nonmetallic minerals, which diminished 28.1 percent, followed by
metallic minerals and materials, with a 21.6 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
The chemical industry dropped 13.9 percent, and paper and
printing dropped 10.8 percent, while textiles lost 10.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Train Transporting Butane Gas Derails in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of residents were
evacuated Wednesday from their homes in Mexico's Baja California
State where a train pulling butane gas tanks derailed, security
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The accident, occurring in the La Mesa zone, was attributed to
the bad state of the railroad, said Fire Department commander
Carlos Gopar in Tijuana City of that state, 2,126 kilometers
northwest of the Mexican capital.
</P>
<P>
The train, bound to Compania de Gas in Tijuana, was pulling
five tank wagons filled with butane gas that had been coupled to
it in the U.S. city of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
Firemen doused the five tank wagons with water to cool them as
they were exposed to intense sunlight, said Gopar.
</P>
<P>
Houses located within a radius of two blocks around the site
were evacuated, he said, adding that the derailment caused no
victims.
</P>
<P>
Municipal civil protection director Antonio Rosquillas said
that the zone of the accident was cordoned off and that the
discharge of the 33,000 liters of butane gas contained in the
wagons would take at least 12 hours.

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua, Costa Rica Resume Talks on Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Nicaragua and Costa Rica resumed
talks Wednesday to resolve a one-and-a-half-year-long border
dispute with the mediation of the Organization of American States
(OAS).
</P>
<P>
OAS General Secretary Cesar Gaviria, who arrived here Wednesday
afternoon, will attend the talks to be held at the Nicaraguan
Foreign Ministry building.
</P>
<P>
The OAS mediation was requested by the Costa Rican government
early this month after all its efforts failed to settle the
dispute over navigation limit on the San Juan River, a natural
border between Costa Rica and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
The dispute, which has soured relations between the two Latin
American countries, began in July 1998 when Managua barred the
navigation of Costa Rican armed policemen on the river.
</P>
<P>
The Canas-Jerez treaty signed between them in 1858 allowed
Nicaragua sovereignty over the river and Costa Rica the permanent
rights of free commercial navigation.

These achievements are due to the CPC Central Committee with
Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core grasping the overall situation and
exercising correct leadership. In 1999, we resolutely opposed the
barbaric US-led NATO bombing of our embassy in the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, dealt a powerful blow to the arrogance of
the Taiwan separatists represented by Lee Teng-hui, and took
decisive measures against the Falungong cult. The great victories
achieved in these struggles are of far-reaching political
significance and have created a positive social climate for our
economic development. In accordance with a decision of the CPC
Central Committee, Party and government leaders at or above the
county level were educated about the importance of study,
political awareness and upright conduct. This notably improved
their ideological standards and political awareness and ensured
smooth progress for reform, opening up and the socialist
modernization drive. In addition, the central authorities
maintained a correct understanding of the trends in economic
development so that at the critical moment when there was an
economic downturn in the second quarter of 1999, they were able to
resolutely make important policy decisions that stimulated
domestic demand by issuing more treasury bonds and increasing
personal incomes and to fully use macro-economic measures to
encourage investment, consumption and exports. All these played an
important role in promoting economic growth and improving economic
performance. Through our work and exploration over the past few
years, we have accumulated a wealth of experience in curbing
inflation, and now we have some basic experience in controlling
deflation as well.

These achievements are also due to the hard work of the people
throughout the country. In spite of many difficulties, the cadres
and the general public pressed forward with great confidence as
they conscientiously implemented the guiding principles and
policies of the central authorities, working hard and showing a
high degree of initiative. On behalf of the State Council, I would
now like to pay my highest respects to the people from all walks
of life, including workers, farmers, intellectuals, cadres and
members of the People's Liberation Army, the armed police and the
public security police. You have all been working hard on your
various fronts throughout the country. Our sincere thanks also go
to our compatriots in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,
the Macao Special Administrative Region and Taiwan as well as
overseas Chinese who have shown their concern and support for the
development and reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
We are fully aware that there are many difficulties and
problems in our path. A number of major problems still plague our
economic activities, including insufficient effective demand,
serious anomalies in the economic system, high unemployment and
slow growth in farmers' incomes. Lax management in many fields and
organizations results in poor efficiency, tremendous losses and
waste, and frequent occurrence of serious accidents. Certain
government functionaries are indifferent to the well-being of the
people. Bureaucracy, formalism, falsification and exaggeration are
rampant. Certain policies were not conscientiously implemented in
some grass-roots units. The emergence and spread of certain types
of corruption and undesirable practices have not been brought
under control. Public order in some areas is not good. We must
continue to take effective measures to solve these problems.

Fellow Deputies,
</P>
<P>
 The year 2000 marks the turn of the century, and it is the
last year for attaining the strategic objectives for the second
stage of China's socialist modernization drive. It is important
that the government do its work well this year to ensure a smooth
transition into the next century. Guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory
and the basic line of the CPC, and in accordance with the general
requirements of the CPC Central Committee for their work in the
year 2000, governments at all levels should implement the spirit
of the Fifteenth National Congress of the CPC and the third and
fourth plenary sessions of the Fifteenth CPC Central Committee.
They should also continue to carry out all the policies and
measures adopted by the Central Committee for promoting reform,
opening up and economic development; balance reform, development
and stability; work to maintain sustained, rapid and sound
development of the national economy; and conscientiously increase
efforts to advance socialist cultural and ethical progress and
improve democracy and the legal system in order to promote all-
round social progress and greet the new century with outstanding
achievements.

II. Adhering to the Policy of Expanding Domestic Demand
</P>
<P>
Development is the absolute principle and the key to solving
the problems we are facing. Only by sustaining rapid economic
growth on the basis of better performance can we mitigate the
operating problems facing enterprises, lighten unemployment
pressure, make structural adjustments possible and deepen reforms.
This is also essential in order to increase state revenue, prevent
financial risks and maintain social stability. To achieve all this,
we must unswervingly carry out a policy of expanding domestic
demand and other related macroeconomic policies.

<P>
We should continue to follow a pro-active fiscal policy. This
is the most direct and effective means for expanding domestic
demand at present. The central authorities have been following a
pro-active fiscal policy over the past two years, while at the
same time they have given full play to the role of monetary policy
and a variety of other means to regulate the operation of the
economy, constantly working to improve these policies and measures.
The government issued additional treasury bonds to banks to
increase investment and raised people's incomes to stimulate
consumption. It improved infrastructure and supported
technological upgrading in enterprises. In addition, great efforts
were made to expand domestic demand and encourage exports.
Experience has shown that following a pro-active fiscal policy was
the entirely correct thing to do because it was remarkably
successful. Take the effect of treasury bonds for example. Over
the past two years, the long-term bonds worth 210 billion yuan
issued by the government to banks provided the impetus for over
420 billion yuan in bank loans and funds raised by enterprises,
which were used to increase investment in infrastructure and
finance the construction of over 5,100 projects. Among the
completed projects are those which resulted in reinforcing nearly
6,100 km of dikes on major rivers and lakes, the opening of 12,000
km of newly built highways for traffic, including 3,358 km of
expressways, and the building of 1,423 km of new railway lines and
643 km of double-tracked railway lines. In addition, the
development of urban infrastructure and environmental protection
were significantly stepped up, leading to remarkable changes in
many cities. Efforts to upgrade technology in enterprises and
apply more high and new technology in production were accelerated.
We added 900,000 km of modern high- and low-voltage lines to rural
power grids through extension or upgrading of the existing lines.
State-owned grain depots with a total capacity of 25 billion kg
were built. All the above have not only contributed to current
economic growth, but they also have laid a better foundation for
long-term economic development.

This year the main content of our sustained pro-active fiscal
policy is as follows. First of all, long-term treasury bonds worth
100 billion yuan will be issued, and the resulting funds will be
invested mainly in water conservation, transportation and
communications and other infrastructure projects, science,
technology and education facilities, environmental improvement and
ecological conservation projects and technological upgrading in
enterprises, with more investment directed to the central and
western regions of the country. The funds raised from the
additional treasury bonds will be earmarked for projects under
construction so that they can be completed and go into operation
on schedule. We should work hard to raise the return on
investments and make sure that no projects without solid funding
or long drawn-out projects are launched. Control must be tightened
over project quality and inspection and audit supervision must be
strengthened to ensure that all projects are built well and that
no project funds are misappropriated. Second, we must continue to
carry out the policy measures introduced in 1999 for adjusting
income distribution to ensure steady growth in the incomes of
urban residents in the middle- and low-income range. Enterprises
should also appropriately increase employee salaries whenever
better economic performance is achieved. Government finance
departments at all levels should make adjustments in their pattern
of expenditures to ensure that the basic cost of living allowances
for workers laid off from state-owned enterprises, basic old-age
pensions for retirees, the subsistence allowances for urban
residents, and salaries of public servants are paid out in full
and on time. Third, we should make more use of means such as
taxation and pricing, and continue to revoke policies, laws and
statutes restricting consumption in order to encourage investment,
promote consumption and increase exports.

Over the past few years deficits and the national debt have
increased to some extent, but this is necessary to guarantee
reform, development and stability. Because the servicing of
treasury bonds is listed in this year's budget, the deficit is
somewhat larger than originally expected. Nevertheless, the
deficits and the issue of treasury bonds this year will roughly
stand at the previous year's levels and still be kept within
limits our national economy can sustain. So long as our economy
continues to grow rapidly and economic performance keeps improving
over a fairly long period, we will be able to repay the debt. At
the same time, we must take measures to guard against financial
risks. We should take better advantage of the role of monetary
policy. Financial institutions should balance their efforts to
support economic growth and prevent financial risks. In accordance
with the principle of prudent operation, they should adopt a
variety of measures to increase support for economic development.
The People's Bank of China should regulate total money supply as
necessary by using various tools of monetary policy. Financial
services should be substantially improved. In state banks,
internal capital allocation should be improved, and limits of
authority for examining and approving loans should be rationally
defined. We should promptly grant fixed asset loans to support
projects financed by the issue of treasury bonds. We should
guarantee floating capital loans for profitable and trustworthy
enterprises whose products are readily marketable. More loans
should be granted to small and medium-sized enterprises with
various types of ownership, especially enterprises based on
advances in science and technology. We should also make the
efforts necessary to solve the problem of farmers having
difficulty taking out loans. We should stop or reduce lending to
enterprises that are building redundant projects or have large
stocks of unsold products or whose production capacity needs to be
reduced. We should vigorously expand housing loans, student loans
and major commodity loans for consumers, and improve methods and
simplify procedures to increase the efficiency in processing loan
applications. We should further standardize and develop the
securities market so that enterprises will be able to increase the
proportion of direct financing. We should improve the system for
issuing and listing stocks on stock markets. We should also
support large state-owned enterprises and high and new technology
enterprises in their efforts to seek financing by listing on the
stock market. In order to expand the insurance industry we should
strictly examine and approve the establishment of insurance
enterprises in accordance with the law.

Reform measures should be made more transparent; the general
public's confidence in the future needs to be strengthened; and
more immediate consumption should be encouraged. Some major reform
measures closely related to the interests of the general public
have already gone into effect. In implementing them, all
localities should take into full consideration the general public'
s capacity to tolerate the changes and not shift costs formerly
borne by the government and society onto the general public. We
should foster new consumption growth areas such as housing and
make housing construction truly a major industry. Commercial
services in areas such as telecommunications, tourism, culture,
entertainment, health care and sports should be expanded.
Particular emphasis should be given to increasing the income of
farmers and expanding rural markets. Policies aimed at reducing
the burden on farmers must continue to be implemented strictly. We
must promote reform of taxes and charges in rural areas to
substantially lighten the burden on farmers. Experiments will be
carried out in Anhui Province this year so that the work can be
done in other parts of the country after the results of the
experiments are analyzed. Efforts to attain the goal set in the
seven-year plan to help 80 million people get out of poverty
should be intensified.

III. Working Energetically to Promote Strategic Restructuring
of the Economy
</P>
<P>
Acceleration of the strategic restructuring of the economy is
urgently needed to meet the current need to boost domestic demand
and stimulate economic growth. This economic restructuring is also
essential to adapt to changes in China's economic development as
it moves from one stage to another and to cope with increasingly
keen international competition. This restructuring is not only
aimed at solving current pressing problems; more importantly, it
is aimed at long-term development, improving the overall quality
of the national economy and bringing the economy to a higher level
of development. Adjustment and optimization of the economic
structure should be market-oriented, rely on scientific and
technological advances, and adopt new systems and methods
compatible with the development of a socialist market economy. Our
work this year will be focused on the following areas.

We should further stabilize and strengthen agriculture as the
foundation of the economy. Because of good harvests in the past
several years running and the relative surplus of farm produce, it
is particularly important that we guard against the tendency to
neglect agricultural development. China has entered a new stage of
agricultural development and strategic adjustment of agricultural
production is an important task at this stage. Farmers should be
actively encouraged to transform agricultural production by
developing livestock breeding, forestry, aquaculture and
production of highly processed grain and other agricultural
products. The varieties of crops cultivated and breeds of
livestock raised should be improved and great efforts should be
made to spread the use of applied agricultural scientific and
technological achievements so that high-quality products are
developed to meet the demand of the market. We should adjust the
patterns of agricultural production in different regions, taking
into account their relative abundance of resources and other local
relative advantages. We should develop high-efficiency, ecological
and export-oriented agriculture where conditions permit. In
restructuring agriculture, we should fully respect the farmer's
right to independence in production and operation, avoiding
coercion and commands. We should develop specialized cooperative
economic organizations and industrial operations in which farmers
work with companies, linking household farm operations with large
markets and bringing about agricultural restructuring. We should
provide guidance and support for town and township enterprises in
their efforts to restructure to meet the demand of the market and
improve their managerial and technical levels. Plans should be
worked out and effective policy measures should be taken to
accelerate the development of small towns. Arable land should be
effectively protected. We should step up agricultural
infrastructure development, focusing on water conservancy projects
to improve production and living conditions in rural areas.

We need to intensify industrial restructuring efforts. To
improve the industrial structure, product quality and economic
performance, and become more competitive internationally, we
should adopt the following measures. First, following the laws
governing the market economy, we should employ a variety of means
to limit the production of non-marketable products. More small and
technologically backward plants and mines that produce shoddy
products, waste resources and cause serious pollution should be
closed down. More outmoded equipment, technology and production
processes should be abandoned and the surplus production capacity
in certain industries should be reduced. Second, we should take
effective measures to speed up technological upgrading in
enterprises, giving preferences to old industrial bases. We should
continue to put quality above everything else, introduce advanced
standards and restructure and optimize the pattern of production.
Efforts to develop new technology, production processes and
products that are in great demand on the market need to be
intensified. Production of more readily marketable products,
especially famous, quality products, should be encouraged. Third,
vigorous efforts should be made to develop high technology and
emerging industries, particularly in the field of information,
bioengineering, new energy sources, new materials and
environmental protection. In addition, we should develop more
labor-intensive industries. Fourth, industrial reorganization
efforts should be continued to help key industries improve their
economy of scale and optimize their distribution. We should work
hard to upgrade the technology used in the major equipment
manufacturing and basic materials industries. The relevant
departments under the State Council should expeditiously work out
plans and adopt measures to stimulate industrial restructuring and
technological upgrading.

Developing tertiary industry is of great importance to our
efforts to optimize the economic structure, create jobs and
increase consumption. While continuing to develop transport,
commerce and trade, we need to make great efforts to develop
information, banking and financial services, tourism, community
services and intermediary services to gradually raise the
proportion of tertiary industry in the national economy.

The large-scale development strategy to speed up development of
the central and western regions of the country is a major policy
decision made by the CPC Central Committee for the new century in
accordance with Deng Xiaoping's strategy for China's modernization
drive, which encompasses the development of both the coastal areas
and the interior. This is crucial to our efforts to boost domestic
demand, promote sustained national economic growth and bring about
coordinated development of regional economies for eventual common
prosperity as well as to strengthen national unity, safeguard
social stability and consolidate border defense. Implementing this
great policy decision is a long-term systems engineering project.
We need not only a sense of urgency, but also a comprehensive plan
focusing on key areas. We must carry out the plan step by step and
refrain from rushing headlong into action.

For the present and some time to come, we have to focus on the
following objectives. First, we need to accelerate infrastructure
development. While mainly concentrating on highways, efforts
should also be made to build more railways, airports and gas trunk
pipelines. We need to intensify the development of power grids and
communications, radio and television facilities as well as
infrastructure development in large and medium-sized cities. It is
particularly important that close attention is paid to the
rational exploitation of water resources and to water conservation.
We should lose no time in conducting feasibility studies for
certain key projects and make preparations to launch them as soon
as possible. Second, we need to conserve and improve the
ecological environment. Great efforts should be made to plant
trees and grass, control soil erosion and prevent and control
desertification. Greater efforts need to be made to complete the
projects to protect the natural forests along the upper reaches of
the Yangtze River and the upper and middle reaches of the Yellow
River. Terraced fields on steep slopes should be returned to
forests or pastures in a planned and systematic way. In light of
our relatively ample supply of grain and other farm produce,
forests and pastures should be developed at the expense of grain
production in accordance with the comprehensive measures for
returning cultivated land to forests or pastures, closing off
hillsides to facilitate afforestation, giving relief to local
residents in the form of grain, and encouraging individual
contractors to manage concerned areas, so as to exchange grain for
forests and pastures. We need to work out plans and provide
effective policy guidance for this work, respect the wishes of
farmers and carry out experiments, gradually spreading successful
new practices. Any further effort to clear forests and pastures to
reclaim land should be resolutely stopped. Third, in light of
local geography, climate, resources and other conditions,
different regions should focus on developing strong industries
with local characteristics as well as high and new technology
industries where conditions permit. Fourth, science, technology
and education should be vigorously developed. The translation of
scientific and technological advances into productive forces
should be accelerated; people should be trained in different
fields at different levels of expertise; and the overall quality
of the workforce should be improved. Fifth, we should open China
wider to the outside world, improve the investment environment and
do all we can to attract overseas funds and import foreign
technology and managerial expertise.

<P>
The eastern region should continue to take advantage of its
strong points to constantly improve the performance of the local
economy and its competitiveness so as to facilitate its own
development. Areas where conditions permit should take the lead in
modernizing and continue to give more support to the central and
western regions in various ways, such as joint development,
cooperation for mutual benefit, providing coordinated assistance
and exchange of cadres. The central and western regions must seize
opportunities and quicken the pace of reform and opening up. They
should rely on their own hard work to develop themselves, stress
practical results and work in a down-to-earth manner to succeed in
all fields of endeavor.

IV. Continuing to Advance Reforms and Bringing About Comprehensive
Improvement in Management
</P>
<P>
To meet the objective set by the CPC Central Committee to
establish and improve a socialist market economy, we should
continue to implement reforms which provide a powerful driving
force for pushing forward structural adjustment, improving
economic performance and bringing about sustained, rapid and sound
development of the national economy.

Reform of state-owned enterprises is a key link in our efforts
to deepen economic restructuring. The top priority for this year's
government work is to implement the decision made at the Fourth
Plenary Session of the Fifteenth CPC Central Committee in
September 1999 to attain the goal set for a three-year period,
that is, to turn around most of the large and medium-sized state-
owned enterprises operating at a loss and implement a preliminary
modern enterprise system in most key large and medium-sized state-
owned enterprises. No time should be lost in setting standards for
a modern enterprise system suited to China's conditions, which all
enterprises should follow. The enterprise management system should
be reformed; the way enterprises are operated should be changed;
and corporate management structure should be optimized. Inspection
and supervision over large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises should be improved, and the board of supervisors
system should be gradually consolidated and standardized. Boards
of supervisors should be assigned to state-owned enterprises
according to law to examine the financial dealings of enterprises,
exercise supervision over the members of the boards of directors
and managers performing their duties, and safeguard the rights and
interests of the owners of state assets. The senior managerial
staffs in key state-owned enterprises need to be strengthened. The
way enterprise groups manage their subsidiary companies needs to
be further improved to make the system of a parent company and its
subsidiaries meet the standards of a modern enterprise system.
Restructuring of the labor, personnel and income distribution
systems of enterprises needs to be deepened to establish incentive
and restraint mechanisms. A number of enterprises with good
economic performance should experiment with the annual salary
system, stock options and other methods of income distribution for
managers and factory directors. Measures for increasing the amount
of capital reserves available to write off non-performing loans
and bad debts in banks, carrying out debt-to-equity swap programs
in enterprises where conditions permit, and increasing the
proportion of capital raised by enterprises through direct
financing should be carefully implemented. The asset-liability
ratios of state-owned enterprises should be improved to help firms
operating at a loss get out of the red. Strategic restructuring of
the state sector of the economy should proceed steadily. Ways of
effectively instituting multiple forms of public ownership should
be vigorously explored. Large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises to which the stockholding system is applicable should
make use of the stock market and quickly implement stockholding
system reforms. In addition to striving to develop those large
enterprise groups that are internationally competitive, we should
also realistically work to relax control over small and medium-
sized state-owned enterprises in a variety of ways. The
establishment of a service system for medium-sized and small
enterprises should be accelerated. While keeping the public sector
of the economy in the dominant position, sound development of the
non-public sector, including self-employed and private businesses,
should be encouraged.

The 47-year-old single mother asked Australians to donate to
rescue her from debts of more than 610,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The party was convicted last week of fraud over the
registration in the Queensland state with a false report on its
membership figure. The party then received an election funding of
more than 300,000 U.S. dollars from the state's Electoral
Commission which sought to take the money back after the judgment
pronouncement by the state's Court of Appeal.
</P>
<P>
"If I don't come up with the money and the court costs that
have been awarded against me, it could mean I won't be standing
for parliament again," she said.
</P>
<P>
The party is widely believed in Australia to be a racialist one.
</P>

Hanson strongly opposes Asian immigrants, accusing them of
grabbing Australians' employment chances. She had claimed that
China and Indonesia were attempting to colonize Australia. On the
domestic affairs, Hanson insists on a harsh attitude towards the
Aboriginals.
</P>
<P>
One Nation party won a bright victory of the 1998 Queensland
election and 11 of is candidates were voted into the state
parliament. Ironically, Hanson herself lost her seat in the
federal Senate in a later general election. So, she appears at the
federal Parliament now as an adviser to her party's senator.

BEIJING, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Following is the full text of
Premier Zhu Rongji's government work report he delivered at the
Third Session of the Ninth National People's Congress.

Fellow Deputies,
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the State Council, I now submit a report on the
work of the government for your examination and approval and also
for comments from members of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
 I. Review of Domestic Work in 1999
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the
people of all ethnic groups worked hard in 1999 to promote reform,
opening up and modernization, making new advances in all fields of
endeavor.
</P>
<P>
The quality of national economic development improved. The
objective for the growth rate of the gross domestic product was
attained; there were structural adjustments in the economy; and
economic performance improved noticeably. There was a good harvest,
and preliminary improvements were achieved in the pattern of
farming. Industrial production continued to grow while structural
adjustments were being made. Some outmoded production capacity was
eliminated; production of unmarketable goods decreased; and the
sales rate of products rose steadily. Profits from industrial
enterprises totaled 220.2 billion yuan in 1999, representing an
increase of 52% over the previous year. Total profits from state-
owned enterprises and enterprises with controlling share held by
the state reached 96.7 billion yuan, an increase of 77.7% over the
previous year, a record high for the past five years. The economic
performance of most industries was noticeably improved. Industrial
performance was better than the previous year in 27 provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central
government. National revenue was 150.1 billion yuan more than the
1998 figure. Total national revenue reached 1.1377 trillion yuan,
exceeding one trillion yuan for the first time. There was
stability in banking and financial operations, and money supply
and total credit continued to increase. The volume of exports
began to rise considerably in July, and total exports reached US$
194.9 billion in 1999, a rise of 6.1% over the previous year. The
use of direct foreign investment continued on a relatively large
scale, but decreased slightly over the previous year. The exchange
rates for the Renminbi remained stable. Foreign exchange reserves
totaled US$154.7 billion at the end of 1999. The national economy
continued to develop in a satisfactory manner.

<P>
Major progress was made in reforming state-owned enterprises
and turning around loss-generating operations. We accelerated the
separation of government functions from enterprise management. We
have basically accomplished the objective of cutting all business
ties between the Party and central government organs on the one
hand and the economic entities set up by these bodies and
enterprises directly under their jurisdiction on the other. The
army, the armed police, and the procuratorial, judicial and public
security organs are no longer engaged in business activities. The
reorganization of key state-owned enterprises progressed,
resulting in the formation of a number of large enterprise groups.
Efforts to effect internal reforms in enterprises and changes in
the way they operate were strengthened. Through merger, bankruptcy,
reorganization, association, debt-to-equity swap, improved
management and other measures, the number of large and medium-
sized loss-generating state-owned industrial enterprises and loss-
generating enterprises with controlling share held by the state
decreased significantly. The objective of turning around the
economic performance of state-owned enterprises within three years
has been attained one year ahead of schedule in the textile
industry. Profits were increased or losses reduced encouragingly
in other industries. Significant progress was made in efforts to
reform state-owned enterprises and turn around their operation in
the three provinces in northeast China and other old industrial
bases, with significant reduction of losses and increase of
profits. These achievements encouraged the cadres and the masses
to continue working to overcome difficulties and demonstrated that
the objectives set by the central authorities for reforming state-
owned enterprises and turning around operations within three years
are attainable.

 Science, technology, education and other social undertakings
developed in an all-round way. Technological innovation and
translation of scientific and technological advances into
practical productive forces were accelerated. Basic scientific and
high-tech research were strengthened. The reform of the management
system for science and technology was deepened. Major progress was
made in efforts to make nine-year compulsory education universal
in the country and to eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-
aged people. Regular university and college enrollment increased
by 47.4% over the previous year, the biggest increase in years.
Continued progress was made gradually in the reform of education
and in the work of improving the overall quality of students.
Notable advances were made in environmental protection and
ecological conservation. Social sciences continued to develop. New
levels of achievements were reached in literature and art, the
press and publishing, radio, film and television, family planning,
public health, sports and other related fields. Efforts to ground
cultural and ethical values on socialist principles and to improve
democracy and the legal system were reinforced. Fresh progress was
made in efforts to promote democracy at the grass-roots level. A
wide-reaching and powerful drive to combat all forms of criminal
activity was carried out, bringing about improvement in all facets
of public security and increasing social stability. Fresh steps
were taken in efforts to build a clean and honest government and
in the struggle against corruption. Modernization of national
defense was accelerated.

The living standards of both urban and rural residents
continued to improve. The government increased the incomes of
urban dwellers with low and medium level incomes on July 1 of last
year. The level of the basic cost of living allowances for laid-
off state enterprise workers, the level of unemployment insurance
benefits, and the level of subsistence allowances for urban
residents were all increased by 30%. The salaries and wages of
employees working in government departments and institutions and
old-age pensions for those retired from there were increased along
with the old-age pensions for workers retired from state-owned
enterprises. All back pension entitlements were paid for workers
retired from state-owned enterprises covered by the overall state
plan. Certain allowances for disabled service men and women and
family members of revolutionary martyrs and service men and women
were increased. Total budgetary expenditures were increased by
more than 54 billion yuan to cover these items, which benefited
over 84 million people across the country. The per capita
disposable income of urban residents rose by 9.3% over the
previous year in real terms after adjusting for price decreases.
The per capita net income of rural dwellers increased by 3.8% in
real terms, and the population below the poverty line decreased by
8 million. The number of legal holidays was increased. This
stimulated consumption and improved the quality of people's life.
</P>
<P>
Last year we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the founding of
new China with great fanfare and smoothly secured the return of
Macao to the motherland. These two great events immensely
stimulated the ardent zeal of the people all over the country to
work to rejuvenate China and strengthened the cohesion of our
nation.

The spilling over of the Angolan civil war into neighboring

"War in one country constitutes a problem; if it spills over to

The Namibian government has allowed the Angolan government
troops to use its territory to launch attacks on the National

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Supreme Court Denies Report on Sharia Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Supreme Court Wednesday
denied that Chief Justice Muhammadu Uwais had advised President
Olusegun Obasanjo on the constitutionality of the introduction of
Islamic Sharia law in some states of the country.
</P>
<P>
In reference to a recent newspaper report which claimed that
Obasanjo once sought the advice of Uwais on the Sharia issue, the
court's registrar Malam Dodo said that ''the Chief Justice of
Nigeria categorically denies that any such letter (of inquiry) was
sent to him by the president."
</P>
<P>
''He also emphatically denies that he replied such a letter
justifying the introduction of Sharia." Dodo said in a statement
published in Abuja, the capital of the most populous African
country.
</P>
<P>
A lagos-based newspaper last week alleged that Obasanjo had
sent a note to Uwais to seek his view on the constitutionality of
Sharia.
</P>
<P>
The publication also alleged that Uwais wrote the president
''an elaborate reply which, in essence, justified the
introduction of Sharia.''
</P>
<P>
Riots over the introduction of Sharia had killed some 1,000
people in Nigeria's northern State of Kaduna and the southeast
states of Abia and Imo last month.
</P>
<P>
The supporters of Sharia, most of them Moslems, had repeatedly
claimed that they introduce the Islamic law according to clauses
in the constitution, while the opponents thought just the
opposite.

<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian police rounded up three
Hamas militants with a lot of explosives in a West Bank village
Thursday on the eve of the scheduled renewal of Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks in Washington .
</P>
<P>
The Hamas men surrendered to the police after they were
surrounded at Qallil, near the town of Nablus, said a Palestinian
security officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The police had been tipped off to the militants' location by
Israel's internal security service, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, another report quoted neighbors who heard police
negotiating with the men during the three-hour standoff as saying
that one of the suspected guerrillas had been captured beforehand
and he had led the security forces to the explosive-filled hideout.
</P>
<P>
The neighbors said two of the men were from the Gaza Strip
and told the landlord they were students.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian security officer said at least two of the
arrested apparently belonged to a Hamas squad on the run since an
Israeli
raid on a house rented by the guerrillas in an Arab town in
northern
Israel two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Israel said Hamas had planned to carry out a large-scale
bombings in Israeli cities.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has been strongly against the Israeli-Palestinian peace
deals and has killed dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings, mainly
in 1996 before Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat launched a
crackdown against the organization.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warns India, Pakistan of Dangerous Future with Nuclear Arms Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Thursday that he will tell Indian and Pakistani leaders
during his stay in South Asia that their nuclear arms race could
only bring in a "dangerous future."
</P>
<P>
"India and Pakistan have legitimate security concerns. But I
will make clear our view that a nuclear future is a dangerous
future for them and for the world," Clinton said in videotaped
remarks to the Carnegie Nonproliferation Conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
India first set off nuclear tests in May 1998, and Pakistan
followed suit by a tit-for-tat action. The tests stunned the world
and plunged the subcontinent into high tension.
</P>
<P>
"There are those in the region who hope we will simply accept
its nuclear status and move on. I will not do that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will take a week-long trip to South Asia, starting
Saturday. He will visit India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. And he
made it clear that differences should be narrowed on
nonproliferation between the United States and India and Pakistan
before broader relationship could be made.
</P>
<P>
"I'll stress that narrowing our differences on nonproliferation
is important to moving toward a broader relationship," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who is accompanying
Clinton on the trip, said Tuesday that progress on controlling
India's nuclear weapons was essential "before India and the United
States can realize fully the vast potential of our relationship."

<HEADLINE> Nicaragua, Costa Rica Suspend Dialogue on San Juan River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan Foreign Minister
Eduardo Montealegre and his Costa Rican counterpart Roberto Rojas
have suspended a meeting on the navigation rights in the San Juan
border River, an official source said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry spokesman Cesar Ubeda told Xinhua
that the meeting, that should have continued Thursday, was
suspended Wednesday night without any accord being made, since
both sides maintain their respective positions.
</P>
<P>
Ubeda said that the two foreign ministers have planned to meet
next April in San Jose, Costa Rica, to continue the talks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was resumed Wednesday with the presence of
Organization of American States (OAS) general secretary Cesar
Gaviria, as facilitator of the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The conflict between Costa Rica and Nicaragua emerged in July
of 1998 when Nicaragua barred the transit of Costa Rican armed
guards along the San Juan River.
</P>
<P>
The Canas-Jerez treaty signed between the two countries in 1858
allowed Nicaragua sovereignty over the river and Costa Rica the
permanent rights of free commercial navigation.

<HEADLINE> EU Regrets U.S. Complaint of Noise Reduction Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission Thursday
expressed its regret over the United States' decision to file a
complaint with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, said that the filing of Article 84 action threatens the
efforts it has made to try and find a reasonable solution to the
current opposition between the EU and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Loyola de Palacio, commission vice-president in charge of
transport and energy, said that the U.S. decision would make it
harder to find an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The European Union will ban from 2002 all non-EU aircraft
fitted with a noise-reducing device of engine muffler or hushkit
and the EU law will be in force on May 4 this year.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc decided to limit the use of older aircraft
that use engine mufflers. EU officials said that while reducing
noise pollution, the mufflers were not effective at controlling
air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Europeans also believed that the mufflers cannot reduce
noise sufficiently and merely prolong the life of old-type
aircraft that should have been taken out of service altogether.
</P>
<P>
The United States insisted that the EU withdraw the noise
muffler law or suspend it while the European Union argued that it
would suspend the law on guarantees that the United States was
serious about agreeing to new international noise pollution
standards.
</P>
<P>
The United States took the EU law on hushkit as discriminating
against American airlines that re-sell aircraft with mufflers in
Europe and against hushkit makers that are all based in the United
States.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Not Aware of Imminent Resumption of Syrian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States said
Thursday that it was not aware of imminent resumption of peace
talks between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of any imminent announcement (of the resumption)
... I tend to be aware of such imminent announcements," said State
Department spokesman James Rubin at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to remarks by Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa
Tlas, who said in Lebanon earlier Thursday, "Bill Clinton will
succeed within weeks in restarting peace negotiations between
Syria and Lebanon and Israel."
</P>
<P>
Syria-Israeli talks broke off in January in disagreement over
whether Israel should commit itself in advance to full withdrawal
from the Golan Heights. Israel wants to start talks by discussing
security and other elements of a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States was in regular touch with both
sides in an attempt to get them back at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to clarify positions to see if we can get to a
point where there is enough confidence on each side that it can
meet its needs if negotiations are resumed and that the
negotiations will lead to some place," he said.
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on speculation that President Clinton
could meet Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in Geneva, also within
weeks.
</P>
<P>
"With respect to a meeting between the president and President
Assad, I'm not going to go into what we may or may not do, other
than to say that we've always made it clear that we will do what
we think is appropriate to advance the prospects for peace between
Israel and Syria," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Court Trial for Dutroux Soon to Begin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Court trial for Belgium's
notorious child abuser and killer Marc Dutroux has been scheduled
to begin next Monday, almost two years after his attempted escape.
</P>
<P>
The trial of Dutroux who was accused of raping and killing four
little girls in 1996 had to be postponed after Dutroux broke loose
from guarding gendarmerie on April 23, 1998, and ran free for
three and a half hours before being caught again by a forest
police.
</P>
<P>
A total of 5,000 policemen and women from Belgium, France and
Luxembourg joined the man-hunt for the pedophile. The escape
attempt alone can earn Dutroux a jail term of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian justice and interior ministers had to resign
following the incident of Dutroux' escape.
</P>
<P>
Dutroux had been sentenced to 13 years in jail in 1989 for
raping five little girls but was released earlier than the jail
term. He was arrested in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
Two little girls were found to be still alive from the basement
of his house at the time of his arrest while four others were
found dead.
</P>
<P>
The exposure of Dutroux' crimes against little girls created a
furore in Belgium. Some 350,000 people hit the street of the
capital of Brussels to protest against the inefficiency of the
country's police and justice system.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Troops to Join NATO Exercise in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The exercise would be conducted when Kosovo was in a tense
situation as the Serbs clashed with the peacekeepers. Earlier this
year, clashes also arose between the Kosovar Albanians and the
French forces.
</P>
<P>
However, Pentagon spokesman P.J. Crowley told a regular
briefing that the U.S. participation in the exercise was not
linked to the situation in the Yugoslav province. It had been
planned in September last year, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Most of these forces will be staging out of Macedonia and then
the vast majority will move into various sectors and conduct their
field training in Kosovo itself," Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, which will also be attended by Argentina, the
Netherlands, Poland and Romania, coincides with the intense
tensions in the region.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that there was concern in the Balkans every
spring that the thaw of winter would be accompanied by renewed
violence.
</P>
<P>
"We are approaching spring in the Balkans and certainly this
should be an unmistakable signal to all parties in the region that
we will in an even-handed way continue to make clear to them that
all kinds of violence or return to the conflict of ethnic hatred
will not be tolerated," said Crowley.
</P>
<P>
Last spring, the U.S.-led NATO bombed Yugoslavia last spring
and hundreds of people were killed, houses were destroyed, and
people were forced to flee their homes. A multinational force was
deployed in Kosovo after the 78-day barbarous bombing.

<HEADLINE> ECB Raises Lending Rate Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Central Bank (ECB)
raised on Thursday its benchmark lending rate by another quarter
of a percentage point to 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The raise was the second within a month and a half and the
fourth since the single currency euro was launched on January 1,
1999. The rate was first raised on April 1999 to 2.5 percent,
before it being raised to 3.0 percent in November 1999 and then
again to 3.25 percent on February 3 this year.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark lending rate was first set at 3.0 percent on
January 1, 1999 but soon dropped down.
</P>
<P>
The raise of the lending rate was seen here as helping to ease
somewhat the pressure now on the single currency that kept
depreciating against the United States dollars.
</P>
<P>
The euro has suffered a decline against the dollar of more 18
percent since its inauguration when a euro traded 1.18 dollars.
Now it traded around 94 cents.
</P>
<P>
The European Union finance ministers met twice in their regular
council meetings in February and in March without working out any
measures to stabilize the euro.
</P>
<P>
They believed that the euro has the potential to appreciate
against the dollar thanks to a robust economy in both the 11-
nation euro zone and the 15-nation European Union.

<HEADLINE> Three Men Indicted in School Shooting Case in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three men, Jamelle James, Robert Morris and Sir Winfrey,
were charged with possessing stolen firearms and being unlawful
users of marijuana in possession of firearms, U.S. Attorney Saul
Green said.
</P>
<P>
Winfrey is the uncle of the 6-year-old boy who fatally shot
fellow first-grader Kayla Rolland on February 29 in a classroom in
Buell Elementary School in Mount Morris Township of Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
James, a friend of the boy's family, had earlier been charged
with involuntary manslaughter in Kayla's death. Authorities allege
he gave the boy access to the handgun used in the shooting, a
stolen .32-caliber semiautomatic.
</P>
<P>
Morris sold the stolen pistol last December that eventually
wound up in James' and Winfrey's possession.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors said investigators believe the gun had been left
under James' blankets at the house where the boy was staying with
his uncle.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the boy told them he took the gun to school to
scare Kayla, with whom he had apparently quarreled, but ended up
killing her with one shot. Prosecutors have said they will not
charge the boy, whose name was not released, because he is too
young to understand his actions.
</P>
<P>
Each charge carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and
a 250,000-U.S.-dollar fine.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Presidential Candidate Challenges to Chavez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Presidential candidate Francisco
Arias said on Thursday he is sure of defeating Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez on May 28 of this year elections.
</P>
<P>
Arias, a former military officer, who resigned two days ago as
governor of the oil-rich Zulia state, registered Wednesday his
presidential candidacy.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to win the elections and we will win them in an
overwhelming way," said Arias, adding that his participation with
Chavez in the coup attempt of February 4 of 1992 "belongs to the
past."
</P>
<P>
A former state governor who joined Chavez in leading a failed
coup attempt in 1992, Arias has also attacked the year-old
government for souring ties with Cuba and driving the oil-reliant
economy deeper into recession.
</P>
<P>
The candidate said that his differences with Chaves are
substantial in what concerns to what a government must be.
</P>
<P>
Chavez, who enjoyed popularity ratings of more than 70 percent,
had been expected to comfortably win the presidential vote and
gain majority control of the National Assembly and regional
governments.

 ATHENS, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos said Thursday that what was necessary was the
undertaking of initiatives for peace in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo, with the inflow of investments and the reconsideration of
the embargo against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki,
Tsohatzopoulos said that only concern from the international

what was necessary were initiatives of substantive and decisive
support for the implementation of the U.N. Security Council's
resolution.

<P>
He confirmed that the Council of Defense and Foreign Affairs
Ministers would meet in Brussels next Monday with the main target
of which would be restoring calm in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Sets up National HIV/AIDS Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government launched a
national HIV/AIDS council here on Thursday aiming to adopt a
multi-sectoral response to HIV/AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
The National HIV/AIDS/STD(sexually transmitted diseases)/TB
(tuberculosis) Council and Secretariat will advocate effective
multi-sector approaches towards the prevention of HIV
transmission, care and social support as well as impact mitigation
for those infected and affected by HIV/ AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The council will comprise 15 members appointed by the health
minister and the term of office will be two years with possibility
for re- appointment, said Information and Broadcasting Services
Minister Newstead Zimba at the launching ceremony.
</P>
<P>
According to Zimba, the organization will not be an
implementing agency, but will play a facilitative and catalystic
role in the implementation of the new national HIV/AIDS strategic
framework 2000-2002.
</P>
<P>
Since the first case of AIDS was found in Zambia in 1985, HIV
has become endemic with an estimated adult prevalence rate of
10-15 percent in rural areas and 25-30 percent in urban areas,
Zimba said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia is in the throes of a serious HIV/AIDS epidemic,
with the current number of children orphaned by the deadly disease
estimated to be 600,000, but projected to reach one million by
2002.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's health expenditure on HIV/AIDS will
increase from the estimated 3.4 million U.S. dollars in 1989 to
18.3 million U.S. dollars in 2004, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to enhance coordination of the national response to
the HIV/ AIDS epidemic, the government has been engaged in an
extensive consultative process to examine ways to establish an
institutional framework through which collaboration and
coordination could be achieved.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges African Countries to Curb Illicit Weapon Acquisition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has urged
countries in the Great Lakes region and the Horn of Africa to take
measures to curb illicit weapon acquisition, according to the
country's Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete.
</P>
<P>
To this end, those countries should focus on the resolution to
the underlying cause of the regional conflicts, said Kikwete when
addressing the Great Lakes region and the Horn of Africa
Conference on the proliferation of small arms, which was held in
Nairobi from March 12 to 15.
</P>
<P>
The resolution of the scourge of small arms must be based on a
combination of political, security and social measures at
national, regional and international levels, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said political settlement in Burundi, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), Somalia and the Sudan must be
intensified if the region has to be relieved of this menace.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Kikwete said, the sources of these weapons
like the manufacturers, merchants, banks and transporters must be
tackled.
</P>
<P>
The source countries can assist in a very big way in the spirit
of international partnership by restricting illicit trade and
trafficking of small arms and light weapons.
</P>
<P>
"This is the best way for curbing the problem," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete also urged countries in the region to improve
cooperation in date, information and intelligence exchange as well
as more stringent border controls and licensing.
</P>
<P>
Small arms and light weapons are considered by the foreign
minister as the major means that sustain the ongoing conflicts in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Small arms also fueled national and transnational criminal
activities. Armed banditry and associated murders, cattle thefts,
car hijacking and drug trafficking in the region are very much
facilitated and sustained by illicit weapons.

SADC will support the requests of Botswana, Namibia, South
Africa and Zimbabwe to sell their legal ivory stocks, the
14-nation bloc said in a statement.

"Sales will not encourage poaching," the statement said. "In
fact, we need more revenue from the sales to put up management
structures for the elephants."
</P>
<P>
The four SADC countries will formally make the request at the
11th conference of CITES to be held in Nairobi, Kenya from April
10 to 20.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dow Roars Nearly 500 While Nasdaq Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 16 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
roared nearly 500 points Thursday as investors rushed into the
blue chip stocks for bargain-hunting.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the industrials rose 499.19 or 4.9
percent at 10,630.60, extending its big gain of 320.17 points
Wednesday. The total gains in the past two trading days recovered
42 percent of the Dow's losses suffered since the index hit a
record closing high of 11,722.98 points on January 14.
</P>
<P>
Many of the blue chips that have been beaten down in recent
weeks enticed investors as relative bargains. Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
3M and General Electric all rose.
</P>
<P>
Financial service companies such as American Express and J.P.
Morgan also soared.
</P>
<P>
The strong performance in the industrial sector lifted the
technology heavy Nasdaq composite index out of the recent steep
falling. The Nasdaq index rose 134.77 at 4,717.39 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The composite lost 466.00 points in the previous three days
after it peaked at 5,048.62 points last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied despite the mixed news on inflation. The
Labor Department said wholesale prices surged 1 percent in
February, the largest gain in nearly 10 years but the "cord " rate
of inflation, which excluded the volatile energy and food
categories, matched expectations with a 0.3 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 29.42 at 634.44 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 21.53 at 1,017.65. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 15.36 at 574.24.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,442 up, 680 down and 383
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.48 billion shares from 1.30 billion
in the previous session, according to preliminary calculations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plays Down N. Ireland Talks in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told a regular briefing that
President Bill Clinton will take the opportunity to meet with the
leaders who are in Washington "in addition to the traditional
shamrock event" on St. Patrick's Day which falls on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I'd say that this is more than just courtesy, but I also don't
anticipate any breakthrough. There are discussions scheduled for
when they return home, and they will continue to try to find a way
through to implementing the Good Friday accords," Lockhart added.
</P>
<P>
The Good Friday accords was signed by the parties involved in
the future of the British province of Northern Ireland in 1998.
The peace process runs into an impasse after the Irish Republic
Army (IRA) refused to disarm and Britain suspended the self-rule
in the province.
</P>
<P>
Major players in the Northern Irish peace process, including
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams, British Secretary of State for
Northern Ireland Peter Mandelson, Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern and pro-Britain Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, are
gathering here.

<HEADLINE> Italy Protests Vegetable Fats Slipping Into Chocolate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Italy was flooded with protests
Thursday against the European parliament's decision to allow a
maximum of 5 percent vegetable-fat additives to be used in place
of cocoa butter in chocolate production.
</P>
<P>
The directive, approved Wednesday, authorizes the use of other
vegetable fats which are cheaper than cocoa butter, such as palm
oil, and lays down only that these additives should be contained
in the list of ingredients.
</P>
<P>
Some seventy businesses involved in making high-quality
chocolates staged a protest in Turin, insisting that they would
continue making their chocolate as before and accusing Europe of
giving in to pressure from multinationals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the Greens party, who are in the governing center-
left coalition, vowed to continue battling against the law.
</P>
<P>
Greens parliament member Paolo Cento said that "food safety and
quality are at risk of being sacrificed because of multinational
interests."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the probable result of a fall in demand for cocoa
butter, Cento said that "the economies of African and South
American countries, which are the principle producers of cocoa
butter, are being deprived and robbed."
</P>
<P>
Cento encouraged the chocolate industry to mobilize together in
defense of "real chocolate" on March 21.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Communist Re-foundation Party (PRC) distributed
high-quality chocolates Thursday in front of the Italian
parliament building to protest the measure.
</P>
<P>
The free sweets were meant to encourage the Italian government
to immediately "distance itself" from the decision in order to
protect consumers, high-quality food products, and workers in both
the Italian chocolate industry and the cocoa butter industries in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
European industrialists, on the other hand, are savoring the
decision to allow vegetable fats to slip into chocolate.
</P>
<P>
"This decision creates a single market for chocolate in the EU
and guarantees more choices for European consumers," said a note
issued by Caobisco, an organization which represents over 3,000
chocolate makers ranging from multinationals to small producers of
the sweet.
</P>
<P>
The chocolate issue has split the EU since 1973, when Britain,
Ireland and Denmark won an exemption from the European law saying
only cocoa butter could be used. Portugal, Finland, Austria and
Sweden were later awarded the same exemption status, to the anger
of purists led by Belgium and France.
