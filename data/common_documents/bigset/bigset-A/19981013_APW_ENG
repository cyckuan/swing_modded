Prosecutors, police search offices of failed Mita Industrial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese authorities on Tuesday raided the offices
of Mita Industrial Co., a failed maker of copy machines, on
suspicion it illegally paid dividends to shareholders to hide its
financial difficulties, a police official said.
	   A police official in the city of Osaka, speaking on condition of
anonymity, confirmed that a joint raid was conducted by police and
prosecutors but refused to provide other details.
	   Japanese news media said authorities were searching more than 10
locations, including Mita's head office in Osaka and the homes of
former company executives.
	   Mita is suspected of violating the commercial code by having
paid out some 37 billion yen (dlrs 316 million) in dividends over
the last 10 years to hide from shareholders that it was in the red,
news reports said.
	   With Japan's five-year statute of limitations, only about a
third of that sum could actually be cited in any charges filed.
	   Prosecutors are also considering breach of trust charges against
former Mita executives who received allowances totaling 272 billion
yen (dlrs 2.32 million) over the period, Kyodo News said.
	   Mita collapsed in August with about 200 billion yen (dlrs 1.7
billion) in liabilities in one of the largest failures in Japan
since World War II.
	   Mita, which has filed with the Osaka District Court to
restructure under Japan's corporate rehabilitation law, had seen
earnings sharply hit by the weakening yen in recent years.
	   Debt also pilled up as the company failed to trim its workforce
of 3,600 despite falling sales, company officials have said.
	   Shareholders of Mita Industrial, an unlisted company, were made
up mostly of its affiliate firms and the executives' relatives, the
reports said.

Braves 7, Padres 6
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with quotes, color. No pick up &QL; 
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Michael Tucker and the Atlanta Braves did what
they had to do to stay alive in the NL championship series, staging
a stunning comeback against no less than Kevin Brown.
	   With the Padres just five outs away from reaching the World
Series for the first time in 14 years, manager Bruce Bochy's
strategy to bring on Braves-killer Brown blew up when Tucker hit a
go-ahead, three-run homer that sent Atlanta to a 7-6 win Monday
night in Game 5.
	   Bochy's move looked good in the seventh, when Brown came on with
a 4-2 lead, a runner on and no outs and retired the side. But now,
after Brown faltered in just the third relief appearance of his
career, the strategy will be heavily questioned.
	   Tucker's homer highlighted a five-run rally in the eighth that
made it 7-4. Tucker drove in Atlanta's first five runs.
	   ``It's a tough one, no question about it,'' Bochy said. ``We
said before the game if we had a two-run lead, we'd use Brownie. He
had three days' rest.
	   ``We had our best out there, but it didn't work out. Now we just
have to go back to Atlanta,'' he said.
	   Pinch-hitter Greg Myers hit a two-run homer in the ninth off
Braves reliever Kerry Ligtenberg, and then Atlanta manager Bobby
Cox made his own unusual move _ bringing in four-time Cy Young
winner Greg Maddux from the bullpen.
	   Maddux, who had not relieved since 1987, got three outs for the
first save of his pro career.
	   Maddux struck out pinch-hitter Greg Vaughn, playing for the
first time since straining his left quadriceps in Game 1, and
retired Quilvio Veras on a grounder. After Steve Finley drew a rare
walk from Maddux, the Atlanta ace got Tony Gwynn on a game-ending
grounder.
	   Brown, who had been 6-0 with a 1.85 ERA in his last eight starts
against Atlanta, was the loser. John Rocker won in relief.
	   The Braves still may have to beat Brown, who pitched a shutout
in Game 2, one more time in this series. He had been scheduled to
pitch Game 6 Wednesday against Tom Glavine, but Bochy said he
probably use Sterling Hitchcock instead. Brown would be ready for
Game 7 against Maddux, if necessary.
	   Either way, Atlanta already has made history. No team that
trailed a seven-game series 3-0 had ever come back to win two
games.
	   Brown didn't look nearly as sharp as he did when he won 3-0 on a
three-hitter Thursday night in Atlanta. He walked Ryan Klesko
leading off the eighth and Javy Lopez reached on an infield single.
With one out, Tucker lined a 3-2 pitch over the right-field fence
to give Atlanta a 5-4 lead.
	   With the crowd of 58,988 sitting stunned, Tucker, who finished
with five RBIs, pumped his fist as he rounded first and looked at
the spot where the ball landed, as if amazed he really did it
against Brown.
	   ``It was a tough one,'' Tucker said. ``I got a couple of tough
strikes, fouled a couple off. Then I remembered something my father
told me: `You can't swing hard and hope to hit it hard.' I just got
it nice and easy and got it out of the ballpark.''
	   The Braves added two more runs off reliever Donne Wall, keyed by
Tony Graffanino's double.
	   Tucker was booed when he came to bat in the ninth.
	   The Padres were nine outs from clinching the pennant Sunday
night when Atlanta rallied for six runs, capped by Andres
Galarraga's grand slam in the seventh, to win 8-3.
	   Ken Caminiti and John Vander Wal hit clutch two-out, two-run
homers off John Smoltz, whose 11 postseason wins are the most ever.
Caminiti's homer came in the first inning for a 2-0 lead and Vander
Wal's in the sixth for a 4-2 lead.
	   Smoltz came in 3-0 with two no-decisions in five postseason
starts when Atlanta faced elimination this decade. He beat Chicago
in the division series for his 11th postseason victory, the most
ever.
	   Vander Wal, acquired late in the season mainly because he hits
Braves pitchers so well, broke a 2-all tie when he homered to left
on an 0-2 pitch with two outs in the sixth.
	   Vander Wal, hitting .438 lifetime against Smoltz, made his
second start in place of Vaughn, San Diego's 50-homer man.
	   Tucker singled in the Braves' first two runs, in the fourth and
sixth innings, both off starter Andy Ashby.
	   Ashby allowed four straight one-out singles in the fourth,
including Tucker's to cut San Diego's lead to 2-1. With runners on
first and third and Smoltz bunting, the Padres pitched out on a
squeeze play and Andruw Jones in a rundown, with Ashby tagging him
out at the plate.
	   Smoltz hit a dribbler down the third-base line that Ashby and
Caminiti let roll, hoping it would go foul, but it hit the chalk
line and rolled back fair, putting runners on the corners. Ozzie
Guillen ended the threat when he flied out to center.
	   The Braves tied it at 2 in the sixth. Jones singled with two
outs and stole second. The Padres chose to pitch to Tucker with
Smoltz coming up, and he hit a tying single to center.
	   Smoltz allowed four runs and nine hits in 6 2-3 innings, struck
out eight and walked one. Ashby gave up two runs and nine hits in
six innings.
 &UR; Notes: &LR;  Ozzie Guillen, who hit the go-ahead single Sunday and was
on base when Galarraga hit his grand slam, started again at
shortstop and batted leadoff. ... The ceremonial first pitch was
thrown by Randy Jones, who won San Diego's first Cy Young Award in
1976.

Former Soviet states leaning towards agricultural protectionism,
</HEADLINE>
expert warns &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Their economies struggling, Russia
and other former Soviet states may reject international moves to
free agricultural trade and return to policies of protectionism, a
specialist in agriculture in the region warned Tuesday.
	   Agricultural economist Csaba Csaski of Budapest University told
the 45th World Food Production conference that agriculture
industries in central and eastern European were in a rut with their
often rich resources underutilized.
	   But while some countries in the region were showing signs of
recovery in the agricultural sector, the situation was very
different in former states of the Soviet Union.
	   Demands were increasing for protection of internal agricultural
markets in the Commonwealth of Independent States, a confederation
of many ex-Soviet republics, and Russia.
	   ``They see imports as one of the constraints to complete the
reform transition, therefore there is a significant pressure from
the farming side to increase trade barriers and become more
protectionist,'' Csaski said.
	   Csaski said the inclusion of former Soviet republics such as the
Ukraine into the World Trade Organization was vital as soon as
possible to bind them to world trade rules.
	   ``It seems likely that the agrarian trade policy of the CIS
countries will shift towards growing protectionism unless the
protracted entry of Russia and Ukraine to the WTO sets limits to
this unfavorable change.''
	   He said the region was unlikely to be a significant contributor
to global food production for up to 10 years.
	   He said government intervention in former Soviet countries was a
major factor in stifling agricultural reforms and progress.

	   In Denver, Dominik Hasek stopped 32 shots for his 34th career
shutout as the Buffalo Sabres beat the Colorado Avalanche.
	   Jason Woolley and Michael Peca scored power-play goals to help
the Sabres avoid losing consecutive games for the first time since
Dec. 27-29. Buffalo opened the season Saturday night with a 4-1
loss in Dallas.
	   Hasek, the winner of consecutive Hart and Vezina trophies, made
a diving save against Joe Sakic late in the game to preserve the
shutout. Buffalo survived seven shorthanded situations after
allowing three power-play goals in its season-opening loss.

Tyson attorney says report shows fighter both mentally and
</HEADLINE>
physically fit &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout with source details on psychiatric report.
TRIMS, no pick up &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson has extremely low self esteem and is
often depressed, but psychiatrists believe he is truly sorry he bit
Evander Holyfield's ears and is mentally fit to return to the ring,
a source told The Associated Press.
	   A report by a team of psychiatrists portrays Tyson as being
uncomfortable with his superstar status and recommends that he
undergo regular psychotherapy, a source familiar with the report
said.
	   The source, however, told the AP that the report concludes by
saying Tyson is ``mentally fit to return to boxing, to comply with
the rules and regulations, and to do so without repetition of the
events of June 28, 1997.''
	   The report says Tyson does not need any medication for
psychological problems and is ``highly motivated to avoid
repetition'' of the type of behavior that led him to bite Holyfield
during their heavyweight title fight 15 months ago.
	   A team of six doctors who examined Tyson last month at
Massachusetts General Hospital wrote the report, which was given to
the Nevada State Athletic Commission just minutes before a deadline
Monday. The examiners included a neuropsychologist, psychiatrist,
clinical psychologist, two neurologists and a doctor-lawyer.
	   The report is scheduled to be made public Tuesday morning, but
the AP was given some details of its findings under the condition
that the source not be revealed.
	   According to the source, the report recommends that Tyson
``undergo regular psychotherapy with a goal of building trusting
relationships and managing, understanding and managing his
emotional responses.''
	   But, in response to the commission's main question, it says the
``risk of another major boxing offense is ``low.''
	   Earlier, Tyson's attorney said the psychological exams show that
the former heavyweight champion is mentally and physically fit to
return to the ring.
	   ``He is sound mentally, he is sound physically, and he is sound
neurologically,'' attorney Jim Jimmerson said Monday.
	   However, Jimmerson acknowledged that there are certain aspects
of the report that Tyson would prefer the public not see.
	   ``It is a hard-hitting report,'' Jimmerson said. ``There are
going to be things that talk about his innermost thoughts and
innermost feelings.''
	   Jimmerson said he reviewed the reports for two hours on Monday
and turned them over to the Nevada Athletic Commission three
minutes before the deadline for next Monday's hearing on whether
Tyson will be granted a new boxing license.
	   The commission plans to release copies of the reports at 11 a.m.
EDT (1500 GMT) Tuesday.
	   Jimmerson said the reports answer ``in the affirmative'' the
five questions the commissioners asked the doctors at Massachusetts
General Hospital to answer during their five days of evaluating
Tyson.
	   The major question asked by the commission was whether the
doctors believe Tyson is mentally fit to compete without having
another incident like his biting of Evander Holyfield's ears.
	   The other questions centered around Tyson's ability to handle
stress and his current mental diagnosis.
	   Earlier Monday, Tyson lost a fight to keep the records out of
public view.
	   A divided Nevada Supreme Court refused to block a lower court's
order that allows the documents to be made public once they are
given to the athletic commission.
	   Though the court rejected the motion to keep the records secret,
two of the five justices questioned why all the details of Tyson's
psychological tests had to be revealed.
	   ``Today's majority ruling unfairly and needlessly puts Mr. Tyson
in a dilemma: He may choose, to his great personal and financial
loss, to withdraw his application, or he must risk the
embarrassment that may result from the unlawful release of
confidential matters,'' Justice Charles Springer said in dissent.
	   But Justice Miriam Shearing, siding with the majority, said that
Tyson was seeking a privileged license to box, and that the
commission has no authority to edit the reports to keep
embarrassing details out of public view.
	   Tyson issued a statement which indicated he was not happy the
reports were released, but that he would do anything necessary to
get licensed again.
	   ``On numerous occasions I have apologized for my actions in the
ring versus Evander Holyfield,'' Tyson said. ``I am willing to do
whatever the Nevada Athletic Commission wants me to do in order to
regain my license to fight.''
	   Tyson and his advisers wanted to meet the deadline so next
Monday's hearing could go on as scheduled because they want Tyson
to have a comeback fight in December if he gets his license back.

Vietnam legislative session to open Oct. 28

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's National Assembly will open its
biannual month-long session on Oct. 28, with the fallout from the
Asian economic crisis expected to head the agenda.
	   The country's legislature also will be trying to deal with
complaints about excessive red tape, along with suggested changes
to land and education laws.
	   The starting date was set at a two-day meeting of the National
Assembly's powerful Standing Committee that ended Saturday.
	   Although Vietnam has not been hit as hard as some other
countries by the regional economic downturn, it has seen its growth
rate and foreign investment slow dramatically. Unemployment has
been rising.

Senior officials to discuss lowering economic targets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The decision-making Communist Party
Central Committee opened a four-day plenum Tuesday to discuss
financial issues, including lowering economic targets for next
year, a party source said.
	   The 167-member committee is expected to recommend lower goals
for approval by the National Assembly, when it opens its month-long
session later this month.
	   Faced with the deepening impact of the regional economic crisis,
the National Assembly Standing Committee in July decided to cut the
country's growth target from 9 percent to between 6 percent and 7
percent.
	   The Central Committee will discuss general economic issues, with
a focus on those relating to agriculture and rural development, the
source said.
	   Another plenum is scheduled in December.

Israel lifts curfew in Hebron, eases blockade of Palestinian areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel Tuesday lifted the curfew it had
maintained for the 13 days on the Palestinian residents of downtown
Hebron, the army spokesman said.
	   The Israeli army also eased the total blockade which it imposed
11 days ago on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. As of Tuesday,
21,000 Palestinian workers were allowed to go to their jobs in
Israel, the spokesman said.
	   The total closure had been in force with brief respites for 22
days, since the beginning of the Jewish holiday period.
	   It was eased briefly, but reimposed after Israeli security
services warned that the Islamic Hamas group planned to carry out a
major suicide bomb attack or kidnap an Israeli soldier in
retaliation for the killing of two of its leaders by Israeli
special forces.
	   Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in
Israel since 1994, killing scores of Israelis.
	   The curfew in downtown Hebron was imposed after a suspected
Palestinian attacker threw two grenades at Israeli soldiers and
border police Sept. 30, wounding 14 of them and 11 Palestinian
bystanders. The attacker reportedly escaped into the
Palestinian-controlled part of the city.
	   The Israeli army controls a number of enclaves in the center of
Hebron to protect about 450 Jewish settlers who live there. About
30,000 Palestinians live in the enclaves. During the curfew the
Palestinians were unable to leave their homes except for a brief
interlude each day to enable them to buy provisions.
	   The Israeli closures cause extensive economic hardship in the
Palestinian areas, where unemployment is high. Before the closure
was imposed on Sept. 20, about 60,000 Palestinians had permits to
work in Israel.
	   Palestinian leaders have condemned the closures as collective
punishment.

Plane makes emergency landing in central Russia, all on board safe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The passengers and crew members of a small
commercial plane waited for rescuers in the mountains of central
Russia on Tuesday after being forced to make an emergency landing,
the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The An-2 plane was forced to land Monday in the Bashkortostan
Mountains because of an electrical problem, the news agency said.
	   The two pilots and 12 passengers were waiting for rescuers who
were on their way to the remote region, it said, quoting the
Ministry for Emergency Situations. It said they have food and fresh
water.
	   Thick fog prevented a helicopter from evacuating the people.

 &UR; Asian countries having more trouble recovering, conference hears
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The restructuring that Asian economies need to
emerge from recession is being delayed by political instability, a
rise in protectionism, and lack of money from a fearful world,
high-ranking speakers told a gloomy Asian economic conference
Tuesday.
	   ``In a severe crisis, countries, like individuals, become
preoccupied with survival and become more self-centered and
selfish,'' George Yeo, Singapore's second minister for trade and
industry, told the East Asia Economic Summit.
	   ``What we are seeing now is a financial El Nino sweeping the
world,'' Yeo said. ``The crux of the problem is no longer economic,
but political, and because of that it will take a long time to
recover.''
	   Thailand's deputy prime minister, Supachai Panitchpakdi, said
the protectionist trend, coupled with a contraction of export
markets as economies slow down worldwide, could hamstring the Asian
recovery.
	   ``I'm deeply worried about expanding export subsidies. I'm also
worried about anti-dumping duties being applied more than in the
past,'' Supachai said, adding that the ``culprits'' were mostly
Asian countries targeting their struggling neighbors.
	   Supachai also lamented the high cost of borrowing fresh capital
to create jobs and spur sluggish economies. He called the current
rates ``capital punishment.''
	   ``There may be some rationale,'' he said, ``but it's not the
kind of rationale that would prevent the world from going into
recession.''
	   Supachai, who is also commerce minister, had some bad news on
what is still needed to fix Thailand's banking system. He said
non-performing loans could amount to 1.8 trillion baht (dlrs 47
billion), ``an exorbitant level ... which is six times the amount
of capital the government is putting into the banking system.''
	   Almost everyone agrees on the restructuring that the crisis-hit
Asian nations need to save themselves and stem the contagion, said
Hubert Neiss, the International Monetary Fund's Asia-Pacific
director.
	   But the dilemma is that the policy changes require strong
political courage at a time when the economic changes themselves
cause people to doubt their governments.
	   Balance sheets must be cleared of bad loans, insolvent banks
closed, weak ones recapitalized, fiscal policy must be refocused on
projects that encourage investment and create jobs, and social
safety nets need to be erected in Asian countries that did not have
them before, Neiss said.
	   ``This shift in fiscal policy has resulted in substantial
deficits in most'' of the crisis-hit countries, he said. ``These
restructurings ... are very difficult to implement and are
politically charged.''
	   The summit is sponsored by the World Economic Forum, a private
agency based in Switzerland that brings together political and
business leaders.
	   Neiss gave the group a pesimistic overview of the current state
of Southeast Asia.
	   ``Financial markets are still fragile, which limits somewhat the
scope of action by the governments,'' Neiss said. No stimulus from
Japan is expected over the next two years, and ``earlier panic has
left banking and corporate sectors badly damaged.''

Imelda Marcos ready for a compromise over Swiss accounts
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Former first lady Imelda Marcos,
appearing in public for the first time since being acquitted of
graft, indicated Tuesday she was ready for a settlement to share
her late husband's dlrs 540 million in Swiss bank deposits.
	   The money, frozen since the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos was
ousted in a popular revolt in 1986, has been transferred to an
escrow account in a Philippine bank.
	   It is being claimed by the Marcos family, the government and
9,539 Filipinos who won a class action suit in a Hawaii court for
human rights violations during Marcos' authoritarian rule.
	   President Joseph Estrada and other administration officials say
at least 30 percent of the money should be used to compensate
victims of Marcos' rule.
	   ``For my part I only want what's good for all,'' Mrs. Marcos
said. ``I hope that we can arrive at a decision that will benefit
everybody because I always believe that a decision that is good for
all is good for one.''
	   She also said a settlement ``is long, long overdue and it is a
great injustice to everybody, including the government and the
Filipino people.''
	   But she said she will not accept negotiations that would make it
appear that justice was for sale.
	   ``If the perception is the government is selling justice and we
are buying justice, that is unacceptable and that is wrong,'' she
said. ``I did not suffer for the past 13 years just to compromise
what is right and what is the truth.''
	   Mrs. Marcos said her husband had left instructions on how the
Swiss assets may be used once his family recovers them, but did not
elaborate.
	   She also said, however, that she has not yet been called to a
meeting with government representatives.
	   Presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora has said
preliminary talks have been held with the Marcos family, but he did
not say who has participated in the meetings.
	   Zamora has said the Estrada government favors an out-of-court
settlement since 12 years of litigation has produced little in
recovering the alleged ill-gotten wealth.
	   Mrs. Marcos was mobbed by hundreds of her supporters, some of
them wearing white T-shirts imprinted with pictures of Ferdinand
Marcos, as she arrived for a thanksgiving mass at a 19th century
church in Manila's Tondo district.
	   The Supreme Court last week acquitted her of a corruption
conviction in 1993, overturning the only case in which she had been
found guilty of graft during her late husband's rule and sparing
her a 12-year jail term.
	   Mrs. Marcos still faces numerous other criminal and civil cases
related to her husband's 20-year rule.
	   The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is also asking her to settle
more than dlrs 5 million in unpaid taxes from 1986 to 1991, the
years of exile in Hawaii where Ferdinand Marcos died in 1989.
	   Mrs. Marcos questioned the U.S. tax claims, saying, ``I do not
know why we have to pay taxes when we did not have any livelihood
and we had no funds coming from abroad.''

Nobel science prizes mark high-flying discoveries

 &UR; Eds: Physics prize to be announced no earlier than 0945 GMT,

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A Nobel Prize for physics or chemistry
is the symbolic midpoint for a scientist's work _ it comes years
after the research is done and years before a layman understands
it.
	   The prizes reward work at an extraordinarily high level of
expertise, with the winners spending years researching minute and
obscure phenomena. This year's prizes, worth dlrs 978,000, will be
announced Tuesday.
	   Last year's physics laureates, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of France
and William Phillips and Steven Chu of the United States, were
honored for developing ways of trapping atoms of gas and cooling
them to within a millionth of a degree of absolute zero.
	   The work led to developing extraordinarily accurate atomic
clocks. Previous atomic clocks weren't exactly sloppy, being
accurate to about one second in 32 million years _ but the
improvements made possible a clock that loses just one second every
3 billion years.
	   It also led to the creation of an entirely new form of matter,
achieving what Albert Einstein had postulated was possible some 70
years earlier.
	   The 1997 chemistry winners, American Paul D. Boyer, John E.
Walker of Britain and Jens C. Skou of Denmark, discovered aspects
of how the body's cells store and use energy, a fundamental process
that affects everything from the building of bones to the
transmission of nerve impulses.
	   The physics and chemistry prizes are the third and fourth Nobels
to be awarded this year.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   Furchgott, 82, is a pharmacologist at the State University of
New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn; Ignarro, 57, is at the
University of California at Los Angeles; and Murad, 62, is at the
University of Texas Medical School in Houston.
	   Their finding helped lead to the discovery of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra and could also pay off in new treatments for heart
disease, cancer and septic shock.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago. The economics prize winner is to be named
on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
	   All the prizes are announced in Stockholm, except for the peace
prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes
in his will.

UN makes exception to travel ban because 'stakes too high'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The United Nations made an exception
to its ban on travel to Afghanistan for its special envoy Lakhdar
Brahimi because ``the stakes are much too high,'' a U.N. official
said Tuesday.
	   Brahimi will make a one-day visit Wednesday to southern Kandahar
where he is expected to meet the Taliban's reclusive leader Mullah
Mohammed Omar, a first for a U.N. representative, said James Ngobi,
acting head of the U.N. special mission headquarters in Pakistan.
	   Successive attempts by Brahimi's predecessors have failed to
bring about a face-to-face meeting with Omar, the man who controls
the hardline Taliban religious militia and rules 90 percent of
Afghanistan.
	   It is Omar's interpretation of the Muslim holy book, the Koran,
that has resulted in the strict rules in force throughout
Taliban-controlled areas.
	   Women are not allowed to work, school for girls are closed, men
are required to wear beards and a head covering. Most forms of
light entertainment have been banned and prayer five times a day is
compulsory.
	   Brahimi is trying to find a peaceful end to the stand off
between the Taliban religious army and neighboring Iran, which
deployed 200,000 soldiers to its border with Afghanistan after a
group of Iranian diplomats were killed by Taliban soldiers in
August.
	   Before agreeing to go to Kandahar, Brahimi received guarantees
from the Taliban that they will give a ``full explanation'' behind
the attacks on U.N. workers, including the death of an Italian
official in August, said Ngobi.
	   The U.N. pulled its international staff out of Afghanistan on
Aug. 21, after a U.N. worker was shot and killed, in apparent
retaliation for the U.S. missile attack on suspected terrorist
camps in eastern Afghanistan.
	   ``The Taliban until now have not been able to explain the
circumstances of the U.N. workers who have been murdered, shot at
and harassed ... we said we do not go back until these things are
addressed,'' Ngobi told The Associated Press in an interview.
	   Brahimi received promises from Taliban officials that he will
get the explanations he is seeking in Kandahar.
	   ``The Taliban have convinced Brahimi and through him the (U.N.)
secretary general'' to make an exception to the travel ban, he
said.
	   Tehran is demanding an apology from the Taliban, the culprits
who killed the diplomats and the return of an estimated 50 Iranians
being held in Kandahar by the Taliban.
	   ``This is what he is going (to Kandahar) to negotiate,'' said
Ngobi. ``He will see how far the Taliban are willing to go.''

Five die trying to steal wires from power lines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Five people have been killed so far this year
trying to steal wires from power lines in the Jewish Autonomous
Region in eastern Russia, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Tuesday.
	   A 13-year-old boy was seriously burned in the latest attempted
theft on Monday, the news agency said, quoting an official for the
Birobidzhan power company, Vladimir Ryabtsev.
	   Stealing wires from power lines is a common crime in Russia. The
wires, which contain copper, are sold or used for scrap metal.
	   ITAR-Tass said thieves have stolen 90 kilometers (56 miles) of
wires from power lines in the Jewish Autonomous Region and damaged
28 power stations.

Israel lifts curfew in Hebron, eases blockade of Palestinian areas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israel Tuesday lifted the curfew it had
maintained for the 13 days on the Palestinian residents of downtown
Hebron, residents said.
	   Israel also eased the total blockade which it imposed 11 days
ago on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. As of Tuesday, 21,000
Palestinian workers were allowed to go to their jobs in Israel, the
army spokesman said.
	   The total closure had been in force with brief respites for 22
days, since the beginning of the Jewish holiday period.
	   It was eased briefly, but reimposed after Israeli security
services warned that the Islamic Hamas group planned to carry out a
major suicide bomb attack or kidnap an Israeli soldier in
retaliation for the killing of two of its leaders by Israeli
special forces.
	   Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in
Israel since 1994, killing scores of Israelis.
	   The curfew in downtown Hebron was imposed after a suspected
Palestinian attacker threw two grenades at Israeli soldiers and
border police Sept. 30, wounding 14 of them and 11 Palestinian
bystanders. The attacker reportedly escaped into the
Palestinian-controlled part of the city.
	   The Israeli army controls a number of enclaves in the center of
Hebron to protect about 450 Jewish settlers who live there. About
30,000 Palestinians live in the enclaves. During the curfew the
Palestinians were unable to leave their homes except for a brief
interlude each day to enable them to buy provisions.
	   The Israeli closures cause extensive economic hardship in the
Palestinian areas, where unemployment is high. Before the closure
was imposed on Sept. 20, about 60,000 Palestinians had permits to
work in Israel.
	   Palestinian leaders have condemned the closures as collective
punishment.

 &UR; Southeast Asian exports slow, despite currency devaluations

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Exports from Southeast Asian countries have
slowed since the start of the region's financial crisis,
confounding hopes that their currency devaluations would allow them
to export their way out of the turmoil, officials said Tuesday.
	   ``It's been more than a year since the devaluations,'' said
Rodolfo Severino, secretary general of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations. ``There has been no export response from the ASEAN
countries. Quite the contrary.''
	   Normally, a lower exchange rate would make a nation's products
more competitive overseas. Many economists had predicted that the
sharp currency devaluations that resulted from the crisis, which
hit in July 1997, would create an export surge as the countries
attempted to recover economically.
	   But Severino and other officials attending an East Asia Economic
Summit said a shortage of credit caused by banking problems, weak
worldwide demand, and heavy loan burdens among producers had
thwarted export hopes.
	   Total ASEAN exports grew 6.34 percent in 1997 to dlrs 351.6
billion, compared to average annual growth of 16.5 percent during
the 1993-96 period, Severino said. Exports were virtually flat in
the second half of the year as the effects of the crisis began, he
said.
	   The slow growth continued in the first quarter of 1998, with
total ASEAN exports rising only 5.17 percent from a year earlier,
he said.
	   Exports to economically troubled Japan, one of the region's main
markets, shrank by 2.6 percent from 1996 to 1997, while exports to
the European Union fell 1.8 percent.
	   ``Clearly, the economic recovery of the ASEAN countries cannot
depend on an export surge actuated by the mere devaluation of their
currencies,'' Severino said.
	   He said ASEAN's ability to expand exports requires increased
demand in developed countries, particularly Japan, and financial
reforms that will give exporters increased trade financing.
	   South Korea, although not a member of ASEAN, has also faced
disappointing export growth, said Han Duk-soo, the country's
minister of state for trade.
	   ``Trade is extremely important for countries coming out of the
financial crisis,'' he said. ``But actually it hasn't increased so
much.''
	   As a result, ``now we are attempting to stimulate domestic
demand so that economic growth won't be hurt as much,'' he said.

Most Asian stock markets fall on profit taking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Despite strong rallies on Wall Street and in
Europe overnight, most Asian stock markets took a breather early
Tuesday following their recent strong run.
	   Profit-taking dragged share prices in Japan, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and South Korea slightly lower.
	   In Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 176.18 points,
or 1.3 percent, to 13,378.83 in early afternoon trading, as
excitement about financial stabilization bills enacted Monday
started to wear off. The Nikkei rose 675.04 points, or 5.24
percent, on Monday.
	   ``Gains in U.S. stocks are giving some relief, although
investors cashed in near-term profits after Monday's steep gains,''
said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities.
	   On Wall Street overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average
closed Monday's trading session at 8,001.47 points, up 101.95, or
1.3 percent.
	   But traders said the downside for Japan's benchmark index may be
limited by the expected passage through Parliament later this week
of bills aimed at recapitalizing the country's debt-ridden banks.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index finished the choppy
morning session 0.9 percent lower at 8,908.17 points, after gaining
19 percent in the past four trading sessions.
	   Singapore's share prices were slightly lower, with the Straits
Times Index shedding 1.0 percent to 1,066.62 points in early
trading.
	   Asian bourses and currencies strengthened in recent sessions as
market players expect a fresh round of global interest rate cuts
and more joint efforts by industrialized nations to restore
international financial order.
	   Fueled by Asia's rallies and growing optimism that the worst is
now over, Wall Street closed 1.3 percent higher, and the key
indexes in Europe climbed between 4.44 percent to 7 percent Monday.
	   Still, Abhilit Chakrabortti, regional strategist for HSBC
Securities Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong, warned: ``The global environment
has improved a bit, but not much.''
	   ``The only reason we're talking about interest rate decline is
because we're in deep distress,'' he said.
	   In currency trading, the U.S. dollar bought 118.41 yen at
midday, up 1.69 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its
late New York level of 117.63 yen overnight.
	   Japanese investors bought the dollar on growing speculation the
Bank of Japan may announce a further easing of its monetary policy
after a policy board meeting later Tuesday, traders said.
	   Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less
attractive to investors.

Murdoch: News Corp. readying for market downturn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ The global economic environment
appears to be moving towards deflation and News Corp. was bracing
for a significant downturn in world markets, media magnate Rupert
Murdoch said Tuesday.
	   Addressing the annual general meeting of his News Corp. Ltd.,
company chief executive Murdoch said there had been substantial
shocks to the world's financial systems and there may be more to
come in the next few months.
	   ``We seem to be moving to a period of deflation,'' he told
shareholders.
	   Murdoch said News Corp. was not planning any significant
acquisitions as it braces for a significant downturn in world
markets, and that the company would remain cashed up amid the
market volatility.
	   Murdoch said News Corp. had positioned itself earlier this year
by refinancing from short-term debt to long-term debt. He noted
that the company had no significant repayments over the next five
years.
	   Murdoch said News Corp. had significant sums of cash at the bank
and that ``we intend to keep it that way until we see more clearly
what the future holds.''
	   He also said he was confident of a strong year ahead for the
company's Filmed Entertainment business.
	   ``We are feeling fairly bullish about it and we expect to have
another very good year,'' Murdoch said, adding the company was
currently on a good streak with its movies.
	   The success of multiple academy award winner Titanic helped
boost News Corp. profits last financial year. Titanic reaped
Australian dollars 3 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.8 billion) at the box
office.
	   News Corp. posted an annual net profit of Australian dollars
1.68 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.04 billion) for the financial year ended
June 30, 1998.
	   As well as Titanic, News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox
subsidiary released the hugely popular, low budget film The Full
Monty.
	   Murdoch said the global media group had a strong schedule of
movies coming on stream over the next two years and while there was
no guessing as to if they will be successful, he was ``very
confident indeed about the future there.''
	   Murdoch also said that the public float of subsidiary Fox
Entertainment Group would go ahead.
	   News Corp. plans to take this unit public, offering 13.4 percent
of the shares in Fox Entertainment to raise between Australian
dollars 1.5-2 billion (U.S. dlrs 900 million-1.2 billion).

Taiwan urges China to begin dialogue on the right note
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ On the eve of new talks between China and
Taiwan, a top Taiwanese official said Tuesday they could be a
success if China acknowledges its separation from the island.
	   The talks, the first official meeting between China and its
neighbor in three years, begin on Wednesday in Shanghai, involving
senior statesmen Koo Chen-fu of Taiwan and Wang Daohan of China.
	   Koo and his wife also plan to meet with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin on Sunday in Beijing.
	   Both sides appear to believe that a key goal is for China and
the island it considers a renegade province to agree to meet with
each another on a regular basis for formal talks.
	   In Taipei on Tuesday, Chang King-yu, Taiwan's top official for
China affairs, said this week's informal meetings provide a chance
for both sides to better understand each others' positions.
	   But he said China must be realistic.
	   ``We hope the mainland side can pragmatically face the issues
that the two sides need to resolve,'' Chang said at a news
conference. ``Only by respecting the reality of separation between
the sides can there be a breakthrough in relations.''
	   He also said that China should call off its diplomatic
suppression of Taiwan and its military threats against the island
for the sake of better ties.
	   In another development, Jan Jyh-horng, an official leading a
Taiwanese advance team, negotiated for an additional meeting on
Thursday in Shanghai between Koo and Wang, the TVBS television
network reported. Taiwan also hopes that China will permit its
12-person delegation to meet with Zemin on Sunday in Beijing, along
with Koo and his wife, Yen Cho-yun, the station said.
	   Koo and Wang will meet for the first time since their 1993 talks
in Singapore, the initial formal contact between the two sides
since they split during a civil war in 1949.
	   The two sides talked then about practical issues such as mutual
recognition of legal documents, but an agreement proved elusive,
and in 1995 China suspended the talks in anger over Taiwan's
campaign to raise its international profile.
	   China says the breakaway province has no right to foreign
relations and refuses to recognize the government in Taipei.
	   During this week's meetings, China has demanded that Taiwan at
least begin to discuss political issues related to reunification
before the formal dialogue can resume on a regular basis.
	   Koo's mission is to persuade China to begin a new round of

 &UR; Asian countries having more trouble recovering, conference hears

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The restructuring that Asian economies need to
emerge from recession is being delayed by political instability, a
rise in protectionism, and lack of money from a fearful world,
high-ranking speakers told a gloomy Asian economic conference
Tuesday.
	   ``In a severe crisis, countries, like individuals, become
preoccupied with survival and become more self-centered and
selfish,'' George Yeo, Singapore's second minister for trade and
industry, told the East Asia Economic Summit.
	   ``What we are seeing now is a financial El Nino sweeping the
world,'' Yeo said. ``The crux of the problem is no longer economic,
but political, and because of that it will take a long time to
recover.''
	   Thailand's deputy prime minister, Supachai Panitchpakdi, said
the protectionist trend, coupled with a contraction of export
markets as economies slow down worldwide, could hamstring the Asian
recovery.
	   ``I'm deeply worried about expanding export subsidies. I'm also
worried about anti-dumping duties being applied more than in the
past,'' Supachai said, adding that the ``culprits'' were mostly
Asian countries targeting their struggling neighbors.
	   Supachai also lamented the high cost of borrowing fresh capital
to create jobs and spur sluggish economies. He called the current
rates ``capital punishment.''
	   ``There may be some rationale,'' he said, ``but it's not the
kind of rationale that would prevent the world from going into
recession.''
	   Supachai, who is also commerce minister, had some bad news on
what is still needed to fix Thailand's banking system. He said
non-performing loans could amount to 1.8 trillion baht (dlrs 47
billion), ``an exorbitant level ... which is six times the amount
of capital the government is putting into the banking system.''
	   Almost everyone agrees on the restructuring that the crisis-hit
Asian nations need to save themselves and stem the contagion, said
Hubert Neiss, the International Monetary Fund's Asia-Pacific
director.
	   But the dilemma is that the policy changes require strong
political courage at a time when the economic changes themselves
cause people to doubt their governments.
	   Balance sheets must be cleared of bad loans, insolvent banks
closed, weak ones recapitalized, fiscal policy must be refocused on
projects that encourage investment and create jobs, and social
safety nets need to be erected in Asian countries that did not have
them before, Neiss said.
	   ``This shift in fiscal policy has resulted in substantial
deficits in most'' of the crisis-hit countries, he said. ``These
restructurings ... are very difficult to implement and are
politically charged.''
	   The summit is sponsored by the World Economic Forum, a private
agency based in Switzerland that brings together political and
business leaders.
	   Neiss gave the group a pessimistic overview of the current state
of Southeast Asia.
	   ``Financial markets are still fragile, which limits somewhat the
scope of action by the governments,'' Neiss said. No stimulus from
Japan is expected over the next two years, and ``earlier panic has
left banking and corporate sectors badly damaged.''
	   Some participants said the regional healing will have to come
from within, and only if Asia boosts its own domestic demand.
	   ``We have undervalued the importance of domestic markets,'' said
Seiji Tsutsumi, chairman of Japan's Saison Corporation. ``If you
have an industrial structure depending on exports, that's a very
vulnerable economy.''

Japan wants to reach common ground with China over war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said Tuesday Japan
hopes to reach a mutual understanding with China over the painful
wartime history between the two nations in time for President Jiang
Zemin's upcoming visit.
	   Komura told a news conference the two sides are in final
discussions aimed at reaching a common understanding of Japan's
aggression against China, which began in the early 1930s and lasted
through the end of World War II.
	   ``It would be nice if we can issue a joint statement,'' he said,
though would not provide details as the two sides were still
ironing out details.
	   The move regarding China follows Japan's fullest-ever apology to
South Korea over its 35-year colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.
	   The joint declaration, signed by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, also vowed to put behind the
painful past and build a new, future-oriented friendship.
	   Jiang's visit, originally scheduled for early September, has
been postponed because of massive flooding in China. He is now
expected by the end of this year, possibly as early as after the
Nov. 17-18 summit of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation Forum in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur.

Indians and Yankees get ready to rumble
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Cone waited a long time for this one.
Tuesday night he gets the ball with the chance to pitch the New
York Yankees into the World Series for the 35th time.
	   ``It's going to be a frenzy, no doubt about it,'' he said
Monday. ``To me, Yankee Stadium is center stage.''
	   Even the Cleveland Indians are bracing for a rowdy crowd when
the AL championship series resumes.
	   ``It's going to be crazy,'' said Charles Nagy, the Indians' Game
6. ``New York is up 3-2 and they are sensing something.''
	   David Wells, who put New York ahead Sunday with his second win
of the series, fumed some more Monday, again blasting the fans at
Jacobs Field who taunted him with references to his deceased
mother. Wells also claimed they were rude to Yankees families.
	   ``Jeff Nelson's baby got hit with a pretzel, got beer tossed on
him,'' Wells said. ``That just goes to show you what kind of class
Cleveland has _ none. None at all.''
	   David Justice practically laughed at the accusation. He's seen a
lot of big game at the Bronx Zoo.
	   ``Yankee fans _ come on now,'' he said. ``They can't get any
more rougher on us unless they show up with Uzis.''
	   Not quite, David. No guns, just blades _ Wally Joyner was hit in
the arm by a knife thrown from Yankee Stadium's upper deck in 1986.
	   Cone, who won the first-round clincher against Texas, gave up
Justice's homer in Game 2. But, like Nagy, he didn't get a decision
in a game the Indians won in 12 innings.
	   Last year, he would have been pitching Game 4 in the first round
against Cleveland, with a chance to close out that one. But his arm
hurt after he was hit hard in the opener and he didn't pitch again
until this spring _ after shoulder surgery.
	   ``I kind of felt like I let our team down last year when I told
Joe Torre I was ready to go, and in reality I probably fooled
myself,'' Cone said. ``It is very gratifying for me to be back in
this position.''
	   New York is a win away from a record 35th AL pennant because of
its pitching, not because of its hitting. Since scoring five runs
in the first inning of the opener, New York batters are just
6-for-39 (.154) with runners in scoring position.
	   ``The first few games, I was trying to do too much,'' said Tino
Martinez, whose ninth-inning double Saturday stopped an 0-for-19
slide.
	   Martinez also joined Wells on the anti-Indians bandwagon.
	   ``The Cleveland fans, they were rough on our families in the
stands,'' he said.
	   Justice, taunted at Yankee Stadium with chants of ``Hal-le
Ber-ry'' (his ex-wife), agreed that Indians' fans crossed the line
by bringing up Wells' mother, who died in January 1997.
	   ``It hurt me, too,'' Justice said. ``I hated that he had to go
through that. But I mean, come on, we are talking about the Yankee
fans. I have heard everything about my mother, everything about my
history, too.''
	   Justice, a diamond bracelet sparkling around his left wrist,
came to Yankee Stadium to criticize ESPN, interpreting a report
Sunday as saying he asked out of Cleveland's lineup in Game 5.
Justice said he suggested to Indians manager Mike Hargrove he hit
seventh instead of third, and that Hargrove decided on his own to
take him out of the lineup.
	   ``I am sure when I get out here tomorrow I am going to hear
people talking about me, saying, `Why did you whine,''' he said.
	   Cleveland didn't work out Monday as the series shifted back to
New York, but most of the Yankees showed up for batting practice.
	   ``We left one jungle and we're coming to ours now,'' Yankees
shortstop Derek Jeter said.
	   Cleveland, which blew a ninth-inning lead in Game 7 of last
year's World Series and lost to Florida, wants to force this series
to the limit. Then the Indians can try to get back into the World
Series _ which they last won 50 years ago.
	   ``I am nervous. I am excited,'' said Nagy, bypassed in favor of
Jaret Wright in that seventh game last year. ``It is the ultimate
stadium, Yankee Stadium. And a must-win game. It is going to be fun
_ I hope.''

Murdoch: News Corp. readying for market downturn
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Minor editing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ The global economic environment
appears to be moving towards deflation and News Corp. was bracing
for a significant downturn in world markets, media magnate Rupert
Murdoch said Tuesday.
	   Addressing the annual general meeting of his News Corp. Ltd.,
company chief executive Murdoch said there had been substantial
shocks to the world's financial systems and there may be more to
come in the next few months.
	   ``We seem to be moving to a period of deflation,'' he told
shareholders.
	   Murdoch said News Corp. was not planning any significant
acquisitions as it braces for a significant downturn in world
markets, and that the company would remain cashed up amid the
market volatility.
	   Murdoch said News Corp. had positioned itself earlier this year
by refinancing from short-term debt to long-term debt. He noted
that the company had no significant repayments over the next five
years.
	   Murdoch said News Corp. had significant sums of cash at the bank
and that ``we intend to keep it that way until we see more clearly
what the future holds.''
	   He also said he was confident of a strong year ahead for the
company's Filmed Entertainment business.
	   ``We are feeling fairly bullish about it and we expect to have
another very good year,'' Murdoch said, adding the company was
currently on a good streak with its movies.
	   The success of multiple academy award winner ``Titanic'' helped
boost News Corp. profits last financial year. ``Titanic'' reaped
Australian dollars 3 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.8 billion) at the box
office.
	   News Corp. posted an annual net profit of Australian dollars
1.68 billion (U.S. dlrs 1.04 billion) for the financial year ended
June 30, 1998.
	   As well as ``Titanic,'' News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox
subsidiary released the hugely popular, low budget film ``The Full
Monty.''
	   Murdoch said the global media group had a strong schedule of
movies coming on stream over the next two years and while there was
no guessing as to if they will be successful, he was ``very
confident indeed about the future there.''
	   Murdoch also said that the public float of subsidiary Fox
Entertainment Group would go ahead.
	   News Corp. plans to take this unit public, offering 13.4 percent
of the shares in Fox Entertainment to raise between Australian
dollars 1.5-2 billion (U.S. dlrs 900 million-1.2 billion).

Dollar higher in mid-afternoon trading, Tokyo stocks end lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with mid-afternoon trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen at
mid-afternoon Tuesday on hopes Japan's central bank may further
ease credit. Japanese stocks closed lower on profit-taking after
Monday's rally.
	   The dollar bought 118.92 yen, up 2.20 yen from late Monday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 117.63 yen
overnight.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 312.22 points, or 2.30
percent, ending the day at 13,242.79. On Monday, the Nikkei surged
675.04 points, or 5.24 percent.
	   Japanese investors bought the dollar on growing speculation the
Bank of Japan might announce a further easing of its monetary
policy after its policy board meeting later Tuesday, traders said.
	   Last month, the BOJ lowered short-term interest rates in an
attempt to lessen a reported credit crunch among small firms
affected by the nation's recession-hit economy.
	   Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less
attractive to investors.
	   But the dollar failed to climb further because of selling orders
made through U.S. banks. Some traders said the sellers were U.S.
hedge funds.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices fell on profit-taking
after a big rise Monday, when the Nikkei rallied following the
passage of legislation aimed at revitalizing Japan's debt-ridden
banking system.
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed Monday's
trading session at 8,001.47 points, up 101.95, or 1.3 percent.
	   Traders are now waiting to see how the government will disburse
public funds to weak but viable banks, traders said.
	   On Tuesday, Japan's lower house of Parliament passed a bill
designed to allow the government to help banks boost capital.
	   Also Tuesday, the Cabinet approved a supplementary budget
proposal that includes 43 trillion yen (dlrs 361 billion) to
stabilize the financial system.
	   Of that, 18 trillion yen (dlrs 151 billion) is earmarked for the
government to purchase shares in banks to be nationalized
temporarily and 25 trillion yen (dlrs 210) to be pumped into weak
but viable banks in need of fresh capital.
	   The extra budget and recapitalization bill are expected to
become law before the current parliamentary session ends Friday.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 24.36, or 2.38 percent, to 998.98. The TOPIX
closed up 40.84 points, or 4.16 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.835 percent from Monday's finish of 0.900 percent,
driving its price up to 108.63 yen from 108.01 yen.

U.N. peacekeeping loses dlrs 23 million in equipment over three
</HEADLINE>
years &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Missing: 1,898 vehicles, 882 computers and
1,787 generators.
	   U.N. peacekeeping missions lost over 16,000 big-ticket items
between 1993 and 1995, at a whopping cost of dlrs 23 million, a
U.N. report said Monday.
	   Most of the goods were stolen, but accidents accounted for
another significant chunk of the lost goods, followed by
disappearances caused by ``acts of war'' or hostilities, the report
said. Negligence on the part of U.N. staff was also to blame.
	   The report covered only U.N. peacekeeping operations from those
three years, and represented only a fraction of what the United
Nations may have lost in all of its other missions, including
refugee operations, humanitarian aid and civilian police forces.
	   The United Nations prepared the report after the main U.N.
budget committee documented the tremendous losses incurred by the
U.N. transitional authority in Cambodia _ an estimated dlrs 6
million over the course of the mission.
	   The United Nations outdid itself preparing for Cambodia's 1993
elections that eventually created an alliance between strongman Hun
Sen and Prince Ranariddh. The U.N. mission spent millions to create
a showcase for helping spread democracy to the world, sending into
Cambodia fancy 4-wheel drive vehicles and peacekeepers from around
the world.
	   Based on those huge losses, the budget committee asked the U.N.
chief to report on all peacekeeping missions _ and list measures
taken to try to keep track of U.N. goods.
	   Many of the report's recommendations are straightforward:
install a fence, lights or alarms and keep better track of vehicles
and who is allowed to drive them. But the report cautions that
sometimes prevention measures can actually cost more than the goods
that are being protected, since that could involve hiring more U.N.
military police or investigators.
	   The report found that over three years, U.N. peacekeeping
missions lost 16,337 items _ each of which cost dlrs 1,500 or more,
or were considered to be of an ``attractive nature'' such as
cameras. Items lost or damaged due to natural disasters or regular
wear and tear weren't included.
	   Vehicles _ including jeeps, sedans, mini-buses, trailers and
trucks _ made up the bulk of the missing goods and amounted to dlrs
15.8 million of the losses, the U.N. report said.
	   Seven thousand items from housing units disappeared, as did 561
items for radio stations and workshops. Phones, faxes and other
communication equipment constituted 1,578 of the missing items.
	   But it was the Cambodian experience that was the most
remarkable. According to the report, stolen U.N. property could be
seen for sale in local shops.
	   In the final months of the mission, theft ``was so rampant that
as much of the property as possible was immediately shipped out of
the country'' by the United Nations, the report said.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Here is the official text of a
statement read by NATO Secretary General Javier Solana Tuesday
after the meeting of the NATO ambassadors:
	   ``A few hours ago we were briefed by Ambassador (Richard)
Holbrooke on his efforts to resolve the crisis in Kosovo.
	   ``Ambassador Holbrooke reported that there has been progress.
	   ``He stressed that this progress was largely due to the pressure
of the Alliance in the last few days and that we have to maintain
this pressure in order to ensure continued progress.
	   ``In response, just a few moments ago, the North Atlantic
Council decided to issue activation orders - ACTORDs - for both
limited air strikes and a phased air campaign in Yugoslavia,
execution of which will begin in approximately 96 hours.
	   ``We took this decision after a thorough review of the situation
in Kosovo.
	   ``The Former Republic of Yugoslavia has still not complied fully
with UNSCR 1199 and time is running out.
	   ``Even at this final hour, I still believe diplomacy can succeed
and the use of military force can be avoided.
	   ``The responsibility is on President Milosevic's shoulders.
	   ``He knows what he has to do.''

Yeltsin stays home with respiratory infection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin stayed home Tuesday,
nursing a respiratory infection that forced him to cut short a
foreign trip and revived concerns about his ability to govern.
	   Yeltsin will spend the day at his Gorky-9 country residence just
outside Moscow, said his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, according to
Russian news agencies. He refused to comment on Yeltsin's
condition.
	   Doctors insisted Monday that Yeltsin fly home from Central Asia
a day ahead of schedule because he was suffering from an upper
respiratory infection and had a mild fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3
F).
	   They said Yeltsin was being treated with antibiotics and there
were no plans to hospitalize him.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has a history of health problems, including
quintuple heart bypass surgery two years ago, so whenever he gets
sick there is a flurry of speculation about his ability to
function.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no major illness and plans to serve out
the remaining two years of his term.
	   But the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper said in a front-page
editorial Tuesday that Yeltsin's condition suggests he is suffering
from something worse than a cold.
	   It said his absence from the Kremlin during the current economic
crisis ``amounts to a state catastrophe'' and called on Yeltsin to
immediately surrender most of his powers to Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   Other newspapers gave a detailed description of Yeltsin's
weaknesses and his erratic behavior on the trip to the former
Soviet republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakstan _ his first foray
abroad since a visit to Britain in May.
	   The president appeared stiff and stumbled when he arrived Sunday
in Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent. He had to be supported by
Uzbek President Islam Karimov and canceled his other public events.
	   At a state dinner on Sunday, Yeltsin made rambling remarks,
expressing his satisfaction with local ``facilities and stores'' he
never inspected, the daily Kommersant reported.
	   On Monday, ``the president didn't seem to understand that he
wasn't in Moscow,'' Kommersant said, saying he called aides and
spoke as though they were late for work at the Kremlin.
	   He turned up more than an hour late for talks with Uzbek
officials, making some incoherent remarks interrupted by a bad
cough and abruptly cutting short a scheduled news conference.
	   Shortly after Yeltsin arrived in neighboring Kazakstan, his
aides announced he would be heading home Monday night instead of
Tuesday, as originally scheduled.
	   Yeltsin's daughter Tatiana Dyachenko, who is his official image
adviser, said the president's ailment wasn't serious. ``Don't
panic, the Dad is OK,'' she said, according to Kommersant.

Russia to reply to Japan's territorial proposals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will respond to Japan's proposals on the
disputed Kuril Islands when Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
visits Moscow next month, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   The dispute over four islands in the Kuril chain, seized by the
Soviet Union at the end of World War II, has prevented the two
countries from signing a peace treaty.
	   Former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made new
proposals for ending the dispute when he and Yeltsin met in Japan
in April.
	   They have not been made public, but Japanese media say Tokyo
proposes taking over the islands legally, but allowing Russian to
retain control for some time.
	   Foreign Ministry official Alexander Losyukov said Russia will
respond during Obuchi's visit in November.
	   ``We have an understanding how this should be done,'' he said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``Work is now in progress
on wording.''

Lawyers contest refusal of bail to Malaysian dissident
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Anwar's lawyers appeal, quotes from visiting
English lawyers. MohyEddeen in 11th graf is cq. ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers for arrested dissident
leader Anwar Ibrahim filed an appeal Tuesday challenging a court's
refusal of bail, as Malaysia told foreign nations not to interfere
with Anwar's forthcoming trial.
	   No date has been fixed for hearing the appeal. A High Court
judge had refused bail when Anwar, the former deputy prime
minister, was arraigned Oct. 5 on 10 counts of corruption and
illegal homosexual acts. Anwar pleaded innocent to all charges.
	   Meanwhile, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi described
as ``unacceptable'' what he called attempts by foreign nations to
interfere in Anwar's trial, which has been set for Nov. 2,
newspapers said.
	   ``This is one example of interference we cannot accept,''
Abdullah said in comments to local reporters Monday evening.
	   He was referring to a report that a man claiming to be a U.S.
senator had made a phone call last week to Justice Augustine Paul,
the High Court judge conducting Anwar's trial, the newspaper New
Straits Times said.
	   The caller told the judge that justice must be seen to be done,
the daily said, and the judge reported the call to police.
	   Such a call is ``tantamount to interference as though we do not
understand the law and are unable to enforce the law well,''
Abdullah said.
	   No other details were available about the reported phone call.
	   Malaysia has repeated assurances that Anwar, who challenged
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year reign, will be given a
fair trial.
	   However, a group of British lawyers, representing Justice
International, a human rights group, said they will watch the trial
to check whether it is fair.
	   ``We feel that if there is to be a fair and open trial in the
case of Anwar, the presence of observers at the trial is
imperative,'' said Sayyad MohyEddeen, a London-based lawyer in the
group.
	   ``We have informed the chief justice and the attorney general of
our intention to participate at the forthcoming trial as
observers,'' he said.
	   Anwar, a former heir-apparent to Mahathir, was fired Sept. 2,
accused of being morally unfit to lead. The two had differed over
economic policy, and Anwar has said Mahathir feared the deputy was
a threat to his office.
	   Anwar was arrested on Sept. 20 and brought to a court nine days
later, badly bruised and with a black eye. He said police had
beaten him until he fell unconscious on his first night of
captivity.
	   His lawyers have repeatedly complained that they were being
harassed by police and even interrogated about their role as
defense attorneys. Until last week, lawyers were denied access to
Anwar, who is locked in a cell at Kuala Lumpur's police
headquarters.
	   The Coalition for People's Democracy, an umbrella organization
of four opposition parties and 14 volunteer groups, urged
Malaysians Tuesday to wear white ribbons every day to show their
longing for justice.
	   ``It's small ribbon but it sends a powerful message,'' said the
chairman of the coalition, Tian Chua, holding aloft the three-inch
(7.6-centimeter) ribbon with an attached pin.
	   ``This shows that the people of Malaysia have not been
frightened by the culture of tyranny and oppression imposed by Dr.
Mahathir's government,'' he said, adding that the ribbons would be
handed out nationwide.

Suzuki to open car and motorcycle plant in Myanmar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp. said Tuesday it will set
up a joint venture in Yangon, Myanmar, to begin producing cars and
motorcycles next spring.
	   Suzuki's president, Osamu Suzuki, signed an agreement with the
government of Myanmar to begin construction of a factory by the end
of the year, the world's third-largest motorcycle maker said in a
statement.
	   Suzuki will invest dlrs 10 million in the new company, which
will eventually produce about 20,000 motorcycles and 3,000 small
cars per year.
	   Suzuki will run the plant jointly with the government-run
Myanmar Automobile and Diesel Engine Industries, the statement
said.
	   A Suzuki executive will be sent to act as president of the joint
venture, to be called Myanmar Suzuki Motor Co.

Earthquake shakes central Serbia; no injuries reported
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An earthquake measuring 3.8 on the
Richter scale shook central Serbia early Tuesday, causing some
panic but no reports of injuries or damage.
	   The quake occurred at about 12:30 a.m. (2230 GMT Monday) and was
centered about 85 kilometers (55 miles) south of Belgrade,
seismologists in the capital said.
	   People near the epicenter in the towns of Valjevo, Cacak and
Mount Maljen rushed out into the streets where they spent most of
the night, reports from the region said.
	   The tremor was also felt in the Yugoslav capital.
	   A larger quake measuring 5.7 on the Richter scale shook the same
region on Sept. 30, prompting initial fears that NATO was following
through on threats to bomb Yugoslavia for its crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.

Russia to send parliamentary delegation to Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian parliament voted Tuesday to send a
fact-finding delegation of lawmakers to the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   The delegation will be led by deputy speaker Sergei Baburin and
include representatives of the major factions in the State Duma
lower house of parliament, it said, quoting ultranationalist leader
Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
	   It gave no other details.
	   Russia opposes possible NATO airstrikes against Serbia, which
makes up most of present-day Yugoslavia. Russia and Serbia are
traditional allies, both being Slavic countries that practice the
Orthodox religion.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Monday that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic had agreed to the stationing of 1,500
observers in Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians are seeking autonomy.
	   He said Russia would consider taking part and could provide
military observation planes, the Interfax news agency said.
	   NATO airstrikes would ``carry us to the red line that, from our
point of view, shouldn't be crossed, because it could entail the
most serious consequences,'' Ivanov told ORT television.

Train carrying weapons from Iran lacked permits: Kyrgyz officials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Iran lacked permission to send a train carrying
weapons through Kyrgyzstan, the foreign minister of the Central
Asian country said Tuesday.
	   Customs officials stopped the train in the southern Kyrgyz town
of Osh on Saturday and found weapons and explosives hidden in a
shipment marked humanitarian aid.
	   Kyrgyz officials allege the weapons were to be loaded onto
trucks and driven to Afghanistan where they would be delivered to
Ahmadshah Masud, a leader of the anti-Taliban alliance, the
Interfax news agency said.
	   The weapons included anti-tank mines, grenades, ammunition for
large-caliber machine guns, mines, shells for 122mm-artillery guns
and Grad rocket launchers, Interfax said.
	   Kyrgyzstan did not give Iran permission to transport the weapons
on its territory, Foreign Minister Murat Ismanaliev told a news
conference.
	   He said Iran sought permission to ship humanitarian aid through
Kyrgyzstan, but that Kyrgyz officials had yet to decide. Iran then
sent the train without warning, he said, according to Interfax.
	   Kyrgyzstan and other former Soviet republics in Central Asia
fear an influx of refugees and weapons from Afghanistan, and
possibly a spill over of fighting that has wracked the country.

Agency to drug test athletes in pre-2000 events
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Sports Drug Agency
(ASDA) is facing a potential showdown with international sports'
federations after saying it will drug test athletes in Olympic
leadup events.
	   ASDA chairman Peter Baume on Tuesday also called on the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ``stand back'' and help
create an independent international drug testing authority.
	   Baume, who announced he will retire from the post in February
1999, said athletes traveling to Australia for warmup competitions
would receive no favors.
	   ``We are bound by legislation and that legislation will apply in
the lead up to the Sydney Olympics,'' he told a science and
medicine in sport conference in Adelaide on Tuesday.
	   Baume said there had already been embarrassment when approaches
were made to test visitors.
	   ``We've had great difficulties already, but we have no option
but to enforce the law as it stands,'' he said.
	   ``We have no degrees of freedom. They are aware that Australia
represents quite a level playing field, we do not want elite
athletes using drugs.
	   ``He or she will be subject to the same rules of testing as
Australian athletes.'' (djp)

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Warning of the risks of global recession,
participants in the private East Asia Economic Summit adopted an
action plan Tuesday for economic growth and reform of the world
financial system.
	   The meeting of economists, businessmen and government officials
urged the West to make significant cuts in interest rates and urged
Japan to expand its money supply.
	   The plan also calls on members of the Group of Seven major
industrial nations to establish a new regime for the monitoring,
disclosure and regulation of highly leveraged short-term financial
flows, as well as off-balance-sheet commitments and derivative
transactions.
	   Participants at the summit organized by the World Economic
Forum, a private agency based in Switzerland, said they were
``deeply concerned about the drift of the world economy and
financial markets, and the growing risk of global recession.''
	   The plan was put together by forum officials in consultation
with speakers at the conference and other participants, and
incorporates many of the themes brought up during the first two
days of the conference, a spokeswoman said.
	   ``Japan, as Asia's major high-income economy, with a GNP twice
as large as all of the rest of Asia combined, has a special
responsibility to help the region emerge from its current deep
recession,'' they said in a statement.
	   Expressing their support for Japan's plan to provide dlrs 30
billion in assistance to crisis-stricken East Asia, the
participants said Japan should be prepared to increase that sum,
``perhaps significantly.''
	   Europe, Canada and the United States should adopt significant
tax cuts, and expand the provision of official loans and credit
guarantees to the emerging markets in crisis, especially to cover
necessities like food, energy and medical supplies, they added.
	   The plan also called on East Asian countries to remain committed
to further openness to foreign direct investment, and work to
achieve greater transparency in conducting business.
	   Many at the gloomy conference have complained of a lack of
leadership in dealing with economic crisis, and of slow recovery,
delayed by political instability.
	   ``In a severe crisis, countries, like individuals, become
preoccupied with survival and become more self-centered and
selfish,'' George Yeo, Singapore's second minister for trade and
industry, told the meeting.
	   ``What we are seeing now is a financial El Nino sweeping the
world,'' Yeo said. ``The crux of the problem is no longer economic,
but political, and because of that it will take a long time to
recover.''
	   Thailand's deputy prime minister, Supachai Panitchpakdi, said
the protectionist trend, coupled with a contraction of export
markets as economies slow down worldwide, could hamstring the Asian
recovery.
	   ``I'm deeply worried about expanding export subsidies. I'm also
worried about anti-dumping duties being applied more than in the
past,'' Supachai said, adding that the ``culprits'' were mostly
Asian countries targeting their struggling neighbors.
	   Supachai also lamented the high cost of borrowing fresh capital
to create jobs and spur sluggish economies. He called the current
rates ``capital punishment.''
	   ``There may be some rationale,'' he said, ``but it's not the
kind of rationale that would prevent the world from going into
recession.''
	   Supachai, who is also commerce minister, had some bad news on
what is still needed to fix Thailand's banking system. He said
non-performing loans could amount to 1.8 trillion baht (dlrs 47
billion), ``an exorbitant level ... which is six times the amount
of capital the government is putting into the banking system.''
	   Almost everyone agrees on the restructuring that the crisis-hit
Asian nations need to save themselves and stem the contagion, said
Hubert Neiss, the International Monetary Fund's Asia-Pacific
director.
	   But the dilemma is that the policy changes require strong
political courage at a time when the economic changes themselves
cause people to doubt their governments.
	   Balance sheets must be cleared of bad loans, insolvent banks
closed, weak ones recapitalized, fiscal policy refocused on
projects that encourage investment and create jobs, and social
safety nets erected in Asian countries that did not have them
before, Neiss said.
	   ``This shift in fiscal policy has resulted in substantial
deficits in most'' of the crisis-hit countries, he said. ``These
restructurings ... are very difficult to implement and are
politically charged.''

Israel lifts curfew in Hebron, eases blockade of Palestinian areas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with details about Gaza border opening &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Israel on Tuesday eased a closure of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip that had kept tens of thousands of
Palestinians from their jobs in Israel for most of the past three
weeks.
	   Hours before sunrise Tuesday, Palestinian workers crossed
briskly through the blockades at the Erez checkpoint between Gaza
and Israel as Palestinian police and Israeli border guards flanked
each side of the barrier.
	   In the West Bank town of Hebron, Israeli troops lifted a curfew
that had confined 30,000 Palestinians to their homes for the past
13 days. The curfew had been imposed after two hand grenades were
thrown at Israeli troops in the Israeli-controlled sector of the
divided city, injuring two dozen Israelis and Palestinians.
	   Israel had sealed its border with the West Bank and Gaza on
Sept. 20, just before the start of the Jewish holidays, which began
with the New Year, followed by Yom Kippur and Sukkot, or the Feast
of the Tabernacles. Sukkot ended on Monday.
	   During the past three weeks, the closure was eased from time to
time, but security officials remained on high alert following
warnings by the Islamic militant group Hamas that it would carry
out a major suicide bomb attack or kidnap Israeli soldiers. Hamas
is seeking revenge for the killing of two of its leaders by Israeli
special forces.
	   Hamas has carried out more than a dozen suicide bombings in
Israel since 1994, killing scores of Israelis.
	   The Israeli closures cause extensive economic hardship in the
Palestinian areas, where unemployment is high. About 60,000
Palestinians have permits to work in Israel. Palestinian leaders
have condemned the closures as collective punishment.

Mahathir's office says Indonesia visit never planned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
office denied Tuesday that a scheduled visit to Indonesia in
November had been canceled, saying no trip ever had been planned.
	   The Indonesia Forum circulated a statement Monday that Mahathir
had canceled his visit because of domestic political developments.
An aide said an invitation from the forum had been received many
months ago, but Mahathir had no plans to go.
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, who had expressed concern at
the arrest of ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, recently
announced his decision not to visit Malaysia later this month
because of domestic pressures.
	   Anwar was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 and arrested 18 days
later. He showed up in court badly bruised, alleging police
brutality.
	   The Indonesia Forum, scheduled Nov. 19-20, is a gathering of
international and regional leaders.

Congolese rebels control Kindu town and air base
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINDU, Congo (AP) _ Victorious Congolese rebels patrolled this
town on the Congo River Tuesday after defeating 5,000 government
troops in an eight-day battle that could determine the direction of
their two-month rebellion.
	   Thousands of exhausted but triumphant rebel troops carrying
Kalashnikov rifles, mortars and rocket-launchers lounged on both
banks of the wide, muddy river that runs through Kindu.
	   ``The enemy has retreated. We're in control,'' said Maj. Siatilo
Ngizo who commanded the assault Sunday on Kindu.
	   The rebels, supported by troops and weapons from neighboring
Rwanda, said Kindu air base, 4 kilometers (2 miles) from the town,
was under their control and would open for rebel resupply flights
later Tuesday.
	   Like most other towns recently captured by the rebels, Kindu was
nearly empty. Most of the inhabitants fled to the sourrounding
forests. Ngizo said some had already started to return.
	   Ngizo said the main government defenses fell Sunday after eight
days of rebel shelling when his troops cornered three Congolese
government batallions on the eastern side of the river.
	   He said there were many casualties on both sides.
	   Among the 1,337 prisoners taken by the rebels were Sudanese,
Chadian and Angolan troops, he said.
	   President Laurent Kabila had turned Kindu into a launching pad
for a counter-offensive against rebel eastern strongholds.
	   The rebel victory will open routes to the diamond-rich province
of Eastern Kasai and its capital, Mbuji-Mayi, as well as to
southern, mineral-rich Katanga Province, Kabila's home.
	   ``This is a big victory for us,'' Arthur Mulunda, another rebel
commander, said. ``Kabila wanted to use Kindu for a big
counter-offensive. He cannot do anything now. Mbuji-Mayi is next.''
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's
army and opposition politicians _ have been reinforced with troops
and weapons from neighboring Rwanda.
	   Kabila has so far refused to negotiate with the rebels, accusing
them of being the puppets of Rwanda and neighboring Uganda.
	   Both countries say they have legitimate security interests in
eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the border area
of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
	   Intevention in mid-August by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and
Namibia stopped a rebel blitzkrieg from the west at the outskirts
of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   Since then, the rebels had been contained in their eastern
strongholds, including the city of Kisangani in north-central
Congo.
	   Rebel fighters shot down a Boeing 727 airplane Saturday and
claimed it was preparing to land in Kindu with 40 government troops
and ammunition.
	   Congo Airlines, which owned the aircraft, said the victims were
civilians fleeing fighting in Kindu. There was no independent
confirmation.
	   Since Saturday, rebels said they had cut off all routes out of
Kindu except one leading southwest and had shelled the town and the
air base daily.

Russian parliament voting to send lawmakers to Kosovo on
fact-finding mission &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Armed with a NATO order moving the
alliance closer to airstrikes, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke renewed
the push for peace Tuesday in new talks with Slobodan Milosevic on
Kosovo.
	   Talks resumed just hours after NATO set a four-day deadline for
the Yugoslav president to back up a new promise to end his
crackdown against ethnic Albanians and cooperate in efforts to
restore normalcy to the southern Serbian province.
	   The 16-nation alliance took the decision after Holbrooke flew to
NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, to brief ambassadors on his
talks with Milosevic.
	   Milosevic remained publicly silent on his reported concessions.
But U.S. President Bill Clinton announced he had agreed to withdraw
his forces from the province, initiate autonomy negotiations with
the separatist ethnic Albanians and allow a force of as many as
2,000 international observers to ensure U.N. demands are met.
	   Nonetheless, he was skeptical about Milosevic's chances of doing
enough by Friday's deadline to avoid airstrikes.
	   ``Commitments are not compliance,'' Clinton said in New York.
``Balkan graveyards are filled with President Milosevic's broken
promises.''
	   A Clinton administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said divisions remained over the issue of how to verify
Yugoslav compliance with U.N. demands. He refused to elaborate.
	   Holbrooke said after returning early Tuesday from Brussels that
the recent discussions ``have created some promising
possibilities.''
	   ``As President Clinton said in his public statement, these
discussions have resulted in some opportunities for significant
steps on the path towards peace and away from the danger of war,''
he said.
	   Despite signs of diplomatic progress, Western nations have been
scaling down their embassy staffs in Belgrade in case diplomacy
fails and force must be used. The international diplomats' mission
observing events evacuated Kosovo on Monday for neighboring
Macedonia. The last to leave were the Russians, loyal Serb allies.
	   On Tuesday, the Russian parliament voted to send a fact-finding
delegation of lawmakers to Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke touted the agreement on the observer force, to be
overseen by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, as particularly significant.
	   In the Kosovo capital of Pristina, a senior ethnic Albanian
leader, Fehmi Agani, said an observer force ``could prove useful
and provide a way out of the Kosovo crisis without further war.''
Agani is head of the ethnic Albanian team set up to negotiate with
Belgrade authorities.
	   As Holbrooke was returning to Belgrade, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana announced the alliance had issued an ``activation
order'' placing military resources on a war footing. But the order
does not take effect for 96 hours to allow Holbrooke time to
finalize an agreement.
	   ``We have to maintain this pressure,'' Solana told a news
conference.
	   Solana said the order formally places warplanes and other
military hardware under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander
Wesley K. Clark. He said order was for both ``limited air strikes
and a phased air campaign'' against Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic launched the crackdown Feb. 28 against the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is battling for independence for Kosovo,
whose 2 million-strong population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and the Europeans oppose the KLA's goal of
independence, fearing it would fuel calls for a ``Greater Albania''
uniting ethnic Albanian communities in other countries of the
southern Balkans.
	   Although the KLA has opposed a negotiated settlement short of
full independence, the guerrillas have been beaten by the Serbs on
the battlefield in recent fighting.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Armed with a NATO order moving the
alliance closer to airstrikes, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke renewed
the push for peace Tuesday in new talks with Slobodan Milosevic on
Kosovo.
	   Talks resumed just hours after NATO set a four-day deadline for
the Yugoslav president to back up a new promise to end his
crackdown against ethnic Albanians and cooperate in efforts to
restore normalcy to the southern Serbian province.
	   The 16-nation alliance took the decision after Holbrooke flew to
NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, to brief ambassadors on his
talks with Milosevic.
	   Milosevic remained publicly silent on his reported concessions.
But U.S. President Bill Clinton announced he had agreed to withdraw
his forces from the province, initiate autonomy negotiations with
the separatist ethnic Albanians and allow a force of as many as
2,000 international observers to ensure U.N. demands are met.
	   Nonetheless, he was skeptical about Milosevic's chances of doing
enough by Friday's deadline to avoid airstrikes.
	   ``Commitments are not compliance,'' Clinton said in New York.
``Balkan graveyards are filled with President Milosevic's broken
promises.''
	   A Clinton administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said divisions remained over the issue of how to verify
Yugoslav compliance with U.N. demands. He refused to elaborate.
	   Holbrooke said after returning early Tuesday from Brussels that
the recent discussions ``have created some promising
possibilities.''
	   ``As President Clinton said in his public statement, these
discussions have resulted in some opportunities for significant
steps on the path towards peace and away from the danger of war,''
he said.
	   Despite signs of diplomatic progress, Western nations have been
scaling down their embassy staffs in Belgrade in case diplomacy
fails and force must be used. The international diplomats' mission
observing events evacuated Kosovo on Monday for neighboring
Macedonia. The last to leave were the Russians, loyal Serb allies.
	   On Tuesday, the Russian parliament voted to send a fact-finding
delegation of lawmakers to Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke touted the agreement on the observer force, to be
overseen by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, as particularly significant.
	   In the Kosovo capital of Pristina, a senior ethnic Albanian
leader, Fehmi Agani, said an observer force ``could prove useful
and provide a way out of the Kosovo crisis without further war.''
Agani is head of the ethnic Albanian team set up to negotiate with
Belgrade authorities.
	   As Holbrooke was returning to Belgrade, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana announced the alliance had issued an ``activation
order'' placing military resources on a war footing. But the order
does not take effect for 96 hours to allow Holbrooke time to
finalize an agreement.
	   ``We have to maintain this pressure,'' Solana told a news
conference.
	   Solana said the order formally places warplanes and other
military hardware under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander
Wesley K. Clark. He said order was for both ``limited air strikes
and a phased air campaign'' against Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic launched the crackdown Feb. 28 against the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is battling for independence for Kosovo,
whose 2 million-strong population is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The United States and the Europeans oppose the KLA's goal of
independence, fearing it would fuel calls for a ``Greater Albania''
uniting ethnic Albanian communities in other countries of the
southern Balkans.
	   Although the KLA has opposed a negotiated settlement short of
full independence, the guerrillas have been beaten by the Serbs on
the battlefield in recent fighting.

Philippine Supreme Court removes last major obstacle to first
</HEADLINE>
execution &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that
lethal injections are a constitutional method of carrying out the
death penalty.
	   The ruling cleared one obstacle to the Philippines' first
execution in two decades, but new delays were imposed when the
court invalidated two provisions of the government's execution
rules.
	   It was ruling on the case of Leo Echegaray, a poor house painter
convicted of raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter.
	   Echegaray was the first scheduled to die among more than 700
death row inmates under a law that restored capital punishment in
the Philippines in 1994.
	   ``We consider this a victory in the sense that we were able to
stop the execution temporarily,'' said Maria Socorro Diokno of the
Free Legal Assistance Group, which provides legal counsel to
Echegaray.
	   Diokno said the group would appeal the lethal injection ruling.
	   The constitution approved in 1987 abolished the death penalty,
but gave Congress the option to restore it for crimes such as
murder, kidnappings for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Legislators did so in 1994, providing for executions by electric
chair and gassing. Two years later, the law was changed to make
lethal injections the only method of execution.
	   Last year, the Supreme Court upheld Echegaray's conviction and
approved his execution this year, but the court later delayed it to
consider his appeal on the constitutionality of lethal injections.
	   Echegaray's lawyers contended lethal injection was
unconstitutionally cruel because it could be very painful for any
inmate if the lethal drugs are improperly administered.
	   A majority of the court's 15 justices held that the infliction
of pain in a lethal injection is incidental during executions ``and
does not fall within the constitutional proscription against cruel,
degrading or inhuman punishment.''
	   ``The few minutes of pain does not rise to a constitutional
violation,'' the court said.
	   The tribunal, however, invalidated two minor provisions in the
government's execution rules and prevented the government from
executing Echegaray until these are ``appropriately amended,
revised or corrected.''
	   One provision prevents a death convict and the public from
obtaining copies of the execution rules. Another suspends for three
years the execution of a woman death convict from the day she is
sentenced.
	   The Supreme Court, which automatically reviews all death
sentences, has so far upheld 21.
	   Echegaray was convicted of raping his stepdaughter five times in
1994, the first time while her mother was gambling in a house next
door. The family was so poor that the children sold cigarettes on
the street.
	   Philippine Roman Catholic Church leaders and other civic groups
oppose the death penalty, arguing there is no concrete proof that
it could deter crime. The poor would be disadvantaged because they
couldn't afford good lawyers for their defense, opponents say.
	   Proponents say the death penalty has not served as a deterrent
to crime because so far nobody has been executed under the new law.
	   President Joseph Estrada has said he would not pardon Echegaray.

Dutch close embassy in Belgrade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Netherlands has closed its
embassy in Belgrade and withdrawn all staff, a precautionary
measure ahead of possible NATO airstrikes.
	   The embassy was shuttered late Tuesday, the Foreign Ministry
said, and the ambassador was pulled out. In doing so, the Dutch
followed the British, German and French, all of whom have closed
their embassies in the Yugoslav capital.
	   The closing came as a Dutch polling institute released a survey
indicating support for airstrikes in Yugoslavia as an attempt to
avert more bloodshed in Kosovo.
	   Forty-seven percent of those surveyed said they supported
strikes, according to the poll by the NIPO agency. Twenty-three
percent said they were opposed to the use of force; 30 percent said
they were undecided. No margin of error was given.

League for Democratic Kosovo, the ethnic Albanians' main political
party.
	   ``But we have a very bitter experience with this regime, so we
have to wait and see,'' he said. ``Until now, they say one thing
and do another.''
	   A Serb regional governor in Kosovo, Veljko Odalovic, said;
``NATO and the international community are knocking on an open
door. We are employing our utmost efforts to normalize
conditions.''

Dollar rose, Tokyo stocks end lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with BOJ announcement, late dollar, bond, comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen Tuesday on
expectations that the Japanese central bank would ease credit, but
eased somewhat when the bank took no action. Japanese stocks fell
on profit-taking.
	   The dollar bought 118.38 yen in late afternoon, up 1.66 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
117.63 yen overnight. The currency ranged between 117.45 yen and
119.60 yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 312.22 points, or 2.30
percent, closing at 13,242.79. On Monday, the Nikkei had surged
675.04 points, or 5.24 percent.
	   The dollar slipped more than one yen from its highs when the
Bank of Japan said it was leaving monetary policy unchanged.
	   ``There was a feeling that there would be an easing, but it
didn't happen, so the dollar was sold,'' said Ryohei Muramatsu,
treasury manager at Commerzbank.
	   The market's focus shifted to any indications of easing by the
U.S. Federal Reserve, which could push the dollar lower in overseas
trading, Muramatsu said.
	   Last month, the BOJ lowered short-term interest rates in an
attempt to lessen a credit crunch among small companies hurt by
Japan's recession.
	   Lower interest rates tend to make a nation's currency less
attractive to investors.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, share prices fell on profit-taking
after Monday's rally, triggered by the passage of laws that will
allow the government to take over foundering banks to fix them or
shut them down.
	   On Tuesday, Parliament's lower house passed a bill that will
allow the government to help banks boost their capital.
	   Traders are now waiting to see how the government might disburse
public funds to weak but viable banks.
	   Also Tuesday, the Cabinet approved a supplementary budget
proposal that includes 43 trillion yen (dlrs 361 billion) to
stabilize the financial system, with 18 trillion yen (dlrs 151
billion) for the government to purchase shares in banks to be
nationalized temporarily and 25 trillion yen (dlrs 210 billion) to
be pumped into weak but viable banks in need of fresh capital.
	   The extra budget and recapitalization bill are expected to
become law before the current parliamentary session ends Friday.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 24.36, or 2.38 percent, to 998.98. It had
gained 40.84 points, or 4.16 percent, the previous day.
	   Volume on the first section was estimated at 506 million shares,
down from 570.7 million Monday. Retreats outnumbered advances 1,024
to 192, with 84 issues unchanged.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.830 percent from Monday's finish of 0.900 percent,
driving its price up to 108.68 yen from 108.01 yen.

Talks prompt Air Algerie strikers to offer limited services
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Air Algerie personnel, on the eighth day
of a strike, on Tuesday resumed some services while they await the
results of ongoing talks between unions and company officials.
	   Mohammed Khodja, a union spokesman, said 10 international
flights and five national ones would take off Tuesday from Algiers.
It was not known how long the talks would last.
	   On Monday, personnel voted to withdraw a guarantee of minimal
flights after company officials said they would not accept changes
to a restructuring plan.
	   Air Algerie officials say a restructuring is essential to
maintain the company's competitiveness. But staff fear there will
be inevitable job losses.
	   The strike has left thousands of people stranded, and many have
had to take ferries to Europe, or buses and trains to complete
inland journeys.

Russia to expand role of foreign banks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov promised Tuesday
to expand the role of foreign banks in Russia, and said his
government has no plans to nationalize domestic banks, not even
those on the verge of bankruptcy.
	   Primakov also said during a meeting with major Russian banks
that between dlrs 1.5 and dlrs 2 billion has been sent out of the
country, some of it illegally, since the latest economic crisis
struck in mid-August.
	   No details were released of Primakov's plans for foreign banks,
which are currently not allowed to provide retail services in
Russia. All the major international banks have offices in Russia,
devoted mostly to corporate and investment services.
	   ``We cannot manage without expanding opportunities for foreign
banks in Russia, without the expansion of foreign capital in assets
of Russian banks,'' Primakov said, in remarks broadcast on national
television.
	   The Russian media have given varied accounts of how the
government is likely to respond to the banking crisis.
	   Some reports have said the government is considering
nationalizing the country's leading banks, while other reports said
the government will seek only to rescue ailing banks, and will
leave them in private hands.
	   Some commercial banks have failed, and most have frozen accounts
or allow only limited transactions. The banks regularly run out of
rubles and foreign currencies sought by customers.
	   Clients of six major private banks have been advised to transfer
their accounts to the state savings bank, where they would be
guaranteed. Any savings in foreign currencies would, however, be
converted into rubles at an unfavorable rate.
	   The government says it plans to make public its proposals to
overcome the crisis by Oct. 20. However, it acknowledges these will
be mostly stop-gap measures rather than a comprehensive, long-term
plan.
	   The government's fourth-quarter budget will also be made public
next week. Primakov says the budget depends on the International
Monetary Fund releasing frozen installments in a dlrs 22.6 billion
bailout package negotiated before the crisis hit.
	   The IMF says it wants to see details of the government's
economic plan, plus signs it has been implemented, before it will
release more money. An IMF delegation is expected to return to
Moscow next week.

Netanyahu seeks Cabinet backing for agreement with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hardline members of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's Cabinet demanded Tuesday that he not hand over any West
Bank land unless the Palestinians meet a number of conditions, such
as revoking the PLO Covenant.
	   The demands by ministers from the National Religious Party were
delivered in a special Cabinet meeting held a day before Netanyahu
was to leave for a series of meetings with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and U.S. officials in Washington.
	   The NRP is a patron of the Jewish settlement movement in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip and threatens to topple Netanyahu's
coalition over a West Bank pullback. The party has enough seats in
the 120-member parliament to rob Netanyahu of his parliamentary
majority.
	   The NRP wants the Palestinians to extradite suspects in attacks
on Israelis and to cancel clauses in the PLO founding charter that
call for the destruction of Israel, said party spokesman Joshua
Mor-Yosef.
	   In addition, the NRP stipulated that Netanyahu not sign a
withdrawal agreement unless the scope of an additional pullback is
decided on now, Mor-Yosef said.
	   If Netanyahu wraps up a deal without meeting these conditions
the NRP will bring down the government, Mor-Yosef said.
	   Netanyahu has agreed in principle to hand over 13 percent of the
West Bank, with some restrictions. The key issue to be tackled in
Washington is to work out an agreement on what constitutes a good
faith Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   A government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Netanyahu will support the NRP's demands on security and the PLO
Charter, but will not agree to any formal Cabinet decision
restricting his power to negotiate.
	   The Palestinians said many differences remained and that they
were skeptical about Israel's willingness to conclude an agreement.
	   ``He (Netanyahu) declared he is not going to Washington with
maps. What are we negotiating if he is not going with maps?'' said
Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath.
	   The Palestinians have rejected new Israeli security demands,
noting that a three-way understanding on a Palestinian crackdown on
Islamic militants was negotiated last year, but was scrapped by
Netanyahu at the last minute.
	   In the meantime, the Palestinians made new demands of their own,
insisting that Jewish settlers be disarmed.
	   CIA director George Tenet, who has participated in recent the
negotiations on a new security memorandum, failed to bridge the
gaps, Israel radio said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton telephoned Netanyahu and Arafat on
Monday and urged them to make the decisions necessary to achieve an
agreement when they meet Thursday at Wye Plantation, Maryland.
	   Clinton said he would make every effort to conclude the
agreement on the troop withdrawal so that negotiations can begin on
the permanent settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Also Tuesday, Israel eased a closure of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip that had kept tens of thousands of Palestinians from their
jobs in Israel for most of the past three weeks.
	   As part of the easing, 21,000 workers, 8,000 business people and
1,000 medical doctors and nurses were permitted to return to their
jobs.

With economic uncertainty, political pressure, China retreats on

reform &QL;

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ With international financial turmoil
battering its traditional trading partners and threatening its
growth, China is rethinking an ambitious embrace of free-market
reforms launched with great fanfare over the past year.
	   Shaken by the roiling world economy and under pressure from
conservative communists and the newly dispossessed working class,
Chinese leaders have backpedaled on policies to privatize state
industries, delayed plans to encourage home ownership and slowed
measures to overhaul the financial sector.
	   While government policy advisers insist China's 20-year economic
reform effort goes on, the communist leadership, never fully
enamored of capitalism, is said to be drawing comfort from moves by
Malaysia and Russia to seal their economies from what they see as
the excesses of unfettered global markets.
	   China's 344 most influential politicians gathered in Beijing
Monday for a three-day closed-door policy plenum of the Communist
Party Central Committee. In an indication of political strains, the
policy changes are not on the publicly announced agenda.
Agricultural reform is.
	   ``The Communist Party normally does not announce that it has
changed its policies or recognized its mistakes,'' said Pan Wei, an
expert on Chinese politics at elite Peking University.
	   ``When they hold a plenum, there has to be a pronouncement. Some
problems, the ones that are relatively easy to resolve, they'll
talk about. The ones that are hard, even if discussed, won't be
easily resolved,'' Pan said.
	   Premier Zhu Rongji, No. 3 in the party and the leader most
closely associated with the now shaky reforms, began signaling the
retreat in summer speeches. Months of bad economic news showed
Asia's financial torpor was squeezing exports and foreign
investment and dragging down China's growth below the 8 percent
target.
	   Plans to end subsidies for public housing this year and sell
smaller state industries fell to pressure from local officials and
fear of discontent among laid-off state workers, projected to
number 15 million this year by one conservative economist's count.
	   By August, the State Economic and Trade Commission, Zhu's top
economic regulatory body, directed government agencies to be more
careful in shedding smaller state enterprises. That was followed by
steps to limit the outflow of already tightly controlled foreign
exchange, put price floors on automobiles and other glutted goods
made by state companies, and get state banks already teetering from
bad loans to increase lending. A senior U.S. trade official has
warned of a trade war if China locks out foreign investors from
barely open telecommunications and pharmaceuticals markets.
	   Conservatives crowed at the rollback on state enterprises. In a
rare display of agreement with Zhu's policies, the orthodox
communist magazine Quest for Truth called the directive ``on
target.''
	   ``Obviously, this storm to sell off state enterprises was an act
of privatization,'' said one article. ``If continued, it would
threaten the existence of the state-controlled economy, the
position of public ownership, the interests of the working masses
and the foundation of socialism.''
	   Economic threats from abroad have bolstered the influence of
conservative economists who want the Central Committee to make up
for lost foreign investment and exports by endorsing a program to
stimulate domestic demand. Under one plan by Hu Angang, an
economist whose views Zhu is said to favor, imports would remain
strictly limited as long as exports do not recover.
	   News going into the plenum has strengthened their hand. Customs
officials reported that exports dropped 6.7 percent in September
from a year earlier and for the year so far have risen an anemic
3.9 percent, compared with 21 percent for all of 1997.
	   ``What was wrong was the expectations. The central government
was trying to do something in three years. The local governments
were rushing. But the reality is you need a longer time to achieve
reform,'' said Fan Gang, an economist at a think tank run by one of
Zhu's policy research offices.
	   ``The proposals are still there, but now they have to work out
the real problems,'' said Fan.
	   Pan, the political watcher, believes the setbacks are failures
by Zhu and his reformers in marshaling political support, not in
reading the market.
	   ``Zhu Rongji's leadership style is a bit too simplified. China
has become not democratic, but pluralistic. So a simple,
administrative fiat policy can raise a great reaction,'' Pan said.

Russia to send parliamentary delegation to Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian parliament voted Tuesday to send an
urgent fact-finding delegation to the Yugoslav province of Kosovo,
and its speaker urged fellow Slavic neighbors to do the same thing.
	   The four- or five-member delegation will leave as early as
Tuesday night, said Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma
lower house of parliament.
	   ``It would be good if our colleagues, friends and allies,
deputies from Belarus or Ukraine, would also send their people,''
Seleznyov said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia opposes possible NATO airstrikes against Serbia, which
makes up most of present-day Yugoslavia. Russia and Serbia are
allies, both being Slavic countries that practice the Orthodox
religion.
	   Ukraine and Belarus are also Slavic countries. Ukraine has
offered to help mediate a peaceful solution to the crackdown on
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, while Belarus has offered military aid
to Yugoslavia in the event it is targeted by NATO.
	   ``We still insist that NATO properly weigh matters and think
what the consequences of the bombings will be,'' Seleznyov said.
``I do not think they (NATO) have taken into account all the
consequences.''
	   Vladimir Ryzhkov, a lawmaker for the pro-government Our Home is
Russia parliamentary group, said the delegation wants to see for
itself what is happening in Kosovo and assess how negotiations are
going.
	   Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Monday that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic had agreed to the stationing of 1,500
observers in Kosovo. He said Russia would consider taking part and
could provide military observation planes, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   NATO airstrikes would ``carry us to the red line that, from our
point of view, shouldn't be crossed, because it could entail the
most serious consequences,'' Ivanov told ORT television.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Armed with a NATO order moving the
alliance closer to airstrikes, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke renewed
the push for peace Tuesday in new talks with Slobodan Milosevic on
Kosovo.
	   Talks resumed just hours after NATO set a four-day deadline for
the Yugoslav president to back up a new promise to end his
crackdown against ethnic Albanians and cooperate in efforts to
restore normalcy to the southern Serbian province.
	   The two met for just an hour Tuesday morning, and the status of
further talks was not clear. Holbrooke scheduled a news conference
for shortly afterward.
	   The 16-nation alliance took the decision after Holbrooke flew to
NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, to brief ambassadors on his
talks with Milosevic.
	   Milosevic remained publicly silent on his reported concessions.
But U.S. President Bill Clinton announced he had agreed to withdraw
his forces from the province, initiate autonomy negotiations with
the separatist ethnic Albanians and allow a force of as many as
2,000 international observers to ensure U.N. demands are met.
	   Nonetheless, he was skeptical about Milosevic's chances of doing
enough by Friday's deadline to avoid airstrikes.
	   ``Commitments are not compliance,'' Clinton said in New York.
``Balkan graveyards are filled with President Milosevic's broken
promises.''
	   A Clinton administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said divisions remained over the issue of how to verify
Yugoslav compliance with U.N. demands. He refused to elaborate.
	   Holbrooke said after returning early Tuesday from Brussels that
the recent discussions ``have created some promising
possibilities.''
	   ``As President Clinton said in his public statement, these
discussions have resulted in some opportunities for significant
steps on the path towards peace and away from the danger of war,''
he said.
	   Despite signs of diplomatic progress, Western nations have been
scaling down their embassy staffs in Belgrade in case diplomacy
fails and force must be used. The international diplomats' mission
observing events evacuated Kosovo on Monday for neighboring
Macedonia. The last to leave were the Russians, loyal Serb allies.
	   On Tuesday, the Russian parliament voted to send a fact-finding
delegation of lawmakers to Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke touted the agreement on the observer force, to be
overseen by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, as particularly significant.
	   An ethnic Albanian official was positive about the latest
developments.
	   ``We welcome NATO's dedication to stop the genocide and the
human catastrophe,'' said Alush Gashi, foreign secretary of the
League for Democratic Kosovo, the ethnic Albanians' main political
party.
	   ``But we have a very bitter experience with this regime, so we
have to wait and see,'' he said. ``Until now, they say one thing
and do another.''
	   A Serb regional governor in Kosovo, Veljko Odalovic, said;
``NATO and the international community are knocking on an open
door. We are employing our utmost efforts to normalize
conditions.''

Yugoslavia dissatisfied with Romania's decision to let NATO use

airspace &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Yugoslavia's ambassador to Bucharest
criticized neighboring Romania's decision to let NATO use its
airspace in emergency situations if the alliance launches
airstrikes, media reported Tuesday.
	   ``This decision is in contradiction with the Romanian-Yugoslav
bilateral treaty which stipulates that the two parts would not
participate and not support any war operation against each other,''
Ambassador Desimir Jevtic said in an interview with the Adevarul
daily.
	   Jevtic, who said he cannot predict the consequences of such a
decision, asked Romanian authorities to clarify their position and
explain what ``emergency situations'' means.
	   NATO is considering airstrikes to force Yugoslavian President
Slobodan Milosevic to agree to end a crackdown against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo province.
	   Romanian Parliament is expected Wednesday to adopt an official
position after the Supreme Defense Council decided Sunday that the
army would not participate in any NATO military action against
neighboring Yugoslavia.
	   The chief of the Romanian Frontier Guards, Dumitru Luca, said
the guards are already on alert.
	   ``It's more than sure that a possible conflict in Yugoslavia
will generate illegal crossings of the border and even illegal
transports with gasoline from Romania to Yugoslavia,'' he said by
telephone. He said Romania already has a ``sad'' experience of the
1993-95 embargo against Yugoslavia, which was violated several
times.
	   Romania and Yugoslavia have a common border of 550 kilometers
(344 miles) on water and land and Luca said that in case of a
conflict the authorities are expecting numerous refugees.
	   Some Romanian towns already announced they are preparing
shelters for possible homeless people.

Congolese rebels control Kindu town and air base

<TEXT>
	   KINDU, Congo (AP) _ Victorious Congolese rebels patrolled this
town on the Congo River Tuesday after defeating 5,000 government
troops in an eight-day battle that could determine the direction of
their two-month rebellion.
	   Thousands of exhausted but triumphant rebel troops carrying
Kalashnikov rifles, mortars and rocket-launchers lounged on both
banks of the wide, muddy river that runs through Kindu.
	   ``The enemy has retreated. We're in control,'' said Maj. Siatilo
Ngizo who commanded the assault Sunday on Kindu, 380 kilometers
(235 miles) west of the rebel stronghold of Goma on the Rwandan
border.
	   The rebels, supported by troops and weapons from neighboring
Rwanda, said Kindu air base, 4 kilometers (2 miles) from the town,
was under their control and would open for rebel resupply flights
later Tuesday.
	   Like most other towns recently captured by the rebels, Kindu was
nearly empty. Most of the inhabitants fled to the sourrounding
forests. Ngizo said some had already started to return.
	   Ngizo said the main government defenses fell Sunday after eight
days of rebel shelling when his troops cornered three Congolese
government batallions on the eastern side of the river.
	   He said there were many casualties on both sides.
	   Among the 1,337 prisoners taken by the rebels were Sudanese,
Chadian and Angolan troops, he said.
	   President Laurent Kabila had turned Kindu into a launching pad
for a counter-offensive against rebel eastern strongholds.
	   The rebel victory will open routes to the diamond-rich province
of Eastern Kasai and its capital, Mbuji-Mayi, as well as to
southern, mineral-rich Katanga Province, Kabila's home.
	   ``This is a big victory for us,'' Arthur Mulunda, another rebel
commander, said. ``Kabila wanted to use Kindu for a big
counter-offensive. He cannot do anything now. Mbuji-Mayi is next.''
	   Mbuji-Mayi is 440 kilometers (273 miles) southwest of Kindu.
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's
army and opposition politicians _ have been reinforced with troops
and weapons from neighboring Rwanda.
	   Kabila has so far refused to negotiate with the rebels, accusing
them of being the puppets of Rwanda and neighboring Uganda.
	   Both countries say they have legitimate security interests in
eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the border area
of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
	   Intevention in mid-August by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and
Namibia stopped a rebel blitzkrieg from the west at the outskirts
of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   Since then, the rebels had been contained in their eastern
strongholds, including the city of Kisangani in north-central
Congo.
	   Rebel fighters shot down a Boeing 727 airplane Saturday and
claimed it was preparing to land in Kindu with 40 government troops
and ammunition.
	   Congo Airlines, which owned the aircraft, said the victims were
civilians fleeing fighting in Kindu. There was no independent
confirmation.
	   Since Saturday, rebels said they had cut off all routes out of
Kindu except one leading southwest and had shelled the town and the
air base daily.

French victims of Spanish boat tragedy head home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GERONA, Spain (AP) _ Twenty hearses left this northeastern
Spanish city Tuesday, carrying the bodies of the French tourists
killed when a pleasure boat sank in nearby lake last week.
	   Once past the French border, 80 kilometers (50 miles) to the
north, most were to continue northwest towards the area surrounding
the city of Nantes were the majority of the victims lived, the
Spanish undertakers organizing the repatriation said.
	   The hearses left in small groups rather than in one long convoy,
the undertakers said.
	   A half-hour excursion around Lake Banyoles went tragically wrong
last Thursday when an electric-powered catamaran sank soon after
moving away from its moorings killing 20 of the 139 retired French
tourists on board.
	   Three of the survivors remained in hospital in Spain, but the
rest were fit to return to France Friday.
	   The boat was only designed to carry 80 passengers, and initial
investigations indicated that overcrowding and modifications to the
vessel's ventilation ducts had caused the accident.
	   The two owners of the boat, one of whom was at the helm at the
time of the accident, were charged with manslaughter on Saturday.
They were given until Tuesday night to post bail set at five
million pesetas (dlrs 34,000).

British group to monitor Anwar trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A team of international human
rights lawyers said Tuesday they planned to monitor the trial of
Malaysia's jailed dissident leader to ensure it was fair.
	   Sayaad MohyEddeen, director of Justice International Commission
on Human Rights, said the case of ousted deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim was of ``grave concern'' to the international legal
community.
	   MohyEddeen was one of two British lawyers who arrived in
Malaysia Saturday to meet with Anwar's defense team and his family
to offer assistance ``in any way we can.''
	   ``Our help involves seeing that rule of law is observed, that
the defense lawyers of Anwar are not unduly restricted and are
given normal rights to prepare and defend him freely without
hindrance,'' he said.
	   MohyEddeen said the commission did not plan to aid the defense
during the trial that begins Nov. 2.
	   The group had informed the High Court chief justice and attorney
general of its intention to monitor the trial. It has also sought
permission to meet Anwar.
	   ``The presence of observers at the trial is imperative,'' said
MohyEddeen, who was accompanied by the group's chairman, John
Platts-Mills.
	   Anwar's lawyers have complained that access to their client was
being restricted by police.
	   Anwar, fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept. 2, was
arrested Sept. 20 under the harsh Internal Security Act. He is
charged with corruption and sexual misconduct.
	   International concern increased after Anwar appeared in court
badly bruised.
	   The two lawyers plan to leave Malaysia Wednesday and report
their findings to the Bar Council of England.

Moldovan to miss Romania's qualifier in Hungary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's striker Viorel Moldovan will
miss Wednesday's qualifier in Hungary, the soccer federation said
Tuesday.
	   The statement, quoting team doctor Pompiliu Popescu, said
Moldovan ruptured a thigh muscle in his right leg on Saturday
during a 1-0 victory over Portugal.
	   Moldovan, who plays for the Turkish club Fenerbahce, will
probably be replaced with rising star Adrian Mutu, who plays for FC
Arges and Romania's under-21 soccer team.
	   Three other key players will miss the match in Budapest.
Strikers Adrian Ilie of Valencia and Radu Niculescu of Rapid
Bucharest are being treated for leg injuries. Both missed the
Portugal match, in which striker Laurentiu Rosu was sent off and

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese authorities on Tuesday raided the offices
of Mita Industrial Co., a failed maker of copy machines, on
suspicion it illegally paid dividends to shareholders to hide its
financial difficulties, a police official said.
	   A police official in the city of Osaka, speaking on condition of
anonymity, confirmed that a joint raid was conducted by police and
prosecutors but refused to provide other details.
	   Japanese news media said authorities were searching more than 10
locations, including Mita's head office in Osaka and the homes of
former company executives.
	   Mita is suspected of violating the commercial code by having
paid out some 37 billion yen (dlrs 316 million) in dividends over
the last 10 years to hide from shareholders that it was in the red,
news reports said.
	   With Japan's five-year statute of limitations, only about a
third of that sum could actually be cited in any charges filed.
	   Prosecutors are also considering breach of trust charges against
former Mita executives who received allowances totaling 272 billion
yen (dlrs 2.32 million) over the period, Kyodo News said.
	   Mita collapsed in August with about 200 billion yen (dlrs 1.7
billion) in liabilities in one of the largest failures in Japan
since World War II.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ An investment trust management unit of Japan's
Nippon Life Insurance Co. and U.S.-based Putnam Investments
confirmed Tuesday they will strengthen an alliance formed in 1997
by developing an investment trust product line.
	   Nissay Asset Management Corp. and Putnam will develop the joint
product line and strengthen sales training and distribution
capabilities in the investment trust management market, they said.
	   Putnam has also pledged to take a 10 percent capital position in
Nissay Asset.
	   Putnam and Nissay Asset will prepare for a joint entry into the
Japanese market for defined contribution retirement savings
programs resembling U.S. 401(k) accounts, the two companies said.
	   Putnam and Nissay Asset formed a strategic alliance in 1997,
under which the companies have developed and marketed products for
institutional investors.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp. said Tuesday it will set
up a joint venture in Yangon, Myanmar, to begin producing cars and
motorcycles next spring.
	   Suzuki's president, Osamu Suzuki, signed an agreement with the
government of Myanmar to begin construction of a factory by the end
of the year, the world's third-largest motorcycle maker said in a
statement.
	   Suzuki will invest dlrs 10 million in the new company, which
will eventually produce about 20,000 motorcycles and 3,000 small
cars per year.
	   Suzuki will run the plant jointly with the government-run
Myanmar Automobile and Diesel Engine Industries, the statement
said.
	   A Suzuki executive will be sent to act as president of the joint
venture, to be called Myanmar Suzuki Motor Co.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The Hyundai business group sent 83
construction workers and equipment to North Korea Tuesday to build
port facilities for its proposed sightseeing tours.
	   A ship carrying the workers left South Korea's Donghae port for
Changjon, a port on North Korea's east coast. Eight barges loaded
with construction equipment followed.
	   The workers and 350 others to follow in the next month will
build berthing facilities at Changjon to be used by Hyundai ships
carrying tourists to nearby Diamond Mountain.
	   The workers also will build rest centers, restaurants and other
tourism-related facilities on and around the mountain, a major
tourist attraction.
	   Hyundai's founder and honorary chairman Chung Ju-yung visited
his native North Korea in June with a gift of 500 cattle and agreed
to start sightseeing tours of the mountain as a joint venture.
	   Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate, hopes to send up to
2,000 tourists a week on two luxury cruise ships for tours of the
mountain, starting later this month.
	   Meanwhile, North Korea said in a letter to Hyundai Tuesday that
it would consider accepting a Seoul government proposal to launch a
joint probe of the death of 71 cattle donated by Hyundai.
	   The North earlier accused the Seoul government of plotting to
kill the cattle by feeding them indigestible vinyl strips and lumps
of hemp rope before shipping them to the North.
	   South Korea rejected the accusation and suggested that
veterinarians and officials of North and South Korea jointly
investigate the deaths.

	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ The global economic environment
appears to be moving towards deflation and News Corp. was bracing
for a significant downturn in world markets, media magnate Rupert
Murdoch said Tuesday.
	   Addressing the annual general meeting of his News Corp. Ltd.,
company chief executive Murdoch said there had been substantial
shocks to the world's financial systems and there may be more to
come in the next few months.
	   ``We seem to be moving to a period of deflation,'' he told
shareholders.
	   Asked by reporters after the meeting if he believed the world
could slip into recession, Murdoch said: ``Everyone is worried
about the possibility of it.''
	   Murdoch questioned the ability of governments protect their
economies from market movements.
	   ``Around the world the big question is just how much governments
will be able to do, as against how much central bankers will be
able to do or how much markets will just go past all those
forces,'' he said.
	   ``We are in a new paradigm altogether and government's can maybe
soften the effects of violent movement in the markets, but not much
else.''
	   Murdoch said News Corp. was not planning any significant
acquisitions as it braces for a significant downturn in world
markets, and that the company would remain cashed up amid the
market volatility.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Exports from Southeast Asian countries have
slowed since the start of the region's financial crisis,
confounding hopes that their currency devaluations would allow them
to export their way out of the turmoil, officials said Tuesday.
	   ``It's been more than a year since the devaluations,'' said
Rodolfo Severino, secretary general of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations. ``There has been no export response from the ASEAN
countries. Quite the contrary.''
	   Normally, a lower exchange rate would make a nation's products
more competitive overseas. Many economists had predicted that the
sharp currency devaluations that resulted from the crisis, which
hit in July 1997, would create an export surge as the countries
attempted to recover economically.
	   But Severino and other officials attending an East Asia Economic
Summit said a shortage of credit caused by banking problems, weak
worldwide demand, and heavy loan burdens among producers had
thwarted export hopes.
	   Total ASEAN exports grew 6.34 percent in 1997 to dlrs 351.6
billion, compared to average annual growth of 16.5 percent during
the 1993-96 period, Severino said. Exports were virtually flat in
the second half of the year as the effects of the crisis began, he
said.

Netanyahu seeks Cabinet backing for agreement with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hardline members of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's Cabinet demanded Tuesday that he not hand over any West
Bank land unless the Palestinians meet a number of conditions, such
as revoking the PLO Covenant.
	   The demands by ministers from the National Religious Party were
delivered in a special Cabinet meeting held a day before Netanyahu
was to leave for a series of meetings with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and U.S. officials in Washington.
	   The NRP is a patron of the Jewish settlement movement in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip and threatens to topple Netanyahu's
coalition over a West Bank pullback. The party has enough seats in
the 120-member parliament to rob Netanyahu of his parliamentary
majority.
	   The NRP wants the Palestinians to extradite suspects in attacks
on Israelis and to cancel clauses in the PLO founding charter that
call for the destruction of Israel, said party spokesman Joshua
Mor-Yosef.
	   In addition, the NRP stipulated that Netanyahu not sign a
withdrawal agreement unless the scope of an additional pullback is
decided on now, Mor-Yosef said.
	   If Netanyahu wraps up a deal without meeting these conditions
the NRP will bring down the government, Mor-Yosef said.
	   Netanyahu has agreed in principle to hand over 13 percent of the
West Bank, with some restrictions. The key issue to be tackled in
Washington is to work out an agreement on what constitutes a good
faith Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   A government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Netanyahu will support the NRP's demands on security and the PLO
Charter, but will not agree to any formal Cabinet decision
restricting his power to negotiate.
	   The Palestinians said many differences remained and that they
were skeptical about Israel's willingness to conclude an agreement.
	   ``He (Netanyahu) declared he is not going to Washington with
maps. What are we negotiating if he is not going with maps?'' said
Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath.
	   The Palestinians have rejected new Israeli security demands,
noting that a three-way understanding on a Palestinian crackdown on
Islamic militants was negotiated last year, but was scrapped by
Netanyahu at the last minute.
	   In the meantime, the Palestinians made new demands of their own,
insisting that Jewish settlers be disarmed.
	   CIA director George Tenet, who has participated in recent the
negotiations on a new security memorandum, failed to bridge the
gaps, Israel radio said.

Hong Kong share prices close higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange closed
generally higher in decreased trading Tuesday.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
rose 18.56 points, or 0.2 percent, closing at 9,008.83. On Monday,
the index had surged 483.48 points.
	   Turnover amounted to 7.198 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
922 million), down from Monday's 12.807 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 1.64 billion).
	   Brokers said share prices fell for most of the session on
profit-taking following the sharp gains Monday, when the index
soared 5.6 percent.
	   However, a rally in the last 30 minutes of trading sent the
index into positive territory.
	   Brokers said investors remained optimistic of a cut in local
interest rates later this week.
	   Among gainers, HSBC Holdings rose 2.00 Hong Kong dollars to
158.50, Cheung Kong rose 90 cents to 46.60, and Hong Kong Telecom
rose 30 cents to 16.05.
	   Among losers, Hang Seng Bank fell 50 cents to 59.00, and
Hutchison Whampoa fell 20 cents to 49.50.

Moldovan to miss Romania's qualifier in Hungary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romania's striker Viorel Moldovan will
miss Wednesday's qualifier in Hungary, the soccer federation said
Tuesday.
	   The statement, quoting team doctor Pompiliu Popescu, said
Moldovan ruptured a thigh muscle in his right leg on Saturday
during a 1-0 victory over Portugal.
	   Moldovan, who plays for the Turkish club Fenerbahce, will
probably be replaced with rising star Adrian Mutu, who plays for FC
Arges and Romania's under-21 soccer team.
	   Three other key players will miss the match in Budapest.
Strikers Adrian Ilie of Valencia and Radu Niculescu of Rapid
Bucharest are being treated for leg injuries. Both missed the
Portugal match, in which striker Laurentiu Rosu was sent off and
will be sidelined for the match with Hungary.
	   Striker Gheorghe Craioveanu, of Spain's Villareal, will join the
team after FIFA suspended him recently for insulting a referee.
	   Private television Antena 1 reported Tuesday that almost 10,000
Romanians are expected to attend the match on Wednesday. There are
1.7 million ethnic Hungarians living in Romania.
	   Romania and Slovakia lead the group having six points from two
games, while Hungary and Portugal have each three points from two
games. Azerbaijan and Liechtenstein have no points.

Russia to expand role of foreign banks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with oil exports up, minor editing. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov promised Tuesday
to expand the role of foreign banks in Russia, and said his
government has no plans to nationalize domestic banks, not even
those on the verge of bankruptcy.
	   Primakov also said during a meeting with two dozen of Russia's
biggest banks that between dlrs 1.5 and dlrs 2 billion has been
sent out of the country, some of it illegally, since the latest
economic crisis struck in mid-August.
	   The Central Bank recently said more than that was stashed abroad
in September alone.
	   No details were released of Primakov's plans for foreign banks,
which are currently not allowed to provide retail services in
Russia. All the major international banks have offices in Russia,
devoted mostly to corporate and investment services.
	   ``We cannot manage without expanding opportunities for foreign
banks in Russia, without the expansion of foreign capital in assets
of Russian banks,'' Primakov said, in remarks broadcast on national
television.
	   The Russian media have given varied accounts of how the
government is likely to respond to the banking crisis.
	   Some reports have said the government is considering
nationalizing the country's leading banks, while other reports said
the government will seek only to rescue ailing banks, and will
leave them in private hands.
	   Some commercial banks have failed, and most have frozen accounts
or allow only limited transactions. The banks regularly run out of
rubles and foreign currencies sought by customers.
	   Clients of six major private banks have been advised to transfer
their accounts to the state savings bank, where they would be
guaranteed. Any savings in foreign currencies would, however, be
converted into rubles at an unfavorable rate.
	   Primakov said the lack of plans to nationalize banks does not
mean the government will rescue all those in trouble. ``Our goal
isn't to save all banks,'' he said.
	   The government says it plans to make public its proposals to
overcome the crisis by Oct. 20. However, it acknowledges these will
be mostly stop-gap measures rather than a comprehensive, long-term
plan.
	   The government's fourth-quarter budget will also be made public
next week. Primakov says the budget depends on the International
Monetary Fund releasing frozen installments in a dlrs 22.6 billion
bailout package negotiated before the crisis hit.
	   The IMF says it wants to see details of the government's
economic plan, plus signs it has been implemented, before it will
release more money. An IMF delegation is expected to return to
Moscow next week.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced that crude oil exports
soared to 84.78 million metric tons (93.25 million short tons) in
the first eight months of 1998, up 10 percent over the same period
last year.
	   With world oil prices at their lowest level in a decade,
however, revenue fell 28 percent from last year to dlrs 6.68
billion, the State Statistics Committee said.
	   Russia had promised to cut oil exports in an effort to stabilize
world prices.

Argentine president critical of EU farm subsidies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Argentine President Carlos Menem criticized
European Union subsidies for farmers, saying such practices run
contrary to the spirit of the free market.
	   ``In Argentina, we feel that our partners don't practice what
they preach, and that's painful,'' Menem was quoted as saying in an
interview published Tuesday by French daily Le Figaro.
	   ``The market economy must be transparent and lucid,'' Menem
added. ``Argentina in no way protects its agricultural
production.''
	   The Argentine leader was due to arrive in Paris later Tuesday
for a four-day visit.
	   Under Menem's leadership, Argentina's economy has been
transformed over the last decade. Free market policies slashed
hyperinflation and fueled unprecedented growth. The country is now
a bullish exporter of commodities.
	   Argentina is a member of the Cairns group _ a free trade lobby
organization pressing for an end to farm tariffs and non-tariff
barriers to agricultural trade throughout the world.
	   Menem, 68, said the 60-strong delegation accompanying him to
France would look to seal more investments.
	   ``We will tell the French _ and then the rest of the European
Union _ about our transformation, and invite people to invest,''
Menem said. ``Our country is credible and trustworthy, and its
institutions, economy and finances are solid.''
	   Menem will meet with French President Jacques Chirac on
Wednesday and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Thursday.
	   After leaving France, he heads to Portugal for the Oct. 17-18
Ibero-American Summit.
	   France is the third biggest foreign investor in Argentina, after
the United States and Spain, with interests in the car, water,
telecommunications, food and energy sectors. Between 1990 and 1996,
it invested dlrs 4.6 billion in Argentina.

UN makes exception to travel ban because 'stakes too high'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede. Minor editing throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ The United Nations made an exception
to its travel ban to Afghanistan to allow a special envoy to meet
the Taliban's reclusive leader and try to defuse a tense border
standoff with Iran, a senior official said Tuesday.
	   Lakhdar Brahimi got special permission from the U.N. secretary
general to travel to Afghanistan on Wednesday because ``the stakes
are much too high,'' said James Ngobi, acting head of the U.N.
special mission headquarters in Pakistan.
	   During Brahimi's one-day visit to the Taliban heartland in
southern Kandahar he is expected to meet Taliban chief Mullah
Mohammed Omar.
	   The former Algerian foreign minister, Brahimi will be the first
special envoy sent by the secretary general to meet the reclusive
leader.
	   Omar has rejected several attempts by Brahimi's predecessors for
a face-to-face meeting. Omar's control of the hardline Taliban
militia which rules 90 percent of Afghanistan is undisputed.
	   It is Omar's interpretation of the Muslim holy book, the Koran,
that has resulted in the strict rules throughout the area the
Taliban controls.
	   Women in Taliban-territory are not allowed to work, schools for
girls are closed, men are required to wear beards and a head
covering. Most forms of light entertainment have been banned and
prayer five times a day is compulsory.
	   Brahimi is in the region to find a peaceful end to the stand off
between the Taliban religious army and neighboring Iran, which
deployed 200,000 soldiers to its border with Afghanistan after its
diplomats were killed by renegade Taliban soldiers in August.
	   Before agreeing to go to Kandahar, Brahimi received a promise
from the Taliban to give a ``full explanation'' behind attacks on
U.N. workers, including the death of an Italian official in August,
said Ngobi.
	   The U.N. pulled its international staff out of Afghanistan on
Aug. 21, after a U.N. worker was shot and killed, in apparent
retaliation for the U.S. missile attack on suspected terrorist
camps in eastern Afghanistan.
	   ``The Taliban until now have not been able to explain the
circumstances of the U.N. workers who have been murdered, shot at
and harassed ... we said we do not go back until these things are
addressed,'' Ngobi told The Associated Press in an interview.
	   Tehran is demanding an apology from the Taliban, the culprits
who killed the diplomats and the return of an estimated 50 Iranians
being held in Kandahar by the Taliban.

Students resume protests demanding trial for Suharto, more reform
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Students resumed protests in front of
parliament Tuesday, demanding more reforms and a trial for former
President Suharto on charges of abusing power during his 32-year
rule.
	   Some 1,000 students from various universities first were blocked
by hundreds of police about 200 meters (yards) away before being
allowed to rally in front of parliament's main gate.
	   The protest by the ``Communication Forum for Jakarta's Students
Senate'' was the first there since Oct. 5, the 53rd anniversary of
Indonesia's military. In that demonstration, students protested
allowing soldiers to act as legislators and hold other civilian
posts.
	   On Tuesday, the students waved banners demanding ``Clean
parliament of KKN _ an Indonesian abbreviation for corruption,
collusion and nepotism _ and ``We need new president.''
	   In a statement submitted to parliament, the students also
demanded the exclusion of ``anti-reformist as well as
pro-Suhartoist'' elements from parliament and the People's
Consultative Assembly.
	   They called on the Assembly to authorize President B.J. Habibie
or his successor to put former Suharto on trial for alleged abuse
of power.
	   Suharto was forced to quit in May by widespread protests and
riots amid Indonesia's worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   His successor, longtime friend Habibie, has promised reform,
more democracy and elections next year.
	   The attorney general's office is investigating the wealth of the
77-year-old Suharto, who has been accused of illegally enriching
himself, his family and close associates during his rule, which
began in 1966.
	   Vice Speaker Lt. Gen. Hari Sabarno, who received a 25-member
delegation of the students, said their demands would be taken up at
the next meeting of parliament's various factions.

Yeltsin stays home with respiratory infection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs to UPDATE with deputy premier saying
illness minor. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin stayed home Tuesday,
nursing a respiratory infection that forced him to cut short a
foreign trip and revived concerns about his ability to govern.
	   Yeltsin will spend the day at his Gorky-9 country residence just
outside Moscow, said his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, according to
Russian news agencies. He refused to comment on Yeltsin's
condition.
	   Doctors insisted Monday that Yeltsin fly home from Central Asia
a day ahead of schedule because he was suffering from an upper
respiratory infection and had a mild fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3
F).
	   They said Yeltsin was being treated with antibiotics and there
were no plans to hospitalize him.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has a history of health problems, including
quintuple heart bypass surgery two years ago, so whenever he gets
sick there is a flurry of speculation about his ability to
function.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no major illness and plans to serve out
the remaining two years of his term.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Vadim Gustov also sought to play down
Yeltsin's illness Tuesday, telling Interfax it was nothing more
than a cold or the flu.
	   ``The president has the flu,'' he said. ``He is coughing and
sneezing.''
	   But the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper said in a front-page
editorial Tuesday that Yeltsin's condition suggests he is suffering
from something worse than a cold.
	   It said his absence from the Kremlin during the current economic
crisis ``amounts to a state catastrophe'' and called on Yeltsin to
immediately surrender most of his powers to Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   Other newspapers gave a detailed description of Yeltsin's
weaknesses and his erratic behavior on the trip to the former
Soviet republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakstan _ his first foray
abroad since a visit to Britain in May.
	   The president appeared stiff and stumbled when he arrived Sunday
in Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent. He had to be supported by
Uzbek President Islam Karimov and canceled his other public events.
	   At a state dinner on Sunday, Yeltsin made rambling remarks,
expressing his satisfaction with local ``facilities and stores'' he
never inspected, the daily Kommersant reported.
	   On Monday, ``the president didn't seem to understand that he
wasn't in Moscow,'' Kommersant said, saying he called aides and
spoke as though they were late for work at the Kremlin.
	   He turned up more than an hour late for talks with Uzbek
officials, making some incoherent remarks interrupted by a bad
cough and abruptly cutting short a scheduled news conference.
	   Shortly after Yeltsin arrived in neighboring Kazakstan, his
aides announced he would be heading home Monday night instead of
Tuesday, as originally scheduled.
	   Yeltsin's daughter Tatiana Dyachenko, who is his official image
adviser, said the president's ailment wasn't serious. ``Don't
panic, the Dad is OK,'' she said, according to Kommersant.

Ministry says September jobless rise lowest since 1981
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Jobless claims in Spain rose to 11.02
percent of the economically active population in September, up from
10.95 percent in August, the Labor Ministry said Tuesday in an
advance release.
	   But the ministry claimed September's 0.64 percent increase was a
positive sign, saying it was the lowest registered since 1981.
	   Unemployment claims traditionally rise in September as seasonal
summer jobs come to an end.
	   Investors tend to watch the national statistics institute's
quarterly unemployment data more closely than the labor ministry's
monthly jobless-claims data because the latter includes everyone
who is out of work, rather than just those eligible for
unemployment benefit.
	   At end of the second quarter unemployment in Spain was
calculated at 18.9 percent, one of the highest rates in Europe.

Report: Protesters threaten to sever main railway line
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ About 400 demonstrators tried to block one of
China's main railway arteries to protest against finance companies
that allegedly cheated them out of investments, a human rights
group said Tuesday.
	   Authorities deployed hundreds of police to break up the protest
Saturday in Zhengzhou, central China, and protect the north-south
rail line from Beijing to Guangzhou that runs through the city, the
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement said.
	   Watched by thousands of bystanders, the protesters twice broke
through a police cordon, almost reaching the rail line, the Hong
Kong-based group said. Police responded by detaining two protest
leaders and forcing the demonstrators to disperse, it said.
	   Police charged the leaders, Ma Ling and Gao Zhifeng, with
disturbing public order, the group said.
	   Zhengzhou is 660 kilometers (400 miles) south of Beijing in
Henan province. Local officials contacted by telephone from Beijing
confirmed that a protest and arrests took place, but refused to
provide details.
	   The Information Center said the protesters lost money to nine
investment companies in Zhengzhou that Henan authorities shut down
in May, allegedly for gathering funds illegally.
	   The companies had more than 10,000 investors in Zhengzhou who
had contributed a total 3 billion yuan (dlrs 360 million) in funds
since 1995, and some of the money is now alleged to be missing, the
group said.
	   It said one company that allegedly had close connections with
local leaders and advertised in official media had collected 500
million yuan (dlrs 60 million) in investments but had just 100
million yuan (dlrs 12 million) left in assets when it was shut
down.
	   In June, a month after local authorities closed down the
companies, several thousand investors protested outside Zhengzhou's
city hall, the group said.

Holbrooke says agreement may mark turning point

 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on
Tuesday described the result of days of talks with Slobodan
Milosevic as a possible turning point in steps to end the Kosovo
crisis, but said it depends on the Yugoslav president.
	   Holbrooke made his remarks to a news conference just hours after
President Clinton announced that the Yugoslav president had
promised to adhere to international demands.
	   ``I cannot stress too highly how deeply concerned we are about
what happened in the past few months in Kosovo ... the unnecessary
horror of it,'' Holbrooke said.
	   ``We hope this will mark a turning point in the right direction.
But the proof ... is in compliance with U.N. resolution 1199 and
with actions on the ground in Kosovo, regarding the deployment of
security forces, the return of refugees to their homes, the end of
armed violence on all sides, the repairing of the damage and in
some cases wanton destruction, and the creation most importantly of
a political process that gives the people of Kosovo autonomy and
self-determination.''
	   He said a statement to be made by Milosevic's government later
in the day would be critical in signifying their commitment to
settling the crisis.
	   The status of future talks was not immediately clear.

Suharto's son questioned over bank fraud case in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Prosecutors have questioned the eldest
son of former President Suharto as a witness in a dlrs 25 million
fraud case, the Jakarta Post reported Tuesday.
	   The newspaper said Sigit Harjojudanto was questioned for seven
hours in the third most populous city, Medan, on Monday.
	   He refused to comment to reporters later, it said.
	   It was the second time in two weeks that one of Suharto's
children has been questioned about possible violations of banking
laws.
	   Prosecutors said they questioned Sigit about a 1995 share deal
involving a company that took loans from the North Sumatra Regional
Development Bank despite a lack of adequate collateral.
	   Suharto quit as president in May after a wave of protests and
riots left 1,200 people dead.
	   Critics claim he abused his power to enrich himself and his
family during his 32 authoritarian years in office.
	   Suharto is now at the center of a government corruption inquiry
even though he steadfastly maintains that he has done nothing
wrong.
	   Since his resignation, members of his family have had a range of
lucrative government contracts with their companies canceled. There
has also been greater scrutiny placed on their past business deals.
	   On Oct. 2, Bambang Trihatmodjo, Suharto's second son, was
questioned over the collapse of Bank Andromeda, of which he was
part owner.
	   The bank was among 14 closed last November for allegedly
violating lending limits set by the central bank, Bank Indonesia.
	   Police are investigating possible violations of banking laws.
Bambang and other bankers have been banned from leaving the
country.

North Korean man defects to South Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A man claiming to be a retired North
Korean army officer arrived in Seoul Tuesday and sought asylum, the
government intelligence agency said.
	   Shim Sin-bok, 48, identifying himself as a former army
lieutenant colonel, fled North Korea last year and had been living
in hiding in an unidentified third country, it said.
	   Since retiring from the army in 1992, Shim had worked as an
engineer at a paper mill outside Pyongyang, the North's capital,
the Agency for National Security Planning said.
	   Shim told investigators that he fled North Korea because he was
caught criticizing what he believed was the undemocratic rule of
leader Kim Jong Il, the agency said.
	   The agency gave no other details, including from where and how
Shim was allowed into South Korea.
	   So far this year, 49 North Koreans have defected to South Korea,
mostly through China. All cited severe food and fuel shortages in
the communist nation.
	   The Korean Peninsula was divided into the communist North and
the capitalist South in 1945. They fought a three-year war in the
early 1950s.

then we will feel it was worth coming here, we will feel that

compliance on the ground in Kosovo,'' he said.

Blair says NATO still prepared to use force
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday hailed the
deal on Kosovo as a breakthrough, but warned that NATO was still
prepared to use force to ensure that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic complies with the agreement.
	   ``He's got to be in no doubt this is not brinkmanship by us,''
Blair said. ``We are prepared to see this thing through. We are
prepared to us force if necessary.''
	   Monday's agreement came when Milosevic agreed to withdraw his
forces from Kosovo, begin peace negotiations with ethnic Albanians
and allow international observers into the Yugoslav province.
	   In return, NATO agreed to hold off on airstrikes for four days
so the international inspectors could verify that Milosevic has met
U.N. Security Council demands to stop the violence in Kosovo.
	   ``If we can get what we need by a mixture of diplomatic means
and the threat of force, then fine,'' Blair said. ``But we have
only come this far because we have been prepared to see it through
and we will only make sure he (Milosevic) turns the commitments
he's given, the policies he has made, into actual compliance if we
are still prepared to see it through.''

Chechen president starts five-day visit for human rights
</HEADLINE>
conference &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The president of Russia's breakaway
Chechnya region starts a five-day visit Tuesday to participate in
an international human rights conference.
	   During his stay, President Aslan Maskhadov will be protected by
a body guard assigned by the Foreign Ministry. However, he will not
meet with any of Poland's government leaders.
	   ``We did not seek such meetings to avoid provoking tension in
Poland's relations with Russia,'' said Mariusz Kaminski, a
Solidarity parliament member who helped organize the visit.
	   Maskhadov will meet with some prominent politicians, including
the leader of the Solidarity bloc, Marian Krzaklewski, and the
leader of the extreme right party, Movement for Poland's Renewal,
Jan Olszewski.
	   He will be accompanied by the Chechen Foreign Minister Movladi
Ugudov.
	   Maskhadov won a landslide election victory in January 1997, but
during his time in office, Chechnya has seen a steep rise in
kidnappings and other crimes.
	   No country has recognized Chechnya's claims of independence, and
Russia still considers it a semi-autonomous Russian republic.
	   The conference, which starts on Wednesday, was organized by a
human rights activist Zbigniew Romaszewski.

	   Holbrooke emphasized that the U.S. delegation was not
proclaiming the talks a victory, saying ``we're not out of the
emergency yet.''
	   ``But if this is the road past the end of the emergency, ...
then we will feel it was worth coming here, we will feel that
international solidarity helped end the crisis,'' he said.
	   ``Let's not call it a triumph ... until something was done that
was meaningful for the people of Kosovo.''
	   He indicated that the key was Milosevic having allowed a
verification force in Kosovo.
	   ``All I can say is, what we are talking about here is not words
... but compliance on the ground in Kosovo,'' he said.

Warnings up as `super typhoon' churns nearer northern provinces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Zeb turned into a ``super typhoon''
Tuesday as it churned nearer the northern Philippines, prompting
authorities to raise storm warnings in at least 23 provinces.
	   At 5 p.m. (0900 GMT), the Manila weather bureau said Zeb,
packing peak winds of 220 kilometers (138 miles) per hour and gusts
of up to 265 kph (166 mph), was centered over the Pacific Ocean,
about 480 kilometers (300 miles) northwest of Manila. It was moving
northwest at 28 kph (18 mph).
	   Weather forecaster Susan Dampog said Zeb, the strongest of eight
storms to strike the country this year, was expected to skirt
Cagayan province and hit the Batanes island group, the country's
northernmost province, by Wednesday afternoon.
	   Dampog said the typhoon was expected to dump heavy rains across
wide areas of the country.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, the country's chief disaster
relief officer, said he has sent government officials to coastal
and flood-prone areas to tell residents to evacuate to higher
ground.
	   ``These typhoons can cause great damage, and people in the
vulnerable areas may drown,'' Mercado said in a radio broadcast.
``We are appealing to you, for your own sake, to leave your homes
before you face danger.''
	   Disaster relief offices have been put on alert for possible
massive evacuation of residents.
	   Dampog said five northern provinces have been on highest storm
alert and are likely to bear the brunt of Zeb, which is expected to
intensify further as it nears land.
	   A storm gains ``super typhoon'' status if its maximum sustained
winds reach 220 kph (138 mph).
	   Last month, tropical storm Vicki struck the northern
Philippines, causing at least 52 deaths on land. A ferry also sank
during the storm south of Manila, leaving 70 passengers dead and 80
others missing.

Cabinet approves Sharon's appointment as foreign minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's Cabinet on Tuesday unanimously
approved the appointment of hawkish former general Ariel Sharon as
foreign minister, Israel radio reported.
	   A spokesman for the Cabinet could not immediately confirm the
move.
	   The appointment of Sharon, announced last week by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, was seen as a bid to neutralize right-wing
critics in advance of this week's U.S. summit with President
Clinton and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Ministers from the National Religious Party have threatened to
bring down the government if Netanyahu signs an agreement on an
Israeli troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Sharon himself has been a major backer of Jewish settlers in the
West Bank who are bitterly opposed to the withdrawal. He himself
has said a 13 percent withdrawal would be a disaster for Israel.
	   But it is believed that if Sharon is involved in the
negotiations, it would be easier for right-wing ministers to remain
in the government.
	   Palestinian leaders have criticized the choice of Sharon, saying
it is aimed at halting the peace process.

Thai renegade party faction will retain Cabinet posts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A group of politicians expelled from
their opposition party for supporting Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
will retain their quota of Cabinet posts in his government even
though they are expected to be kicked out of Parliament, their
leader said Tuesday.
	   The support of the 12 renegade members of the Prachakorn Thai
(Thai Citizens) Party was essential when Chuan formed his
government last November.
	   But it infuriated their party leader, Samak Sundaravej, one of
the country's most outspoken conservative politicians and a bitter
foe of Chuan and his ruling Democrat Party. Samak dubbed them the
``Cobra'' faction.
	   After much legal maneuvering, his party managed to expel the 12
renegades Saturday.
	   Some of the expelled politicians have said they will appeal
their expulsions to the Constitutional Court. But legal precedent
makes it likely that their expulsion from the party means they will
also lose their parliamentary seats.
	   The group will maintain their seats in the Cabinet but their
status as lawmakers awaits a ruling of the Constitutional Court to
determine if their expulsion was legal, the breakaway faction
leader, Vatana Asavahame, told reporters Tuesday.
	   Local newspapers Tuesday quoted Chuan as saying Vatana, a deputy
interior minister, and Prime Minister's Office Minister Somboon
Rahong, the two top members of the renegade faction, would be kept
in the Cabinet lineup regardless of their status in Parliament.
	   The support of the 12 is no longer essential to Chuan, however.
Earlier this month, he recruited another opposition group, the
Chart Pattana Party, into his coalition government, bolstering his
parliamentary majority.

	   The citation said their work led to ``yet another breakthrough
in our understanding of quantum physics and to the development of
new theoretical concepts of significance in many branches of modern
physics.''
	   The 7.6-million-kronor (dlrs 978,000) prize will be divided
equally among the three.
	   Last year's physics laureates, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of France
and William Phillips and Steven Chu of the United States, were
honored for developing ways of trapping atoms of gas and cooling
them to within a millionth of a degree of absolute zero.
	   The work led to developing extraordinarily accurate atomic
clocks. Previous atomic clocks weren't exactly sloppy, being
accurate to about one second in 32 million years _ but the
improvements made possible a clock that loses just one second every
3 billion years.
	   It also led to the creation of an entirely new form of matter,
achieving what Albert Einstein had postulated was possible some 70
years earlier.
	   The 1997 chemistry winners, American Paul D. Boyer, John E.
Walker of Britain and Jens C. Skou of Denmark, discovered aspects
of how the body's cells store and use energy, a fundamental process
that affects everything from the building of bones to the
transmission of nerve impulses.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   Furchgott, 82, is a pharmacologist at the State University of
New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn; Ignarro, 57, is at the
University of California at Los Angeles; and Murad, 62, is at the
University of Texas Medical School in Houston.
	   Their finding helped lead to the discovery of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra and could also pay off in new treatments for heart
disease, cancer and septic shock.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago. The economics prize winner is to be named
on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
	   All the prizes are announced in Stockholm, except for the peace
prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes
in his will.

Mandela says has no intention of influencing Boesak trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela on
Tuesday said he did not want to influence the fraud trial of Allan
Boesak and apologized if his support for the former African
National Congress official gave that impression.
	   Last month Mandela told reporters he believed Boesak was
innocent and said he would help raise money to pay a shortfall in
fees for his defense team.
	   The remarks sparked outrage among opposition political parties
who said Mandela was trying to interfere with the courts to help an
old friend. Western Cape Attorney-general Frank Kahn, ultimately in
charge of all prosecutions in Cape Town, wrote to Mandela querying
his comments.
	   In a letter to Kahn issued Tuesday, Mandela's lawyers said the
president had no intention of challenging the principle of an
independent judiciary.
	   If Mandela's remarks ``may have had the unintended consequence
of challenging this ideal, it is regretted,'' the letter said.
	   Kahn said the letter had now settled the matter and ``the whole
unfortunate incident is regarded as closed.''
	   Boesak, a former minister who once headed the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches, is accused of stealing money from the Foundation
for Peace and Justice.
	   He has pleaded innocent to 32 charges of fraud and theft of
about a million rand, then worth about dlrs 300,000. Donations to
the foundation came from singer Paul Simon, the Coca-Cola
Foundation, Scandinavian aid agencies and other people and groups.
	   The trial was delayed when defense lawyers walked off the case
after Boesak's money ran out.
	   It resumes Monday when Boesak will tell the court whether he has
raised enough money to rehire his lawyers, or must begin the
lengthy process of finding new _ and cheaper _ counsel.

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Health officials say the number of Singaporeans
infected with the AIDS virus may be almost four times the official
estimate, national television reported Tuesday.
	   The Ministry of Health admitted that a recent World Health
Organization estimate that about 3,100 Singaporeans have contracted
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, could be accurate as many cases
here are unreported.
	   Conservative Singapore estimates the number of carriers here at
854.
	   The government passed a law last month requiring foreign
students studying here for long periods of time and all foreign
workers _ from bricklayers to bank executives _ to take medical
exams showing they are HIV-negative.
	   Those carrying the virus and highly infectious diseases are not
allowed to reside in the city-state.
	   Health officials said Monday that in addition to HIV carriers'
reticence about their condition, many others who may have been
exposed to the disease were unwilling to test themselves, according
to the report.
	   The ministry said the majority of Singaporeans who contract HIV
do so through unprotected, heterosexual sex. It added that some
Singaporeans still engaged in high-risk sexual activities when they
ventured overseas, typically by having sex with prostitutes.

	   Holbrooke made his remarks to a news conference just hours after
President Clinton announced that the Yugoslav president had
promised to adhere to international demands.
	   ``I cannot stress too highly how deeply concerned we are about
what happened in the past few months in Kosovo ... the unnecessary
horror of it,'' Holbrooke said.
	   ``We hope this will mark a turning point in the right direction.
But the proof ... is in compliance with U.N. resolution 1199 and
with actions on the ground in Kosovo,'' he said.
	   The U.S. trouble-shooter had returned to the Yugoslav capital
early Tuesday and met for an hour with Milosevic, just hours after
NATO set a four-day deadline for the Yugoslav president to back up
a new promise to end his crackdown against ethnic Albanians and
cooperate in efforts to restore normalcy to the southern Serbian
province.
	   Holbrooke said he was flying from Belgrade to Rome and then on
to New York, after concluding more than a week of intense
negotiations in Belgrade.
	   The 16-nation alliance NATO took its decision after Holbrooke
flew to NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, to brief
ambassadors on his talks with Milosevic.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton was the first to announce
Milosevic's concessions, saying he had agreed to withdraw his
forces from the province, initiate autonomy negotiations with the
separatist ethnic Albanians and allow a force of as many as 2,000
international observers to ensure U.N. demands are met.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three scientists working at
universities in the United States on Tuesday won the Nobel Physics
Prize for discovering that electrons on under certain circumstances
can form new kinds of particles.
	   The prize went to Robert C. Laughlin of the United States, Horst
L. Stoermer of Germany and China-born Daniel C. Tsui.
	   The citation from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said
they discovered that electrons acting together in strong magnetic
fields can form new types of particles that carry charges that are
fractions of electron charges.
	   Laughlin is at Stanford University, Stoermer currently is at
Columbia University in New York City and Tsui teaches at Princeton
University.
	   The citation said their work led to ``yet another breakthrough

Author: Champagne invented in England, not France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sacre bleu! A wine buff says he has proof that it
was the British _ not the French _ who invented champagne.
	   Author Tom Stevenson has spent the last 12 years trying to
persuade the wine world that there is a hiccup in the accepted
history of the wine-making method that produces champagne.
	   ``The documentary evidence describing the addition of sugar to a
finished wine to induce a second fermentation for the specific
purpose of making it sparkle does exist,'' Stevenson said. ``And it
is not Rheims or Epernay, the towns at the heart of Champagne, it
is in London.''
	   In his latest book, ``A World Encyclopedia of Champagne and
Sparkling Wine,'' Stevenson publishes a document he says proves the
British were the first to deliberately produce a sparkling wine.
	   The paper, written by British scientist Christopher Merret,
reported his observations on making sparkling wine and was
presented to the British Royal Society in 1662.
	   That was 20 years before legendary blind French monk Dom
Perignon was said to have perfected the champagne method to create
the world's most exclusive sparkling wine.
	   His discovery is commemorated with a statue in Rheims in eastern
France and his name was given to one of the most famous deluxe
vintage champagnes, marketed by producer Moet et Chandon.
	   Now only wine made from grapes grown in the Champagne region,
which lies 60 miles east of Paris, can carry the name.
	   ``There is absolutely no evidence that Dom Perignon made a
single bottle of sparkling wine,'' Stevenson said. ``The more you
learn about him, the more you think that if he was doing anything
he was trying to get the bubbles out of the bottle, not put them in
there. The French didn't like sparkling wine.''

Three researchers in America win Nobel Physics Prize

 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that Tsui is a China-born American citizen, gives
pronucniations &QL;

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three scientists working at
universities in the United States on Tuesday won the Nobel Physics
Prize for discovering that electrons on under certain circumstances
can form new kinds of particles.
	   The prize went to Robert C. Laughlin of the United States, Horst
L. Stoermer of Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a China-born American
citizen.
	   The citation from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said
they discovered that electrons acting together in strong magnetic
fields can form new types of particles that carry charges that are
fractions of electron charges.
	   Laughlin is at Stanford University, Stoermer (pronounced
STER-mer) currently is at Columbia University in New York City and
Tsui (TSOO-ee) teaches at Princeton University.
	   The citation said their work led to ``yet another breakthrough
in our understanding of quantum physics and to the development of
new theoretical concepts of significance in many branches of modern
physics.''
	   The 7.6-million-kronor (dlrs 978,000) prize will be divided
equally among the three.
	   Last year's physics laureates, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of France
and William Phillips and Steven Chu of the United States, were
honored for developing ways of trapping atoms of gas and cooling
them to within a millionth of a degree of absolute zero.
	   The work led to developing extraordinarily accurate atomic
clocks. Previous atomic clocks weren't exactly sloppy, being
accurate to about one second in 32 million years _ but the
improvements made possible a clock that loses just one second every
3 billion years.

Asian economic crisis threatens Singapore society, official says
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Asian financial crisis now is threatening
Singapore's social cohesion as well as its economy, the deputy
prime minister said Tuesday.
	   ``This is not just an economic problem; it is also a challenge
to our social cohesion and our resolve to survive and thrive as a
nation,'' Lee Hsien Loong told a group of business people in Hong
Kong.
	   The crisis and the relatively small depreciation of the
Singapore dollar are forcing businesses to cut costs, especially
wage costs, Lee said.
	   ``Wages make up 40 percent of costs,'' he said. ``In the crisis,
the exchange rates of many countries have fallen sharply, but their
nominal wages have not gone up to compensate. We therefore need to
reduce wage costs significantly.''
	   Layoffs are approaching high levels not seen since the last
recession in 1985-86, and the minority ethnic Malay population has
suffered the brunt of the cuts. Unemployment has reached 3.2
percent.
	   Many of Lee's comments on Singapore's situation in the Asian
crisis struck a chord in Hong Kong, where many companies have cut
wages by 10 percent. Hong Kong's economy also has been dragged down
by external factors and its strong currency.
	   ``For us, the driving forces of the slowdown are largely
external, and beyond our control,'' Lee said.
	   The government has introduced a series of initiatives to ensure
economic recovery and is putting together a cost-cutting package,
to be announced in November, that will enhance the country's
competitiveness, he added.
	   Comparing Hong Kong's and Singapore's financial services, he
said: ``The old phrase was that in Hong Kong what was not
explicitly forbidden was allowed, whereas in Singapore what was not
explicitly allowed was forbidden. I believe the part about Hong
Kong is still true, but we have changed the Singapore part.''
	   Lee, who is also chairman of the Monetary Authority of
Singapore, stressed that country's economic fundamentals and its
banking system are sound.
	   ``Banks may lose money, but they will not become insolvent or
inadequately capitalized,'' he said.
	   He also said that the government will continue to respond to the
market in its land sales and not try to use its position as a major
supplier of land to set the property market.
	   Singapore property prices are ``not yet ready to go up sharply
and may weaken a little further,'' he said.
	   Commenting on his view of what caused the Asian financial
crisis, he said: ``The preponderant factors in Asia were
pre-existing banking weaknesses, compounded by government mistakes
that caused investors to lose confidence and stampede.''
	   Lee also said that Malaysia's capital controls and other
measures intended to solve its economic problems go ``against
conventional views of the way to tackle the problem.''
	   Singapore's economy is closely linked to its neighbor Malaysia,
where the government has fixed the exchange rate, halted trading of
its currency overseas, and promoted greater bank lending in efforts
to promote growth.
	   ``Singapore hopes that Malaysia's policies will succeed in
restoring its country to economic health, but backtracking from
globalization cannot be the answer for the world,'' he said.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three scientists working in the United
States won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for their discoveries
of how sub-atomic particles can behave like a fluid.
	   Robert C. Laughlin of the United States, Horst L. Stoermer of
Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a native of China who is now an
American citizen, won for discovering that electrons acting
together in strong magnetic fields can form new types of particles,

	   The three men will share the dlrs 978,000 prize.

Congo's northeast falls victim to tribal bickering, intervention

	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Back in the golden years, Kasuku wa Ngeyo had
a farm and was the head of a 25,000-strong farmers organization in
the northeastern breadbasket of this central African nation.
	   A quarter of a century later, the 56-year-old businessman who
also ran hotels and a tourist camp is broke; the farmers group is a
memory.
	   Inter-tribal rivalry, looting soldiers, Rwandan refugees and two
rebellions in as many years have wiped out half a million head of
cattle here, slashed coffee and tea exports in half and turned
Congo's bucolic eastern region of green pastures, sparkling
volcanic lakes and snow-capped mountains into a war zone.
	   ``Nobody is making money any more. People are surviving on a
sack of beans. They are tired of insecurity and have little hope
things will get better,'' said Kasuku, the son of an Italian
settler and a Rwandan Tutsi refugee mother.
	   On Aug. 2, Tutsis, political opponents, and disenchanted members
of President Laurent Kabila's army took up arms, accusing Kabila of
corruption, nepotism and fostering tribal strife.
	   The war has split Africa's third-largest nation between the
government-held west and south and rebel-controlled east, and no
political settlement is in sight.
	   Goma, a small trading post at the head of Lake Kivu in eastern
Congo, is no longer the starting point for tourists trekking to see
mountain gorillas.
	   Today, its decaying buildings, empty shops and crumbling guest
houses are home to rebel leaders, soldiers and people displaced by
violence.
	   The rebels have promised to revitalize the economy by reducing
taxes to boost investment. They also say they will pay civil
servants _ who haven't seen a paycheck in months or years _ and
invite investors to buy tea and coffee farms and gold and
diamond-mining concessions.
	   But the war has also increased tribal animosity _ especially
toward ethnic Tutsis, a tiny but highly successful minority in the
eastern region.
	   In 1990, the liberating effect of early political freedoms
revived unresolved land disputes and led to clashes between the
Rwandan Tutsis and Hutus _ who had settled in eastern Congo since
the 1930s. Mai-Mai warriors _ armed youths from the Hunde and Nande
tribes who accuse Tutsis of stealing their land, also joined the
fighting.
	   In 1994, nearly 1 million Rwandan refugees engulfed Goma, a town
of 30,000. Among them were former Hutu soldiers and militiamen who
took part in a 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda in which more
than half a million Tutsis were killed.
	   They brought anti-Tutsi ideology with them and sold weapons to
Congolese tribes, who then joined in the persecution of Tutsi
landowners and ranchers.
	   ``People misunderstood political freedoms for anarchy,'' said
Safari Ngezayo, a farmer and hotel owner. ``We tried to mediate
between Tutsis and Hutus and other tribes, but how can you talk to
people who have blood on their hands and genocide in their heads?''
	   In late 1996, Congolese Tutsis backed by Rwanda attacked the
refugee camps, dislodged the Hutu fighters and forced most of the
refugees back home across the border.
	   After an eight-month rebellion backed by Rwanda and Uganda,
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko fled in May 1997, and Kabila took power.
He quickly changed the name of the country to Congo, from Zaire.
	   Few people in northeastern Congo expected another rebellion so
soon.
	   ``I blame our politicians. Then I blame the foreign powers who
kept meddling in our affairs. It is they who supported Mobutu and
Kabila, and we are paying the interest,'' Kasuku said.

Three researchers in America win Nobel Physics Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS details of discovery. TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC;

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three scientists working at
universities in the United States on Tuesday won the Nobel Physics
Prize for discovering that electrons on under certain circumstances
can form new kinds of particles.
	   The prize went to Robert C. Laughlin of the United States, Horst
L. Stoermer of Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a China-born American
citizen.
	   The citation from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said
they discovered that electrons acting together in strong magnetic
fields can form new types of particles that carry charges that are
fractions of electron charges.
	   Laughlin is at Stanford University, Stoermer (pronounced
STER-mer) currently is at Columbia University in New York City and
Tsui (TSOO-ee) teaches at Princeton University.
	   The award recognizes work that Tsui and Stoermer did together
and that was elaborated on by Laughlin.
	   According to the citation, the three discovered a new form of
``quantum fluid,'' which are fluids such as liquid helium that have
certain properties in common such as superfluidity.
	   What makes these fluids important for researchers is that
``events in a drop of quantum fluid can afford more profound
insights into the general inner structure and dynamics of matter,''
the academy said.
	   It is ''yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics.''
	   The 7.6-million-kronor (dlrs 978,000) prize will be divided
equally among the three.
	   Last year's physics laureates, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of France
and William Phillips and Steven Chu of the United States, were
honored for developing ways of trapping atoms of gas and cooling
them to within a millionth of a degree of absolute zero.
	   The work led to developing extraordinarily accurate atomic
clocks. Previous atomic clocks weren't exactly sloppy, being
accurate to about one second in 32 million years _ but the
improvements made possible a clock that loses just one second every
3 billion years.
	   The 1997 chemistry winners, American Paul D. Boyer, John E.
Walker of Britain and Jens C. Skou of Denmark, discovered aspects
of how the body's cells store and use energy, a fundamental process
that affects everything from the building of bones to the
transmission of nerve impulses.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   Their finding helped lead to the discovery of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra and could also pay off in new treatments for heart
disease, cancer and septic shock.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago. The economics prize winner is to be named
on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
	   All the prizes are announced in Stockholm, except for the peace
prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes
in his will.

	   Holbrooke, who noted that the deal will not affect existing
sanctions against Yugoslavia, said the key to the accord was
Milosevic's decision to allow a 2,000-member ``verification
mission'' and to permit ``aerial verification'' by non-combat
aircraft that could begin as soon as the end of the week.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will
oversee the verification force.
	   Holbrooke said Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, head
of the OSCE, will soon come to Yugoslavia to sign the mission
agreement. NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark and Secretary-General
Javier Solana will also arrive to sign the aerial mission ``with
appropriate Yugoslav authorities,'' he said.
	   ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' Holbrooke said. ``They
are compliance verifiers.''
	   In addition, political negotiations with the ethnic Albanians
will continue in Kosovo, led by Christopher Hill, the U.S.
ambassador to Macedonia.
	   The Albanians have insisted on independence, rather than
regaining the autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989. But
international leaders are opposed to them breaking away from Serbia
for fear a border change will lead to further instability in the
tense Balkans.
	   Holbrooke emphasized that the U.S. delegation was not
proclaiming the talks a victory, saying ``we're not out of the
emergency yet.''
	   ``But if this is the road past the end of the emergency, ...
then we will feel it was worth coming here, we will feel that
international solidarity helped end the crisis,'' he said.
	   ``Let's not call it a triumph ... until something was done that
was meaningful for the people of Kosovo.''
	   Clinton earlier was skeptical about Milosevic's chances of doing
enough by Saturday's deadline to avoid airstrikes.
	   ``Commitments are not compliance,'' he said in New York.
``Balkan graveyards are filled with President Milosevic's broken
promises.''

Anwar's wife seeks inspiration from Philippine anti-Marcos

struggle &QL;

 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The wife of arrested Malaysian
dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim says she wants to learn from the
Philippines' struggle against the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos to
push the democratic reform movement in her country.
	   In a recent letter to former Philippine President Corazon
Aquino, Azizah Ismail said she would continue her husband's
peaceful struggle for political reforms in Malaysia.
	   ``I would be most grateful if you can further share with me your
wealth of experience gained during the period of the oppressive
Marcos regime,'' Azizah said in her Oct. 7 letter. A copy was
obtained by The Associated Press Tuesday.
	   ``It will be most valuable in assisting me to find the strength
and resilience to face the undemocratic onslaught of the current
regime in my country,'' Azizah said, adding she wanted to
personally meet Mrs. Aquino.
	   Azizah was responding to a letter Mrs. Aquino sent her earlier
by fax in which the former Philippine leader narrated her ordeal
when her husband, the late Sen. Benigno Aquino, the chief political
rival of Marcos, was arrested, jailed and then murdered upon
returning from U.S. exile in 1983.
	   The assassination of Mrs. Aquino's husband at Manila's
international airport triggered massive protests that culminated in
the ``people power'' revolt that toppled Marcos in 1986 and
installed Mrs. Aquino as president.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar as his
deputy on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy,
although Mahathir said moral issues led to the dismissal. Anwar
then began speaking out against Mahathir, and was arrested Sept. 20
on charges of corruption and sexual misconduct.
	   Thousands of Anwar's supporters have held protest demonstrations
in recent days, demanding his release.
	   In her letter, Aquino praised Azizah's courage.
	   ``By your example, I'm sure that there will be many more who
will join you as you carry on with Anwar's commitment for
reforms,'' Mrs. Aquino wrote.
	   Mrs. Aquino urged Azizah to continue inspiring the Malaysian
people ``so that more and more of them will join you and Anwar in
your quest for political and economic reforms.''
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie have also spoken out against Anwar's treatment.
	   Estrada has said he was considering skipping a summit of
Asia-Pacific leaders in Malaysia in November because of the arrest
of Anwar, whom he described as a personal friend.
	   The Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia are among the founding
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which also
includes Brunei, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Favorites Bangladesh overwhelmed Malaysia
by eight wickets Tuesday to win the Asian Cricket Council
tournament played in the Nepalese capital.
	   Bangladesh remained the unbeaten side in the 10-nation contest
and was hardly stretched by Malaysia in the finals.
	   Malaysian batsmen disappointed scoring mere 87 runs in 37 overs.
They showed lack of technique in handling medium pacers Hasibul
Hussain and Shafiuddin Ahmed, who took two wickets each. Bangladesh
captain Aminul Islam captured three wickets.
	   Rohan Selvaratnam was top scorer for Malaysia with 25 runs.
	   The Bangladesh batsmen kept their cool and scored the required
runs in 20 overs, losing two wickets.
	   Shahriar Hussain cracked a half century and was adjudged man of
the match. His attempt to hit a six brought his downfall as he was
caught near the boundary.
	   Bangladesh's captain Aminul Islam was chosen man of the series.
This was Bangladesh's second straight win against Malaysia in ACC
tournament final.

Third round of peace talks set to begin Tuesday afternoon

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The third round of talks aimed at
finding a peaceful solution to ethnic and political conflict in
Burundi was set to begin Tuesday afternoon with four topics on the
agenda, a spokesman for mediator Julius Nyerere said Monday.
	   Gen. Hashim Mbita said all the delegations and special envoys
Aldo Ajello of the European Commission and Howard Wolpe of the
United States had arrived, and the meeting would open formally at 4
p.m. (1300gmt).
	   On Monday there were reports that the government of President
Pierre Buyoya was considering a walkout if sanctions imposed by
neighboring countries two years ago when Buyoya seized power were
not lifted.
	   Sources close to former Tanzanian President Nyerere say he was
not keen on lifting the sanctions until he sees how Buyoya's
government performs at the latest round of talks, and Mbita said
discussion of sanctions was not on the agenda.
	   Subjects on the agenda included the adoption of general rules of
negotiation and the appointment of chairmen of committees that will
discuss the issues in the Burundi conflict.
	   Two others dealt with administrative points.
	   The Burundi government delegation rejected the proposal that
Nigerian Gen. Victor Mallu, who was in charge of a West African
peace-keeping force in Liberia, head the committee on peace and
security. No reason was given for the rejection.
	   For Etienne Karatasi, head of the preominantly Hutu Palipehutu
party, the peace and security committee would play a key role in
the negotiations.
	   ``When there is security for everyone, it will be possible to
arrive at appropriate solutions to other questions,'' he said.
	   The first round of all-party talks opened in June and was
followed by another in July when a cease-fire more or less took
hold in most of the country.
	   The sanctions were imposed to force Buyoya, a retired Tutsi
military officer who had previously served as president from 1987
to 1993, to return to a constitutional regime and begin talks with
Hutu rebels.
	   Buyoya claims those conditions have been met and that the
holding of the talks in which all major political parties and rebel
groups are represented is proof.
	   At least 200,000 people died since October 1993 when Tutsi
paratroopers assassinated Burundi's first democratically elected
president, Hutu Melchior Ndadaye.
	   There were initial widespread reprisals by majority Hutus
against minority Tutsis, but because the Tutsis control the army,
they seized the upper hand and drove many Hutus out of Bujumbura,
the capital and largest city in the tiny central African nation.
	   Buyoya said he intervened in July 1996 to stanch the bloodshed
after a coalition government was unable to control the situation.

Yeltsin stays home with respiratory infection
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with lawmaker calling for medical exam of Yeltsin.
TRIMS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin stayed home Tuesday,
nursing a respiratory infection that forced him to cut short a
foreign trip and revived concerns about his ability to govern.
	   Yeltsin was spending the day at his Gorky-9 country residence
just outside Moscow, and will probably not go into the office all
week, his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, told reporters.
	   However, Yeltsin's condition was stable, Yakushkin said.
	   Doctors insisted Monday that Yeltsin fly home from Central Asia
a day ahead of schedule because he was suffering from an upper
respiratory infection and had a mild fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3
F).
	   They said Yeltsin was being treated with antibiotics and there
were no plans to hospitalize him.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has a history of health problems, including
quintuple heart bypass surgery two years ago, so whenever he gets
sick there is a flurry of speculation about his ability to
function.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no major illness and plans to serve out
the remaining two years of his term. Yakushkin, his spokesman,
reiterated Tuesday there was no talk about an early resignation.
	   ``It's not being discussed,'' he said. ``I am personally against
such a resignation because I think it would only bring peril to the
nation.''
	   Yakushkin and other aides sought to play down the seriousness of
Yeltsin's illness.
	   ``Don't panic, Dad is OK,'' Yeltsin's daughter Tatiana
Dyachenko, who is his official image adviser, told the Kommersant
business newspaper.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin's personal doctor, Sergei Mironov,
confirmed that the president was suffering from a respiratory
infection known as tracheal bronchitis and that ``his condition is
stable.''
	   ``He must stay in bed like any other person,'' Yakushkin said.
``However, knowing the president's character, he is certain to
start working with documents and making phone calls to Russian
politicians as well as foreign leaders in view of the current
situation in Kosovo.''
	   But the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper said in a front-page
editorial Tuesday that Yeltsin's condition suggests he is suffering
from something worse than a cold.
	   It said his absence from the Kremlin during the current economic
crisis ``amounts to a state catastrophe'' and called on Yeltsin to
immediately surrender most of his powers to Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   A Communist lawmaker also called for ``an urgent medical check
... on the Russian president's health'' to determine whether he is
fit to remain in office, the Interfax news agency said.
	   ``Yeltsin's obvious inability to perform his functions is
damaging Russian state authority, as power is being misused by the
clique close to the president,'' said Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of
parliament's security committee.
	   The health of the president, who is also commander-in-chief of
the Russian military, ``is a direct threat to the country's
national security and a factor of serious concern regarding
Russia's nuclear weapons,'' he said.
	   Other newspapers gave a detailed description of Yeltsin's
weaknesses and his erratic behavior on the trip to the former
Soviet republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakstan _ his first foray
abroad since a visit to Britain in May.
	   The president appeared stiff and stumbled when he arrived Sunday
in Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent. He had to be supported by
Uzbek President Islam Karimov and canceled his other public events.
	   At a state dinner on Sunday, Yeltsin made rambling remarks,
expressing his satisfaction with local ``facilities and stores'' he
never inspected, the daily Kommersant reported.
	   On Monday, ``the president didn't seem to understand that he
wasn't in Moscow,'' Kommersant said, saying he called aides and
spoke as though they were late for work at the Kremlin.
	   He turned up more than an hour late for talks with Uzbek
officials, making some incoherent remarks interrupted by a bad
cough and abruptly cutting short a scheduled news conference.

	   VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) _ Defending champion Vijay Singh
received the top seed Wednesday for the World Match Play
Championship with Tiger Woods, Ernie Els and Mark O'Meara claiming
the next three seeded spots.
	   Play begins Thursday at the Wentworth Club south of London with
the eight non-seeded players facing off over 36 holes to reach the
quarterfinals. The four seeds have byes Thursday.
	   In Thursday play, Steve Stricker plays Patrick Sjoland with the
winner facing Singh on Friday. Colin Montgomerie faces Thomas Bjorn

	   In the other matchups, Lee Westwood is up against Stuart Appleby
with the winner facing Els, and Darren Clarke plays Ian Woosnam
with the winner playing Woods.
	   Woosnam was named as a late replacement for Bernhard Langer, who
was unable to play because of a chronic neck injury. Langer,
himself, was named last week to replace American Stewart Cink when
he withdrew.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally mixed
Tuesday, with prices slumping in Tokyo on profit-taking but surging
in the Philippines on the back of gains overnight on Wall Street.
	   Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 312.22 points, or
2.30 percent, closing at 13,242.79. On Monday, the Nikkei had
surged 675.04 points, or 5.24 percent.
	   Share prices fell on profit-taking after Monday's rally,
triggered by the passage of laws that will allow the government to
take over foundering banks to fix them or shut them down.
	   On Tuesday, Parliament's lower house passed a bill that will
allow the government to help banks boost their capital.
	   Traders are now waiting to see how the government might disburse
public funds to weak but viable banks.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 118.38 yen in late
afternoon, up 1.66 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its
late New York level of 117.63 yen overnight.
	   Philippine shares closed higher for the sixth straight session
in step with the hefty gains posted by Wall Street since last week.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 24.50 points,
or 1.8 percent, to 1,367.77.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed Monday's trading session
at 8,001.47 points, up 101.95, or 1.3 percent.
	   Indonesian shares also closed sharply higher, boosted by
government signals that its privatization program is moving ahead.
	   The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index rose 6.569 points,
or 2.1 percent, to 313.986.
	   Asian bourses and currencies have strengthened in recent
sessions as market players expect a fresh round of global interest
rate cuts and more joint efforts by industrialized nations to
restore international financial order.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower for the second straight day on
profit-taking. The market's key Weighted Price Index fell 11.23
points, or 0.16 percent, to 6,909.22.
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed generally higher in decreased
trading. The Hang Seng Index rose 18.56 points, or 0.2 percent,
closing at 9,008.83.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, with brokers
saying the local market took its cue from a sharp dip in domestic
interest rates and a sharp rise on Wall Street. The NZSE-40 Index
rose 32.19 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,755.84.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed broadly lower in
lackluster trading. The All Ordinaries Index fell 13.1 points, or
0.5 percent, to 2,488.5.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on a technical correction after
gains in the previous three sessions. The Korea Composite Stock
Price Index fell 6.09 points, or 1.7 percent, to 346.08.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed lower on a technical
correction. The Composite Index, which tracks prices of 100 key
stocks, fell 4.46 points, or 1.2 percent, to 385.04.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed slightly lower on profit-taking. The
benchmark Straits Times Index slipped 0.96 point to 1,015.64.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed mixed Tuesday. The Stock
Exchange of Thailand index slipped 0.61 points to 290.19.

Saddam's half brother has until November to leave Switzerland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Saddam Hussein's half brother, who
until recently was Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations in
Geneva, has until early November to leave Switzerland, an official
said Tuesday.
	   Barzan al-Tikriti was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and other
diplomats recalled to Baghdad over the summer in a major diplomatic
reshuffle ordered by the Iraqi president.
	   Under Swiss law, he has a ``diplomatic courtesy period'' of
three months before leaving the country, Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Monika Schmutz said.
	   That expires Nov. 5, al-Tikriti having personally informed
Vladimir Petrovsky, the head of the U.N. office in Geneva, on Aug.
5 that he was no longer ambassador.
	   Iraqi dissidents and Arab diplomats said last month al-Tikriti
had refused to return to Iraq after his diplomatic service ended.
	   Saddam immediately put under house arrest al-Tikriti's two
brothers _ Sabawi, a former security chief, and Watban, a former
interior minister _ following the defection, they said.
	   The dissidents said al-Tikriti informed Arab diplomats that he
refused to return because of his feud with Saddam's eldest son,
Odai, who has long been groomed as the Iraqi leader's successor.
	   But in an interview published Monday in the London-based Asharq
Al-Awsat, al-Tikriti was quoted as saying that he wanted to stay on
in Switzerland for family reasons.
	   He did not elaborate but his wife is believed to be suffering
from cancer and is being treated in the United States.
	   Saddam is aware of his domestic problem and his desire to stay
on in Switzerland, al-Tikriti added. He said once his family
problems are over he will return to Iraq to ``be there next to my
brother.''
	   ``We assume he is still in Switzerland,'' Schmutz said. But she
had no further information, she added.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three scientists working in the United
States won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for their discoveries
of how sub-atomic particles can behave like a fluid.
	   Robert C. Laughlin of the United States, Horst L. Stoermer of
Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a native of China who is now an
American citizen, will share the dlrs 978,000 prize.
	   They discovered that electrons acting together in strong
magnetic fields can form new types of particles, the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences said.
	   Laughlin works at Stanford University, Stoermer (pronounced
STER-mer) currently is at Columbia University in New York City and
Tsui (TSOO-ee) teaches at Princeton University. The award
recognizes work that Tsui and Stoermer did together in the 1980s,
which was elaborated on by Laughlin.
	   According to the citation, the three discovered a new form of
``quantum fluid,'' which are fluids such as liquid helium that have
certain properties in common such as superfluidity.
	   What makes these fluids important for researchers is that
``events in a drop of quantum fluid can afford more profound
insights into the general inner structure and dynamics of matter,''
the academy said.
	   It is ``yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics.''

Holbrooke says agreement may mark turning point

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on
Tuesday described the result of days of talks with Slobodan
Milosevic as a possible turning point in steps to end the Kosovo
crisis, but said it depends on the Yugoslav president.
	   Holbrooke made his remarks to a news conference just hours after
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced that the Yugoslav president
had promised to adhere to international demands.
	   ``I cannot stress too highly how deeply concerned we are about
what happened in the past few months in Kosovo ... the unnecessary
horror of it,'' Holbrooke said.
	   ``We hope this will mark a turning point in the right direction.
But the proof ... is in compliance with U.N. resolution 1199 and
with actions on the ground in Kosovo, regarding the deployment of
security forces, the return of refugees to their homes, the end of
armed violence on all sides, the repairing of the damage and in
some cases wanton destruction, and the creation most importantly of
a political process that gives the people of Kosovo autonomy and
self-determination.''
	   He said a statement to be made by Milosevic's government later
in the day would be critical in signifying their commitment to
settling the crisis.
	   The status of future talks was not immediately clear.
	   Holbrooke emphasized that the U.S. delegation was not
proclaiming the talks a victory, saying ``we're not out of the
emergency yet.''
	   ``But if this is the road past the end of the emergency, ...
then we will feel it was worth coming here, we will feel that
international solidarity helped end the crisis,'' he said.
	   ``Let's not call it a triumph ... until something was done that
was meaningful for the people of Kosovo.''
	   He indicated that the key was Milosevic having allowed a
verification force in Kosovo.
	   ``All I can say is, what we are talking about here is not words
... but compliance on the ground in Kosovo,'' he said.

Three researchers in America win Nobel Physics Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads to ADD details of discovery's significance. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three scientists working at
universities in the United States on Tuesday won the Nobel Physics
Prize for discovering that electrons on under certain circumstances
can form new kinds of particles.
	   The prize went to Robert C. Laughlin of the United States, Horst
L. Stoermer of Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a China-born American
citizen.
	   Laughlin is at Stanford University, Stoermer (pronounced
STER-mer) currently is at Columbia University in New York City and
Tsui (TSOO-ee) teaches at Princeton University.
	   The prize-winning work was done together by Tsui and Stoermer
and elaborated by Laughlin.
	   The prize recognizes work that leads to a scientific equivalent
of the mystic's desire to see the world in a grain of sand _ it
helps researchers discern the basic secrets of matter by examining
a drop of ``quantum fluid.''
	   According to the citation, the three discovered a new form of
``quantum fluid,'' which are fluids such as liquid helium that have
certain properties in common such as superfluidity.
	   What makes these fluids important for researchers is that
``events in a drop of quantum fluid can afford more profound
insights into the general inner structure and dynamics of matter,''
the academy said.
	   It is ''yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics.''
	   The 7.6-million-kronor (dlrs 978,000) prize will be divided
equally among the three.
	   The prize-winning work was done in the early 1980s. Since then,
the development of sophisticated microelectonics has allowed other
researchers to confirm the work's validity, in experiments that the
Academy likened to ''measuring the sound of individual hailstones
during a hailstorm.''
	   Last year's physics laureates, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of France
and William Phillips and Steven Chu of the United States, were
honored for developing ways of trapping atoms of gas and cooling
them to within a millionth of a degree of absolute zero.
	   The work led to developing extraordinarily accurate atomic
clocks. Previous atomic clocks weren't exactly sloppy, being
accurate to about one second in 32 million years _ but the
improvements made possible a clock that loses just one second every
3 billion years.
	   The 1997 chemistry winners, American Paul D. Boyer, John E.
Walker of Britain and Jens C. Skou of Denmark, discovered aspects
of how the body's cells store and use energy, a fundamental process
that affects everything from the building of bones to the
transmission of nerve impulses.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   Their finding helped lead to the discovery of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra and could also pay off in new treatments for heart
disease, cancer and septic shock.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago. The economics prize winner is to be named
on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
	   All the prizes are announced in Stockholm, except for the peace
prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes
in his will.

Parliament amends constitution to elect army chief as president

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's Parliament on Tuesday ratified
a constitutional amendment to clear the way for the election of the
army's commander, Gen. Emile Lahoud, as president.
	   Lahoud has received the backing of Syria, the main power broker
in the country, making the election by Lebanon's pro-Syrian
Parliament later this week just a formality.
	   A total of 113 deputies voted for the amendment and four
deputies against, including the general's cousin, Nassib Lahoud, a
presidential aspirant. Eleven deputies were absent.
	   Among those who were absent was Walid Jumblatt, a Cabinet
minister who had said he would boycott the session to protest the
choice of a military man even though Lahoud has wide public and
political support.
	   The 128-member legislature is expected to meet Thursday to elect
Lahoud after outgoing President Elias Hrawi signs the
constitutional amendment.
	   The amendment to Article 49 of the constitution revokes a ban on
senior civil servants from running for the presidency.
	   The new president will be sworn in Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves
office. Hrawi has served for nine years, including a three-year
extension in 1995 to his six-year term.
	   Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will keep alive a 55-year-old
tradition under which the president is a Maronite, the prime
minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim.
	   Lahoud, appointed army commander in 1989 amid a rebellion in the
fractured military during the 1975-90 civil war, is credited with
rebuilding the 55,000-strong Lebanese army and in ending the reign
of militias.
	   Many hope he will copy his success with the military in the
government, which is plagued by nepotism and waste of public funds.
But some fear of military dominance of public life.

	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index closed up 24.50
points, or 1.8 percent, at 1,367.77, adding to its 41.91-point gain
the previous day.
	   Tuesday's gains brought the index's total gain to 201.23 points,
or 17 percent, since Oct. 6.
	   Edwin Siao, a trader for institutional sales at Abacus
Securities Corp., said Tuesday's advance can be credited to the
steady performance of the local currency and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average's 101.95-point surge Monday to 8,001.47,
following a 167.61-point gain Friday.
	   The peso ended slightly weaker Tuesday, weighed down by the
weaker Japanese yen and brisk demand for the U.S. currency from
banks that oversold dollars in previous sessions, traders said.
	   At the close of Tuesday's trading, the dollar averaged 43.133
pesos, up from Monday's average of 43.018 pesos. It was last traded
at 43.190 pesos.
	   The dollar, however, has not been subject to any wild swings so
far, trading between 43 pesos and 43.19 pesos.
	   Traders said recent gains by the Japanese yen against the dollar
had enabled the peso to hold its own against the U.S. currency.
	   ``Overall sentiment in the region has improved considerably.
Foreign funds are actually buying stocks in the region. But the
question is what time frame are these investors looking at,'' said
Siao.
	   Also aiding the market Tuesday was the decline in treasury bill
yields at Monday's weekly auction, he added.
	   The average 91-day yield, used by banks in setting lending
rates, fell to 13.489 percent from the previous 13.793 percent,
paving the way for further interest rate declines.
	   Lower interest rates help shift funds from fixed-income
instruments to other types of investments like equities, traders
said.
	   Lower lending rates would also provide businesses with cheaper
capital, thus ensuring some level of economic activity despite the
current regional financial crisis, said Siao.
	   The market, however, may already be at the end of its rally,
having posted gains for six straight trading days, he said.
	   Some profit-taking was already evident at midsession Tuesday,
though this provided investors eager to enter the market the
opportunity to buy stocks, said Siao.

Saddam's half brother has until November to leave Switzerland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Saddam Hussein's half brother, who
until recently was Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations in
Geneva, has until early November to leave Switzerland, an official
said Tuesday.
	   Barzan al-Tikriti was among 30 Iraqi ambassadors and other
diplomats recalled to Baghdad over the summer in a major diplomatic
reshuffle ordered by the Iraqi president.
	   Under Swiss law, he has a ``diplomatic courtesy period'' of
three months before leaving the country, Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Monika Schmutz said.
	   That expires Nov. 5. Al-Tikriti personally informed Vladimir
Petrovsky, the head of the U.N. office in Geneva, on Aug. 5 that he
was no longer ambassador.
	   Iraqi dissidents and Arab diplomats said last month al-Tikriti
had refused to return to Iraq after his diplomatic service ended.
	   Saddam immediately put under house arrest al-Tikriti's two
brothers _ Sabawi, a former security chief, and Watban, a former
interior minister _ following the defection, they said.
	   The dissidents said al-Tikriti informed Arab diplomats that he
refused to return because of his feud with Saddam's eldest son,
Odai, who has long been groomed as the Iraqi leader's successor.
	   But in an interview published Monday in the London-based Asharq
Al-Awsat, al-Tikriti was quoted as saying that he wanted to stay on
in Switzerland for family reasons.
	   He did not elaborate, but his wife is believed to be suffering
from cancer and is being treated in the United States.
	   Saddam is aware of his domestic problem and his desire to stay
on in Switzerland, al-Tikriti added. He said once his family
problems are over he will return to Iraq to ``be there next to my
brother.''
	   ``We assume he is still in Switzerland,'' Schmutz said. But she
had no further information, she added.

Farmers using sheep to get cheap ferry trips
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OBAN, Scotland (AP) _ Some residents of the Hebridean Islands
off the west coast of Scotland have found the secret of cheap
vacations _ travel with sheep.
	   Ever since the ferry company Caldonian MacBraynea introduced
discounted fares for farmers taking their livestock to market, some
vacationers crossing to the mainland have packed sheep along with
their suntan lotion and passports, the company says.
	   Throughout the summer, members of the ferry staff say they were
puzzled by the number of sheep traveling in cars filled with
bulging suitcases.
	   After monitoring a succession of farmers who returned weeks
later with a suntan and a woeful tale of beasts that couldn't be
sold at market, the ferry company realized it had stumbled on a
scam that saved islanders more than 100 pounds (dlrs 170) a
journey.
	   After paying 2.35 pounds (dlrs 4) per sheep with no extra
charges, the drivers left the animals in the care of cooperative
farmers on the mainland before heading off on vacation.
	   The discounts were introduced in April to help farmers on the
islands of Uist, Barra, Mull and Colonsay, who transport their
livestock to market in Oban, 60 miles northwest of Glasgow.
	   ``Because of what would appear to be abuse by a very small
number of people in these islands, the company is going to have
look again at how it works,'' Cal-Mac spokesman Stewart Riddell
said of the discount.

Official: Russia's space program gets only half of funds it needs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's space program needs 3 billion rubles
(dlrs 190 million) each year, but the cash-strapped government has
allocated less than half of the money in this year's budget, a top
official said Tuesday.
	   The lack of funds, which has caused repeated delays in Russia's
share of constructing the international space station, threatens
the future of Russia's manned space program, said the chief of the
Russian Space Agency, Yuri Koptev.
	   This year's budget allocates 1.2 billion rubles (dlrs 75
million) for space programs, Koptev said, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   Even this money has not been paid on time. The government still
owes the space agency dlrs 44.5 million, which it has promised to
pay before the end of the year.
	   To raise money to complete a long-delayed component of the
international space station, the space agency has offered to sell
its research time on the international station to NASA for dlrs 60
million.

Beijing welcomes talks with Taiwan, insists on reunification
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Talks this week between top Taiwan and mainland
negotiators could help improve the atmosphere for relations between
the two sides, although China has no surprise changes in its
position on reunification, a government spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Koo Chen-fu, Taiwan's top negotiator with China, will make a
watershed visit to the mainland beginning Wednesday in Shanghai,
where he will meet with his mainland counterpart, Wang Daohan.
	   Koo and Wang met for the first _ and last _ time in 1993 in
Singapore. Beijing broke off high-level talks in 1995 in anger over
Taiwan's drive for greater international recognition.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang reiterated Beijing's
position that there is only one China, and Taiwan is part of it.
Beijing's goal is peaceful reunification under a ``one country, two
systems'' formula that would allow Taiwan to maintain its
capitalist lifestyle, Tang said.
	   But Beijing will not renounce the right to use force if
necessary, he added at a regular briefing.
	   The talks this week will be a ``major event'' in relations
between the two sides, Tang said. Beijing hopes they will improve
the atmosphere and pave the way for holding political negotiations
soon, he said.
	   Taiwan wants talks on practical issues first, such as the
resolution of fishing disputes.
	   The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which
China signed last week, guarantees the right to self-determination.
But Tang said that did not give Taiwan the right to choose
independence.
	   ``Self-determination cannot be interpreted as allowing or
encouraging the activities aimed at splitting the territorial
integrity of a sovereign state,'' he said.
	   The mainland and Taiwan have been divided since 1949, when the
Nationalists retreated to the island after they lost a civil war to
the Communists on the mainland.

Indonesian army patrols as mysterious murder spree spreads

<TEXT>
	   BANYUWANGI, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military chief ordered
troops Tuesday to patrol fear-stricken villages and towns amid
reports that a mysterious murder wave is spreading against Muslim
clergy and those accused of practicing black magic.
	   Armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto said small squads of
soldiers were being assigned across East Java province.
	   National police chief Lt. Gen. Rusmanhadi said 153 people have
been slain in the past three months.
	   Many had been stabbed or had their throats slashed. Some bodies
had been mutilated and hung from trees.
	   Witnesses claim assassins dressed in black attack people in
their homes at night.
	   Many have been slain in and around Banyuwangi, about 830
kilometers (520 miles) east of Jakarta, the capital.
	   An atmosphere of fear has descended upon the city of 1.5 million
people.
	   At night, local men armed with swords, sickles and sticks patrol
its otherwise deserted streets.
	   Dozens of Muslim clergy and others, fearing they might be the
next targets, shelter under police protection.
	   The houses of prominent Muslim figures are guarded every night
by worried neighbors.
	   ``It's like a war situation here,'' said Hadi Sucipto, one of
dozens of vigilantes who walk the town's streets every night.
	   ``We have to be alert. The killers could attack us at any
time.''
	   Many of the dead belonged to the 30 million-member Nahdlatul
Ulama, Indonesia's largest Muslim organization, which recently set
up its own political party.
	   Other victims were reportedly sorcerers who dabbled in black
magic that predates the arrival of Islam in Indonesia hundreds of
years ago.
	   Rusmanhadi said 169 suspects have been arrested. At least 21
people have been charged in the slayings, but police say they have
yet to establish a clear motive.
	   ``The groups (of soldiers) will teach local people how to look
after their own security,'' Wiranto said after a meeting with
President B.J. Habibie.
	   The newspaper Kompas reported that a Muslim preacher, identified
by the single name of Rahmadi, was tortured to death by neighbors
in Donoredjo village in neighboring Central Java province.
	   The paper said villagers accused him of being a sorcerer.
	   Police arrested three suspects. This triggered a protest by
dozens of people.
	   ``If police want to arrest suspects then all of us should be
arrested,'' one villager was quoted as saying.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic state.
	   The murders have been committed as Indonesia endures political
and economic turmoil amid the worst financial crisis in 30 years.
	   Poverty and food shortages are spreading.

determination to protect the country's territorial integrity and
sovereignty,'' the statement said.
	   It said the talks centered on the verification process, and that
it was agreed that this should be carried by a mission from the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   ``Yugoslavia expects that (the mission) will eliminate false,
untrue and malicious reports about the situation in Kosovo.''
	   The statement said the ``constructive approach'' to the issue of
the political dialogue on Kosovo ``could represent the basis for
the permanent political solution of the autonomy of Kosovo within
Serbia, in the principle of equality of'' all people who live
there.

Thousands of students again take to streets in dozen cities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Galvanized by a national show of force, high school
students again took to the streets across France Tuesday to protest
crowded classes and to demand better education tools.
	   Police said 16,000 students rallied in downtown Bordeaux,
southwestern France, causing major traffic disruption. The students
held aloft banners, many saying ``Mobilization. Action for Good
Conditions.''
	   Similar protests took place in a dozen cities: 10,000 students
rallied in Rennes, northwest France, and a few thousand in smaller
towns such as Clermont-Ferrand, in central France.
	   Everywhere, police said the show of force appeared stronger than
on Monday, when tens of thousands of students protested nationwide,
including the capital.
	   Students, who began the school year in early September, warn
they will stay off school and continue their protests unless the
government comes up with funds to solve overcrowded classrooms, and
provide better equipment, such as computers.
	   On Monday, protests were held in more than a dozen cities. Ten
thousand students were mobilized in Paris, at least 8,000 in
Bordeaux and 7,000 in Toulouse.
	   In Paris, two police officers were injured and 13 others
arrested after violence broke out in shopping centers and avenues,
authorities said. Six cars were damaged and the windows of several
stores and phone booths were broken.
	   On Wednesday, five of those arrested remained in custody.
	   Elsewhere, baseball bat-wielding students smashed windows and
overturned cars.
	   Late Monday, a student delegation met at the Education Ministry
with Bernard Toulemonde, director of scholastic instruction. He
reminded the group that the government had already announced the
creation of 3,000 new posts for teachers for next year and 20,000
student jobs.

Russia to expand role of foreign banks

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to CORRECT lead sequence &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with oil exports up, minor editing. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov promised Tuesday
to expand the role of foreign banks in Russia, and said his
government has no plans to nationalize domestic banks, not even
those on the verge of bankruptcy.
	   Primakov also said during a meeting with two dozen of Russia's
biggest banks that between dlrs 1.5 and dlrs 2 billion has been
sent out of the country, some of it illegally, since the latest
economic crisis struck in mid-August.
	   The Central Bank recently said more than that was stashed abroad
in September alone.
	   No details were released of Primakov's plans for foreign banks,
which are currently not allowed to provide retail services in
Russia. All the major international banks have offices in Russia,
devoted mostly to corporate and investment services.
	   ``We cannot manage without expanding opportunities for foreign
banks in Russia, without the expansion of foreign capital in assets
of Russian banks,'' Primakov said, in remarks broadcast on national
television.
	   The Russian media have given varied accounts of how the
government is likely to respond to the banking crisis.
	   Some reports have said the government is considering
nationalizing the country's leading banks, while other reports said
the government will seek only to rescue ailing banks, and will
leave them in private hands.
	   Some commercial banks have failed, and most have frozen accounts
or allow only limited transactions. The banks regularly run out of
rubles and foreign currencies sought by customers.
	   Clients of six major private banks have been advised to transfer
their accounts to the state savings bank, where they would be
guaranteed. Any savings in foreign currencies would, however, be
converted into rubles at an unfavorable rate.
	   Primakov said the lack of plans to nationalize banks does not
mean the government will rescue all those in trouble. ``Our goal
isn't to save all banks,'' he said.
	   The government says it plans to make public its proposals to
overcome the crisis by Oct. 20. However, it acknowledges these will
be mostly stop-gap measures rather than a comprehensive, long-term
plan.
	   The government's fourth-quarter budget will also be made public
next week. Primakov says the budget depends on the International
Monetary Fund releasing frozen installments in a dlrs 22.6 billion
bailout package negotiated before the crisis hit.
	   The IMF says it wants to see details of the government's
economic plan, plus signs it has been implemented, before it will
release more money. An IMF delegation is expected to return to
Moscow next week.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced that crude oil exports
soared to 84.78 million metric tons (93.25 million short tons) in
the first eight months of 1998, up 10 percent over the same period
last year.
	   With world oil prices at their lowest level in a decade,
however, revenue fell 28 percent from last year to dlrs 6.68
billion, the State Statistics Committee said.
	   Russia had promised to cut oil exports in an effort to stabilize
world prices.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Warning of the risks of global recession,
participants in the private East Asia Economic Summit adopted an
action plan Tuesday for economic growth and reform of the world
financial system.
	   The meeting of economists, businessmen and government officials
urged the West to make significant cuts in interest rates and urged
Japan to expand its money supply.
	   The plan also calls on members of the Group of Seven major
industrial nations to establish a new regime for the monitoring,
disclosure and regulation of highly leveraged short-term financial
flows, as well as off-balance-sheet commitments and derivative
transactions.
	   Participants at the summit organized by the World Economic
Forum, a private agency based in Switzerland, said they were
``deeply concerned about the drift of the world economy and
financial markets, and the growing risk of global recession.''
	   The 15-point plan was put together by forum officials in
consultation with speakers at the conference and other
participants, and incorporates many of the themes brought up during
the first two days of the conference, a spokeswoman said.
	   ``Japan, as Asia's major high-income economy, with a GNP twice
as large as all of the rest of Asia combined, has a special
responsibility to help the region emerge from its current deep
recession,'' they said in a statement.
	   Expressing their support for Japan's plan to provide dlrs 30
billion in assistance to crisis-stricken East Asia, the
participants said Japan should be prepared to increase that sum,
``perhaps significantly.''
	   Europe, Canada and the United States should adopt significant
tax cuts, and expand the provision of official loans and credit
guarantees to the emerging markets in crisis, especially to cover
necessities like food, energy and medical supplies, they added.
	   The plan also called on East Asian countries to remain committed
to further openness to foreign direct investment, and work to
achieve greater transparency in conducting business.
	   Commenting on what kind of new rules are sought for financial
markets, the forum's managing director, Claude Smadja, said the aim
was to curb ``elements like volatile short-term financial flows and
off-balance-sheet transactions.''
	   These elements, Smadja said, ``generate a lack of transparency
and aggravate volatility of the financial market.... It's like a
time bomb waiting to explode.''
	   ``Of course, we can just crystallize options,'' Smadja said. He
added he believed governments and financial bodies would take in
the action plan because of the growing frustration and anxiety over
financial deals worldwide.
	   Many at the gloomy conference have complained of a lack of
leadership in dealing with economic crisis, and of slow recovery,
delayed by political instability.
	   ``In a severe crisis, countries, like individuals, become
preoccupied with survival and become more self-centered and
selfish,'' George Yeo, Singapore's second minister for trade and
industry, told the meeting.
	   Thailand's deputy prime minister, Supachai Panitchpakdi, said
the protectionist trend, coupled with a contraction of export
markets as economies slow down worldwide, could hamstring the Asian
recovery.
	   Almost everyone agrees on the restructuring that the crisis-hit
Asian nations need to save themselves and stem the contagion, said
Hubert Neiss, the International Monetary Fund's Asia-Pacific
director.
	   But the dilemma is that the policy changes require strong
political courage at a time when the economic changes themselves
cause people to doubt their governments.
	   Balance sheets must be cleared of bad loans, insolvent banks
closed, weak ones recapitalized, fiscal policy refocused on
projects that encourage investment and create jobs, and social
safety nets erected in Asian countries that did not have them
before, Neiss said.
	   ``This shift in fiscal policy has resulted in substantial
deficits in most'' of the crisis-hit countries, he said. ``These
restructurings ... are very difficult to implement and are
politically charged.''
	   Neiss predicted the Asian crisis would bottom out in the first
half of next year, and that the recovery would begin by the end of
1999.

British inflation rate hits government target for second month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British inflation held steady at 2.5 percent in
September, hitting the Labor Party government's target for the
second consecutive month, officials said Tuesday.
	   The 2.5 percent rate in August and September was down from an
annual rate of 2.6 percent in July, 2.8 percent in June and 3.2
percent in May, the Office of National Statistics reported.
	   The news will increase the pressure on the Bank of England to
cut interest rates again next month following last week's 0.25
percent reduction.
	   World stock markets soared Monday partly on the hope of
interest-rate cuts in leading economies, with the London FTSE-100
Index of leading shares posting its biggest ever daily points gain.
The market closed up 214.2 points at 5,037.6.
	   And government figures showed the annual rise in prices of goods
at the factory gate _ a good indicator of future retail price
inflation rates _ were at their lowest levels since 1960.
	   Manufacturers have come under increasing pressure to cut prices
as cheap foreign goods have flooded into the United Kingdom on the
back of the strong pound, the data showed.

Three researchers in America win Nobel Physics Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to ADD winners' ages, Laughlin comment. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three scientists working at
universities in the United States on Tuesday won the Nobel Physics
Prize for discovering that electrons on under certain circumstances
can form new kinds of particles.
	   The prize went to Robert C. Laughlin of the United States, Horst
L. Stoermer of Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a China-born American
citizen.
	   Like many of the Nobel science prizes, this year's award is for
work that is in the rarefied atmosphere of high theory but that
deals with fundamental questions.
	   ``The reason this is important is it has to do with big issues,
why the universe is the way it is,'' Laughlin, 47, of Stanford
University, told The AP by phone as he was having coffee with his
wife at home.
	   Stoermer (pronounced STER-mer), 49, currently is at Columbia
University in New York City and Tsui (TSOO-ee), 59, teaches at
Princeton University.
	   The prize-winning work was done together by Tsui and Stoermer
and elaborated by Laughlin.
	   This year's award recognizes work that leads to a scientific
equivalent of the mystic's desire to see the world in a grain of
sand _ it helps researchers discern the basic secrets of matter by
examining a drop of ``quantum fluid.''
	   According to the citation, the three discovered a new form of
``quantum fluid,'' which are fluids such as liquid helium that have
certain properties in common such as superfluidity.
	   What makes these fluids important for researchers is that
``events in a drop of quantum fluid can afford more profound
insights into the general inner structure and dynamics of matter,''
the academy said.
	   It is ``yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics,'' the citation
said.
	   The 7.6-million-kronor (dlrs 978,000) prize will be divided
equally among the three.
	   The prize-winning work was done in the early 1980s. Since then,
the development of sophisticated microelectonics has allowed other
researchers to confirm the work's validity, in experiments that the
Academy likened to ``measuring the sound of individual hailstones
during a hailstorm.''
	   Last year's physics laureates, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of France
and William Phillips and Steven Chu of the United States, were
honored for developing ways of trapping atoms of gas and cooling
them to within a millionth of a degree of absolute zero.
	   The work led to developing extraordinarily accurate atomic
clocks. Previous atomic clocks weren't exactly sloppy, being
accurate to about one second in 32 million years _ but the
improvements made possible a clock that loses just one second every
3 billion years.
	   The 1997 chemistry winners, American Paul D. Boyer, John E.
Walker of Britain and Jens C. Skou of Denmark, discovered aspects
of how the body's cells store and use energy, a fundamental process
that affects everything from the building of bones to the
transmission of nerve impulses.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   Their finding helped lead to the discovery of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra and could also pay off in new treatments for heart
disease, cancer and septic shock.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago. The economics prize winner is to be named
on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
	   All the prizes are announced in Stockholm, except for the peace
prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes
in his will.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke wrapped
up marathon talks with President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday,
hailing their agreement as an apparent turning point in efforts to
end the Kosovo crisis. But he warned that ``we're not out of the
emergency yet,'' saying it's up to Milosevic's government to prove
its commitment to the agreement, which was expected to be signed
later. Milosevic's government had no immediate statement on the
outcome of days of talks. Holbrooke made his remarks to a news
conference just hours after President Clinton announced that the
Yugoslav president had promised to adhere to international demands.
``I cannot stress too highly how deeply concerned we are about what
happened in the past few months in Kosovo ... the unnecessary
horror of it,'' Holbrooke said. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin stayed home Tuesday,
nursing a respiratory infection that forced him to cut short a
foreign trip and revived concerns about his ability to govern.
Yeltsin was spending the day at his Gorky-9 country residence just
outside Moscow, and will probably not go into the office all week,
his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, told reporters. However, Yeltsin's
condition was stable, Yakushkin said. Doctors insisted Monday that
Yeltsin fly home from Central Asia a day ahead of schedule because
he was suffering from an upper respiratory infection and had a mild
fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3 F). They said Yeltsin was being treated
with antibiotics and there were no plans to hospitalize him.

	   KINDU, Congo (AP) _ Victorious Congolese rebels patrolled the
town of Kindu on the Congo River Tuesday after defeating 5,000
government troops in an eight-day battle that stopped a major
counteroffensive by forces loyal to President Laurent Kabila.
Thousands of exhausted but triumphant rebel troops carrying
Kalashnikov rifles, mortars and rocket-launchers lounged on both
banks of the wide, muddy river that runs through Kindu. The rebel
victory will open routes to the diamond-rich province of Eastern
Kasai and its capital, Mbuji-Mayi, as well as to southern,
mineral-rich Katanga Province, Kabila's home. ``This is a big
victory for us,'' said Arthur Mulunda, a rebel commander. ``Kabila
wanted to use Kindu for a big counteroffensive. He cannot do
anything now. Mbuji-Mayi is next.'' (CONGO)
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three scientists working in the United
States won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for their discoveries
of how sub-atomic particles can behave like a fluid. Robert C.
Laughlin of the United States, Horst L. Stoermer of Germany and
Daniel C. Tsui, a native of China who is now an American citizen,
will share the dlrs 978,000 prize. They discovered that electrons
acting together in strong magnetic fields can form new types of
particles, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. Laughlin
works at Stanford University, Stoermer (pronounced STER-mer)
currently is at Columbia University in New York City and Tsui
(TSOO-ee) teaches at Princeton University. The award recognizes
work that Tsui and Stoermer did together in the 1980s, which was

move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed generally mixed
Tuesday, with prices slumping in Tokyo on profit-taking but surging
in the Philippines on the back of gains overnight on Wall Street.
Tokyo's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 312.22 points, or 2.30
percent, closing at 13,242.79. On Monday, the Nikkei had surged
675.04 points, or 5.24 percent. Share prices fell on profit-taking
after Monday's rally, triggered by the passage of laws that will
allow the government to take over foundering banks to fix them or
shut them down. On Tuesday, Parliament's lower house passed a bill
that will allow the government to help banks boost their capital.
Traders are now waiting to see how the government might disburse
public funds to weak but viable banks. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Asian financial crisis now is threatening
Singapore's social cohesion as well as its economy, the deputy
prime minister said Tuesday. ``This is not just an economic
problem; it is also a challenge to our social cohesion and our
resolve to survive and thrive as a nation,'' Lee Hsien Loong told a
group of business people in Hong Kong. The crisis and the
relatively small depreciation of the Singapore dollar are forcing
businesses to cut costs, especially wage costs, Lee said. ``Wages
make up 40 percent of costs,'' he said. ``In the crisis, the
exchange rates of many countries have fallen sharply, but their
nominal wages have not gone up to compensate. We therefore need to
reduce wage costs significantly.'' Layoffs are approaching high
levels not seen since the last recession in 1985-86, and the
minority ethnic Malay population has suffered the brunt of the
cuts. Unemployment has reached 3.2 percent. (HONG KONG-SINGAPORE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov promised Tuesday
to expand the role of foreign banks in Russia, and said his
government has no plans to nationalize domestic banks, not even
those on the verge of bankruptcy. Primakov also said during a
meeting with two dozen of Russia's biggest banks that between dlrs
1.5 and dlrs 2 billion has been sent out of the country, some of it
illegally, since the latest economic crisis struck in mid-August.
The Central Bank recently said more than that was stashed abroad in
September alone. No details were released of Primakov's plans for
foreign banks, which are currently not allowed to provide retail
services in Russia. All the major international banks have offices
in Russia, devoted mostly to corporate and investment services.
``We cannot manage without expanding opportunities for foreign
banks in Russia, without the expansion of foreign capital in assets
of Russian banks,'' Primakov said, in remarks broadcast on national
television. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ The global economic environment
appears to be moving towards deflation and News Corp. was bracing
for a significant downturn in world markets, media magnate Rupert
Murdoch said Tuesday. Addressing the annual general meeting of his
News Corp. Ltd., company chief executive Murdoch said there had
been substantial shocks to the world's financial systems and there
may be more to come in the next few months. ``We seem to be moving
to a period of deflation,'' he told shareholders. Murdoch said News
Corp. was not planning any significant acquisitions as it braces
for a significant downturn in world markets, and that the company
would remain cashed up amid the market volatility. Murdoch said
News Corp. had positioned itself earlier this year by refinancing
from short-term debt to long-term debt. He noted that the company
had no significant repayments over the next five years.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Exports from Southeast Asian countries have
slowed since the start of the region's financial crisis,
confounding hopes that their currency devaluations would allow them
to export their way out of the turmoil, officials said Tuesday.
``It's been more than a year since the devaluations,'' said Rodolfo
Severino, secretary general of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations. ``There has been no export response from the ASEAN
countries. Quite the contrary.'' Normally, a lower exchange rate
would make a nation's products more competitive overseas. Many
economists had predicted that the sharp currency devaluations that
resulted from the crisis, which hit in July 1997, would create an
export surge as the countries attempted to recover economically.
But Severino and other officials attending an East Asia Economic
Summit said a shortage of credit caused by banking problems, weak
worldwide demand, and heavy loan burdens among producers had
thwarted export hopes. (ASIA-TRADE)
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Their economies struggling, Russia
and other former Soviet states may reject international moves to
free agricultural trade and return to policies of protectionism, a
specialist in agriculture in the region warned Tuesday.
Agricultural economist Csaba Csaski of Budapest University told the
45th World Food Production conference that agriculture industries
in central and eastern European were in a rut with their often rich
resources underutilized. But while some countries in the region
were showing signs of recovery in the agricultural sector, the
situation was very different in former states of the Soviet Union.
Demands were increasing for protection of internal agricultural
markets in the Commonwealth of Independent States, a confederation
of many ex-Soviet republics, and Russia. ``They see imports as one
of the constraints to complete the reform transition, therefore
there is a significant pressure from the farming side to increase
trade barriers and become more protectionist,'' Csaski said.

Chinese dissident injured in street attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A dissident based in northeastern China's
Liaoning province suffered severe head injuries when he was beaten
by two men who attacked him as he was trying to catch a train, a
human rights group reported Tuesday.
	   Yang Chunguang, a poet and editor for a literary journal, was
rushing to catch a 4 a.m. train Sunday when he was assaulted under
a railway bridge in the Liaoning city of Liaoyang, the Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China reported.
	   According to the Hong Kong-based human rights group and accounts
by fellow dissidents, the two men called out Yang's name before
beating him over the head with a police baton.
	   The attackers were quoted as saying, ``We'll kill you,'' ``We'll
teach you a lesson.'' After knocking Yang down twice, they left him
for dead, the accounts said.
	   Since his attackers knew his name and where he would be at such
an odd hour, Yang believed the assault was related to his political
activities, the reports said.
	   The attackers told Yang they did not want money, although after
beating him they took his bag containing all his identification
cards, credit cards and money, the reports added.
	   Yang received more than 50 stitches to his head at an emergency
clinic. Having lost a large amount of blood, he was not yet out of
danger, the human rights group said.
	   According to the group, Yang was imprisoned for 1 1/2 years and
discharged from the army after writing essays criticizing the
government's 1989 violent suppression of pro-democracy protests, in
which hundreds, perhaps thousands died. He had been visiting family
and friends in Liaoning when the attack occurred.

Police reportedly detain four pro-Islamic journalists, activists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's secular establishment has hit
back at the Islamic movement, arresting leading pro-Islamic
journalists and scores of protesters for participating in a
nationwide demonstration against a head scarf ban, a newspaper
official said Tuesday.
	   Four journalists were detained late Monday on charges of
supporting and organizing an illegal demonstration, Nazif Karaman
of the newspaper Akit said.
	   Some 30 protesters were also arrested Monday, he said. Police
refused to comment.
	   Turkey is a predominantly Muslim country governed by staunchly
pro-secular laws, which the Islamic movement describes as
undemocratic.
	   Thousands of demonstrators joined hands and marched through
towns and cities Sunday to protest the ban on the Islamic-style
head scarves in schools and public offices.
	   The dean of medical school in the eastern city of Van was
dismissed for attending the march, the daily Hurriyet reported.
	   It was the largest demonstration against the ban since
universities last month refused to register women who failed to
submit identity photographs with bare heads.

Russia to send parliamentary delegation to Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's parliament voted Tuesday to send an
urgent delegation to the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, and its
speaker urged fellow Slavic neighbors to do the same thing.
	   The four-member delegation will leave Wednesday and stay in
Kosovo until NATO lifts the threat of airstrikes, said Sergei
Baburin, the deputy speaker of the State Duma lower house of
parliament who will lead the expedition.
	   He said the purpose of the trip was to study the situation in
Kosovo and visit ``a number of sites'' that NATO was likely to
target, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said ``it would be good if our
colleagues, friends and allies, deputies from Belarus or Ukraine,
would also send their people.''
	   ``We are all Slavs, and this question must be resolved by us
together,'' Seleznyov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Russia opposes possible NATO airstrikes against Serbia, which
makes up most of present-day Yugoslavia. Russia and Serbia are
allies, both being Slavic countries that practice the Orthodox
religion.
	   Ukraine has offered to help mediate a peaceful solution to the
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, while Belarus has offered
military aid to Yugoslavia in the event it is targeted by NATO.
	   Russia's Movement for Support of the Armed Forces, a political
group formed to push for President Boris Yeltsin's ouster, said it
was ready to send its members to Yugoslavia to organize resistance
to NATO.
	   ``In view of the growing anti-NATO and anti-American mood in
Russia, it is impossible to guarantee that no hostile acts will be
carried out against diplomats and other representatives of NATO
member states working in Moscow,'' said Viktor Ilyukhin, who leads
the movement as well as parliament's security committee.
	   Meanwhile, a Russian general warned that if NATO strikes at
Yugoslavia, other European countries, including Russia, ``may
become the next targets,'' Interfax reported.
	   It did not say how Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head of the Russian
Defense Ministry's main department for international military
cooperation, arrived at this conclusion. But it indicated the depth
of Russian opposition to the plans.
	   Ivashov said the proposed airstrikes ``reflect NATO's desire to
assert itself as an authoritarian agency tackling security problems
in Europe without consulting the United Nations and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.''

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke wrapped
up week-long talks with President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday and
proclaimed a breakthrough in efforts to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   But, he warned, ``we're not out of the emergency yet.'' He said
it's up to Milosevic's government to prove its commitment to
international demands it has agreed to honor _ especially on
allowing an international verification force of 2,000 people into
the Serbian province.
	   Appearing on national television, Milosevic declared that the
agreements ``avert the danger of a military intervention against
our country.''
	   The end of more than a week of intensive talks capped a dramatic
series of developments to force an end to Milosevic's crackdown
against ethnic Albanian separatists in the southern Serbian
province of Kosovo.
	   In rapid succession, NATO formally moved to the verge of
airstrikes and U.S. President Bill Clinton announced key
concessions by Milosevic.
	   Milosevic issued a statement saying the agreement demonstrated
his government's commitment to the peace process, but also
reflected his position that the demands are unwarranted.
	   ``The steps which our country is taking to solve the Kosovo
problems by peaceful means show our firm commitment that all
questions can be solved by political means, but also the
determination to protect the country's territorial integrity and
sovereignty,'' the statement said.
	   Since the crackdown began Feb. 28, Milosevic has insisted the
crisis was an internal matter in which foreign powers should play
no role. The crackdown was aimed at crushing the Kosovo Liberation
Army, fighting for independence of the majority Albanian province,
which is a part of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   Yugoslavia expects that the verification mission, to be led by
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ``will
eliminate false, untrue and malicious reports about the situation
in Kosovo,'' he said.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo and hundreds of
thousands of people have been forced from their homes during the
seven-month operation.
	   International leaders stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis
because of fears that thousands of homeless refugees would die if
they could not return to their homes by the time winter sets in.
	   To make sure Milosevic abides by the agreement, NATO agreed
early Tuesday on the final step needed to authorize airstrikes. The
16-nation alliance set a four-day deadline for Milosevic to begin
complying with international demands.
	   Holbrooke returned immediately afterward to Belgrade and met
briefly with Milosevic for the eighth time in nine days.
	   ``We hope this will mark a turning point in the right direction.
But the proof ... is in compliance with U.N. resolution 1199 and
with actions on the ground in Kosovo,'' the U.S. trouble-shooter
told a news conference before planning to head for New York.
	   NATO took its decision after Holbrooke flew to alliance
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, to brief ambassadors on his
talks with Milosevic.
	   Clinton announced shortly afterward that Milosevic had agreed to
withdraw his forces from Kosovo, initiate autonomy negotiations
with the separatist ethnic Albanians and allow the verification
force to ensure U.N. demands are met.
	   Holbrooke, who noted that the deal will not affect existing
sanctions against Yugoslavia, said the key to the accord was
Milosevic's decision to allow a 2,000-member ``verification
mission'' and to permit ``aerial verification'' by non-combat
aircraft that could begin as soon as the end of the week.
	   Holbrooke said Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, head
of the OSCE, will soon come to Yugoslavia to sign the mission
agreement. NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark and Secretary-General
Javier Solana will also arrive to sign the aerial mission ``with
appropriate Yugoslav authorities,'' he said.
	   ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' Holbrooke said. ``They
are compliance verifiers.''
	   In addition, political negotiations with the ethnic Albanians
will continue in Kosovo, led by Christopher Hill, the U.S.
ambassador to Macedonia.
	   The ethnic Albanians, who form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2
million-strong population, have insisted on independence rather
than regaining the autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989.
	   But international leaders oppose Kosovo independence, fearing
that could lead to further instability in the tense Balkans. Some
Albanian militants want to establish a ``Greater Albania''
encompassing all Albanian-speaking communities in the southern
Balkans.
	   Holbrooke emphasized that the U.S. delegation was not
proclaiming the talks a victory.
	   ``But if this is the road past the end of the emergency, ...
then we will feel it was worth coming here, we will feel that
international solidarity helped end the crisis,'' he said.
	   Clinton earlier was skeptical about Milosevic's chances of doing
enough by Saturday's deadline to avoid airstrikes.
	   ``Commitments are not compliance,'' he said in New York.
``Balkan graveyards are filled with President Milosevic's broken
promises.''
	   Despite signs of diplomatic progress, Western nations have been
scaling down their embassy staffs in Belgrade and evacuating
observers from Kosovo this week in case diplomacy fails and force
must be used.
	   On Tuesday, the Russian parliament voted to send a fact-finding
delegation of lawmakers to Kosovo.
	   An ethnic Albanian official was positive about the latest
developments.
	   ``We welcome NATO's dedication to stop the genocide and the
human catastrophe,'' said Alush Gashi, foreign secretary of the
League for Democratic Kosovo, the ethnic Albanians' main political
party.
	   ``But we have a very bitter experience with this regime, so we
have to wait and see,'' he said. ``Until now, they say one thing
and do another.''
	   As Holbrooke was returning to Belgrade, Solana announced the
alliance had issued an ``activation order'' placing military
resources on a war footing. But the order does not take effect for
96 hours to allow Holbrooke time to finalize an agreement.
	   ``We have to maintain this pressure,'' Solana said.

U.S. Marine indicted in hit-and-run accident on Okinawa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S. Marine was indicted Tuesday in a hit-and-run
accident on the southern island of Okinawa that left a young
Japanese woman in critical condition.
	   Cpl. Randall M. Eskridge, 23, was charged with causing injury
through negligence, driving under the influence of alcohol and
leaving the scene of an accident by Japanese prosecutors in Naha,
the U.S. Marine Corps said in a press release.
	   Naha, 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) southwest of Tokyo, is the
capital of the Japanese island of Okinawa, where Eskridge was
based. There long has been friction between U.S. troops and local
residents of the island because of crime, noise and other nuisances
blamed on the presence of American bases.
	   Under the Status of Forces Agreement between the United States
and Japan, Eskridge was handed over to Japanese authorities
Tuesday. The agreement outlines what is to be done with military
personal suspected of crimes in Japan.
	   Eskridge is believed to have been the driver of a car that
struck a small motorcycle driven by Yuki Uema, an 18-year-old
student, on Oct. 17. The collision occurred on a highway near the
woman's home in Ginowan city.
	   Marine Corps officials reported the incident to Japanese
authorities after they apprehended Eskridge on suspicion he had
fled the scene of the accident.
	   Eskridge was stopped by a gate guard as he tried to enter a
military facility. The guard noticed unusual damage to the front of
his car, including a cracked windshield.
	   A second Marine who was in the car with Eskridge was questioned
by local police and released.
	   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Foley called on Japanese Foreign Minister
Masahiko Komura after the accident to express condolences to Uema's
family.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
proclaimed a breakthrough Tuesday in efforts to end the Kosovo
crisis after weeklong talks with President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   But, he warned, ``we're not out of the emergency yet.'' He said
it's up to Milosevic's government to prove its commitment to
international demands it agreed to honor _ especially on allowing
an international verification force of 2,000 people into the
Serbian province.
	   Appearing on national television, Milosevic declared that the
agreements ``avert the danger of a military intervention against
our country.''
	   The end of more than a week of intensive talks capped a dramatic
series of developments to force an end to Milosevic's crackdown
against ethnic Albanian separatists in the southern Serbian
province of Kosovo.
	   In rapid succession, NATO formally moved to the verge of
airstrikes and U.S. President Bill Clinton announced key
concessions by Milosevic.
	   Milosevic issued a statement saying the agreement demonstrated
his government's commitment to the peace process, but also
reflected his position that the demands are unwarranted.
	   ``The steps which our country is taking to solve the Kosovo
problems by peaceful means show our firm commitment that all
questions can be solved by political means, but also the
determination to protect the country's territorial integrity and
sovereignty,'' the statement said.
	   Since the crackdown began Feb. 28, Milosevic has insisted the
crisis was an internal matter in which foreign powers should play
no role. The crackdown was aimed at crushing the Kosovo Liberation
Army, fighting for independence of the majority Albanian province,
which is a part of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   Yugoslavia expects that the verification mission, to be led by
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ``will
eliminate false, untrue and malicious reports about the situation
in Kosovo,'' he said.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo and hundreds of
thousands of people have been forced from their homes during the
seven-month operation.
	   International leaders stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis
because of fears that thousands of homeless refugees would die if
they could not return to their homes by the time winter sets in.
	   To make sure Milosevic abides by the agreement, NATO agreed
early Tuesday on the final step needed to authorize airstrikes. The
16-nation alliance set a four-day deadline for Milosevic to begin
complying with international demands.
	   Holbrooke returned immediately afterward to Belgrade and met
briefly with Milosevic for the eighth time in nine days.
	   ``We hope this will mark a turning point in the right direction.
But the proof ... is in compliance with U.N. resolution 1199 and
with actions on the ground in Kosovo,'' the U.S. trouble-shooter
told a news conference before planning to head for New York.
	   NATO took its decision after Holbrooke flew to alliance
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, to brief ambassadors on his
talks with Milosevic.
	   Clinton announced shortly afterward that Milosevic had agreed to
withdraw his forces from Kosovo, initiate autonomy negotiations
with the separatist ethnic Albanians and allow the verification
force to ensure U.N. demands are met.
	   Holbrooke, who noted that the deal will not affect existing
sanctions against Yugoslavia, said the key to the accord was
Milosevic's decision to allow a 2,000-member ``verification
mission'' and to permit ``aerial verification'' by noncombat
aircraft that could begin as soon as the end of the week.
	   Holbrooke said Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, head
of the OSCE, will soon come to Yugoslavia to sign the mission
agreement. NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark and Secretary-General
Javier Solana will also arrive to sign the aerial mission ``with
appropriate Yugoslav authorities,'' he said.
	   ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' Holbrooke said. ``They
are compliance verifiers.''
	   In addition, political negotiations with the ethnic Albanians
will continue in Kosovo, led by Christopher Hill, the U.S.
ambassador to Macedonia.
	   The ethnic Albanians, who form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2
million-strong population, have insisted on independence rather
than regaining the autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989.
	   But international leaders oppose Kosovo independence, fearing
that could lead to further instability in the tense Balkans. Some
Albanian militants want to establish a ``Greater Albania''
encompassing all Albanian-speaking communities in the southern
Balkans.
	   Holbrooke emphasized that the U.S. delegation was not
proclaiming the talks a victory.
	   ``But if this is the road past the end of the emergency ... then
we will feel it was worth coming here, we will feel that
international solidarity helped end the crisis,'' he said.
	   Clinton earlier was skeptical about Milosevic's chances of doing
enough by Saturday's deadline to avoid airstrikes.
	   ``Commitments are not compliance,'' he said in New York.
``Balkan graveyards are filled with President Milosevic's broken
promises.''
	   Despite signs of diplomatic progress, Western nations have been
scaling down their embassy staffs in Belgrade and evacuating
observers from Kosovo this week in case diplomacy fails and force
must be used.
	   On Tuesday, the Russian parliament voted to send a fact-finding
delegation of lawmakers to Kosovo.
	   An ethnic Albanian official was positive about the latest
developments.
	   ``We welcome NATO's dedication to stop the genocide and the
human catastrophe,'' said Alush Gashi, foreign secretary of the
League for Democratic Kosovo, the ethnic Albanians' main political
party.
	   ``But we have a very bitter experience with this regime, so we
have to wait and see,'' he said. ``Until now, they say one thing
and do another.''
	   As Holbrooke was returning to Belgrade, Solana announced the
alliance had issued an ``activation order'' placing military
resources on a war footing. But the order does not take effect for
96 hours to allow Holbrooke time to finalize an agreement.
	   ``We have to maintain this pressure,'' Solana said.

Yeltsin stays home with respiratory infection

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin stayed home Tuesday,
nursing a respiratory infection that forced him to cut short a
foreign trip and revived concerns about his ability to govern.
	   Yeltsin was spending the day at his Gorky-9 country residence
just outside Moscow, and will probably not go into the office all
week, his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, told reporters.
	   However, Yeltsin's condition was stable, Yakushkin said.
	   Doctors insisted Monday that Yeltsin fly home from Central Asia
a day ahead of schedule because he was suffering from an upper
respiratory infection and had a mild fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3
F).
	   They said Yeltsin was being treated with antibiotics and there
were no plans to hospitalize him.
	   Yeltsin, 67, has a history of health problems, including
quintuple heart bypass surgery two years ago, so whenever he gets
sick there is a flurry of speculation about his ability to
function.
	   Yeltsin insists he has no major illness and plans to serve out
the remaining two years of his term. Yakushkin, his spokesman,
reiterated Tuesday there was no talk about an early resignation.
	   ``It's not being discussed,'' he said. ``I am personally against
such a resignation because I think it would only bring peril to the
nation.''
	   Yakushkin and other aides sought to play down the seriousness of
Yeltsin's illness.
	   ``Don't panic, Dad is OK,'' Yeltsin's daughter Tatiana
Dyachenko, who is his official image adviser, was quoted as saying
by the Kommersant business newspaper.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin's personal doctor, Sergei Mironov,
confirmed that the president was suffering from a respiratory
infection known as tracheal bronchitis and that ``his condition is
stable.''
	   ``He must stay in bed like any other person,'' Yakushkin said.
``However, knowing the president's character, he is certain to
start working with documents and making phone calls to Russian
politicians as well as foreign leaders in view of the current
situation in Kosovo.''
	   But the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper said in a front-page
editorial Tuesday that Yeltsin's condition suggests he is suffering
from something worse than a cold.
	   It said his absence from the Kremlin during the current economic
crisis ``amounts to a state catastrophe'' and called on Yeltsin to
immediately surrender most of his powers to Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   Yakushkin dismissed newspaper speculation, citing doctors, that
Yeltsin is suffering from complications following his bypass
surgery and possibly even Alzheimer's disease.
	   ``It's unethical for a doctor to comment on someone's health
without seeing the patient,'' he snapped.
	   A Communist lawmaker called for ``an urgent medical check ... on
the Russian president's health'' to determine whether Yeltsin is
fit to remain in office, the Interfax news agency said.
	   ``Yeltsin's obvious inability to perform his functions is
damaging Russian state authority, as power is being misused by the
clique close to the president,'' said Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of
parliament's security committee.
	   The health of the president, who is also commander-in-chief of
the Russian military, ``is a direct threat to the country's
national security and a factor of serious concern regarding
Russia's nuclear weapons,'' he said.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said the Russian parliament's
upper chamber may demand Wednesday that Yeltsin step down.
	   Other newspapers gave a detailed description of Yeltsin's
weaknesses and his erratic behavior on the trip to the former
Soviet republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakstan _ his first foreign
trip since May.
	   The president appeared stiff and stumbled when he arrived Sunday
in Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent. He had to be supported by
Uzbek President Islam Karimov and canceled other public events.
	   At a state dinner, Yeltsin made rambling remarks, expressing his
satisfaction with local ``facilities and stores'' he never
inspected, the daily Kommersant reported.
	   On Monday, ``the president didn't seem to understand that he
wasn't in Moscow,'' Kommersant said, saying he called aides and
spoke as though they were late for work at the Kremlin.
	   He turned up more than an hour late for talks with Uzbek
officials, making some incoherent remarks interrupted by a bad
cough and abruptly cutting short a scheduled news conference.
	   Yakushkin said Tuesday that it's too early to say whether
Yeltsin would make a scheduled trip to Austria later this month.
``Let's live through this week and on Monday everything will become
clear,'' he said.

Bill to inject public funds in Japan banks passes lower house
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Parliament's lower house on Tuesday passed a bill
that would let Japan's government pump public funds into banks to
induce them to lend more.
	   The legislation is expected to pass the upper house and become
law by Friday. It is aimed at reviving Japan's recession-bound
economy by making it easier for companies to obtain the loans they
need to invest in new business.
	   The law would allow the government to use hundreds of billions
of dollars of taxpayers' money to strengthen weak banks. It would
even allow healthy banks to obtain public cash if they agree to use
it to pay for taking over the operations of a failed lender.
	   The main goal is to give banks the capital they need to make new
loans. Many have been hurt by loans that went sour when Japan's
``bubble'' of stock and land speculation broke in the early 1990s.
	   As much as dlrs 1 trillion in bad debt is clogging Japan's
financial system, leaving banks reluctant to make new loans. The
resulting credit crunch has driven small- and medium-size companies
to bankruptcy in record numbers.
	   Japan's bank problem is a major factor behind the deepest
recession in its postwar history. Economists worry the crisis could
further weigh on economically devastated Asian nations and slow
growth globally.
	   To pay for the bank-rescue plan, Japan's Cabinet on Tuesday
approved a supplementary budget for 1998 that includes a new
allotment of up to 43 trillion yen (dlrs 371 billion) for banks.
	   The new funding would give the government a total of 60 trillion
yen (dlrs 517 billion) _ including 17 trillion yen (dlrs 147
billion) already set aside to strengthen the deposit insurance
system _ to deal with the debt-ridden financial system.
	   ``We have set forth a necessary budget. I would be happy if,
with this, we can win confidence both in Japan and abroad,'' Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi was quoted as saying by Kyodo News service.
	   The budget was presented to Parliament for approval, and with
support from opposition groups as well as the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, it is expected to clear Parliament by Friday,
when the current legislative session ends.
	   The bank bill that passed the lower house Tuesday was a
companion to a set of eight bills Japan passed into law Monday.
	   Those laws are designed to handle the most troubled banks by
allowing the government to take them over before they collapse or
to shut them down in a way that minimizes damage to the financial
system.

Minor fire shuts down Norway's Ekofisk offshore oil field.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ A minor fire aboard a North Sea oil platform
shut down production from the Norwegian Ekofisk field, without
causing injuries or forcing an evacuation, the Phillips Petroleum
Company said Tuesday.
	   A fire broke out in a gas compressor on the Ekofisk 2/4J
platform, about 250 kilometers (150 miles) off southern Norway, on
Monday and was extinguished within 10 minutes, said Phillips
spokesman Ingvar Solberg. The field's 265,000 barrel a day oil plus
natural gas production was stopped immediately, he said.
	   Solberg said production was expected to resume sometime Tuesday,
although natural gas flows would be limited to 473 million cubic
feet (13.4 million cubic meter) per day, about 60 percent of normal
production, until the compressor is repaired.
	   Ekofisk is operated by U.S.-based Phillips, with a 36.96 percent
stake, on behalf of its project partners. Fina Exploration Norway
SCA owns 30 percent and Norsk Agip A/S 13.04 percent, and rest
spread among five other companies.
	   Norway, the world's second largest oil exporter, produces about
3 million barrels of oil a day.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three scientists working in the United
States won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for their discoveries
of how subatomic particles can behave like a fluid.
	   Robert C. Laughlin of the United States, Horst L. Stoermer of
Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a native of China who is now an
American citizen, will share the dlrs 978,000 prize.
	   They discovered that ordinary electrons acting together in
strong magnetic fields and very low temperatures can form new types
of composite particles, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said.
Subsequently, other researchers have confirmed their experiments
and directly observed these new composites, known as
quasiparticles.
	   Laughlin works at Stanford University, Stoermer (pronounced
STER-mer) currently is at Columbia University in New York City and
Tsui (TSOO-ee) teaches at Princeton University. The award
recognizes work that Tsui and Stoermer did together in 1982, which
was elaborated on by Laughlin in 1983.
	   Laughlin, 47, got the news in the middle of the night.
	   ``The reason why this is important is that is has to do with why
the universe is the way it is,'' he said Tuesday. ``You can chop
(the universe) to pieces or learn how all the pieces work together.
This is a triumph of the second.''
	   According to the citation, the three discovered a new form of
``quantum fluid,'' which are fluids such as liquid helium that have
certain properties in common such as superfluidity.
	   What makes these fluids important for researchers is that they
can reveal more about the general inner structure and dynamics of
matter.
	   It is ``yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics,'' the academy
said.
	   The trio's work built on experiments performed by German
physicist Klaus von Kiltzing, who received the Nobel physics prize
in 1985.
	   The Nobel prize in chemistry will be given out later Tuesday
morning.
	   Last year's physics laureates, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of France
and William Phillips and Steven Chu of the United States, were
honored for developing ways of trapping atoms of gas and cooling
them to within a millionth of a degree of absolute zero.
	   The work led to developing extraordinarily accurate atomic
clocks. Previous atomic clocks weren't exactly sloppy, being
accurate to about one second in 32 million years _ but the
improvements made possible a clock that loses just one second every
3 billion years.
	   It also led to the creation of an entirely new form of matter,
achieving what Albert Einstein had postulated was possible some 70
years earlier.
	   The 1997 chemistry winners, American Paul D. Boyer, John E.
Walker of Britain and Jens C. Skou of Denmark, discovered aspects
of how the body's cells store and use energy, a fundamental process
that affects everything from the building of bones to the
transmission of nerve impulses.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   Furchgott, 82, is a pharmacologist at the State University of
New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn; Ignarro, 57, is at the
University of California at Los Angeles; and Murad, 62, is at the
University of Texas Medical School in Houston.
	   Their finding helped lead to the discovery of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra and could also pay off in new treatments for heart
disease, cancer and septic shock.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago. The economics prize winner is to be named
on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
	   All the prizes are announced in Stockholm, except for the peace
prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes
in his will.

Milosevic says agreement averts danger of armed attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic told a
national television audience Tuesday that his agreement on Kosovo
with a special U.S. envoy had averted ``the danger of a military
intervention against our country.''
	   ``I want to inform you that an agreement has been reached to
solve the problems through a peaceful way and by political means,''
a somber-faced Milosevic said. ``The agreement we reached eliminate
the danger of an armed intervention against our country.''
	   Milosevic was referring to threats of NATO airstrikes if he did
not agree to halt the seven-month crackdown against ethnic Albanian
separatists in Kosovo province.
	   He said that despite the ``enormous pressure that we were
exposed to over the past years ... and especially in the past weeks
and days, the determination pervaded that solution can be found
only peacefully.'
	   ``The political solution is aimed the equality of all nations in
Kosovo,'' he added.
	   The agreements reached are ``in accordance with the interests of
our country, with the interest of Republic of Serbia and all of its
citizens and ethnic communities.''
	   ``Our task is to accelerate the political process and economic
recovery of our country as a whole.''
	   Milosevic then thanked all who, as he said, expressed support to
him during the talks, helping him to ``preserve the territorial
integrity and sovereignty of our country,'' and that ``problems in
the southern Serbian province be solved in a peaceful way.
	   ``I think we have achieved that. I thank you all.''

Armed guard for leftist lawmaker threatened by rightist extremists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ For the first time ever, the Israeli parliament
on Tuesday began providing a bodyguard for one of its members, a
left-wing lawmaker who received right-wing threats and had his car
torched.
	   Ran Cohen's car was set on fire after he sponsored a law _ which
parliament subsequently passed _ to remove the grave of slain
gunman Baruch Goldstein from a West Bank settlement.
	   Goldstein gunned down 29 Palestinians at a mosque in the West
Bank city of Hebron in 1994 and was bludgeoned to death by
surviving worshippers.
	   Right-wing admirers have made his grave at the settlement of
Kiryat Arba into a shrine and a place of pilgrimage.
	   Cohen's law obliges the army to remove the body and rebury it in
a less conspicuous place, but court challenges delayed its
implementation.
	   Cohen, from the leftist Meretz party, said in the past two years
he has received many threats from the extreme right. Slogans were
painted on the walls of his house, leaflets were distributed in the
street where he lives and eggs were thrown at him as he addressed
public gatherings.
	   A retired colonel from the paratroopers, Cohen called it ``very
irksome'' that he needed such protection.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three scientists working at
universities in the United States on Tuesday won the Nobel Physics
Prize for discovering that electrons on under certain circumstances
can form new kinds of particles.
	   The prize went to Robert C. Laughlin of the United States, Horst
L. Stoermer of Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a China-born American
citizen.
	   Like many of the Nobel science prizes, this year's award is for
work that is in the rarefied atmosphere of high theory but that
deals with fundamental questions.
	   ``The reason this is important is it has to do with big issues,
why the universe is the way it is,'' Laughlin, 47, of Stanford
University, told The AP by phone as he was having coffee with his
wife at home.
	   Stoermer (pronounced STER-mer), 49, currently is at Columbia
University in New York City and Tsui (TSOO-ee), 59, teaches at
Princeton University.
	   The prize-winning work was done together by Tsui and Stoermer
and elaborated by Laughlin.
	   This year's award recognizes work that leads to a scientific
equivalent of the mystic's desire to see the world in a grain of
sand _ it helps researchers discern the basic secrets of matter by
examining a drop of ``quantum fluid.''
	   According to the citation, the three discovered a new form of
``quantum fluid,'' which are fluids such as liquid helium that have
certain properties in common such as superfluidity.
	   What makes these fluids important for researchers is that
``events in a drop of quantum fluid can afford more profound
insights into the general inner structure and dynamics of matter,''
the academy said.
	   It is ``yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics,'' the citation
said.
	   The 7.6-million-kronor (dlrs 978,000) prize will be divided
equally among the three.
	   Mats Jonson, a physics professor at Sweden's respected Chalmers
Institute of Technology, said the laureates' work could be
important in the development of smaller electronic components and
could lead to improving computer memories.
	   The prize-winning work was done in the early 1980s. Since then,
the development of sophisticated microelectonics has allowed other
researchers to confirm the work's validity, in experiments that the
Academy likened to ``measuring the sound of individual hailstones
during a hailstorm.''
	   Last year's physics laureates, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of France
and William Phillips and Steven Chu of the United States, were
honored for developing ways of trapping atoms of gas and cooling
them to within a millionth of a degree of absolute zero.
	   The work led to developing extraordinarily accurate atomic
clocks. Previous atomic clocks weren't exactly sloppy, being
accurate to about one second in 32 million years _ but the
improvements made possible a clock that loses just one second every
3 billion years.
	   The 1997 chemistry winners, American Paul D. Boyer, John E.
Walker of Britain and Jens C. Skou of Denmark, discovered aspects
of how the body's cells store and use energy, a fundamental process
that affects everything from the building of bones to the
transmission of nerve impulses.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   Their finding helped lead to the discovery of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra and could also pay off in new treatments for heart
disease, cancer and septic shock.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago. The economics prize winner is to be named
on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.	   All the prizes are announced in Stockholm, except for the peace
prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes
in his will.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three scientists working in the United
States won the Nobel Prize in physics Tuesday for their discoveries
of how subatomic particles can behave like a fluid.
	   Robert C. Laughlin of the United States, Horst L. Stoermer of
Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a native of China who is now an
American citizen, will share the dlrs 978,000 prize.
	   They discovered that ordinary electrons acting together in
strong magnetic fields and very low temperatures can form new types
of composite particles, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said.
Subsequently, other researchers have confirmed their experiments
and directly observed these new composites, known as
quasiparticles.
	   Laughlin, 47, works at Stanford University, Stoermer (pronounced
STER-mer), 49, currently is at Columbia University in New York City
and Tsui (TSOO-ee), 59, teaches at Princeton University. The award
recognizes work that Tsui and Stoermer did together in 1982, which
was elaborated on by Laughlin in 1983.
	   Laughlin got the news in the middle of the night.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Government troops killed 11 Tamil
Tiger rebels and lost one soldier while repulsing a guerrilla
attack on their position in Sri Lanka's northeast, the military
said.
	   The latest fighting took place Monday in Trincomalee district,
230 kilometers (140 miles) northeast of Colombo.
	   The fleeing rebels were trapped by government soldiers
positioned nearby. The military recovered 11 bodies of rebels,
assorted weapons, ammunition and bills for rupees 8000,000 (dlrs
12,200).
	   Trincomalee is a town under government control, but the rebels
often target it from surrounding jungles.
	   Tamil rebels are fighting for a homeland in the country's north
and east, claiming that they are discriminated against by the
majority Sinhalese, who control the government and the military.
More than 55,000 people have been killed since 1983.

 &UR; Holbrooke wraps up talks, hails agreement as turning point on
Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke wrapped
up week-long talks with President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday and
proclaimed a breakthrough in efforts to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   But, he warned, ``we're not out of the emergency yet.'' He said
it's up to Milosevic's government to prove its commitment to
international demands it has agreed to honor _ especially on
allowing an international verification force of 2,000 people into
the Serbian province.
	   Appearing on national television, a somber-faced Milosevic
declared that the agreements ``avert the danger of a military
intervention against our country.''
	   ``Our task is to accelerate the political process and economic
recovery of our country as a whole,'' Milosevic said.
	   The end of more than a week of intensive talks capped a dramatic
series of developments to force an end to Milosevic's crackdown
against ethnic Albanian separatists in the southern Serbian
province of Kosovo.
	   In rapid succession, NATO formally moved to the verge of
airstrikes and U.S. President Bill Clinton announced key
concessions by Milosevic.
	   Milosevic issued a statement saying the agreement demonstrated
his government's commitment to the peace process, but also
reflected his position that the demands are unwarranted.
	   ``The steps which our country is taking to solve the Kosovo
problems by peaceful means show our firm commitment that all
questions can be solved by political means, but also the
determination to protect the country's territorial integrity and
sovereignty,'' the statement said.
	   Since the crackdown began Feb. 28, Milosevic has insisted the
crisis was an internal matter in which foreign powers should play
no role. The crackdown was aimed at crushing the Kosovo Liberation
Army, fighting for independence of the majority Albanian province,
which is a part of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   Yugoslavia expects that the verification mission, to be led by
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ``will
eliminate false, untrue and malicious reports about the situation
in Kosovo,'' he said.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo and hundreds of
thousands of people have been forced from their homes during the
seven-month operation.
	   International leaders stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis
because of fears that thousands of homeless refugees would die if
they could not return to their homes by the time winter sets in.
	   To make sure Milosevic abides by the agreement, NATO agreed
early Tuesday on the final step needed to authorize airstrikes. The
16-nation alliance set a four-day deadline for Milosevic to begin
complying with international demands.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, an ethnic Albanian politician
who claims to speak for the KLA. said he was pleased by the NATO
action but expressed skepticism that Milosevic would live up to the
agreement.
	   The politician, Adem Demaci, said he was disappointed that the
verification force would be unarmed.

Cohen arrives in Saudi, visits U.S troops stationed there
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
arrived here Tuesday on the last leg of a Gulf tour aimed at
convincing allies to finance a regional missile defense system.
	   Cohen is expected to meet with Saudi King Fahd and Defense
Minister Prince Sultan later Tuesday, said a Saudi official,
speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   He said Cohen toured the Prince Sultan Air Base south of Riyadh
to visit some 5,000 U.S. troops stationed there.
	   They are among the 24,050 U.S. military men and women in the
Gulf region, according to Pentagon figures. The United States also
has 24 Navy ships and some 170 warplanes and helicopters stationed
here.
	   During a stop in Kuwait Monday, Cohen told reporters that Gulf
allies have been receptive to the idea of a missile defense system
to protect civilians and U.S. soldiers from the threat of attacks
by countries such as Iran.
	   The United States wants its allies to help fund the development
of antimissile systems or cooperate in it's future deployment,
Cohen said.
	   The U.S. Theater High-Altitude Area Defense missile program is
supposed to be an improvement on the Patriot system used with mixed
results in the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The initiative, which has cost dlrs 3.2 billion so far, has
suffered five successive test failures and top U.S. officials have
been considering whether to cancel it. Cohen wants it continued.
	   The United States sees Iraq and Iran as major threats to the
Gulf region. Iran recently tested a long-range missile and the
United States accuses Iraq, which is under U.N. sanctions, of
continuing efforts to acquire missile technology that has a range
longer than it is permitted to have.
	   Security for U.S. troops in the Gulf has been a priority
following two fatal bombings in Saudi Arabia.
	   In the first attack, five American servicemen and two Indian
nationals were killed in the bombing of a military center in Riyadh
in November 1995. A truck bombing in the eastern city of Dhahran in
June 1996 killed 19 U.S. airmen.
	   Cohen also visited the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The wife of arrested Malaysian
dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim says she wants to learn from the
Philippines' struggle against the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos to
push the democratic reform movement in her country.
	   In a recent letter to former Philippine President Corazon
Aquino, Azizah Ismail said she would continue her husband's
peaceful struggle for political reforms in Malaysia.
	   ``I would be most grateful if you can further share with me your
wealth of experience gained during the period of the oppressive
Marcos regime,'' Azizah said in her Oct. 7 letter. A copy was
obtained by The Associated Press Tuesday.
	   ``It will be most valuable in assisting me to find the strength
and resilience to face the undemocratic onslaught of the current
regime in my country,'' Azizah said, adding she wanted to
personally meet Mrs. Aquino.
	   Azizah was responding to a letter Mrs. Aquino sent her earlier
by fax in which the former Philippine leader narrated her ordeal
when her husband, the late Sen. Benigno Aquino, the chief political
rival of Marcos, was arrested, jailed and then murdered upon
returning from U.S. exile in 1983.
	   The assassination of Mrs. Aquino's husband at Manila's
international airport triggered massive protests that culminated in
the ``people power'' revolt that toppled Marcos in 1986 and
installed Mrs. Aquino as president.
	   Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar as his
deputy on Sept. 2 after the two differed on economic policy,
although Mahathir said moral issues led to the dismissal. Anwar
then began speaking out against Mahathir, and was arrested Sept. 20
on charges of corruption and sexual misconduct.
	   Thousands of Anwar's supporters have held protest demonstrations
in recent days, demanding his release.
	   In her letter, Aquino praised Azizah's courage.
	   ``By your example, I'm sure that there will be many more who
will join you as you carry on with Anwar's commitment for
reforms,'' Mrs. Aquino wrote.
	   Mrs. Aquino urged Azizah to continue inspiring the Malaysian
people ``so that more and more of them will join you and Anwar in
your quest for political and economic reforms.''
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Indonesian President
B.J. Habibie have also spoken out against Anwar's treatment.
	   Estrada has said he was considering skipping a summit of
Asia-Pacific leaders in Malaysia in November because of the arrest
of Anwar, whom he described as a personal friend.
	   On Tuesday, Filipino gays protested at the Malaysian Embassy in
Manila, demanding Anwar's release and respect for his human rights.
They also urged Malaysia to decriminalize homosexuality.
	   The Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia are among the founding
members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which also
includes Brunei, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Ukrainian parliament to debate Cabinet's fate

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament defied appeals from
President Leonid Kuchma and decided Tuesday to hold a no-confidence
vote in the government because of its handling of a growing
economic crisis.
	   The leftist-dominated Verkhovna Rada voted 296-24 to consider
the motion, one day after Kuchma said such action would only
``aggravate the situation in the country'' and hurt the economy.
	   ``Nobody would win, no political force would benefit from that,
and ordinary people would suffer, as usual,'' the president said.
	   Immediately after the vote, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko
presented a report on the government's performance in 1998 and
attacked his leftist foes, who initiated the no-confidence vote.
	   ``As economic problems get worse, the Cabinet is finding itself
in the midst of a political struggle,'' Pustovoitenko said. ``This
undermines the government's authority and raises doubts about its
ability to overcome the crisis.''
	   A no-confidence motion needs a simple majority vote to be
approved by the 450-seat legislature. Ukraine's 1996 constitution
says the government would then need to resign, but does not specify
the procedure.
	   Kuchma said Monday that if the Communist-led opposition went
ahead with the no-confidence motion, he would not interfere. He
said he would offer Communist leader Petro Symonenko the prime
minister's job and let the opposition try to solve the country's
problems.
	   Kuchma believes that the Communists are not ready to assume
responsibility for leading the country, and expects them to turn
down such an offer.
	   Ukraine, a former Soviet republic of 50 million people, has
suffered badly as a result of the economic crisis in neighboring
Russia.
	   Inflation has soared, causing foreign investors to withdraw from
Ukraine's shaky financial market. The national hryvna currency has
lost 71 percent of its value so far this year, according to
Pustovoitenko.
	   The government also has heavy domestic and foreign debts,
industrial output is falling and budget revenues remain billions of
dollars off targets because of the inability to collect taxes.
	   Pustovoitenko told parliament that his Cabinet has managed to
ease the crisis through the recent conversion of government bonds
and tight controls over the currency market, but admitted that the
situation remained critical.
	   He said the government planned to support selected industries,
stimulate banking activities and investments and amend the complex
tax system that has discouraged some foreign investors from coming
to Ukraine.
	   Pustovoitenko also promised to support private businesses and
focus more on privatization, which has stalled in recent months.

Italy's opposition calls for early elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's opposition forces, led by former Premier
Silvio Berlusconi, called Tuesday for early elections to resolve
the country's political stalemate.
	   But the installation of a government of technocrats appeared the
most likely scenario.
	   ``When a government loses its majority it must give the power of
choice back to the citizens,'' Berlusconi said.
	   The media magnate spoke following talks with President Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro, who has been meeting with political leaders since
Friday when Premier Romano Prodi resigned after his government lost
a confidence vote.
	   Prodi's far-left allies, the Communist Refoundation party,
provoked the crisis by withdrawing their support over the 1999
deficit-cutting budget, which they said did not do enough to
stimulate job creation.
	   Berlusconi said that if the ``consensus is against elections,''
then a government with a limited mandate should be installed to
prepare Italy for elections.
	   Scalfaro is expected to name a new premier this week. Political
leaders appear to favor Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who
would lead a government of technocrats to pass the budget and take
Italy through the Jan. 1 launch of the European common currency,
the euro.
	   Scalfaro could also opt to ask Prodi to try again with a new
majority. But Prodi, who is acting as caretaker premier, has
virtually ruled out a second mandate saying he would accept only if
his new government maintained the policies of his old one.
	   Prodi's government was the country's second-longest serving
since World War II.

Japan wants to reach common ground with China over war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Chinese comment, last two grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura said Tuesday Japan
hopes to reach a mutual understanding with China over the painful
wartime history between the two nations in time for President Jiang
Zemin's upcoming visit.
	   Komura told a news conference the two sides are in final
discussions aimed at reaching a common understanding of Japan's
aggression against China, which began in the early 1930s and lasted
through the end of World War II.
	   ``It would be nice if we can issue a joint statement,'' he said,
though he would not provide details as the two sides were still
ironing them out.
	   The talks follow Japan's fullest-ever apology to South Korea
over its 35-year colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.
	   The joint declaration, signed by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, also vowed to put behind the
painful past and build a new, future-oriented friendship.
	   Jiang's visit, originally scheduled for early September, has
been postponed because of massive flooding in China. He is now
expected by the end of this year, possibly as early as after the
Nov. 17-18 summit of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur.
	   In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang
said Tuesday, ``The Chinese side has always maintained that the
past, if not forgotten, can serve as a guide for the future, and is
ready to face the future and develop better relations between the
peoples of China and Japan on the basis of respect for history. ...
	   ``The adoption of the correct attitude by Japan on historical
issues is conducive for the maintenance of political foundation for
China-Japan relations and enhancement of understanding and trust
between Japan and Asian neighbors,'' he added.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Here is the text of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's statement on Kosovo, delivered
Tuesday on national television. He spoke in Serbian and the remarks
were translated by The Associated Press.
	   -0-
	   ``I want to inform you that an agreement has been reached to
solve the problems in a peaceful way and by political means.
	   The agreement we reached eliminates the danger of an armed
intervention against our country.
	   As for the political solution, it will be directed towards
affirmation of national equality and equality of all nationalities
in Kosovo.
	   In the enormous pressures that we have been exposed to over the
past years, and especially in the past weeks and days, the
determination pervaded that good solutions can be found only
peacefully.
	   The agreements we have reached are entirely in accordance with
the interests of our country, with the interests of Republic of
Serbia and of all its citizens and of all citizens and ethnic
communities in Kosovo.
	   The task now is to accelerate the political process and to
accelerate economic recovery of our country as a whole.
	   Lastly, I wish to thank to all the citizens who, here and from
abroad, all this time have been sending me messages of strong
support. The messages were also a task to preserve sovereignty and
territorial integrity of our country, to preserve its dignity and
on the other hand to provide that problems in the southern Serbian
province be solved in a peaceful way.
	   I think we have achieved that. I thank you all.''

Report: Ukraine's metallurgical exports falling fast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's metallurgical exports fell
sharply this year and will continue to fall because of the
worldwide financial crisis, officials said Tuesday.
	   The country's metallurgical companies exported 14 million metric
tons (15.4 million short tons) of steel and other products in the
first nine months of 1998, only 20 percent of their total export
volume over the same period last year, the Industrial Policies
Ministry said.
	   The ministry said the fall was caused primarily by the economic
crisis in Southeast Asia, the region that accounts for 80 percent
of the former Soviet republic's metallurgical exports, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Ukraine's metals were also badly affected by the rapid
development of metallurgical companies in China and South America,
which have created serious competition, the ministry said.
	   Ukraine relies on the metallurgical sector for more than
one-third of its export earnings.

Romanian lawyers protest against parliament decision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ For the first time in 50 years,
hundreds of lawyers refused to enter court Tuesday, protesting
draft legislation which they fear may reduce their number of
clients.
	   Last week, lawmakers in parliament's lower Chamber of Deputies
voted to give Romania's 25,000 legal counselors, who are employed
at state or private companies, the same rights as attorneys who
find their own clients.
	   This would allow advisers, who are currently restricted to
working for the companies by which they are employed, to also seek
employment as attorneys.
	   Most Romanian companies and state institutions have legal
advisers, who are specialists in financial law. They earn much less
than attorneys.
	   In a letter to the president's office and parliament Monday, the
Lawyers Union, to which Romania's 7,000 lawyers belong, protested
the proposed legislation.
	   ``A government legal adviser cannot work as an attorney for a
client who is suing the government,'' said the letter.
	   The law needs to pass though parliament's upper chamber, the
Senate, and be signed by President Emil Constantinescu before it is
enacted.
	   Lawyers fear that if the Senate votes the draft law, clients
will first ask legal advisers where they work to represent them,
rather than hiring a lawyer.
	   ``The decision breaks the rules of the Constitution and we
cannot allow this,'' said lawyer Andreea Vaduva, addingt the law
defines different areas of legal activity for lawyers and legal
advisers.
	   Both lawyers and legal advisers graduate a six-year course at
the Faculty of Juridical Sciences.
	   Justice Ministry spokesman Ion Badea said the ministry does not
agree with the lawyers' protest and they ought to lobby Senators,
before their vote.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
proclaimed a breakthrough in efforts to end the Kosovo crisis after
weeklong talks with President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday.
	   But, he warned, ``we're not out of the emergency yet.'' He said
it's up to Milosevic's government to prove its commitment to
honoring international demands _ especially allowing an
international verification force of 2,000 people into Kosovo.
	   Appearing on national television, a somber Milosevic declared
that the agreements ``avert the danger of a military intervention
against our country.''
	   ``Our task is to accelerate the political process and economic
recovery of our country as a whole,'' Milosevic said.
	   The end of more than a week of intensive talks capped dramatic
efforts to force an end to Milosevic's crackdown against ethnic
Albanian separatists in the southern province in Serbia, the
dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   In rapid succession, NATO moved to the verge of airstrikes and
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced key concessions by Milosevic.
	   Milosevic said the agreement demonstrated his government's
commitment to the peace process, but also reflected his position
that the demands are unwarranted.
	   ``The steps which our country is taking to solve the Kosovo
problems by peaceful means show our firm commitment that all
questions can be solved by political means, but also the
determination to protect the country's territorial integrity and
sovereignty,'' he said in a statement.
	   Since the crackdown began Feb. 28, Milosevic has insisted the
crisis was an internal matter in which foreign powers should play
no role. The crackdown was aimed at crushing the Kosovo Liberation
Army, fighting for independence of the majority ethnic Albanian
province.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo and hundreds of
thousands of people have been forced from their homes during the
seven-month operation.
	   International leaders stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis
because of fears that thousands of homeless refugees would die if
they could not return to their homes by the time winter sets in.
	   Yugoslavia expects that the verification mission, to be led by
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ``will
eliminate false, untrue and malicious reports about the situation
in Kosovo,'' he said.
	   To make sure Milosevic abides by the agreement, NATO agreed
Tuesday on the final step needed to authorize airstrikes. The
16-nation alliance set a four-day deadline for Milosevic to begin
complying with international demands.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, an ethnic Albanian politician
who claims to speak for the KLA, said he was pleased by the NATO
action but expressed skepticism that Milosevic would live up to the
agreement.
	   The politician, Adem Demaci, said he was disappointed that the
verification force would be unarmed.

Sharif appoints new chief of elite intelligence agency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TO CORRECT spelling of army in slug &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ In another major reshuffle in the
hierarchy of Pakistan's powerful military, Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif appointed a new chief of the state's elite intelligence
agency, an army spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Gen. Ziauddin, who uses only one name, takes over as new head of
the Inter-Services Intelligence agency (ISI), the states premier
spy agency.
	   The move followed last week's surprise resignation of Army Chief
Gen. Jehangir Karamat, who was critical of Sharif's political and
economic policies.
	   Two other senior generals also resigned after Karamat. They
resigned after being passed over for promotion when Sharif
appointed Gen. Pervaiz Mushraf as new army chief.
	   Sharif's critics say he is orchestrating the reshuffle of the
army to gain control of the military, which has ruled Pakistan for
25 of its 51-year history. It has repeatedly thrown out civilian
rulers to take control.
	   Ziauddin replaces Lt. Gen Nasim Rana, who has not been given a
new assignment, the English-language daily newspaper The News
reported Tuesday.
	   An Army spokesman said Ziauddin comes from Sharif's hometown of
Lahore, the capital of Pakistan's powerful Punjab province.
	   The new ISI chief ``is known for his professional competence and
up-right character,'' said an army spokesman who cannot be
identified according to usual briefing rules.

Murdoch: News Corp. readying for market downturn
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with Murdoch fearing global recession &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Billionaire media magnate Rupert
Murdoch said Tuesday a global recession was possible and questioned
the ability of governments to do anything to avoid it.
	   At the annual general meeting of his News Corp. Ltd., company
chief executive Murdoch said there had been substantial shocks to
the world's financial systems and there may be more in the next few
months.
	   ``We seem to be moving to a period of deflation,'' he told
shareholders.
	   Asked later by reporters if he feared a global recession,
Murdoch said: ``Everyone is worried about the possibility of it.''
	   He said it was not known whether governments and central banks
would be able to protect their economies from ``violent'' shifts in
global markets.
	   ``Around the world the big question is just how much governments
will be able to do, as against how much central bankers will be
able to do, or how much markets will just go past all those
forces,'' Murdoch said.
	   ``We are in a new paradigm altogether and governments can maybe
soften the effects of violent movement in the markets, but not much
else.''
	   Murdoch said News Corp. was not planning any significant
acquisitions as it braces for a significant downturn in world
markets, and that the company would hold large sums of cash amid
the market volatility.
	   He said News Corp. had positioned itself earlier this year by
refinancing from short-term to long-term debt. He noted that the
company had no significant repayments over the next five years.
	   It had significant sums of cash at the bank and ``we intend to
keep it that way until we see more clearly what the future holds,''
he added.
	   He also said he was confident of a strong year ahead for the
company's Filmed Entertainment business.
	   ``We are feeling fairly bullish about it and we expect to have
another very good year,'' Murdoch said, adding the company was
currently on a good streak with its movies.
	   The success of multiple Academy Award winner ``Titanic'' helped
boost News Corp. profits last financial year. ``Titanic'' reaped 3
billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.8 billion) at the box
office.
	   News Corp. posted an annual net profit of 1.68 billion
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.04 billion) for the financial year
ended June 30, 1998.
	   As well as ``Titanic,'' News Corp.'s Twentieth Century Fox
subsidiary released the hugely popular, low budget film ``The Full
Monty.''
	   Murdoch said the global media group had a strong schedule of
movies coming on stream over the next two years and while there was
no guessing as to whether they would be successful, he was ``very
confident indeed about the future there.''
	   Murdoch also said that the public float of subsidiary Fox
Entertainment Group would go ahead.
	   News Corp. plans to take this unit public, offering 13.4 percent
of the shares in Fox Entertainment to raise between 1.5 billion and
2 billion Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 900 million-1.2 billion).

Three suspected thieves poison themselves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Three suspected thieves killed
themselves allegedly by consuming pesticide in front of a police
station in southern India, police said Tuesday.
	   In their 20s, the three were found writhing in pain and later
died in hospital on Monday. Their relatives accused police of
torturing the suspects.
	   The state government asked a magistrate to probe the deaths in
Mehboobabad, a town 175 kilometers (110 miles) north of Hyderabad,
the capital of Andhra Pradesh state,
	   R.P. Thakur, the superintendent of police, said the three had
confessed the crime. When police asked for the stolen amount of
30,000 (dlrs 715), the three went and drank pesticide mixing it
with whisky.
	   Lingamma, mother of Vallepu Lingiaiah, alleged that police had
asked for rupees 50,000 (dlrs 1,190) to save her son from torture.
Lingamma uses one name.
	   Thakur denied the accusation and said post mortem showed that
poison had killed the three.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's government announced Tuesday it is
setting up an office in Beijing next month to improve
communications with mainland Chinese authorities and coordinate
cross-border affairs.
	   Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa also appointed Stephen Lam, a top

	   The post was dropped after China regained sovereignty over Hong
Kong from Britain last year.
	   Tung, a former shipping tycoon, has acknowledged that he needs

	   Bowen Leung, secretary for planning, environment and lands, was
appointed director of the new Beijing office.

Pro-rebel Mexican county elects former police officer mayor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OAXACA CITY, Mexico (AP) _ Voters in a southern Mexican county
supportive of leftist rebels have elected a former state police
officer as their new mayor.
	   The election Sunday of Lucio Vazquez Ramirez in San Agustin
Loxicha, 115 kms south of the state capital Oaxaca City, underlines
possible links between the rebel Popular Revolutionary Army and
local officials.
	   Investigators looking into armed attacks by the rebel group,
known by its Spanish initials EPR, have said local officials in San
Agustin Loxicha included suspected rebels.
	   Vazquez resigned less than two months ago from the Oaxaca state
judicial police to run for the county mayorship. He won on a vote
of 1,146 to 11. Less than 30 percent of the county's eligible
voters cast ballots.
	   As a police officer, Vazquez had participated in operations to
catch suspected guerrillas, according to the state human rights
commission.
	   The EPR rose up in neighboring Guerrero state in 1996 on the
anniversary of a massacre of 17 peasants by state police. The group
has demanded sweeping political reforms.
	   San Agustin Loxicha is one of 418 Oaxacan counties where
indigenous communities are allowed to choose their leaders based on
traditional customs, usually by consensus and without the
participation of political parties.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon's Parliament on Tuesday ratified
a constitutional amendment to clear the way for the election of the
army's commander, Gen. Emile Lahoud, as president.
	   Lahoud has received the backing of Syria, the main power broker
in the country, making his election by the pro-Syrian Parliament
just a formality during a vote scheduled on Thursday.
	   A total of 113 deputies voted for the amendment and four
deputies against, including the general's cousin, Nassib Lahoud, a
presidential aspirant. Eleven deputies were absent.
	   Among those who were absent was Walid Jumblatt, a Cabinet
minister who had said he would boycott the session to protest the
choice of a military man even though Lahoud has wide public and
political support.
	   Outgoing President Elias Hrawi signed the constitutional
amendment later Tuesday and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri called
the 128-member legislature into session on Thursday for the vote.

Probes to continue of Thai teacher accused of trading grades for

cash &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Two investigations of a teacher at a
state-run university accused of extorting money from his students
have found there is reason to believe him guilty of wrongdoing, a
local newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   Wannakit Rattanakorn, an astronomy teacher at the Rajabhat
Institute in Surat Thani, 530 kilometers (330 miles) southwest of
Bangkok, was accused by a colleague of asking money from students
in exchange for good grades.
	   Wannakit has said he merely solicited donations to buy teaching
equipment.
	   But two committees _ one set up by the Education Ministry and
the other by the administrators of the Rajabhat Institutes, which
are teachers training colleges _ have concluded there is enough
evidence of wrongdoing to warrant further investigations, the
newspaper The Nation reported.
	   A third committee, set up by Wannakit's own institute, is also
investigating the case, it reported.
	   If all three panels conclude after full investigations that the
teacher is guilty as charged, he could be dismissed from the civil
service, the report said. If they don't agree on his guilt or
innocence, a new committee would be formed.
	   Since the case came to light, other students at the school have
come forward to complain of shady practices by some teachers,
including selling students photocopies of textbooks at prices
higher than the originals.
	   The scandal has underscored questions about Thailand's
educational system, which has been criticized for concentrating on
rote learning and not turning out a work force capable of
attracting investment for high-technology industries.

Service sector receipts plummet in second quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's service sector suffered a major
slump in the quarter ended June 30, with only the insurance
industry able to increase its business, the government said
Tuesday.
	   The Census and Statistics Department said in a statement that
the value of business receipts in the finance industry, excluding
banking, fell by 42 percent from the same quarter in 1997.
	   The hotel sector's business receipts fell by 34 percent from a
year earlier, and the real estate sector's by 30 percent, it said.
	   The finance sector's slump resulted mainly from substantial
falls in the Hang Seng Index, the main barometer of blue-chip
shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the statement said.
	   Despite recent gains, the Hang Seng Index is still almost 50
percent lower than its peak in August 1997. Property prices also
have dropped by 50 percent from a year ago.
	   The department said business receipts fell by 15 percent in the
wholesale-retail sector, and by 11 percent in the transport sector.
	   But those in the insurance industry rose by 10 percent, and
those in the communications industry fell by just 5 percent, mainly
because of more competitive price packages and intensive
promotions, it added.

 &UR; Holbrooke wraps up talks, hails agreement as turning point on
Kosovo

Milosevic TV statements RARE; TRIMS; no pickup &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke wrapped
up week-long talks with President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday and
proclaimed a breakthrough in efforts to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   But, he warned, ``we're not out of the emergency yet.'' He said
it's up to Milosevic's government to prove its commitment to
international demands it has agreed to honor _ especially on
allowing an international verification force of 2,000 people into
the Serbian province.
	   In a rare national television address, Milosevic declared that
the agreements ``avert the danger of a military intervention
against our country.''
	   ``Our task is to accelerate the political process and economic
recovery of our country as a whole,'' Milosevic said. It was the
first time the Yugoslav president had addressed the nation since
the 1995 Dayton peace accords which ended the war in neighboring
Bosnia.
	   Tuesday's developments capped a dramatic series of developments
to force an end to Milosevic's crackdown against ethnic Albanian
separatists in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   In rapid succession, NATO formally moved to the verge of
airstrikes and U.S. President Bill Clinton announced key
concessions by Milosevic.
	   Before his television address, Milosevic issued a statement
saying the agreement demonstrated his government's commitment to
the peace process, but also reflected his position that the demands
are unwarranted.
	   ``The steps which our country is taking to solve the Kosovo
problems by peaceful means show our firm commitment that all
questions can be solved by political means, but also the
determination to protect the country's territorial integrity and
sovereignty,'' the statement said.
	   Since the crackdown began Feb. 28, Milosevic has insisted the
crisis was an internal matter in which foreign powers should play
no role. The crackdown was aimed at crushing the Kosovo Liberation
Army, fighting for independence of the majority Albanian province,
which is a part of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   Yugoslavia expects that the verification mission, to be led by
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ``will
eliminate false, untrue and malicious reports about the situation
in Kosovo,'' Milosevic said in his statement.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo and hundreds of
thousands of people have been forced from their homes during the
seven-month operation.
	   International leaders stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis
because of fears that thousands of homeless refugees would die if
they could not return to their homes by the time winter sets in.
	   To make sure Milosevic abides by the agreement, NATO agreed
early Tuesday on the final step needed to authorize airstrikes. The
16-nation alliance set a four-day deadline for Milosevic to begin
complying with international demands.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, an ethnic Albanian politician
who claims to speak for the KLA. said he was pleased by the NATO
action but expressed skepticism that Milosevic would live up to the
agreement.
	   The politician, Adem Demaci, said he was disappointed that the
verification force would be unarmed.
	   After late night meetings in Brussels, Holbrooke returned
immediately afterward to Belgrade and met briefly with Milosevic
for the eighth time in nine days.
	   ``We hope this will mark a turning point in the right direction.
But the proof ... is in compliance with U.N. resolution 1199 and
with actions on the ground in Kosovo,'' the U.S. trouble-shooter
told a news conference before planning to head for New York.
	   NATO took its decision after Holbrooke flew to alliance
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, to brief ambassadors on his
talks with Milosevic.
	   Clinton announced shortly afterward that Milosevic had agreed to
withdraw his forces from Kosovo, initiate autonomy negotiations
with the separatist ethnic Albanians and allow the verification
force to ensure U.N. demands are met.
	   Holbrooke, who noted that the deal will not affect existing
sanctions against Yugoslavia, said the key to the accord was
Milosevic's decision to allow a 2,000-member ``verification
mission'' and to permit ``aerial verification'' by non-combat
aircraft that could begin as soon as the end of the week.
	   Holbrooke said Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, head
of the OSCE, will soon come to Yugoslavia to sign the mission
agreement. NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark and Secretary-General
Javier Solana will also arrive to sign the aerial mission ``with
appropriate Yugoslav authorities,'' he said.
	   ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' Holbrooke said. ``They
are compliance verifiers.''
	   In addition, political negotiations with the ethnic Albanians
will continue in Kosovo, led by Christopher Hill, the U.S.
ambassador to Macedonia.
	   The ethnic Albanians, who form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2
million-strong population, have insisted on independence rather
than regaining the autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989.
	   But international leaders oppose Kosovo independence, fearing
that could lead to further instability in the tense Balkans. Some
Albanian militants want to establish a ``Greater Albania''
encompassing all Albanian-speaking communities in the southern
Balkans.
	   In Brussels, NATO sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Milosevic must take four steps: withdraw special troops from
Kosovo immediately, sign an agreement with the OSCE on the
verification mission, sign an agreement with NATO on the airborne
reconnaissance and hammer out a ``framework agreement'' by November
outlining future talks with ethnic Albanians.
	   The agreements with OSCE and NATO are expected to be signed
within days, the sources said.
	   Holbrooke emphasized that the U.S. delegation was not
proclaiming the talks a victory.
	   ``But if this is the road past the end of the emergency, ...
then we will feel it was worth coming here, we will feel that
international solidarity helped end the crisis,'' he said.

On eve of China talks, Taiwan calls for recognition

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ On the eve of talks with China aimed at
restoring their dialogue, Taiwan officials called Tuesday for a
fresh start in relations but again demanded recognition of their
island as an equal.
	   Speaking of a ``heavy responsibility,'' top negotiator Koo
Chen-fu said he hoped informal discussions with counterpart Wang
Daohan starting Wednesday in Shanghai would help end a three-year
break in negotiations.
	   ``This is a starting point for rebuilding trust between the
sides,'' said Koo, 81, a businessman and senior member of the
ruling Nationalist Party.
	   Koo, who will lead a 12-member delegation of scholars and
officials, is also scheduled to meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and Vice Premier Qian Qichen in Beijing Sunday.
	   Qian is considered a hard-line advocate of China's view that
Taiwan is a renegade province that must submit to its authority or
face military attack.
	   The meetings provide a chance for each side to better understand
the other's positions, said Chang King-yu, Taiwan's Cabinet
official for China affairs.
	   But he said China must be realistic.
	   ``We hope the mainland side can pragmatically face the issues
that the two sides need to resolve,'' Chang said at a news
conference. ``Only by respecting the reality of separation between
the sides can there be a breakthrough in relations.''
	   Koo and Wang will meet for the first time since their 1993 talks
in Singapore _ the first formal contact between the two sides since
they split during a civil war in 1949.
	   For two years, the two sides negotiated on practical issues such
as mutual recognition of legal documents. But an agreement proved
elusive, and in 1995 China suspended the talks in anger over
Taiwan's campaign to raise its international profile.
	   China says Taiwan has no right to foreign relations and demands
it at least begin to discuss political issues related to
reunification before the formal dialogue can resume on a regular
basis.
	   Koo's mission is to persuade China that pragmatic issues also
have political aspects, and that attaining consensus on mundane
topics first is the best way to build trust.
	   In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang described
the talks as a ``major event'' in relations, but said China's
insistence on political talks was unchanged.
	   China still insists Taiwan must be reunified with the mainland
under a formula allowing the island to maintain its capitalist
system, Tang told a regular news briefing.
	   Taiwan has been careful not to build up expectations for Koo's
visit, officially termed a ``get-together.''
	   But it has tried to sweeten the atmosphere, canceling a military
display and visits abroad by its vice president that could have
riled Beijing. China responded by agreeing to allow 248 illegal
aliens detained in Taiwan to return home, removing a major headache
for authorities here.
	   An opinion poll in the United Daily News showed three-quarters
of Taiwanese have faith in Koo's diplomatic skills, but more than
half doubt the meetings will yield results.
	   Warming ties reflect a coincidence of interests. Jiang wants a
breakthrough on the Taiwan issue to cement his authority,
especially over the military, while better China ties could help
the Nationalists in December's general elections. Better ties might
also prompt a revision of restrictions on investment in China that
are broadly unpopular in the business community.
	   Washington too has ardently supported a resumption of dialogue,
sending retired officials to both sides earlier in the year to
gently nudge them toward talks.
	   A positive outcome from the meetings could offer a rare bright
spot in a region troubled by crashed economies, social unrest in
Indonesia and Malaysia, and North Korea's missile adventurism.

Should fish be food only for thought at the aquarium?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ It's a menu to whet the appetite of any seafood
connoisseur: crab cakes, grilled yellowfin tuna, savory clam
chowder and breaded haddock.
	   There's just one problem for some customers: It's all being
served at Boston's New England Aquarium.
	   It may seem a silly concern, but some animal rights activists
say serving fish at the aquarium, which prides itself on marine
conservation, sends a mixed message.
	   The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which wants the
aquarium to adopt a vegetarian menu with such soybean items as
``Not-Dogs'' and ``Tu-No,'' plans a protest this week at the
aquarium.
	   ``How can you display fish that are so beautiful, then turn
around and eat them?'' said Christine Dorchak, an animal rights
activist in Boston.
	   ``We don't serve our exhibits,'' said Sue Knapp, a spokeswoman
for the aquarium, which sits on the edge of Boston Harbor. ``We
want to foster an appreciation for the aquatic world. Eating
seafood can be a part of that.''
	   And there's another argument: Aquarium residents eat far more
fish than their two-legged visitors.
	   ``We feed our marine mammals 650 pounds (295 kilos) of fish per
day. We use about 20 pounds (9 kilos) per day in the restaurant,''
said Deb Fassnacht, senior vice president at Chicago's Shedd
Aquarium, where seafood lovers can savor Chilean sea bass topped
with grape sauce or feast on the salmon with pasta.
	   At SeaWorld in Orlando, Florida, patrons can sample various
seafood plates at the park's eight dining facilities. ``We don't
see it as a conflict of interest,'' SeaWorld spokeswoman Kjerstin
Dillon said.
	   The New England aquarium says it has no plans to remove marine
species from its menu. But it says it will not serve species, such
as swordfish, whose stocks are depleted.
	   ``If eating seafood at the aquarium's restaurant gets people
talking about where fish comes from and the types of fish that are
overfished, then that's a good thing,'' Knapp said.
	   Hot dogs, it turns out, are the top seller at the aquarium's
Harbor Cafe, but other favorites are fish sandwiches, fish nuggets
and that New England classic, chowder.
	   The night menu, reserved for special functions, is more upscale
_ grilled shrimp, yellowfin tuna, crab cakes, Dover sole and
salmon.
	   ``They really shouldn't be serving fish here if they're talking
about preservation,'' said Carolyn Morgis, a mother from Hamden,
Connecticut, who visited the aquarium recently with her four
children. ``We got the nachos.''
	   ``We've learned about how some of the fish are endangered
here,'' said another visitor, 11-year-old Kaitlyn Morgis of
Connecticut. ``But then they, like, serve them. That's bad.''
	   But others said not serving seafood in the New England Aquarium
would ruin the experience of visiting New England, the northeastern
U.S. region asjoining the seafood-abundant north Atlantic.
	   ``New England is about seafood,'' said Patti Dion, a New England
native who lives in El Paso, Texas. ``I love seafood on any menu,
even if it's here.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli man was killed and a second
critically wounded in a drive-by shooting Tuesday, and police said
the assailants apparently were Palestinian militants.
	   The incident occurred near Ora, a communal farm west of
Jerusalem.
	   Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said the victims were
bathing in a spring near Ora when shots were fired at them from a
passing car. The car later was found abandoned in the south of
Jerusalem, near the border with the West Bank, Ben-Ruby said.
	   Ben-Ruby said the assailants apparently were Palestinian
militants.
	   In the past, Palestinian militant groups have carried out a
number of drive-by shootings in hopes of wrecking
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
	   The last such attack came in August when two Jewish seminary
students were shot and killed outside the West Bank settlement of
Yitzhar.
	   Tuesday's shooting came two days before the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders were to meet in Washington in hopes of
concluding an agreement on a West Bank troop pullback.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Excerpts from the Royal Swedish Academy
of Sciences' Nobel Physics Prize citation. The prize went to Robert
C. Laughlin of the United States, Horst L. Stoermer of Germany and
Daniel C. Tsui, a China-born American citizen.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   The contributions of the three laureates have ... led to yet
another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum physics and to
the development of new theoretical concepts of significance in many
branches of modern physics.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   The three researchers (discovered) that electrons acting
together in strong magnetic fields can form new types of
``particles,'' with charges that are fractions of electron charges.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Stoermer and Tsui made the discovery in 1982 in an experiment
using extremely powerful magnetic fields and low temperatures.
Through theoretical analysis, (Laughlin) showed that the electrons
in a powerful magnetic field can condense to form a kind of quantum
fluid related to the quantum fluids that occur in superconductivity
and in liquid helium. What makes these fluids particularly
important for researchers is that events in a drop of quantum fluid
can afford more profound insights into the general inner structure
and dynamics of matter.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three U.S. based-physicists won the
Nobel Prize on Tuesday for discovering how electrons can change
their behavior, work that could lead to further advances in
microelectronics.
	   Robert C. Laughlin of the United States, Horst L. Stoermer of
Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a native of China who is now an
American citizen, will share the dlrs 978,000 prize.
	   They discovered that ordinary electrons acting together in
strong magnetic fields and very low temperatures can condense into
new types of composite subatomic particles that function as a
fluid, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. Subsequently,
other researchers confirmed their experiments and directly observed
these new composites, known as quasiparticles.
	   Laughlin, 47, works at Stanford University, Stoermer (pronounced
STER-mer), 49, currently is at Columbia University and Tsui
(TSOO-ee), 59, teaches at Princeton University. The award
recognizes work Tsui and Stoermer did together in 1982. Laughlin
elaborated on the work the next year.
	   Laughlin got the news in the middle of the night.
	   ``The reason why this is important is that it has to do with why
the universe is the way it is,'' he said today. ``You can chop (the
universe) to pieces or learn how all the pieces work together. This
is a triumph of the second.''
	   According to the citation, the three men discovered a new form
of ``quantum fluid'' _ fluids such as liquid helium that have
certain properties in common, such as superfluidity.
	   What makes these fluids important for researchers is that they
can reveal more about the inner structure and dynamics of matter.
	   It is ``yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics,'' the academy
said.
	   Mansour Shayegan, a colleague of Tsui's at Princeton, said all
three ``have done wonderful work.''
	   ``They have essentially discovered a new state of condensed
matter,'' he said.
	   Mats Jonson, a physics professor at Sweden's respected Chalmers
Institute of Technology, said the laureates' work could be
important in the development of smaller electronic components and
could lead to improving computer memories by manipulating electrons
in this altered state.
	   The development of microelectronics has allowed other
researchers to confirm the work's validity in experiments the
Academy likened to ``measuring the sound of individual hailstones
during a hailstorm.''
	   The trio's work built on experiments performed by German
physicist Klaus von Kiltzing, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in
1985.
	   The Nobel Prize in chemistry will be given out later Tuesday
morning.
	   Last year's physics laureates, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of France
and William Phillips and Steven Chu of the United States, were
honored for developing ways of trapping atoms of gas and cooling
them to within a millionth of a degree of absolute zero.
	   The work led to developing extraordinarily accurate atomic
clocks. Previous atomic clocks weren't exactly sloppy, being
accurate to about one second in 32 million years _ but the
improvements made possible a clock that loses just one second every
3 billion years.
	   It also led to the creation of an entirely new form of matter,
achieving what Albert Einstein had postulated was possible some 70
years earlier.
	   The 1997 chemistry winners, American Paul D. Boyer, John E.
Walker of Britain and Jens C. Skou of Denmark, discovered aspects
of how the body's cells store and use energy, a fundamental process
that affects everything from the building of bones to the
transmission of nerve impulses.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for discovering
properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but also a
life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   Their finding helped lead to the discovery of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra and could also pay off in new treatments for heart
disease, cancer and septic shock.
	   The literature prize was awarded Thursday to Portuguese novelist
Jose Saramago. The economics prize winner is to be named on
Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
	   All the prizes are announced in Stockholm, except for the peace
prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes
in his will.

KLA representative voices concern over verification force
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) _ The political leader of the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army expressed concern Tuesday over the safety of
members of an unarmed verification force which will oversee
compliance with the deal to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   Under the agreement, announced Monday, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic would guarantee the safety of the 2,000 members
of the force which will be deployed by the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   ``It's not the first time Milosevic has promised something,''
Bardhyl Mahmuti told The Associated Press by telephone.
	   ``It's not the first time Milosevic has promised something,''
Mahmuti said. ``We'll see what happens.''
	   He said he thought Milosevic would use unarmed observers as
``hostages,'' referring to the action by Bosnian Serbs in taking
U.N. troops captive during the Bosnian war.

Malaysian Muslim group protests arrest of its leader
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The arrest of the head of a Muslim
intellectual group hasn't scared its members from calling for
sweeping changes in Malaysia's government, a spokesman said
Tuesday.
	   Mohamed Hatta Shaharom, vice president of Jemaah Islah Malaysia,
or the Malaysian Reform Society, said the arrest Monday of its
president, Shaari Sungib, has only resulted in ``firing up''
members' spirits.
	   ``All members of JIM will double their effort in reformation
that it had always carried out along with the society,'' Mohamed
Hatta told reporters.
	   ``In Allah alone we put our trust. Allah is the most supreme and
the most harsh in retribution.''
	   The arrest of JIM's president brings to 18 the number of people
detained recently under the Internal Security Act, which allows
imprisonment without trial.
	   Since ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim was arrested
under the same law Sept. 20, two new opposition coalitions of
political parties and private groups have formed, calling for
abolition of the ISA and justice for the dissident politician.
	   JIM, a member of both coalitions, renewed its call for all
Malaysians to press for reform in the 17-year-old administration of
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Asia's longest-serving ruler.
	   ``Enough is enough, we've waited long enough,'' said Mohamed
Hatta. ``Any form of tyranny, any form of injustice must be wiped
out.''
	   Mahathir fired Anwar as his deputy and finance minister on Sept.
2, after they clashed over economic policies. Anwar now faces trial
on charges of sexual misconduct and corruption. He has denied guilt
on all charges.
	   Anwar's case has prompted Malaysians to publicly criticize their
government in a nation where state authority always went
unquestioned.
	   Malaysian parliamentary opposition leader Lim Kit Siang said his
party was ``shocked that the government is continuing with its
arbitrary arrests,'' and demanded the immediate release of all
political detainees.
	   The local human rights group Suaram condemned the government for
resorting to ``terror tactics'' and ``brutal repression'' to
squelch any dissent from Malaysians.
	   ``The frequent use of arbitrary detention under the ISA ...
shows that Dr. Mahathir has lost all his legitimacy as the leader
of Malaysia,'' said Elizabeth Wong, the group's spokeswoman.

Russia to expand role of foreign banks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with government threatening to print more money,
Central Bank chairman comments on foreign banks' role, government's
treasuries debt, government decision on oil and gas export duties
still on hold. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government promised Tuesday to expand the role
of foreign banks in Russia, and said it will print more money to
pay its bills unless international lenders deliver promised aid.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov reiterated that his government
has no plans to nationalize domestic banks, not even those on the
verge of bankruptcy.
	   But in a meeting with two dozen of the country's top bankers, he
expressed concern about a huge capital flight, which he put at dlrs
1.5 billion to dlrs 2 billion since the latest economic crisis
struck in mid-August. The Central Bank recently said the figure was
much higher.
	   No details were released of Primakov's plans for foreign banks,
which are currently not allowed to provide retail services in
Russia. All the major international banks have offices in Russia,
devoted mostly to corporate and investment services.
	   ``We cannot manage without expanding opportunities for foreign
banks in Russia, without the expansion of foreign capital in assets
of Russian banks,'' Primakov said, in remarks broadcast on national
television.
	   Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko later said at a news
conference that foreign banks were ``not ready yet'' to offer broad
retail services to Russian consumers, and expressed concern that
such services would fuel capital flight.
	   Gerashchenko said that Russian commercial banks could convert
their debts to foreign banks into shares. However, he said foreign
banks could not acquire more than 12 percent of all the capital in
Russia's banking system.
	   He also said the government expects to reach a deal with foreign
investors by the end of the month on new terms for repaying the
treasury bills it defaulted on in August.
	   Russians, mostly commercial banks, will be offered new
ruble-denominated bonds, he said. Foreigners will be offered
dollar-denominated bonds in exchange for the debt, but the
government will have a grace period of at least four years on
interest payments, Gerashchenko said.
	   While the government has no intention of nationalizing banks,
that does not mean it will rescue all those in trouble, Primakov
said. ``Our goal isn't to save all banks,'' he said.
	   Some commercial banks have failed as a result of the economic
crisis, and most have frozen accounts or allow only limited
transactions. The banks regularly run out of rubles and foreign
currencies sought by customers.
	   The government says it plans to make public its proposals to
overcome the crisis by Oct. 20. However, it acknowledges these will
be mostly stop-gap measures rather than a comprehensive, long-term
plan. Their content would hinge on whether the International
Monetary Fund releases the now-frozen installments of a dlrs 22.6
billion bailout package negotiated before the crisis hit.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said if the IMF money
is not forthcoming, Russia will have to print more money, which
most analysts say will lead to high inflation.
	   ``The talks (with the IMF) will continue, but if we are
cornered, we will have to agree to a restricted inflationary
mode,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   The IMF says it wants to see details of the government's
economic plan, plus signs it has been implemented, before it will
release more money.
	   Meanwhile, the government announced that crude oil exports
soared to 84.78 million metric tons (93.25 million short tons) in
the first eight months of 1998, up 10 percent over the same period
last year.
	   With world oil prices at their lowest level in a decade,
however, revenue fell 28 percent from last year to dlrs 6.68
billion, the State Statistics Committee said.
	   Russia had promised to cut oil exports in an effort to stabilize
world prices.
	   Fuel and Energy Minister Sergei Generalov said Tuesday that the
Cabinet hasn't made a final decision yet on whether to set export
duties on oil and gas companies _ an unpopular move aimed at
boosting sagging budget revenues.

Publisher behind popularity of American baseball in Japan dies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ikuo Ikeda, one of the first publishers to
introduce U.S. major league baseball to Japan, has died, his Tokyo
company said Tuesday. He was 58.
	   Ikeda, the president of Baseball Magazine Sha Co., died of liver
failure in a Tokyo hospital Monday.
	   An avid major league fan, Ikeda interviewed Reggie Jackson for
Weekly Baseball, his company's flagship 460,000-circulation
magazine, translated a book by Sparky Anderson and helped make
baseball cards popular in a nation that had never heard of them.
	   ``He took the first step to offer information about the major
league to Japanese readers,'' said Baseball Magazine Sha executive
Yoshiaki Sato.
	   ``It was a struggle just to find out how their names were
pronounced,'' Sato said, recalling Ikeda's efforts to put together
a book on major leaguers in the 1960s. ``Back then, what divided
the major league and Japanese baseball was bigger than the Berlin
Wall.''
	   From the start, Ikeda's publishing house was intent on covering
American stars, although initially in special editions that hardly
brought in profit, Sato said.
	   With Japan's Hideo Nomo and Hideki Irabu now major leaguers,
Baseball Magazine Sha Co. started its monthly Major League magazine
last year.
	   ``It's a very lucrative business these days,'' Sato said.
	   Ikeda had foreseen those days coming since his youth.
	   After graduating from Waseda University in Tokyo, Ikeda worked
in New York for three years to study American publishing, first at
Prentice Hall, then at Time-Life. He later attended a journalism
school in Budapest, Hungary.
	   While living in the United States, he developed friendships with
baseball club owners, including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner
Peter O'Malley.
	   In 1963, he joined Baseball Magazine Sha, which his father and
company chairman Tsuneo founded in 1946. The younger Ikeda became
vice president in 1982 and was named president a decade later.
	   Ikuo Ikeda also served as president of Kobunsha Co., a separate
publishing company also founded by his father, with about 600
titles, mostly books on art, history, literature and folk costumes
of Eastern European nations.
	   Active in friendship associations in Japan with Hungary and
Bulgaria, Ikeda believed that Japanese baseball, soccer and other
sports needed to learn from the rest of the world, said company
spokesman Hiroshi Yoshikawa.
	   Ikeda is survived by his wife Yuko and their son Tatsuo. Funeral
services are planned for Friday at Taisoji Temple in Tokyo.

Japanese political consensus seen forming to solve bank problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Asia-Economic Conference &QL; 
 &UR; By LAURINDA KEYS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ It has taken awhile, but a political consensus
is emerging in Japan on action to revive the ailing bank system,
Japanese business leaders and a high-ranking International Monetary
Fund official agreed Tuesday.
	   ``The problem is to muster sufficient political consensus to
implement the changes needed,'' Hubert Neiss, Asia-Pacific director
for the International Monetary Fund, told the East Asia Economic
Summit.
	   ``It appears a consensus is now emerging. The markets are
already reflecting a sense of optimism,'' Neiss said in a seminar
with top Japanese bank and business leaders.
	   ``The hardship from reform has just begun,'' said Koichi
Minaguchi, vice chairman and president of the leading business
organization, Keizai Doyukai. He agreed that Japan takes time to
build a consensus ``but it moves fast once a decision is made.''
	   ``From the standpoint of foreign observers it may be too little,
too late,'' Minaguchi said. ``But I believe the pace of reform will
accelerate in the future.''
	   However, Toru Kusukawa, chairman of the board of counselors at
Fuji Research Institution, indicated that the main thing foreign
experts want, increased Japanese consumer demand, is unlikely to
develop soon.
	   ``There are no indications consumers will spend a greater
proportion of their incomes any time soon,'' Kusukawa said,
explaining that many Japanese investors had suffered big foreign
losses and got their fingers burned again when the yen appreciated.
	   ``The last alternative remains the action of the Japanese
government,'' he said, urging agreement between the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party and the opposition.
	   ``The present economic situation is too serious to be sabotaged
and to be left in the political power game,'' Kusukawa said.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
proclaimed a breakthrough Tuesday in efforts to end the Kosovo
crisis after weeklong talks with President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   But, he warned, ``we're not out of the emergency yet.'' He said
it's up to Milosevic's government to prove its commitment to
international demands _ especially on allowing an international
verification force of 2,000 people into the Kosovo province.
	   In a rare national television address, Milosevic declared that
the agreements ``avert the danger of a military intervention
against our country.''
	   ``Our task is to accelerate the political process and economic
recovery of our country as a whole,'' Milosevic said. It was the
first time the Yugoslav president had addressed the nation since
the 1995 Dayton peace accords which ended the war in neighboring
Bosnia.
	   Tuesday's developments capped dramatic efforts to force an end
to Milosevic's crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists in the
southern province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Soon after NATO formally moved to the verge of airstrikes, U.S.
President Bill Clinton announced key concessions by Milosevic.
	   Before his television address, Milosevic said the agreement
demonstrated his government's commitment to the peace process, but
also reflected his position that the demands are unwarranted.
	   ``The steps which our country is taking to solve the Kosovo
problems by peaceful means show our firm commitment that all
questions can be solved by political means, but also the
determination to protect the country's territorial integrity and
sovereignty,'' he said in a statement.
	   Since the crackdown began Feb. 28, Milosevic has insisted the
crisis was an internal matter in which foreign powers should play
no role. The crackdown was aimed at crushing the Kosovo Liberation
Army, fighting for independence of the majority Albanian province,
which is a part of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo and hundreds of
thousands of people have been forced from their homes during the
seven-month operation.
	   International leaders stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis
because of fears that thousands of homeless refugees would die if
they could not return to their homes by the time winter sets in.
	   Yugoslavia expects that the verification mission, to be led by
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ``will
eliminate false, untrue and malicious reports about the situation
in Kosovo,'' Milosevic said in his statement.
	   To make sure Milosevic abides by the agreement, NATO agreed
early Tuesday on the final step needed to authorize airstrikes. The
16-nation alliance set a four-day deadline for Milosevic to begin
complying with international demands.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, an ethnic Albanian politician
who claims to speak for the KLA. said he was pleased by the NATO
action but expressed skepticism that Milosevic would live up to the
agreement.
	   The politician, Adem Demaci, said he was disappointed that the
verification force would be unarmed.
	   After late night meetings in Brussels, Holbrooke returned
immediately afterward to Belgrade and met briefly with Milosevic
for the eighth time in nine days.
	   ``We hope this will mark a turning point in the right direction.
But the proof ... is in compliance with U.N. resolution 1199 and
with actions on the ground in Kosovo,'' the U.S. trouble-shooter
said.
	   Shortly after NATO took its final step, Clinton announced that
Milosevic had agreed to withdraw his forces from Kosovo, initiate
autonomy negotiations with the separatist ethnic Albanians and
allow a force to verify compliance with U.N. demands.
	   Holbrooke, who noted that the deal will not affect existing
sanctions against Yugoslavia, said the key to the accord was
Milosevic's decision to let a 2,000-member ``verification mission''
and to permit ``aerial verification'' by noncombat aircraft that
could begin as soon as the end of the week.
	   Holbrooke said Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, head
of the OSCE, will soon come to Yugoslavia to sign the mission
agreement. NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark and Secretary-General
Javier Solana will also arrive to sign the aerial mission ``with
appropriate Yugoslav authorities,'' he said.
	   ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' Holbrooke said. ``They
are compliance verifiers.''
	   In addition, political negotiations with the ethnic Albanians
will continue in Kosovo, led by Christopher Hill, the U.S.
ambassador to Macedonia.
	   The ethnic Albanians, who form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2
million-strong population, have insisted on independence rather
than regaining the autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989.
	   But international leaders oppose Kosovo independence, fearing
that could lead to further instability in the tense Balkans. Some
Albanian militants want to establish a ``Greater Albania''
encompassing all Albanian-speaking communities in the southern
Balkans.
	   In Brussels, NATO sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Milosevic must take four steps: withdraw special troops from
Kosovo immediately, sign an agreement with the OSCE on the
verification mission, sign an agreement with NATO on the airborne
reconnaissance and hammer out a ``framework agreement'' by November
outlining future talks with ethnic Albanians.
	   The agreements with OSCE and NATO are expected to be signed
within days, the sources said.
	   Holbrooke emphasized that the U.S. delegation was not
proclaiming the talks a victory.
	   ``But if this is the road past the end of the emergency, ...
then we will feel it was worth coming here, we will feel that
international solidarity helped end the crisis,'' he said.

Early, late heroics lift Jags over Dolphins 28-21

	   JACKSONVILLE, Florida (AP) _ Mark Brunell hit Keenan McCardell
twice with fourth-quarter touchdown passes to rally Jacksonville to
a 28-21 victory over the Miami Dolphins and extend the Jaguars
unbeaten record to 5-0 in the American National Football League.
	   Brunell and McCardell combined on a 23-yard scoring pass with 12
minutes remaining to tie the game and then on a 56-yard scoring
strike with 2:36 remaining for the game winner.
	   The late TD wasn't the only big plays for the Jaguars, who got a
77-yard scoring run from rookie running back Fred Taylor on the
first play from scrimmage.
	   Jacksonville, Denver and Minnesota are the only undefeated teams
in the NFL. The Jaguars, who have won four games by a total of 18
points, took a two-game lead over second-place Pittsburgh in the
AFC Central Division.
	   Miami (3-2) fell one game behind AFC East leader New England.
	   The Dolphins squandered the best performance of the season by
Dan Marino, who had been handcuffed by conservative play-calling in
earlier games. He went 29-for-47 for 320 yards and two scores, but
he lost a fumble when sacked by Tony Brackens with two minutes
left, ending Miami's final threat at the Jacksonville 38.
	   Brackens, who both forced and recovered the fumble, was playing
for the first time this season after returning from an ankle
injury.
	   With the score tied and less than three minutes to go, Miami
coach Jimmy Johnson gambled by letting Olindo Mare try a 54-yard
field goal, and the strategy backfired. Mare was wide right, and
McCardell beat Terrell Buckley long on the next play to break the
tie.
	   A crowd of 74,051, the largest in the Jaguars' four-year
history, watched Jacksonville win shorthanded in the first meeting
between Florida's two AFC teams. Taylor left the game in the third
period because of a bruised shoulder, and Pro Bowl receiver Jimmy
Smith sat out the second half with a strained hamstring.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli man was killed and a second
critically wounded in a drive-by shooting Tuesday, and police said
the assailants apparently were Palestinian militants.
	   The incident occurred near Ora, a communal farm west of
Jerusalem.
	   Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said the victims were
bathing in a spring near Ora when shots were fired at them from a
passing car. The car later was found abandoned in the south of
Jerusalem, near the border with the West Bank, Ben-Ruby said.
	   Ben-Ruby said the assailants apparently were Palestinian
militants.
	   In the past, Palestinian militant groups have carried out a
number of drive-by shootings in hopes of wrecking
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
	   The last such attack came in August when two Jewish seminary
students were killed outside the West Bank settlement of Yitzhar.
	   Tuesday's shooting came two days before the Israeli and
Palestinian leaders were to meet in Washington in hopes of
concluding an agreement on a West Bank troop pullback.

Thailand holds seminar on radioactive waste management
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Officials from nine East Asian
countries on Tuesday began a two-day regional seminar on
radioactive waste management to try to establish a future vision
and management practices in the field.
	   About 30 scientists, engineers and administrators are attending
the conference, which deals with the exchange of information and
regulatory and technical aspects of nuclear waste disposal. It is
the fourth such meeting, conducted in the framework of a
Japanese-funded initiative on Asian regional nuclear cooperation.
	   Kriengsak Bhadrakom, secretary-general of Thailand's Office of
Atomic Energy for Peace, said in opening remarks that he believed
that scientists and other concerned parties could use the meeting
to publicize successful strategies of radioactive waste management
among a skeptical public.
	   After the meeting, the visiting foreign delegates will be given
a three-day tour of nuclear facilities and regulatory centers in
north and northeast Thailand.

Netanyahu seeks Cabinet backing for agreement with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with fatal shooting near Jerusalem, protest
outside prime minister's office, Arafat quote &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Cabinet hardliners asked Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday to link a West Bank troop pullback to
Palestinian security guarantees, and an Israeli swimming in a
spring was shot dead in an attack blamed on Palestinian militants.
	   The shooting and the hardliners' demands came a day before
Netanyahu was to leave for Washington for meetings with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton is pushing the two to conclude an
agreement on a long-overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   Palestinian militants have carried out a series of drive-by
shootings in recent years in hopes of wrecking peace talks.
	   In Tuesday's attack, assailant fired from a pistol at two
Israeli men bathing in a spring near the communal farm of Ora west
of Jerusalem, said police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby. One man was
killed and the second critically wounded, the spokesman said. The
assailants' car was later found abandoned near the West Bank.
	   In a special Cabinet meeting, ministers from the National
Religious Party demanded that Netanyahu not hand over any land to
the Palestinians unless they extradite suspects in attacks on
Israelis and cancel clauses in the PLO founding charter that call
for the destruction of Israel, said party spokesman Joshua
Mor-Yosef.
	   In addition, the NRP stipulated that Netanyahu not sign a
withdrawal agreement unless the scope of an additional pullback is
decided on now, Mor-Yosef said.
	   If Netanyahu wraps up a deal without meeting these conditions
the NRP will bring down the government, Mor-Yosef said. The party,
the patron of the Jewish settlement movement in the West Bank and
Gaza, has enough seats in the 120-member parliament to rob
Netanyahu of his parliamentary majority.
	   A government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Netanyahu will support the NRP's demands on security and the PLO
Charter, but will not agree to any formal Cabinet decision
restricting his power to negotiate.
	   Also Tuesday, several leading hawks in the ruling coalition
threatened to challenge Netanyahu in the next elections and field
their own candidate for prime minister if he agrees to a troop
withdrawal. Among those poised to challenge the prime minister are
two legislators from Netanyahu's Likud Party, Uzi Landau and Benny
Begin, son of the late Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
	   Outside the prime minister's office, several dozen Jewish
settlers, many from the divided West Bank town of Hebron, demanded
that Netanyahu make no more concessions to the Palestinians.
	   Noam Arnon, a spokesman for the 450 Jewish settlers in Hebron,
said that any land handed to the Palestinians is used as a base for
future attacks on Israelis. ``Every inch you give is an inch for
terror,'' Arnon said.
	   Netanyahu has agreed in principle to hand over 13 percent of the
West Bank, with some restrictions. The key issue to be tackled in
Washington is to work out an agreement on what constitutes a good
faith Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat many differences remained.
``There's a lot to be solved, if not here, then there (in
Washington),'' Arafat told reporters.
	   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, said the Washington summit
would be decisive. ``Either we reach a breakthrough or a dangerous
deadlock,'' he said. ``After that, no one can predict what will
happen in the area which is sitting atop a volcano.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton telephoned Netanyahu and Arafat on
Monday and urged them to make the decisions necessary to achieve an
agreement when they meet Thursday at Wye Plantation, Maryland.
	   Clinton said he would make every effort to conclude the
agreement on the troop withdrawal so that negotiations can begin on
the permanent settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.

Milosevic says agreement averts danger of armed attack in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic said
Tuesday that his agreement on Kosovo with a special U.S. envoy had
averted ``the danger of a military intervention against our
country.''
	   In his rare television address, Milosevic referred to threats of
NATO airstrikes if he did not agree to halt the seven-month
crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists in the southern
Kosovo province.
	   ``I want to inform you that an agreement has been reached to
solve the problems through a peaceful way and by political means,''
a somber Milosevic said. ``The agreement we reached eliminate the
danger of an armed intervention against our country.''
	   He said that despite the ``enormous pressure that we were
exposed to over the past years ... and especially in the past weeks
and days, the determination pervaded that solution can be found
only peacefully.''
	   The agreements reached are ``in accordance with the interests of
our country, with the interest of Republic of Serbia and all of its
citizens and ethnic communities.''
	   ``The political solution is aimed at the equality of all nations
in Kosovo,'' he added.
	   Milosevic then thanked all who, as he said, expressed support to
him during the talks, helping him to ``preserve the territorial
integrity and sovereignty of our country,'' and that ``problems in
the southern Serbian province be solved in a peaceful way.
	   ``I think we have achieved that. I thank you all.''

Albanian government expresses skepticism over Milosevic agreement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The Albanian government reacted carefully
Tuesday to Slobodan Milosevic's agreement to end the Kosovo crisis,
saying the Yugoslav leader has backed off from deals in the past.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Sokol Gjoka told the government news
agency ATA that ``we hope this time, Milosevic will not play with
his promises, like he has done in the past.''
	   ``It is not the first time he has made promises,'' Gjoka said.
``In the past, he has always disillusioned the international
community. We hope he will not do the same again.''
	   Thousands of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo province have fled to
Albania since Milosevic launched his crackdown Feb. 28 on
separatists of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The KLA maintains sanctuaries near the Yugoslav border in
northern Albania.

Juvenile crime rises in Japan in 1997
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan may still be one of the safest nations on
earth but the number of crimes reported last year rose to a postwar
high as offenses committed by teen-agers rose almost 10 percent, a
government report said Tuesday.
	   Crimes by teen-agers, including two murders last year by a high
school student in Kobe, have raised a national debate on adopting
stricter juvenile laws.
	   The number of arrests among those aged 14 to 19 on suspicion of
crimes ranging from petty offenses to theft and murder rose 9.8
percent in 1997 to 215,600, according to the Justice Ministry's
1998 White Paper on Crime.
	   For every 1,000 children aged 10 to 19, 14.2 were arrested last
year, the report said. The number of minors arrested on suspicion
of robbery increased 60 percent to 1,701.
	   A survey of 117 minors detained for serious crimes such as
murder or attempted murder showed that 44 percent had been abused
or bullied as youngsters while 16 percent had attempted suicide.
	   The report did not say how the numbers compared to the general
population.
	   Japan's Justice Ministry is preparing a bill to lower the age at
which criminal offenders can be punished.
	   The beheading of a schoolboy by a Kobe high school student last
year, along with a spate of knife attacks by young people, have
triggered calls for tougher punishments for teen-age criminals.
	   Japan's juvenile law applies to people under 20 years old and
assigns the cases to family courts. People 16 years or older can be
tried in a criminal court.
	   Overall, the number of reported crimes in Japan was up 2.2
percent in 1997 to 2.52 million cases, the most in Japan's postwar
history.
	   Theft was the most common, accounting for two-thirds of all
crimes. A quarter of reported crimes were traffic related.
	   Arrest were made in some 40 percent of the reported crimes, the
report said.

Russia to send parliamentary delegation to Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Foreign Ministry welcoming agreement, Defense
Ministry saying it would offer military aid, delegation to leave
Thursday sted Wednesday. TRIMS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Foreign Ministry welcomed the apparent
breakthrough in the Kosovo crisis on Tuesday, while the Defense
Ministry said Russia would give Yugoslavia military help if NATO
went ahead with airstrikes.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said Russia would
probably take part in an international observation force put
together by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
	   ``It is now time to work out and coordinate the mandate'' of the
force, Rakhmanin said, welcoming an agreement mediated by U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   The agreement at least temporarily averts NATO airstrikes and
calls for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his
forces from Kosovo, begin peace negotiations and allow the
international observers into the troubled province.
	   But the Defense Ministry issued a statement warning ``Russia
will provide military and military-technical aid to Yugoslavia,''
Interfax reported.
	   The ministry also said that if there were airstrikes, Russia
would be unlikely to ratify the START II nuclear arms reduction
treaty with the United States and will have ``to look for possible
(new) military allies to preserve the military balance.''
	   The statement said Russia would also likely respond by revising
its relationship with NATO, including its participation in the
Partnership for Peace program.
	   Responding to threats from the Russian military to break the
arms embargo against Yugoslavia, President Boris Yeltsin's
spokesman said it was up to the Russian leader to make foreign
policy. Yeltsin is at home sick this week, recovering from a
respiratory infection.
	   Russia opposes NATO airstrikes against Serbia, which makes up
most of present-day Yugoslavia. Russia and Serbia are allies, both
being Slavic countries that practice the Orthodox Christian
religion.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian parliament voted Tuesday to send a
delegation to Kosovo, and its speaker urged Russia's Slavic
neighbors to do the same thing.
	   The four-member delegation will leave Thursday to study the
situation in Kosovo and visit ``a number of sites'' that NATO was
likely to target, said Sergei Baburin, the deputy speaker of the
State Duma, the lower house of parliament, who will lead the
expedition.
	   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said ``it would be good if our
colleagues, friends and allies, deputies from Belarus or Ukraine,
would also send their people.''
	   ``We are all Slavs, and this question must be resolved by us
together,'' Seleznyov said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Ukraine has offered to help mediate a peaceful solution to the
crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, while Belarus has offered
military aid to Yugoslavia in the event it is targeted by NATO.
	   Russia's Movement for Support of the Armed Forces, a political
group formed to push for Yeltsin's ouster, said it was ready to
send its members to Yugoslavia to organize resistance to NATO. It
also hinted at acts of resistance in Russia itself.
	   ``In view of the growing anti-NATO and anti-American mood in
Russia, it is impossible to guarantee that no hostile acts will be
carried out against diplomats and other representatives of NATO
member states working in Moscow,'' said Viktor Ilyukhin, who leads
the movement as well as parliament's security committee.

Parliament amends constitution to elect army chief as president

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanon passed a constitutional amendment
Tuesday that clears the way to elect the army's commander, Gen.
Emile Lahoud, as president.
	   Lahoud has received the backing of Syria, the main power broker
in the country, making his election by the pro-Syrian Parliament
just a formality during the vote scheduled for Thursday.
	   A total of 113 parliamentary deputies voted for the amendment
and four against, including the general's cousin, Nassib Lahoud, a
presidential aspirant. Eleven deputies were absent.
	   Among those who were absent was Walid Jumblatt, a Cabinet
minister who had said he would boycott the session to protest the
choice of a military man even though Lahoud has wide public and
political support.
	   Outgoing President Elias Hrawi signed the constitutional
amendment later Tuesday and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri called
the 128-member legislature into session on Thursday for the vote.
	   The amendment to Article 49 of the constitution revokes a ban on
senior civil servants from running for the presidency.
	   The new president will be sworn in Nov. 24, the day Hrawi leaves
office. Hrawi has served for nine years, including a three-year
extension in 1995 to his six-year term.
	   Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic, will keep alive a 55-year-old
tradition under which the president is a Maronite, the prime
minister a Sunni Muslim and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Muslim.
	   Lahoud, appointed army commander in 1989 amid a rebellion in the
fractured military during the 1975-90 civil war, is credited with
rebuilding the 55,000-strong Lebanese army and in ending the reign
of militias.
	   Many hope he will copy his success with the military in the
government, which is plagued by nepotism and waste of public funds.
But some fear of military dominance of public life.

Krupp advisory board approves Thyssen merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ESSEN, Germany (AP) _ The advisory board of Krupp on Tuesday
unanimously approved a merger with its longtime competitor Thyssen
to create one of Europe's largest industrial firms.
	   The Thyssen board is expected to likewise approve the merger
during a meeting Thursday. The deal, approved by European Union
officials, also requires a vote by stockholders and is expected to
take effect next March.
	   The combined company would be Germany's fifth largest industrial
concern, behind electronics giant Siemens and carmaker Volkswagen,
employing 180,000 people with 70 billion marks (dlrs 38 billion) in
annual sales.
	   Last year, the two companies merged their steel operations to
create Europe's largest steelmaker, in a move that led to talks on
a full merger.
	   Thyssen AG, based in Duesseldorf, has operations in capital
goods, manufactured products, trading and services, in addition to
steel.
	   Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp resulted from the merger of German steel
and engineering groups Krupp AG and Hoesch AG in December 1992.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Galvanized by a national show of force, high school
students again took to the streets across France Tuesday to protest
crowded classes and to demand better education tools.
	   The marches disrupted traffic in cities from Rennes, in
northwest France, to Toulouse, in the south. Police watched
closely, mindful of violence that marred several protests
nationwide Monday.
	   About 16,000 students rallied in downtown Bordeaux, southwestern
France, chanting and holding aloft banners saying ``Mobilization.
Action for Good Conditions.''
	   It was a similar picture in a dozen other cities: 10,000
students rallied in Rennes, at least 6,000 had gathered in Toulouse
two hours before a march, and a few thousand in smaller towns such
as Clermont-Ferrand, in central France.
	   Most of the rallies were peaceful, but in Lille, northern
France, a dozen youths were detained for smashing windows and
damaging parked cars during a rally by at least 2,000 students.
	   On Monday in Paris, where 10,000 people had rallied, 13 people
were detained, although only five remained in custody Tuesday.
	   Everywhere, police said the show of force appeared stronger
Tuesday.
	   Students, who began the school year in early September, warn
they will stay off school and continue their protests unless the
government comes up with funds to solve overcrowded classrooms, and
provide better equipment, such as computers.
	   In Paris Monday, two police officers were injured in violence in
shopping centers and avenues. Six cars were damaged and the windows
of several stores and phone booths were smashed.
	   Late Monday, a student delegation met at the Education Ministry
with Bernard Toulemonde, director of scholastic instruction. He
reminded the group that the government had already announced the
creation of 3,000 new posts for teachers for next year and 20,000
student jobs.

Jospin signals opposition to EU farm spending reform plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on
Tuesday told the European Union he would oppose plans to shift the
burden for subsidizing farmers from the EU common budget to
national treasuries.
	   ``In principle we do not favor a re-nationalization of the
common agricultural policy,'' Jospin told a news conference at EU
headquarters.
	   ``Since we agree that we want to rein in community spending,
then we must deal with the issue at community level.''
	   Jospin spoke after talks with European Commission President
Jacques Santer on planned reforms and budget cuts at the EU before
the Union can expand into eastern Europe.
	   One of the planned budget-saving measures includes letting
governments pay only 75 percent of their contributions to the EU
farm budget and distribute the rest directly to farmers from
national budgets.
	   This would allow the EU to save about dlrs 8 billion a year, but
has provoked objections from France and other nations with large
agricultural sectors.
	   The wrangle over spending is expected to dominate an Oct. 24-25
summit of EU leaders in Austria, and drag on until a deadline for
wrapping up the reform next June.
	   Jospin said the EU should do more to encourage growth and fight
unemployment. ``With the right political will, Europe has the means
to be a zone of relative growth over the next 10 to 15 years.''

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ About 25,000 Iraqi women marched through
the streets Tuesday in a government-organized demonstration to
express anger at U.N. trade sanctions.
	   It was the largest women's protest in Baghdad since the
sanctions were imposed on Iraq in 1990 to punish it for invading
Kuwait.
	   The women carried anti-American placards and shouted slogans
against the U.S. government. ``America is the enemy of God,'' they
screamed as they approached the offices of the U.N. Development
Program in Baghdad where the organizers handed a letter of protest.
	   Most of the women were clothed in black veils and many slapped
their faces and beat their breasts at the sight of pick-up cars
carrying symbolic coffins of children.
	   Authorities say thousands of children have died because of
medicine shortages caused by the sanctions.
	   Rfa Ma'rouf, a doctor at a Baghdad children's hospital, said
about 200 babies die every day in her hospital. ``Our children are
dying. They are innocent and no one cares,'' she said.
	   Hana' Mahmoud said she joined the demonstration to tell the
world that Iraqi children cannot be held responsible for what
happened.
	   ``They are not guilty. They have done nothing but they bear the
brunt of sanctions,'' she said.
	   Iraq has often used such processions to win world sympathy and
support for the lifting of sanctions.
	   The sanctions on Iraq will only be lifted when U.N. weapons
inspectors testify that Baghdad has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke wrapped
up week-long talks with President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday and
proclaimed a breakthrough in efforts to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   But, he warned, ``we're not out of the emergency yet.'' He said
it's up to Milosevic's government to prove its commitment to
international demands it has agreed to honor.
	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw his forces from Kosovo,
begin peace negotiations with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow
some 2,000 international observers into the troubled Serb province.
	   In a rare national television address, the Yugoslav leader
declared that the agreements ``avert the danger of a military
intervention against our country.''
	   ``Our task is to accelerate the political process and economic
recovery of our country as a whole,'' Milosevic said. It was the
first time the Yugoslav president had addressed the nation since
the 1995 Dayton peace accords which ended the war in neighboring
Bosnia.
	   Tuesday's developments capped a dramatic series of developments
to force an end to Milosevic's crackdown against ethnic Albanian
separatists in the southern Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   In rapid succession, NATO formally moved to the verge of
airstrikes and U.S. President Bill Clinton announced key
concessions by Milosevic.
	   Before his television address, Milosevic issued a statement
saying the agreement demonstrated his government's commitment to
the peace process, but also reflected his position that the demands
are unwarranted.
	   ``The steps which our country is taking to solve the Kosovo
problems by peaceful means show our firm commitment that all
questions can be solved by political means, but also the
determination to protect the country's territorial integrity and
sovereignty,'' the statement said.
	   Since the crackdown began Feb. 28, Milosevic has insisted the
crisis was an internal matter in which foreign powers should play
no role. The crackdown was aimed at crushing the Kosovo Liberation
Army, fighting for independence of the majority Albanian province,
which is a part of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   Yugoslavia expects that the verification mission, to be led by
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ``will
eliminate false, untrue and malicious reports about the situation
in Kosovo,'' Milosevic said in his statement.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo and hundreds of
thousands of people have been forced from their homes during the
seven-month operation.
	   International leaders stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis
because of fears that thousands of homeless refugees would die if
they could not return to their homes by the time winter sets in.
	   To make sure Milosevic abides by the agreement, NATO agreed
early Tuesday on the final step needed to authorize airstrikes. The
16-nation alliance set a four-day deadline for Milosevic to begin
complying with international demands.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, an ethnic Albanian politician
who claims to speak for the KLA. said he was pleased by the NATO
action but expressed skepticism that Milosevic would live up to the
agreement.
	   The politician, Adem Demaci, said he was disappointed that the
verification force would be unarmed.
	   In neighboring Albanian, Foreign Ministry spokesman Sokol Gjoka
said he hoped Milosevic ``will not play with his promises, like he
has done in the past.'' Kosovo rebels maintain sanctuaries in
northern Albanian.
	   After late night meetings in Brussels, Holbrooke returned
immediately afterward to Belgrade and met briefly with Milosevic
for the eighth time in nine days.
	   ``We hope this will mark a turning point in the right direction.
But the proof ... is in compliance with U.N. resolution 1199 and
with actions on the ground in Kosovo,'' the U.S. trouble-shooter
told a news conference before planning to head for New York.
	   NATO took its decision after Holbrooke flew to alliance
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, to brief ambassadors on his
talks with Milosevic.
	   Holbrooke, who noted that the deal will not affect existing
sanctions against Yugoslavia, said the key to the accord was
Milosevic's decision to allow a 2,000-member ``verification
mission'' and to permit ``aerial verification'' by non-combat
aircraft that could begin as soon as the end of the week.
	   Holbrooke said Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, head
of the OSCE, will soon come to Yugoslavia to sign the mission
agreement. NATO commander Gen. Wesley Clark and Secretary-General
Javier Solana will also arrive to sign the aerial mission ``with
appropriate Yugoslav authorities,'' he said.
	   ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' Holbrooke said. ``They
are compliance verifiers.''
	   In addition, political negotiations with the ethnic Albanians
will continue in Kosovo, led by Christopher Hill, the U.S.
ambassador to Macedonia.
	   The ethnic Albanians, who form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2
million-strong population, have insisted on independence rather
than regaining the autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989.
	   But international leaders oppose Kosovo independence, fearing
that could lead to further instability in the tense Balkans. Some
Albanian militants want to establish a ``Greater Albania''
encompassing all Albanian-speaking communities in the southern
Balkans.
	   In Brussels, NATO sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Milosevic must take four steps: withdraw special troops from
Kosovo immediately, sign an agreement with the OSCE on the
verification mission, sign an agreement with NATO on the airborne
reconnaissance and hammer out a ``framework agreement'' by November
outlining future talks with ethnic Albanians.
	   The agreements with OSCE and NATO are expected to be signed
within days, the sources said.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three U.S. based-physicists won the
Nobel Prize on Tuesday for discovering how electrons can change
their behavior, work that could lead to further advances in
microelectronics.
	   Robert B. Laughlin of the United States, Horst L. Stoermer of
Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a native of China who is now an
American citizen, will share the dlrs 978,000 prize.
	   They discovered that ordinary electrons acting together in
strong magnetic fields and very low temperatures can condense into
new types of composite subatomic particles that function as a
fluid, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. Subsequently,
other researchers confirmed their experiments and directly observed
these new composites, known as quasiparticles.
	   Laughlin works at Stanford University, Stoermer (pronounced
STER-mer) currently is at Columbia University and Tsui (TSOO-ee)
teaches at Princeton University. The award recognizes work Tsui and
Stoermer did together in 1982. Laughlin elaborated on the work the
next year.
	   Laughlin, 47, who did his graduate studies at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, got the news in the middle of the night.
	   ``The reason why this is important is that it has to do with why
the universe is the way it is,'' he said today. ``You can chop (the
universe) to pieces or learn how all the pieces work together. This
is a triumph of the second.''
	   According to the citation, the three men discovered a new form
of ``quantum fluid'' _ fluids such as liquid helium that have
certain properties in common, such as superfluidity.
	   What makes these fluids important for researchers is that they
can reveal more about the inner structure and dynamics of matter.
	   It is ``yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics,'' the academy
said.
	   Mansour Shayegan, a colleague of Tsui's at Princeton, said all
three ``have done wonderful work.''
	   ``They have essentially discovered a new state of condensed
matter,'' he said.
	   Mats Jonson, a physics professor at Sweden's respected Chalmers
Institute of Technology, said the laureates' work could be
important in the development of smaller electronic components and
could lead to improving computer memories by manipulating electrons
in this altered state.
	   The development of microelectronics has allowed other
researchers to confirm the work's validity in experiments the
Academy likened to ``measuring the sound of individual hailstones
during a hailstorm.''
	   The trio's work built on experiments performed by German
physicist Klaus von Kiltzing, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in
1985.
	   Tsui, 59, was born in Henan, China, in 1939. He came to the
United States in 1958 to attend Augustana College in Rock Island,
Illinois. He received his doctorate in physics from the University
of Chicago and was appointed a professor at Princeton in 1982.
	   Stoermer received his doctorate in physics from Stuggart
University. He joined Columbia this year after supervising the
Physical Research Laboratory at Bell Laboratories since 1992.
	   The Nobel Prize in chemistry will be given out later Tuesday.
	   Last year's physics laureates, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of France
and William Phillips and Steven Chu of the United States, were
honored for developing ways of trapping atoms of gas and cooling
them to within a millionth of a degree of absolute zero. The work
led to developing extraordinarily accurate atomic clocks.
	   The 1997 chemistry winners, American Paul D. Boyer, John E.
Walker of Britain and Jens C. Skou of Denmark, discovered aspects
of how the body's cells store and use energy, a fundamental process
that affects everything from the building of bones to the
transmission of nerve impulses.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for discovering
properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but also a
life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   Their finding helped lead to the discovery of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra.
	   The literature prize was awarded Thursday to Portuguese novelist
Jose Saramago. The economics prize winner is to be named on
Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
	   All the prizes are announced in Stockholm, except for the peace
prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes
in his will.

Congolese rebels control Kindu town and air base

	   KINDU, Congo (AP) _ Victorious Congolese rebels patrolled this
town on the Congo River Tuesday after defeating 5,000 government
troops in an eight-day battle that stopped a vaunted
counteroffensive by President Laurent Kabila.
	   Thousands of exhausted but triumphant rebel troops carrying
Kalashnikov rifles, mortars and rocket-launchers lounged on both
banks of the wide, muddy river.
	   The victory opens the routes to diamond-rich Mbuji-Mayi, 440
kilometers (273 miles) to the southwest and to mineral-rich Katanga
province, Kabila's home, to the south.
	   There is no bridge over the Congo at Kindu, and rebels, whose
numbers had swelled to 9,000, crossed at night in a few inflatable
boats to capture the capital of Maniema province, 380 kilometers
(235 miles) west of the rebel stronghold of Goma on the Rwandan
border.
	   Maj. Siatilo Ngizo, who commanded the assault Sunday on Kindu,
said his forces had managed to cut off all means of supply and
reinforcement to government troops, most of whom fled towards the
southwest.
	   Ngizo, a paratrooper commander in the army of the late dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko, was at the head of Zairean army forces who lost
the February 1997 battle for Kindu as rebels swept across the
former Zaire in eight months to oust Mobutu and install Kabila in
his place.
	   Kindu air base, 4 kilometers (2 miles) north of town and the
main objective in the battle, showed surprisingly little damage
after eight days of rebel shelling.
	   Ammunition boxes were scattered across the tarmac, and most
installations appeared intact. Ngizo said no mines had been found
at the perimeter, and rebel flights from Goma would begin arriving
later Tuesday.
	   Ngizo said his forces had captured two functioning Chinese-made
multiple rocket launchers mounted on trucks at the airport.
	   The wide, tree-lined streets of Kindu were deserted of vehicles
and people. Residents had taken refuge in the surrounding forests,
and government forces had made off with cars and trucks, rebel
officers said. Ngizo said some people had started to return.
	   He said there were many casualties on both sides.
	   Among the 1,337 prisoners taken by the rebels were Sudanese,
Chadian and Angolan troops, he said.
	   ``This is a big victory for us,'' Arthur Mulunda, another rebel
commander, said. ``Kabila wanted to use Kindu for a big
counter-offensive. He cannot do anything now. Mbuji-Mayi is next.''
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted members of Kabila's
army and opposition politicians _ have been reinforced with troops
and weapons from neighboring Rwanda.
	   Kabila has so far refused to negotiate with the rebels, accusing
them of being the puppets of Rwanda and neighboring Uganda _ the
two countries that helped put him in power in May 1997.
	   Both countries say they have legitimate security interests in
eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the border area
of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
	   Intervention in mid-August by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and
Namibia stopped a rebel blitzkrieg from the west at the outskirts
of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   Since then, the rebels had been contained in their eastern
strongholds, including the city of Kisangani in north-central
Congo.
	   It was not clear what had happened to a Boeing 727 airplane
Saturday rebel leaders in Goma claimed to have shot down as it was
preparing to land in Kindu with 40 government troops and
ammunition.
	   Congo Airlines, which owned the aircraft, said the victims were
civilians fleeing fighting in Kindu. There was no independent
confirmation.

Pro-Indonesians stage protest against governor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ A small group of East Timorese staged a
protest Tuesday, demanding that the provincial governor quit after
he threatened to fire government employees who don't support an
Indonesian proposal to grant autonomy, but not independence, to the
troubled territory.
	   The protest by about 50 pro-Indonesian activists came after two
days of mass demonstrations by thousands of separatist supporters
who demanded a referendum on independence for the former Portuguese
colony.
	   Indonesia has rejected the demand and instead has offered to
grant autonomy to the province in connection with U.N.-sponsored
talks with Portugal.
	   Recently, East Timor Gov. Jose Abilio Osorio Soares created a
furor when he said that civil servants in the province must support
the autonomy proposal or be fired.
	   Although Tuesday's protesters want East Timor to be part of
Indonesia and support the plan for autonomy, they said they were
angered by Soares' behavior.
	   ``Abilio a liar'' and ``Abilio has to step down'' were among
banners waved by the Tuesday protesters who marched down the
streets in Dili.
	   As with previous protests, they were also blocked from entering
the compound of the governor's office.
	   Similar protests by pro-independence East Timorese were also
held Monday in the coastal towns of Baucau and Liquisa, east and
west of Dili, East Timor's capital.
	   Coinciding with the Monday demonstration, prison wardens at
Dili's main penitentiary of Bekora fired warning shots at prisoners
protesting temporary cancellation of family visits.
	   One prisoner was wounded in the leg, and was under treatment,
said prison chief Mayun Mataram.
	   He said the cancellation followed the escape of 15 prisoners
Saturday as the main door was opened for the visitors.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976 after invading the previous
year during a civil war. The United Nations, however, does not
recognize Indonesia's sovereignty over the half-island territory.

Schroeder to attend EU summit in Austria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's future chancellor, Gerhard
Schroeder, will break away from the business of forming a new
government to attend a European Union summit Oct. 24-25 in Austria,
a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Schroeder will attend the opening day of the summit, but will

World Bank optimistic about Bulgaria's economic growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria's economy is expected to grow
steadily despite ripples of global financial turmoil, a World Bank
official told a meeting of foreign investors Tuesday in this
formerly communist country.
	   ``We need to be able to explain to an international business
community, which may be somewhat frightened by the turbulence in
the global emerging markets, that ... Bulgaria has its own story to
tell,'' said Andrew Vorkink, World Bank director for Bulgaria.
	   He addressed some 1,200 foreign businessmen at Bulgaria's
Investment Forum. The two-day meeting intended to drum up support
for market reforms in this Balkan country of 8.5 million opened
Tuesday.
	   ``Democratic process and settling of free market mechanisms are
thoroughly irreversible in Bulgaria,'' President Petar Stoyanov
told participants in the meeting. ``Chaos and unpredictability will
never return to my country.''
	   Vorkink said the World Bank expects Bulgaria's economy to grow
up to 5 percent next year, continuing a 4-percent growth projected
by the government this year.
	   Bulgaria's vice premier Aleksandar Bozhkov predicted 4-percent
growth in 1999. He added this figure could be one percent up or
down, depending on external impact.
	   ``Bulgaria has stayed protected and insulated from the adverse
effects,'' Vorkink said. ``We are optimistic about the continuing
growth of Bulgaria's economy.''
	   A pro-reform government, enjoying stable parliamentary support,
and a currency board at the central bank that bars it from printing
money to cover fiscal deficits are at the core of Bulgaria's
success story.
	   But experts have repeatedly noted that the country's
underdeveloped stock market has also kept the contagion of global
crisis away.
	   Foreign investment in Bulgaria has totaled dlrs 1.4 billion
since 1990. Some 500 million of them came last year after the
government of Premier Ivan Kostov embarked on an ambitious
privatization program, putting on the block the largest state
industries, banks and facilities including the national air carrier
Balkan, and the national telecommunications company.
	   Privatization of main state industries and all banks must be
completed by the end of 2000, Bozhkov told the meeting.

	   --
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ The main independent human rights group in
Zambia urged the government to back the lifting of international
sanctions against Nigeria.
	   Zambia has long been an influential member of the Commonwealth
of Britain, which imposed economic sanctions on Nigeria and
suspended the West African nation from the organization to isolate
its military dictatorship.
	   Ngande Mwanajiti, head of the Inter African Network for Human
Rights and Development, said Monday that moves toward democracy by
Gen. Abdusalam Abubakar after the death of Nigerian leader Gen.
Sani Abacha should be rewarded by the Commonwealth.
	   An end to sanctions also would signal progress toward democracy
in a continent riven by wars and conflict, he said.
	   Zambia has not publicly supported suggestions by some
Commonwealth countries to ease the economic embargo on Nigeria on
condition democratic elections are held after years of military
rule.
	   --
	   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Factory hands who showed up for work
in their underwear to demand new overalls were sent on paid leave
until their firm can find enough the money buy protective clothing,
the owners said.
	   The refusal by dozens of male workers Monday to put on their
clothes forced a ceramics company to shut down some of its
operations and reassign women workers, who were offended by the
men's behavior, to new tasks, said company Chairman Peter
Mkwananzi.
	   He said the ceramics company was owed 540,000 Zimbabwe dollars
(dlrs 18,000), mostly by the government, in long overdue fees for
its clay power insulators. Workers were last issued with new
protective clothing three years ago.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The prosecution has come up with key
original documents to bolster their case that defendants in the
Goldenberg financial scandal defrauded the government of millions
of dollars in a phony export compensation scheme, news reports said
Tuesday.
	   The official in charge of policing bank fraud, Joseph Mwangi,
told the court he found the documents in Central Bank of Kenya
cabinets that had remained closed since 1993, the East African
Standard said.
	   The documents, which witnesses last week told the court had been
burned, are the originals that demonstrate how the defendants
organized the fraud, the newspaper said.
	   The four defendants, who include businessman Kamlesh Pattni,
former CBK and former Treasury employees and a foreign exchange
dealer, are charged with fraudulently obtaining 5.8 billion Kenya
shillings (dlrs 83 million at 1992-93 rates) from the Central Bank
of Kenya as compensatory payment for gold, diamonds and other
jewels allegedly exported from Kenya by a firm known as Goldenberg
International.
	   They have pleaded not guilty to the charges and are free on 6
million shillings (dlrs 100,000) bail each.
	   Last year, impatient with the government's failure to prosecute
the case and its reluctance to tackle graft in the top echelons of
the government, the International Monetary Fund cut off a dlrs 220
million loan to Kenya.
	   --
	   BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) _ A bus skidded off a hillside road and
fell into a ravine, killing fourteen people and injuring others,
Brazzaville University hospital officials said Tuesday.
	   The dead and injured were transported to the capital's central
hospital after the Monday afternoon accident at Etbouali, 200 kms
(120 miles) north of the capital, Brazzaville.
	   Survivors said speeding caused the accident.
	   More than 100 passengers were on the bus, mostly traders on
their way to a Tuesday market in the capital.

U.N.: Record investment in robots although market shrinks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 0001 GMT, Wednesday Oct. 14. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Robot sales are at record levels, but the machines
are far short of taking over the world, according to a United
Nations report released Wednesday.
	   While robots are marching ahead in electronics and machine
manufacturing, they haven't made expected inroads into the food
industry and farming, the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe said.
	   Some 85,000 robots were sold last year, up 6 percent from 1996,
said the commission's World Robotics 1998 report, published with
the International Federation of Robotics. The previous record of
81,000 was set in 1990.
	   The United States and western Europe fueled the surge, according
to the 300-page report.
	   But in Japan, the world's most automated country, sales slowed,
with many robots being installed as replacements. The worldwide
value of the market was put at dlrs 4.8 billion last year, down 4
percent from 1996.
	   With 277 robots for every 10,000 human workers last year, Japan
was far ahead of its nearest competitor, Germany, with 90. The
United States had 40.
	   ``The car industry is still the absolute dominant user of
industrial robots,'' according to Jan Karlsson, the commission's
head of statistics.
	   But they could well revolutionize domestic chores in the coming
10 to 15 years, he added. ``Quite soon, maids will be equipped with
robots.''
	   Robots which could help disabled people with everyday tasks such
as eating and drinking, cleaning teeth, picking up telephones or
even scratching an itch are another likely growth area, the report
added.
	   In the first half of this year, sales advanced in Europe but
declined in the United States and Asia, Karlsson said.
	   Around 40 percent more robots are likely to be sold in 2001 than
last year, the report said.
	   That is ``significantly lower'' than previous predictions,
``which is exclusively the result of significant revisions downward
of the forecast for Japan and other countries.''
	   However, the Asian financial crisis is unlikely to cause a huge
drop in demand for robots as they can substitute for workers,
Karlsson said.
	   The world had 711,500 robots last year, the report said.
Karlsson estimated one robot could take the place of two or more
people.
	   But they aren't always the ideal solution, and have yet to make
much headway in food processing, where labor costs are already low.
Like many electronic devices, they have problems working in the
sub-zero temperatures common in the industry.
	   The report noted a ``gap of understanding'' between the food
industry and robot engineers whose experience comes from cars and
electronics.

New Indonesian, Philippines presidents meet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BATAM, Indonesia (AP) _ After a delay caused by helicopter
problems, Philippine President Joseph Estrada arrived at this
primitive resort island by chartered ferry Tuesday night for an
unusual meeting with Indonesian President B.J. Habibie.
	   Officials said a mechanical fault was discovered in one of two
Indonesian helicopters that were to have flown Estrada and his
entourage through heavy rain from Singapore. Some members of the
party were in the chopper and the engine had started when the fault
was discovered, but officials could not confirm whether it was the
one intended to carry Estrada.
	   A ferry was chartered for the 45-minute sea journey.
	   Habibie apologized when Estrada finally arrived for the one-hour
private meeting, and dinner at the Melia Panorama Hotel.
	   Estrada replied, ``That's all right.''
	   The two men, neither of whom has been in power five months, then
dismissed their foreign ministers and other Cabinet officers while
they held a private talk, something unusual for heads of
government. The Cabinet members sat down for separate discussions
among themselves.
	   The meeting was scheduled on the sidelines of an East Asia
Economic Summit in Singapore, where Estrada had given the keynote
address Tuesday morning.
	   Estrada, swept into office with widespread support from the
poor, vowed in his June 30 inaugural speech to give the underclass
a fairer share of the country's wealth.
	   Habibie took office May 21, hours after his predecessor and
mentor, Suharto, was forced from power after national protests and
street riots over Indonesia's collapsing economy.
	   Both Habibie and Estrada consider themselves friends of Anwar
Ibrahim, who was deputy prime minister of Malaysia before his Sept.
2 firing by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Estrada and Habibie each expressed reservations about attending
the 18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Malaysia
next month after Anwar was arrested by a police commando unit that
broke into his home. Anwar then appeared in court with a black eye
and bruises he said were inflicted by police.
	   But it is unlikely the two new presidents will pass up the
chance to meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton and other leaders
at the APEC summit.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Cabinet hard-liners asked Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday to link a West Bank troop pullback to
Palestinian security guarantees, and an Israeli swimming in a
spring was shot dead in an attack blamed on Palestinian militants.
	   The shooting and the hard-liners' demands came a day before
Netanyahu was to leave for Washington for meetings with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton is pushing the two to conclude an
agreement on a long-overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   Palestinian militants have carried out a series of drive-by
shootings in recent years in hopes of wrecking peace talks.
	   In Tuesday's attack, assailant fired from a pistol at two
Israeli men bathing in a spring near the communal farm of Ora west
of Jerusalem, said police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby. One man was
killed and the second critically wounded, the spokesman said. The
assailants' car was later found abandoned near the West Bank.
	   In a special Cabinet meeting, ministers from the National
Religious Party demanded that Netanyahu not hand over any land to
the Palestinians unless they extradite suspects in attacks on
Israelis and cancel clauses in the PLO founding charter that call
for the destruction of Israel, said party spokesman Joshua
Mor-Yosef.
	   In addition, the NRP stipulated that Netanyahu not sign a
withdrawal agreement unless the scope of an additional pullback is
decided on now, Mor-Yosef said.
	   If Netanyahu wraps up a deal without meeting these conditions
the NRP will bring down the government, Mor-Yosef said. The party,
the patron of the Jewish settlement movement in the West Bank and
Gaza, has enough seats in the 120-member parliament to rob
Netanyahu of his parliamentary majority.
	   A government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Netanyahu will support the NRP's demands on security and the PLO
Charter, but will not agree to any formal Cabinet decision
restricting his power to negotiate.
	   Also Tuesday, several leading hawks in the ruling coalition
threatened to challenge Netanyahu in the next elections and field
their own candidate for prime minister if he agrees to a troop
withdrawal. Among those poised to challenge the prime minister are
two legislators from Netanyahu's Likud Party, Uzi Landau and Benny
Begin, son of the late Prime Minister Menachem Begin.
	   Outside the prime minister's office, several dozen Jewish
settlers, many from the divided West Bank town of Hebron, demanded
that Netanyahu make no more concessions to the Palestinians.
	   Noam Arnon, a spokesman for the 450 Jewish settlers in Hebron,
said that any land handed to the Palestinians is used as a base for
future attacks on Israelis. ``Every inch you give is an inch for
terror,'' Arnon said.
	   Netanyahu has agreed in principle to hand over 13 percent of the
West Bank, with some restrictions. The key issue to be tackled in
Washington is to work out an agreement on what constitutes a good
faith Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat many differences remained.
``There's a lot to be solved, if not here, then there (in
Washington),'' Arafat told reporters.
	   Arafat's spokesman, Nabil Abourdeneh, said the Washington summit
would be decisive. ``Either we reach a breakthrough or a dangerous
deadlock,'' he said. ``After that, no one can predict what will
happen in the area which is sitting atop a volcano.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton telephoned Netanyahu and Arafat on
Monday and urged them to make the necessary decisions to reach
agreement when they meet Thursday at Wye Plantation, Maryland.
	   Clinton said he would make every effort to conclude the
agreement on the troop withdrawal so that negotiations can begin on
the permanent settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The three members of
Bosnia-Herzegovina's joint national presidency were sworn in
Tuesday, promising to respect the 1995 agreement which ended the
Bosnian war.
	   The three _ representing the Muslim, Serb and Croat communities
_ were elected in the Sep. 12-13 nationwide balloting.
	   ``What we have just witnessed together ... is the birth of a new
chapter in the story of this young country,'' said Jacques Klein,
the American deputy to the Bosnia's top international mediator,
Carlos Westendorp.
	   The Bosnian Serb and Croat members, Zivko Radisic and Ante
Jelavic, are serving for the first time in the joint presidency.
The Muslim member, Alija Izetbegovic, was re-elected.
	   Radisic, who defeated the Serb hard-line candidate Momcilo
Krajisnik, will serve as chairman for the first eight months of the
four-year mandate.
	   Local and Western officials said believe Radisic's membership
will signal a new era of cooperation. Krajisnik was considered one
of the biggest obstacles to Serb cooperation in implementing the
1995 peace accords.
	   For the first time since the beginning of the war in 1992, the
inaugural ceremony took place in the main Bosnian government
building, which was heavily damaged during the war but
reconstructed recently.
	   Meetings of the previous joint presidency were held in
Sarajevo's National Museum at Krajisnik's insistence.

Lawyers contest refusal of bail to Malaysian dissident
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reform group comments, grafs 16-18 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers for arrested dissident
leader Anwar Ibrahim filed an appeal Tuesday challenging a court's
refusal of bail, as Malaysia told foreign nations not to interfere
with Anwar's forthcoming trial.
	   No date has been fixed for hearing the appeal. A High Court
judge had refused bail when Anwar, the former deputy prime
minister, was arraigned Oct. 5 on 10 counts of corruption and
illegal homosexual acts. Anwar pleaded innocent to all charges.
	   Meanwhile, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi denounced
what he called attempts by foreign nations to interfere in Anwar's
trial, which has been set for Nov. 2, newspapers said.
	   ``This is one example of interference we cannot accept,''
Abdullah said in comments to local reporters Monday evening.
	   He was referring to a report that a man claiming to be a U.S.
senator had made a phone call last week to Justice Augustine Paul,
the High Court judge conducting Anwar's trial, the newspaper New
Straits Times said.
	   The caller told the judge that justice must be seen to be done,
the daily said, and the judge reported the call to police.
	   Such a call is ``tantamount to interference as though we do not
understand the law and are unable to enforce the law well,''
Abdullah said.
	   No other details were available about the reported phone call.
	   Malaysia has repeated assurances that Anwar, who challenged
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year reign, will be given a
fair trial.
	   However, a group of British lawyers, representing Justice
International, a human rights group, said they will watch the trial
to check whether it is fair.
	   ``We feel that if there is to be a fair and open trial in the
case of Anwar, the presence of observers at the trial is
imperative,'' said Sayyad MohyEddeen, a London-based lawyer in the
group.
	   ``We have informed the chief justice and the attorney general of
our intention to participate at the forthcoming trial as
observers,'' he said.
	   Anwar, a former heir-apparent to Mahathir, was fired Sept. 2,
accused of being morally unfit to lead. The two had differed over
economic policy, and Anwar has said Mahathir feared the deputy was
a threat to his office.
	   Anwar was arrested on Sept. 20 and brought to a court nine days
later, badly bruised and with a black eye. He said police had
beaten him until he fell unconscious on his first night of
captivity.
	   His lawyers have repeatedly complained that they were being
harassed by police and even interrogated about their role as
defense attorneys. Until last week, lawyers were denied access to
Anwar, who is locked in a cell at Kuala Lumpur's police
headquarters.
	   Meanwhile, opposition groups stepped up protests Tuesday
denouncing the harsh Internal Security Act, following the arrest
Monday of a vocal, anti-government Muslim activist.
	   Mohamed Hatta Shaharom, vice president of the Malaysian Reform
Society, said the arrest of the group's president, Shaari Sungib,
had only resulted in ``firing up'' members' spirits and the group
would ``double their effort in reformation.''
	   The society is an active member in two newly formed
anti-government coalitions. Shaari was the 18th person seen as
aligned with Anwar to be arrested under the act, which allows jail
without trial. All but five, including Anwar, have been released.
	   The Coalition for People's Democracy, one of the two new
coalitions, urged Malaysians to wear white ribbons every day to
show their longing for justice.
	   ``It's small ribbon but it sends a powerful message,'' said the
chairman of the coalition, Tian Chua, about the three-inch
(7.6-centimeter) ribbon with an attached pin.
	   ``This shows that the people of Malaysia have not been
frightened by the culture of tyranny and oppression imposed by Dr.
Mahathir's government,'' he said, adding that the ribbons would be
handed out nationwide.

Philippines evacuates Filipinos from Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippines has begun evacuating
Filipino citizens and their dependents from Yugoslavia in
anticipation of NATO air strikes, the Philippine foreign office
said Tuesday.
	   Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said he has instructed
Philippine posts in Austria and Hungary to accept evacuees from
Yugoslavia as Friday's deadline for Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic over Kosovo nears.
	   The 16-nation alliance is urging Milosevic to end his crackdown
against ethnic Albanians and cooperate in efforts to restore
normalcy to the southern Serbian province.
	   Siazon said there are 20 Filipinos in Yugoslavia and they will
be brought to the Yugoslav-Hungarian border. They will be led out
by a Filipino refugee volunteer working in Kosovo.
	   He said the Filipinos will be flown back to the Philippines.
	   Most foreign missions in Belgrade have been scaling down their
embassy staff.

Three researchers in America win Nobel Physics Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with announcement of chemistry
prize. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three scientists working at
universities in the United States on Tuesday won the Nobel Physics
Prize for discovering that electrons on under certain circumstances
can form new kinds of particles.
	   Two other researchers at American institutions won the Nobel
Chemistry Prize, announced later in the day.
	   The physics prize went to Robert C. Laughlin of the United
States, Horst L. Stoermer of Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a
China-born American citizen. The chemistry prize was won by Walter
Kohn of the University of California-Santa Barbara and John Pople,
a British citizen teaching at Northwestern.
	   Like many of the Nobel science prizes, this year's physics award
is for work that is in the rarefied atmosphere of high theory but
that deals with fundamental questions.
	   ``The reason this is important is it has to do with big issues,
why the universe is the way it is,'' Laughlin, 47, of Stanford
University, told The AP by phone as he was having coffee with his
wife at home.
	   Stoermer (pronounced STER-mer), 49, currently is at Columbia
University in New York City and Tsui (TSOO-ee), 59, teaches at
Princeton University.
	   The prize-winning work was done together by Tsui and Stoermer
and elaborated by Laughlin.
	   The chemistry award is for work in the area of quantum
chemistry, for ``pioneering contributions in developing methods
that can be used for theoretical studies of the properties of
molecules and the chemical processes in which they are involved.''
	   According to the physics citation, the three laureates
discovered a new form of ``quantum fluid,'' which are fluids such
as liquid helium that have certain properties in common such as
superfluidity.
	   What makes these fluids important for researchers is that
``events in a drop of quantum fluid can afford more profound
insights into the general inner structure and dynamics of matter,''
the academy said.
	   It is ``yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics,'' the citation
said.
	   The chemistry and physics prizes each are worth 7.6 million
kronor (dlrs 978,000) and will be divided equally among their
respective winners.
	   Mats Jonson, a physics professor at Sweden's respected Chalmers
Institute of Technology, said the physics laureates' work could be
important in the development of smaller electronic components and
could lead to improving computer memories.
	   The prize-winning work was done in the early 1980s. Since then,
the development of sophisticated microelectonics has allowed other
researchers to confirm the work's validity, in experiments that the
Academy likened to ``measuring the sound of individual hailstones
during a hailstorm.''
	   Last year's physics laureates, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of France
and William Phillips and Steven Chu of the United States, were
honored for developing ways of trapping atoms of gas and cooling
them to within a millionth of a degree of absolute zero.
	   The work led to developing extraordinarily accurate atomic
clocks. Previous atomic clocks weren't exactly sloppy, being
accurate to about one second in 32 million years _ but the
improvements made possible a clock that loses just one second every
3 billion years.
	   The 1997 chemistry winners, American Paul D. Boyer, John E.
Walker of Britain and Jens C. Skou of Denmark, discovered aspects
of how the body's cells store and use energy, a fundamental process
that affects everything from the building of bones to the
transmission of nerve impulses.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   Their finding helped lead to the discovery of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra and could also pay off in new treatments for heart
disease, cancer and septic shock.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago. The economics prize winner is to be named
on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
	   All the prizes are announced in Stockholm, except for the peace
prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes
in his will.

Hyundai sends construction workers, equipment to North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The Hyundai business group sent 83
construction workers and equipment to North Korea Tuesday to build
port facilities for its proposed sightseeing tours.
	   A ship carrying the workers left South Korea's Donghae port for
Changjon, a port on North Korea's east coast. Eight barges loaded
with construction equipment followed.
	   The workers and 350 others to follow in the next month will
build berthing facilities at Changjon to be used by Hyundai ships
carrying tourists to nearby Diamond Mountain.
	   The workers also will build rest centers, restaurants and other
tourism-related facilities on and around the mountain, a major
tourist attraction.
	   Hyundai's founder and honorary chairman Chung Ju-yung visited
his native North Korea in June with a gift of 500 cattle and agreed
to start sightseeing tours of the mountain as a joint venture.
	   Hyundai, South Korea's largest conglomerate, hopes to send up to
2,000 tourists a week on two luxury cruise ships for tours of the
mountain, starting later this month.
	   Meanwhile, North Korea said in a letter to Hyundai Tuesday that
it would consider accepting a Seoul government proposal to launch a
joint investigation of the deaths of 71 cattle donated by Hyundai.
	   The North earlier accused the Seoul government of plotting to
kill the cattle by feeding them indigestible vinyl strips and lumps
of hemp rope before shipping them to the North.
	   South Korea rejected the accusation and suggested that
veterinarians and officials of North and South Korea jointly
investigate the deaths.

Portugal, South Africa hopeful of energy deal soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ South African Foreign Minister Alfred
Nzo said Tuesday he was hopeful of a breakthrough in lengthy
negotiations with Portugal and Mozambique on energy provisions to
his country.
	   Nzo said during an official visit to Portugal that in the next
few days he expected to receive technical recommendations on the
possible supply of electricity from the Portuguese-built Cahora
Bassa hydroelectric dam in Mozambique, which borders South Africa.
	   Nzo said he was ``very hopeful'' that the report would help
resolve the dispute over how much South Africa should pay for the
electricity.
	   ``What's still under discussion is the tariff question,'' Nzo
told a news conference. ``Our experts will give us their view on
what needs to be done,'' he added.
	   Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said officials were
discussing a new framework for energy provisions from the huge
Cahora Bassa scheme ``in the context of the great potential for
energy provision in southern Africa.''
	   The dam, which was built by the Portuguese before Mozambique
became independent in 1975, never became fully operational during
Mozambique's 15-year civil war.
	   A multinational effort to repair and refurbish the dam, located
on the Zambezi River in northern Mozambique, was completed last
year.
	   However, South Africa reportedly has balked at the price
demanded by Portugal for the electricity.
	   Officials declined to reveal the prices under discussion.

Lovelorn hen crows for mate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ As any farmer will tell you, hens don't
crow. But tell that to a Tehran resident whose chicken is making
headlines by breaking laws. Of nature that is.
	   The hen began her attempts at crowing soon after her mate was
slaughtered before her eyes by their owner, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
	   ``Right after the slaughter, the hen started making weird noises
and after several days of hard practice she successfully produced
the old tune of cock-a-doodle-doo,'' IRNA said quoting Tuesday's
Iran newspaper.
	   At first the owner thought a young rooster was learning to crow
but was stunned to see that it was the hen that had ``decided to
fill the absence of its partner by imitating him,'' IRNA said.
	   It did not identify the owner or give other details about his
coop.
	   The crowing story began when the rooster lost its timing and
started to crow at odd times instead of only in the mornings, which
annoyed the neighbors.
	   To placate them, the owner killed the rooster and treated his
household to ``a nice chicken dish,'' IRNA said.

Argentine president arrives in Paris for four-day visit

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Argentine President Carlos Menem arrived in Paris
Tuesday for a four-day visit aimed at boosting investment on the
strength of his country's economic turnaround.
	   Menem arrived mid-afternoon, accompanied by a 60-strong
delegation, including Foreign Minister Guido di Tella and Defense
Minister Jorge Dominguez.
	   In an interview published Tuesday by French daily Le Figaro,
Menem criticized European Union subsidies for farmers, saying such
practices run contrary to the spirit of the free market.
	   ``In Argentina, we feel that our partners don't practice what
they preach, and that's painful,'' Menem was quoted as saying in an
interview published Tuesday by French daily Le Figaro.
	   ``The market economy must be transparent and lucid,'' Menem
added. ``Argentina in no way protects its agricultural
production.''
	   Under Menem's leadership, Argentina's economy has been
transformed over the last decade. Free market policies slashed
hyperinflation and fueled unprecedented growth. The country is now
a bullish exporter of commodities.
	   Argentina is a member of the Cairns group _ a free trade lobby
organization pressing for an end to farm tariffs and non-tariff
barriers to agricultural trade throughout the world.
	   France is the third biggest foreign investor in Argentina, after
the United States and Spain, with interests in the car, water,
telecommunications, food and energy sectors. Between 1990 and 1996,
it invested dlrs 4.6 billion in Argentina.
	   But Menem, 68, said there were many more opportunities for
French and European businessmen. It was his fifth trip to France
since taking office for a first term in 1989.
	   ``We will tell the French _ and then the rest of the European
Union _ about our transformation, and invite people to invest,''
Menem said. ``Our country is credible and trustworthy, and its
institutions, economy and finances are solid.''
	   Menem will meet with French President Jacques Chirac on
Wednesday and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on Thursday.
	   After leaving France, he heads to Portugal for the Oct. 17-18
Ibero-American Summit.

Yugoslavia bows to regional pressure on Kosovo, but other disputes
</HEADLINE>
remain unsolved &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) _ Balkan leaders Tuesday expressed their
``deep satisfaction'' over a breakthrough in the Kosovo crisis, but
conceded they were a long way from solving many of their
intractable differences that could lead to regional conflict.
	   ``Our meeting showed that issues of security and solidarity can
be discussed regionally and a common decision can be taken,''
Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said at the end of the two-day
summit.
	   Prime ministers from Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, Romania and
Turkey attended the two-day meeting in this seaside resort, as did
the foreign minister of Albania and observers from Bosnia and
Croatia. They managed to convince Yugoslavia to allow a reference
to Kosovo in their final statement, a development some say would
have been impossible had U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke failed to
sway President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade.
	   ``We express our deep satisfaction of this new development and
of the understanding reached. We strongly support its full
implementation so as to bring lasting peace and stability in the
region,'' said the statement, which was also signed by Yugoslavia.
	   But although it mentioned their support for the ``granting of
large autonomy and self-government for Kosovo,'' and the leaders
agreed on a Balkan trade center in Ankara, the exuberance did not
last very long.
	   ``These paragraphs are a compromise. But in compromise we are
not being sincere and honest with ourselves. We have to speak
openly,'' Albanian Foreign Minister Pascal Milo angrily said at a
joint news conference. After making a case for NATO military
action, he added that ``I am not so happy to hear that we have
achieved compromise.''
	   Yugoslav Premier Momir Bulatovic was just as blunt, threatening
that NATO strikes would make the Dayton agreement null-and-void and
spread conflict beyond Kosovo's borders.
	   ``Events in Kosovo can bring grave consequences to the countries
in the region. It can only be solved through peaceful means,''
Bulatovic said. ``Bombs that would fall would interrupt any attempt
at peaceful resolutions. It would also be a violation of the Dayton
Accord, of which Yugoslavia is a signatory.''
	   Other regional problems managed to bubble through, including
Turkey and Greece's failure to find any common ground in their
longstanding Aegean Sea disputes, and their inability to talk about
next month's planned deployment by Greek Cypriots of Russian-made
S-300 missiles on the island. Their installation would lead to
probable war between the two NATO allies, which have so far almost
fought twice in the past 11 years.
	   Relations with Greece were further complicated by veiled
accusations it harbors Turkish Kurdish insurgents, which Simitis
denied, and Ankara's own threat to intervene in Syria because of
its own alleged harboring of such guerrillas. Greece and Syria have
a defense accord.
	   Simitis said Yilmaz told him about Turkey's intention to
``consider some kind of intervention'' if Damascus does not do
something soon. ``I told him we can't accept interventions without
international approval.''
	   But the leaders did agree on the necessity of such summits,
despite age-old disputes. Before the first summit on the Greek
island of Crete last year, many participating countries hadn't met
in decades.
	   Simitis, who organized Crete, conceded that it was better to sit
and talk rather than to brood and fight.
	   ``No one said we are living in paradise. Everything has its
dark, white and gray sides. But we will never solve problems if we
don't sit down and talk,'' he said.

Murdoch says Americans don't care about politicians; predicts
</HEADLINE>
Clinton won't resign &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Rupert Murdoch may be negotiating a
multimillion book and television deal to get Monica Lewinsky to
tell all about her relationship with President Bill Clinton _ but
the media magnate says Americans could care less about politicians.
	   ``As far as the American political scene goes, people are doing
so well they don't really want to know about politicians,'' Murdoch
said Tuesday after the annual general meeting of his
Australian-based News Corp.
	   Murdoch, who renounced the citizenship of his native Australia
to become a U.S. citizen, said he predicted a record low voter
turnout for congressional elections in November.
	   Asked if Clinton should resign or stand aside as a result of the
saga involving Lewinsky, Murdoch said: ``I never thought whether he
ought to or not. I'm sure he won't.''
	   News Corp. subsidiary Fox TV confirmed last week it was in
discussion with representatives of Lewinsky, but refused to confirm
details.
	   Trade newspaper Daily Variety reported that News Corp. had
offered Lewinsky a deal for a ``multimedia tell-all package,''
involving a television interview and a book that was worth dlrs 3
million.
	   The talks were reported on the day the U.S. House of
Representatives authorized an impeachment inquiry of Clinton. The
consequences of the inquiry range from a rebuke to removal from
office.
	   Murdoch also said he accepted increased media interest in his
own private life, saying: ``I think it goes with the territory.''
	   Murdoch has been subjected to Paparazzi-like scrutiny since he
reportedly began a relationship with Wendy Deng, a vice-president
of News Corp.'s Hong Kong-based Star TV satellite network.
	   Murdoch and Deng were recently photographed together on a yacht
owned by the billionaire on the Italian island of Sardinia.
	   The reports follow the collapse of his 30-year marriage to
novelist and philanthropist Anna Murdoch, who filed for divorce in
April citing irreconcilable differences.
	   News Corp. owns the Twentieth Century Fox studio, Fox network,
the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Post, the HarperCollins book
publisher and newspapers in Britain and Australia.

German metalworkers union leader wants 6.5 percent pay raises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The head of IG Metall metalworkers
union on Tuesday said he would push for a 6.5-percent pay raise for
Germany's 3.4 million metalworkers when talks for new 1999
contracts begin later this year.
	   The demand follows two consecutive years of settling for pay
increases of 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, about even with the rate
of inflation.
	   A union spokeswoman said the IG Metall pay commission would hold
its first meeting the end of October, and that a first round of
talks with employers had not yet been scheduled.
	   The wage talks will be closely watched as they will be the first
under Germany's new center-left government, following the
center-right's push to keep down labor costs.

IMF says success of Malaysia's currency controls depends on further
</HEADLINE>
reforms &QL; 
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The director of the International Monetary
Fund's Asia-Pacific operations stressed Tuesday that Malaysia needs
additional reforms if its unorthodox move into currency controls is
to work.
	   ``Whether their present policy course, which is different from
the other countries, will succeed, you have to wait and see,''
Hubert Neiss told reporters on the sidelines of the World Economic
Forum's seventh annual East Asia Economic Summit.
	   ``But a lot depends on what other policies are carried out,''
said Neiss, noting that Malaysia's banking system is in need of
repair, and many corporations also require restructuring.
	   Malaysia imposed strict controls Sept. 1, pegging the currency
to the U.S. dollar, banning the trade of Malaysian companies'
shares in foreign markets, and restricting the flow of domestic and
foreign capital into and out of the country.
	   The surprise measures, which took immediate pressure off the
beleaguered local currency and stock markets, is anathema to IMF
and Western economic free-market orthodoxy.
	   Some of Malaysia's closest neighbors have described the moves as
a step backward for free trade in the region, and other critics
have cautioned that it could lead Malaysia into a false sense of
security.
	   Malaysian officials attending the economic conference in
Singapore this week have described the changes as minor, and said
they would affect less than 5 percent of foreign investors,
specifically speculators who are interested in short-term profit,
not long-term investment.
	   The Malaysians say that the forced return of the currency, the
ringgit, has helped the economy, spurring housing construction and
car purchases.
	   They have described the controls as providing breathing space to
insulate the economy from the effects of foreign speculation.
	   It was not the first time a country has resorted to market
controls for quick relief from a falling currency and stock market.
	   ``What Malaysia did was not unique. Other countries have imposed
controls, and usually there have been some problems,'' Neiss said.
	   ``After a while, it didn't work out ... because controls
themselves created new distortions, and controls were
circumvented,'' he warned.
	   He said that although Malaysia entered the regional crisis in a
somewhat better state than other Asian countries, its problems were
essentially the same, and required many of the same painful
reforms.
	   However, he said that if things go well for Malaysia, other
countries may try to follow suit.

Right-to-die advocates press for death with dignity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARE NULLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Faced with an almost blanket
international ban on euthanasia, advocates of assisted suicide are
trying to promote their demands that terminally ill people be
allowed to ``die with dignity.''
	   Delegates at the biennial conference of the World Federation of
Right to Die Societies say they expect no quick legal or medical
solutions because of opposition from most church groups and
political leaders.
	   But they maintain that it is outdated and unjustifiable to
insist that patients in dire pain and with no hope of a cure should
carry on living.
	   ``If you want to have a good death at the end of a good life,
that choice should be open to you,'' said Jean Davies Wright, from
Britain's euthanasia society, at a press conference Tuesday.
	   ``People are prevented from dying from causes like they would
have done a generation ago. They are dying slowly and they don't
like it,'' she said.
	   ``Dogs wouldn't be allowed to suffer like this.''
	   European pro-euthanasia groups plan to lobby the European
Parliament for a resolution that the ``right to choose a dignified
death should be a basic human right,'' Davies Wright said.
	   Within Europe, the Netherlands has the most relaxed legal
approach.
	   Voluntary euthanasia _ whereby the physician administers a
lethal injection to a patient _ and assisted suicide _ where the
patient takes drugs prescribed by the doctor _ are technically
illegal.
	   But as long as doctors follow established guidelines, they
escape prosecution.
	   According to Dutch government figures, some 3,200 deaths were
due to euthanasia in 1995 _ out of a total of 138,000 from all
causes. This was the same level as five years previously.
	   In Switzerland, it is illegal for doctors to administer fatal
injections. But doctors and _ uniquely _ lay persons can assist
suicide and there have been no cases of prosecution.
	   The Swiss right to die society _ or Exit _ helps about 120
terminally ill people each year to die. The majority of them are
cancer sufferers.
	   The applicant has to be at least 18, mentally competent and
suffering from intolerable health problems. According to the Exit
manual, an Exit counselor visits the applicant on the appointed
date, accompanied by a close relative. Patients are given a
barbiturate dissolved in water which they drink themselves.
	   In most other European countries the legal waters are muddier.
	   Two doctors in the United Kingdom and Norway go on trial this
week for helping in the death of terminally ill patients.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Three scientists working at
universities in the United States on Tuesday won the Nobel Physics
Prize for discovering that electrons on under certain circumstances
can form new kinds of particles.
	   Two other researchers at American institutions won the Nobel
Chemistry Prize, announced later in the day.
	   The physics prize went to Robert C. Laughlin of the United
States, Horst L. Stoermer of Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a
China-born American citizen. The chemistry prize was won by Walter
Kohn of the University of California-Santa Barbara and John Pople,
a British citizen teaching at Northwestern.
	   Like many of the Nobel science prizes, this year's physics award
is for work that is in the rarefied atmosphere of high theory but
that deals with fundamental questions.
	   ``The reason this is important is it has to do with big issues,
why the universe is the way it is,'' Laughlin, 47, of Stanford
University, told The AP by phone as he was having coffee with his
wife at home.
	   Stoermer (pronounced STER-mer), 49, currently is at Columbia
University in New York City and Tsui (TSOO-ee), 59, teaches at
Princeton University.
	   The prize-winning work was done together by Tsui and Stoermer
and elaborated by Laughlin.
	   The chemistry award is for work in the area of quantum
chemistry, for ``pioneering contributions in developing methods
that can be used for theoretical studies of the properties of
molecules and the chemical processes in which they are involved.''
	   Quantum chemistry allows researchers to study substances that
are difficult to produce in the laboratory and thus has a wide
range of applications such as studying interstellar matter and how
pollutants such as freon react with the ozone layer.
	   According to the physics citation, the three laureates
discovered a new form of ``quantum fluid,'' which are fluids such
as liquid helium that have certain properties in common such as
superfluidity.
	   What makes these fluids important for researchers is that
``events in a drop of quantum fluid can afford more profound
insights into the general inner structure and dynamics of matter,''
the academy said.
	   It is ``yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics,'' the citation
said.
	   The chemistry and physics prizes each are worth 7.6 million
kronor (dlrs 978,000) and will be divided equally among their
respective winners.
	   Mats Jonson, a physics professor at Sweden's respected Chalmers
Institute of Technology, said the physics laureates' work could be
important in the development of smaller electronic components and
could lead to improving computer memories.
	   The prize-winning work was done in the early 1980s. Since then,
the development of sophisticated microelectonics has allowed other
researchers to confirm the work's validity, in experiments that the
Academy likened to ``measuring the sound of individual hailstones
during a hailstorm.''
	   Last year's physics laureates, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of France
and William Phillips and Steven Chu of the United States, were
honored for developing ways of trapping atoms of gas and cooling
them to within a millionth of a degree of absolute zero.
	   The work led to developing extraordinarily accurate atomic
clocks. Previous atomic clocks weren't exactly sloppy, being
accurate to about one second in 32 million years _ but the
improvements made possible a clock that loses just one second every
3 billion years.
	   The 1997 chemistry winners, American Paul D. Boyer, John E.
Walker of Britain and Jens C. Skou of Denmark, discovered aspects
of how the body's cells store and use energy, a fundamental process
that affects everything from the building of bones to the
transmission of nerve impulses.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   Their finding helped lead to the discovery of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra and could also pay off in new treatments for heart
disease, cancer and septic shock.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago. The economics prize winner is to be named
on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
	   All the prizes are announced in Stockholm, except for the peace
prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes
in his will.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The president of Russia's breakaway
Chechnya region arrived on a five-day visit Tuesday to participate
in an international human rights conference.
	   During his stay, President Aslan Maskhadov will be protected by
a body guard assigned by the Foreign Ministry. However, he will not
meet with any of Poland's government leaders.
	   ``We did not seek such meetings to avoid provoking tension in
Poland's relations with Russia,'' said Mariusz Kaminski, a
Solidarity parliament member who helped organize the visit.
	   Maskhadov will meet with some prominent politicians, including
the leader of the Solidarity bloc, Marian Krzaklewski, and the
leader of the extreme right party, Movement for Poland's Renewal,
Jan Olszewski.
	   He will be accompanied by the Chechen Foreign Minister Movladi
Ugudov.
	   Maskhadov won a landslide election victory in January 1997, but
during his time in office, Chechnya has seen a steep rise in
kidnappings and other crimes.
	   No country has recognized Chechnya's claims of independence, and
Russia still considers it a semi-autonomous Russian republic.
	   The conference, which starts on Wednesday, was organized by the
upper house of parliament. Other prominent guests expected are the
expelled Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng and former Soviet
dissident Sergei Kovalyov.

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Authorities on Tuesday identified a badly
decomposed body found on the eastern Aegean island of Samos as that
of a Dutch tourist who was reported missing a year ago, media
reported.
	   A hunter discovered the body, identified as that of Johannes
Franciscus Klein, 55, in a mountainous area of the island, media
said. Klein had been reported missing while on holiday on Sept. 11,
1997.
	   Police could not immediately confirm the report.
	   According to media reports, police believe Klein died when he
accidentally slipped on loose rocks.
	   Klein's body was taken to a Samos hospital for an autopsy, media
said.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
proclaimed a breakthrough in efforts to end the Kosovo crisis after
weeklong talks with President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   But, he warned, ``we're not out of the emergency yet.'' He said
it's up to Milosevic's government to prove its commitment to
international demands it has agreed to honor.
	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw his forces from Kosovo,
begin peace negotiations with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow
some 2,000 international observers into the troubled Kosovo
province.
	   In a rare national television address, the Yugoslav leader
declared that the agreements ``avert the danger of a military
intervention against our country.''
	   ``Our task is to accelerate the political process and economic
recovery of our country as a whole,'' Milosevic said. It was the
first time the Yugoslav president had addressed the nation since
the 1995 Dayton peace accords which ended the war in neighboring
Bosnia.
	   Tuesday's developments capped a dramatic series of developments
to force an end to Milosevic's crackdown against ethnic Albanian
rebels in the southern province in Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   Before his television address, Milosevic said the agreement
demonstrated his government's commitment to the peace process, but
also reflected his position that the demands are unwarranted.
	   ``The steps which our country is taking to solve the Kosovo
problems by peaceful means show our firm commitment that all
questions can be solved by political means, but also the
determination to protect the country's territorial integrity and
sovereignty,'' he said in a statement.
	   Since the crackdown began Feb. 28, Milosevic has insisted the
crisis was an internal matter in which foreign powers should play
no role. The crackdown was aimed at crushing the Kosovo Liberation
Army, fighting for independence of the majority Albanian province,
which is a part of the Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed in Kosovo and hundreds of
thousands of people have been forced from their homes during the
seven-month operation.
	   International leaders stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis
because of fears that thousands of homeless refugees would die if
they could not return to their homes by the time winter sets in.
	   Yugoslavia expects that the verification mission, to be led by
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, ``will
eliminate false, untrue and malicious reports about the situation
in Kosovo,'' Milosevic said in his statement.
	   To make sure Milosevic abides by the agreement, NATO agreed
early Tuesday on the final step needed to authorize airstrikes. The
16-nation alliance set a four-day deadline for Milosevic to begin
complying with international demands.
	   In the Kosovo capital Pristina, an ethnic Albanian politician
who claims to speak for the KLA. said he was pleased by the NATO
action but expressed skepticism that Milosevic would live up to the
agreement.
	   The politician, Adem Demaci, said he was disappointed that the
verification force would be unarmed.
	   In neighboring Albania, Foreign Ministry spokesman Sokol Gjoka
said he hoped Milosevic ``will not play with his promises, like he
has done in the past.'' Kosovo rebels maintain sanctuaries in
northern Albania.
	   Ethnic Albanian rebels have insisted on independence rather than
regaining the autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989, and some
militants want to establish a ``Greater Albania'' encompassing all
Albanian-speaking communities in the southern Balkans. But
international leaders oppose Kosovo independence, fearing that
could lead to further instability in the tense Balkans.
	   After late night meetings in Brussels, Holbrooke returned
Tuesday to Belgrade and reached the agreement with Milosevic.
	   ``We hope this will mark a turning point in the right direction.
But the proof ... is in compliance with U.N. resolution 1199 and
with actions on the ground in Kosovo,'' the U.S. trouble-shooter
said.
	   Soon after NATO formally moved to the verge of airstrikes, U.S.
President Bill Clinton announced key concessions by Milosevic. NATO
took its decision after Holbrooke flew to alliance headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium, to brief ambassadors on his talks with
Milosevic.
	   Holbrooke, who noted that the deal will not affect existing
sanctions against Yugoslavia, said the key to the accord was
Milosevic's decision to allow a 2,000-member ``verification
mission'' and to permit ``aerial verification'' by non-combat
aircraft that could begin as soon as the end of the week.
	   In addition, political negotiations with the ethnic Albanians
will continue in Kosovo, led by Christopher Hill, the U.S.
ambassador to Macedonia.
	   In Brussels, NATO sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Milosevic must take four steps: immediately withdraw special
troops from Kosovo, sign an agreement with the OSCE on the
verification mission, sign an agreement with NATO on the airborne
reconnaissance and hammer out a ``framework agreement'' by November
outlining future talks with ethnic Albanians.
	   The agreements with OSCE and NATO are expected to be signed
within days, the sources said.

Latest crisis sending more children onto streets in Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ More of Russia's children are living on the
streets or in orphanages because of the country's financial
troubles, and they are committing suicide in greater numbers, the
head of the U.N. Children's Fund said Tuesday.
	   UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy told reporters that
children's welfare had already worsened during the transition to a
market economy, when ``the focus has been largely on economic and
political reform with a significant deterioration in education and
health.''
	   According to UNICEF research, since the 1991 collapse of the
Soviet Union, more Russian children are living on the streets,
killing themselves, abusing drugs and contracting AIDS. Education
is underfunded and children are dropping out of school in greater
numbers.
	   The situation is only worsening amid Russia's latest financial
crisis, as families slip further into poverty and the government
has even less money to pay teachers and doctors.
	   Though children in Russia are still better off than in many
countries, a drop in state support for them is ``a very
fast-growing problem,'' Bellamy said.
	   Russia's ``indicators are not nearly as bad as many of the
countries in which we are working. But it's the trend of the
indicators that are the most troubling,'' she said.
	   The number of children in infant homes in Russia, for example,
has gone up by a third from 1989 through 1996, UNICEF figures say.
Over the same period, prosecution of minors has almost doubled, as
has the suicide rate for males age 5 to 19. The number of children
enrolling in kindergartens is down by 10 percent.
	   Though official figures are not available for the last year and
a half, Bellamy said these trends are likely continuing.
	   To combat the slide, Bellamy said UNICEF is developing programs
that target youth most at risk, and is trying to raise more money.
UNICEF's programs in Russia started two years ago, and only about
dlrs 1 million is allocated to Russia annually.
	   Despite the worsening conditions for children, Bellamy praised
the Russian government for early ratification of the U.N.
Convention on the Rights of the Child, which commits it to ensuring
that all children under 18 get health care, education and
psychological and social support.
	   But with the government considering drastic cost-cutting
measures, UNICEF is pushing Russia not to forget education and
health as it drafts its economic program.
	   ``Even in the most difficult of economic times the burden can't
just fall on the social development and social protection side of
the budget,'' Bellamy said. ``This is an issue that has to be
raised over and over and over again.''

Village pubs may double as doctor's offices, job centers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A pint of ale and a checkup, please.
	   That could be the order in Britain's village pubs under a
government proposal to locate doctors' offices and services in
unused rooms at local watering holes, The Daily Telegraph reported
Tuesday.
	   As the focal point for many rural communities, pubs would be
ideal sites for such services as doctors' offices, job centers and
post offices, according to a Rural Development Commission plan
aimed at revitalizing rural life. People in many small towns now
have to travel miles for such services.
	   The commission is seeking government grants for village pubs so
they can open unused rooms and outbuildings for the good of the
community.
	   ``Most pubs have a spare room or adjoining building which they
could easily convert ... while the pub function room can double up
as a meeting place where there is no village hall,'' Mary Owen, the
commission's rural development officer, told the newspaper.
	   Nearly half the 9,000 rural communities examined _ all with
populations less than 10,000 _ have no post office, and 80 percent
have no doctor's office, the Telegraph said. Almost none have job
or benefit centers.

Ukraine's negative foreign trade balance reaches dlrs 1.47 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's negative foreign trade balance
reached dlrs 1.47 billion over the first eight months of this year,
the State Statistics Committee said Tuesday.
	   Ukrainian exports totaled dlrs 8.178 billion in January-August
1998, while imports amounted to dlrs 9.650 billion, it said.
	   Despite the economic crisis in Russia, Moscow remained Ukraine's
largest trade partner, accounting for 24.8 percent of its exports
and 48.4 percent of imports.
	   Ukraine exported 6.2 percent of its produce to China, another
5.8 percent to Turkey and 5 percent to Germany. Germany accounted
for 8.5 percent of the imports, followed by the United States with
4.3 percent, and Poland with 3.4 percent, the committee said.
	   It noted that 7.9 percent of export deals and 6.5 percent of
import deals so far in 1998 were in the form of barter arrangements
that involve exchanges of goods and services without actual
payments.

Steady policy dominates in Europe's banking talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Buffeted by conflicting calls on how
to shore up the continent's flagging growth, Europe's central
bankers gathered Tuesday to discuss how to merge financial
policies.
	   In spite of pressures building from global financial turmoil,
central bankers are determined to ensure a stable launch for the
common currency on Jan. 1, and are not expected to make any sudden
moves, such as cutting rates.
	   The central bankers from 11 European nations adopting the single
currency, or euro, must set a single European interest rate before
the launch, which will bring down rates in most countries in any
case.
	   But the bankers don't want to react hastily to the global crisis
or the decision last week by U.S. officials to cut the rate there,
and will likely keep Europe's unified interest rate the same as
Germany's core rate of 3.3 percent.
	   ``I haven't yet seen any evidence that any of the bankers are
panicking,'' said Stefan Bergheim, economist at U.S. investment
bank Merrill Lynch in Frankfurt.
	   ``Europe's central bankers have been accused of being too naive
about the international situation, but I don't think that's so. For
now, it's `steady hand-politics','' said Bergheim.
	   Speculation about a possible cut has grown since the United
States cut its rate last week. Germany's incoming finance minister,
Oskar Lafontaine, for one, wants rates cut to stimulate growth.
	   Economists and Germany's central banker, Hans Tietmeyer,
disagree. Speaking Monday, Tietmeyer called for Germany's key rate,
a low 3.3 percent, to stay steady.
	   About half of the countries launching the euro already have
rates higher than Germany's, meaning those rates will almost
certainly have to come down to match.
	   Potentially more serious than the interest rate dispute are
concerns that Germany's Social Democrats, who will form a
government at the end of October, will try to exert political
influence on the new bank, which is modeled closely on Germany's
own Bundesbank.
	   Lafontaine has made clear his desire for a political
counterweight to the European Central Bank.
	   For now, analysts think the bank will resist any pressures.
	   Greater political influence could begin next July, when the term
of Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer expires and the Social
Democratic-led government will choose a replacement.
	   Tietmeyer sits on the European Central Bank's governing council,
and his deputy, Otmar Issing, is a member of the bank's six-member
executive board.

Russian weapons exporter claims rise of revenues in 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's state arms exporter will make dlrs 1.2
billion more in sales this year than in 1997, the company's
director said Tuesday.
	   Rosvooruzheniye chief Yevgeny Ananyev also said the 1998
revenues will be dlrs 1.7 billion more than in 1996, the Interfax
news agency reported. He refused to provide the total figure.
	   Although well down from Soviet levels, Russia is one of the
world's top four arms exporters, supplying relatively inexpensive
weapons with a reputation for reliability.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO said Tuesday its threat of
airstrikes against Serbia remained in place despite the
breakthrough in peace talks between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Officials at NATO headquarters said the threat to launch strikes
as early as this weekend would remain in place to keep the pressure
on Milosevic as finishing touches were made to a deal to defuse the
Kosovo crisis.
	   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
threat could be lifted or the deadline extended at anytime.
	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw his forces from Kosovo,
begin peace negotiations with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow
some 2,000 international observers into the troubled Serb province.
	   Holbrooke proclaimed a breakthrough in efforts to end the Kosovo
crisis, but warned ``we're not out of the emergency yet.'' He said
it's up to Milosevic's government to prove its commitment to
honoring international demands.
	   Officials at NATO headquarters said Milosevic must take four
steps:
	   _ immediately withdraw special troops from Kosovo.
	   _ sign an agreement with the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe which will send international observers to
Kosovo.
	   _ sign an agreement to allow NATO planes to overfly Kosovo for
reconnaissance and back up the OSCE mission.
	   _ hammer out a ``framework agreement'' by early November
outlining future talks with the Kosovo Albanians.
	   The agreements with the OSCE and NATO are expected to be signed
within days, the sources said.
	   NATO's 16 member nations completed their airstrike plan against
Yugoslavia in the early hours of Tuesday morning by approving an
``activation order'' that formally placed hundreds of allied
warplanes under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander Wesley
K. Clark.
	   The order was the last military step NATO had to take before
actual airstrikes, but NATO gave Milosevic a breathing space of
four days to agree a deal on Kosovo.
	   In New York, U.S. President Bill Clinton warned that any
backtracking would still bring swift NATO air strikes.
	   ``Commitments are not compliance,'' Clinton said in a statement
he read Monday night after a campaign fund-raising event. ``Balkan
graveyards are filled with President Milosevic's broken promises.''
	   Clinton said Milosevic had agreed to allow a ``robust'' team of
international inspectors _ monitoring both by land and air _ to see
that Serb troops pull back, that refugees be allowed to return to
their homes, and that other conditions of the U.N. Security Council
be met.
	   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said the monitoring
force would number about 2,000.
	   NATO later Tuesday briefed Russian envoys on the deal. Russia
has strongly opposed NATO airstrikes, but backs the idea of OSCE
monitors.
	   In contrast with recent tension, a NATO official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the latest meeting with the Russians
was ``constructive and harmonious.''

Russia to reply to Japan's territorial proposals

 &UR; Eds: ADDS Russia thanking Japan for humanitarian aid in new final 3
grafs. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will respond to Japan's proposals on the
disputed Kuril Islands when Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
visits Moscow next month, a news agency said Tuesday.
	   The dispute over four islands in the Kuril chain, seized by the
Soviet Union at the end of World War II, has prevented the two
countries from signing a peace treaty.
	   Former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto made new
proposals for ending the dispute when he and Yeltsin met in Japan
in April.
	   They have not been made public. Japanese media say Tokyo
proposes taking over the islands legally, but allowing Russian to
retain control for some time.
	   Foreign Ministry official Alexander Losyukov said Russia will
respond during Obuchi's visit in November.
	   ``We have an understanding how this should be done,'' he said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``Work is now in progress
on wording.''
	   Meanwhile, Russia thanked Japan on Tuesday for 5 million yen
(dlrs 42,000) in humanitarian aid presented Saturday to a town that
was wiped out by forest fires on the eastern island of Sakhalin,
just west of the Kuril chain, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The aid was to be delivered sometime this week to some 700
residents of the Gorky township, which burned down completely in
the fire last month.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin called the gift a
``noble act'' that displayed ``the friendly relations between
Russia and Japan, which are market by mutual readiness to stretch
out a helping hand to the neighbor in a difficult situation,''
Interfax reported.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Five researchers at universities in the
United States won the Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry on
Tuesday for work exploring the quantum realm of matter.
	   Three physicists will share the prize for discovering how
electrons can change their behavior, work that could lead to
further advances in microelectronics.
	   And two researchers were named co-winners of the chemistry prize
for theoretical research into the quantum properties of molecules.
	   Each prize carries a 978,000 award, which the winners will
divide.
	   The chemisty award went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California-Santa Barbara and John Pople of Northwestern University.
Kohn, 75, was born in Vienna, Austria, and has taught at U.S.
institutions since 1950. Pople, 72, is a British citizen.
	   Kohn was cited for development of density-functional theory and
Pople for his development of computational methods in quantum
chemistry.
	   The laureates in physics are Robert B. Laughlin of the United
States, Horst L. Stoermer of Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a native
of China who is now a U.S. citizen.
	   They discovered that ordinary electrons acting together in
strong magnetic fields and very low temperatures can condense into
new types of composite subatomic particles that function as a
fluid, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. Subsequently,
other researchers confirmed their experiments and directly observed
these new composites, known as quasiparticles.
	   Laughlin works at Stanford University, Stoermer (pronounced
STER-mer) currently is at Columbia University and Tsui (TSOO-ee)
teaches at Princeton University. The award recognizes work Tsui and
Stoermer did together in 1982. Laughlin elaborated on the work the
next year.
	   Laughlin, 47, who did his graduate studies at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, got the news in the middle of the night.
	   ``The reason why this is important is that it has to do with why
the universe is the way it is,'' he said today. ``You can chop (the
universe) to pieces or learn how all the pieces work together. This
is a triumph of the second.''
	   According to the citation, the three men discovered a new form
of ``quantum fluid'' _ fluids such as liquid helium that have
certain properties in common, such as superfluidity.
	   What makes these fluids important for researchers is that they
can reveal more about the inner structure and dynamics of matter.
	   It is ``yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics,'' the academy
said.
	   Mansour Shayegan, a colleague of Tsui at Princeton, said all
three ``have done wonderful work.''
	   ``They have essentially discovered a new state of condensed
matter,'' he said.
	   Mats Jonson, a physics professor at Sweden's respected Chalmers
Institute of Technology, said the laureates' work could be
important in the development of smaller electronic components and
could lead to improving computer memories by manipulating electrons
in this altered state.
	   The development of microelectronics has allowed other
researchers to confirm the work's validity in experiments the
academy likened to ``measuring the sound of individual hailstones
during a hailstorm.''
	   The trio's work built on experiments performed by German
physicist Klaus von Kiltzing, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in
1985.
	   Tsui, 59, was born in Henan, China, in 1939. He came to the
United States in 1958 to attend Augustana College in Rock Island,
Illinois. He received his doctorate in physics from the University
of Chicago and was appointed a professor at Princeton in 1982.
	   Stoermer received his doctorate in physics from Stuttgart
University. He joined Columbia this year after supervising the
Physical Research Laboratory at Bell Laboratories since 1992.
	   Last year's physics laureates, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of France
and William Phillips and Steven Chu of the United States, were
honored for developing ways of trapping atoms of gas and cooling
them to within a millionth of a degree of absolute zero. The work
led to developing extraordinarily accurate atomic clocks.
	   The 1997 chemistry winners, American Paul D. Boyer, John E.
Walker of Britain and Jens C. Skou of Denmark, discovered aspects
of how the body's cells store and use energy, a fundamental process
that affects everything from the building of bones to the
transmission of nerve impulses.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for discovering
properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but also a
life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   Their finding helped lead to the discovery of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra.
	   The literature prize was awarded Thursday to Portuguese novelist
Jose Saramago. The economics prize winner is to be named on
Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
	   All the prizes are announced in Stockholm, except for the peace
prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes
in his will.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Police on Tuesday arrested six former officials of
Mita Industrial Co. on charges of paying dividends illegally to
shareholders to hide its financial difficulties.
	   Mita Industrial, which made copy machines, went into bankruptcy
in August with debts of more than 200 billion yen (dlrs 1.7
billion). It is now being restructured under Japan's corporate
rehabilitation law.
	   A police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
those arrested included former president Yoshihiro Mita, 59, and
Kunihiro Murai, 58, a certified public accountant and the company
auditor.
	   Earlier Tuesday, police raided Mita Industrial offices.
	   The official said Mita Industrial made no profit in 1997, but
paid dividends totaling 250 million yen (dlrs 2.1 million) to 18
shareholders, including Yoshihiro Mita, in February and April this
year.
	   Police and prosecutors will question the six on whether there
were similar window-dressing payments in past years.
	   The payment of dividends when a company makes no profit violates
Japan's commercial code, and is punishable by up to five years in
prison or a fine of 5 million yen (dlrs 42,000), the official said.
	   Police began investigation after bankruptcy administrator Makoto
Miyazaki discovered the dividend payments and took legal action
against former president Mita, the official said.
	   He declined to discuss details, but Kyodo News service reported
that Mita Industrial had paid dividends totaling 1.13 billion yen
(dlrs 9.5 million) to shareholders in the five years ended November
1997.
	   Mita's earnings have been sharply hurt by the weakening yen in
recent years. The company piled up debt as it failed to trim its
work force of 3,600 despite falling sales.
	   Mita Industrial, an unlisted company founded in 1948, had sales
of 100 billion yen (dlrs 840 million) in the year ended November
1997.

Swede says no instructions to talks with Wings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Detroit's Swedish defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom
says, contrary to what was reported, he has not told his agent to
begin negotiations with the Red Wings.
	   ``I haven't told him to start negotiations,'' Lidstrom was
quoted as saying in Tuesday's Detroit Free Press.
	   Booth Newspapers, quoting a source close to Lidstrom, reported
Monday that Lidstrom met with his agent Don Meehan over the weekend
in Toronto to begin negotiations on a new contract.
	   Lidstrom said while he did meet with Meehan and plans to talk
with him again this week, he didn't tell him to begin talks with
the Wings.
	   ``I haven't told him to do that,'' Lidstrom said. ``I haven't
made up my mind _ that's where things are at.''
	   A message was left today with Meehan's office in Mississauga,
Ontario, seeking comment.
	   Lidstrom has said he might play out his option this year and
return to Sweden so he could raise his children in his homeland.
	   Lidstrom was a finalist last season for the Norris Trophy, given
each year to the North American National Hockey League's best
defenseman, and was voted to the league's All-Star first team. He
had 17 goals and 59 points last season.

Australian drug suspect who fled Thailand now on Interpol list
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An Australian woman who fled Thailand
after jumping bail on drug smuggling charges has been listed on
Interpol's ``most wanted list,'' Thai police said Tuesday.
	   An Interpol bulletin lists Lisa Marie Smith, 22, as wanted by
Thai police for ``illegal possession of narcotics and smuggling,''
said an officer from Thailand's Interpol unit, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   A Thai judge issued an arrest warrant for Smith in August 1996
after she failed to appear in court to face drug-trafficking
charges.
	   She had been arrested in February that year at Bangkok
International Airport with more than 560 amphetamine tablets and 4
kilograms (8.8 pounds) of hashish.
	   Smith, the daughter of Hong Kong-based financial executive Terry
Smith, was released from detention on June 14, 1996, after her
father posted 1.5 million baht bail (worth about dlrs 60,000 at the
time).
	   Born in Melbourne, Australia, Smith held both Australian and
British passports, which is believed to have facilitated her
escape.
	   Her listing in the bulletin obligates the 170 Interpol member
countries to help Thailand look for Smith and forward relevant
information about her to Thai authorities. The listing includes a
hazy 2-year-old photo of her along with a brief description, said
the Thai Interpol officer.
	   Smith had claimed through her lawyers that she was duped by a
Pakistani man who had befriended her into carrying the drugs in a
travel bag that she was to pass to a friend of his in Japan.
	   She said the man had paid for her air ticket to Tokyo, and
provided dlrs 900 for expenses.
	   Smith could face a 15-year prison sentence if found guilty on
the drug charges.

Woman miscarries after working long hours as election observer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A 27-year-old lawyer accused authorities
Tuesday of causing her to suffer a miscarriage after ignoring a
medical appeal to excuse her from duty as an election observer.
	   Local authorities allegedly did not accept a doctor's note
certifying that Irene Kalatzaki should be relieved from judicial
observer duty in Sunday's municipal elections. She was four months
pregnant and experiencing health problems.
	   Judicial observers for elections are picked at random from
qualified lawyers in the bar association. The temporary posting,
although paid, is compulsory.
	   Ms. Kalatzaki said other women working as observers in the
election center in the northeastern Greek region of Rodopi objected
to her being excused and threatened to walk out unless she stayed.
	   The woman said she remained at the election center until
midnight and felt ill after returning home. She had a miscarriage
early Monday.
	   ``I feel very bitter and hurt,'' she said in a television
interview.
	   She did not immediately say whether she planned legal action.

Sri Lankan army arrests deserters in civil war
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ After huge losses in the battlefield
last month, teams of military intelligence, police and local
officials fanned out across Sri Lanka and arrested 1,206 deserters,
a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   The military appeared eager to bolster its strength for what it
sees as a crucial stage in the 15-year-old war against Tamil
rebels. Desertions from the 100,000-strong army are estimated at
25,000. Some deserted their units as long as 25 years ago.
	   Military officers and village leaders were visiting the homes of
those listed as deserters. ``We are getting good results and in the
past four days we have been able to apprehend 1,206 deserters,''
said Major S. Vickramasuriya, a military spokesman.
	   A deserter can be court marshaled, but most are offered amnesty
in exchange for returning to uniform.
	   Nearly 14,000 deserters responded to the government's amnesty
offer in May, Vickramasuriya said.
	   Last month, heavy fighting with Tamil Tiger guerrillas in the
north left at least 1,800 dead or missing on both sides, according
to the military.
	   Tamil rebels are fighting for a homeland in the country's north
and east, claiming that they are discriminated against by the
majority Sinhalese who control the government and the military. The
government denies the charge.
	   More than 55,000 people have been killed in the fighting that
started 15 years ago.

Forest fires intensify, closing major highway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Forest fires raged for a fourth straight day in
northern and central Israel Tuesday, temporarily closing a major
highway and forcing thousands of residents to leave their homes.
	   Fires in the Carmel forests blazed out of control near the
northern port city of Haifa and residents of three nearby villages
evacuated the area, some for the second time in two days.
	   In the Western Galilee, fire destroyed 25 acres (100 dunams) of
forest, Israel radio said.
	   In the hills near Jerusalem, fires smoldering since Monday
intensified, sending thick clouds of smoke toward the Jerusalem-Tel
Aviv highway on Tuesday and briefly forcing the closure of the
major thoroughfare.
	   Meanwhile, a court on Tuesday extended the arrest of three
Israeli Arab youths being held on suspicion of having set fire to
wilderness areas near Wadi Ara in northern Israel.
	   Earlier this month, Wadi Ara was the site of clashes between
Israeli Arabs and police over a land dispute.
	   Officials said most of the other blazes were started
accidentally by picnickers who left coals burning in the forest
while visiting during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot that ended
Monday. Unseasonably hot, dry conditions and strong winds in the
region also helped the fires to spread.

	   ORA, Israel (AP) _ In a shooting attack blamed on Palestinian
militants, an Israeli man was killed and a second critically
wounded as they swam in a spring near Jerusalem on Tuesday.
	   Two assailants fired pistol shots at the bathers from close
range and then escaped in the car of the dead man, said Jerusalem
police chief Yair Yitzhaki.
	   The car was later found abandoned a short distance away, close
to an army roadblock on the border between Israel and the West
Bank. Yitzhaki said the assailants apparently fled on foot into
Palestinian-controlled territory.
	   The attack came two days before the Israeli and Palestinian
leaders were to meet in Washington in hopes of concluding an
agreement on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   In the past, Palestinian militant groups have carried out a
number of shooting and bombing attacks on Israelis in hopes of
wrecking Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
	   The shooting occurred near Ora, a cooperative farm southwest of
Jerusalem, near the West Bank. The body of the dead man, covered by
a blanket, lay on a rocky slope near the spring. The second man was
taken in critical condition to nearby Hadassah Hospital.
	   Israel radio said a curfew was imposed on the Palestinian
village of Walajeh, which is close to where the getaway car was
found, Israel radio said.
	   Police and soldiers aided by a helicopter searched the area.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - John Hume, the leader of Northern
Ireland's main Catholic party, on Tuesday received an international
peace prize for playing a key role in brokering the peace agreement
in the province.
	   Hume received the annual Sean MacBride prize from the
International Peace Bureau, a Swiss-based umbrella grouping of 170
organizations lobbying for conflict prevention and peace.
	   The medal was awarded to Hume for his ``decisive role in
breaking the political stalemate in Ulster ... In particular, his
influence was crucial in persuading the IRA to come to the
negotiating table,'' an IPB statement said.
	   The award ceremony took place at the European Parliament in
Brussels. No money is attached to the Sean MacBride prize, which is
named after the Irish Nobel Peace Prize winner who led the IPB from
1974-1985.
	   Hume is also a contender for the Nobel prize to be announced on
Friday.
	   Previous winners of the Sean MacBride prize include Selim
Beslagic, mayor of the Bosnian city of Tuzla, and Mordechai Vanunu,
who is serving an 18-year jail sentence in his native Israel for
giving away nuclear secrets.

Rabuka announces date for election, first under new constitution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ Fiji voters will go to the polls next April
24, Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka announced Tuesday.
	   The election will be the country's first under amendments to the
constitution that came into force this year to ensure fairer
representation and a more democratic government.
	   The amendments removed many of the racially discriminatory
measures introduced in 1990 after the country went through two
military coups in 1987.
	   Rabuka said Parliament would be dissolved next March 20, the end
of the current term of his government.
	   ``Allowing for seven clear days for the president, Ratu Sir
Kamisese Mara, to issue a writ of election, I expect the general
elections to begin on April 24,'' he said.
	   Rabuka also announced he would step down as head of his SVT
party, with a new leader to be elected at its annual meeting this
weekend.
	   Rabuka will seek re-election as prime minister and is only
stepping down as SVT leader because of new party rules that a
person elected to Parliament cannot be leader.
	   Rabuka said talks were under way with the leader of the
Indian-dominated National Federation party, Jai Ram Reddy, with the
aim of forming a coalition that is expected to rule after the
election.
	   Rabuka and Reddy collaborated on the constitutional amendments,
which reduce the number of parliamentary seats guaranteed to
Fijians from 37 to 23 and the number of Indian seats from 27 to 19,
and allow for 25 open or common seats.
	   The changes also provide for a multiparty Cabinet.
	   While Rabuka said informal coalition talks were proceeding,
Reddy said formal talks were urgently needed.
	   ``We have not scheduled a date for formal talks,'' Reddy told
the state-owned Island Network Radio.
	   Reddy said the primary objective was to bring together people of
all the communities into some kind of political corporation,
``which is what we have been harping on about since we signed the
amended constitution.''
	   The new constitution was aimed at alleviating long-held
grievances in the Pacific Island nation, replacing the 1990
document that barred non-native Fijians from becoming prime
minister or president and ensuring native Fijians a parliamentary
majority.
	   Divisions between native Fijians and descendants of Indian,
Chinese and European laborers and traders erupted into two 1987
coups, in which the Fijian-dominated army overthrew the country's
first Indian-dominated government.
	   Indians make up about 46 percent of the population.
	   Since gaining independence from Britain in 1970, indigenous
Fijians _ a Melanesian people who form just over half the total
population _ had opposed granting that title to Indians and
descendants of other non-natives.
	   Adoption of the new constitution was a condition of Fiji's
re-entry into the British Commonwealth.

 &UR; EDs: RECASTS to update with Prodi now saying he is willing to take
back mandate, edits to conform, trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Five days after resigning as premier, Romano Prodi
was reported by his political allies Tuesday to be willing to take
back his job and head another government.
	   Initially, Prodi had virtually ruled out a second mandate,
saying he would not lead a government that did not stick to the
tough economic measures that had cost him the support of hard-line
Communists.
	   But his allies told the ANSA news agency that they had convinced
him to try again to enable the legislature to pass the budget.
	   Prodi's center-left coalition collapsed Friday after the
Communist Refoundation Party withdrew its support over the budget,
which they said did not do enough to stimulate job creation.
	   President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has been meeting with political
leaders since then to try to form a new government. He is expected
to name a new premier this week.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Italy's opposition forces, led by former
Premier Silvio Berlusconi, called for early elections.
	   ``When a government loses its majority it must give the power of
choice back to the citizens,'' Berlusconi said.
	   Prodi's government was the country's second-longest serving
since World War II.

Irianese demand release of traditional leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A group of Irianese on Tuesday
demanded the release of a traditional leader detained in Jayapura
on charges of organizing protests demanding independence for the
remote Indonesian province.
	   The demand to release Theys H. Eluay was conveyed to the
National Commission on Human Rights by about 50 members of the
group, called the Irianese Society in Jakarta.
	   Eluay was arrested last Tuesday at his home in Sentani, a town
south of Irian Jaya's provincial capital, Jayapura.
	   Brig. Gen. Hotman Siagian, chief of the local police, said then
that Theys was ``strongly suspected'' of conducting criminal acts
against the state.
	   His arrest followed the detention of five other Irianese accused
of planning a pro-independence protest in Jayapura, about 3,700
kilometers (2,300 miles) east of Jakarta.
	   News reports said Eluay was accused of organizing a series of
pro-independence protests that flared up in the province in July.
At least two protesters and one policeman were killed.
	   Indonesia took over Irian Jaya, a former Dutch colony in the
western portion of New Guinea Island, in 1963.
	   Since then, a small group of rebels called the Free Papua
Movement has been fighting for independence even though a
U.N.-sponsored vote in 1969 formalized the territory's joining
Indonesia.
	   Tuesday's protesters also demanded the release of all political
prisoners related to the movement from prisons across Indonesia.

Communists in parliament draft constitutional amendments
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists in the Russian parliament have drafted
a series of constitutional amendments that would sharply limit
President Boris Yeltsin's powers, but there is little chance for
their approval, lawmakers said Tuesday.
	   The amendments would give the parliament's lower house, the
State Duma, more say over Cabinet appointments and dismissals and
strengthen the parliament's control over the use of armed forces on
Russian territory.
	   Under the current constitution, the Duma has the right to
approve a prime minister but doesn't have any say over other
Cabinet appointments. The parliament also has few levers to
influence the government's course, including use of military force.
	   ``We expect that all those amendments will fail,'' Vladimir
Ryzhkov, a deputy Duma speaker of the moderate Our Home Is Russia
faction, said Tuesday.
	   Ryzhkov said that Our Home and other Duma factions want to
``show the Communists that they aren't the predominant power in
Russia's political system,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Communists and their hard-line allies control about half of
Duma's 450 seats _ still far short of the required two-thirds
majority of 300 votes needed to pass constitutional amendments.
	   ``We consider it vitally important that the constitutional
amendments be based on political consensus,'' Ryzhkov told
reporters.
	   The agenda-setting Duma council scheduled a debate on the
proposed amendments for Wednesday. Lawmakers will also discuss two
draft bills on convening a constitutional assembly _ a body that
would prepare even more sweeping changes in Russia's basic law.
	   Those bills also have scant chance for passage, Ryzhkov said.

	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ The Saudi Hollandi Bank, partially
owned by the Netherlands ABN-Amro Bank, made a net profit of 195.4
million riyals (dlrs 52 million) for the first nine months of this
year, the bank said in a statement Tuesday.
	   The profit was an increase of 22 percent from 160 million riyals
(dlrs 42.7 million) a year earlier, the statement said.
	   The bank said the greatest profit increases came from foreign
exchange gains.
	   The bank had only limited investments in emerging markets, badly
hit by a financial slump in Russia, Eastern Europe, Malaysia and
Indonesia, said the statement, quoting bank manager Herman Erbe.
	   The Saudi Hollandi Bank, in which ABN-Amro owns a 40 percent
stake, is a leading commercial bank in Saudi Arabia. It is listed

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The semi-independent Investment Promotion
Corp. has mapped out a strategy to encourage foreign investment in
Jordan, the corporation's director said on Tuesday.
	   Muntasser Uqlah said the strategy, drawn up recently in
cooperation with the U.S. Agency for International Development,
targets underdeveloped industrial sectors.
	   He said unspecified foreign firms have been selected as
potential investors. He declined to identify them, but said that
Jordan will offer them incentives to invest in mining, tourism,
electronics, computer programing, textiles and pharmaceuticals.
	   Uqlah said IPC will soon launch a promotion campaign worldwide,
to inform investors about Jordanian laws and regulations and
incentives.
	   Jordan pins hopes that a flow of foreign capital will help ease
the burdens of dlrs 6.1 foreign debt. The government has introduced
flexible investment laws, which offer foreigners tax exemptions and
equal ownership rights to Jordanians.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Germany agreed on Tuesday to loan Jordan
dlrs 26.3 million to finance two waste water projects, a German
Embassy statement said.
	   It said under the first project Germany will loan Jordan 30
million Deutsche marks (dlrs 18.4 million) to complete a sewage
network in the northern town of al-Samrah.
	   Under the second project, Bonn will pay Jordan 13 million marks
(dlrs 7.9 million) to expand the sewage network in the northern
city of Irbid, the largest populated area after the capital, Amman,
the statement said.
	   It said the loan agreement was signed by Planning Minister Nabil
Ammari and German Ambassador Peter Mende.
	   Details were not immediately available.
	   Germany is one of Jordan's main bank rollers. It spent nearly
dlrs 1 billion since 1970 on infrastructure development projects in
Jordan.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan is cracking down on illegal foreign
workers in an attempt to restructure the Jordanian labor market by
creating jobs for locals, Labor Minister Mohammed Mahdi Farhan said
Tuesday.
	   He said the plan envisages unveiling the exact number of foreign
workers, most of them Arabs who benefit from visa exemptions to
come here and work without a labor ministry permit.
	   ``Then we will start reviewing the need for foreign labor in
certain economic sectors where there could be no Jordanian
replacement,'' Farhan told reporters.
	   He said that since the crackdown began on Oct. 2, nearly 12,000
foreign workers have obtained permits, raising the total number of
licensed foreign labor to 75,000.
	   He confirmed Interior Ministry records that Jordan is host to
nearly 1 million foreigners, the bulk of them are Arabs working
without license.
	   Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh, who took office Aug. 20, pledged
to fight unemployment, which is officially set at 14.4 percent of
the 3.8 million population. Unofficial estimates are double the
figure.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ More than 100 scientists from 35 countries will
meet in this oil-rich state next month to discuss energy and the
environment, Kuwait News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   Sami al-Fahed, one of the organizers of the international
conference, told the state-run agency that the three-day meeting
will open Nov. 9. Topics of research papers include energy
conservation, increasing the efficiency of power stations,
renewable sources of energy, and the effect of power generation on
the environment.
	   Some 35 companies from the Gulf area, Japan and Germany are
expected to exhibit their energy-related products and operations
during the meeting, KUNA reported.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Almost half of Iraq's 12 million portable
gas tanks used in homes pose a threat to users due to dangerous
leaks, Oil Minister Lt. Gen. Amer Mohammed Rashid said in remarks
published Tuesday.
	   Rashid told the official al-Ittihad weekly that his ministry has
allocated dlrs 4.5 million to repair the leaking tanks and install
new valves.
	   Iraq wholly relies on cylinders for its domestic gas consumption
and Rashid said the ministry circulates more than 110 million
cylinders a year.
	   The magazine did not make clear where the money will come from.
It also did not say whether the import of spare parts will fall
under the country's oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.
	   Rashid said about 30 percent of cylinders in Iraq were beyond
repair and had to be replaced.
	   Iraq has huge gas reserves _ both of natural gas and liquefied
petroleum gas _ totaling 3,100 billion cubic meters (4,030 billion
cubic yards).
	   Iraq announced in August that it found a new gas field in the
desert west of Baghdad with reserves of about 600 billion cubic
meters (780 billion cubic yards).

Three researchers in America win Nobel Physics Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to RECAST, REORGANIZE, ADD comment on
chemistry prize significance. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Five researchers at U.S. universities
won the Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry on Tuesday for their
advances in quantum science.
	   The physics prize went to Robert C. Laughlin of Stanford
University; Horst L. Stoermer, a German who teaches at Columbia
University; and Daniel C. Tsui, a China-born American citizen
teaching at Princeton.
	   The chemistry prize is shared by Walter Kohn, a Vienna-born
American citizen with the University of California-Santa Barbara,
and John A. Pople, a British citizen teaching at Northwestern
University.
	   Each prize is worth 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) and will
be divided equally among its winners.
	   Both prizes, announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences,
are for discoveries relating to quantum theory, the modern physical
theory that energy and some other physical properties often exist
in tiny, discrete amounts.
	   Quantum theory proposes ways of mathematically understanding
various physical phenomena. It can be especially useful in studying
matter not easily produced in laboratories, such as interstellar
matter.
	   But researchers, especially in chemistry, have been frustrated
by the huge complexity of these calculations.
	   According to the Academy, Kohn's work, done primarily in the
1960s, immensely simplified these processes by showing that it was
not necessary to consider the motion of each individual electron.
Pople developed computational methods that are now widely used.
	   With such methods ''scientists are able to simulate chemical
reactions on the computer, which has helped in the development of
drugs, for example, against HIV,'' said Bjoern Roos, a professor of
theoretical chemistry at Sweden's Lund University.
	   Kohn, 78, developed his theories as a physicist, but later found
they had wide applications in chemistry. Pople, 72, was praised in
the citation not only for his computational advances but for making
them easily accessible to thers through a computer program he
designed.
	   The physics award, like many of the science Nobels, is for work
that is in the rarefied atmosphere of high theory but that deals
with fundamental questions.
	   ``The reason this is important is it has to do with big issues,
why the universe is the way it is,'' Laughlin, 47, of Stanford
University, told The AP by phone as he was having coffee with his
wife at home.
	   Stoermer (pronounced STER-mer), 49, currently is at Columbia
University in New York City and Tsui (TSOO-ee), 59, teaches at
Princeton University.
	   The prize-winning work was done together by Tsui and Stoermer
and elaborated by Laughlin.
	   They discovered a new form of ``quantum fluid,'' which are
fluids such as liquid helium that have certain properties in common
such as superfluidity.
	   What makes these fluids important for researchers is that
``events in a drop of quantum fluid can afford more profound
insights into the general inner structure and dynamics of matter,''
the academy said.
	   It is ``yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics,'' the citation
said.
	   Mats Jonson, a physics professor at Sweden's respected Chalmers
Institute of Technology, said the physics laureates' work could be
important in the development of smaller electronic components and
could lead to improving computer memories.
	   The prize-winning work was done in the early 1980s. Since then,
the development of sophisticated microelectonics has allowed other
researchers to confirm the work's validity, in experiments that the
Academy likened to ``measuring the sound of individual hailstones
during a hailstorm.''
	   The chemistry and physics were the third and fourth of the six

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Five researchers at U.S. universities
won the Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry on Tuesday for their
advances in quantum science.
	   The physics prize went to Robert C. Laughlin of Stanford
University; Horst L. Stoermer, a German who teaches at Columbia
University; and Daniel C. Tsui, a China-born American citizen
teaching at Princeton.
	   The chemistry prize is shared by Walter Kohn, a Vienna-born
American citizen with the University of California-Santa Barbara,
and John A. Pople, a British citizen teaching at Northwestern
University.
	   Each prize is worth 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) and will
be divided equally among its winners.
	   Both prizes, announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences,
are for discoveries relating to quantum theory, the modern physical
theory that energy and some other physical properties often exist
in tiny, discrete amounts.
	   Quantum theory proposes ways of mathematically understanding
various physical phenomena. It can be especially useful in studying
matter not easily produced in laboratories, such as interstellar
matter.
	   But researchers, especially in chemistry, have been frustrated
by the huge complexity of these calculations.
	   According to the Academy, Kohn's work, done primarily in the
1960s, immensely simplified these processes by showing that it was
not necessary to consider the motion of each individual electron.
Pople developed computational methods that are now widely used.
	   With such methods ''scientists are able to simulate chemical
reactions on the computer, which has helped in the development of
drugs, for example, against HIV,'' said Bjoern Roos, a professor of
theoretical chemistry at Sweden's Lund University.
	   Kohn, 78, developed his theories as a physicist, but later found
they had wide applications in chemistry. Pople, 72, was praised in
the citation not only for his computational advances but for making
them easily accessible to thers through a computer program he
designed.
	   The physics award, like many of the science Nobels, is for work
that is in the rarefied atmosphere of high theory but that deals
with fundamental questions.
	   ``The reason this is important is it has to do with big issues,
why the universe is the way it is,'' Laughlin, 47, of Stanford
University, told The AP by phone as he was having coffee with his
wife at home.
	   Stoermer (pronounced STER-mer), 49, currently is at Columbia
University in New York City and Tsui (TSOO-ee), 59, teaches at
Princeton University.
	   The prize-winning work was done together by Tsui and Stoermer
and elaborated by Laughlin.
	   They discovered a new form of ``quantum fluid,'' which are
fluids such as liquid helium that have certain properties in common
such as superfluidity.
	   What makes these fluids important for researchers is that
``events in a drop of quantum fluid can afford more profound
insights into the general inner structure and dynamics of matter,''
the academy said.
	   It is ``yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics,'' the citation
said.
	   Mats Jonson, a physics professor at Sweden's respected Chalmers
Institute of Technology, said the physics laureates' work could be
important in the development of smaller electronic components and
could lead to improving computer memories.
	   The prize-winning work was done in the early 1980s. Since then,
the development of sophisticated microelectonics has allowed other
researchers to confirm the work's validity, in experiments that the
Academy likened to ``measuring the sound of individual hailstones
during a hailstorm.''
	   The chemistry and physics were the third and fourth of the six
Nobels to be given this year.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   Their finding helped lead to the discovery of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra and could also pay off in new treatments for heart
disease, cancer and septic shock.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago. The economics prize winner is to be named
on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
	   All the prizes are announced in Stockholm, except for the peace
prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes

Family of two Palestinian prisoners demand their release

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Relatives of two Palestinian brothers
convicted of murdering two Israelis on Tuesday demanded their
release from a Palestinian prison, saying they were innocent.
	   Brothers Yousef and Shaher Rai have served three years of a
seven-year sentence in the West Bank town of Jericho prison.
	   Shaher's wife, Manal, told a news conference that the brothers
have been on a hunger strike for 21 days and plan to refuse food
and drink until they are released. Mrs. Rai visited her husband
last week and said he and his brother were weak.
	   In 1995, the Rai brothers were arrested and convicted by a
Palestinian court of the killing of two Israeli hikers in a remote
area near Jericho.
	   Mrs. Rai claimed that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat knew that
the brothers were innocent, but decided to keep them in prison
because he fears a backlash from Israel.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has specifically named
the Rai brothers as an example of Arafat's alleged policy of
arresting terror suspects for show and then quietly releasing them.
Netanyahu has said the two brothers were not serving time in jail
but were spotted sipping coffee in Jericho cafes. Jericho prison
officials have denied the accusations.
	   Israel has demanded that the Palestinian Authority hand over
Palestinians accused of murdering Israelis as one of the conditions
for moving forward on peace talks.

Slovenian President Kucan begins two-day visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with presidents' statement on Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The presidents of Poland and Slovenia said
Tuesday that they expect Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic will
keep his agreement to end the conflict in the Kosovo region.
	   Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski said Poland is ready to
send observers to Kosovo within the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which is headed by Poland this year.
	   ``The solution of the problem is really in the hands of
Milosevic and of the Albanian leaders,'' Kwasniewski said. ``The
international community can only encourage them toward peace and
dialogue.''
	   Slovenian President Milan Kucan, who arrived Tuesday for a
two-day visit, stressed that the international community cannot
tolerate the violation of human rights in Kosovo.
	   ``Nobody wants to take Serbia's sovereignty,'' Kucan said.
	   The six-nation Contact Group set conditions to Yugoslav leaders
in an attempt to end the violence in Kosovo, which has left
hundreds dead and an estimated 275,000 homeless. They include an
immediate end to hostilities and withdrawal of armed forces from
the province as well as acceptance of international force to
oversee the compliance with the conditions.
	   Kucan also is expected to discuss Slovenia's efforts to be
admitted to the NATO, supported by Poland, during talks with
Kwasniewski and Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek. He will probably also
discuss enlargement of the European Union.
	   Poland and Slovenia are among six nations that open negotiations
Nov. 10 on future EU membership.
	   Kucan also will visit the construction site for a branch of the
Slovenian pharmaceutical factory Krka.
	   Poland and Slovenia have become close allies and trading
partners since establishing diplomatic ties in 1992. Last year's
trade topped dlrs 194 million.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ A rocket slammed into an open field on
the eastern edge of Afghanistan's beleaguered capital on Tuesday,
killing three people, including a 10-year-old boy.
	   A second rocket hit the combined military and civilian airport
in the capital, Kabul, but Taliban officials at the airport said
there were no injuries and no damage.
	   No one took immediate responsibility for the attack but it is
believed to have been fired by soldiers belonging to the
anti-Taliban opposition.
	   Witnesses saw three bodies wrapped in white sheets being carried
into a home near where the rocket landed in an area known as Kolai
Wazir. Neighbors said the victims were in the field when the rocket
smashed into the field.
	   At the hospitals, workers said an elderly man was in serious
condition with shrapnel wounds from the explosion, which also
injured two others.
	   The Taliban is waging a bitter struggle with its opponents, who
control barely 10 percent of the country. The Taliban rule in the
other 90 percent.
	   However, the opposition is within rocket range of the capital of
Kabul and has previously fired on the city.

Order to halt illegal logging met with skepticism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's agriculture minister
ordered a crackdown on illegal logging Tuesday, a move that drew
muted praise and heavy skepticism from environmentalists.
	   Agriculture minister Tao Seng Huor sent a letter to the National
Forestry Department calling for ``serious measures'' against the
illegal trade, which has deprived the cash-strapped Cambodian
treasury of millions of dollars in export duties each year.
	   The felling of Cambodia's forests is proceeding at such an
alarming rate that environmental groups estimate there will be no
more commercially valuable trees left to cut in five years.
	   ``Every anarchic activity in log transporting, including the
purchasing and selling of timber, must be immediately stopped,''
Tao Seng Huor wrote.
	   The agriculture minister's letter included orders to halt the
export of any illegally felled logs collected by the government and
any timber that received government tax exemptions.
	   The collection and sale of illegally felled logs by the
government is seen by environmentalists as a loophole that allows
corrupt army units and government officials to profit from the
trade despite restrictions on the amount of timber that is supposed
to be cut and exported.
	   Timber companies with legal concessions are still allowed to
operate, the minister said, but each shipment of logs must be
authorized by the forestry department before export.
	   The environmental group Global Witness welcomed Tao Seng Huor's
letter, but the London-based organization said the order was
similar to previous directives that have had no real effect on the
timber trade.
	   ``It sounds good, but we've seen all this before,'' Global
Witness director Patrick Alley said by telephone from the group's
office in England.
	   Global Witness said saving Cambodia's forests will require the
personal endorsement of a sustainable forestry policy by Cambodian
leader Hun Sen, who the environmentalists say is the only
government official with enough power to break the chain of
corruption.
	   A sustainable forestry policy was completed earlier this year by
the forestry department with the help of the World Bank, but it is
has not been implemented.
	   ``What we really need to happen is that Hun Sen has to put his
political will power behind this,'' Alley said.
	   Global Witness said a September research trip to the
Cambodia-Vietnam border revealed the timber trade has not abated.
	   The group witnessed hundreds of barges loaded with logs sailing
down the Mekong River toward Vietnam and on one day shot video
footage of a convoy of 80 logging trucks crossing the border, Alley
said.
	   The government's inability to curb illegal logging and collect
timber export tax revenues led the International Monetary Fund to
withhold dlrs 60 million in subsidized loans to Cambodia in 1996
and 1997.
	   The IMF withdrew its staff from Cambodia last year shortly after
Hun Sen ousted his co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in
a violent coup.

Mixed signals perplex Belgraders: Does this mean no bombs?

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ There was some relief but no
celebrations on Belgrade's streets as Slobodan Milosevic declared
Tuesday that NATO won't bomb Yugoslavia.
	   Many Serbians don't trust their president or his propaganda.
Others said they feared the Yugoslav president has made some secret
deal with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke that will in the end hurt
them the most.
	   ``I don't know what Milosevic promised Holbrooke exactly. But
whatever it is, we should wait and see if he keeps his word,''
unemployed schoolteacher Dragan Petrovic said.
	   ``Not that it'll take us to Europe, the West or make any
difference to our status,'' Petrovic mocked, as he sipped beer in a
downtown Belgrade cafe.
	   Most residents in the Serbian and Yugoslav capital were not
immediately aware Tuesday of news that Milosevic had agreed to a
settlement of the Kosovo crisis following marathon talks with
Holbrooke.
	   State-run Serbian media didn't even mention the breakthrough in
the negotiations that emerged Monday. The media never carried
serious threats made over the past week by NATO and its allies,
publishing only defiant Serbian reactions.
	   But at noon Tuesday, Milosevic made a rare appearance on TV to
declare the NATO strikes were averted.
	   ``Relief, that's all I feel,'' said Marko Milosavljevic, a
Belgrader in his 30s, watching in a cafe as state-run TV repeated
Milosevic's address over and over.
	   ``There will be no bombing now, that's for sure,'' he said, but
added: ``It's because I believe in Holbrooke, not Milosevic.''
	   State TV later carried reaction from unidentified people,
hailing Milosevic's statement as ``super,'' ``great'' and
``absolutely beautiful.''
	   But the difficulty in finding such emotion or strong reaction in
the streets suggested the broadcast was another example of
state-controlled media putting a pro-Milosevic spin on the story.
	   State-run media didn't even bother to report that the NATO
alliance early Tuesday had given Milosevic four days to comply with
international demands or face airstrikes.
	   ``One would expect people to dance in the streets with joy,''
said Dragica Stankovic, mother of three. ``Instead, we are so
passive _ we've been kept in the dark for so long while others
decided our destiny.''
	   Only hours before Milosevic made the TV address _ his first in
three years _ an agitated taxi driver complained as he drove a
group of journalists to the Hyatt hotel where Holbrooke was
staying.
	   ``What kind of a president is he? Why doesn't Milosevic tell us
what will happen?'' he complained. ``What he is deciding in our
name?''
	   ``Fear is the dominant feeling here _ people are aware that they
have a president and a clique around him who rule by gambling with
human lives,'' psychologist Zarko Korac told the independent Nasa
Borba daily.
	   If the fear drags on for too long, it hammers individuals into
passivity, a state of numbness, Korac elaborates.
	   Signs of cautious optimism are rare and mostly among those close
to the news business.
	   ``Perhaps I can breathe a sigh of relief now, maybe go and see a
soccer game,'' said Danijel Bukumirovic, a radio reporter at the
independent B-92 station.
	   War rhetoric still runs high in state-owned media, lashing out
against the West, accusing it of ``the worldwide anti-Serb
conspiracy.''
	   In an editorial Tuesday, the official Borba daily blamed America
and Britain, comparing NATO threats of airstrikes to Nazi
propaganda and war-mongering of the Third Reich.
	   Just for good measure, the commentary threw in several
references to historic suffering of Serbs under foreign invaders.
	   ``Small and peaceful Serbia will once again be attacked... if
they (NATO) decide they feel like,'' Borba says, adding: ``What can
we do but be ready?'

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo Albanians and Serbs breathed
a sigh of relief Tuesday that NATO missiles and bombs wouldn't be
exploding around them immediately, but few expressed any real
optimism about the future.
	   Slate-gray skies and a steady, daylong rainfall seemed fit
accompaniment for the mood of Pristina, capital of this poor
southern province of Serbia, the dominant force in the two
remaining states of the Yugoslav Federation.
	   Mirko, 50, a Serb refugee who fled the Krajina region of Bosnia
during the three-year conflict there, was depressed about the deal
American negotiator Richard Holbrooke struck with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   ``He will sell Kosovo in the same way he sold Krajina,'' said
Mirko, who wouldn't give his last name. ``I have no idea where I'm
supposed to go now. If I have to run once again, I'll kill
myself.''
	   Stevo, a pensioner in his 70s sitting at the same restaurant
table in central Pristina, said agreement was better than
bombardment.
	   ``He couldn't fight the whole world,'' he said of Milosevic.
``This is all an American plot. They want to destroy small
nations.''
	   Atifete Celaj, 23, an ethnic Albanian refugee woman driven from
her home and now living outdoors near Kishna Reka, 30 kilometers
(20 miles) southwest of Pristina, doesn't have much faith in
international civilian observers.
	   ``Until observers come here and give us security, and not just
any security, we are not going back home,'' she said. ``He
(Milosevic) is saying that I am going to be secure, but we don't
believe him any more.''
	   Albanian political leaders took a cautious attitude.
	   ``We welcome NATO's dedication to stop the genocide in Kosovo,
but we have had very bitter experience in the past with this
regime, so we have to wait and see if compliance is going to take
place or not,'' said Alush Gashi, foreign affairs secretary of the
ethnic Albanian LDK party.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, the loosely organized rebel force
that has been struggling against Serbian forces since its founding
in 1996, declared a unilateral cease-fire last week, but it said in
a statement Tuesday that Serbian forces continue to shell, burn and
raid ethnic Albanian villages.
	   The statement, signed by the KLA main headquarters, called on
all political parties ``to create a government of national
salvation to lead the negotiations for the independence of
Kosovo.''
	   ``We will not accept that one party decides the fate of the
nation of Kosovo,'' the statement in Albanian said. ``The existing
group is unacceptable and we insist on their withdrawal from the
negotiations.''
	   Adem Demaci, a politician who claims his views reflect those of
the KLA, said Kosovo was entering ``a new day, a new situation, new
circumstances,'' but he couldn't guarantee the KLA cease-fire would
continue.
	   ``Until now KLA has agreed on a cease-fire, but the police and
military forces of Serbia have to agree on that in order to have a
long-lasting cease-fire. It is the turn of the police and military
forces to prove that,'' he said.
	   The most optimistic note was struck, unsurprisingly, by Veljko
Odalovic, governor of the Kosovo region around Pristina.
	   ``NATO and the international community are knocking on an open
door,'' he said. ``There are no clashes. We are employing our
utmost effort to normalizing conditions. Displaced persons are
going back to their homes. Through humanitarian centers and other
efforts we are trying to enhance the return of life in villages
which people have fled because of terrorists.''
	   Fahrija, a middle-aged Muslim sitting at the same restaurant
table as Mirko and Stevo, didn't have kind words for Milosevic.
	   ``I couldn't believe my ears,'' he said of Milosevic's brief
television speech. ``I couldn't believe what he was telling us. Two
hundred good men (policemen) got killed here. Now he can explain
that to their families.''

Canadian minister urges Indonesia to take steps against violence

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A Canadian Cabinet minister urged
Indonesia Tuesday to take action to stop a spiral of violence and
to prosecute those who were behind deadly riots in May that
targeted members of the Chinese minority.
	   Secretary of State for Asia Pacific Raymond Chan also warned
that the threat of more civil unrest could affect Indonesia's
attempts to reform its political system and hold democratic and
fair elections next year.
	   ``For us the violence is hanging a cloud over the political
process,'' he told a news conference.
	   More than 1,200 people were killed in May's riots.
	   Much of the violence, which forced President Suharto to quit
after 32 authoritarian years in power, was directed against the
Chinese.
	   They are resented by some for their success in business and
commerce as Indonesia grapples with its worst economic crisis in
decades, which has brought soaring inflation and rising poverty.
	   Human rights and women's groups say that at least 168 girls and
women, many of them Chinese, were raped.
	   Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, has appointed an
independent inquiry into allegations that the riots were organized.
	   A committee investigating the matter is scheduled to present its
report later this month.
	   Chan, who held talks with Habibie Tuesday, said he did not want
to prejudge the outcome of the investigation. However, the
government should act quickly if the report does find that the
violence was organized, he said.
	   ``Those who are responsible should be held responsible,'' Chan
said.
	   Chan said the nature of the violence, particularly against
ethnic Chinese, was unfortunate and troublesome and produced
``great concern'' among Canadians, particularly within its Chinese
community.
	   Reports of the rapes and violence galvanized outrage among
Chinese communities around the world. The governments of China and
Taiwan have also called for action against those responsible for
the riots.

Young Iraqi cancer victim thanks Blair, prepares to return home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ An Iraqi girl who came to Britain six months ago
for leukemia treatment delivered a note thanking Prime Minister
Tony Blair on Tuesday as she prepared to return home with her
cancer in remission.
	   Mariam Hamza, 4, managed to walk a few steps to the doorstep of
10 Downing St. to drop off the letter, which was written by her
parents.
	   The little girl, who planned to leave for home Wednesday, told
Blair she had made so many friends in Britain that she didn't want
to leave.
	   Mariam was brought to Britain in April by lawmaker George
Galloway, a left-wing member of Britain's governing Labor Party.
	   Galloway, who met Mariam during a visit to Iraq, said he wanted
to highlight the suffering of the Iraqi public as a result of U.N.
sanctions that ban air travel and most commercial dealings with
that country. The gesture was criticized by other lawmakers and by
Iraq, which accused Britain of meddling in its business.
	   Mariam spent Monday saying goodbye to medical staff at Yorkhill
Children's Hospital in Glasgow, Scotland, before arriving in London
to deliver the note to Blair.
	   ``Thank you for letting me come and for helping to make me
better,'' said the letter, signed with a thumbprint. ``And please
Mr. Blair, please remember the other children of Iraq.''
	   Galloway will accompany the girl and her grandmother back home.
The party planned to leave Wednesday for Jordan and then fly on to
Baghdad the next day, with special U.N. permission for the flight.
	   The cancer treatment cost 55,000 pounds (dlrs 93,000), which was
paid for by private donations.

Homes in northern Russia left without gas because of debts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Hundreds of thousands of homes in a northern
Russian city have been left without gas because the local gas
provider has no money, a news report said Tuesday.
	   Some 110,000 apartments in Arkhangelsk _ about half of all
gas-stove users in the city _ have been left without gas, some of
them for longer than a month, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported,
citing the deputy chief of the Arkhangelsk gas supplier, Igor
Shpakovsky.
	   The gas supplier is owed about 14.5 million rubles (dlrs
918,000) by consumers, and cannot afford to buy gas, Shpakovsky
said.
	   The report did not specify whether the money was owed by private
gas-stove users, or organizations.
	   Arkhangelsk is located about 960 kilometers (600 miles) north of
Moscow.
	   Most state and private companies in Russia are caught in a
tangled web of mutual debts, and outages of electricity, gas and
other utilities have become common.

Serbian politicians cautiously welcome agreement on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian politicians on Tuesday
welcomed a deal President Slobodan Milosevic made on Kosovo, but
warned only substantial democratic reforms could bring long-term
peace in the Balkans.
	   ``We support any kind of agreement, that is the way to avoid
innocent victims,'' said Slobodan Vuksanovic, deputy leader of the
Democratic Party, the oldest opposition party in Serbia.
	   ``But we think that for a stable situation in Serbia we need
much more political actions. We need a democratic situation in
Serbia, we need support for democratic forces in Serbia,'' added
Vuksanovic.
	   Vuksanovic's words reflect a widespread belief among Serbia's
parties of democratic opposition that stability in the whole of
Balkans depends on the overall political and economic reforms, and
introduction of democracy in the region.
	   Serbia's opposition parties have warned that the West should
support democratic reforms in Serbia instead of negotiating with
Milosevic. Pro-democracy forces have criticized international
threats of intervention saying they only help Milosevic strengthen
his grip on power.
	   ``Only change of rule here and change of policies could stop
years-long decay and isolation of our country, said Zoran Djindjic,
Democratic Party leader.
	   Vuk Draskovic, who in the past led many anti-government protests
but stood by Milosevic throughout the Kosovo crisis, said Tuesday's
agreement ``averted the danger of NATO aggression, averted the
bombs and all misery those bombs could produce.''
	   Draskovic too said he hoped the agreement ``opened door to a
change of our state policy, to substantial reforms, political and
economic.''

Faeroes government minister charged with rape of 17-year-old girl
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ A key Faeroe Islands government
minister has been charged with raping a 17-year-old girl who rented
a room in his home three years ago, Danish newspapers reported
Tuesday.
	   John Petersen, ministry of fisheries for the Danish island
territory, denied the allegation but refused further comment to the
news media.
	   Faeroe Chief of Police Mogens Nepper-Christensen told Danish
newspapers that Petersen, 50, was arraigned on rape charges last
week, but was released pending a police investigation. Police now
have to determine whether there are grounds to bring Petersen to
trial.
	   Nepper-Christensen was out of his office, and could not
immediately be reached by telephone to confirm the reports, which
were carried by most major Danish news media.
	   Charges were brought against Petersen after a local newspaper on
the islands, OE-Tidende, last week published a statement from the
girl claiming that the politician had raped her when she was 17 and
lived in his home in 1995, the reports said.
	   Petersen, a member of the conservative Folkaflokkurin party,
began his second term as fisheries minister this year. His post is
one of the most important in the Faeroe Islands government because
fish make up 97 percent of the islands' exports. The charges had no
immediate impact on his political post.
	   The Faeroes, an 18-island archipelago midway between Iceland and
Scotland, is a Danish territory with limited self-rule.

Bulgaria to lay off 4,000 in defense industry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria will lay off 4,000 workers in
its defense industry by the end of this year as a part of program
to restructure it, the state news agency BTA reported Tuesday.
	   It quoted deputy minister of industry Vladimir Kisyov as saying
the cuts will affect 99 weapons producers and 285 related companies
which currently employ a total of 44,000 people.
	   Bulgaria's potent arms industry has been largely idled after the
end of the Cold War because it lost traditional markets in the
former Soviet bloc and the Middle East.
	   The government is planning to privatize the main weapons
manufacturers.
	   Since Soviet times Bulgaria has been specializing in producing
small arms and munitions, portable antiaircraft and anti-tank
missiles, artillery units, armored vehicles and communication
systems.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliament defied appeals from
President Leonid Kuchma and decided Tuesday to discuss the
government's handling of a growing economic crisis and possibly to
hold a no-confidence vote.
	   The leftist-dominated Verkhovna Rada voted 296-24 to consider
the motion, one day after Kuchma said such action would only
``aggravate the situation in the country'' and hurt the economy.
	   ``Nobody would win, no political force would benefit from that,
and ordinary people would suffer, as usual,'' the president said.
	   Immediately after the vote, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko
presented a report on the government's performance in 1998 and
attacked his leftist foes.
	   ``As economic problems get worse, the Cabinet is finding itself
in the midst of a political struggle,'' Pustovoitenko said. ``This
undermines the government's authority and raises doubts about its
ability to overcome the crisis.''
	   A no-confidence motion needs a simple majority vote to be
approved by the 450-seat legislature. Ukraine's 1996 constitution
says the government would then need to resign, but does not specify
the procedure.
	   Kuchma said Monday that if the Communist-led opposition went
ahead with the no-confidence motion, he would not interfere. He
said he would offer Communist leader Petro Symonenko the prime
minister's job and let the opposition try to solve the country's
problems.
	   But Symonenko was undeterred, saying the government was more
corrupt than the ``Italian mafia.''
	   ``We are convinced that the government should be made to resign
and the course should be changed,'' Symonenko told parliament.
	   A leader of the centrist opposition Hromada party, Julia
Timoshenko, also called on fellow lawmakers to bring down the
government.
	   ``Today, parliament is capable of changing Ukraine's fate,'' she
said.
	   Ukraine, a former Soviet republic of 50 million people, has
suffered badly from the economic crisis in neighboring Russia.
Inflation has soared, causing foreign investors to withdraw from
Ukraine's shaky financial market. The national hryvna currency has
lost 71 percent of its value so far this year, according to
Pustovoitenko.
	   The government also has heavy domestic and foreign debts,
industrial output is falling and budget revenues remain billions of
dollars off target because of the inability to collect taxes.
	   Pustovoitenko told parliament that his Cabinet had managed to
ease the crisis through the recent conversion of government bonds
and tight controls over the currency market, but admitted that the
situation remained critical.
	   He said the government planned to support selected industries,
stimulate banking activities and investments and amend the complex
tax system that has discouraged some foreign investors from coming
to Ukraine.
	   Pustovoitenko also promised to support private businesses and
focus more on privatization, which has stalled in recent months.

Thai Cabinet approves scaled-down elevated rail project
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Cabinet on Tuesday approved
reviving a scaled-down version of an elevated rail project that was
halted in January when the government terminated its contract with
Hong Kong-based contractor Hopewell.
	   The plan, approved in principle, calls for the state railway to
make most of the investment, now reduced to less than half the
original 80 billion baht (dlrs 2.1 billion). The state railway
would invest 23.72 billion baht (dlrs 619.3 million), and the
private sector 12.88 billion baht (dlrs 336.4 million).
	   Transport Minister Suthep Thaugsuban told reporters the
government planned to borrow 30 billion baht (dlrs 783.3 million)
from the German government and state-owned development bank
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau to get the stalled project running.
	   He said the German government has agreed in principle to lend
some funds to the Transport Ministry, adding that the two sides
will begin detailed talks on the loan next week.
	   In January, the government terminated the contract between the
Thai unit of Gordon Wu's Hong Kong-based Hopewell Holdings Ltd. and
the Transport Ministry to build a multi-layered road and rail
system in Bangkok.
	   Thai authorities said they terminated the contract due to long
delays.
	   Hopewell's Wu said recently the company is seeking 100 billion
baht (dlrs 2.6 billion) in compensation for termination of the
contract. But the government maintains it suffered losses from
delays in construction and will not pay compensation.
	   Under the plan proposed earlier this year by the Transport
Ministry, the government would build the rail structure for the
project, allowing the private sector to operate the system.
	   The Cabinet approved a proposal from the ministry to spend up to
100 million baht (dlrs 2.6 million) to hire an independent adviser
for the elevated rail project. The adviser would help the ministry
decide how to reduce the project in view of the architectural and
engineering possibilities as well as Thailand's limited financial
resources.
	   The Cabinet also assigned the Office of the Attorney-General to
form a committee to deal with legal problems should Hopewell
Holdings sue the ministry, Suthep said.

OSCE is Europe's security and human rights watchdog
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- In overseeing Yugoslav compliance with
the agreement to end the Kosovo crisis, the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe will be playing a key role for
which it was established -- preventing the spread of armed conflict
on the continent.
	   The primary mission of the 54-nation OSCE, whose membership has
been expanded to include some Asian republics of the former Soviet
Union, is to serve as a ``primary instrument for early warning,
conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict
rehabilitation in Europe.''
	   The 54-nation OSCE, headquartered in Vienna, Austria, was set up
following a conference of European countries, the United States and
Canada that produced the Helsinki Final Act in 1975 _ a key
document signed by western and Communist countries.
	   The agreement, considered a landmark in efforts to ease Cold War
tensions in Europe, established the basic principles governing the
behavior of governments toward their citizens and each other.
	   It also set up a system of international monitoring of human and
democratic rights in the Soviet bloc, which contributed to the
collapse of communist rule in Eastern Europe.
	   Ambassadors from the United States and other member states meet
regularly in Vienna to discuss regional issues and to review member
states' compliance with principles of the 1975 conference.
	   At a summit of signatory powers in Budapest, Hungary in 1994,
the group's name was changed from the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in an effort to project it as a
lasting institution.
	   While critics cite the OSCE's lack of political clout in
prevening regional wars or other conflict, the organization has
played a key role in monitoring and even organizing elections in
former Communist countries, including Bosnia.
	   In Bosnia, the OSCE has supervised the reduction of arms under
an agreement signed by the former warring parties.
	   In Kosovo, some 2,000 OSCE monitors are to supervise
implementation of measures for the pacification of the wartorn
republic under an agreement reached by U.S. mediator Richard
Holbrooke with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.

Doctors say ex-wife fit to stand trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Court-appointed psychologists testified
Tuesday that the ex-wife of fashion scion Maurizio Gucci was sane
and fit to stand trial for his slaying.
	   The report, which Judge Renato Samek Lodovici authorized at the
request of Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli's lawyers, represented a
serious blow to the defense strategy.
	   Her lawyers had argued that after a 1992 brain tumor operation,
she had lost the ability to reason and to judge.
	   Therefore, they maintained, she wasn't psychologically able to
issue a mandate for his killing.
	   Gucci was gunned down on the steps of his Milan office on March
27, 1995.
	   In January, 1997, on the basis of information given to police by
an informant, Reggiani Martinelli, her close friend Pina Auriemma
and three men were arrested.
	   All five are charged with premediated murder and risk life
imprisonment. There is no death penalty in Italy.
	   Based on interviews and tests, the psychologists said that
Reggiani Martinelli has a narcissistic personality disorder that
explained her behavior, but which did not mean she was out of
control or out of touch with reality.
	   ``Just because you go around with your nose in the air and are
easily offended doesn't mean you aren't an ordinary citizen like
you and me,'' said Mario Portigliatti Barbos, director of the
Institute of Forensic Science at the University of Turin.
	   ``There was no evidence, now as then, of a pathological state,''
said Professor Salvatore Luberto, director of the School of
Clinical Criminology of the University of Modena.
	   Reggiani Martinelli listened attentively to the testimony,
seated in the front of the courtroom flanked by her lawyers.
	   The defense also argues that although she openly expressed her
hatred for Gucci and repeatedly asked friends to help her find a
killer, she never meant to carry out her threats.
	   THer lawyers claim that codefendant Pina Auriemma took it upon
herself to put the plan into action and then extorted dlrs 363,000
through threats. Auriemma, who confessed before the trial started
in May, said she contacted the men who carried out the murder at
Reggiani Martinelli's obsessive insistence.

Firefighters battle scores of blazes throughout Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) - Hundreds of firefighters, soldiers and
civilians battled fires Monday that have already destroyed 1.75
million square meters (2.1 million square yards) of pine forest and
olive and citrus groves.
	   The fire brigade and civil defense forces have canceled all
vacations to mobilize more people to fight the fires.
	   The government also sent soldiers to battle the blazes and U.N.
peacekeepers deployed north of the border with Israel have used
helicopters to drop water on the fires.
	   The blazes began this weekend in the wooded hills of Batroun in
northern Lebanon. They spread quickly to areas that were unusually
dry due to a recent heat wave.
	   Some 150 fires have been reported in areas ranging from the
outskirts of Tripoli, 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Beirut, to
villages south of the port city of Tyre, 60 miles (100 kilometers)
south of the capital.

Belarus condemns former communist states' cooperation with NATO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko
condemned three former Soviet-era allies Tuesday for saying they
would allow NATO planes to fly through their airspace on the way to
bomb Yugoslavia.
	   During a visit to food-storage enterprises in Minsk, Lukashenko
said Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary had offered to open up their
airspace because they are trying to ``weasel their way into NATO.''
	   ``If I were in the place of these leaders, I would think before
pledging to allow this passage. It is like complicity in the crimes
now prepared for the Balkans,'' he said.
	   Belarus, along with Russia, is strongly opposed to threatened
NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia. NATO has said Yugoslavia risks
being bombed if it does not end its crackdown against the ethnic
Albanians who dominate the southern province of Kosovo and withdraw
troops from the area immediately.
	   Lukashenko also accused the three countries of betraying the
``Slavic unity'' they share with other countries in the region like
Russia, Belarus, and Yugoslavia. However, neither Hungary nor
Romania has Slavic roots.
	   Meanwhile, a group of Belarusian lawmakers flew to Yugoslavia on
Tuesday for a three-day fact-finding mission in Kosovo, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said. The report provided no other details on
the trip.

Four militiamen killed in roadblock removal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Four militiamen were killed and seven
seriously injured when fighters loyal to warlord Hussein Mohamed
Aidid cleared roadblocks set up by rogue fighters to extort money
from drivers on the road leading to southern Somalia, witnesses
said Tuesday.
	   Aidid and northern Mogadishu warlord Ali Mahdi Mohamed have been
trying to set up a joint administration for the war-torn capital.
But fighters from minor militia, fearing they will soon be out of
work, have set up roadblocks between Mogadishu and Afgoe, 50
kilometers west, to extort funds, mainly from truck drivers.
	   The witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Aidid's
fighters used five pickup trucks mounted with weapons in the
fighting Monday.
	   Gunmen at 27 roadblocks were demanding money from motorists
before permitting them to proceed.
	   Afgoe is at a junction of the road into southern Somalia and
another to Merca, a small Indian Ocean natural harbor that is used
as a port for Mogadishu, whose port has been closed since 1995.
Aidid controls Merca.
	   Somalia has had no central government since Aidid's late father
Mohamed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi joined forces to oust dictator
Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. They then turned on each other, and the
country disintegrated civil war and fiefdoms protected by
clan-based militias.

Portugal, South Africa hopeful of energy deal soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ South African Foreign Minister Alfred
Nzo said Tuesday he was hopeful of a breakthrough in lengthy
negotiations with Portugal and Mozambique on energy provisions to
his country.
	   Nzo said during an official visit to Portugal that in the next
few days he expected to receive technical recommendations on the
possible supply of electricity from the Portuguese-built Cahora
Bassa hydroelectric dam in Mozambique, which borders South Africa.
	   Nzo said he was ``very hopeful'' that the report would help
resolve the dispute over how much South Africa should pay for the
electricity.
	   ``What's still under discussion is the tariff question,'' Nzo
told a news conference. ``Our experts will give us their view on
what needs to be done,'' he added.
	   Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said officials were
discussing a new framework for energy provisions from the huge
Cahora Bassa scheme ``in the context of the great potential for
energy provision in southern Africa.''
	   The dam, which was built by the Portuguese before Mozambique
became independent in 1975, never became fully operational during
Mozambique's 15-year civil war.
	   A multinational effort to repair and refurbish the dam, located
on the Zambezi River in northern Mozambique, was completed last
year.
	   However, South Africa reportedly has balked at the price
demanded by Portugal for the electricity.
	   Officials declined to reveal the prices under discussion.

Reyna loses captain's job, dropped from team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WOLFSBURG, Germany (AP) _ Claudio Reyna, the midfielder of the
U.S. World Cup team, has been dropped from the starting lineup of
his Bundesliga team Wolfsburg and has lost the job of captain.
	   Reyna was one of four Wolfsburg starters dropped by coach
Wolfgang Wolf, the newspaper Wolfsburger Nachrichten reported
Tuesday.
	   ``We are not on the same wavelength,'' the coach told the
newspaper.
	   Reyna was dropped for lack of effort and poor performances, the
coach said. His ouster came after Wolfsburg lost 2-0 in an
exhibition game against Oberhausen, bottom-placed team in the
second division.
	   The American was replaced as captain by Frank Greiner. The four
dropped players will not be traveling to Wolfsburg's next
Bundesliga game at champion Kaiserslautern on Friday.
	   Wolfsburg is still winless after seven Bundesliga rounds and is
bottom of the standings with four points.

	   SAINT-DENIS, France (AP) _ French soccer officials will say it
with flowers Wednesday to thank women for their support for the
national soccer team during the recent World Cup.
	   Though soccer is traditionally a male preserve in France, the
spectacular success of ``Les Bleus'' sparked high interest among
women.
	   Now, the French Football Federation is seeking to continue the
momentum by reserving a section of the Stade de France for women at
Wednesday's European Championship qualifying match against Andorra.
	   Ground staff will present every spectator in the section with a
rose.
	   Around 9,000 seats will be available at a reduced rate of 50
francs (dlrs 9). The price will only apply to Wednesday's match.

U.S. first lady talks with intellectuals, ending East Europe tour

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Winding up her tour of Eastern
Europe, Hillary Rodham Clinton discussed civil society with the
world's pundits Tuesday and sipped liqueur in a cafe with the
Havels.
	   Speaking at the Forum 2000, a gathering of over 50 political and
religious activists, the U.S. first lady tried to define civil
society and its role in post-communist countries.
	   ``It is really in that space that life is lived,'' Mrs. Clinton
said about the importance of civil society as a bridge between
economy and government.
	   ``Economy alone cannot create the work ethic capitalism
requires,'' Mrs. Clinton noted. ``Only civil society can do that
important job.''
	   She praised post-communist countries such as Bulgaria and
Slovakia for the progress they have made in building civil society
after decades of totalitarian rule.
	   ``Much of the success in the recent election in Slovakia owes
its roots to the recognition that ... citizen activities were
necessary preconditions for true democratic values,'' she said.
	   Mrs. Clinton was invited to attend the conference by Czech
President Vaclav Havel, a co-sponsor of the conference and a civil
society advocate himself.
	   ``No one has worked harder to nurture civil society,'' Mrs.
Clinton said of Havel.
	   Before lunch, Mrs. Clinton, accompanied by Havel and his wife
Dagmar, stopped briefly in the Slavia cafe, Havel's favorite
hangout in his dissident years, for a glass of absinthe.
	   Young people watching the presidential motorcade in the street
were largely indifferent to Mrs. Clinton's visit, but others inside
the cafe were appreciative.
	   ``She is a very intelligent lady and she has a lot to say to the
world,'' said a woman drinking coffee at a table nearby. She
declined to give her name.
	   The visit to Prague was a continuation of Mrs. Clinton's
four-day trip to Eastern Europe and her second visit to the Czech
Republic in the last two years.
	   She spent the first two days in Bulgaria speaking with students
and businesswomen.
	   Mrs. Clinton was due back in Washington Tuesday night.

U.N. official expresses concern over Kenyan forest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A senior United Nations official Tuesday
expressed concern over the destruction of one of Kenya's few
remaining virgin forests that is adjacent to a U.N. complex in the
Kenyan capital.
	   Sections of Karura Forest on the outskirts of Nairobi have been
allocated to developpers, an action that has sparked outcry among
environmentalists and opposition politicians.
	   On Oct. 7, demonstrators opposed to the upmarket housing
development burned three bulldozers, a truck and the contractor's
office. They also planted seedlings on swaths of forest land that
had been cleared for roads and sewers.
	   While acknowledging that Nairobi was undergoing rapid
urbanization, Klaus Toepfer, executive director of the U.N.
Environment Program and Habitat, said the process, ``must take into
consideration environmental factors. These forests are precious
natural resources which the city simply cannot afford to lose.''
	   Although in his statement, Toepfer did not suggest that the
allocations be nullified, his comments were certain to cheer the
environmental groups that have urged the government to do so.
	   The law permits the government to lease state land to private
users for up to 99 years, but environmentalists accuse government
officials of abusing the legislation by handing out forest land to
supporters of President Daniel arap Moi's ruling Kenya African
National Union.
	   Toepfer said UNEP and Habitat have the necessary experience to
help manage the forest and are willing to work with the government
and the Nairobi City Council.
	   Wangari Maathai, head of the Green Belt Movement which plants
trees nationwide and organized last week's demonstration, has
called on volunteers to plant more seedlings Saturday at Karura
Forest.

Opposition leader's home searched in Lesotho; curfew hours cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Intervention force troops searched an
opposition leader's home for weapons Tuesday but, in a sign
tensions in this kingdom were relaxing, authorities cut back the
hours of a nighttime curfew.
	   The search came as soldiers from South Africa and Botswana _
representing the 14-nation Southern African Development Community _
sought to confiscate weapons and end any resistance to their
three-week-old intervention.
	   Opposition supporters chanted political slogans, including some
against South Africa, as intervention force troops and Lesotho
police searched the home of Mooketsi Ts'atsanyame, a senior member
of the opposition Basutoland Congress Party member, the South
African Press Association reported.
	   Only Ts'atsanyame's licensed firearm was found in the house.
	   The 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew was being immediately cut and would
be in effect from only 9 p.m. to 4 a.m., according to an
announcement by Lesotho police commissioner Maj. Gen. Bolutu
Makoaba.
	   The intervention, which began on Sept. 22, was aimed at crushing
an army mutiny and other unrest in this Belgium-sized country of 2
million people. It resulted in a looting and arson spree that
destroyed most of the capital's business district.
	   Opposition parties and the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy
have tentatively agreed to an SADC-mediated plan to hold new
elections within 18 months. Opposition parties claim the elections
last May, which the LCD won by a landslide, were rigged.

Three researchers in America win Nobel Physics Prize
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Kohn age in graf 10 to 75 sted 78. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Five researchers at U.S. universities
won the Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry on Tuesday for their
advances in quantum science.
	   The physics prize went to Robert C. Laughlin of Stanford
University; Horst L. Stoermer, a German who teaches at Columbia
University; and Daniel C. Tsui, a China-born American citizen
teaching at Princeton.
	   The chemistry prize is shared by Walter Kohn, a Vienna-born
American citizen with the University of California-Santa Barbara,
and John A. Pople, a British citizen teaching at Northwestern
University.
	   Each prize is worth 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000) and will
be divided equally among its winners.
	   Both prizes, announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences,
are for discoveries relating to quantum theory, the modern physical
theory that energy and some other physical properties often exist
in tiny, discrete amounts.
	   Quantum theory proposes ways of mathematically understanding
various physical phenomena. It can be especially useful in studying
matter not easily produced in laboratories, such as interstellar
matter.
	   But researchers, especially in chemistry, have been frustrated
by the huge complexity of these calculations.
	   According to the Academy, Kohn's work, done primarily in the
1960s, immensely simplified these processes by showing that it was
not necessary to consider the motion of each individual electron.
Pople developed computational methods that are now widely used.
	   With such methods ``scientists are able to simulate chemical
reactions on the computer, which has helped in the development of
drugs, for example, against HIV,'' said Bjoern Roos, a professor of
theoretical chemistry at Sweden's Lund University.
	   Kohn, 75, developed his theories as a physicist, but later found
they had wide applications in chemistry. Pople, 72, was praised in
the citation not only for his computational advances but for making
them easily accessible to thers through a computer program he
designed.
	   The physics award, like many of the science Nobels, is for work
that is in the rarefied atmosphere of high theory but that deals
with fundamental questions.
	   ``The reason this is important is it has to do with big issues,
why the universe is the way it is,'' Laughlin, 47, of Stanford
University, told The AP by phone as he was having coffee with his
wife at home.
	   Stoermer (pronounced STER-mer), 49, currently is at Columbia
University in New York City and Tsui (TSOO-ee), 59, teaches at
Princeton University.
	   The prize-winning work was done together by Tsui and Stoermer
and elaborated by Laughlin.
	   They discovered a new form of ``quantum fluid,'' which are
fluids such as liquid helium that have certain properties in common
such as superfluidity.
	   What makes these fluids important for researchers is that
``events in a drop of quantum fluid can afford more profound
insights into the general inner structure and dynamics of matter,''
the academy said.
	   It is ``yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics,'' the citation
said.
	   Mats Jonson, a physics professor at Sweden's respected Chalmers
Institute of Technology, said the physics laureates' work could be
important in the development of smaller electronic components and
could lead to improving computer memories.
	   The prize-winning work was done in the early 1980s. Since then,
the development of sophisticated microelectonics has allowed other
researchers to confirm the work's validity, in experiments that the
Academy likened to ``measuring the sound of individual hailstones
during a hailstorm.''
	   The chemistry and physics were the third and fourth of the six
Nobels to be given this year.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   Their finding helped lead to the discovery of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra and could also pay off in new treatments for heart
disease, cancer and septic shock.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago. The economics prize winner is to be named
on Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
	   All the prizes are announced in Stockholm, except for the peace
prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes
in his will.

Jospin signals opposition to EU farm spending reform plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin on
Tuesday told the European Union he would oppose plans to shift the
burden for subsidizing farmers from the EU common budget to
national treasuries.
	   ``In principle we do not favor a re-nationalization of the
common agricultural policy,'' Jospin told a news conference at EU
headquarters.
	   ``Since we agree that we want to rein in community spending,
then we must deal with the issue at community level.''
	   Jospin spoke after talks with European Commission President
Jacques Santer on planned reforms and budget cuts at the EU before
the Union can expand into eastern Europe.
	   One of the planned budget-saving measures includes letting
governments pay only 75 percent of their contributions to the EU
farm budget and distribute the rest directly to farmers from
national budgets.
	   This would allow the EU to save about dlrs 8 billion a year, but
has provoked objections from France and other nations with large
agricultural sectors.
	   The wrangle over spending is expected to dominate an Oct. 24-25
summit of EU leaders in Austria, and drag on until a deadline for
wrapping up the reform next June.
	   Jospin said the EU should do more to encourage growth and fight
unemployment. ``With the right political will, Europe has the means
to be a zone of relative growth over the next 10 to 15 years.''

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- In overseeing Yugoslav compliance with
the agreement to end the Kosovo crisis, the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe will be playing a key role for
which it was established -- preventing the spread of armed conflict
on the continent.
	   The primary mission of the 54-nation OSCE, whose membership has
been expanded to include some Asian republics of the former Soviet
Union, is to serve as a ``primary instrument for early warning,
conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict
rehabilitation in Europe.''
	   The 54-nation OSCE, headquartered in Vienna, Austria, was set up
following a conference of European countries, the United States and
Canada that produced the Helsinki Final Act in 1975 _ a key
document signed by western and Communist countries.
	   The agreement, considered a landmark in efforts to ease Cold War
tensions in Europe, established the basic principles governing the
behavior of governments toward their citizens and each other.
	   It also set up a system of international monitoring of human and
democratic rights in the Soviet bloc, which contributed to the
collapse of communist rule in Eastern Europe.
	   Ambassadors from the United States and other member states meet
regularly in Vienna to discuss regional issues and to review member
states' compliance with principles of the 1975 conference.
	   At a summit of signatory powers in Budapest, Hungary in 1994,
the group's name was changed from the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in an effort to project it as a
lasting institution.
	   While critics cite the OSCE's lack of political clout in
prevening regional wars or other conflict, the organization has
played a key role in monitoring and even organizing elections in
former Communist countries, including Bosnia.
	   In Bosnia, the OSCE has supervised the reduction of arms under
an agreement signed by the former warring parties.
	   In Kosovo, some 2,000 OSCE monitors are to supervise
implementation of measures for the pacification of the wartorn
province under an agreement reached by U.S. mediator Richard
Holbrooke with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.

U.N. refugee agency resettles 500 from Kuwait in five years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
said Tuesday that during the last five years it has resettled some
500 people from Kuwait, mostly Iraqis who feared returning home.
	   The refugees were mostly resettled in Nordic countries and in
Australia, said Martin Loftus, the agency's chief of mission in
Kuwait.
	   He said some 20 applications were still pending.
	   Most of the refugees were Iraqis who had either lived in Kuwait
before the 1991 Gulf War or had illegally crossed into the emirate
after the fighting.
	   After U.S.-led forces drove Iraqi troops from Kuwait, the
government refused to renew the residency permits of some Iraqis.
Many other Iraqis chose to leave after the war.
	   Last year, Kuwait contributed dlrs 200,000 to the UNHCR, the
country's first such donation to the agency since the Gulf War,
Loftus said.

Police arrest man believed connected to international drug ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Police arrested an Egyptian-born man
suspected of heading an international drug smuggling ring active in
the early 1990s in South America and Europe, authorities said
Tuesday.
	   Michael Antonios, 57, born in Alexandria, Egypt, was arrested in
his home in the southern Athens suburb of Voula on Monday. He had
arrived in Greece via Italy in September on a forged Greek
passport, police said.
	   An arrest warrant for Antonios has been pending since September
1991 when Greek police arrested 22 people accused of smuggling 300
kilograms (661 pounds) of cocaine from Ecuador to Greece and Italy.
	   Antonios was thought to have headed the ring, but he was
allegedly in Ecuador at the time of the arrest, a Greek police
announcement said.
	   Although authorities in Ecuador later arrested him on local drug
charges, they did not extradite him to Greece, the announcement
added.
	   A Dutch police warrant for Antonios' arrest is also pending
since 1994. Amsterdam police believe he was involved in smuggling
860 kilograms (1,895 pounds) of cocaine from Colombia to the
Netherlands.
	   Greek and foreign police authorities are cooperating to
investigate Antonios' possible connection to the Colombian drug
cartel, the announcement said.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The partial handover of Australia's
most secretive intelligence network to a foreign company was a
threat to national security, the main opposition Labor Party said
Tuesday.
	   The Defense Signals Directorate, which is so secretive its
annual budget isn't even made public, has handed over some of its
foreign intelligence gathering to private companies, one of which
is British Aerospace Australia.
	   The handover was made public when British Aerospace advertised
for 40 people with expertise in languages of the Asia-Pacific
region to work in Australia.
	   Labor defense spokesman Arch Bevis said handing such sensitive
work to a foreign-owned company was madness and clearly not in
Australia's interests.
	   ``Not even Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan went this far with
privatization,'' Bevis said.
	   ``Giving British Aerospace Australia a contract to advertise for
and employ language and communications intercept experts has
enormous implications for Australia's national security.
	   ``In a conflict situation, the information they would be
gathering could affect the lives of thousands of military
personnel.''
	   Bevis called on Prime Minister John Howard's government to make
public any plans for the sell-off of other aspects of Australia's
defense systems.

Spanish judges ask Britain for permission to quiz Pinochet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Two Spanish judges on Tuesday asked British
authorities for permission to question former Chilean dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet who is currently in hospital in London, a lawyer
representing victims of the Pinochet era said.
	   Pinochet, who is recovering from surgery in the English capital,
is implicated in two separate Spanish judicial probes into human
rights violations in Chile and Argentina.
	   The judges base their request to question Pinochet on the
European Convention on Terrorism which requires signatories to aid
each others' judicial processes related to terrorism, said Juan
Garces, a lawyer involved in the Chile investigation.
	   The Spanish judges are investigating accusations against
Pinochet of genocide and international terrorism.
	   Judge Manuel Garcia Castellon opened his probe into murder,
torture and disappearances during Pinochet's 1973-1990 regime in
July 1996.
	   According to Garces, Garcia Castellon is close to winding up the
investigation and indicting the man who ousted elected Chilean
President Salvador Allende with a bloody coup 25 years ago.
	   Meanwhile, Judge Baltasar Garzon is investigating the
disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in Argentina during
the military dictatorships between 1976-83.
	   Pinochet is implicated in the Argentina probe through his
involvement in ``Operation Condor,'' a scheme to coordinate
anti-leftist campaigns by military regimes throughout Latin
America's southern cone.
	   At the weekend, Chilean officials said Pinochet was making a
positive recovery from surgery for a herniated disc in an
unidentified hospital. It was not known how long he would have to
remain in hospital.
	   Pinochet remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean army until
last March, when he was sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post
established for him by a constitution drafted by his regime.

Forest fires intensify in Israel, Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Forest fires raged for a fourth straight day in
northern and central Israel on Tuesday, temporarily closing a major
highway and forcing thousands of people from their homes.
	   Fires in the Carmel forests blazed out of control near the
northern port city of Haifa, and residents of three nearby villages
were evacuated from the area, some for the second time in two days.
	   In the Western Galilee, fire destroyed 25 acres (10 hectares) of
forest, Israel radio said.
	   In the hills near Jerusalem, fires smoldering since Monday
intensified Tuesday, sending thick clouds of smoke toward the
Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway and briefly forcing the closure of the
major thoroughfare.
	   Meanwhile, a court on Tuesday extended the arrest of three
Israeli Arab youths being held on suspicion of having set fire to
wilderness areas near Wadi Ara in northern Israel.
	   Earlier this month, Wadi Ara was the site of clashes between
Israeli Arabs and police over a land dispute.
	   Officials said most of the other fires were started accidentally
by picnickers who left coals burning in the forest while visiting
during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, which ended Monday.
Unseasonably hot, dry conditions and strong winds in the region
also helped the fires spread.
	   In Lebanon, fires have already destroyed 1,750 square kilometers
(675 square miles) of pine forest and olive and citrus groves.
	   Hundreds of firefighters, soldiers and civilians worked to
control the blazes. U.N. peacekeepers deployed north of the border
with Israel have used helicopters to drop water on the fires.
	   The blazes began this weekend in the wooded hills of Batroun in
northern Lebanon. They spread quickly to areas that were unusually
dry due to a recent heat wave.
	   Some 150 fires have been reported in areas ranging from the
outskirts of Tripoli, 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Beirut, to
villages south of the port city of Tyre, 60 miles (100 kilometers)
south of the capital.

Excerpts from Nobel Chemistry Prize citation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Nobel-Sciences

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Excerpts from the Royal Swedish Academy
of Sciences' Nobel Chemistry Prize citation.
	   The prize went to Walter Kohn, a Vienna-born American citizen
with the University of California-Santa Barbara, and John A. Pople,
a British citizen teaching at Northwestern University.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   The laureates have each made pioneering contributions in
developing methods that can be used for theoretical studies of the
properties of molecules and the chemical processes in which they
are involved ... Kohn for his development of the density-functional
theory, and Pople for his development of computational methods in
quantum chemistry.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   As we approach the end of the 1990s we are seeing the result of
of an enormous theoretical and computational development, and the
consequences are revolutionizing the whole of chemistry. Kohn and
Pople are the most prominent figures in this process.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Kohn's theoretical work has formed the basis for simplifying the
mathematics in descriptions of the bonding of atoms, a prerequisite
for many of today's calculations. Pople developed the entire
quantum-chemical mehtodology now used in various branches of
chemistry.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Kohn's density-functional theory is now used in studies of
numerous chemical problem areas, from calculating the geometrical
structure of molecules to mapping chemical reactions. Pople
realized that if theoretical methods were to gain any significance
it was necessary to know how accurate the results are in any given
case. (He) designed a computer program which at a number of
decisive points was superior to others' efforts.

Hard-line militia volunteers demonstrate against Rushdie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ About 1,000 hard-liners, many of them
militia volunteers, demonstrated outside Tehran University on
Tuesday, shouting that the religious edict against writer Salman
Rushdie remained in force.
	   The demonstration occurred as Abdollah Nouri, a deputy to
moderate President Mohammad Khatami, delivered a speech at the
university on civil liberties.
	   One of the hard-liners tried to hit Nouri as he was leaving the
campus, but four body guards protected him and whisked him away in
his car.
	   Nouri, who is a close ally of President Mohammad Khatami, was
attacked along with Ataollah Mohajerani, the minister of culture
and Islamic guidance, on Sept. 4 by militants.
	   The demonstrators called for the death of Rushdie.
	   ``The edict is irrevocable, and we emphasize the implementation
of this edict against apostate Salman Rushdie independent of any
diplomatic negotiations conducted by Iran's government,'' said a
statement distributed by the Basij Resistance Forces, a militia
that assists the army in wartime.
	   A ``fatwa,'' or religious edict, was issued by the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini against Rushdie in 1989 on grounds his
book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' was blasphemous.
	   Khatami's government has tried to distance itself from offers by
Iranian groups to pay money to anyone implementing the fatwa.
	   On Monday, a foundation that initially offered dlrs 2.5 million
to anyone who kills Rushdie raised the reward to dlrs 2.8 million.
	   Last Saturday, a hard-line student group offered its own reward
of dlrs 333,000.
	   The edict has strained ties between Iran and the West,
especially Britain. Britain restored diplomatic relations last
month after Khatami's government distanced itself from the reward
offering.
	   Rushdie, who spent nearly a decade in hiding after Khomeini
issued the edict, expressed relief that the ordeal was over.

German theater withdraws play accused of anti-Semitism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ An avant-garde theater in Berlin has
backed down on plans to perform a play Jewish leaders have
criticized as anti-Semitic, saying it would instead invite an
Israeli company to stage the piece in Germany next year.
	   An announcement in the summer by the Maxim-Gorki Theater that it
planned to stage Rainer Werner Fassbinder's ``Garbage, the City and
Death,'' drew heavy criticism from Germany's Jewish leaders. One
called the play ``Goebbels-esque,'' referring to Adolf Hitler's
propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.
	   Director Bernd Wilms said the theater decided not to stage the
play with its own company to demonstrate it took seriously the
Jewish community's protests.
	   Ignatz Bubis, chairman of Germany's Central Council of Jews,
said the decision would ``save a lot of anger.''
	   ``But I'm not jumping up and down in happiness,'' Bubis said.
	   Wilms said the heated debate over the play would make any clear
assessment of it impossible. He defended the play, saying it was
confronted anti-Semitism.
	   ``We don't read the play any differently from how we did before
and are convinced that it's neither anti-Semitic, nor could it
encourage anti-Semitism,'' Wilms said.
	   ``But we take people's fears seriously, and we don't want any
trial of strength over it.''
	   The 1975 play has only been performed once in Germany to a
private audience of journalists in Frankfurt in 1985. Condemned by
Jewish leaders, including Bubis, it was never produced again in
Germany, although it has been staged around the world, including
New York.
	   Fassbinder, better known as a director of films about postwar
Germany, said he wrote ``Garbage, the City and Death,'' because he
feared a resurgence of anti-Semitism in Germany. He died in 1982.
	   The play tells the story of a prostitute and her pimp in
Frankfurt during the 1960s and 70s, when police were clearing
squatters from buildings. One character _ a rich, Jewish, real
estate speculator who is the target of insults _ is supposedly
based on Bubis, who is also a Frankfurt businessman.
	   Israel's Yoram Loewenstein theater has been invited instead to
perform the play in Germany, Wilms said. The troupe also will stage
the play in Tel Aviv in March.

Eritrea, Yemen strengthen ties after resolution of island dispute

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Yemen said Tuesday it will appoint an
ambassador and resume flights to Eritrea now that a dispute between
the two countries over a Red Sea archipelago is resolved.
	   Economic cooperation on all fronts _ transportation, air cargo,
minerals and fisheries _ will follow, said Abdul-Kader Bajammal,
Yemen's deputy prime minister and foreign minister.
	   ``We've agreed in principle to build bridges in all fields,''
Bajammal said after he and other high-level Yemenis met with
Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki.
	   A court in The Hague ruled Friday in favor of Yemen in its
dispute with Eritrea over the Hanish Islands, a quarrel that had
threatened a major shipping route 170 kilometers (100 miles) north
of the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the southern entrance to the Red
Sea.
	   Yemen and Eritrea both claimed the three islands, one of which,
the Greater Hanish, was captured by Eritrea in a brief battle in
December 1995. Yemen retained control of the other two, Lesser
Hanish and Zuqar.
	   The tribunal awarded all three major islands to Yemen. Eritrea
promised to withdraw its troops from Greater Hanish.
	   Eritrea was awarded three minor islands and four islets.
	   Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Woldensae said peaceful solution
of the dispute will strengthen the relationship between the two
countries.
	   ``Eritrea is prepared for enhancing and improving cooperation
between the two countries,'' he said.
	   Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh on Monday told Yemen Airways
to resume flights to Asmara, Bajammal said Tuesday. Flights were
suspended in 1995.
	   Yemen also will send an ambassador to Asmara, he said. The last
one was pulled out three years ago. Eritrea was expected to
reciprocate.
	   An Eritrean delegation planned to travel to San'a, the Yemeni
capital, on Wednesday to continue discussing political and economic
cooperation.
	   Leaders on both sides said border conflicts should be resolved
through peaceful and legal means.
	   Eritrea is now embroiled in a conflict with Ethiopia over their
common boundary. Land and sea boundaries between Yemen and Saudi
Arabia also are in dispute.
	   Eritrea and Yemen decided in 1996 to have their disagreement
settled by the International Court of Arbitration, a low-profile
panel of international experts that is based in The Hague. The
court's decisions are legally binding.

Apartheid's stalwart church considers integration

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) - South Africa was poised to
take another step toward reconciliation Tuesday when the white
church that formed the religious backbone of apartheid began
considering integration with its non-white counterpart.
	   But the proposal reportedly has angered provincial branches, who
are threatening to secede from the Dutch Reformed Church to keep
their religion segregated.
	   Church officials from around the country were gathering Tuesday
for debate before a vote on the merger on Wednesday. The decision
was on the agenda of the 1998 national meeting, which occurs every
four years.
	   The Dutch Reformed Church is the main religious denomination of
Afrikaners, the Dutch-descended white settlers of South Africa.
	   During the apartheid era, when the Afrikaner-led National Party
governed the country, the church told members that white minority
rule was ordained by biblical teachings.
	   Starting in 1982, the church gradually renounced its position
but kept separate branches for blacks and mixed-race congregants.
In 1994, the black and mixed-race branches merged to become the
United Reformed Church of South Africa.
	   The white church is now considering a merger with the United
Reform Church.
	   Last month, the 164,000-member Free State provincial branch was
reported to have opposed the merger because it objected to
worshipping with blacks and people of mixed race.
	   The merger was advocated in 1994 by some church theologians, who
feared the church would be left behind by the overall social
transformation that followed 1994's first all-race vote.
	   Even before the election, other stalwart white organizations
began transforming themselves.
	   In 1993, the secret organization believed to be the power behind
apartheid _ the Afrikaner Broederbond _ opened its ranks to all
races who spoke Afrikaans, the language of the Afrikaners.
	   The assassination in 1994 of a former church head who opposed
apartheid _ Johan Heyns _ raised fears of an upswing in political
violence after the election.
	   Under Heyns' leadership from 1986 to 1990, the church declared
apartheid a sin.
	   Last year, a Dutch Reformed Church official reaffirmed its
contrition over its racist teachings.
	   ``We have indeed taught our people wrongly with regard to
apartheid as a biblical instruction,'' Dutch Reformed Church
moderator Freek Swanepoel told the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, which is working to heal country's divisions.
	   The admission was hailed by panel chairman Desmond Tutu, the
former Anglican archbishop, as a great contribution to ``the
process of healing in our land.''

Third round of peace talks begins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with talks beginning; Burundian insistance on lifting
of sanctions &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHE NKRUNZIZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The third round of talks aimed at
finding a peaceful solution to the ethnic and political conflict in
Burundi opened Tuesday with Burundi insisting that sanctions
imposed two years ago should be lifted.
	   Gen. Hashim Mbita, spokesman for former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere, who is mediating the talks, said discussion of the
sanctions did not figure on the agenda.
	   On Monday there were reports that the government of President
Pierre Buyoya was considering a walkout if sanctions imposed by
neighboring countries after Buyoya seized power in July 1996 were
not lifted.
	   ``We cannot come to negotiate without insisting that from the
moment the actual negotiations begin there can no longer be any
pretext for saying the sanctions have been imposed to oblige
Burundi to negotiate,'' said Burundian Peace Process Minister
Ambroise Niyumbasa.
	   ``We have agreed to negotiate, and these sanctions have no more
reason to exist.''
	   Sources close to Nyerere say he was not keen on lifting the
sanctions until he sees how Buyoya's government performs at the
latest round of talks.
	   Subjects on the agenda included the adoption of general rules of
negotiation and the appointment of chairmen of committees that will
discuss the issues in the Burundi conflict.
	   The failure to designate a chairman of the key peace and
security committee could possibly lock the talks, observers said.
	   Two candidates were proposed _ former Malian President Moussa
Traore, who is standing trial for corruption in Bamako, and
Nigerian Gen. Victor Mallu, who headed the West African
peace-keeping force in Liberia.
	   The Burundians rejected Mallu but did not explain why; Traore's
candidacy was not judged serious by some participants.
	   For Etienne Karatasi, head of the predominantly Hutu Palipehutu
party, the peace and security committee would play a key role in
the negotiations.
	   ``When there is security for everyone, it will be possible to
arrive at appropriate solutions to other questions,'' he said.
	   The first round of all-party talks opened in June and was
followed by another in July when a cease-fire more or less took
hold in most of the country.
	   The sanctions were imposed to force Buyoya, a retired Tutsi
military officer who had previously served as president from 1987
to 1993, to return to a constitutional regime and begin talks with
Hutu rebels.
	   Buyoya claims those conditions have been met and that the
holding of the talks in which all major political parties and rebel
groups are represented is proof.
	   At least 200,000 people died since October 1993 when Tutsi
paratroopers assassinated Burundi's first democratically elected
president, Hutu Melchior Ndadaye.
	   There were initial widespread reprisals by majority Hutus
against minority Tutsis, but because the Tutsis control the army,
they seized the upper hand and drove many Hutus out of Bujumbura,
the capital and largest city in the tiny central African nation.
	   Buyoya said he intervened in July 1996 to stanch the bloodshed
after a coalition government was unable to control the situation.

Council hears from inspectors about VX, progress on inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Top U.N. weapons inspectors briefed the
Security Council on Tuesday on stalled arms inspections in Iraq and
U.N. efforts to determine whether Iraq loaded VX nerve gas into
missile warheads.
	   Richard Butler, the executive chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission, and Mohamed ElBaradei, the director general of the
International Atomic Energy Agency, were giving council members an
overview of their six-month reports, released last week, on the
status of inspections in Iraq.
	   The reports shed little new light on what is known about Iraq's
abilities to make weapons of mass destruction. Butler repeated his
claim that Iraq was near finished disarming itself of chemical
weapons and missiles, but that questions remain about its
biological weapons capabilities.
	   He cautioned, however, that final results of tests for the
chemical nerve agent VX, expected to be discussed at a meeting here
next week of chemical weapons experts, were not yet complete.
Sampling of warheads by the commission has ``thrown significant
doubt'' on Iraq's claim that it never was able to put the deadly
gas into weapons, Butler wrote.
	   Butler was expected to answer the council's questions on the VX
issue, following reports that results from French labs had turned
up traces of the gas, U.N. officials said. Swiss tests on warheads
turned up negative. But a U.S. Army laboratory concluded that
missile fragments contained traces of VX.
	   In its report, the IAEA repeated its previous claims that over
the past six months, it found no new evidence that Iraq had tried
to restart its nuclear weapons program. The gaps that exist can be
filled in over the course of a long-term monitoring program, rather
than intrusive inspections, IAEA said.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _ and the missiles to
deliver them _ before the 15-member council will lift sanctions
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Iraq claims it has destroyed all its banned weapons and accuses
the United States of manipulating the inspection program to
maintain sanctions.
	   Iraq suspended cooperation with UNSCOM and IAEA on Aug. 5 _
paralyzing spot searches _ after Butler refused to certify that
Iraq was disarmed.
	   Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, wrapped up 10 days of
talks in New York last week, hoping to reach an agreement with the
U.N. chief over the impasse. While no deal was reached, Iraq's
official media appears to have softened its stand on resuming
cooperation.
	   For four days running, editorials in the state-run newspapers
have not included remarks critical of U.N. inspectors.
	   During Aziz's visit, editorials in the state-run newspapers
trumpeted that Iraq wouldn't yield and Vice President Tahan Yassin
Ramadan reiterated on several occasions that only lifting sanctions
will make Iraq change its mind.
	   Nevertheless, on Tuesday an estimated 25,000 women marched
through Baghdad's streets in a government-organized demonstration
to express anger at U.N. trade sanctions.
	   The women carried anti-American placards and shouted slogans
against the U.S. government. ``America is the enemy of God,'' they
screamed as they approached the offices of the U.N. Development
Program in Baghdad where the organizers handed over a letter of
protest.
	   In previous years, the council would have conducted a review of
sanctions following the October reports from UNSCOM and IAEA.
Russia, France and China _ which generally take a more sympathetic
line toward Baghdad _ were expected to have made a push to ease
sanctions, based on Iraq's progress in coming clean with its
nuclear weapons program.
	   But the council last month suspended the regular reviews of
sanctions to punish Iraq for its Aug. 5 decision.

Romanian Prime Minister says Turkey wants to buy attack helicopters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile
said Turkey is interested in buying 124 attack helicopters to be
produced by Romania and American company Bell Textron, national
radio reported Tuesday.
	   Romania earlier said that it would have to delay the deal
because it is too expensive for the ailing economy. But Turkey's
reported offer might change the outcome of the controversial
dlrs1.45 billion deal, radio reported.
	   ``There is a clear offer from Turkey to help set up the contract
between Bell Helicopter Textron and the Romanian side,'' radio
quoted Vasile as saying in Antalya, Turkey, where he is attending a
summit of Balkan leaders.
	   Romania and Bell Textron signed a preliminary contract for a 70
percent stake in Romanian helicopter-manufacturer IAR Brasov, in
1997. In July, the government agreed to guarantee a dlrs 1.45
billion loan.
	   Under the agreement, Romania is obliged to purchase 96 AH1RO
Dracula helicopters to be produced by Bell and IAR.
	   The deal, which was widely criticized in Romania, was put on
hold last week after foreign financial institutions and U.S.
government officials said it was not ``feasible'' for the economy.
	   Romania is trying to cut expenditures to trim the budget deficit
which would make itt eligible for further international loans.
	   Vasile said Turkish Defense Ministry officials are expected to
arrive in Bucharest in the next 10 days.

Russia to expand role of foreign banks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES thruout with fresh quotes from
Gerashchenko, other details. Trims. CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government may allow foreign banks to provide
retail services in Russia, in hopes that such a policy would bring
a flow of deposits from the many Russians who keep their savings at
home, officials said Tuesday.
	   Russians were just beginning to trust banks over the past year
or two, after a series of economic hits in the early 1990s and the
collapse of high-profile pyramid schemes that carried away their
savings. But that trust melted away when the majority of commercial
banks froze accounts in August or started allowing only limited
transactions as a result of the current crisis.
	   Clients of six major private banks have been advised to transfer
their accounts to the state savings bank, where they would be
guaranteed. But any savings in foreign currencies would be
converted into rubles at an unfavorable rate.
	   The situation has made most Russians keep their savings at home,
and vast amounts of dollars are believed to be stashed away under
mattresses and floorboards.
	   Allowing foreign banks into the country is likely to bring
private savings into the economy, because Russians tend to trust
them more.
	   However, the government worries that Russian banks would lose
out in competition with foreign banks and that deposits would
simply be taken out of the country through the foreign banks'
channels, said Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko.
	   ``We have to draw a line here so that foreign currency deposits
gathered by (foreign) banks, which operate in Russia, would also
stay in Russia and would not go abroad,'' Gerashchenko told a news
conference Tuesday.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told bankers Tuesday that
between dlrs 1.5 billion and dlrs 2 billion have left the country
since the crisis struck in mid-August. The Central Bank recently
gave a much higher figure.
	   Primakov said the government is considering allowing foreign
banks in the market, but provided few details.
	   ``We cannot manage without expanding opportunities for foreign
banks in Russia, without the expansion of foreign capital in assets
of Russian banks,'' he said.
	   All the major international banks have offices in Russia, but
they are devoted mostly to corporate and investment services.
	   Primakov also denied widespread speculation that the government
was planning to nationalize ailing domestic banks. Some banks will
just go under, Primakov added.
	   ``Our goal isn't to save all banks,'' he said.
	   The government hasn't spelled out its plans for pulling Russia
out of the crisis, insisting that the plan will depend on whether
the International Monetary Fund provides aid for Russia.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said if the IMF money
is not forthcoming, Russia will have to print more money, which
would likely lead to high inflation.
	   ``The talks (with the IMF) will continue, but if we are
cornered, we will have to agree to a restricted inflationary
mode,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.
	   The IMF says it wants to see details of the government's
economic plan, plus signs it has been implemented, before it will
release more money.
	   In other developments:
	   _ Russian stocks leapt higher for the second session in a row
Tuesday as bargain-hunters took advantage of weeks of decline.
Volume remained light, however, with the Russian Trading System
Index rising 6.53 percent to 47.67 points from 44.75 points Monday.
Trading volume was dlrs 1.5 million, compared with dlrs 639,738
Monday.
	   _ Gerashchenko said the government expects to reach a deal with
foreign investors by the end of the month on new terms for repaying
the treasury bills it defaulted on in August.
	   _ The government may allow Russian commercial banks to convert
their debts to foreign banks into shares, Gerashchenko said.
However, foreign banks could not acquire more than 12 percent of
all the capital in Russia's banking system.

KLA representative: deal without full autonomy ``not a solution''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Swiss-based political representative of the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army said Tuesday that any solution short
of full autonomy for the troubled Yugoslav province was
unacceptable.
	   A deal without independence for the province ``is not a
solution,'' Bardhyl Mahmuti told The Associated Press by telephone.
There was ``no possible perspective'' of the two communities living
together, he added.
	   ``There has been too much suffering, too much misery, too many
civilian victims,'' Mahmuti said.
	   ``We are very determined to continue our struggle through to
liberation if initiatives and efforts to resolve the problems
around the table fail.''
	   The KLA, which last week declared a ceasefire, has ``given a
chance'' to peace efforts and will continue to do so, Mahmuti said.
	   ``We hope that this time the international community is
serious,'' he added.
	   Mahmuti also expressed concern over the safety of members of an
unarmed verification force which will oversee compliance with the
deal to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   Under the agreement on Kosovo announced Monday, Milosevic would
guarantee the safety of the 2,000 members of the force which will
be deployed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
	   ``It's not the first time Milosevic has promised something,''
Mahmuti said. ``We'll see what happens.''
	   He said he thought Milosevic would use unarmed observers as
``hostages,'' referring to the action by Bosnian Serbs in taking
U.N. troops captive during the Bosnian war.
	   But Mahmuti said the KLA ``will take decisions as the situation
changes.''
	   ``Before we have the text of the deal, we cannot take a really
clear decision,'' he said.

Brazilian star returns to practice with Internazionale of Milan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Ronaldo practiced with his Internazionale of
Milan teammates for the first time in more than three weeks
Tuesday, but cast doubt on whether he will be in the lineup for his
club's upcoming clash against Lazio of Rome.
	   The Brazilian striker has been out of action since Sept. 20 with
tendinitis in both knees.
	   ``I have never been sidelined for this long in my entire
career,'' Ronaldo said, ``and I have a great desire to play again.
Inter needs me, but in shape. That's the most important thing.''
	   Club trainer Claudio Bordon cautioned that the player should not
rush back.
	   ``Ronaldo's condition has progressed greatly,'' Bordon told the
ANSA news agency. ``He is no longer in pain and today he worked out
at the same pace as his teammates. But we need to be sensible. He
still lacks high-intensity work and I would think first before
throwing him into action.''
	   Inter has survived Ronaldo's absence with outstanding play from
reserve striker Nicola Ventola, who was called up to Italy's
national team for the first time last week. The club has compiled a
3-1-0 record and stands second in the 18-team Serie A heading into
its game Sunday night against Lazio, a rematch of last season's
UEFA Cup final won by Inter.

O'Neill wants to talk with Leeds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEICESTER, England (AP) _ Leicester manager Martin O'Neill broke
a protracted deadlock Tuesday between his club and Premier League
rivals, Leeds, by saying he wants to open contract talks with
Leeds.
	   Leicester's board has rejected two formal approaches by Leeds to
open talks with O'Neill, forcing the former Northern Ireland
international to say he has the right to speak to other clubs.
	   ``I am quite clear that I am entitled, at the very least, to
hear what (Leeds) has to say,'' he said.
	   Leeds president Peter Ridsdale has made no secret of his plans
to sign O'Neill to takeover at Elland Road.
	   Leeds has been without a manager since George Graham switched to
Tottenham Hotspur two weeks ago.
	   O'Neill, who rejected an offer from Everton in the off-season to
stay at Leicester, said Leicester officials had broken a
``gentlemen's agreement'' by refusing to allow him to speak with
Leeds.
	   ``Others might have other interpretations, but I am clear in my
own mind that I would not be breaking my contract,'' he said.
	   ``I have kept quiet long enough. It's time for me to come out
and say what the situation is.''
	   Ridsdale reportedly wants O'Neill to take over at Leeds before
Saturday's Premier League matches kick-off.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Five scientists at universities in the
United States won the Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry Tuesday
for work exploring the inner structure of matter. Their research
has far-reaching implications, from a new generation of
microelectronics to understanding the destruction of Earth's ozone
layer.
	   Three physicists will share the prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior, work that could lead to further
advances in microelectronics.
	   And two researchers were named co-winners of the chemistry prize
for theoretical research into the quantum properties of molecules.
	   In each case, the winners will share the dlrs 978,000 prizes.
	   The chemistry award went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California-Santa Barbara and John Pople of Northwestern University.
Kohn, 75, was born in Vienna, Austria. He has taught at U.S.
institutions since 1950, and at Santa Barbara since 1979.
	   Kohn was cited for development of density-functional theory in
the 1960s. It simplifies the mathematical description of the
bonding between atoms that make up molecules.
	   His approach makes calculations according to an average number
of electrons located in any point, rather than trying to establish
the motion of each electron in every atom in a molecule. This
reliable model has enabled scientists to study large molecules that
previously were too complex and unwieldy to understand.
	   Pople, 72, is a British citizen. He joined the faculty at
Canegie-Mellon University in 1964 before relocating to Northwestern
in 1986.
	   Pople was cited for developing computer techniques to test the
chemical structure and details of matter. The resulting computer
program is used by thousands of universities and companies
worldwide. In the 1990s, he has refined the program to include
Kohn's density-functional theory.
	   His approach allows scientists to create computer models of
chemical reactions that are difficult or impossible to recreate in
the laboratory. It has a wide range of applications, from studying
interstellar matter based on telescope measurements of its chemical
signatures and how pollutants such as freon react with the ozone
layer.
	   In medicine, researchers use Pople's quantum chemistry methods
to simulate the effects of proposed drugs to fight HIV infection.
	   The laureates in physics are Robert B. Laughlin of the United
States, Horst L. Stoermer of Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a native
of China who is now an American citizen.
	   They discovered that ordinary electrons acting together in
strong magnetic fields and very low temperatures can condense into
new types of composite subatomic particles that function as a
fluid, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. Subsequently,
other researchers confirmed their experiments and directly observed
these new composites, known as quasiparticles.
	   ``Usually in physics, you break things into smaller and smaller
pieces,'' said Stoermer, who claimed he had no inkling that he
would win this year.
	   ``But here something else happens,'' he said. ``The big
electrons stay perfectly intact, yet they create smaller units that
look like electrons that have a charge that is one-third or
one-fifth or one-seventh of an electron and (yet) doesn't break
apart.''
	   Laughlin works at Stanford University, Stoermer (pronounced
STER-mer) currently is at Columbia University and Tsui (TSOO-ee)
teaches at Princeton University. The award recognizes work Tsui and
Stoermer did together in 1982. Laughlin elaborated on the work the
next year.
	   Laughlin, 47, who did his graduate studies at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, got the news in the middle of the night.
	   ``The reason why this is important is that it has to do with why
the universe is the way it is,'' he said today. ``You can chop (the
universe) to pieces or learn how all the pieces work together. This
is a triumph of the second.''
	   According to the citation, the three men discovered a new form
of ``quantum fluid'' _ fluids such as liquid helium that have
certain properties in common, such as superfluidity, or the absence
of energy resistance at ultra-low temperatures.
	   What makes these fluids important for researchers is that they
can reveal more about the inner structure and dynamics of matter.
	   It is ``yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics,'' the academy
said.
	   Mansour Shayegan, a colleague of Tsui at Princeton, said all
three ``have done wonderful work.''
	   ``They have essentially discovered a new state of condensed
matter,'' he said.
	   Mats Jonson, a physics professor at Sweden's respected Chalmers
Institute of Technology, said the laureates' work could be
important in the development of smaller electronic components and
could lead to improving computer memories by manipulating electrons
in this altered state.
	   The development of microelectronics has allowed other
researchers to confirm the work's validity in experiments the
academy likened to ``measuring the sound of individual hailstones
during a hailstorm.''
	   The trio's work built on experiments performed by German
physicist Klaus von Kiltzing, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in
1985.
	   Tsui, 59, was born in Henan, China, in 1939. He came to the
United States in 1958 to attend Augustana College in Rock Island,
Illinois. He received his doctorate in physics from the University
of Chicago and was appointed a professor at Princeton in 1982.
	   Stoermer received his doctorate in physics from Stuttgart
University. He joined Columbia this year after supervising the
Physical Research Laboratory at Bell Laboratories since 1992.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for discovering
properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but also a
life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   Their finding helped lead to the discovery of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra.
	   The literature prize was awarded Thursday to Portuguese novelist
Jose Saramago. The economics prize winner is to be named on
Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
	   All the prizes are announced in Stockholm, except for the peace
prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes
in his will.

Israeli parliament provides armed guard for leftist lawmaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ For the first time, the Israeli parliament on
Tuesday began providing a bodyguard for one of its members, a
left-wing lawmaker who has received right-wing threats and had his
car set on fire.
	   Ran Cohen sponsored a measure, which parliament passed into law,
to remove the grave of gunman Baruch Goldstein from a West Bank
settlement and rebury it in a less conspicuous place. Court
challenges have delayed its implementation.
	   Goldstein gunned down 29 Palestinians at a mosque in the West
Bank city of Hebron in 1994 and was bludgeoned to death by
surviving worshippers. Right-wing admirers have made his grave into
a shrine and a place of pilgrimage.
	   Cohen, from the leftist Meretz party, said he has received many
threats from the extreme right. Slogans were painted on the walls
of his house, leaflets were distributed on the street where he
lives and eggs were thrown at him when he addressed public
gatherings.

Mixed signals perplex Belgraders: Does this mean no bombs?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ There was some relief but no
celebration on Belgrade's streets after Slobodan Milosevic declared
Tuesday that NATO won't bomb Yugoslavia.
	   Many Serbians don't trust their president or his propaganda.
Others said they feared the Yugoslav president has made some secret
deal with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke that will in the end hurt
them more.
	   ``I don't know what Milosevic promised Holbrooke exactly. But
whatever it is, we should wait and see if he keeps his word,''
unemployed schoolteacher Dragan Petrovic said, while sipping beer
in a cafe in downtown Belgrade, the capital.
	   Many residents in the Serbian and Yugoslav capital on Tuesday
were not aware of news that Milosevic had agreed to end his
crackdown in Kosovo after marathon talks with Holbrooke.
	   State-run Serbian media didn't mention the breakthrough in the
negotiations that emerged Monday. They didn't even bother to report
that the NATO alliance on Tuesday gave Milosevic four days to
comply with international demands or face airstrikes, instead
publishing defiant Serbian reactions.
	   But at noon Tuesday, Milosevic made a rare appearance on TV to
declare the NATO strikes were averted.
	   ``Relief, that's all I feel,'' said Marko Milosavljevic, a
Belgrader in his 30s, watching in a cafe as state-run TV repeated
Milosevic's address over and over.
	   ``There will be no bombing now, that's for sure,'' he said, but
added: ``It's because I believe in Holbrooke, not Milosevic.''
	   State TV later carried reaction from unidentified people,
hailing Milosevic's statement as ``super,'' ``great'' and
``absolutely beautiful.''
	   But the difficulty in finding such emotion or strong reaction in
the streets suggested the broadcast was another example of
state-controlled media putting a pro-Milosevic spin on the story.
	   ``Fear is the dominant feeling here _ people are aware that they
have a president and a clique around him who rule by gambling with
human lives,'' psychologist Zarko Korac told the independent Nasa
Borba daily.
	   If the fear drags on for too long, it hammers individuals into
passivity, a state of numbness, Korac elaborates.
	   War rhetoric still runs high in state-owned media, lashing out
against the West, accusing it of ``the worldwide anti-Serb
conspiracy.''
	   In an editorial Tuesday, the official Borba daily blamed America
and Britain, comparing NATO threats of airstrikes to Nazi
propaganda and warmongering of the Third Reich.
	   Just for good measure, the commentary repeatedly referred to the
historic suffering of Serbs under foreign invaders.
	   ``Small and peaceful Serbia will once again be attacked ... if
they (NATO) decide they feel like,'' Borba says, adding: ``What can
we do but be ready?'

10 Iranians released by Taliban arrive in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Ten Iranians who were released by
Afghanistan's Taliban militia have returned home, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   The Iranians arrived Monday in Tehran aboard a Red Cross plane,
the agency said.
	   On Sunday, the Taliban returned the bodies of three slain
Iranian diplomats.
	   Both gestures were seen as trying to temper tensions between the
Taliban and Iran, which has massed more than 200,000 troops on its
eastern border with Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban has acknowledged that renegade militiamen killed
eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist after the Taliban captured
the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Iran had demanded the Taliban return the bodies of the Iranians
and send the killers for trial in Tehran. Six bodies were returned
earlier, but the Taliban has refused to hand over the suspected
killers.
	   Last Friday, the Taliban released five Iranians captured during
the militia's sweep of western Afghanistan.
	   More than 60 Iranians are still believed to be in Taliban
custody, including some 30 that Iran says were drivers delivering
humanitarian aid.
	   Taliban leaders, who are mostly Sunni Muslims, accuse Iran of
arming and financing Afghanistan's northern-based opposition, which
includes the country's minority Shiite Muslims. Most Iranians also
are Shiite Muslims.

Milosevic says agreement averts danger of armed attack in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ President Slobodan Milosevic said
Tuesday that his agreement on Kosovo with a special U.S. envoy had
averted ``the danger of a military intervention against our
country.''
	   In his rare television address, Milosevic referred to threats of
NATO airstrikes if he did not agree to halt the seven-month
crackdown against ethnic Albanian separatists in the southern
Kosovo province.
	   ``I want to inform you that an agreement has been reached to
solve the problems through a peaceful way and by political means,''
a somber Milosevic said. ``The agreement we reached eliminate the
danger of an armed intervention against our country.''
	   He said that despite the ``enormous pressure that we were
exposed to over the past years ... and especially in the past weeks
and days, the determination pervaded that solution can be found
only peacefully.''
	   The agreements reached are ``in accordance with the interests of
our country, with the interest of Republic of Serbia and all of its
citizens and ethnic communities.''
	   ``The political solution is aimed at the equality of all nations
in Kosovo,'' he added.
	   Milosevic then thanked all who, as he said, expressed support to
him during the talks, helping him to ``preserve the territorial
integrity and sovereignty of our country,'' and that ``problems in
the southern Serbian province be solved in a peaceful way.
	   ``I think we have achieved that. I thank you all.''

US says resolution endorsing Holbrooke agreement likely
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council will probably adopt a
resolution backing the agreement to send monitors into Kosovo to
verify Serb compliance with U.N. demands to halt the crackdown on
ethnic Albanians, the U.S. deputy ambassador said Tuesday.
	   Peter Burleigh said the 15-member council will need to look
closely at the agreement reached after marathon talks between U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
that came amid heightened threats of NATO intervention.
	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw his forces from Kosovo,
begin peace negotiations with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow
some 2,000 international observers into the troubled Kosovo
province.
	   A resolution would back Monday's agreement with the force
international law.
	   The Security Council in a Sept. 23 resolution demanded an end to
hostilities, the safe return of refugees, and a negotiated
settlement.
	   When asked if the council would want to endorse Monday's
agreement with another resolution, Burleigh said ``most probably
yes.'' He noted that the Contact Group of states, which has been
meeting regularly on Kosovo, had said last week that there would
``probably be a Security Council resolution with regard to the
verification agreement.''
	   No text of a resolution, however, has begun circulating, council
diplomats said.
	   ``The key is compliance with all of the aspects of the Security
Council resolution 1199,'' of Sept. 23, Burleigh said.
	   The Serb crackdown, launched Feb. 28, was aimed at crushing the
Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting for independence of the majority
Albanian province, which is part of the Yugoslav republic of
Serbia.
	   Hundreds have been killed in Kosovo and hundreds of thousands
more have been forced from their homes during the seven-month
operation in Kosovo, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.

Netanyahu seeks Cabinet backing for agreement with Palestinians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cabinet meeting over, group of legislators saying
they will topple Netanyahu over a West Bank troop withdrawal &QL; 
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Cabinet hardliners asked Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday to link a West Bank troop pullback to
Palestinian security guarantees, and an Israeli swimming in a
spring was shot dead in an attack blamed on Palestinian militants.
	   The shooting and the hardliners' demands came a day before
Netanyahu was to leave for Washington for meetings with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton is pushing the two to conclude an
agreement on a long-overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   Palestinian militants have carried out a series of drive-by
shootings in recent years in hopes of wrecking peace talks.
	   In Tuesday's attack, assailant fired from a pistol at two
Israeli men bathing in a spring near the communal farm of Ora west
of Jerusalem, said police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby. One man was
killed and the second critically wounded, the spokesman said. The
assailants' car was later found abandoned near the West Bank.
	   In a special eight-hour Cabinet meeting, ministers from the
National Religious Party demanded that Netanyahu not hand over any
land to the Palestinians unless they extradite suspects in attacks
on Israelis and cancel clauses in the PLO founding charter that
call for the destruction of Israel, said party spokesman Joshua
Mor-Yosef.
	   In addition, the NRP stipulated that Netanyahu not sign a
withdrawal agreement unless the scope of an additional pullback is
decided on now, Mor-Yosef said.
	   If Netanyahu wraps up a deal without meeting these conditions
the NRP will bring down the government, Mor-Yosef said. The party,
the patron of the Jewish settlement movement in the West Bank and
Gaza, has enough seats in the 120-member parliament to rob
Netanyahu of his parliamentary majority.
	   A government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Netanyahu will support the NRP's demands on security and the PLO
Charter, but will not agree to any formal Cabinet decision
restricting his power to negotiate.
	   Also Tuesday, a group of legislators from Netanyahu's coalition
known as the Land of Israel Front issued a new ultimatum, saying
they would topple the government if the prime minister agreed to a
West Bank withdrawal. The group has 11 legislators, enough to bring
down the government.

Russian railways resume mail delivery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's railways have resumed carrying mail after
the postal service promised to settle its huge debts, a government
official said Tuesday.
	   Russian railways stopped carrying most mail Sept. 20 to protest
the post office's failure to pay about 210 million rubles (dlrs 13
million) in shipping costs.
	   The stand-off between the post office and the railways stranded
hundreds of rail cars around the country stuffed with letters and
packages.
	   Delivery was resumed Thursday after the postal service promised
to pay 30 million rubles (dlrs 1.9 million) by the end of the
month, and the rest of the debt by Dec. 25, said a Railway Ministry
spokeswoman who refused to give her name.
	   Russians rely heavily on mail as their main method of
communication, especially in far-flung regions where there are few
telephones. Few Russian TV networks broadcast throughout the
country, so people also depend on newspapers delivered by mail for
news.
	   The post office, which is chronically in debt, says it is owed
money by the government and others. It refused to give any figures
on its revenues or debts.

Third round of peace talks begins

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The third round of talks aimed at
finding a peaceful solution to the ethnic and political conflict in
Burundi opened Tuesday with Burundi insisting that sanctions
imposed two years ago should be lifted.
	   Gen. Hashim Mbita, spokesman for former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere, who is mediating the talks, said discussion of the
sanctions did not figure on the agenda.
	   On Monday there were reports that the government of President
Pierre Buyoya was considering a walkout if sanctions imposed by
neighboring countries after Buyoya seized power in July 1996 were
not lifted.
	   ``We cannot come to negotiate without insisting that from the
moment the actual negotiations begin there can no longer be any
pretext for saying the sanctions have been imposed to oblige
Burundi to negotiate,'' said Burundian Peace Process Minister
Ambroise Niyumbasa.
	   ``We have agreed to negotiate, and these sanctions have no more
reason to exist.''
	   Sources close to Nyerere say he was not keen on lifting the
sanctions until he sees how Buyoya's government performs at the
latest round of talks.
	   Subjects on the agenda included the adoption of general rules of
negotiation and the appointment of chairmen of committees that will
discuss the issues in the Burundi conflict.
	   Former Malian President Amadou Toumani Toure was named to head
the key peace and security committee after the Burundian government
rejected the other candidate, Nigerian Gen. Victor Mallu, who
headed the West African peace-keeping force in Liberia.
	   For Etienne Karatasi, head of the predominantly Hutu Palipehutu
party, the peace and security committee would play a key role in
the negotiations.
	   ``When there is security for everyone, it will be possible to
arrive at appropriate solutions to other questions,'' he said.
	   The first round of all-party talks opened in June and was
followed by another in July when a cease-fire more or less took
hold in most of the country.
	   The sanctions were imposed to force Buyoya, a retired Tutsi
military officer who had previously served as president from 1987
to 1993, to return to a constitutional regime and begin talks with
Hutu rebels.
	   Buyoya claims those conditions have been met and that the
holding of the talks in which all major political parties and rebel
groups are represented is proof.
	   At least 200,000 people died since October 1993 when Tutsi
paratroopers assassinated Burundi's first democratically elected
president, Hutu Melchior Ndadaye.
	   There were initial widespread reprisals by majority Hutus
against minority Tutsis, but because the Tutsis control the army,
they seized the upper hand and drove many Hutus out of Bujumbura,
the capital and largest city in the tiny central African nation.
	   Buyoya said he intervened in July 1996 to stanch the bloodshed
after a coalition government was unable to control the situation.

Turkey: Syria apparently closes down Kurdish rebel camps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's defense minister said Tuesday it
appeared that Syria had shut down Kurdish rebel camps in territory
under its control, meeting one of Turkey's demands in a
confrontation between the two neighbors.
	   ``Our impression is that Syria has ended activities in all
terrorist camps,'' Ismet Sezgin told reporters. ``Of course, this
will be checked.''
	   Ankara claims Kurdish rebels have set up camps in the Bekaa
Valley of Lebanon, where Syria holds sway. It has demanded Syria
close them and end all support to the rebels or face unspecified
military action. Syria denies the accusations.
	   Sezgin appeared to have gotten his information from Egypt's and
Iran's foreign ministers, who have been acting as mediators in the
2-week-old crisis.
	   Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, shuttling between Damascus
and Syria, brought a proposal from Syria on Monday, Turkey said.
	   The contents of the message were not made public. Turkish
officials said they regarded it with ``positive interest.''
	   Turkey's response was the first sign of a breakthrough in the
crisis, which has sparked fears of a regional war.
	   Kurdish rebels have been fighting for autonomy in Turkey since
1984. Fighting since then has killed 37,000 people.

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ The third round of talks aimed at
finding a peaceful solution to the ethnic and political conflict in
Burundi opened Tuesday with the president insisting on the end of
sanctions imposed two years ago.
	   Gen. Hashim Mbita, spokesman for former Tanzanian President
Julius Nyerere, who is mediating the talks, said discussion of the
sanctions did not figure on the agenda.
	   On Monday, there were reports that the government of President
Pierre Buyoya was considering a walkout if sanctions imposed by
neighboring countries after Buyoya seized power in July 1996 were
not lifted.
	   ``We cannot come to negotiate without insisting that from the
moment the actual negotiations begin there can no longer be any
pretext for saying the sanctions have been imposed to oblige
Burundi to negotiate,'' said Ambroise Niyumbasa, Burundi's minister
for the peace process.
	   ``We have agreed to negotiate, and these sanctions have no more
reason to exist.''
	   Sources close to Nyerere say he was not eager to lift sanctions
until he sees how Buyoya's government performs at the latest round
of talks.
	   Former Malian President Amadou Toumani Toure was named to head
the key peace and security committee after the Burundian government
rejected the other candidate, Nigerian Gen. Victor Mallu, who
headed the West African peace-keeping force in Liberia.
	   For Etienne Karatasi, head of the predominantly Hutu Palipehutu
party, the peace and security committee would play a key role in
the negotiations.
	   ``When there is security for everyone, it will be possible to
arrive at appropriate solutions to other questions,'' he said.

Human rights activist found slain in apartment

	   CONSTANTA, Romania (AP) _ A human rights official who probed
cases of corruption in this Black Sea port was found beheaded in
his apartment on Tuesday, a police officer said.
	   Stefan Itoafa, 24, was found by his wife Tuesday morning with
his hands tied and his head cut off, ``possibly by a sword,'' said
Col. Nicolae Vasiliev, head of Constanta's criminal police.
	   Itoafa was a lawyer and head of the Constanta branch of the
Human Rights Defense League, a nationwide watchdog organization set
up after the 1989 fall of communism.
	   Sorin Calafus, also a lawyer in the city some 225 kilometers
(141 miles) east of Bucharest, said Itoafa was involved in solving
some ``flagrant cases of illegality and he therefore bothereda lot
of powerful and influential people.''
	   Police are investigating the case.

Authorities seize premises of opposition newspaper

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian police and bailiffs on Tuesday
evicted an opposition-minded daily from its Kiev premises to
enforce a court order newspaper officials called a political attack
on their paper.
	   The centrist Kievskiye Vedomosti newspaper lost a court case in
which the owner of the premises, a government-run educational
center, alleged that the paper had concluded an improper contract
and not paid its debts.
	   Bailiffs accompanied by some police officers began sealing the
rooms of Kievskiye Vedomosti early Tuesday. Newspaper employees
said the electricity and water supply to their offices was cut and
some property was seized to cover the alleged debts.
	   Mykhailo Beletsky, Vedomosti's deputy foreign editor, said the
original rental contract was slated to expire next year. He
insisted there was no reason for the offices' owners to ask for the
contract to be annulled.
	   ``This is an attempt to put pressure on an opposition newspaper
in order to stop its existence,'' Beletsky said.
	   He said it wasn't clear when the paper would resume publication,
but other newspaper representatives said it would likely appear
again later in the week after moving to another newspaper's
offices.
	   Some Ukrainian politicians and journalists complain that
President Leonid Kuchma's government is using civil suits and tax
inspections to silence opposition publications in the former Soviet
republic.
	   The government ``has managed to put the press on its knees,''
Serhiy Pravdenko of the centrist opposition Hromada movement told
parliament Tuesday.
	   Government officials say newspapers are crying persecution to
cover up their own mistakes and lack of professionalism.
	   Kuchma's foes say the supposed obstacles facing the news
organizations began to mount just before the March parliamentary
elections, in which the leftist and centrist opposition scored
significant gains.
	   Some opposition newspapers have been closed this year, while
others have lost libel suits and been unable to pay heavy fines.
	   Last June, Kievskiye Vedomosti lost two court battles over
allegations of libel against Ukrainian officials. The newspaper is
appealing both verdicts, which it said were politically motivated.
	   In a more recent case, police last month arrested the former
editor of an opposition-linked paper, Pravda Ukrainy, on suspicion
of attempted rape. Kuchma's opponents have suggested that the case
was political.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Massimo Moratti, the owner of soccer power
Internazionale of Milan, ruled himself out Tuesday as a possible
successor to Mario Pescante as president of the Italian Olympic
Committee (CONI).
	   Officials hope to find a replacement soon, particularly in light
of Turin's bid to host the 2006 Winter Games. International Olympic
Committee members will be visiting the northern city this week to
inspect proposed sites.
	   Pescante officially stepped down Tuesday, two weeks after he had
announced his resignation in the face of a widening doping scandal
that also led to the shutdown of Italy's drug-testing laboratory.
	   ``The presidency of CONI would be a difficult commitment for me
right now,'' Moratti said. ``It is an enormous responsibility which
requires a lot of time.''
	   The oil industrialist's name is one of several that have been
floated for the top job at CONI, which oversees professional and
amateur sports in Italy. Primo Nebiolo, the 75-year-old president
of the International Amateur Athletic Federation, is reportedly a
candidate.

Parliamentary committee ruled out misuse of intelligence service
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Opposition deputies walked out of the
parliamentary commission Tuesday after they were denied permission
to see intelligence reports on the alleged misuse of the military
counter-intelligence unit in political duels.
	   They were, however, outvoted by the six members of President
Franjo Tudjman's ruling party who concluded they found no grounds
to support the allegations.
	   The 10-member commission was to examine claims by the former
chief of President Franjo Tudjman's cabinet, Hrvoje Sarinic, who
charged in a recent interview that the military
counter-intelligence led a media campaign against him and other
more liberal members of Tudjman's ruling party.
	   Their actions, Sarinic said, were likely orchestrated by another
close Tudjman aide, hardliner Ivic Pasalic.
	   The commission on Monday heard Sarinic and Pasalic as well as
the head of the counter-intelligence unit, Markica Rebic.
	   The opposition members said they cannot make a judgment without
seeing reports that the two other intelligence services made after
investigating the issue. Their request was rejected by the
Tudjman's party members who said the reports are confidential.
	   The top secret reports were already showed on Saturday to
President Franjo Tudjman and dozens of members of his ruling party.
	   ``It is not permissible'' to display reports before one party
members, and not before the parliamentary deputies, said Ante Vujic
of the opposition Social Democrat.
	   In protest, the four resigned from the commission.
	   Sarinic's claims demonstrated the deep rift between him and
Pasalic, who symbolize two factions of Tudjman's Croatian
Democratic Union: moderates, who are leaning towards organizing
Croatia along western standards, and hardliners, who oppose broader
democracy.
	   But the claims also highlightened widespread suspicions that
Tudjman and some of his party members are using state bodies for
political or personal gains.

New campaign funding laws recommended to deter influence-buying
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A government-appointed committee on Tuesday
recommended a 20 million pound (dlrs 34 million) limit on spending
by political parties for national elections and compulsory
disclosure of big campaign donations to deter influence-buying in
British politics.
	   ``Many members of the public believe that the policies of the
major political parties have been influenced by large donors, while
ignorance about the sources of funding has fostered suspicion,''
committee chairman Lord Neill said.
	   The proposed limit, however, is well below the 54 million pounds
(dlrs 92 million) that the two major parties _ Labor and the
defeated Conservatives _ spent between them on campaigns for May
1997 national elections.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's government welcomed the report and
said it would put forward a bill by mid-1999 covering the main
points.
	   Charges against the Conservatives, traditionally supported by
big business, have included accepting big donations from foreigners
and, when in power, rewarding with knighthoods or peerages heads of
major companies that gave generously.
	   The Tories accuse Labor of owing favors to the trade unions,
whose 1997 donation of nearly 6.4 million pounds (dlrs 11 million)
accounted for more than one-fourth of the party's income.
	   The committee recommended a ban on any group giving more than 5
percent of a party's campaign fund total.
	   Blair was embarrassed last November when he sought to exempt
Formula One racing from a then-proposed ban on tobacco company
sponsorship. Simultaneously, news broke that Formula One boss
Bernie Ecclestone had given Labor a 1 million pound (dlrs 1.7
million) campaign donation. The party returned the money.
	   Among the other 100 recommendations by Neill's Committee on
Standards in Public Life was a ban on foreign donations; compulsory
disclosure of donations over 5,000 pounds (dlrs 8.500); tax breaks
on gifts of up to 50 pounds (dlrs 85) to encourage small donations;
and a blue-ribbon committee to investigate any links between honors
and political donations.
	   Campaign spending in Britain is small by U.S. standards because
buying TV time _ a major expense _ is banned. Instead, the two
major networks have to give each party a limited number of free
political ads.
	   Labor has long pressed for a ban on foreign donations. The
Conversatives have said the identities of foreign contributors to
their 1997 campaign will remain secret.
	   The Tories have acknowledged receiving 17 donations of more than
1 million pounds (dlrs 1.7 million) between 1992 and 1997. Among
the more embarrassing gifts was 440,000 pounds (dlrs 748,000) in
the early 1990s from Asdil Nadir, a now-fugitive Turkish Cypriot
wanted on fraud charges.
	   ``One of the real problems over the last few years under the
general heading of sleaze has been the parties have had to raise
very large sums of money, and they've done so in ways that have
often seen pretty murky,'' said Anthony King, a committee member
and professor of government at Essex University.

Pakistan's top spy agency gets new chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif appointed
a new spy chief Tuesday in the latest of a series of changes in
Pakistan's powerful military.
	   Gen. Ziauddin, who uses only one name, takes over as head of the
elite Inter-Services Intelligence agency, an army spokesman said.
	   The new appointment comes amid a string of changes in the top
ranks of the powerful military, which has ruled Pakistan for 25 of
its 51-year history. It has repeatedly thrown out civilian rulers
to take control.
	   Sharif's critics say he is trying to curb the power of the army,
but have warned that challenging the military could generate
political uncertainty.
	   Last week, lawmakers gave the federal government sweeping powers
to impose Islamic law, only days after the surprise resignation of
the army chief, Gen. Jehangir Karamat.
	   He was critical of Sharif's political and economic policies, and
before resigning had called for the creation of a
military-dominated council that would have a role in determining
government policy.
	   Two other senior generals also resigned after they were passed
over for promotion when Sharif appointed Gen. Pervaiz Mushraf as
new army chief.
	   Ziauddin comes from Sharif's hometown of Lahore, the capital of
Pakistan's powerful Punjab province, said the army spokesman, who
spoke on customary condition of anonymity. He replaces Lt. Gen
Nasim Rana.

Minister: Iraq needs thousands of tractors, harvesters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq needs thousands of tractors and
harvesters to boost its farm output, Agriculture Minister
Abdel-Ilah Hamid Saleh said Tuesday.
	   He estimated that the country needs ``several thousand''
tractors and at least 2,500 harvesters over the next five years.
	   But he also acknowledged that the continuing U.N. trade
sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, made it
difficult for the country to raise funds for the machinery.
	   The sanctions limit Iraq's sale of oil, it's economic mainstay.
They cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Iraq's agricultural market is huge and very promising for the
exporters of agricultural machines and implements,'' Saleh told The
Associated Press in an interview.
	   He spoke on the fringe of a agricultural trade exhibition that
has attracted 25 foreign firms.
	   Organizers said the Iraqis struck deals for the purchase of
equipment to be imported under the oil-for-food program.
	   The program, an exception to the sanctions, has earmarked dlrs
250 million for agriculture and irrigation projects in Iraq.
	   ``It is nothing when compared with our annual import bill of
dlrs 3 billion before the sanctions,'' Saleh noted.
	   Saleh said a five-year agricultural development plan, to be
implemented after the sanctions are lifted, calls for spending dlrs
1 billion on imports.
	   Saleh said Iraq was making ``some progress'' in boosting its
agricultural output despite the sanctions. He said the country was
self-sufficient in corn and barley but not wheat, dairy products
and poultry.
	   He did not give figures, but U.N. statistics indicate that the
country is harvesting about 1.2 million tons of wheat a year, or
about 2.8 million tons less than it needs.
	   A recent U.N. survey indicated that Iraq's livestock fell to
about 9 million head in 1997 from 16 million in 1990.

Last minute talks with Generali fail, prize to be withheld
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANN S. KIM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A last ditch effort by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office failed Tuesday to reach a compromise with
Italian insurance giant Generali Tuesday over the publication of
World War II-era policies, the premier's advisor said.
	   As a result, Israel will withdraw an award it planned to present
to Assicurazioni Generali at an international business conference
this week in Jerusalem, said Bobby Brown, Netanyahu's adviser on
Diaspora affairs.
	   The company's chairman, Antoine Bernheim, was among dozens of
international business leaders who was to receive the ``Jubilee
Award'' on Thursday for contributing to the Israeli economy.
Generali spent dlrs 320 million in 1997 to acquire a majority
position in Migdal, an Israeli insurance company.
	   ``We are quite surprised and disappointed,'' said I.A.
Ben-Porath, a lawyer for Generali in Israel who was involved in the
negotiations.
	   Generali, which reneged recently on an agreement to pay dlrs 100
million to policy holders and their heirs, has come under increased
criticism for not making public information on wartime policies.
	   Brown said Generali had offered to provide some names but not
detailed information of policy holders including maiden names,
beneficiaries and occupations, which would make it easier for heirs
to identify.
	   ``We didn't feel that was a commitment we could live with,''
Brown told The Associated Press.
	   Earlier this year, Generali provided information on war-era
policies to Israel's Holocaust memorial, but only on condition that
the information be used for the museum's research and not for
publication. The Yad Vashem museum has said from the information,
they have ascertained that Generali sold life insurance policies to
over 100,000 Jews on the eve of the Nazi Holocaust.
	   Ben-Porath said Generali has already committed to releasing
policy information to an international commission that will
investigate Holocaust insurance claims. That commission will meet
for the first time on Oct. 21 in New York.
	   But Brown said there was no guarantee that the commission would
require Generali to make a full disclosure of the details. Brown
said he would like to see the information on Generali's 337,000
war-time policies published in newspapers and the Internet.

Akin Birdal tops shortlist of candidates for Sakharov Prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The Turkish human rights campaigner
Akin Birdal on Tuesday topped a shortlist of three candidates for
the Sakharov Prize, a human rights award given each year by the
European Parliament.
	   The Parliament's foreign affairs committee gave 22 votes to
Birdal, 16 to the ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and six to
Ukshin Hoti, a political detainee of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's regime.
	   ``This most likely means Birdal will win the prize, although one
tends to be cautious until the winner is announced,'' said Tony
Robinson, spokesman for the Socialist group, the Parliament's
largest faction. The Socialists support Birdal as this year's
winner of the prize.
	   Birdal is the president of Turkey's Human Rights Foundation.
Last May he survived an assassination attempt in his country.
	   There were altogether eight individuals and organizations
nominated for this year's Sakharov Prize. Some of those who did not
make the shortlist include the Dalai Lama and Mordechai Vanunu, who
is serving an 18-year jail sentence in his country for giving away
nuclear secrets.
	   The final decision is up to Parliament President Jose Maria
Gil-Robles and the leaders of all the political groups in the
626-member assembly.
	   They must vote before the Parliament's December session in
Strasbourg, France, at which time the winner will be invited to
accept the award.
	   The prize comes with 15,000 European currency unit (dlrs
16,500).
	   Previous winners of the Sakharov prize include the South African
leader Nelson Mandela, the Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi, and Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng.

Tyson deemed 'fit' to fight again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with release of documents &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson told psychiatrists he was very
depressed the second time he fought Evander Holyfield because of
personal and financial problems and was feeling betrayed by
``people I would have died for.''
	   A report by a team of psychiatrists who examined the former
heavyweight champion portrays him as lacking in self-esteem and
depressed to the point that he has been taking anti-depressant
drugs in the months following the Holyfield fight.
	   However, the report says the former heavyweight boxing champion
is ``fit to box again.'' The report was ordered by the Nevada state
Athletic Commission as a requirement for Tyson in his attempt to
regain his license.
	   ``I have no self-esteem, but the biggest ego in the world,''
Tyson told the psychiatrists.
	   The report says Tyson felt embarrassed and humiliated by having
to undergo five days of psychological testing last month before
doctors in Boston, and was concerned that people would think he was
``psycho.''
	   It also says he has problems dealing with his status as a
celebrity.
	   ``I don't want super stardom,'' Tyson said.
	   But it says Tyson is deeply remorseful for biting Holyfield's
ears and is highly motivated not to repeat any such behavior in the
ring.
	   ``We believe that the risk of such a re-offense is low,'' the
report said.
	   The report recommends that Tyson undergo psychotherapy and that
his problems with depression and self-esteem can be treated without
any further medication.
	   It concludes by saying there is no way to predict future
behavior, but the doctors believe Tyson is fit to box again.
	   ``It is the opinion of the evaluation team that Mr. Tyson is
mentally fit to return to boxing, to comply with the rules and
regulations, and to do so without repetition of June 28, 1997,''
the report said.
	   ``While we take note of the impulsivity, emotional problems and
cognitive problems outlined above, it is our opinion that none of
these, alone or in combination, render Mr. Tyson mentally unfit in
this regard.''
	   The report was released publicly Tuesday and was given to the
panel, charged with licensing boxers in the western American state
of Nevada, just minutes before a late Monday deadline.
	   A team of six doctors who examined Tyson last month at
Massachusetts General Hospital wrote the report, which was ordered
by the commission to evaluate Tyson's application to box again. The
examiners included a neuropsychologist, psychiatrist, clinical
psychologist, two neurologists and a doctor-lawyer.
	   The commission will meet Monday to determine whether to
relicense Tyson. If Tyson is denied a license, he will have to wait
another year to be able to return to the ring.
	   Tyson's lawyer, Jim Jimmerson, earlier described the reports as
positive and said show that Tyson is mentally and physically able
to fight. He acknowledged, though, that they contain things Tyson
would rather not be seen.
	   ``It is a hard-hitting report,'' Jimmerson said. ``There are
going to be things that talk about his innermost thoughts and
innermost feelings.''
	   Tyson issued a statement saying he didn't want to release the
reports but that his main goal is getting back into the ring.
	   ``On numerous occasions I have apologized for my actions in the
ring vs. Evander Holyfield,'' Tyson said. ``I am willing to do
whatever the Nevada Athletic Commission wants me to do in order to
regain my license to fight.''
	   The commissioners asked for the psychiatric reports after a
six-hour licensing hearing decided nothing last month.
	   At issue at Monday's hearing will not only be Tyson's
psychological records, but questions about a traffic altercation he
was involved in Aug. 31.
	   ``It will be a very interesting hearing,'' predicted Marc
Ratner, the commission's executive director.
	   Jimmerson was upbeat about the reports as he personally
delivered them to the commission offices, despite having spent the
last two weeks trying to keep them secret.
	   ``He is sound mentally, he is sound physically, and he is sound
neurologically,'' Jimmerson said.

Five scientists working in the United States get Nobels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to ADD comment, RAISE potential implications
of winners' work. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC;

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Five scientists at universities in the
United States won the Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry Tuesday
for work exploring the inner structure of matter.
	   Their research has far-reaching implications, from a new
generation of microelectronics to understanding the destruction of
Earth's ozone layer.
	   Three physicists will share the prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior, work that could lead to further
advances in microelectronics.
	   And two researchers were named co-winners of the chemistry prize
for theoretical research into the quantum properties of molecules.
	   In each case, the winners will share the 7.6-million-kronor
(dlrs 978,000) prizes.
	   The chemistry award went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California-Santa Barbara and John Pople of Northwestern University.
Kohn, 75, was born in Vienna, Austria. He has taught at U.S.
institutions since 1950, and at Santa Barbara since 1979.
	   Kohn was cited for development of density-functional theory in
the 1960s. It simplifies the mathematical description of the
bonding between atoms that make up molecules.
	   His approach makes calculations according to an average number
of electrons located in any point, rather than trying to establish
the motion of each electron in every atom in a molecule. This
reliable model has enabled scientists to study large molecules that
previously were too complex and unwieldy to understand.
	   Pople, 72, is a British citizen. He joined the faculty at
Canegie-Mellon University in 1964 before relocating to Northwestern
in 1986.
	   Pople was cited for developing computer techniques to test the
chemical structure and details of matter. The resulting computer
program is used by thousands of universities and companies
worldwide. In the 1990s, he has refined the program to include
Kohn's density-functional theory.
	   His approach allows scientists to create computer models of
chemical reactions that are difficult or impossible to recreate in
the laboratory. It has a wide range of applications, from studying
interstellar matter based on telescope measurements of its chemical
signatures and how pollutants such as freon react with the ozone
layer.
	   In medicine, researchers use Pople's quantum chemistry methods
to simulate the effects of proposed drugs to fight HIV infection.
	   The laureates in physics are Robert B. Laughlin of the United
States, Horst L. Stoermer of Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a native
of China who is now an American citizen.
	   They discovered that ordinary electrons acting together in
strong magnetic fields and very low temperatures can condense into
new types of composite subatomic particles that function as a
fluid, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. Subsequently,
other researchers confirmed their experiments and directly observed
these new composites, known as quasiparticles.
	   ``Usually in physics, you break things into smaller and smaller
pieces,'' said Stoermer. ''But here ... the big electrons stay
perfectly intact, yet they create smaller units that look like
electrons that have a charge that is one-third or one-fifth or
one-seventh of an electron and (yet) doesn't break apart.''
	   Laughlin works at Stanford University, Stoermer is at Columbia
University and Tsui teaches at Princeton University. The award
recognizes work Tsui and Stoermer did together in 1982. Laughlin
elaborated on the work the next year.
	   Laughlin, 47, who did his graduate studies at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, got the news in the middle of the night.
	   ``The reason why this is important is that it has to do with why
the universe is the way it is,'' he said today. ``You can chop (the
universe) to pieces or learn how all the pieces work together. This
is a triumph of the second.''
	   According to the citation, the three men discovered a new form
of ``quantum fluid'' _ fluids such as liquid helium that have
certain properties in common, such as superfluidity, or the absence
of energy resistance at ultra-low temperatures.
	   What makes these fluids important for researchers is that they
can reveal more about the inner structure and dynamics of matter.
	   It is ``yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics,'' the academy
said.
	   Mats Jonson, a physics professor at Sweden's respected Chalmers
Institute of Technology, said the laureates' work could be
important in the development of smaller electronic components and
could lead to improving computer memories by manipulating electrons
in this altered state.
	   The development of microelectronics has allowed other
researchers to confirm the work's validity in experiments the
academy likened to ``measuring the sound of individual hailstones
during a hailstorm.''
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for discovering
properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but also a
life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   Their finding helped lead to the discovery of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra.
	   The literature prize was awarded Thursday to Portuguese novelist
Jose Saramago. The economics prize winner is to be named on
Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
	   All the prizes are announced in Stockholm, except for the peace
prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes
in his will.

U.S. ambassador: Ex-defense minister sought military reforms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ U.S. Ambassador to Croatia William Dale
Montgomery said Tuesday ``it was clear'' that the Croatian defense
minister, who resigned suddenly on Monday, wanted to reorganize the
Croatian army along NATO standards to make it suitable for the
Partnership for Peace program.
	   The ambassador declined further comment on the unexpected
resignation of Defense Minister AndrijaHebrang.
	   Hebrang said his decision was prompted by President Franjo
Tudjman's rejection of his attempts to replace two of his
associates. The two are considered hard-liners who oppose any
reform that would give the military less power and make its affairs
more transparent to the public.
	   Hebrang's resignation raised fears that the hard-liners were
taking full control of the military, which could then further
diminish Croatia's chances to join western institutions.
	   Montgomery said Partnership for Peace requires the army to have
``a transparent budget process (and) civilian control of the
military.''
	   ``In conversations with Mr. Hebrang, and from his public
statements, it was clear he also stated that these were his
objectives,'' Montgomery told reporters.
	   He said the United States expected Croatia ``to have achieved
this by now,'' but added nevertheless that the offer for Croatia to
join the program by fulfilling its conditions still stands.

Explosion at illegal fireworks plant destroys two blocks in Mexico
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ An illegal fireworks factory exploded Tuesday
in central Mexico, carving a crater into a residential area and
flattening two entire blocks. At least 45 people were injured, and
15 more were trapped under the rubble, news media reported.
	   There were no immediate reports of deaths in the explosion in
Tultepec, 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Mexico City, according
television and radio reports.
	   The Televisa television network, which broadcast images of the
devastation, said at least 45 people were injured and that rescuers
were searching for at least 15 more.
	   A crater indicated the place where the explosion occurred, and
all of the houses in a two-block area were reduced to rubble.
Houses on surrounding blocks were damaged as well.
	   The radio station Formato 21 said authorities were concerned
about another illegal fireworks plant only 800 meters (1/2-mile)
away that has a large amount of gunpowder stockpiled inside, and
were working to make sure that didn't explode as well.
	   Tultepec is known for its fireworks, and many residents produce
them illegally in their homes. In June 1997, an explosion at one
home killed three people.

Russia to send parliamentary delegation to Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Contact Group to meet this week in graf 6,
comments from Foreign Ministry official in graf 5. Trims. &QL; 
 &UR; By LESLIE SHEPHERD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Foreign Ministry welcomed the apparent
breakthrough in the Kosovo crisis on Tuesday, while the Defense
Ministry said Russia would give Yugoslavia military help if NATO
went ahead with airstrikes.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said Russia would
probably take part in an international observation force put
together by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
	   ``It is now time to work out and coordinate the mandate'' of the
force, Rakhmanin said, welcoming an agreement mediated by U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   The agreement at least temporarily averts NATO airstrikes and
calls for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his
forces from Kosovo, begin peace negotiations and allow the
international observers into the troubled province.
	   ``A turning point has been reached. It makes no sense to discuss
the use of force now,'' a top Foreign Ministry official, Vladimir
Chizhov, was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   The six-nation Contact Group will meet later this week to
discuss further steps to bring peace in Kosovo, Chizhov said.
	   But the Defense Ministry nevertheless issued a statement warning
``Russia will provide military and military-technical aid to
Yugoslavia,'' Interfax reported.
	   The ministry also warned that if there were airstrikes, Russia
would be unlikely to ratify the START II nuclear arms reduction
treaty with the United States and will have ``to look for possible
(new) military allies to preserve the military balance.''
	   The statement said Russia would also likely respond by revising
its relationship with NATO, including its participation in the
Partnership for Peace program.
	   Responding to threats from the Russian military to break the
arms embargo against Yugoslavia, President Boris Yeltsin's
spokesman said it was up to the Russian leader to make foreign
policy. Yeltsin is at home sick this week, recovering from a
respiratory infection.
	   Russia opposes NATO airstrikes against Serbia, which makes up
most of present-day Yugoslavia. Russia and Serbia are allies, both
being Slavic countries that practice the Orthodox Christian
religion.
	   Meanwhile, the Russian parliament voted Tuesday to send a
delegation to Kosovo. The four-member delegation will leave
Thursday to study the situation in Kosovo and visit ``a number of
sites'' that NATO was likely to target, said Sergei Baburin, the
deputy speaker of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament,
who will lead the expedition.
	   Russia's Movement for Support of the Armed Forces, a political
group formed to push for Yeltsin's ouster, said it was ready to
send its members to Yugoslavia to organize resistance to NATO. It
also hinted at acts of resistance in Russia itself.
	   ``In view of the growing anti-NATO and anti-American mood in
Russia, it is impossible to guarantee that no hostile acts will be
carried out against diplomats and other representatives of NATO
member states working in Moscow,'' said Viktor Ilyukhin, who leads
the movement as well as parliament's security committee.

Infant's death of exposure signifies refugees' mounting woes

<TEXT>
	   LANIST, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The world outcry to settle the Kosovo
conflict and avert disaster for thousands of refugees camped in the
open helped produce a diplomatic settlement in Belgrade.
	   But it came too late to help an ethnic Albanian infant who died
of exposure Tuesday.
	   On a cold, rain-washed morning in a green valley near the
village of Lanist, Besart Buqa's life ended after only five weeks _
five difficult, miserable weeks with only plastic sheets to keep
out the elements.
	   Besart died of the cold about 6 a.m. Tuesday, his parents said.
He had spent his entire, brief existence as a refugee from the Serb
forces that drove his family from their home in nearby Budakovo.
	   His mother, Gjyle, and father, Zeke, only stared solemnly as the
women of the family washed the baby in Muslim tradition. The child
was then wrapped in a tiny bundle and taken by the men to a small
hole dug just outside the refugee encampment and buried.
	   The Buqas live with only minimal shelter in one of three small
encampments up a little valley washed by a cold stream. While the
inside of their plastic hut seems dry, it's very cold. There is no
way to transfer the warmth from the fire outside to the interior of
the plastic huts that dot the hillsides of this tormented province.
	   It was this growing cold that claimed Besart's life, and as
winter approaches no doubt will claim others.
	   The child's parents seemed to be in shock, staring emotionlessly
into the middle distance. Only the grandmother wailed at the fate
of her grandchild, the only sign of emotion in the small knot of
people.
	   The family is afraid to return to their village. Now, the
elements have reduced their number.

	   BATAM, Indonesia (AP) _ After an unusual, one-on-one chat
Tuesday night, the Philippine and Indonesian presidents were
considering staying away from an Asia-Pacific summit in Malaysia to
protest the treatment of their jailed friend Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Both presidents have hinted they might not attend the meeting of
the 18 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation nations next month in the
Malaysian capital out of concern for Anwar. The former deputy prime
minister and finance minister of Malaysia was arrested Sept. 20 on
corruption and illegal sex charges, then brought to court with a
black eye and bruises.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada told business and political
leaders in Singapore on Tuesday that he had not made up his mind.
Estrada called Anwar his friend and said, ``I think all of us here
believe that due process and human rights should be respected.''
	   Indonesian President B.J. Habibie may also stay away, his
foreign minister, Ali Alatas, said after the two new Southeast
Asian leaders held a half-hour private meeting.
	   If Habibie passes up APEC, Alatas said, it will be because ``he
has difficulty leaving the country while there is no vice
president, while there are so many problems to deal with.''
	   Habibie has already canceled a state visit to Malaysia, citing
difficulties at home.
	   The meeting was delayed for almost 90 minutes when a mechanical
fault was discovered in one of two Indonesian helicopters that were
to have flown Estrada and his entourage through heavy rain from
Singapore. A ferry was chartered for the 45-minute sea journey.
	   Habibie apologized when Estrada finally arrived at the Melia
Panorama Hotel.
	   Estrada replied, ``That's all right.''
	   The two men, who have each been in power less than five months,
met alois June 30 inaugural speech to give the underclass
a fairer share of the country's wealth.
	   Habibie took office May 21, hours after his predecessor and
mentor, Suharto, was forced from power after national protests and
street riots over Indonesia's collapsing economy.

Market regulators file complaint against Italy's Telecom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's stock market regulators said Tuesday they
had filed a complaint against Telecom Italia SpA over a recent
incident in which Telecom released, denied and then confirmed
company financial projections.
	   Telecom executives met Tuesday to discuss what action to take
over the incident, Italy's AGI news agency reported.
	   The telecommunications company recently gave labor unions a
three-year plan containing its financial forecasts. When a news
agency published the figures, Telecom initially refuted them, then
confirmed them.
	   The incident brought down Telecom share prices and triggered an
internal investigation and speculation of a shakeup at top levels.
	   Italy's stock market regulatory commission said Telecom has four
weeks to explain. If it isn't satisfied, the government could then
impose of a fine of up to about dlrs 120,000, the commission said.

English, Spanish, German coaches under pressure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The championship is still two years off, but
already three coaches are under pressure as 22 qualifying matches
kick off Wednesday in Euro 2000.
	   England coach Glenn Hoddle plus new Spanish and German bosses _
Jose Antonio Camacho and Erich Ribbeck _ will be watched closely in
games in Luxembourg, Israel and Moldova.
	   Just four days after an embarrassing scoreless tie with Bulgaria
at Wembley, Hoddle must win. Fortunately for him, almost nobody
ever loses to Luxembourg.
	   Ribbeck, stunned in his debut Saturday when the '96 champions
lost 1-0 in Turkey, faces a weak opponent in Moldova but
expectations are always high in Germany.
	   And that also goes for Spain, where Camacho takes over for
Javier Clemente, who resigned after a 3-2 loss in Cyprus last month
_ and that came on the heels of a miserable World Cup.
	   In other key matches Wednesday, some will focus on Turkey vs.
Finland, with Turkey atop Group 3, and Croatia vs. Macedonia.
Croatia, World Cup semifinalists, will be attempting to unseat
Macedonia from the No. 1 spot in Group 8.
	   While Luxembourg authorities brace for an onslaught of
often-troublesome English fans, Hoddle is trying to survive.
	   ``We have let ourselves down over these last two matches against
Sweden (2-1 loss) and Bulgaria, but we have got to address that _
and we can start by winning tomorrow,'' he said Tuesday.
	   Injuries and the team's poor play mean the return of David
Beckham for his first international since he was red-carded against
Argentina, a game England lost to exit the World Cup.
	   Spain has been preparing for eight days for its match against
Israel with the critical Spanish media pinpointing lightly regarded
Israel _ undefeated in two years at home _ as a real threat.
	   ``This is a like a final for us,'' forward Raul Gonzalez said.
``Clemente is history.''
	   Teammate Luis Enrique Martinez was just as straightforward. ``We
have to win so that we can be a little calmer about the future,''
	   Since taking over last month, Camacho has been credited with
raising team morale. He now faces his first official game after
notching up a 1-0 victory in a friendly against Russia.
	   In Germany, a draw will not be enough at Moldova.
	   ``A victory is our obligation, nothing else would satisfy us,''
Ribbeck said
	   ``We have to turn up the pressure, we have to win the ball, and
I'd like to feel more of a desire to win,'' he said.
	   Turkey is striving for its third consecutive victory in the
qualifiers when it takes on Finland in Istanbul, after defeating
Northern Ireland 3-0 and scoring a 1-0 win over Germany on
Saturday.
	   Turkish coach Mustafa Denizli said his team held the advantage
after Finland's loss to Northern Ireland in Belfast.
	   ``But we are not underestimating anything,'' Denizli said.
	   The cross-border rivalry between Hungary and Romania will be
heightened as Romania aims for its first win over its traditional
rivals.
	   The two countries have not met since a World Cup qualifier in
1981 and, despite Hungary's dominant record of 11 wins and four
draws in 15 head-to-heads, Romania is the new power and favored in
Budapest over the struggling Hungarians.
	   Hungarian coach Bertalan Bicskei is patching together a side in
the wake of injuries to key players following a 4-0 win over
Azerbaijan.
	   Romania and Slovakia top Group 7 with six points in two games,
while Hungary and Portugal have three points from two games.
Azerbaijan and Liechtenstein have no points.
	   Following a 4-1 victory against Malta over the weekend, Croatia
is determined to collect all three points against Macedonia.
	   The Croats were surprise losers to Ireland in Dublin in their
opening qualifier but got back on track against Malta. Coach
Miroslav Blazevic said Macedonia would be a tougher hurdle than
Malta.
	   ``They're better, faster and uncompromising. Still, I don't
believe they'll go home undefeated,'' Blazevic said.
	   In another match, France plays its first game at home since
winning the World Cup when it takes on Andorra _ European soccer's
newest national team _ in Paris.
	   France, which scored a 3-2 win over Russia on Saturday, will
take a near full-strength team into the match. After a
disappointing 1-1 draw in Iceland in its opening qualifier, new
coach Roger Lemerre's team showed its resolve with its first ever
win in Moscow.

Sanctioned states lined up to speak on lifting Cuba embargo

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Several countries under U.N. or U.S.
sanctions or both have signed up to speak Wednesday at the General
Assembly's seventh straight non-binding vote to urge an end to the
U.S. embargo on Cuba.
	   The Cuba-sponsored resolution is expected to pass with a large
margin, as it has in past years.
	   Iraq, Libya, Myanmar and Cuba itself _ represented by Foreign
Minister Roberto Robaina _ are on the speakers' list, as well as
countries such as Vietnam, which were once under U.S. sanctions.
	   Austria is also expected to address the 185-member assembly on
behalf of the European Union, which has criticized the nearly
4-decade-old U.S. embargo and 1996 U.S. legislation that tightened
it by punishing foreign companies that invest in property
confiscated from Americans after the 1959 revolution.
	   European nations believe the law violates World Trade
Organization rules governing international trade and infringes on
their sovereignty.
	   Last year, 143 U.N. member states voted in favor of the
resolution which calls for the United States to lift the embargo.
Seventeen states abstained. Only Israel and the former Soviet
republic of Uzbekistan voted with the United States against the
resolution, which is non-binding, unlike those passed by the
Security Council.
	   In 1996, a similar resolution was approved 137-3 with 25
abstentions.
	   U.N. sanctions have barred Iraq from selling its most crucial
commodity, oil, on the open market since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   U.N. sanctions that forbid air travel to and from Libya were
imposed to force the country to turn over two suspects accused in
the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
	   The United States imposed economic and trade sanctions against
Myanmar in April 1997, to punish it for its repression of democracy
activists and alleged failure to curb heroin trafficking.

Egyptian court dismisses case against peace group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A court on Tuesday dismissed a case by a
lawyer seeking to shut down the first Egyptian peace group that
aims at improving ties with Israelis, police said.
	   The court said that Mamdouh Nakhla, the lawyer who filed the
case, had no direct interest in the issue and that his petition to
the court was therefore invalid, police said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Nakhla had argued that Egyptian law does not allow groups set up
as associations to promote political issues.
	   The Cairo Peace Movement, which was launched by a group of
Egyptian intellectuals in April, works to promote peace with
Israel.
	   The group has about 120 members, including journalists, lawyers
and former diplomats. The group is critical of the government of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which it says has been blocking
efforts to achieve peace.
	   Egypt in 1979 became the first Arab state to sign a peace
agreement with Israel.
	   Relations, however, have been cool.
	   Until recently, Egyptians couldn't travel to Israel except with
a special permit. There has been a virtual boycott in Egyptian
media of Israeli officials.

	   ORA, Israel (AP) _ In a shooting attack blamed on Palestinian
militants, an Israeli man was killed and a second critically
wounded as they swam in a spring near Jerusalem on Tuesday.
	   Two assailants fired pistol shots at the bathers from close
range and then escaped in the car of the dead man, said Jerusalem
police chief Yair Yitzhaki.
	   The car was later found abandoned a short distance away, close
to an army roadblock on the border between Israel and the West
Bank. Yitzhaki said the assailants apparently fled on foot into
Palestinian-controlled territory.
	   The attack came two days before the Israeli and Palestinian
leaders were to meet in Washington in hopes of concluding an
agreement on a West Bank troop pullback.
	   In the past, Palestinian militant groups have carried out a
number of shooting and bombing attacks on Israelis in hopes of
wrecking Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
	   The shooting occurred near Ora, a cooperative farm southwest of
Jerusalem, near the West Bank. The body of the dead man, covered by
a blanket, lay on a rocky slope near the spring. The second man was
taken in critical condition to nearby Hadassah Hospital.
	   Jerusalem police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby said in a statement
that a group of Jewish Israelis later stoned Arab-owned cars
driving near Ora. Four cars were badly damaged, and the drivers,
fearing growing violence, fled the area, he said.
	   Israel radio said a curfew was imposed on the Palestinian
village of Walajeh, which is close to where the getaway car was
found, Israel radio said.
	   Police and soldiers aided by a helicopter searched the area.

Kosovo tops agenda as future coalition partners meet with their
</HEADLINE>
parties &QL; 
 &UR; By COLLEEN BARRY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Leaders of the environmentalist Greens
party on Tuesday warned against interpreting any Greens' votes
against German participation in threatened NATO strikes against
Yugoslavia as trouble for the future coalition.
	   The likely junior partner in a new government led by
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder officially supports Germany's
role in any NATO strikes, but is urging its members to vote their
conscience when parliament votes Friday.
	   Greens spokesman Juergen Trittin said lawmakers will have to
weigh the necessity of punishing Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic against the lack of a clear U.N. mandate for military
action.
	   ``I don't think there will be any unified vote among the
parliamentary factions representing the future government,''
Trittin said.
	   With Schroeder's approval, Helmut Kohl's outgoing Cabinet on
Monday approved deployment of 14 Tornado jet fighters to
participate in threatened air strikes against Yugoslavia, if
necessary.
	   Milosevic signaled agreement Tuesday to terms avoiding air
strikes _ including armed monitors and aerial surveillance of
compliance. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said the western allies'
united position _ including the Cabinet's decision to send German
soldiers _ was key to winning the agreement.
	   As an additional signal, Ruehe on Tuesday ordered eight Tornado
fighters based in Germany to Italy, where they will carry out
normal exercises and be available should Milosevic fail to keep up
terms of the deal. The German jets would be key to any NATO action,
taking out sophisticated Yugoslav air defenses.
	   Milosevic has four days to comply, a deadline that expires the
same day the outgoing German parliament meets in special session to
vote on deploying German fighters.
	   Even if Greens lawmakers vote against the deployment,
parliamentary approval seems assured because both major parties,
the Social Democrats and Kohl's Christian Democrats, largely
support committing German troops.
	   Germany's role in any air strikes has been in question since the
left's Sept. 27 election victory. And the decision to have the
sitting government to act allows the future governing partners to
skirt a potentially divisive issue.
	   Schroeder has emphasized that no matter how Greens lawmakers in
the outgoing government vote, ``there are absolutely no doubts
about the Greens' reliability in foreign policy.''
	   Both parties, he said, have agreed on continuity in foreign
policy, including a commitment to NATO that the Greens have
rejected in the past.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy on Tuesday proclaimed a
breakthrough in efforts to end the Kosovo crisis. But with NATO
planes still poised to strike, he warned President Slobodan
Milosevic must prove his commitment to peace.
	   ``We are not out of the emergency yet,'' said Richard Holbrooke
after wrapping up week-long talks with Milosevic. ``We hope that
this will mark a turning point ... but the truth is not in what I
am saying here today, the truth is in compliance.''
	   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO officials said the threat of
airstrikes remained in place to pressure the Yugoslav leader to
honor international demands on Kosovo. They said the strikes could
be called off or activated any time after Friday, the deadline for
Milosevic's compliance.
	   Threatened by airstrikes, Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw
his forces from Kosovo, begin peace negotiations with separatist
ethnic Albanians and allow some 2,000 international observers into
the troubled Serb province.
	   If honored, the commitments should end a seven-month crackdown
against Kosovo Albanian militants in the southern Serbian province
which killed hundreds _ most of them civilians _ and left up to
300,000 others displaced.
	   In a rare televised address, the first since the 1995 Dayton
Agreements that ended the Bosnian war, Milosevic sought to portray
the agreements as a victory, saying they ``avert the danger of a
military intervention against our country.''
	   ``The agreements ... are entirely in accordance with the
interests of our country,'' he added, citing ``enormous pressures
that we have been exposed to.''
	   Since the crackdown began Feb. 28, Milosevic has insisted the
crisis was an internal matter in which foreign powers should play
no role. The crackdown was aimed at the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army fighting to wrest Kosovo away from Serbia. But the collateral
damage, death and destruction affecting civilians _ led to growing
international concern that culminated in the NATO threat.
	   Milosevic said in his statement that the international
verification mission, to be led by the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, ``will eliminate false, untrue and
malicious reports about the situation in Kosovo.''
	   The OSCE mission is in fact expected to act as a brake to
further bloodshed and pressure authorities to honor Milosevic's
commitments.
	   Tuesday's developments capped a dramatic series of developments
which moved from diplomatic pressure to NATO officially moving to
the verge of airstrikes and U.S. President Bill Clinton announcing
key concessions by Milosevic.
	   International leaders stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis
because of fears that thousands of homeless refugees would die if
they could not return to their homes by the time winter sets in.
	   But for some Kosovo refugees it might be too late.
	   Besart Buqa died Tuesday in Kosovo, only five weeks old, after
spending the entire life of five miserable weeks as a refugee,
living under plastic sheets and make-up tents. His mother and
father say they were too afraid of Serb forces to return home in
Budakovo, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   In the Kosovo capital, Pristina, the political representative of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, Adem Demaci, said he was disappointed
that the verification forces in Kosovo would be unarmed. And in
Geneva, Switzerland, other KLA representatives said nothing short
of independence was acceptable.
	   Another ethnic Albanian politician, Fehmi Agani, welcomed the
agreement, but warned ``there should be no illusions that the
problem is solved.'' Agani is an aide to Ibrahim Rugova, the Kosovo
Albanian leader supported by the United States and its allies in
his search for a non-violent solution to the Kosovo crisis.
	   Holbrooke said most important was to give a boost to the
``political process that gives the people of Kosovo autonomy,
self-determination,'' under a still to be agreed on timetable.
	   Holbrooke said the key to the accord was Milosevic's decision to
allow a 2,000-member ``verification mission'' and to permit aerial
verification by non-combat aircraft that could begin as soon as the
end of the week.
	   Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, head of the OSCE,
will soon come to Yugoslavia to sign the mission agreement. NATO's
commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, and Secretary-General Javier Solana
will also arrive to sign the aerial mission.
	   ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' Holbrooke said. ``They
are compliance verifiers.''
	   In addition, political negotiations with the ethnic Albanians
will continue in Kosovo, led by Christopher Hill, the U.S.
ambassador to Macedonia.
	   The ethnic Albanians, who form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2
million-strong population, have insisted on independence rather
than regaining the autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989.
	   But international leaders oppose Kosovo independence, fearing
that could lead to further instability in the tense Balkans.
	   In Brussels, NATO sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Milosevic must take four steps: withdraw special troops from
Kosovo immediately, sign an agreement with the OSCE on the
verification mission, sign an agreement with NATO on the airborne
reconnaissance and hammer out a ``framework agreement'' by November
outlining future talks with ethnic Albanians.

Ukrainian parliament fails to bring down Cabinet

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's parliamentary opposition was
unable to muster enough votes Tuesday to force through a
no-confidence motion and bring down President Leonid Kuchma's
government.
	   Parliament voted 203-108, with 66 abstentions, to express
no-confidence in the government over its handling of Ukraine's
growing economic crisis.
	   That fell just short of the 226 votes needed for the motion to
pass in the 450-seat Verkhovna Rada. A second attempt late Tuesday
yielded even fewer votes in favor of the government's resignation.
	   The parliament's vote defied appeals from Kuchma, who has
insisted that such an action would only ``aggravate the situation
in the country'' and hurt the battered economy.
	   Parliament is ``not prepared to assume responsibility'' for
leading the nation out of the crisis, Kuchma said.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko attacked
his leftist foes for heating up political disputes as the economy
worsens. He said the parliament had failed to adopt measures to
battle the crisis and urged it to work jointly with the government
rather than ``call it on the carpet every month.''
	   But Communist leader Petro Symonenko nevertheless insisted on
the no-confidence vote.
	   ``We are convinced that the government should be made to resign
and the course should be changed,'' Symonenko told parliament.
	   Ukraine, a former Soviet republic of 50 million people, has
suffered badly from the economic crisis in neighboring Russia.
Inflation has soared, causing foreign investors to withdraw from
Ukraine's shaky financial market. The national hryvna currency has
lost 71 percent of its value so far this year, according to
Pustovoitenko.
	   The government also has heavy domestic and foreign debts,
industrial output is falling and budget revenues remain billions of
dollars off target because of the inability to collect taxes.
	   Pustovoitenko said the government planned to support selected
industries, stimulate banking activities and investments and amend
the complex tax system that has discouraged some foreign investors
from coming to Ukraine.
	   Pustovoitenko also promised to support private businesses and
focus more on privatization, which has stalled in recent months. He
called on parliament to approve Cabinet's anti-crisis plan and its
draft 1999 budget.

Van Roost profits from Kournikova's failing serve to advance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Will be UPDATED with later matches &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Anna Kournikova served up a massive
17 double-faults Tuesday, handing eighth-seed Dominique Van Roost a
straight-sets victory in the first round of the European
Championships.
	   Becoming the first Belgian women ever to enter the world's
top-10 rankings on Monday, an assertive Van Roost needed just 56
minutes to dispatch the faltering Russian 6-3, 6-1.
	   ``It makes a huge difference when you know you've entered the
top-10 and you've beaten some really great players,'' said Van
Roost, who ousted former world No. 1 Martina Hingis in the
quarterfinals at Filderstadt last week.
	   ``It made a huge difference on my side and on the other side
because she knew it, too.''
	   Van Roost showed only a momentary lapse in the first set,
allowing Kournikova to break and go up 3-2. But the Belgian
displayed the same determination which allowed her to defeat
Hingis, winning the next four games to take the set.
	   Stuggling with her service game, the 17-year-old Russian labored
in the second set to retain her opening serve, before losing her
next three and literally handing Van Roost the win.
	   ``I think she was more nervous and under pressure,'' said Van
Roost. ``She's probably the most famous player at the moment, even
more than Martina.
	   ``With people around her all the time, being in every newspaper,
being the the star, she has to win a tournament. She needs to prove
she's deserving of her status.''
	   Van Roost was quick to acknowledge Kournikova had talent and
predicted the Russian would be back in the top-10 before long.
	   The Russian, who fell out of the top-10 after tearing ligaments
in her right thumb in a fall in Eastbourne, is currently ranked
12th in the world. She has not lost to anyone ranked outside the
world's top-15 since the start of 1997.
	   ``I was a bit nervous but I'm not feeling pressure from
anybody,'' denied Kournikova, who regularly looked over at her
coach Pavel Slozil after losing a point. ``I was just getting
uptight as the match went on.
	   ``I just need to get back to where I was before I was injured.''
	   Sixth-seed Amanda Coetzer advanced to the second round with a
7-5, 6-4 win over Natascha Zvereva of Belarus.
	   The two traded serves twice in the first before Coetzer won the
last three games to clinch the set.
	   In the second set, the two players again traded sets early, but
Coetzer once again prevailed when she took Zvereva's serve at 5-4
to wrap up the match.
	   American Lisa Raymond, who reached the semifinals last year
after upsetting Hingis in the quarterfinals, advanced to the second
round Wednesday with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over lucky-loser Catalina
Cristea of Romania.

Rios powers through first-round match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Third-ranked Marcelo Rios of Chile needed only
47 minutes to rout Canada's Sebastien Lareau, 6-2, 6-0 Tuesday,
advancing to the second round of the dlrs 700,000 Singapore Open.
	   Rios used his serve to win 21 of 27 first-serve points, acing
Lareau four times.
	   The beleaguered Canadian faced 13 break points from Rios, who
broke serve twice in the first set and three times in the final
set.
	   ``I couldn't ask for a better first round,'' Rios said.
	   Jan-Michael Gambill, a 21-year-old American and the tournament's
fourth seed, also enjoyed a comfortable victory in preliminary
action.
	   He beat compatriot Jonathan Stark, who triumphed here in 1996
but has suffered from a series of injuries this year, 6-1, 6-2.
	   Two seeded players were eliminated Tuesday, the second day of
preliminary round action.
	   Seventh-seeded Dutchman Paul Harhuuis crumbled after winning the
first set, ousted by Denmark's Kenneth Carlsen 0-6, 6-3, 6-4.
	   Paraguay's Ramon Delgado, the tournament's eighth seed, was
upset by Justin Gimelstob of the United States 6-4, 6-4.
	   In doubles, top-ranked Australians Todd Woodbridge and Mark
Woodforde survived against U.S. duo and Davis Cup teammates Jim
Courier and Gambill.
	   After struggling through the first set and losing the second,
the Australians eventually overcame their wild card opponents,
winning 6-4, 5-7, 6-1.

Police clash with strikers in Colombia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Police turned water cannons on workers
hurling rocks and bottles Tuesday as a nearly week-old strike by
tens of thousands of public employees turned violent.
	   The clash outside the headquarters of the state phone company
Telecom occurred when some employees who refused to join the
walkout were escorted past picket lines in armored police cars.
	   Tensions also flared in Barrancabermeja, an oil refining city
165 miles (265 kilometers) north of Bogota, where state oil workers
tore down a barbed-wire barrier and scuffled with army troops
guarding the national refinery.
	   No injuries were reported in either confrontation _ the first
violent ones in the walkout that began Oct. 7.
	   Air traffic controllers joined the action Tuesday, causing
delays of up to four hours at some airports.
	   The walkout has curtailed phone services, canceled school for
millions of students, shut down courts, limited hospitals to
emergency services.
	   Negotiations seeking a settlement for the 650,000 affected state
employees were suspended early Tuesday, and union leaders said
thousands of strikers from around the country would converge on the
capital Wednesday and paralyze the city to increase pressure on the
government.
	   The workers object to a government austerity package that aims
to cut spending and reduce wage increases next year to an average
of 14 percent. Union leaders are insisting on salary increases at
least in line with Colombia's 18 percent inflation, and an end to
plans to privatize state industries.
	   The government, which has declared the strike illegal and
threatened to dock workers' pay, says conceding to union demands
would mean doubling the public deficit.

	   TULTEPEC, Mexico (AP) _ An illegal fireworks factory exploded
Tuesday in central Mexico, carving a crater into a residential area
and flattening two blocks. Officials said two people died and at
least 23 were injured.
	   The Televisa television network reported at least 45 people were
injured and that 15 others were trapped under the rubble in
Tultepec, 20 miles (30 kilometers) north of Mexico City.
	   But police commander Faustino Hernandez in the Mexico state
capital of Toluca said two people were killed and 23 injured. He
didn't know whether anyone was trapped in the rubble.
	   The differing casualty counts could not immediately be
reconciled.
	   In Tultepec, a crater indicated the place where the explosion
occurred, and all the houses in a two-block area were reduced to
rubble. Streets were covered in shattered glass blocks away.
	   Neighbors blocked rescuers and journalists trying to get near
the site of the explosion. Angry crowds said a gas tank had
exploded, but the smell of gunpowder was strong and television
images taken from a helicopter showed nearby piles of gunpowder.
	   Residents picked through roofing and wooden slats in an apparent
search for survivors.
	   Tultepec is known for its fireworks, and many residents produce
them illegally in their homes. In June 1997, an explosion in one
home killed three people.

Moldavian Airlines banned from Czech airports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The Czech government on Tuesday
temporarily banned all flights by the Moldavian Airlines to the
Czech Republic, officials said.
	   Spokeswoman of the Czech Airports Authority Vlasta Pallova said
that the ban becomes effective immediately and will be revoked only
after guarantees are given that the airline will not bring
passengers here without valid travel documents.
	   Pallova said the Transport Ministry issued the ban at the
request of the director of the Czech Airports, Milos Stastny.
	   The ban comes one day after more than 100 illegal refugees
arrived in Prague aboard a Moldavian Airlines plane.
	   The refugees, who had 31 children among them, reportedly paid
dlrs 5,000 per adult and dlrs 2,500 per child to unspecified
organizers just to get to Prague.
	   After Czech authorities refused to allow them into transit, the
passengers forced a 7-year old child out of the plane in protest.
	   The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said that the refugees also
ransacked the plane that will need substantial repairs before it is
able to return to Moldova's capital Kishinev.
	   All passengers were then escorted out of the plane and were
offered a place in a refugee camp.
	   Initial reports said the refugees were from Afghanistan, but the
news agency CTK on Tuesday quoted spokesman of the Moldavian
government Stefan Culea as saying from Kishinev that they were
Moldavian citizens.
	   The next flight of the airline which has three regular flights
to Prague each week was to arrive here on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Pakistan traded bitter words
and gunfire across their disputed Kashmir border on Tuesday,
injuring or killing eight Pakistani soldiers ahead of the first
peace talks between the two nations in more than a year.
	   As top Indian and Pakistani officials prepared to resume peace
talks on Thursday, India claimed Pakistani soldiers started
shelling on the border Monday evening, Press Trust of India
reported.
	   PTI said quoting defense sources ``hundreds of shells'' had been
fired by Pakistani soldiers and several Pakistani detachments were
destroyed when the Indians retaliated.
	   Pakistani soldiers patrolling on horseback at the Himalayan
territory of Siachen fell under a hail of Indian gunfire late
Monday, which Brig. Gen. Arun Chopra said was in retaliation for
earlier fire. He spoke by telephone from Srinagar, capital of the
troubled northern Jammu-Kashmir province.
	   Tension ahead of this week's talks _ the first in more than a
year _ increased Tuesday when India announced it would conduct two
weeks of military maneuvers in the Thar desert bordering Pakistan
at the end of the month. Pakistan was informed of the planned
exercise, and ``these can't be called unusual or large-scale,''
said spokesman Swagat Ghosh.
	   But in Islamabad, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tariq Altaf told
reporters India had spoiled the atmosphere on the eve of talks by
announcing the exercises. Pakistan is ``extremely disturbed,
particularly at the size and timing of the exercise,'' he said.
	   The Indian military maneuvers will be the biggest since 1987,
when the two countries came to the brink of a fourth confrontation.
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since they gained
independence from their colonial British rulers in 1947.
	   International pressure mounted on the two neighbors to talk
after May nuclear tests that led to worldwide condemnation and
economic sanctions. In the following weeks, clashes along the
border killed more than 120 people.
	   The two estranged neighbors agreed in September to resume talks
after Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif met his Indian
counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee in New York. Talks broke down last
year when Pakistan insisted that Kashmir should be a priority
issue.
	   The talks will continue until Sunday, and then resume in New
Delhi Nov. 5-13 with discussions on drug trafficking, terrorism and
cultural ties.
	   On the agenda at the Islamabad talks are the disputed state of
Kashmir and security concerns after both nations conducted
underground nuclear tests in May.
	   A senior Indian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Tuesday that New Delhi would focus on Pakistan's alleged
patronage of the nine-year Muslim insurgency in Kashmir. More than
6,000 infiltrators, who India says are mostly militants armed by
Pakistan, crossed into Indian territory last year, he said.

<TEXT>
	   LANIST, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The world outcry to settle the Kosovo
conflict and avert disaster for thousands of refugees camped in the
open helped produce a diplomatic settlement in Belgrade.
	   But it came too late to help an ethnic Albanian infant who died
Tuesday of exposure.
	   On a cold, rain-washed morning in a green valley near the
village of Lanist, Besart Buqa's life ended after only five weeks _
five difficult, miserable weeks with only plastic sheets to keep
out the elements.
	   Besart died of the cold Tuesday morning, his parents said. He
had spent his entire, brief existence as a refugee from the Serb
forces that drove his family from their home in nearby Budakovo.
	   His mother, Gjyle, and father, Zeke, only stared solemnly as the
women of the family washed the baby in Muslim tradition. The child
was then wrapped in a tiny bundle and taken by the men to a small
hole dug just outside the refugee encampment and buried.
	   The Buqas live with only minimal shelter in one of three small
encampments up a little valley washed by a cold stream. While the
inside of their plastic hut seems dry, it's very cold. There is no
way to transfer the warmth from the fire outside to the interior of
the plastic huts that dot the hillsides of this tormented province.
	   It was this growing cold that claimed Besart's life, and as
winter approaches no doubt will claim others.
	   The child's parents seemed to be in shock, staring emotionlessly
into the middle distance. Only the grandmother wailed at the fate
of her grandchild, the only sign of emotion in the small knot of
people.
	   The family is afraid to return to their village. Now, the
elements have reduced their number.

Red Army marches smartly at Dior
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SUZY PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ China's Red Army never looked more glamorous than
marching to the beat of John Galliano's spring ready-to-wear
clothes for the house of Dior Tuesday.
	   The show was a solid hit, in spite of the odd background theme.
	   What were all these Mao caps and collars, these green-and-red
military-inspired outfits doing gracing the venerable salons?
Proving you can really make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, no
doubt.
	   The rooms were done up for 500 journalists and exclusive
clientele in dream themes from ``attic'' to a ``lost boy's
bedroom.'' Celebrities in the audience included Gwyneth Paltrow.
	   Galliano, the imaginative genius, came up with some gorgeous
clothes from the severe Mao styles, unlike the jazzy mishmash of
his latest collections.
	   Leading with a visored hat in grass-khaki green with a ribbed
tank T-shirt over ballooning harem pants, saucily open at the wide
waist, Galliano showed inspiration and talent.
	   ``He did great things tastefully with that Red Army theme,''
said Kalman Ruttenstein, creative director of Bloomingdale's. There
were luxury large green cargo pants with grosgrain-bordered patch
pockets, and beautifully fitted jackets in various soft wools or
lacquered knits. Stars and red piping came out on some of the
diagonally-fastened Chinese jackets.
	   Striped extra-long pants could look good at a party matched with
one of the pleated polyester-silk tunics dripping with red beads at
the hems. Black or red armbands turned into decor here, as did
epaulets, becoming tabs to hitch up sleeves.
	   Most jackets were worn over nothing, looking quite sexy, and
featured revealing flesh-colored voile.
	   Little green or ochre fitted ottoman silk suits with
lampshade-flared skirts to below the knee looked like a fine
tribute to the older Dior ``New Look'' of the Forties.
	   Things were at their most chic for evenings in bias-cut dresses
with big red-white-and-black chevron stripes, recalling, to some,
the handsome gusset-flared skirts of the Thirties.
	   At one point a few ``wood nymphs'' capered out in plain little
ivory silk sheaths, bare legs and feet and blond manes _ another
touch of Galliano whimsy that looked winning in this collection.
	   ``I liked it a lot, maybe some of the fitted suits or large
pants,'' said Natty Belmondo, the wife of film star Jean-Paul,
dressed in a fringed pale blue suit from the last Dior collection.
	   Things were considerably less peppy at Dries Van Noten's
collection, shown in the Wagram Dance Hall strangely done up with
dark, dead trees.
	   But the wood nymphs here looked rather sweet in their camisoles
and pants, their white-and-black cotton sleeveless vest-blouses and
rumpled skirts with tucks or gathers, or sheer layered fabrics with
hazy ivy-leaf prints.
	   Australian Collette Dinnegan took her favorite nightie and
boudoir themes and came up with more softly girlish looks.
	   The red flowered dresses, skirts and two-piece bathing suits
look new here. And her latest knit suits with lingerie embroidery,
some come-hither tulle and lacy clothes will appeal to those who
want a touch of a midsummer night's dream.

NATO airstrike threat remains, despite breakthrough in talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh quotes from NATO secretary general, British
foreign secretary &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO said Tuesday its threat of
airstrikes against Serbia remained in place despite the
breakthrough in peace talks between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Alliance officials said the threat to launch strikes as early as
this weekend would stay to keep the pressure on Milosevic as
finishing touches were made to a deal to defuse the Kosovo crisis.
	   ``It is important that we do not led down our guard
prematurely,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told reporters
after talks at NATO headquarters.
	   However, NATO officials, said the alliance could at any time
decide to lift the threat or extend the deadline for airstrikes
which is due to run out Saturday morning.
	   ``We do not want to use force. But that force may be needed if
the implementation on the ground ... does not happen,'' said NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana.
	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw his forces from Kosovo,
begin peace negotiations with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow
some 2,000 international observers into the troubled Serb province.
	   Holbrooke proclaimed a breakthrough in efforts to end the Kosovo
crisis, but warned ``we're not out of the emergency yet.'' He said
it's up to Milosevic's government to prove its commitment to
honoring international demands.
	   Officials at NATO headquarters said Milosevic must take four
steps:
	   _ immediately withdraw special troops from Kosovo.
	   _ sign an agreement with the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe which will send 2,000 international observers
to Kosovo.
	   _ sign an agreement to allow NATO planes to overfly Kosovo for
reconnaissance and back up the OSCE mission.
	   _ hammer out a ``framework agreement'' by early November
outlining future talks with the Kosovo Albanians.
	   The agreements with the OSCE and NATO are expected to be signed
within days, NATO officials said.
	   ``Today is not the end of a process, it is the beginning,''
Solana told reporters. He added the monitoring mission would
initially be set up for one year, but could be extended for another
year if either side requests.
	   NATO's 16 member nations completed their airstrike plan against
Yugoslavia in the early hours of Tuesday morning by approving an
``activation order'' that formally placed hundreds of allied
warplanes under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander Wesley
K. Clark.
	   The order was the last military step NATO had to take before
actual airstrikes, but NATO gave Milosevic a breathing space of
four days to agree a deal on Kosovo.
	   In New York, U.S. President Bill Clinton warned that any
backtracking would still bring swift NATO air strikes.
	   ``Commitments are not compliance,'' Clinton said in a statement
he read Monday night after a campaign fund-raising event. ``Balkan
graveyards are filled with President Milosevic's broken promises.''
	   NATO briefed Russian envoys on the deal. Russia has strongly
opposed NATO airstrikes, but backs the idea of OSCE monitors.
	   In contrast with recent tension, a NATO official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the latest meeting with the Russians
was ``constructive and harmonious.''

on the continent.
	   The primary mission of the 54-nation OSCE, whose membership has
been expanded to include some Asian republics of the former Soviet
Union, is to serve as a ``primary instrument for early warning,
conflict prevention, crisis management and post-conflict
rehabilitation in Europe.''
	   The 54-nation OSCE, headquartered in Vienna, Austria, was set up
following a conference of European countries, the United States and
Canada that produced the Helsinki Final Act in 1975 _ a key
document signed by western and Communist countries.
	   The agreement, considered a landmark in efforts to ease Cold War
tensions in Europe, established basic principles on government
behavior toward their citizens and each other.
	   It also set up a system of international monitoring of human and
democratic rights in the Soviet bloc, which contributed to the
collapse of communist rule in Eastern Europe.
	   Ambassadors from the United States and other member states meet
regularly in Vienna to discuss regional issues and to review member
states' compliance with principles of the 1975 conference.
	   At a summit of signatory powers in Budapest, Hungary in 1994,
the group's name was changed from the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in an effort to project it as a
lasting institution.
	   While critics cite the OSCE's lack of political clout in
preventing regional wars or other conflicts, the organization has
played a key role in monitoring and even organizing elections in
former Communist countries, including Bosnia.
	   In Bosnia, the OSCE has supervised the reduction of arms under
an agreement signed by the former warring parties.
	   In Kosovo, some 2,000 OSCE monitors are to supervise
implementation of measures for the pacification of the wartorn
province under an agreement reached by U.S. mediator Richard
Holbrooke with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.

Two Kiev residents find rare pistol arsenal in garbage dump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Two Kiev residents searching a garbage dump
found an arsenal of more than 20 pistols and revolvers, including
some rare late 19th- and early 20th-century weapons, newspapers
reported Tuesday.
	   The two, a 25-year-old man and his uncle, were looking for scrap
pieces of non-ferrous metals which they could later sell, the
papers Fakty and Segodnya reported.
	   They stumbled on two briefcases containing 22 firearms _
including some modern-day weapons ready to be used _ as well as a
signal pistol and ammunition, the report said.
	   Police were examining the firearms for possible links to crimes,
but they were working mostly on the theory that the weapons were
part of an arms collection that has ended up in the garbage, a
district police chief in Kiev, Pavlo Zhurbenko, told Segodnya.

New campaign funding laws recommended to deter influence-buying
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 4th graf with two grafs to UPDATE with Conservatives also
welcoming report, self-imposed ban on foreign donations; SUBS
14th-15th grafs to CLARIFY amount of foreign donations &QL; 
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A government-appointed committee on Tuesday
recommended a 20 million pound (dlrs 34 million) limit on spending
by political parties for national elections and compulsory
disclosure of big campaign donations to deter influence-buying in
British politics.
	   ``Many members of the public believe that the policies of the
major political parties have been influenced by large donors, while
ignorance about the sources of funding has fostered suspicion,''
committee chairman Lord Neill said.
	   The proposed limit, however, is well below the 54 million pounds
(dlrs 92 million) that the two major parties _ Labor and the
defeated Conservatives _ spent between them on campaigns for May
1997 national elections.
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair's government welcomed the report and
said it would put forward a bill by mid-1999 covering the main
points, and the Conservatives also approved.
	   ``It is exactly in line with the way we have been changing the
Conservative Party,'' said leader William Hague, who banned foreign
donations after taking over following the election defeat.
	   Charges against the Conservatives, traditionally supported by
big business, have included accepting big donations from foreigners
and, when in power, rewarding with knighthoods or peerages heads of
major companies that gave generously.
	   The Tories accuse Labor of owing favors to the trade unions,
whose 1997 donation of nearly 6.4 million pounds (dlrs 11 million)
accounted for more than one-fourth of the party's income.
	   The committee recommended a ban on any group giving more than 5
percent of a party's campaign fund total.
	   Blair was embarrassed last November when he sought to exempt
Formula One racing from a then-proposed ban on tobacco company
sponsorship. Simultaneously, news broke that Formula One boss
Bernie Ecclestone had given Labor a 1 million pound (dlrs 1.7
million) campaign donation. The party returned the money.
	   Among the 100 recommendations by Neill's Committee on Standards
in Public Life was a ban on foreign donations; compulsory
disclosure of donations over 5,000 pounds (dlrs 8.500); tax breaks
on gifts of up to 50 pounds (dlrs 85) to encourage small donations;
and a blue-ribbon committee to investigate any links between honors
and political donations.
	   Campaign spending in Britain is small by U.S. standards because
buying TV time _ a major expense _ is banned. Instead, the two
major networks have to give each party a limited number of free
political ads.
	   Labor has long pressed for a ban on foreign donations.
	   The committee report showed the Conservatives acknowledged
receiving more than 16 million pounds (dlrs 27 million) from
foreigners between 1992 and 1997, though the party says the
identities of foreign contributors will remain secret.
	   Among the more embarrassing Tory gifts was 440,000 pounds (dlrs
748,000) in the early 1990s from Asdil Nadir, a now-fugitive
Turkish Cypriot wanted on fraud charges.
	   ``One of the real problems over the last few years under the
general heading of sleaze has been the parties have had to raise
very large sums of money, and they've done so in ways that have
often seen pretty murky,'' said Anthony King, a committee member
and professor of government at Essex University.

KLA representative: deal without full autonomy ``not a solution''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Swiss-based political representative of the
rebel Kosovo Liberation Army said Tuesday that any solution short
of full autonomy for the troubled Serbian province was
unacceptable.
	   A deal without independence for the province ``is not a
solution,'' Bardhyl Mahmuti told The Associated Press by telephone.
There was no possibility for ethnic Albanian majority to live
alongside Serbs, he added.
	   ``There has been too much suffering, too much misery, too many
civilian victims,'' Mahmuti said.
	   ``We are very determined to continue our struggle through to
liberation if initiatives and efforts to resolve the problems
around the table fail.''
	   The separatist KLA, which last week declared a cease-fire, has
``given a chance'' to peace efforts and will continue to do so,
Mahmuti said.
	   ``We hope that this time the international community is
serious,'' he added.
	   Mahmuti also expressed concern over the safety of members of an
unarmed verification force which will oversee compliance with the
deal to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   Under the agreement on Kosovo announced Monday, Milosevic would
guarantee the safety of the 2,000 members of the force which will
be deployed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
	   ``It's not the first time Milosevic has promised something,''
Mahmuti said. ``We'll see what happens.''
	   He said he thought Milosevic would use unarmed observers as
``hostages,'' referring to the action by Bosnian Serbs in taking
U.N. troops captive during the Bosnian war.
	   But Mahmuti said the KLA ``will take decisions as the situation
changes.''
	   ``Before we have the text of the deal, we cannot take a really
clear decision,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   TULTEPEC, Mexico (AP) _ A pile of gunpowder used to make illegal
fireworks exploded Tuesday just north of Mexico City, flattening
two blocks and killing at least four people. A paramedic said he
counted 14 bodies and that 45 people were injured.
	   State police spokesman Agustin Trujillo said at least four
people died in the explosion in Tultepec, 20 miles (32 kilometers)
north of Mexico City.
	   But a paramedic at the scene, who spoke on customary condition
of anonymity, said he had counted 14 bodies, and that at least 45
people were injured.
	   The differing casualty counts could not immediately be
reconciled.
	   In Tultepec, a crater indicated the place where the explosion
occurred, and all the houses in a two-block area were reduced to
rubble. Streets were covered in shattered glass blocks away.
	   Neighbors blocked rescuers and journalists trying to get near
the site of the explosion. Angry crowds said a gas tank had
exploded, but the smell of gunpowder was strong and television
images taken from a helicopter showed nearby piles of gunpowder.
	   Residents picked through roofing and wooden slats in an apparent
search for survivors.
	   Tultepec is known for its fireworks, and many residents produce
them illegally in their homes. In June 1997, an explosion in one
home killed three people.

Van Roost profits from Kournikova's failing serve to advance
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Will be UPDATED with later matches. &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Anna Kournikova double-faulted 17
times Tuesday and handed eighth-seed Dominique Van Roost a 6-3, 6-1
victory in the first round of the European Championships.
	   Becoming the first Belgian women ever to enter the top 10 of the
WTA Tour rankings, an assertive Van Roost needed just 56 minutes to
dispatch the Russian.
	   ``It makes a huge difference when you know you've entered the
top 10 and you've beaten some really great players,'' said Van
Roost, who ousted the formerly top-ranked Martina Hingis in the
quarterfinals at Filderstadt last week.
	   ``It made a huge difference on my side and on the other side
because she knew it, too,'' Van Roost said.
	   Van Roost showed only a momentary lapse in the first set,
allowing Kournikova to break and go up 3-2. But the Belgian won the
next four games to take the set.
	   Stuggling with her serve, the 17-year-old Russian labored to win
the first game of the second set before losing her next three and
literally handing Van Roost the victory.
	   ``I think she was more nervous and under pressure,'' Van Roost
said. ``She's probably the most famous player at the moment, even
more than Martina.
	   ``With people around her all the time, being in every newspaper,
being the the star, she has to win a tournament. She needs to prove
she's deserving of her status.''
	   Van Roost was quick to acknowledge Kournikova had talent and
predicted the Russian would be back in the top 10 before long.
	   The Russian, who fell out of the top 10 after tearing ligaments
in her right thumb in a fall in Eastbourne, has falledn to 12th.
She has not lost to anyone ranked lower than 15th since the start
of 1997.
	   ``I was a bit nervous but I'm not feeling pressure from
anybody,'' said Kournikova, who regularly looked over at her coach
Pavel Slozil after losing a point. ``I was just getting uptight as
the match went on.
	   ``I just need to get back to where I was before I was injured.''
	   Sixth-seed Amanda Coetzer advanced to the second round with a
7-5, 6-4 victory over Natascha Zvereva of Belarus.
	   The two traded serves twice in the first before Coetzer won the
last three games to clinch the set.
	   In the second set, the two players again traded sets early, but
Coetzer once again prevailed when she broke Zvereva at 5-4 to wrap
up the match.
	   American Lisa Raymond, who reached the semifinals last year
after upsetting Hingis in the quarterfinals, advanced to the second
round Wednesday with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over lucky-loser Catalina
Cristea of Romania.

NATO airstrike threat remains, despite breakthrough in talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with fresh quotes from NATO secretary general, British
foreign secretary &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BRU101,105 &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO said Tuesday its threat of
airstrikes against Serbia remained in place despite the
breakthrough in peace talks between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Alliance officials said the threat to launch strikes as early as
this weekend would stay to keep the pressure on Milosevic as
finishing touches were made to a deal to defuse the Kosovo crisis.
	   ``It is important that we do not led down our guard
prematurely,'' British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told reporters
after talks at NATO headquarters.
	   However, NATO officials, said the alliance could at any time
decide to lift the threat or extend the deadline for airstrikes
which is due to run out Saturday morning.
	   ``We do not want to use force. But that force may be needed if
the implementation on the ground ... does not happen,'' said NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana.
	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw his forces from Kosovo,
begin peace negotiations with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow
some 2,000 international observers into the troubled Serb province.
	   Holbrooke proclaimed a breakthrough in efforts to end the Kosovo
crisis, but warned ``we're not out of the emergency yet.'' He said
it's up to Milosevic's government to prove its commitment to
honoring international demands.
	   Officials at NATO headquarters said Milosevic must take four
steps:
	   _ Immediately withdraw special troops from Kosovo.
	   _ Sign an agreement with the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe which will send 2,000 international observers
to Kosovo.
	   _ Sign an agreement to allow NATO planes to fly over Kosovo for
reconnaissance and back up the OSCE mission.
	   _ Hammer out a ``framework agreement'' by early November
outlining future talks with the Kosovo Albanians.
	   The agreements with the OSCE and NATO are expected to be signed
within days, NATO officials said.
	   ``Today is not the end of a process, it is the beginning,''
Solana told reporters. He added the monitoring mission would
initially be set up for one year, but could be extended for another
year if either side requests.
	   NATO's 16 member nations completed their airstrike plan against
Yugoslavia in the early hours of Tuesday morning by approving an
``activation order'' that formally placed hundreds of allied
warplanes under the command of the Supreme Allied Commander Wesley
K. Clark.
	   The order was the last military step NATO had to take before
actual airstrikes, but NATO gave Milosevic a breathing space of
four days to agree a deal on Kosovo.
	   In New York, U.S. President Bill Clinton warned that any
backtracking would still bring swift NATO air strikes.
	   ``Commitments are not compliance,'' Clinton said in a statement
he read Monday night after a campaign fund-raising event. ``Balkan
graveyards are filled with President Milosevic's broken promises.''
	   NATO briefed Russian envoys on the deal. Russia has strongly
opposed NATO airstrikes, but backs the idea of OSCE monitors.
	   In contrast with recent tension, a NATO official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the latest meeting with the Russians
was ``constructive and harmonious.''

AMs. Rwandans play key role in Congo rebellion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINDU, Congo (AP) _ Despite repeated denials from both Congolese
rebels and the Rwandan government, Rwandan troops and officers are
playing a key role in the two-month rebellion to oust President
Laurent Kabila.
	   Rwanda has sent arms, uniforms, food, medical equipment and at
least 200 men to bolster rebel forces two days after they took the
strategic Congo River town of Kindu.
	   Rwandan army officers and soldiers are running the airlift of
supplies and troops at the rear base at Kalima, 66 kilometers (40
miles) northeast of Kindu.
	   On Tuesday, thousands of Kinyarwanda-speaking soldiers and
officers, most of them Tutsis from eastern Congo and Rwanda,
collected rifles, mortars and ammunition boxes left behind by
government troops when they fled Kindu.
	   Rwandan and Ugandan troops are beefing up rebel forces in
eastern Congo, but their involvement has also ruined any immediate
prospects for a negotiated settlement.
	   Kabila refuses to negotiate with the rebels, accusing them of
being puppets Rwanda and Uganda.
	   ``We have some officers from Rwanda,'' said rebel commander Maj.
Siatilo Ngizo, formerly of the Congolese Army. ``As you know, we
are supported by Rwanda and Uganda. Rwandan officers on the ground
liaise between us and (the Rwandan capital) Kigali.''
	   But Ngizo, who is not a Tutsi, insisted that most of the
Kinyarwanda-speaking soldiers were ethnic Tutsis from eastern
Congo.
	   Ambiguity about whether Tutsi rebels were from the former Zaire
or Rwanda dominated the eight-month 1996-97 rebellion that ousted
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and put Kabila in power.
	   Rwanda initially claimed the rebels were from across the border,
then a year later, admitted to have played the leading role in the
rebellion.
	   On Aug. 2, Congolese soldiers around the country rebeled against
Kabila after he ordered Rwandan troops who helped him seize power
two years ago to leave the country.
	   But the Rwandan soldiers, estimated to number in the thousands,
never left Congo. They just moved east, still under the command of
Col. James Kabare, a Rwandan who served as Kabila's interim army
chief of staff.
	   From Goma on the Rwandan border, they launched a daring but
unsuccessful assault on the capital, Kinshasa, in mid-August.
Rwandan officers and pilots flew Rwandan troops and ammunition from
Goma to military bases west of Kinshasa.
	   ``We're working together but not receiving or issuing orders
from each other,'' said another rebel commander, Fino Kabangu
Kalunga. ``The Rwandans are also here to protect their weapons.''
	   These include 60mm and 80mm caliber mortars used in the attack
on Kindu, according to a Rwandan officer, who requested anonimity.
	   The arsenal on display at the Kindu air base also included
rocket-propelled grenades, Kalashnikov assault rifles and
Israeli-made R-4 machine guns equipped with anti-tank missiles.
	   Rwanda and Uganda say they have legitimate security interests in
eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border
area of rebels who attack Rwanda and Uganda.
	   Many Rwandans fighting in Congo blame the late 19th century
scramble for Africa for the region's present problems. Borders
drawn up by European colonial powers often split people of the same
ethnic groups.
	   Relations between Rwandan army officers and their Congolese
allies are often hampered by a lack of trust. Rwandan troops are
seen by non-Tutsis as a necessary evil who stay on longer than they
are needed.
	   Kabangu Kalunga, a former army intelligence officer under
Mobutu, said he was sent to fight Tutsi-led rebels in Rwanda in
1991, a year after they invaded Rwanda and engaged the forces of
Mobutu's ally, former Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana.
	   In 1996, he fought the Rwandans again when they backed the
rebels who ousted Mobutu and put Kabila in power.
	   ``Now, we're fighting alongside them,'' he said, after
struggling to explain to his Rwandan counterpart where to deliver
food for rebel troops in Kindu.
	   The Rwandan captain spoke only Kinyarwanda, and Kabangu Kalunga
spoke only French and Congolese languages.

Forest fires intensify in Israel, Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with three Lebanese injured &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Forest fires raged for a fourth straight day in
northern and central Israel on Tuesday, temporarily closing a major
highway and forcing thousands of people from their homes, while
three civil defense workers were injured fighting fires destroying
farmlands in Lebanon.
	   Fires in the Carmel forests blazed out of control near the
northern port city of Haifa, and residents of three nearby villages
were evacuated from the area, some for the second time in two days.
	   In the Western Galilee, fire destroyed 25 acres (10 hectares) of
forest, Israel radio said.
	   In the hills near Jerusalem, fires smoldering since Monday
intensified Tuesday, sending thick clouds of smoke toward the
Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway and briefly forcing the closure of the
major thoroughfare.
	   Meanwhile, a court on Tuesday extended the arrest of three
Israeli Arab youths being held on suspicion of having set fire to
wilderness areas near Wadi Ara in northern Israel.
	   Earlier this month, Wadi Ara was the site of clashes between
Israeli Arabs and police over a land dispute.
	   Officials said most of the other fires were started accidentally
by picnickers who left coals burning in the forest while visiting
during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, which ended Monday.
Unseasonably hot, dry conditions and strong winds in the region
also helped the fires spread.
	   In Lebanon, fires have already destroyed 1,750 square kilometers
(675 square miles) of pine forest and olive and citrus groves.
	   Hundreds of firefighters, soldiers and civilians worked Tuesday
to control the blazes. U.N. peacekeepers deployed north of the
border with Israel have used helicopters to drop water on the
fires.
	   Three civil defense workers were injured fighting fires near the
southern provincial capital of Sidon, Lebanese radio stations
reported.
	   The blazes began this weekend in the wooded hills of Batroun in
northern Lebanon. They spread quickly to areas that were unusually
dry due to a recent heat wave.
	   Some 150 fires have been reported in areas ranging from the
outskirts of Tripoli, 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Beirut, to
villages south of the port city of Tyre, 60 miles (100 kilometers)
south of the capital.

Russian sugar producers want higher import taxes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian sugar producers want higher import taxes
to protect them from a flow of cheap surplus sugar accumulated on
world markets, the Interfax news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The Russian Sugar Producers' Union wants the government to raise
import taxes from 25 percent to 30 percent for the first half of
next year, and to 45 percent for the second half of the year, when
Russia's sugar refining season begins, Interfax said.
	   Interfax estimated that Russia consumes 4.7 million tons of
sugar each year. Sugar production since the start of 1998 was 3.5
million tons, according to the Food and Agriculture Ministry,
Interfax said.

Holyfield-Lewis fight will go ahead

 &UR; Eds: Updates and adds King quotes in 6th graf

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A world heavyweight title unification fight
between WBA and IBF titlist Evander Holyfield and WBC champion
Lennox Lewis will go ahead next year if both boxers accept the
challenge.
	   It's the heavyweight showdown the boxing world has been
clamoring for.
	   Holyfield's promoter Don King confirmed the proposed bout
Tuesday after meeting Lewis' promoter Panos Eliades and manager
Frank Maloney in London.
	   The fight is tentatively scheduled for late February or early
March and the venue is expected to be in Las Vegas.
	   Holyfield will reportedly earn dlrs 20 million for putting up
his two belts, while Lewis is expected to earn 8 million for
putting his title on the line.
	   ``It's on, that's for sure,'' King said Tuesday.
	   ``I've spoken to Evander and it's on, he's ready.
	   ``I don't deal with excuses, I deal with results. There are no
potential stumbling blocks on my side.
	   ``If the fighters don't agree they should be cut adrift in a
lifeboat with just bread and water.''
	   King said he only had one problem to ``sort out'' with Eliades.
	   In April, Holyfield declined a dlrs 20 million offer from Home
Box Office cable network to fight Lewis.
	   But King said Tuesday that he had come to a deal with HBO. The
fight is expected to be screened by TVKO, the pay-per-view arm of
HBO.
	   King described the stakes up for grabs as the title for the
``undisputed, unadulterated, unmitigated champion of the world.''
	   King said he wanted to ``give the people what they want.''
	   ``If this fight doesn't happen now, rest assured of me that it
would be because of the fighters themselves and no-one else,'' he
said.
	   Maloney said the bout would be the most important fight in
recent history.
	   ``We wanted to put it on. Don King wants to put (the fight) on
because he knows that's what the world wants. He wants to be the
good guy. It's up to the boxers now,'' Maloney said Tuesday.
	   Maloney didn't discount Lewis' chances of beating the American
dual champion, although there is reportedly a clause in the
contract for a return bout if Lewis loses.
	   ``Hopefully we will be able to bring Lennox back to Britain as
the world's undisputed champion. It was a fight that had to be made
now and could not wait any longer,'' he said.

Rights groups demand answers after govt reveals deaths of
</HEADLINE>
opponents &QL; 
 &UR; By ABDELHAKIM YAMANI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RABAT, Morocco (AP) _ Human rights groups and family members
were demanding answers Tuesday, a day after the government admitted
that 56 political opponents missing since the 1960s were dead.
	   ``They announced the numbers as if they were talking about
election results,'' said Abdelkrim El Manouzi, the brother of
Houcine El Manouzi, missing since 1972.
	   Human rights activist Abdelilah Benabdeslam said the government
was hiding crucial facts.
	   ``They announce the disappearances, but they don't say anything
about the circumstances,'' he complained.
	   Another human rights leader, Abdelaziz Bennani, called the lack
of information ``inhuman.''
	   ``It is urgent that we know the details of every case,'' he
said.
	   On Monday, the government's official human rights council said
that among 112 people declared missing by their families or by
non-governmental organizations since the 1960s, 56 were dead.
	   But it declined to elaborate on the circumstances surrounding
the deaths, which came during years of political repression by the
government of King Hassan II.
	   Hassan, who has in recent years loosened his grip on the
government and sought to liberalize the country, called on the
Moroccan parliament Friday to settle remaining human rights cases
within six months.
	   Driss Dahak, head of the Consultative Council for Human Rights,
said Monday the council would set up a commission to examine cases
of disappeared prisoners.
	   He would not comment on an alleged 500 missing ethnic Sahrawis
from the Western Sahara, a territory Morocco claims.
	   Regarding the rest of the 112 reported disappeared, Dahak said
12 had been freed. But the whereabouts of 44 remained unknown,
including six who were likely dead and 18 who disappeared ``under
mysterious conditions,'' he said without elaborating.
	   For years, Morocco was known to maintain secret detention
centers in Rabat and Casablanca, as well as an internment camp in
the south. Most of those detained were leftists, though many
members of the military were arrested after a foiled coup in 1972.

Swaziland security forces raid homes of opposition figures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ Security forces raided the homes of
several opposition leaders Tuesday, three days before the kingdom
of Swaziland holds parliamentary elections.
	   Police spokeswoman Leckina Magagula described the early-morning
raids as routine crime-fighting efforts. But one opposition leader
whose home was raided saw a political motive.
	   ``They don't like what we're saying about the elections,'' said
Mario Masuko, president of the People's United Democratic Movement.
	   Masuko's group calls the elections meaningless because only
candidates approved by the monarchy can run. Political parties have
been banned since 1973 in Swaziland, which is ruled by King Mswati
III.
	   Masuko said about 50 armed police and soldiers arrived at his
home in a dozen trucks as he prepared to take his children to
school.
	   ``They said they wanted to search my home for subversive
items,'' Masuko recounted in a telephone interview.
	   They spent 40 minutes searching his home but found no
contraband, Masuko added.
	   Voters on Friday are to choose 55 members of parliament's lower
house. The king appoints the remaining 10 members.
	   He also appoints 20 members to parliament's upper house, with
the lower house appointing the remaining 10 members.
	   The Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions has also criticized the
election. Many union members plan a boycott.
	   The raids come on the heels of an upheaval in Lesotho, another
kingdom located within South Africa's borders.
	   On Sept. 22, South African troops entered Lesotho to quell an
army mutiny and other unrest linked to recent elections which the
opposition claims were rigged.
	   The intervention resulted in firefights between South African
and Lesotho troops and a looting and arson spree. Scores died.
	   Mindful of that, Masuku said his group doesn't want to incite
violence Friday.
	   ``I think people will stay in their homes,'' Masuku said. ``We
have all said we want democratization and transformation, but we
don't want bloodshed.''

German Jewish leader criticizes book prize recipient's speech
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEORGE BOEHMER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The leader of Germany's Jews on
Tuesday criticized a renowned German writer for suggesting during
an acceptance speech for a prestigious literary prize that the
nation's Nazi past is overemphasized.
	   Martin Walser, 71, was honored Sunday with the Frankfurt Book
Fair's Peace Prize for his postwar novels exploring the conscience
of Germans rebuilding from the destruction of the Nazi era.
	   During his acceptance speech, Walser said that he is upset that
Germany's Nazi past, and the Auschwitz death camp that has come to
symbolize the evil of the era, continue to be ``presented like
never before.''
	   Walser said the constant references ``instrumentalize our shame
for current purposes,'' that is to inflict guilt on a new
generation of Germans.
	   The chairman of Germany's Central Council of Jews, Ignatz Bubis,
called the remarks ``spiritual arson.''
	   Bubis, who lost his entire family in the Nazis' Auschwitz death
camp in occupied Poland, said he was particularly stung by Walser's
contention that reminding the world about the horrors of Aushwitz
was ``instrumentalizing'' the death camp.
	   Bubis said that Walser's opinion was one ``that a few years ago
was spread in primitive circles,'' and considered extremist, but
has now spread to ``intellectual circles. It's a new trend.''
	   Walser has sought through his numerous books and plays to
reconcile German guilt over the Holocaust with a young postwar
generation's desire to look to the future.
	   In awarding him the prize, the German Book Trade Association
said Walser's novels and essays ``explained to the world and to
Germans their own country and brought them closer together.''
	   Bubis, who attended the presentation, said he would comment
further on Walser's speech during his remarks on the anniversary of
Kristallnacht _ the so-called Night of Broken Glass when Nazi thugs
plundered Jewish business and homes throughout Germany the night of
Nov. 8-9, 1938.
	   Numerous Jews were beaten and arrested, signaling the start of
the Holocaust.
	   ``Whether it suits Mr. Walser or not, we will continue to
remember Nov. 9, and we will continue to remember the freeing of
Auschwitz,'' Bubis said.
	   ``And if he's so upset by the `instrumentalizing' as he calls it
... if his forefathers had done something to stop Auschwitz from
happening, then there would be no `instrumentalizing.'''
	   Some 1.5 million people, most of them Jews, perished at the
Auschwitz camp set up by the Nazis in occupied Poland during World
War II. In all, about 11 million people pershished under the Nazis,
including 6 million Jews.

Russia's Central Bankers may be prosecuted
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Central Bank officers may face criminal
charges if prosecutors find evidence that their actions led to the
collapse of the ruble in August, Russia's top prosecutor said
Tuesday.
	   Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov said his office was
investigating whether the bankers had committed crimes in treasury
bill and bank-to-bank credit transactions before the government
defaulted on its debts and devalued the ruble on Aug. 17, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``We must find out whether Central Bank officials are guilty of
abuse of office,'' Skuratov told journalists, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   The prosecutor's office is also looking into why some Central
Bank officials received salaries in 1997 that were far higher than
wages for other government officials, not to mention average
Russians.
	   The head of the Central Bank, Sergei Dubinin, reported earning a
salary worth dlrs 240,000 in 1997, and other Central Bankers
reported salaries worth more than dlrs 130,000 for the same period.
	   In contrast, President Boris Yeltsin made dlrs 117,000 last
year, and most of that was from a book deal with Western
publishers. An average worker in Russia makes about dlrs 300 a
month.
	   Still, Skuratov made clear that the concept of criminal offense
must not be confused with poor judgment. ``We will not try to
prosecute officials for failure to take steps to overcome the
crisis or for ill-advised moves,'' Interfax quoted him as saying.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Winding up her tour of eastern
Europe, U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton discussed civil
society with the world's pundits Tuesday and sipped liqueur in a
cafe with the Czech president and his wife.
	   Speaking at the Forum 2000, a prestigious gathering of over 50
intellectuals and political and religious activists, Mrs. Clinton
tried to define society's role in post-communist countries.
	   She praised Bulgaria and Slovakia for their progress in building
a society that includes independent cultural and advocacy groups
that are particularly important in emerging democracies after
decades of totalitarian rule.
	   ``Much of the success in the recent election in Slovakia owes
its roots to the recognition that ... citizen activities were
necessary preconditions for true democratic values,'' she said.
	   Mrs. Clinton was invited to attend the conference by Czech
President Vaclav Havel, a co-sponsor of the conference and a civil
society advocate himself.
	   Before lunch, Mrs. Clinton, accompanied by Havel and his wife,
Dagmar, stopped briefly in the Slavia cafe, Havel's favorite
hangout in his dissident years, for a glass of absinthe.
	   Young people watching the presidential motorcade in the street
were largely indifferent to Mrs. Clinton's visit, but others inside
the cafe were appreciative.
	   The visit to Prague was a continuation of Mrs. Clinton's
four-day trip to eastern Europe and her second visit to the Czech
Republic in the last two years. She spent the first two days in
Bulgaria speaking with students and businesswomen.
	   Mrs. Clinton was due back in Washington on Tuesday night.

Krajicek, Martin advance to second round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Former Wimbledon champion Richard
Krajicek began his comeback after a knee injury by advancing to the
second round of the CA Trophy ATP tennis tournament Tuesday.
	   Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion and this year's
semifinalist, beat Albert Costa of Spain 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4.
	   The sixth-seeded Dutchman had not played a match in five weeks
after tendinitis in his left knee forced him to retire in the
fourth round of the French Open.
	   Costa saved two match points in the ninth game of the third set.
But Krajicek served out the match in the next game to set up a
second-round clash against Cedric Pioline.
	   Todd Martin also reached the second round by coming from behind
to oust new German hope Nicolas Kiefer 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
	   Kiefer received a warning for arguing too loudly over several
line calls to give Martin a break point in the third game of the
second set. The German saved it, but Martin still gained the
decisive break of serve to go up 3-0 and tie the score.
	   In the third, a powerful forehand by Martin clipped the net cord
and gave the American another break for a 4-3 lead. Martin was down
a break point in the next game, but fired two aces in a row,
including the game-clinching one with a second serve, to protect
his lead.
	   Martin hit a service winner to win the match after two hours and
five minutes.
	   In other matches, Tommy Haas defeated Arnaud Clement 6-4, 1-6,
6-3, and qualifier Jeff Tarango upset Jason Stoltenberg 6-2, 6-2 to
set a second-round showdown with top-ranked Pete Sampras.

Ukraine concerned about EU expansion ahead of summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine favors the European Union's
expansion but wants to minimize the potential negative consequences
for itself, a top Foreign Ministry official said Tuesday.
	   First Deputy Foreign Minister Anton Buteiko said Ukraine would
raise its concerns at a summit with European Union and European
Commission leaders, scheduled for Oct. 16 in Vienna, Austria.
	   President Leonid Kuchma is to head Ukraine's delegation to the
summit, which would follow his official visit to Austria earlier in
the week.
	   Ukraine is concerned that the possible admission of new members
such as Poland and Hungary into the European Union would complicate
trade and travel for its own citizens.
	   New members ``are practically adopting the rules ... determined
by the EU charter,'' which might negatively affect Ukraine, Buteiko
noted.
	   Buteiko said the summit would focus on the political situation
in Ukraine and in Europe, including the Balkan conflict, Ukraine's
economic ties with the EU and its relations with neighboring
nations.
	   Ukraine plans to raise the issue of its admission as associated
EU member, according to Ukrainian officials.
	   In Austria, Kuchma is scheduled to meet with President Thomas
Klestil, Chancellor Viktor Klima and other officials.
	   Klima, whose country currently holds the rotating EU presidency,
also is to participate in the Ukraine-EU meeting, where he will be
joined by the president of the European Commission, Jacques Santer,
according to Ukrainian reports.

Netanyahu seeks Cabinet backing for agreement with Palestinians

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Cabinet hard-liners asked Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday to link a West Bank troop pullback to
Palestinian security guarantees, and an Israeli swimming in a
spring was shot dead in an attack blamed on Palestinian militants.
	   The shooting and the hard-liners' demands came a day before
Netanyahu was to leave for Washington for meetings with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton is pushing the two to conclude an
agreement on a long-overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank.
	   Palestinian militants have carried out a series of drive-by
shootings in recent years in hopes of wrecking peace talks.
	   In Tuesday's attack, an assailant fired from a pistol at two
Israeli men bathing in a spring near the communal farm of Ora west
of Jerusalem, said police spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby. One man was
killed and the second critically wounded, the spokesman said. The
assailants' car was later found abandoned near the West Bank.
	   In a special eight-hour Cabinet meeting, ministers from the
National Religious Party demanded that Netanyahu not hand over any
land to the Palestinians unless they extradite suspects in attacks
on Israelis and cancel clauses in the PLO founding charter that
call for the destruction of Israel, said party spokesman Joshua
Mor-Yosef.
	   In addition, the NRP stipulated that Netanyahu not sign a
withdrawal agreement unless the scope of an additional pullback is
decided on now, Mor-Yosef said.
	   If Netanyahu wraps up a deal without meeting these conditions
the NRP will bring down the government, Mor-Yosef said. The party,
the patron of the Jewish settlement movement in the West Bank and
Gaza, has enough seats in the 120-member parliament to rob
Netanyahu of his parliamentary majority.
	   A government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Netanyahu will support the NRP's demands on security and the PLO
Charter, but will not agree to any formal Cabinet decision
restricting his power to negotiate.
	   Also Tuesday, a group of legislators from Netanyahu's coalition
known as the Land of Israel Front issued a new ultimatum, saying
they would topple the government if the prime minister agreed to a
West Bank withdrawal. The group has 11 legislators, enough to bring
down the government.

Launch of U.S. satellite postponed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The launch of an American communications satellite
aboard a Russian booster rocket has been postponed because of
problems with the satellite's transmission system, a news report
said Tuesday.
	   The Telstar-6 satellite has been sent back to the United States,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing the Khrunichev space
company. The Space Systems Loral company, which built the
satellite, has detected a malfunction in its transmission system,
the report said. The U.S. firm is a subsidiary of Loral Space and
Communications Ltd. of New York.
	   The satellite was to be carried into orbit on Wednesday by a
Proton booster blasting off the Baikonur cosmodrome, which Russia
rents from the Central Asian nation of Kazakstan.
	   This is the fifth time this year that the Khrunichev company _
which manufactures the Proton _ had to postpone a launch because of
satellite malfunctions, the report said.
	   Last month, the launch of an American Telesat Communications
satellite was delayed for at least a year and the satellite
returned to the United States.

Hard-line Iranian militia volunteers demonstrate against Rushdie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ About 1,000 hard-liners, many of them
militia volunteers, demonstrated Tuesday outside Tehran University,
shouting that the religious edict against writer Salman Rushdie
remained in force.
	   The demonstration occurred as Abdollah Nouri, a deputy to
moderate President Mohammad Khatami, delivered a speech at the
university on civil liberties.
	   One of the hard-liners tried to hit Nouri as he was leaving the
campus, but four bodyguards protected him and whisked him away in
his car.
	   Militants also attacked Nouri and Ataollah Mohajerani, the
minister of culture and Islamic guidance, on Sept. 4.
	   The demonstrators called for the death of Rushdie.
	   ``The edict is irrevocable, and we emphasize the implementation
of this edict against apostate Salman Rushdie independent of any
diplomatic negotiations conducted by Iran's government,'' said a
statement distributed by the Basij Resistance Forces, a militia
that assists the army in wartime.
	   A ``fatwa,'' or religious edict, was issued by the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini against Rushdie in 1989 on grounds his
book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' was blasphemous.
	   Khatami's government has tried to distance itself from offers by
Iranian groups to pay money to anyone implementing the fatwa.
	   On Monday, a foundation that initially offered dlrs 2.5 million
to anyone who kills Rushdie raised the reward to dlrs 2.8 million.
	   Last Saturday, a hard-line student group offered its own reward
of dlrs 333,000.
	   The edict has strained ties between Iran and the West,
especially Britain. Britain restored diplomatic relations last
month after Khatami's government distanced itself from the reward
offering.
	   Rushdie, who spent nearly a decade in hiding after Khomeini
issued the edict, expressed relief that the ordeal was over.

England, coach Hoddle under pressure against tiny Luxembourg
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ It's a game England might find hard to lose,
but then again, coach Glenn Hoddle has already worked himself in a
no-win situation when his squad plays the part-timers of Luxembourg
in a Euro 2000 qualifier Wednesday.
	   Hoddle's job and England's qualification for the European
Championship are on the line after two pitiful performances left
England with just one point out of two games. Poland leads with a
maximum 6 points while Sweden has 3.
	   Thrash Luxembourg by a huge margin and it will be considered an
obvious result. Anything less will heap even more pressure and
abuse on the embattled coach.
	   ``When you don't start well then the pressure to win matches
increases,'' said Hoddle ahead of Wednesday's game. Especially the
dull goalless draw against Bulgaria over the weekend had critics
calling for his head.
	   ``If we don't win matches then we've certainly got problems but
we'll face that as and when it comes,'' he said.
	   Now, in a twist of irony, he is counting on the return of David
Beckham to augur a revival, four months after the Manchester United
playmaker was widely blamed for kicking England out of the World
Cup with a red card against Argentina in the second round.
	   He was suspended two games for kicking an opponent and returns
against Luxembourg. It was supposed to be the easiest of tasks. Now
it is fraught with danger.
	   ``When he puts on the England shirt again he's going to be extra
determined after what happened in the World Cup,'' said Hoddle.
	   His skills are a the key aspect now missing in England's game,
the ability to split the defense with a single touch of the ball.
	   Beckham may return but Hoddle has other problems instead. Jamie
Redknapp and Paul Ince are both suspended and several other players
face late fitness tests.
	   Luxembourg is missing its captain and central defender Marc
Birssens, who was sent off in the weekend 3-0 loss to Poland.
	   And even though its record falls woefully short of England's
record _ the last four matches amount to a 20-0 goal difference in
England's favor _ Luxembourg can provide a surprise. It has beaten
the Czech Republic and came stunningly close to gaining a draw
against then World Champion Germany, losing 3-2 in 1990.
	   Hoddle needs no warnings.
	   He has already seen France slump to a 1-1 draw in Iceland and
Cyprus beat Spain this Fall.
	   ``You can come unstuck in any game of soccer,'' said Hoddle.

U.S. hopes new accord will break treaty logjam
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Negotiators Tuesday signed an agreement the
Clinton administration hopes will break the logjam that has blocked
major nuclear-weapons treaties in the Russian State Duma and U.S.
Senate.
	   The latest accord, while technical and detailed, brings
up-to-date the old Soviet-U.S. Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, said
a U.S. official close to the negotiations.
	   At stake are the 1996 global accord to ban nuclear-weapons tests
and the 1993 U.S.-Russian START II pact to reduce their arsenals
which have been caught in an international gridlock.
	   The Russian parliament, concerned about NATO expansion and other
issues, has refused to ratify the missile-reduction pact, while the
U.S. Senate is hesitating over the test ban.
	   ``We understood that the Duma wanted us to get the ABM issues
squared away before they were willing to act on START II,'' said
the U.S. official, who briefed a small group of reporters on
condition of anonymity. ``Now we've done that.''
	   ``We believe that everything has been accomplished that's
necessary for the Duma to act. It's now in their hands.''
	   The Duma has refused to ratify START II pending assurances from
the United States that it will stick to the 1972 ABM, to which key
members of the Republican-controlled Congress object.
	   The Senate approved START II in January 1996.
	   The ABM treaty, which severely limits anti-missile defenses, is
founded on the principle that a country without a defense against
long-range missiles would not launch an attack for fear of
devastating retaliation.
	   Some Republicans in Congress regard the treaty as outdated and
favor development of a national ABM system.
	   Signed in Geneva on Tuesday was an implementing agreement of an
update to the ABM, which basically makes the treaty apply to all
the involved republics of the former Soviet Union _ Russia,
Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakstan _ and the United States.
	   The Clinton administration plans to submit the ABM agreements to
the Senate as soon as the Duma ratifies them.
	   Then Russia and the United States can move onto the next stage
of missile reduction, START III.
	   The latest ABM accords include spelling out the way each country
notifies the others about test launches of shorter-range missiles.
	   They detail procedures for implementing the ABM update signed at
the United Nations in September 1997, pending ratification by all
signing countries.
	   Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakstan remain part of the accord because
they retain elements of the old Soviet missile-defense system,
which is aimed at protecting Moscow.
	   The ABM missile test range is in Kazakstan, while early warning
radars are in Ukraine and Belarus. Early warning radars that were
in Latvia have been eliminated.

Serbian government announces political plan for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Rushing to meet a Friday deadline
set by NATO, the Serbian government on Tuesday outlined its plan of
a political solution for the Kosovo crisis and announced local
elections in the province for 1999.
	   The ``principles for a political solution with a time frame for
their fulfillment'' envisage self-rule in Kosovo, establishment of
local police, elections within nine months, amnesty and an
international investigation of alleged war crimes and monitoring.
	   The 11-point statement by the Serbian government said:
``Citizens of Kosovo will establish democratic self-rule through an
assembly, executive and judicial bodies.''
	   The government said elections in Kosovo, including municipal
ones, will be held within nine months. The 54-nation Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe is invited to monitor them,
said the statement carried by Tanjug.
	   It also said national minorities will enjoy additional rights in
accordance with international standards so that ``they can preserve
and express their national, cultural, religious and language
identity.''
	   The government said a local police force will be established
under the control of local authorities. It would ``reflect the
composition of the local population,'' meaning it would be mostly
Albanian.
	   The government offered an amnesty for those who fought against
the government forces, except those who committed war crimes. It
said it would allow access to foreign experts, including forensic
experts to help investigate.
	   The official statement also announced that past prison sentences
against ethnic Albanians, based on political motives, would be
reconsidered.
	   By Oct. 19, agreements with NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
and Bronislaw Geremek, the current head of OSCE, will be signed.
	   A political draft agreement based should be reached by Nov. 2
and elections set by Nov. 9, the statement said.

European Central Bank chief sees no need to lower key interest
</HEADLINE>
rates &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The head of the new European Central
Bank said Tuesday that there was no need to lower key interest
rates worldwide in an attempt to correct global financial turmoil.
	   European Central Bank chief Wim Duisenberg, who heads the
powerful body setting financial policy for the single European
currency to be launched Jan. 1, said dropping interest rates would
compound uncertainties underlying the market volatility.
	   ``Recent calls for worldwide unified interest rate reductions
are inappropriate as they do not address the very nature of the
problem,'' said Duisenberg, the former Dutch central banker.
	   Rather, he said, ``proposals inspired by policy activists'' are
of utmost importance.
	   Duisenberg heads the ECB's governing council, which met Tuesday
to discuss merging financial polices ahead of the common currency's
launch.
	   Among the tasks ahead for the council _ comprised of central
bankers from the 11 nations adopting the single currency, or euro _
is setting a single European interest rate before the launch, which
will bring down rates in most countries in any case.
	   The bankers are expected to set Europe's unified interest rate
to match Germany's core rate of 3.3 percent, and about half of the
countries launching the euro have rates higher than that.
	   Duisenberg did not immediately comment on the governing
council's position on a euro zone-wide rate.
	   Speculation about a possible rate reduction has grown since the
United States cut its rate last week.
	   Germany's incoming finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, for one,
wants rates cut to stimulate growth, although Germany's central
banker, Hans Tietmeyer, on Monday called for a steady German rate.
	   Such comments by Lafontaine have raised concerns that Germany's
Social Democrats, who will form a government at the end of October,
will try to exert political influence on the new bank, which is
modeled closely on Germany's own Bundesbank.
	   Lafontaine, the Social Democratic party leader, has made clear
his desire for a political counterweight to the European Central
Bank.
	   For now, analysts think the bank will resist any pressures.
	   Greater political influence could begin next July, when the term
of Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer expires and the Social
Democratic-led government will choose a replacement.
	   Tietmeyer sits on the European Central Bank's governing council,
and his deputy, Otmar Issing, is a member of the bank's six-member
executive board.

German Jewish leader criticizes book prize recipient's speech
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Auschwitz in 6th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE BOEHMER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The leader of Germany's Jews on
Tuesday criticized a renowned German writer for suggesting during
an acceptance speech for a prestigious literary prize that the
nation's Nazi past is overemphasized.
	   Martin Walser, 71, was honored Sunday with the Frankfurt Book
Fair's Peace Prize for his postwar novels exploring the conscience
of Germans rebuilding from the destruction of the Nazi era.
	   During his acceptance speech, Walser said that he is upset that
Germany's Nazi past, and the Auschwitz death camp that has come to
symbolize the evil of the era, continue to be ``presented like
never before.''
	   Walser said the constant references ``instrumentalize our shame
for current purposes,'' that is to inflict guilt on a new
generation of Germans.
	   The chairman of Germany's Central Council of Jews, Ignatz Bubis,
called the remarks ``spiritual arson.''
	   Bubis, who lost his entire family in the Nazis' Auschwitz death
camp in occupied Poland, said he was particularly stung by Walser's
contention that reminding the world about the horrors of Auschwitz
was ``instrumentalizing'' the death camp.
	   Bubis said that Walser's opinion was one ``that a few years ago
was spread in primitive circles,'' and considered extremist, but
has now spread to ``intellectual circles. It's a new trend.''
	   Walser has sought through his numerous books and plays to
reconcile German guilt over the Holocaust with a young postwar
generation's desire to look to the future.
	   In awarding him the prize, the German Book Trade Association
said Walser's novels and essays ``explained to the world and to
Germans their own country and brought them closer together.''
	   Bubis, who attended the presentation, said he would comment
further on Walser's speech during his remarks on the anniversary of
Kristallnacht _ the so-called Night of Broken Glass when Nazi thugs
plundered Jewish business and homes throughout Germany the night of
Nov. 8-9, 1938.
	   Numerous Jews were beaten and arrested, signaling the start of
the Holocaust.
	   ``Whether it suits Mr. Walser or not, we will continue to
remember Nov. 9, and we will continue to remember the freeing of
Auschwitz,'' Bubis said.
	   ``And if he's so upset by the `instrumentalizing' as he calls it
... if his forefathers had done something to stop Auschwitz from
happening, then there would be no `instrumentalizing.'''
	   Some 1.5 million people, most of them Jews, perished at the
Auschwitz camp set up by the Nazis in occupied Poland during World
War II. In all, about 11 million people perished under the Nazis,
including 6 million Jews.

Azerbaijan's president claims winning 75 percent of vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Even as ballots were still being
counted, President Geidar Aliev claimed victory Tuesday in
Azerbaijan's presidential election and criticized international
observers for calling the vote fraudulent.
	   Aliev told a news conference that he had information that he'd
received more than 75 percent of votes Sunday in this oil-rich
Caspian Sea nation. That exceeds the two-thirds majority that a
candidate needs for victory in the first round.
	   The central electoral commission had said that official results
would not be known for four days following the election.
	   Aliev protested a joint statement released Monday by the
Organization for Security and Europe and the Council of Europe,
alleging ``blatant violations of the law'' in the election process.
	   The two international election monitoring organizations, which
together deployed more than 150 observers for the vote, did not say
whether the fraud was significant enough to invalidate the election
outcome.
	   ``The assessment by the OSCE and the Council of Europe, which
stated yesterday that the election failed to meet international
standards, could have been more objective,'' Aliev said.
	   Aliev controls the Central Election commission, and with leading
opposition groups boycotting the vote, few doubted that the
autocratic leader would be re-elected over the five other
candidates.
	   Turnout was high, with 78 percent of eligible voters casting
ballots, easily surpassing the 25 percent minimum turnout required
to validate the election, the central electoral commission
reported.
	   The main opposition leaders decided to boycott the election,
saying that Aliev would stack the ballot in his favor.

10 Iranians released by Afghanistan's Taliban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Ten Iranians who were released by
Afghanistan's Taliban militia have returned home, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported Tuesday.
	   The Iranians arrived Monday in Tehran aboard a Red Cross plane,
the agency said.
	   On Sunday, the Taliban returned the bodies of three slain
Iranian diplomats.
	   Both gestures were seen as trying to temper tensions between the
Taliban and Iran, which has massed more than 200,000 troops on its
eastern border with Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban has acknowledged that renegade militiamen killed
eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist after the Taliban captured
the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Iran had demanded the Taliban return the bodies of the Iranians
and send the killers for trial in Tehran. Six bodies were returned
earlier, but the Taliban has refused to hand over the suspected
killers.
	   Last Friday, the Taliban released five Iranians captured during
the militia's sweep of western Afghanistan.
	   More than 60 Iranians are still believed to be in Taliban
custody, including some 30 that Iran says were drivers delivering
humanitarian aid.
	   Taliban leaders, who are mostly Sunni Muslims, accuse Iran of
arming and financing Afghanistan's northern-based opposition, which
includes the country's minority Shiite Muslims. Most Iranians also
are Shiite Muslims.

Five scientists working in the United States get Nobels

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Five scientists at universities in the
United States won the Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry Tuesday
for work exploring the inner structure of matter.
	   Their research has far-reaching implications, from a new
generation of microelectronics to understanding the destruction of
Earth's ozone layer.
	   Three physicists will share the prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior, work that could lead to further
advances in microelectronics.
	   And two researchers were named co-winners of the chemistry prize
for theoretical research into the quantum properties of molecules.
	   In each case, the winners will share the 7.6-million-kronor
(dlrs 978,000) prizes.
	   The chemistry award went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California-Santa Barbara and John Pople of Northwestern University.
Kohn, 75, was born in Vienna, Austria. He has taught at U.S.
institutions since 1950, and at Santa Barbara since 1979.
	   Kohn was cited for development of density-functional theory in
the 1960s. It simplifies the mathematical description of the
bonding between atoms that make up molecules.
	   His approach makes calculations according to an average number
of electrons located in any point, rather than trying to establish
the motion of each electron in every atom in a molecule. This
reliable model has enabled scientists to study large molecules that
previously were too complex and unwieldy to understand.
	   Pople, 72, is a British citizen. He joined the faculty at
Canegie-Mellon University in 1964 before relocating to Northwestern
in 1986.
	   Pople was cited for developing computer techniques to test the
chemical structure and details of matter. The resulting computer
program is used by thousands of universities and companies
worldwide. In the 1990s, he has refined the program to include
Kohn's density-functional theory.
	   His approach allows scientists to create computer models of
chemical reactions that are difficult or impossible to recreate in
the laboratory. It has a wide range of applications, from studying
interstellar matter based on telescope measurements of its chemical
signatures and how pollutants such as freon react with the ozone
layer.
	   In medicine, researchers use Pople's quantum chemistry methods
to simulate the effects of proposed drugs to fight HIV infection.
	   The laureates in physics are Robert B. Laughlin of the United
States, Horst L. Stormer of Germany and Daniel C. Tsui, a native of
China who is now an American citizen.
	   They discovered that ordinary electrons acting together in
strong magnetic fields and very low temperatures can condense into
new types of composite subatomic particles that function as a
fluid, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. Subsequently,
other researchers confirmed their experiments and directly observed
these new composites, known as quasiparticles.
	   ``Usually in physics, you break things into smaller and smaller
pieces,'' said Stormer. ``But here ... the big electrons stay
perfectly intact, yet they create smaller units that look like
electrons that have a charge that is one-third or one-fifth or
one-seventh of an electron and (yet) doesn't break apart.''
	   Laughlin works at Stanford University, Stormer is at Columbia
University and Tsui teaches at Princeton University. The award
recognizes work Tsui and Stormer did together in 1982. Laughlin
elaborated on the work the next year.
	   Laughlin, 47, who did his graduate studies at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, got the news in the middle of the night.
	   ``The reason why this is important is that it has to do with why
the universe is the way it is,'' he said today. ``You can chop (the
universe) to pieces or learn how all the pieces work together. This
is a triumph of the second.''
	   According to the citation, the three men discovered a new form
of ``quantum fluid'' _ fluids such as liquid helium that have
certain properties in common, such as superfluidity, or the absence
of energy resistance at ultra-low temperatures.
	   What makes these fluids important for researchers is that they
can reveal more about the inner structure and dynamics of matter.
	   It is ``yet another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum
physics and to the development of new theoretical concepts of
significance in many branches of modern physics,'' the academy
said.
	   Mats Jonson, a physics professor at Sweden's respected Chalmers
Institute of Technology, said the laureates' work could be
important in the development of smaller electronic components and
could lead to improving computer memories by manipulating electrons
in this altered state.
	   The development of microelectronics has allowed other
researchers to confirm the work's validity in experiments the
academy likened to ``measuring the sound of individual hailstones
during a hailstorm.''
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for discovering
properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but also a
life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   Their finding helped lead to the discovery of the anti-impotence
drug Viagra.
	   The literature prize was awarded Thursday to Portuguese novelist
Jose Saramago. The economics prize winner is to be named on
Wednesday and the peace prize on Friday.
	   All the prizes are announced in Stockholm, except for the peace
prize which is given in Oslo, Norway. The prizes are presented on
Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish
industrialist and inventor of dynamite who established the prizes
in his will.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Forest fires raged for a fourth straight day in
northern and central Israel on Tuesday, temporarily closing a major
highway and forcing thousands of people from their homes, while
three civil defense workers were injured fighting fires destroying
farmlands in Lebanon.
	   Fires in the Carmel forests blazed out of control near the
northern port city of Haifa, and residents of three nearby villages
were evacuated from the area, some for the second time in two days.
	   In the Western Galilee, fire destroyed 25 acres (10 hectares) of
forest, Israel radio said.
	   In the hills near Jerusalem, fires smoldering since Monday
intensified Tuesday, sending thick clouds of smoke toward the
Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway and briefly forcing the closure of the
major thoroughfare.
	   Meanwhile, a court on Tuesday extended the arrest of three
Israeli Arab youths being held on suspicion of having set fire to
wilderness areas near Wadi Ara in northern Israel.
	   Earlier this month, Wadi Ara was the site of clashes between
Israeli Arabs and police over a land dispute.
	   Officials said most of the other fires were started accidentally
by picnickers who left coals burning in the forest while visiting
during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot, which ended Monday.
Unseasonably hot, dry conditions and strong winds in the region
also helped the fires spread.
	   In Lebanon, fires have already destroyed 1,750 square kilometers
(675 square miles) of pine forest and olive and citrus groves.
	   Hundreds of firefighters, soldiers and civilians worked Tuesday
to control the blazes. U.N. peacekeepers deployed north of the
border with Israel have used helicopters to drop water on the
fires.
	   Three civil defense workers were injured fighting fires near the
southern provincial capital of Sidon, Lebanese radio stations
reported.
	   The blazes began this weekend in the wooded hills of Batroun in
northern Lebanon. They spread quickly to areas that were unusually
dry due to a recent heat wave.
	   Some 150 fires have been reported in areas ranging from the
outskirts of Tripoli, 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Beirut, to
villages south of the port city of Tyre, 60 miles (100 kilometers)
south of the capital.

Akin Birdal tops short list of candidates for Sakharov Prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The Turkish human rights campaigner
Akin Birdal on Tuesday topped a list of three candidates for the
Sakharov Prize, a human rights award given each year by the
European Parliament.
	   The Parliament's foreign affairs committee gave 22 votes to
Birdal, 16 to the ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova and six to
Ukshin Hoti, a political detainee of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's regime.
	   ``This most likely means Birdal will win the prize, although one
tends to be cautious until the winner is announced,'' said Tony
Robinson, spokesman for the Socialist group, the Parliament's
largest faction. The Socialists support Birdal as this year's
winner of the prize.
	   Birdal is the president of Turkey's Human Rights Foundation.
Last May he survived an assassination attempt in his country.
	   There were altogether eight individuals and organizations
nominated for this year's Sakharov Prize. Some of those who did not
make the shortlist include the Dalai Lama and Mordechai Vanunu, who
is serving an 18-year jail sentence in his country for giving away
nuclear secrets.
	   The final decision is up to Parliament President Jose Maria
Gil-Robles and the leaders of all the political groups in the
626-member assembly.
	   They must vote before the Parliament's December session in
Strasbourg, France, at which time the winner will be invited to
accept the award.
	   The prize comes with 15,000 European currency unit (dlrs
16,500).
	   Previous winners of the Sakharov prize include the South African
leader Nelson Mandela, the Burmese opposition leader Aung San Suu
Kyi, and Chinese dissident Wei Jingsheng.

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Excerpts from the Royal Swedish Academy
of Sciences' Nobel Physics Prize citation. The prize went to Robert
C. Laughlin of the United States, Horst L. Stormer of Germany and
Daniel C. Tsui, a China-born American citizen.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   The contributions of the three laureates have ... led to yet
another breakthrough in our understanding of quantum physics and to
the development of new theoretical concepts of significance in many
branches of modern physics.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   The three researchers (discovered) that electrons acting
together in strong magnetic fields can form new types of
``particles,'' with charges that are fractions of electron charges.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Stoermer and Tsui made the discovery in 1982 in an experiment
using extremely powerful magnetic fields and low temperatures.
Through theoretical analysis, (Laughlin) showed that the electrons
in a powerful magnetic field can condense to form a kind of quantum
fluid related to the quantum fluids that occur in superconductivity
and in liquid helium. What makes these fluids particularly
important for researchers is that events in a drop of quantum fluid
can afford more profound insights into the general inner structure
and dynamics of matter.

	   The first known hooligans were detained in Belgium Tuesday and
sent back to England after they tried to get through Brussels

Britannia gets ready to open to the public
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEITH, Scotland (AP) _ A 6.50 pound (dlrs 11) ticket will soon
open doors that previously required a royal bloodline or good
connections to enter.
	   Ticket prices for the former royal yacht Britannia, which opens
to the public next week, were announced Tuesday. Family tickets
will be 18 pounds (dlrs 30) and child tickets 3.75 pounds (dlrs
6.40) for a glance at royalty's former traveling home _ the rooms
where members of Queen Elizabeth II's family entertained, dined and
slept.
	   About 200,000 visitors a year are expected to tour the ship,
which is permanently docked at Leith, a Scottish port.
	   Britannia served as a traveling home for members of Britain's
royal family for nearly 44 years until its retirement in December.
The 412-foot (125-meter) yacht was used by Prince Charles and
Princess Diana on their 1981 honeymoon.
	   The yacht, which had grown too costly to operate, still includes
many of its original features.
	   When it opens to the public Monday, visitors will be given a
chance to tour the former state dining room, but they'll merely be
allowed to peek inside the royal bedrooms.
	   Bob Downie, who heads the management team overseeing the yacht,
said it would be ``inappropriate'' to allow visitors to ``wander
around'' them.
	   The yacht, which also can be rented as a conference center, will
be the centerpiece of a multimillion-pound (dollar) facelift for
Leith harbor.

Finding 2,000 observers may take some time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Despite the rush to implement the Kosovo
accord, officials admitted Tuesday it could take weeks before the
full complement of 2,000 international observers is on the ground
to make sure Slobodan Milosevic is living up to the agreement.
	   Milosevic's acceptance of the ``verification mission'' -- both
NATO aerial reconnaissance flights and the monitors on the ground
-- was a key concession in talks between the Yugoslav president and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to defuse the Kosovo crisis and avoid
NATO airstrikes.
	   ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' Holbrooke insisted
Tuesday in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade. ``They are compliance
verifiers. They will be stationed with Yugoslav government's full
support ... security guarantees and freedom of movement.''
	   President Clinton also underscored the importance of the
mission, saying ``we will not rely on what President Milosevic
says, but what he does for the whole world to see.''
	   He said allowing the international inspectors unfettered access
_ including unrestricted surveillance by NATO aircraft -- was a
test Milosevic must pass in the next four days to avoid military
strikes.
	   But the Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe, which is responsible for the ground component, lacks a
large permanent staff. It will have to turn to its 54 member
states, including the United States, Russia, Canada and European
Union countries, to provide people with the proper training and
skills for the job.
	   ``We are still in the very early planning stage,'' OSCE
spokesman Mons Nyberg said. ``Over the coming weeks, we hope to see
the mission fully activated down there.''
	   As a stopgap measure, OSCE officials plan to use the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, which was activated July 6 under
arrangement worked out between Milosevic and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin.
	   For the past four months, members of the mission -- Americans,
Canadians, Russians and Western Europeans -- have been traveling
around Kosovo, providing their governments with first-hand reports
on the fighting and the suffering of the nearly 300,000 refugees
driven from their homes.
	   But the diplomatic mission numbered only about 50 people. They
were all evacuated this week to neighboring Macedonia, largely
because of fears of reprisals by angry Serbs if NATO launched air
attacks.
	   Under the agreement with Holbrooke, Milosevic promised to
guarantee the safety of the verification mission.
	   Meantime, representatives of the 54 OSCE member states will meet
Thursday in Vienna to give their formal approval for the
verification mission. The current chairman of the OSCE, Polish
Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek, will then fly to Belgrade to
sign the agreement with Milosevic to establish the mission.

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The English are coming and just about everyone
in uniform in this tiny Grand Duchy is on high alert.
	   The national soccer team faces a tough challenge in Wednesday's
Euro 2000 qualifier against England, but so do the police, the army
and customs control officers.
	   Twice over the past quarter century, English hooligans have run
wild through the streets of the capital or in the Josy Barthel
stadium, smashing storefront windows, overturning cars and setting
fires.
	   This year, wherever the English played during the World Cup, a
trail of destruction was left in their wake.
	   Violence also marred their match against Sweden last month, the
last time England played abroad.
	   Little wonder there is a sense of anxiety on Rue Haute, the main
commercial drag of Luxembourg, a country of 400,000 people
surrounded by France, Belgium and Germany.
	   ``We don't know what will come,'' police Commissioner Norbert
Lepage said.
	   ``The only thing that we know is that hooligans will be among
them,'' fellow officer Lt. Col. Pierre Reuland added.
	   England is expected to bring about 2,500 fans to the
8,200-capacity Barthel Stadium, and _ in a nation with only 1,000
police officers _ the potential for trouble is clear. Enough to
call on the army to reinforce security.
	   The fans too won't be in the most upbeat mood after England lost
its first Euro 2000 game in Sweden, and played poorly in a
scoreless draw at Wembley against Bulgaria on Saturday. A slip-up
against the amateurs from Luxembourg would have a devastating
effect.
	   Fears are the English fans could take it out on the town.
	   ``People have been informed and will take precautions,'' Reuland
said. Some shops will close early on Wednesday to avoid any risk.
	   Previous hooligan riots are still burning in the minds of many
here, especially the violence of 1977 when English fans rampaged
despite a 4-0 victory in another European qualifier.
	   ``It was like a war here,'' said Lepage. ``They destroyed just
about everything in sight. It's a long time ago but people
remember.''
	   The town mayor even suggested Luxembourg withdraw if it ever
drew England again.
	   At the time of the riot, international hooliganism was still in
its infancy and police had no clue how to tackle it.
	   Much has changed since.
	   ``This is a new era. Now we have communications with each
other.'' British police is sending a half dozen spotters and there
is contact with colleagues in France, Belgium and the Netherlands,
since many English fans will come through their ports.
	   Even the customs control officers have been put on alert.
Diplomats driving here for European Union meetings were warned they
could face stiffer border controls as Luxembourg wants to leave
nothing to chance.
	   Most of the fans are expected to arrive early Wednesday and with
the 8:30 p.m. (1830GMT) kickoff time, fans will have plenty of time
to try out the local drinking establishments. There is no planned
ban on alcohol sales.
	   After the match, the fans who came by train will have to sit out
the night in Luxembourg since no rail transport will be available
until the morning.

Two suspects in custody for the shooting of U.S. soldier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Two U.S. Army soldiers have been
arrested on suspicion of shooting and seriously wounding a female
soldier three days ago, military officials said Tuesday.
	   A statement from the U.S. Army's 5th Corps headquarters in
Heidelberg declined to release further details about the suspects
or arrests.
	   However, Hanau prosecutors, who also participated in the
investigation, said a 23-year-old U.S. soldier was arrested Monday
and had confessed. They did not mention a second arrest.
	   The 23-year-old female soldier was shot late Saturday from a
nearby field as she was standing guard at the Fliegerhorst Barracks
east of Frankfurt. The soldier, whose identity was not released, is
recovering in a hospital.
	   Hanau prosecutors said the case has been turned over to the
Americans.

Primakov discusses Russia's reforms with Chirac
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economic reforms will continue but will
become more socially oriented, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told
French President Jacques Chirac during a telephone conversation
Tuesday.
	   The Russian premier has said his Cabinet's priorities would be
paying off the the huge backlog of wages and pensions and
compensating the poor for losses caused by inflation.
	   Primakov also told Chirac that Russia would make ``a serious
effort to create favorable conditions for foreign investors,''
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Chirac expressed support for Russian government's actions in
tackling the crisis, Interfax reported.
	   The two also discussed international problems, including the
situation in Kosovo, Interfax reported.
	   Russia strongly opposes NATO plans for airstrikes against
Serbia, the largest republic in Yugoslavia, to end President
Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
France has said it would take part in military action with its NATO
allies.

Netanyahu seeks Cabinet backing for agreement with Palestinians

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of a make-or-break Mideast summit in
Washington, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said no deal would be
signed on an Israeli troop pullback hours after an unknown
assailant fatally shot an Israeli.
	   The violence underscored the key issue of the upcoming summit _
Netanyahu's demand that the Palestinians do more to prevent terror
attacks against Israelis.
	   ``In light of this gloomy reality, there is absolutely no
chance, at this stage, of signing an agreement,'' said a statement
released by Netanyahu's office.
	   The United States wants Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to conclude an agreement on a long-overdue Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   But Netanyahu has come under increasing pressure from right-wing
members of his government and newly appointed Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon, who oppose ceding land to the Palestinians.
	   On Tuesday, Netanyahu's Cabinet issued nine demands which the
Palestinians must meet before a withdrawal can take place.
	   Netanyahu has said he would bring back any deal for government
and possibly parliamentary approval before a signing. But Michael
Kleiner, who represents a powerful 17-member right-wing block in
Netanyahu's coalition, said any indication that Netanyahu would
agree to a pullout, could topple his government.
	   ``To us, initialing is agreement, and that would be enough for
us to bring down the government,'' Kleiner told The Associated
Press. It was the clearest warning yet that Kleiner's colleagues
were serious about walking away from the government.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said the government ``is
seeking to reach an agreement with the Palestinian Authority on the
condition that it will fulfill its commitments and Israel's
security needs will be answered,'' he told reporters after the
cabinet met.
	   The nine demands outlined by the ministers for Netanyahu to
insist on before agreeing to any deal include cooperation on
security, an end to public incitement, disarming militants and
decreasing the size of the Palestinian police force.
	   The Cabinet also said the Palestinians must remove clauses from
its charter calling for Israel's destruction, arrest and extradite
suspects in terror attacks, and fight terror.
	   Netanyahu condemned Tuesday's fatal shooting by an unknown
assailant who fired from a pistol at two Israeli men bathing in a
spring near the communal farm of Ora west of Jerusalem, said police
spokesman Shmuel Ben-Ruby. One man was killed and the second, shot
repeatedly in the stomach and chest, remained in critical condition
in Jerusalem's Hadassah hospital. The assailants' car was later
found abandoned near the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu said that if the assailant fled to Palestinian
territory, as has been the case in the past, that Arafat's
Palestinian Authority must work immediately to apprehend them.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ About 25,000 Iraqi women marched through
the streets Tuesday in a government-organized demonstration to
express anger at U.N. trade sanctions.
	   It was the largest women's protest in Baghdad since the
sanctions were imposed on Iraq in 1990 to punish it for invading
Kuwait.
	   The women carried anti-American placards and shouted slogans
against the U.S. government. ``America is the enemy of God,'' they
screamed as they approached the offices of the U.N. Development
Program in Baghdad where the organizers handed a letter of protest.
	   Most of the women were clothed in black veils and many slapped
their faces and beat their breasts at the sight of vehicles
carrying coffins to symbolize the death of thousands of children
that authories blame on medicine shortages caused by the sanctions.
	   Rfa Ma'rouf, a doctor at a Baghdad children's hospital, said
about 200 babies die every day in her hospital. ``Our children are
dying. They are innocent and no one cares,'' she said.
	   Hana' Mahmoud said she joined the demonstration to tell the
world that Iraqi children cannot be held responsible for what
happened.
	   ``They are not guilty. They have done nothing but they bear the
brunt of sanctions,'' she said.
	   Iraq has often used such processions to win world sympathy and
support for the lifting of sanctions.
	   The sanctions on Iraq, imposed after it invaded Kuwait in 1990,
will only be lifted when U.N. weapons inspectors testify that
Baghdad has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein and his top
advisers decided Tuesday to delay a decision on resuming
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors, the official Iraqi News
Agency reported.
	   INA said the decision came at a meeting chaired by Saddam of the
Revolutionary Command Council and the regional command of the Baath
party.
	   The Iraqi leaders heard a report from Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy
prime minister, who returned to Baghdad after a series of meetings
in New York with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   ``It was decided during the meeting to resume the discussion of
these issues in a forthcoming meeting,'' INA said. It did not say
when the next meeting would be.
	   The meeting here came as top U.N. weapons inspectors briefed the
U.N. Security Council on the stalled arms inspections and U.N.
efforts to determine whether Iraq loaded VX nerve gas into missile
warheads.
	   Earlier in the day, some 25,000 Iraqi women marched through the
streets of Baghdad in a government-organized demonstration to
express their anger at U.N. trade sanctions.
	   It was the largest women's protest in Baghdad since the
sanctions were imposed on Iraq in 1990 to punish it for invading
Kuwait.
	   Iraq and the United Nations have been at odds over U.N. weapons
inspections, which were mandated by U.N. resolutions following the
1991 Gulf War, which ended Iraq's seven-month occupation of Kuwait.
	   Iraq on Aug. 5 announced that it was suspending cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors. The U.N. Security Council retaliated by
canceling its regular reviews of the trade sanctions.
	   The sanctions limit Iraq's sale of oil, its economic mainstay.
The Security Council has said they cannot be lifted until the
inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The Iraqi agency said that at Tuesday's meeting, Saddam and his
aides discussed ``the flagrant American interference during the
latest period in Iraq's domestic affairs.''
	   The leadership was particularly angry at a decision by the U.S.
Congress to channel up to dlrs 97 million in military aid to
opposition groups seeking to topple the Baghdad government, INA
said.
	   The legislation also provides dlrs 2 million to fund Radio Free
Iraq to broadcast anti-government propaganda.
	   The leadership termed as ``flagrant interference'' in its
national sovereignty meetings by U.S. officials with Kurdish
leaders. The talks were aimed at ending infighting among the Kurds,
who have set up a semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq.
	   The Iraqi leadership also lashed out at U.N. weapons inspectors
for allegedly giving Israel ``sensitive and basic information on
Iraq's security and its armed forces.''
	   It was a reference to disclosures by Scott Ritter, a U.N.
inspector who resigned in August, that he received help from Israel
in the search for banned weapons in Iraq.
	   During the morning demonstration, the women protesters carried
anti-American placards and shouted slogans against the U.S.
government.
	   ``America is the enemy of God,'' they screamed as they
approached the offices of the U.N. Development Program in Baghdad,
where the organizers handed a letter of protest.
	   Most of the women were clothed in black veils and many slapped
their faces and beat their breasts at the sight of cars carrying
symbolic coffins of children.
	   Authorities say thousands of children have died because of
medicine shortages caused by the sanctions.
	   Iraq has often used such processions to try to world backing for
lifting the sanctions.

Russia to send parliamentary delegation to Kosovo

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Foreign Ministry welcomed the apparent
breakthrough in the Kosovo crisis on Tuesday, while the Defense
Ministry said Russia would give Yugoslavia military help if NATO
went ahead with airstrikes.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said Russia would
probably take part in an international observation force put
together by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
	   ``It is now time to work out and coordinate the mandate'' of the
force, Rakhmanin said, welcoming an agreement mediated by U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   The agreement at least temporarily averts NATO airstrikes and
calls for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his
forces from Kosovo, begin peace negotiations and allow the
international observers into the troubled province.
	   ``A turning point has been reached. It makes no sense to discuss
the use of force now,'' a top Foreign Ministry official, Vladimir
Chizhov, was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   The six-nation Contact Group will meet later this week to
discuss further steps to bring peace in Kosovo, Chizhov said.
	   But the Defense Ministry nevertheless issued a statement warning
``Russia will provide military and military-technical aid to
Yugoslavia,'' Interfax reported.
	   The ministry also warned that if there were airstrikes, Russia
would be unlikely to ratify the START II nuclear arms reduction
treaty with the United States and will have ``to look for possible
(new) military allies to preserve the military balance.''
	   The statement said Russia would also likely respond by revising
its relationship with NATO, including its participation in the
Partnership for Peace program.
	   Responding to threats from the Russian military to break the
arms embargo against Yugoslavia, President Boris Yeltsin's
spokesman said it was up to the Russian leader to make foreign
policy. Yeltsin is at home sick this week, recovering from a
respiratory infection.
	   Russia opposes NATO airstrikes against Serbia, which makes up
most of present-day Yugoslavia. Russia and Serbia are allies, both
being Slavic countries that practice the Orthodox Christian
religion.
	   St. Petersburg governor Vladimir Yakovlev echoed the views of
many Russians when he said Tuesday that NATO must not be ``turned
into a police agency that will make decisions on the situation in
one region or another.''
	   ``Or else it will intervene in our internal affairs, too,''
Yakovlev said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov declared Tuesday that ``an
attack on Yugoslavia is a direct threat to the interests of the
Russian Federation,'' ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Zyuganov also criticized media reports about possibly airstrikes
against Yugoslavia ``as if some rabbits, not human beings, live
there.''
	   Meanwhile, the Russian parliament voted Tuesday to send a
delegation to Kosovo. The four-member delegation will leave
Thursday to study the situation in Kosovo and visit ``a number of
sites'' that NATO was likely to target, said Sergei Baburin, the
deputy speaker of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament,
who will lead the expedition.
	   Russia's Movement for Support of the Armed Forces, a political
group formed to push for Yeltsin's ouster, said it was ready to
send its members to Yugoslavia to organize resistance to NATO. It
also hinted at acts of resistance in Russia itself.
	   ``In view of the growing anti-NATO and anti-American mood in
Russia, it is impossible to guarantee that no hostile acts will be
carried out against diplomats and other representatives of NATO
member states working in Moscow,'' said Viktor Ilyukhin, who leads
the movement as well as parliament's security committee.

	   ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) _ Balkan leaders Monday united to forge a
consensus on Kosovo, but failed to pound out any agreement on many
of the age-old differences that make their region one of the most
turbulent in the world.
	   ``Southeastern Europe is known as a region characterized by
instability, tension, turmoil and war,'' said Greek Premier Costas
Simitis at the end of the two-day summit.
	   In a rare breakdown of the everyday mistrust that colors their
relations, Simitis and Turkish Premier Mesut Yilmaz combined forces
to bend the Yugoslav delegation into accepting a reference to the
Albanian-dominated province of Kosovo in the joint statement issued
at the end of the meeting.
	   ``We were able to sit at the same table as Yugoslavia and reach
an agreement on the statement,'' a happy Yilmaz said. The action
saved the second annual summit for Turkey and salvaged the regional
initiative for Greece, which first gave it flesh on the Greek
island of Crete last year.
	   Albanian Foreign Minister Pascal Milo wasn't happy about it,
arguing that he was pressured into accepting a diluted reference to
Kosovo and told a joint news conference it should have been
replaced with a call for air strikes.
	   Yugoslav Premier Momir Bulatovic, who had to listen to his
neighbors criticism for two days, glared at Milo and said ``events
in Kosovo can bring grave consequences to the countries in the
region.''
	   Turkey's choice of Antalya was a reflection of the Balkan
tensions buried just beneath its surface. Founded by 4,000 years
ago by the Greek king Attalus II, it was part of successive Roman,
Byzantine and Ottoman empires, which spanned the Balkans and sowed
many of its present day disputes.
	   Leaders from Bulgaria, Macedonia and Romania, who all have
serious regional disagreements among themselves and other
participants, tried to inject a positive note by pointing out that
they all agreed to set up a Balkan trade center in Turkey and have
another summit next year. That summit will be held on the Romanian
Black Sea port of Constanza.
	   ``This meeting was a great success. It demonstrated the
participating countries' willingness to be in a state of wider
cooperation,'' said Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile.
	   But willingness was about all that was prevalent at the summit,
nearly wrecked by arguments between Albanians and Yugoslavs. It
also saw no progress on war-divided Cyprus and the Aegean Sea,
issues which could still easily push NATO allies to war. They have
nearly fought three times over both in the past 24 years, and any
conflict between the two regional economic and military powerhouses
would make a sideshow of Kosovo.
	   Yilmaz and Simitis failed to translate their cooperation on
Kosovo into progress on such problems as the Russian-made S-300
missiles that Greek Cypriots plan to deploy next month. Ankara,
which has more than 30,000 troops in a northern Turkish Cypriot
breakaway state, has said it may use force to stop their
installation in the Greek Cypriot south. Athens says that would
directly lead to a Greco-Turkish war.
	   ``We do agree that tensions should not increase and measures
should be taken to introduce moderation,'' Yilmaz said. But neither
Turkey nor Greece agreed here on what to talk about, with Ankara
arguing there are many issues to negotiate, and Athens insisting
the only problem that exists between them is the delineation of the
Aegean's continental shelf.
	   ``Life doesn't have any sudden changes,'' Simitis quipped.

Egyptian court dismisses case against peace group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An court on Tuesday dismissed a case by a
lawyer seeking to shut down the first Egyptian peace group working
for improved ties with Israelis, police said.
	   The Cairo Peace Movement, which was launched by a group of
Egyptian intellectuals in April, has about 120 members, including
journalists, lawyers and former diplomats. The group has criticized
the government of Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which
it says has been blocking efforts to achieve peace.
	   The court said that Mamdouh Nakhla, the lawyer who filed the
case, had no direct interest in the issue and that his petition to
the court was therefore invalid, police said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Nakhla had argued that Egyptian law does not allow groups set up
as associations to promote political issues.
	   Egypt in 1979 became the first Arab state to sign a peace
agreement with Israel.
	   Relations, however, have been cool.
	   Until recently, Egyptians couldn't travel to Israel except with
a special permit. There has been a virtual boycott in Egyptian
media of Israeli officials.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with first hooligans intercepted in Belgium; adds
detail on 1977 incidents. &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ The English are coming and just about everyone
in uniform in this tiny Grand Duchy is on high alert.
	   The national soccer team faces a tough challenge in Wednesday's
Euro 2000 qualifier but so do the police, the army and custom
controllers. Neighboring countries are also helping out.
	   The first known hooligans were detained in Belgium Tuesday and
sent back to England after they tried to get through Brussels
international airport on their way to Luxembourg, police officials
said.
	   ``There were some 20 of them and they were on special lists we
had to watch out for,'' said a police official, who demanded
anonymity.
	   Twice over the past quarter century, English hooligans have run
wild through the streets of the capital or in the Josy Barthel
stadium, smashing storefront windows, overturning cars and setting
fires.
	   This year, wherever the English played during the World Cup, a
trail of destruction was left in their wake.
	   Violence also marred their match against Sweden last month, the
last time England played abroad.
	   Little wonder there is a sense of anxiety on Rue Haute, the main
commercial drag of Luxembourg, a country of 400,000 people
surrounded by France, Belgium and Germany.
	   ``We don't know what will come,'' police Commissioner Norbert
Lepage said.
	   ``The only thing that we know is that hooligans will be among
them,'' fellow officer Lt. Col. Pierre Reuland added.
	   England is expected to bring about 2,500 fans to the
8,200-capacity Barthel Stadium, and _ in a nation with only 1,000
police officers _ the potential for trouble is clear. Enough to
call on the army to reinforce security.
	   The fans too won't be in the most upbeat mood after England lost
its first Euro 2000 game in Sweden, and played poorly in a
scoreless draw at Wembley against Bulgaria on Saturday. A slip-up
against the amateurs from Luxembourg would have a devastating
effect.
	   Fears are the English fans could take it out on the town.
	   ``People have been informed and will take precautions,'' Reuland
said. Some shops will close early on Wednesday to avoid any risk.
	   Previous hooligan riots are still burning in the minds of many
here, especially the violence of 1977 when English fans rampaged
despite a 4-0 victory in another European qualifier.
	   The English fans tore through the main shopping streets,
breaking windows, overturning cars and setting small fires to trash
cans.
	   ``It was like a war here,'' said Lepage. ``They destroyed just
about everything in sight. It's a long time ago but people
remember.''
	   The town mayor even suggested Luxembourg withdraw if it ever
drew England again.
	   At the time of the riot, international hooliganism was still in
its infancy and police had no clue how to tackle it.
	   Much has changed since.
	   ``This is a new era. Now we have communications with each
other.'' British police is sending a half dozen spotters and there
is contact with colleagues in France, Belgium and the Netherlands,
since many English fans will come through their ports.
	   Even the customs control officers have been put on alert.
Diplomats driving here for European Union meetings were warned they
could face stiffer border controls as Luxembourg wants to leave
nothing to chance.
	   Most of the fans are expected to arrive early Wednesday and with
the 8:30 p.m. (1830GMT) kickoff time, fans will have plenty of time
to try out the local drinking establishments. There is no planned
ban on alcohol sales.
	   After the match, the fans who came by train will have to sit out
the night in Luxembourg since no rail transport will be available
until the morning.

Swaziland security forces raid homes of opposition figures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ Security forces raided the homes of
several opposition leaders Tuesday, three days before the kingdom
of Swaziland holds parliamentary elections.
	   Police spokeswoman Leckina Magagula described the early-morning
raids as routine crime-fighting efforts. But one opposition leader
whose home was raided saw a political motive.
	   ``They don't like what we're saying about the elections,'' said
Mario Masuku, president of the People's United Democratic Movement.
	   Masuku's group calls the elections meaningless because only
candidates approved by the monarchy can run. Political parties have
been banned since 1973 in Swaziland, which is ruled by King Mswati
III.
	   Masuku said about 50 armed police and soldiers arrived at his
home in a dozen trucks as he prepared to take his children to
school.
	   ``They said they wanted to search my home for subversive
items,'' Masuku recounted in a telephone interview.
	   They spent 40 minutes searching his home but found no
contraband, Masuku added.
	   Voters on Friday are to choose 55 members of parliament's lower
house. The king appoints the remaining 10 members.
	   He also appoints 20 members to parliament's upper house, with
the lower house appointing the remaining 10 members.
	   The Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions has also criticized the
election. Many union members plan a boycott.
	   The raids come on the heels of an upheaval in Lesotho, another
kingdom located within South Africa's borders.
	   On Sept. 22, South African troops entered Lesotho to quell an
army mutiny and other unrest linked to recent elections which the
opposition claims were rigged.
	   The intervention resulted in firefights between South African
and Lesotho troops and a looting and arson spree. Scores died.
	   Mindful of that, Masuku said his group doesn't want to incite
violence Friday.
	   ``I think people will stay in their homes,'' Masuku said. ``We
have all said we want democratization and transformation, but we
don't want bloodshed.''

Last minute talks with Generali fail, prize to be withheld

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A last ditch effort by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's office failed Tuesday to reach a compromise with
Italian insurance giant Generali Tuesday over the publication of
information on World War II-era policies, the premier's advisor
said.
	   As a result, Israel will withdraw an award it planned to present
to Assicurazioni Generali at an international business conference
this week in Jerusalem, said Bobby Brown, Netanyahu's adviser on
Diaspora affairs.
	   The company's chairman, Antoine Bernheim, was among dozens of
international business leaders who was to receive the ``Jubilee
Award'' on Thursday for contributing to the Israeli economy.
Generali spent dlrs 320 million in 1997 to acquire a majority
position in Migdal, an Israeli insurance company.
	   ``We are quite surprised and disappointed,'' said I.A.
Ben-Porath, a lawyer for Generali in Israel who was involved in the
negotiations.
	   Generali, which reneged recently on an agreement to pay dlrs 100
million to policyholders and their heirs, has come under increased
criticism for not making public information on wartime policies.
	   Brown said Generali had offered to provide some names but not
detailed information of policyholders including maiden names,
beneficiaries and occupations, which would make it easier for heirs
to identify.
	   ``We didn't feel that was a commitment we could live with,''
Brown told The Associated Press.
	   Earlier this year, Generali provided information on war-era
policies to Israel's Holocaust memorial, but only on condition that
the information be used for the museum's research and not for
publication. The Yad Vashem museum has said from the information,
they have ascertained that Generali sold life insurance policies to
over 100,000 Jews on the eve of the Nazi Holocaust.
	   Ben-Porath said Generali has already committed to releasing
policy information to an international commission that will
investigate Holocaust insurance claims. That commission will meet
for the first time on Oct. 21 in New York.
	   But Brown said there was no guarantee that the commission would
require Generali to make a full disclosure of the details. Brown
said he would like to see the information on Generali's 337,000
wartime policies published in newspapers and the Internet.

England, coach Hoddle under pressure against tiny Luxembourg
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Soccer-Luxembourg-English Fear &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUXEMBOURG (AP) _ It's a game England might find hard to lose,
but then again, coach Glenn Hoddle already has worked himself in a
no-win situation when his squad plays the part-timers of Luxembourg
in a Euro 2000 qualifier Wednesday.
	   Hoddle's job and England's qualification for the European
Championship are on the line after two pitiful performances left
England with just one point out of two games. Poland leads Group
Five with a maximum six points while Sweden has three.
	   If England thrashes Luxembourg by a huge margin and it will be
considered an obvious result. Anything less will heap even more
pressure and abuse on the embattled coach.
	   ``When you don't start well, then the pressure to win matches
increases,'' Hoddle said ahead of Wednesday's game.
	   That is especially true after the dull goalless draw against
Bulgaria over the weekend, which has critics calling for his job.
	   ``If we don't win matches then we've certainly got problems but
we'll face that as and when it comes,'' he said.
	   Now, in a twist of irony, he is counting on the return of David
Beckham to spur a revival, four months after the Manchester United
playmaker was widely blamed for helping England out of the World
Cup with his red card against Argentina in the second round.
	   He was suspended two games for kicking an opponent and returns
against Luxembourg. It was supposed to be the easiest of tasks. Now
it is fraught with danger.
	   ``When he puts on the England shirt again he's going to be extra
determined after what happened in the World Cup,'' Hoddle said.
	   His skills are a key aspect missing in England's game: the
ability to split the defense with a single touch of the ball.
	   Beckham may return but Hoddle has other problems, too. Jamie
Redknapp and Paul Ince are both suspended and several other players
face late fitness tests.
	   Luxembourg is missing its captain and central defender Marc
Birssens, who was sent off in the weekend 3-0 loss to Poland.
	   And even though its record falls woefully short of England's _
the last four matches amount to a 20-0 goal difference in England's
favor _ Luxembourg can provide a surprise. It has beaten the Czech
Republic and came stunningly close to gaining a draw against then
World Champion Germany, losing 3-2 in 1990.
	   Hoddle needs no warnings.
	   He already has seen France slump to a 1-1 draw in Iceland and
Cyprus beat Spain this fall.
	   ``You can come unstuck in any game of soccer,'' Hoddle said.

Finding 2,000 observers may take some time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with quotes from OSCE chairman &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Despite the rush to implement the Kosovo
accord, officials admitted Tuesday it could take weeks before the
full complement of 2,000 international observers is on the ground
to make sure Slobodan Milosevic is living up to the agreement.
	   Milosevic's acceptance of the ``verification mission'' -- both
NATO aerial reconnaissance flights and the monitors on the ground
-- was a key concession in talks between the Yugoslav president and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to defuse the Kosovo crisis and avoid
NATO airstrikes.
	   ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' Holbrooke insisted
Tuesday in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade. ``They are compliance
verifiers. They will be stationed with Yugoslav government's full
support ... security guarantees and freedom of movement.''
	   President Clinton also underscored the importance of the
mission, saying ``we will not rely on what President Milosevic
says, but what he does for the whole world to see.''
	   He said allowing the international inspectors unfettered access
_ including unrestricted surveillance by NATO aircraft -- was a
test Milosevic must pass in the next four days to avoid military
strikes.
	   But the Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe, which is responsible for the ground component, lacks a
large permanent staff. It will have to turn to its 54 member
states, including the United States, Russia, Canada and European
Union countries, to provide people with the proper training and
skills for the job.
	   ``We are still in the very early planning stage,'' OSCE
spokesman Mons Nyberg said. ``Over the coming weeks, we hope to see
the mission fully activated down there.''
	   The current chairman of the OSCE, Polish Foreignm Minister
Bronislaw Geremek, said he was expecting formal offers from
contributing countries next week.
	   Geremek, speaking to reporters in Stockholm, Sweden, noted that
the Kosovo operation will be the largest ever undertaken by the
organization. ``It's a question of the future of the OSCE,'' he
said. ``It will give proof that the OSCE has a place in the
international structures.''
	   As a stopgap measure, OSCE officials plan to use the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, which was activated July 6 under
arrangement worked out between Milosevic and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin.
	   For the past four months, members of the mission -- Americans,
Canadians, Russians and Western Europeans -- have been traveling
around Kosovo, providing their governments with first-hand reports
on the fighting and the suffering of the nearly 300,000 refugees
driven from their homes.
	   But the diplomatic mission numbered only about 50 people. They
were all evacuated this week to neighboring Macedonia, largely
because of fears of reprisals by angry Serbs if NATO launched air
attacks.
	   Under the agreement with Holbrooke, Milosevic promised to
guarantee the safety of the verification mission.
	   Meantime, representatives of the 54 OSCE member states will meet
Thursday in Vienna to give their formal approval for the
verification mission. Geremek will then fly to Belgrade to sign the
agreement with Milosevic to establish the mission.

Designated economics minister declines dropping EU affair job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Jost Stollmann, designated economics
minister in Germany's new coalition government, has rejected a
proposal the office give up its responsibility for European Union
affairs to the finance ministry.
	   The chairman of the leftist Social Democrats, Oskar Lafontaine,
who is chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder's designated finance
minister, made the proposal last week that he also take over EU
affairs job to expand the ministry's influence.
	   But Stollmann, an independent computer entrepreneur without
political affiliation, said ``I have a very firm opinion on that. I
would take over the economics ministry only as it is now.''
	   The Social Democrats are in the process of negotiating a
coalition government with the environmental Greens party, and
Schroeder is expected to name his cabinet when talks wind up this
weekend.

European Central Bank chief sees no need to lower key interest

interest rate and political pressures. No pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The head of the new European Central
Bank said Tuesday that there was no need to lower key interest
rates worldwide in an attempt to correct global financial turmoil.
	   European Central Bank chief Wim Duisenberg, who heads the
powerful body setting financial policy for the single European
currency to be launched Jan. 1, said dropping interest rates would
compound uncertainties underlying the market volatility.
	   ``Recent calls for worldwide, uniform interest rate reductions
are inappropriate as they do not address the very nature of the
problems,'' said Duisenberg, the former Dutch central banker.
	   Duisenberg also warned against simplistic ``proposals inspired
by policy activism.''
	   Rather, he said, the world financial system needed structural
improvements such as enhancing transparency in the public and
private sectors, strengthening domestic banking systems, especially
in emerging market economies, and improving financial crisis
prevention and management.
	   Duisenberg heads the ECB's governing council, which met Tuesday
to discuss merging financial polices ahead of the common currency's
launch.
	   Among the tasks ahead for the council _ comprised of central
bankers from the 11 nations adopting the single currency, or euro _
is setting a single European interest rate before the launch, which
will bring down rates in most countries in any case.
	   The bankers are expected to set Europe's unified interest rate
to match Germany's core rate of 3.3 percent, and about half of the
countries launching the euro have rates higher than that.
	   Duisenberg refused to say what the Europe-wide rate will be,
saying that would be decided ``when we get there.''
	   But he said current average rates across Europe were 3.8
percent, and that was ``appropriate.''
	   Speculation about a possible rate reduction has grown since the
United States cut its rate last week.
	   Germany's incoming finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, for one,
wants rates cut to stimulate growth, although Germany's central
banker, Hans Tietmeyer, on Monday called for a steady German rate.
	   Such comments by Lafontaine have raised concerns that Germany's
Social Democrats, who will form a government at the end of October,
will try to exert political influence on the new bank, which is
modeled closely on Germany's own Bundesbank.
	   Lafontaine, the Social Democratic party leader, has made clear
his desire for a political counterweight to the European Central
Bank.
	   Duisenberg admitted pressures on the bank were growing.
	   ``I do not deny it. But it's a pressure against a strong
institution,'' he said. If anyone tried to politicize the bank's
decisions, he said they would have first to change the law as
provided in the 1992 Maastricht treaty.
	   Analysts also say the bank is likely to resist any pressures,
though some say greater political influence could begin next July,
when the term of Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer expires and
the Social Democratic-led government will choose a replacement.
	   Tietmeyer sits on the European Central Bank's governing council,
and his deputy, Otmar Issing, is a member of the bank's six-member
executive board.

Russia cancels telephone holding company auction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government has canceled plans to auction a
stake in the telephone holding company Svyazinvest because poor
market conditions have scared away prospective buyers, the Interfax
news agency reported Tuesday.
	   The sale of a stake of 25 percent, minus two shares, was to be a
big source of revenue for the government's budget this year.
	   The sale has been delayed repeatedly because of lack of
interest. Lately, the government was rumored to be postponing the
sale until next year because of Russia's financial crisis.
	   First Deputy Premier Yuri Maslyukov said the government needed
to cancel the sale because the current offers for the stake were
too low.
	   The government had already been forced to lower its minimum
price for the stake, and was adjusting the price once again.
	   While the new price had not been announced, it was to be lower
than the dlrs 1.04 billion that the government had hoped to obtain
in an auction originally set for Oct. 13.

<TEXT>
	   SAN REMO, Italy (AP) _ Tommi Makinen, the defending world
champion, padded his lead by nearly 25 seconds Tuesday in the
second leg of the San Remo Rally, while rival Colin McRae surged
into third place.
	   Makinen steered his Mitsubishi over the 583.84 kilometers (362
miles), including 10 special stages, in 1 hour, 58 minutes, 41.7
seconds. Heading into Wednesday's third and final leg, the Finn's
overall time of 3:21:37.3 put him 28.5 seconds clear of Italy's
Piero Liatti of the Subaru team.
	   The day's biggest move came from Britain's McRae, who was in
ninth place after the first leg. He still trails Makinen by 1:22.3.
Overall season standings leader Carlos Sainz stood fourth, another
10 seconds back.
	   Sainz, a Spaniard with Toyota, came to San Remo with 47
standings points, leading both Makinen and McRae by nine.
	   Juha Kankkunen, a four-time world champion, and France's Didier
Auriol, who had held third place after the first leg, dropped out
Tuesday after separate one-car accidents. Neither was seriously
injured.
	   Finland's Kankkunen, driving a Ford, crashed during the day's
fifth special stage. Toyota driver Auriol went off the road and
struck a rock during the the third stage, damaging his suspension
and driveshaft.

UN sending its own verification team to Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout to UPDATE with UN sending in mission; Russia
saying agreement proves diplomacy better than force. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations is planning to send its
own mission to Kosovo to verify compliance with U.N. resolutions
demanding an end to hostilities and a negotiated settlement between
Serbs and ethnic Albanians, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Details of the U.N. mission were sketchy. Spokesman Fred Eckhard
said only that the U.N. chief would be sending a mission to the
region ``in the coming days.''
	   The Security Council last week asked Secretary-General Kofi
Annan for such a mission, to enable the United Nations to have a
first-hand account of the situation on the ground. Since a Serb
crackdown on ethnic Albanians began in February, the United Nations
has relied on other organizations for information on the conflict.
Only U.N. humanitarian workers are in Kosovo.
	   The U.N. mission would be in addition to the 2,000-member
verification team agreed to in marathon talks between U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that
came amid threatened NATO attacks.
	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw his forces from Kosovo,
begin peace negotiations with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow
a team into Kosovo to verify Serb compliance with U.N. demands.
	   On Tuesday, the deputy U.S. ambassador, Peter Burleigh, said the
Security Council would probably adopt a resolution backing the
agreement _ giving it the force of international law.
	   Russia's U.N. ambassador, Sergey Lavrov _ whose country had
opposed NATO intervention _ said Tuesday the agreement ``proves
that Ambassador Holbrooke's determination to find a diplomatic
solution with the support of the Contact Group was stronger than
the threat of force.''
	   When asked if the council would want to endorse Monday's
agreement with another resolution, Burleigh said ``most probably
yes.'' He noted that the Contact Group of states, which has been
meeting regularly on Kosovo, had said last week that there would
``probably be a Security Council resolution with regard to the
verification agreement.''
	   No text of a resolution, however, has begun circulating, council
diplomats said.
	   ``The key is compliance with all of the aspects of the Security
Council resolution 1199,'' of Sept. 23, Burleigh said.
	   The Serb crackdown, launched Feb. 28, was aimed at crushing the
Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting for independence of the majority
Albanian province, which is part of the Yugoslav republic of
Serbia.
	   Hundreds have been killed in Kosovo and hundreds of thousands
more have been forced from their homes during the seven-month
operation in Kosovo, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro summoned toppled
Premier Romano Prodi to the presidential palace Tuesday,
heightening speculation Scalfaro would offer the center-left leader
a chance to get his job back.
	   Initially, Prodi had virtually ruled out a second mandate,
saying he would not lead a government that did not stick to the
tough economic measures that had cost him the support of hard-line
Communists.
	   But party members said Tuesday they had persuaded him to try
again to preside over passage of the 1999 budget.
	   Two key party leaders also indicated they were falling in line
behind a new term for Prodi.
	   Centrist leader Francesco Cossiga said he would support a Prodi
government on some conditions, including getting a say in the
selection of Cabinet ministers. Armando Cossutta, leader of a
breakaway faction of the Communist Refoundation, welcomed Prodi's
reported change of heart and said he thought Prodi would be able to
form a government.
	   Prodi's center-left coalition collapsed Friday after the
Communist Refoundation Party withdrew its support over the budget,
which it said fell short in job creation.
	   Scalfaro has been meeting with political leaders since then to
try to form a new government. Whoever does get the nod from him
would then have to prove he could command a majority in Italy's
unruly Parliament.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Italy's opposition forces, led by former
Premier Silvio Berlusconi, called for early elections _ something
few but him want.
	   ``When a government loses its majority it must give the power of
choice back to the citizens,'' Berlusconi said.
	   He later expressed disgust at what was a day of political
wrangling, declaring, ``This is a farce.''
	   Along with Prodi, Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has
been mentioned as a possible candidate for the premiership. Ciampi
would lead a government of technocrats to pass the budget and take
Italy through the Jan. 1 launch of the European common currency,
the euro.
	   Prodi's government lasted 2 1/2 years, making it the country's
second-longest serving since World War II.

	   ANTALYA, Turkey (AP) _ Balkan leaders united Tuesday to forge a
consensus on Kosovo, but failed to pound out any agreement on many
of the age-old differences that make their region one of the most
turbulent in the world.
	   ``Southeastern Europe is known as a region characterized by
instability, tension, turmoil and war,'' said Greek Premier Costas
Simitis at the end of the two-day summit.
	   In a rare breakdown of the everyday mistrust that colors their
relations, Simitis and Turkish Premier Mesut Yilmaz combined forces
to press the Yugoslav delegation into accepting a reference to the
Albanian-dominated province of Kosovo in the joint statement issued
Tuesday at the end of the meeting.
	   ``We were able to sit at the same table as Yugoslavia and reach
an agreement on the statement,'' a happy Yilmaz said. The
compromise enables Yugoslavia to remain a part of Greece's regional
initiative, which aims to increase economic and political
cooperation among the Balkan countries.
	   Albanian Foreign Minister Pascal Milo wasn't happy about it,
arguing that he was pressured into accepting a diluted reference to
Kosovo and told a joint news conference it should have been
replaced with a call for airstrikes.
	   Yugoslav Premier Momir Bulatovic, who had to listen to his
neighbors criticism for two days, glared at Milo and said ``events
in Kosovo can bring grave consequences to the countries in the
region.''
	   Turkey's choice of Antalya was a reflection of the Balkan
tensions buried just beneath its surface. Founded by 4,000 years
ago by the Greek king Attalus II, it was part of successive Roman,
Byzantine and Ottoman empires, which spanned the Balkans and sowed
many of its present day disputes.
	   Leaders from Bulgaria, Macedonia and Romania, who all have
serious regional disagreements among themselves and other
participants, tried to inject a positive note by pointing out that
they all agreed to set up a Balkan trade center in Turkey and have
another summit next year. That summit will be held on the Romanian
Black Sea port of Constanza.
	   ``This meeting was a great success. It demonstrated the
participating countries' willingness to be in a state of wider
cooperation,'' said Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile.
	   But willingness was about all that was prevalent at the summit,
nearly wrecked by arguments between Albanians and Yugoslavs. It
also saw no progress on war-divided Cyprus and the Aegean Sea,
issues which could still easily push NATO allies to war. They have
nearly fought three times over both in the past 24 years, and any
conflict between the two regional economic and military powerhouses
would make a sideshow of Kosovo.
	   Yilmaz and Simitis failed to translate their cooperation on
Kosovo into progress on such problems as the Russian-made S-300
missiles that Greek Cypriots plan to deploy next month. Ankara,
which has more than 30,000 troops in a northern Turkish Cypriot
breakaway state, has said it may use force to stop their
installation in the Greek Cypriot south. Athens says that would
directly lead to a Greco-Turkish war.
	   ``We do agree that tensions should not increase and measures
should be taken to introduce moderation,'' Yilmaz said. But neither
Turkey nor Greece agreed here on what to talk about, with Ankara
arguing there are many issues to negotiate, and Athens insisting
the only problem that exists between them is the delineation of the
Aegean's continental shelf.
	   ``Life doesn't have any sudden changes,'' Simitis quipped.

Russia arrests 38 drug traffickers in 24 hours
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police across Russia arrested 38 people for drug
trafficking in one 24-hour span, a news agency reported.
	   Police seized a total of 465 kilograms (1020 pounds) of heroin,
517 kilograms (1100 pounds) of opium and 20 kilograms (44 pounds)
of marijuana in the arrests Monday and Tuesday, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   More than 2 million Russians use drugs regularly, according to
official estimates. The government has said that income from the
illegal drug trade in Russia exceeds dlrs 1.5 billion.
	   Meanwhile, Russian officials in Russia's Stavropol region near
the northern Caucasus report seizing 1.8 million bottles of bootleg
vodka along local roads since the start of the year, ITAR-Tass said
Tuesday.
	   Unidentified sources in the Stavropol prosecutor's office said
the bottles, brought north from republics in the Caucasus, are
adorned with labels of popular vodka brands but often contain
liquids that are poisonous.
	   Hundreds of people across Russia died last year after drinking
concoctions passed off as vodka. According to the government, more
than half of the 2.1 billion bottles of vodka consumed by Russians
last year was produced illegally.

Council overturns legislation to segregate medical services
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iran's Guardian Council on Tuesday rejected
legislation considered by the parliament that would have required
separate medical facilities for men and women.
	   The council ruled that the proposal ``would result in an
increase in public expenditure,'' a move it said ``contravened ...
the constitution.''
	   The decision was announced on state-run Iranian television and
monitored by the London-headquartered BBC.
	   The Guardian Council, made up of six clerics and six lay
members, is responsible for checking the constitutionality of
legislation enacted by the Majlis, or parliament. It also vets
candidates for major elections, including parliament and the
presidency.

Netanyahu seeks Cabinet backing for agreement with Palestinians

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of a make-or-break Mideast summit in
Washington, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday no deal
would be signed on an Israeli troop pullback hours after an unknown
assailant fatally shot an Israeli.
	   The violence underscored the key issue of the upcoming summit _
Netanyahu's demand that the Palestinians do more to prevent terror
attacks against Israelis.
	   ``In light of this gloomy reality, there is absolutely no
chance, at this stage, of signing an agreement,'' said a statement
released by Netanyahu's office.
	   The United States wants Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to conclude an agreement on a long-overdue Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   But Netanyahu has come under increasing pressure from right-wing
members of his government and newly appointed Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon, who oppose ceding land to the Palestinians.
	   On Tuesday, Netanyahu's Cabinet formulated a list of nine
demands which the Palestinians must meet before a withdrawal can
take place and hardliners in his coalition issued a new ultimatum,
saying the premier will have to choose between staying in power and
agreeing to a West Bank withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu has said he would bring back any deal for government
and possibly parliamentary approval before a signing. But Michael
Kleiner, who represents a powerful 17-member right-wing block in
Netanyahu's coalition, said any indication that Netanyahu would
agree to a pullout, could topple his government.
	   ``To us, initialing is agreement, and that would be enough for
us to bring down the government,'' Kleiner told The Associated
Press. It was the clearest warning yet that Kleiner's colleagues
were serious about walking away from the government.
	   Netanyahu has agreed in principle to hand over 13 percent of the
West Bank, with some restrictions. The key issue to be tackled in
Washington is to work out an agreement on what constitutes a good
faith Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat many differences remained.
``There's a lot to be solved, if not here, then there (in
Washington),'' Arafat told reporters.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said the government ``is
seeking to reach an agreement with the Palestinian Authority on the
condition that it will fulfill its commitments and Israel's
security needs will be answered,'' he told reporters after the
Cabinet met.
	   The nine conditions laid out by the Cabinet for any deal include
Palestinian cooperation on security, an end to public incitement,
disarming militants and decreasing the size of the Palestinian
police force.
	   The Cabinet also said the Palestinians must remove clauses from
its charter calling for Israel's destruction, arrest and extradite
suspects in terror attacks, and fight terror.
	   The National Religious Party said it would also bring down the
government if Netanyahu reaches a deal without securing the
demands. The party, the patron of the Jewish settlement movement in
the West Bank and Gaza, has enough seats in the 120-member
parliament to rob Netanyahu of his parliamentary majority.
	   Netanyahu said he would stick to security demands during the
Washington talks. He condemned Tuesday's fatal shooting by an
unknown assailant who fired from a pistol at two Israeli men
bathing in a spring near the communal farm of Ora west of
Jerusalem. Itamar Doron, a 24 year-old student from Ora was killed
and his friend, who was not immediately identified remained in
critical condition in Jerusalem's Hadassah hospital with gunshot
wounds to the chest and stomach. The assailants' car was later
found abandoned near the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu said that if the assailant fled to Palestinian
territory, as has been the case in the past, that Arafat's
Palestinian Authority must work immediately to apprehend them.

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Three illegal Romanian immigrants
hammered nails into their heads to avoid being deported from
Croatia, a police official said Tuesday.
	   One of the men, identified as Petric V., 28, seriously injured
the inside of his skull, while his two countrymen, Mihail G., 22,
and Ionel A., 20, suffered minor injuries.
	   The men were placed in a detention center for aliens in a suburb
of the Croatian capital on Saturday when they illegally crossed
into Croatian territory.
	   The three men dismantled a wash basin to get to a metal pipe,
and then removed three 7-centimeter (2.5-inch) nails out of a
floorboard, according to police spokesman Zeljko Pul.
	   Pul said that cases of illegal aliens inflicting wounds upon
themselves in order to delay deportation had risen, as immigrants
believe they could escape more easily from a hospital bed.
	   In Romania, prisoners have occasionally driven nails into their
heads as an extreme form of protest. In May, three prisoners beat
nails into their heads to protest plans to separate them.

Union makes new offer as labor talks resume
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: Meetings to resumed at 2000 GMT. &QL;

 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ On the last day that a full American National
Basketball Association schedule could be preserved, owners and
players were back at the bargaining table Tuesday with the players
union submitting a new proposal.
	   The next move was up to commissioner David Stern and five team
owners, who gave no immediate indication of whether the 11th-hour
talks would hold any promise.
	   After meeting for about 2 1-2 hours, the sides adjourned until 4
p.m.
	   ``It depends upon how receptive the owners are,'' union director
Billy Hunter said as he arrived. ``We're going to try to step up
and talk about the issues they've raised. We've got a response, but
if they're inclined to wait for Dean Feerick then nothing's going
to happen.''
	   Arbitrator John Feerick, dean of Fordham Law School, is expected
rule in a week or two on a union grievance that more than 200
players with guaranteed contracts must be paid during the lockout.
	   More than a dozen players met Monday at the union's
headquarters, discussing details of the counterproposal that was
brought across the street to the site for the talks.
	   Patrick Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo, Ray Allen, Antonio Davis and
John Starks were among the players who attended the meeting. The
owners were represented by Gordon Gund (Cleveland), Les Alexander
(Houston), Abe Pollin (Washington) David Checketts (New York) and
Jerry Colangelo (Phoenix).
	   An agreement in principle had to be reached Tuesday to preserve
the 82-game season and league's perfect record of never having lost
a game because of labor strife _ an uninterrupted string of 35,001
games over 51 seasons.
	   ``In terms of reaching a deal, this is the worst we've ever
had,'' NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said. ``We've never
gotten to this point without being able to make a deal.''
	   The season is scheduled to begin Nov. 3, but it could
conceivably be pushed back a week or so to give teams about four
weeks to make trades, sign about 200 free agents and hold
abbreviated training camps.

Finding 2,000 observers for Kosovo may take time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Despite the rush to implement the Kosovo
accord, officials admitted Tuesday it could take weeks before the
full complement of 2,000 international observers is on the ground
to make sure Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is living up to
the agreement.
	   Milosevic's acceptance of the ``verification mission'' _ both
NATO aerial reconnaissance flights and the monitors on the ground _
was a key concession in talks between the Yugoslav president and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to defuse the Kosovo crisis and avoid
NATO airstrikes.
	   ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' Holbrooke insisted
Tuesday in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade. ``They are compliance
verifiers. They will be stationed with Yugoslav government's full
support ... security guarantees and freedom of movement.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton also underscored the importance of
the mission, saying ``we will not rely on what President Milosevic
says, but what he does for the whole world to see.''
	   He said allowing the international inspectors unfettered access
_ including unrestricted surveillance by NATO aircraft _ was a test
Milosevic must pass in the next four days to avoid military
strikes.
	   But the Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe, which is responsible for the ground component, lacks a
large permanent staff. It will have to turn to its 54 member
states, including the United States, Russia, Canada and European
Union countries, to provide people with the proper training and
skills for the job.
	   ``We are still in the very early planning stage,'' OSCE
spokesman Mons Nyberg said. ``Over the coming weeks, we hope to see
the mission fully activated down there.''
	   The current chairman of the OSCE, Polish Foreign Minister
Bronislaw Geremek, said he was expecting formal offers from
contributing countries next week.
	   Geremek, speaking to reporters in Stockholm, Sweden, noted that
the Kosovo operation will be the largest ever undertaken by the
organization. ``It's a question of the future of the OSCE,'' he
said. ``It will give proof that the OSCE has a place in the
international structures.''
	   As a stopgap measure, OSCE officials plan to use the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, which was activated July 6 under
arrangement worked out between Milosevic and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin.
	   For the past four months, members of the mission _ Americans,
Canadians, Russians and Western Europeans _ have been traveling
around Kosovo, providing their governments with firsthand reports
on the fighting and the suffering of the nearly 300,000 refugees
driven from their homes.
	   But the diplomatic mission numbered only about 50 people. They
were all evacuated this week to neighboring Macedonia, largely
because of fears of reprisals by angry Serbs if NATO launched air
attacks.
	   Under the agreement with Holbrooke, Milosevic promised to
guarantee the safety of the verification mission.
	   Meantime, representatives of the 54 OSCE member states will meet

	   PARIS (AP) _ In a growing show of force across France, as many
as 100,000 high school students _ lacking organization but not
enthusiasm _ took to the streets Tuesday to demand smaller classes
and better equipment.
	   Though disturbances were few on the second day of the national
protest, a 15-year-old student was killed when she was hit by a
truck. Police called it an unfortunate accident.
	   The students, who began the school year in early September, warn
they will stay out of school and continue protesting unless the
government comes up with funds to relieve overcrowded classrooms
and provide better equipment, such as computers.
	   Tuesday's marches disrupted traffic in cities from Rennes, in
northwest France, to Toulouse, in the south. The largest numbers
were in Bordeaux, where 16,000 students hit the streets, carrying
banners that read: ``Mobilization. Action for Good Conditions.''
	   Police kept a watchful eye, but there were only a few arrests.
Four students were in custody in the northeastern city of Nancy.
	   In the southwestern town of Niort, a 15-year-old girl was hit by
a truck and killed, local police said. The girl was not identified.
	   Though the protesters lack any real national organization, their
numbers were estimated Tuesday at 80,000-100,000 nationwide.
	   There were 8,000 in Rennes, 5,000 in Marseille, Grenoble and
Metz, 4,000 in Lyon and Montpellier, and smaller numbers in other
towns.
	   In the capital, though, the turnout was estimated at only 3,000
_ much smaller than the 10,000 who came out Monday, the first day
of the movement. Five students in Paris remained in custody
Tuesday.
	   Education Minister Claude Allegre, speaking in the National
Assembly, called for a better apportionment of resources, and said
he would present a plan in the Cabinet Wednesday aimed at spreading
teachers around the country in a more equitable way.
	   One teacher's union called on Tuesday for its members to show
solidarity with their protesting students.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The head of the new European Central
Bank said Tuesday that there was no need to lower key interest
rates worldwide in an attempt to correct global financial turmoil.
	   European Central Bank chief Wim Duisenberg, who heads the
powerful body setting financial policy for the single European
currency to be launched Jan. 1, said dropping interest rates would
compound uncertainties underlying the market volatility.
	   ``Recent calls for worldwide, uniform interest rate reductions
are inappropriate as they do not address the very nature of the
problems,'' said Duisenberg, the former Dutch central banker.
	   Duisenberg also warned against simplistic ``proposals inspired
by policy activism.''
	   Rather, he said, the world financial system needed structural
improvements such as enhancing transparency in the public and
private sectors, strengthening domestic banking systems, especially
in emerging market economies, and improving financial crisis
prevention and management.
	   Duisenberg ended speculation on what strategy the bank will
adopt to decide monetary policy and fulfill its primary objective
of maintaining stable prices. In a largely expected decision, he
said the ECB will use both money supply and inflation data, but
will emphasize money supply. Most banks use one or the other, and
the decision is considered a compromise.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Five scientists at universities in the
United States won the Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry on
Tuesday for work exploring the inner structure of matter. Their
research has far-reaching implications, from a new generation of
microelectronics to understanding the destruction of Earth's ozone
layer.
	   Three physicists will share the prize for discovering how
electrons can change behavior, work that could lead to further
advances in microelectronics.
	   And two researchers were named co-winners of the chemistry prize
for theoretical work on the quantum properties of molecules.
	   In each case, the winners will share the dlrs 978,000 prizes.
	   The chemistry award went to Walter Kohn of the University of
California-Santa Barbara and John Pople of Northwestern University.
	   Kohn, a 75-year-old native of Austria, has taught at U.S.
institutions since 1950. He was cited for development of
density-functional theory in the 1960s. It simplifies the
mathematical description of the bonding between atoms that make up
molecules.
	   His approach makes calculations according to an average number
of electrons located in any point, rather than trying to establish
the motion of each electron in every atom in a molecule. This
reliable model has enabled scientists to study large molecules that
previously were too complex and unwieldy to understand.
	   Kohn, a physicist, said of winning the chemistry prize: ``You
may think they made a mistake.'' The prize, he said, recognizes
that science has a ``kind of unity'' and that ``interdisciplinary
acts can be fruitful.''
	   Pople, a 72-year-old British citizen, joined the Northwestern
faculty in 1986.
	   He was cited for developing computer techniques to test the
chemical structure and details of matter. The resulting computer
program is used by thousands of universities and companies
worldwide. In the 1990s, he has refined the program to include
Kohn's density-functional theory.
	   His approach lets scientists create computer models of chemical
reactions that are difficult or impossible to recreate in the
laboratory. It has a wide range of applications, from studying
interstellar matter based on telescope measurements of its chemical
signatures and how pollutants such as freon react with the ozone
layer.
	   In medicine, researchers use Pople's quantum chemistry methods
to simulate the effects of proposed drugs to fight HIV infection.
	   ``I consider this a great honor not only for myself, but for all
the students who have worked with me over the years,'' Pople said
of winning the Nobel.

Trying to explain science prizes prompts a sort of poetry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Nobel-Sciences
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ When they're called on to explain the
Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry, scientists can show a poetic
side. Their lyricism is unlikely to win the Nobel for literature,
but it has its peculiar charm.
	   Despite their stereotype of being passionless people in sterile
laboratories, scientists can be seen as romantics, in a sense _
enraptured by their pursuits. Like a lover penning a sonnet, they
struggle for ways to express the sublime.
	   This year's physics prize sparked an especially vivid flurry of
images, as winners and observers tried to explain the importance of
``discovery of a new form of quantum fluid with fractionally
charged excitations'' to those who stared out the window during
high-school science classes.
	   Horst L. Stormer was the star bard of the three laureates,
portraying the prize-winning work in a vaguely Salvador Dali-like
landscape.
	   ``Usually in physics, the way you go about your business is you
break particles into smaller and smaller particles, like a
wristwatch that you crack open and look for smaller and smaller
pieces,'' he told The Associated Press in a telephone interview
from his office.
	   ``But here,'' he continued, ``it's like having a bunch of
billiard balls on a table, creating smaller billiard balls.''
	   Fellow laureate Robert B. Laughlin relied on the aphoristic
rather than the imagist approach.
	   ``You can chop (the universe) to pieces, or you can learn how
all the pieces fit together,'' he said. Then he added an
observation that was poetically pointed, if opaque:
	   ``The reason this is important has to do with ... why the
universe is the way it is.''
	   After the announcement of the prize at the Royal Swedish Academy
of Sciences, physics professor Mats Jonson coined an elegant phrase
as he was trying to help journalists understand what the laureates
had done in their work.
	   ``They force the electrons to move long distances without
colliding with other particles. It's like they move on a polished
ballroom floor,'' Jonson said.
	   Even the Academy itself, usually noted for describing the prize
work in impenetrable prose, had a flight of fancy. The citation
described experiments confirming the laureates' work as
``comparable to distinguishing the sound of individual hailstones
during a hailstorm.''
	   The Academy also showed a near-mystical streak for a moment. In
a perhaps-inadvertent echo of the belief that one can see the world
in a grain of sand, the Academy said ``events in a drop of quantum
fluid can afford ... profound insights.''

	   Initially, Prodi had virtually ruled out a return, saying he
would not lead a government that did not stick to the tough
economic measures that had cost him the support of hard-line
Communists.
	   ``I never changed my mind,'' he insisted after Scalfaro offered
him the job.
	   Party members said earlier they had persuaded him to try again
to preside over passage of the 1999 budget.
	   Prodi's center-left coalition collapsed Friday after the
Communist Refoundation Party withdrew its support over the budget,
which it said fell short in job creation.
	   Scalfaro has been meeting with political leaders since then to
try to form a new government.
	   Two key party leaders indicated Tuesday they were falling in
line behind a new term for Prodi.
	   Centrist leader Francesco Cossiga said he would support a Prodi
government on some conditions, including getting a say in the
selection of Cabinet ministers. Armando Cossutta, leader of a
breakaway faction of the Communist Refoundation, welcomed Prodi's
reported change of heart and said he thought Prodi would be able to
form a government.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Italy's opposition forces, led by former
Premier Silvio Berlusconi, called for early elections _ something
few but him want.

Hezbollah claims attack on Israeli patrol
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas detonated a
roadside bomb on Tuesday as an Israeli patrol was passing in
southern Lebanon, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, claimed responsibility for the
blast and said it caused ``several casualties.''
	   There was no immediate comment on the incident from Israel.
	   The remote-controlled device went off at about 6 p.m. (1500 GMT)
on a road near the Crusader-built Beaufort Castle, the security
officials said. They spoke on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The area is about 6 kilometers (4 miles) northwest of Marjayoun,
the main town in Israel's self-styled ``security zone'' in southern
Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israel's 1,500 soldiers and
their militia allies from the zone, which Israel set up in 1985 to
try to shield its northern towns against guerrilla incursions.

Portugal's Nobel literature laureate gets rapturous welcome home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A rapturous crowd chanted and cheered in
an emotional homecoming Tuesday for Nobel literature laureate Jose
Saramago.
	   Hundreds of people who gathered outside Lisbon City Hall for an
official welcoming ceremony surged forward for a glimpse of the
75-year-old writer who last week became the first Portuguese writer
to win the Nobel literature prize.
	   Saramago, who was met at Lisbon airport by Prime Minister
Antonio Guterres, walked through the crowd shaking hands and
embracing old friends.
	   ``I wasn't born for this prize,'' Saramago said in a speech,
referring to his humble upbringing in a poor rural family in the
capital.
	   ``You know me as I am, and I won't change one bit,'' he said,
apparently serving notice that he would not soften the outspoken,
leftist views that have created political enemies in his homeland.
	   After receiving the keys to the city, Saramago waved from the
19th-century City Hall's white-stone balcony to the crowd below.
	   The palace is a symbolic landmark for Lisbon and all of
Portugal: Its balcony was the site of the proclamation of the
Portuguese Republic in 1910.
	   Saramago served on the City Council after he won a seat on its
municipal assembly in 1989 elections as a Communist candidate,
though he later resigned to continue his writing career.
	   Portugal, a nation of fewer than 10 million people, was
delighted by the award which brought international recognition for
Portuguese culture.
	   Saramago was at the Frankfurt Book Fair when the Swedish Academy
announced the award. He then traveled to his home in Lanzarote, in
Spain's Canary Islands, with his Spanish wife Pilar del Rio.
	   A Portuguese Air Force plane carrying Culture Minister Manuel
Maria Carrilho flew to Lanzarote to bring Saramago to Lisbon for
two days of official celebrations.

Friends: Nigerian Nobel laureate to return home from exile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerian Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka will
return to his home country Wednesday after four years in exile,
friends of his said Tuesday.
	   A large airport welcome was being planned for the playwright's
return, said Dr. Yemi Ogunbiyi, a friend of Soyinka's.
	   Several opposition figures, including presidential candidate
Bola Ige, will be among those to welcome back Nigeria's most
prominent exile.
	   Soyinka could not be immediately reached for comment, but
friends insisted that his return _ which has been reported as
imminent a number of times over the past few weeks _ was definite.
	   Soyinka recently met in New York with Nigeria's new military
ruler, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who urged the playwright to come
back to Nigeria. Soyinka said later, though, that he still had
concerns for his safety.
	   The Nigerian junta recently dropped treason charges against
Soyinka _ charges filed last year during the rule of the late
dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha, and are believed to have been trumped
up in an attempt to silence Soyinka, a vocal critic of the Nigerian
junta.
	   At Abubakar's urging, several exiles have returned to Nigeria in
recent months. The general, who took office after the June death of
Abacha, pledges to return Nigeria to democracy and has freed many
political prisoners.
	   Soyinka, who teaches at Emory University in Atlanta, won the
1986 Nobel Prize for literature.

Entrepreneurs slash prices, cut back client gifts amid economic

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A few months ago, real estate broker Tom Dexel
took well-heeled clients out for dlrs 400 dinners to celebrate
closings. Nowadays, he more often gives out subscriptions to home
magazines _ at dlrs 25 a pop.
	   ``It's like the cold of the winter coming on,'' says Dexel, a
broker in Capitola, California, near Silicon Valley. ``I'm not
spending money like I used to. I'm preparing ... conserving.''
	   The nation's 14 million entrepreneurs and small business owners
are part of the lifeblood of the U.S. economy, the resilient
self-starters who create the jobs and wealth that fuel our
country's growth.
	   Now they're braking for trouble. As the economic crisis spreads
worldwide, more are scaling back plans for growth, cutting prices,
having trouble raising money _ or delaying buying a new family car.
	   ``We have no cushion; we're paying our bills month to month,''
laments Azriela Jaffe, a Lancaster, Pennsylvania-based writer and
consultant whose husband's job at electronics maker AMP Inc. is
threatened by the company's current layoffs. ``My husband is
driving a car with 110,000 miles (176,000 kilometers) on it.''
	   Not all small businesses are hurting. After all, inflation is
low, real wages are rising and the job market remains strong. Any
steep economic fall will occur after a robust eight-year expansion.
	   That's why Kate Bandos, jovial owner of a small book promotion
agency, isn't too worried. ``You can't drive down a road and not
see 20 help-wanted signs,'' she says. ``Even if this business fell
apart, I could go and stock shelves _ not that I'd want to.''
	   Yet a growing number of her peers are worrying, and more.
	   The nation's small business owners are more pessimistic about
the economy than at any time since 1993, according to the latest
monthly survey from the 600,000-strong National Federation of
Independent Business. Nearly 30 percent expect the economy to
weaken in the next three months, compared with 12 percent in
September last year.
	   Such pessimism can turn quickly into cautious behavior, as the
stock market's recent downfall shows and Tom Dexel, for one, is
learning fast.
	   Late last week, Dexel was poised to wrap up the dlrs 1 million
sale of a horse ranch to a buyer who was going to pay cash. On
Monday, the buyer pulled out, leaving his dlrs 50,000 deposit
behind. ``That shows how much lack of confidence there is,'' said a
disappointed Dexel.
	   Amid widespread lower earnings and sales, worries are turning to
realities for other small business owners. Ten percent of small
businesses reduced their work force last month, compared with 9
percent at the same time last year, reported the federation, which
defines small businesses as those with fewer than 500 employees.
	   An ax of a different sort fell for entrepreneur William Voss on
Aug. 4, a day when the stock market dropped 300 points.
	   That was the eve of his small organic food maker's public
offering of stock to raise dlrs 27 million. By day's end, chief
executive officer Voss knew that Natural Nutrition Group wasn't
going to raise much of anything. ``Some things are obvious,'' says
Voss.
	   The company isn't alone; only four such stock offerings were
issued in September, compared with 46 in July, according to
Securities Data Corp, which tracks the market.
	   Without the money, the 3-year-old Chicago company must scrap
half the 30 new products planned for this year, defer or reduce a
host of plans to boost sales, and brace for slower growth, says
Voss.
	   ``It's disappointing and frustrating,'' he said, adding that in
the last month, he's also had more trouble getting bank loans to
fund new projects.

Spanish coach expects tough match against Israelis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNY BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ After a horibble World Cup and followed
by an embarrassing 3-2 loss to Cyprus, Israel is not the kind of
opponent Spain and new coach Antonio Camacho need right now.
	   ``Judging by the opponents' recent results, we are going to have
a difficult game tomorrow,'' Camacho said Tuesday.
	   This will be Camacho's first non-friendly game as coach
following since taking over the Spanish national side in the wake
of the Cypriot disaster.
	   He coached Spain to a 1-0 exhibition victory over Russia on
Sept. 23 in Grenada, Spain, but Wednesday will be his first real
test.
	   It will come against a team that held Austria to a 1-1 draw in
Vienna in its opening European qualifier and routed San Marino 5-0
on Saturday to move atop Group Six.
	   Camacho dismissed claims that his players have lost their
confidence.
	   ``They are all professional, first-division footballers, and
have no reason to lack confidence in themselves,'' he said.
	   He won't say what he's changed since Cyprus.
	   ``I have given certain players specific advice during pre-match
training sessions. They know that they were responsible for what
happened in Cyprus. They are very clear and know that the have to
win tomorrow.''
	   Camacho noted that ``communication between players on the field
is important.''
	   ``They come from several clubs and it takes time to get used to
each other. It would be better if we had a month to work together,
but this would necessitate rescheduling league fixtures, and I
doubt whether our clubs would agree to this.''
	   Camacho reluctantly disclosed that he will play four midfielders
against Israel, but refused to announce his lineup.
	   ``I don't think Israel is the favorite to win, despite home
advantage and recent results,'' Camacho said.

Mitchell predicts Belfast politicians' `sincerity' will overcome
</HEADLINE>
deadlock &QL; 
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Former U.S. Sen. George
Mitchell, chairman of the successful Belfast peace negotiations,
predicted Tuesday that Northern Ireland's rival politicians would
resolve a fundamental dispute thwarting their efforts to form a new
government.
	   A Northern Ireland administration of Protestants and Catholics
is supposed to hold an inaugural summit with the Irish Republic's
government by Oct. 31, one of the few specific deadlines within
April's historic accord among eight parties.
	   But the potential 12-member administration has yet to be
appointed because two key politicians _ Ulster Unionist Party
leader David Trimble and Sinn Fein party leader Gerry Adams _ can't
agree whether the Irish Republican Army must start disarming first.
	   The agreement says only that disarmament should happen by May
2000. But Trimble, chief representative of the north's British
Protestant majority, insists the IRA must demonstrate it has
renounced violence before Adams' IRA-allied party will be eligible
to participate in the new government. Both Adams and Trimble are on
separate visits to the United States this week.
	   ``I hope and expect that they will resolve the difficulties over
the Oct. 31 deadline,'' said Mitchell, who was in Dublin to receive
an honorary degree from the city's American College _ the latest in
a long line of awards presented in honor of his 22-month
stewardship of negotiations.
	   Mitchell emphasized he was no longer ``involved on a day-to-day
basis, and so I'm not able to predict precise dates. But I know the
men and women who participated in the negotiations and reached the
agreement, and I'm convinced of their sincerity and determination
in keeping this process going.''
	   Meanwhile, Mitchell's former talks colleague pressed ahead with
his mission to secure the gradual disarmament of the IRA and two
pro-British paramilitary groups.
	   Retired Canadian Gen. John de Chastelain met secretly in Belfast
with Sinn Fein's Martin McGuinness, the party's formal liaison with
the IRA, and Billy Hutchinson, who represents the Ulster Volunteer
Force.
	   A draft of proposals from de Chastelain, leaked Tuesday to the
BBC in Belfast, revealed that he is suggesting that the IRA and UVF
destroy some of their stores of explosives first, since these can't
be considered ``defensive'' weapons.
	   The IRA is sticking to a July 1997 cease-fire but insists it
won't disarm, and Sinn Fein argues it shouldn't be responsible for
what the IRA does.
	   The UVF and the other major outlawed pro-British group, the
Ulster Defense Association, have observed a truce since 1994 but
are similarly determined to retain their less elaborate arsenal.
The UDA has refused even to appoint an official to meet de
Chastelain, who like Mitchell arrived in Belfast in 1995.

UEFA hands Hajduk Split stadium ban; England fined
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Croatia's Hajduk Split has had its
stadium suspended for one European match as punishment for its
supporters' behavior in a UEFA Cup match, European soccer's
governing body said Tuesday.
	   The incidents took place during Hajduk's first-round, second-leg
match against Fiorentina of Italy last month.
	   When it next qualifies for European competition, the club will
have to play its first home match at least 200 kilometers (125
miles) from Split, UEFA said in a statement.
	   The decision was made by UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Body,
meeting in Geneva last week.
	   The panel also fined England 60,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 45,100)
for its supporters' behavior during the team's 2-1 European
Championship qualifying defeat in Sweden.
	   In other decisions, Yugoslavia's Crvena Zvezda (Red Star
Belgrade) was fined a total of 41,000 francs (dlrs 30,800) for fans
setting off fireworks and throwing objects, as well as for improper
conduct of the team, during its UEFA Cup match at Metz of France.
	   Red Star needed to win a shootout after losing 2-1 at Metz,
which had American international David Regis sent off after 52
minutes for a late tackle on Miodrag Pantelic.
	   Regis was given a five-match suspension by the disciplinary
body, UEFA said.

	   ROME (AP) _ President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro offered toppled
Premier Romano Prodi an opportunity to get his job back Tuesday,
giving Italy's second-longest government since World War II a
chance to keep going.
	   Prodi's center-left government fell five days earlier when he
lost a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies by a single
vote. He initially appeared to rule out a return, saying he would
take the job back only if he could stick to the cost-cutting
programs that cost him the support of hard-line Communists.
	   ``I never changed my mind,'' he insisted after Scalfaro asked
him to see if he could now command a majority in Parliament. ``What
is needed is an examination of policy and an examination of the
situation in Parliament.''
	   Party members said earlier they had persuaded him to try again
to preside over passage of the 1999 budget.
	   Prodi's center-left coalition collapsed Friday after the
Communist Refoundation Party withdrew its support over the budget,
which it said fell short in job creation.
	   Scalfaro has been meeting with political leaders since then to
try to form a new government.
	   Two key leaders _ Francesco Cossiga, a centrist leader, and
Armando Cossutta, leader of a breakaway faction of the Communist
Refoundation _ indicated Tuesday they were falling in line behind a
new term for Prodi.
	   Earlier Tuesday, Italy's opposition forces, led by former
Premier Silvio Berlusconi, called for early elections _ something
few but him want.
	   ``When a government loses its majority it must give the power of
choice back to the citizens,'' Berlusconi said.
	   He later expressed disgust at what was a day of political
wrangling, declaring, ``This is a farce.''
	   Prodi had governed for 2 1/2 years, making his the country's
second-longest serving since World War II.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of his departure for a make-or-break
Mideast summit in Washington, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Tuesday no deal would be signed on an Israeli troop pullback
hours after an unknown assailant fatally shot an Israeli.
	   The violence underscored the key issue of Thursday's summit:
Netanyahu's demand that the Palestinians do more to prevent terror
attacks against Israelis.
	   ``In light of this gloomy reality, there is absolutely no
chance, at this stage, of signing an agreement,'' said a statement
released by Netanyahu's office.
	   Netanyahu has agreed in principle to hand over 13 percent of the
West Bank, with some restrictions. The United States wants
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to conclude the
agreement on the troop withdrawal.
	   But Netanyahu has come under increasing pressure from right-wing
members of his government and newly appointed Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon, who oppose ceding land to the Palestinians.
	   The key issue to be tackled in Washington is an agreement on
what constitutes a good faith Palestinian crackdown on Islamic
militants.
	   On Tuesday, Netanyahu's Cabinet formulated a list of nine
demands that the Palestinians must meet before a withdrawal can
take place.
	   They include cooperation on security, an end to public
incitement, disarming militants and decreasing the size of the
Palestinian police force. The Cabinet also said the Palestinians
must remove clauses from their charter calling for Israel's
destruction, arrest and extradite suspects in terror attacks and
fight terror.
	   Hard-liners in Netanyahu's coalition issued a new ultimatum
Tuesday, saying the premier will have to choose between staying in
power and signing a West Bank withdrawal in Washington.
	   Netanyahu said he would bring back any deal for government and
possibly parliamentary approval before a signing. But Michael
Kleiner, who represents a powerful 17-member right-wing block in
Netanyahu's coalition, said any indication that Netanyahu would
agree to a pullout could topple his government.
	   ``To us, initialing is agreement, and that would be enough for
us to bring down the government,'' Kleiner told The Associated
Press.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said the government ``is
seeking to reach an agreement with the Palestinian Authority on the
condition that it will fulfill its commitments and Israel's
security needs will be answered,'' he told reporters after the
Cabinet met.
	   The National Religious Party said it also would bring down the
government if Netanyahu reaches a deal without securing the
demands. The party, the patron of the Jewish settlement movement in
the West Bank and Gaza, has enough seats in the 120-member
parliament to rob Netanyahu of his parliamentary majority.
	   Netanyahu said he would stick to security demands during the
Washington talks. Arafat said many differences remained. ``There's
a lot to be solved, if not here, then'' in Washington, he told
reporters.
	   Netanyahu condemned Tuesday's fatal shooting of two Israeli men
bathing in a spring near the communal farm of Ora west of
Jerusalem. Itamar Doron, a 24-year-old student from Ora, was killed
and his friend, who was not identified, was in critical condition
in Jerusalem's Hadassah hospital with gunshot wounds to the chest
and stomach.
	   Netanyahu said that if the assailants fled to Palestinian
territory, as has been the case in the past, Arafat's Palestinian
Authority must work immediately to apprehend them.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ President Saddam Hussein and his top
advisers decided Tuesday to delay a decision on resuming
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors, the official Iraqi News
Agency reported.
	   INA said the decision came at a meeting chaired by Saddam of the
Revolutionary Command Council and the regional command of the Baath
party.
	   The Iraqi leaders heard a report from Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy
prime minister, who returned to Baghdad after meetings in New York
with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   ``It was decided during the meeting to resume the discussion of
these issues in a forthcoming meeting,'' INA said. It did not say
when this would be.
	   The meeting here came as top U.N. weapons inspectors briefed the
U.N. Security Council on the stalled arms inspections and U.N.
efforts to determine whether Iraq loaded VX nerve gas into missile
warheads.
	   Earlier in the day, some 25,000 Iraqi women marched through the
streets of Baghdad in a government-organized protest to express
anger at U.N. trade sanctions.
	   It was the largest women's protest in Baghdad since the
sanctions were imposed on Iraq in 1990 to punish it for invading
Kuwait.
	   Iraq and the United Nations have been at odds over U.N. weapons
inspections, which were mandated by U.N. resolutions following the
1991 Gulf War, which ended Iraq's seven-month occupation of Kuwait.
	   Iraq on Aug. 5 announced that it was suspending cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors. The U.N. Security Council retaliated by
canceling its regular reviews of the trade sanctions.
	   The sanctions limit Iraq's sale of oil, its economic mainstay.
The Security Council has said they cannot be lifted until the
inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The Iraqi agency said that at Tuesday's meeting, Saddam and his
aides discussed ``the flagrant American interference during the
latest period in Iraq's domestic affairs.''
	   The leadership was particularly angry at a decision by the U.S.
Congress to channel up to dlrs 97 million in military aid to
opposition groups seeking to topple the Baghdad government, INA
said.
	   The legislation also provides dlrs 2 million to fund Radio Free
Iraq to broadcast anti-government propaganda.
	   The leadership termed as ``flagrant interference'' in its
national sovereignty meetings by U.S. officials with Kurdish
leaders. The talks were aimed at ending infighting among the Kurds,
who have set up a semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq.
	   The Iraqi leadership also lashed out at U.N. weapons inspectors
for allegedly giving Israel ``sensitive and basic information on
Iraq's security and its armed forces.''
	   It was a reference to disclosures by Scott Ritter, a U.N.
inspector who resigned in August, that he received help from Israel
in the search for banned weapons in Iraq.
	   During the morning demonstration, the women protesters carried
anti-American placards and shouted slogans against the U.S.
government.
	   ``America is the enemy of God,'' they screamed as they
approached the offices of the U.N. Development Program in Baghdad,
where the organizers handed a letter of protest.
	   Most of the women were clothed in black veils and many slapped
their faces and beat their breasts at the sight of cars carrying
symbolic coffins of children.
	   Authorities say thousands of children have died because of
medicine shortages caused by the sanctions.
	   Iraq has often used such processions to try to get world backing
for lifting the sanctions.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Kosovo Albanians and Serbs breathed
a sigh of relief Tuesday that NATO missiles and bombs wouldn't be
exploding around them right away. But few expressed any real
optimism about the future.
	   Slate-gray skies and a steady, day-long rainfall seemed fit
accompaniment for the mood in Pristina, capital of the poor
southern province of Serbia, the dominant force in the two
remaining states of the Yugoslav Federation.
	   Mirko, 50, a Serb refugee who fled the Krajina region of Bosnia
during the three-year conflict there, was depressed about the deal
American negotiator Richard Holbrooke struck with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   ``He will sell Kosovo in the same way he sold Krajina,'' said
Mirko, who wouldn't give his last name. ``I have no idea where I'm
supposed to go now. If I have to run once again, I'll kill
myself.''
	   Stevo, a Serb pensioner in his 70s sitting at the same
restaurant table in central Pristina, said agreement was better
than bombardment.
	   Milosevic ``couldn't fight the whole world,'' said Stevo, who
gave only his first name. ``This is all an American plot. They want
to destroy small nations.''
	   Atifete Celaj, 23, an ethnic Albanian refugee driven from her
home and now living outdoors near Kishna Reka, (30 kilometers) 20
miles southwest of Pristina, said she doesn't have much faith in
the unarmed observer force that is supposed to verify Serb
compliance.
	   ``Until observers come here and give us security, and not just
any security, we are not going back home,'' she said. Milosevic
``is saying that I am going to be secure, but we don't believe him
any more.''
	   Ethnic Albanian political leaders agreed the key now was whether
Milosevic complied with the agreement.
	   ``We welcome NATO's dedication to stop the genocide in Kosovo,
but we have had very bitter experiences in the past with this
regime. So we have to wait and see if compliance is going to take
place or not,'' said Alush Gashi, foreign affairs secretary of the
ethnic Albanian LDK party.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army, the loosely organized rebel force
that has been struggling against Serbian forces since its founding
in 1996, declared a unilateral cease-fire last week. But it said in
a statement Tuesday that Serbian forces continue to shell, burn and
raid ethnic Albanian villages.
	   The statement, signed by the KLA main headquarters, called on
all political parties ``to create a government of national
salvation to lead the negotiations for the independence of
Kosovo.''
	   ``We will not accept that one party decides the fate of the
nation of Kosovo,'' the statement in Albanian said. ``The existing
group is unacceptable and we insist on their withdrawal from the
negotiations.''
	   Adem Demaci, a politician who says his views reflect those of
the KLA, said Kosovo was entering ``a new day, a new situation, new
circumstances,'' but said he couldn't guarantee the KLA cease-fire
would continue.
	   ``It is the turn of the (Serb) police and military forces to
prove'' they will also adhere to a cease-fire, he said.
	   Not surprisingly, the most optimistic note was struck by Veljko
Odalovic, the Serb governor of the Kosovo region around Pristina.
	   ``NATO and the international community are knocking on an open
door,'' he said.
	   ``There are no clashes. We are employing our utmost effort to
normalizing conditions. Displaced persons are going back to their
homes. Through humanitarian centers and other efforts we are trying
to enhance the return of life in villages which people have fled.''

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The church that formed the
religious backbone of apartheid denounced white rule as ``sinful''
Tuesday and considered integrating with its non-white counterpart.
	   The integration of the Dutch Reformed Church _ which once told
its members that biblical teachings ordained white minority rule _
would mark a big step in South Africa's march toward racial
reconciliation.
	   After gathering in the capital Tuesday for its national meeting
_ which is held only every four years _ church officials adopted a
resolution rejecting ``apartheid as wrong and sinful not simply in
its effects and operations but in its fundamental nature.''
	   ``The theological justification (of apartheid) is a travesty of
the gospel and, in its persistent disobedience to the word of God,
a theological heresy,'' the resolution said.
	   The resolution also asked for the church to be readmitted into
the World Alliance of Reformed Churches, from which it was expelled
in 1982 during apartheid.
	   Despite the strongly worded repudiation, there was resistance to
a proposal _ to be voted on Wednesday _ for the church to merge
with its non-white counterpart, the Uniting Reformed Church.
	   Some delegates said they objected because by merging, the
all-white church would then be adopting a theological creed held by
the Uniting Reformed Church which maintains that God is on the side
of the underprivileged.
	   Delegate Jacobus Gerber of Pretoria said the creed was
objectionable because of the anti-apartheid atmosphere in which it
was adopted. But he denied race was an issue.
	   ``There is no racial tension,'' he told a reporter. ``This is
not a black and white issue.''
	   However, there were unconfirmed reports that the integration
proposal has angered provincial branches and that they are
threatening to break away from the church to keep their religion
segregated.
	   Last month, the 164,000-member Free State provincial branch was
reported to have opposed the merger because it objected to
worshipping with blacks and people of mixed race.
	   Starting in 1982, the church gradually renounced its hardline
position but kept separate branches for blacks and mixed-race
congregants. In 1994, the black and mixed-race branches merged to
become the Uniting Reformed Church.

Finding 2,000 observers may take some time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with quotes from OSCE chairman &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Despite the rush to implement the Kosovo
accord, officials admitted Tuesday it could take weeks before the
full complement of 2,000 international observers is in place to
make sure Slobodan Milosevic lives up to the agreement.
	   Milosevic's acceptance of the ``verification mission'' -- both
NATO aerial reconnaissance flights and the monitors on the ground
-- was a key concession in talks between the Yugoslav president and
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to defuse the Kosovo crisis and avoid
NATO airstrikes.
	   ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' Holbrooke insisted
Tuesday in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade. ``They are compliance
verifiers. They will be stationed with the Yugoslav government's
full support ... security guarantees and freedom of movement.''
	   President Clinton also underscored the importance of the
mission, saying ``we will not rely on what President Milosevic
says, but what he does for the whole world to see.''
	   He said allowing the international inspectors' unfettered access
_ including unrestricted surveillance by NATO aircraft -- was a
test Milosevic must pass in the next four days to avoid strikes.
	   But the Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe, which is responsible for the ground component, lacks a
large permanent staff. It will have to turn to its 54 member
states, including the United States, Russia, Canada and European
Union countries, to provide people with the necessary training and
skills.
	   ``We are still in the very early planning stage,'' OSCE
spokesman Mons Nyberg said. ``Over the coming weeks, we hope to see
the mission fully activated down there.''
	   The current chairman of the OSCE, Polish Foreignm Minister
Bronislaw Geremek, said he was expecting formal offers from
contributing countries next week.
	   Geremek, speaking to reporters in Stockholm, Sweden, noted that
the Kosovo operation will be the largest ever undertaken by the
organization. ``It's a question of the future of the OSCE,'' he
said. ``It will give proof that the OSCE has a place in the
international structures.''
	   As a stopgap measure, OSCE officials plan to use the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, which was activated July 6 under
arrangement worked out between Milosevic and Russian President
Boris Yeltsin.
	   For four months, members of the mission -- Americans, Canadians,
Russians and Western Europeans -- have been traveling around
Kosovo, providing their governments with first-hand reports on the
fighting and the suffering of the nearly 300,000 refugees driven
from their homes.
	   But the diplomatic mission numbered only about 50 people. They
were all evacuated this week to neighboring Macedonia, largely
because of fears of reprisals by angry Serbs if NATO launched air
attacks.
	   Under the agreement with Holbrooke, Milosevic promised to
guarantee the safety of the verification mission.
	   Meantime, representatives of the 54 OSCE member states will meet
Thursday in Vienna to give their formal approval for the
verification mission. Geremek will then fly to Belgrade to sign the
agreement with Milosevic to establish the mission.

	   AZAWIYA, West Bank (AP) _ An explosion went off Tuesday in an
open field in the West Bank, seriously injuring a young Palestinian
man villagers said was harvesting olives.
	   The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.
	   The Israel army said two Palestinians were injured in the blast
it believes was caused by an ``explosive device,'' one of the
injured may have been playing with. The army did not specify what
type of explosive it may have been. The army said they were
investigating the incident.
	   The blast occurred in the village of Azawiya, 25 kilometers (15
miles) southwest of the West Bank town of Nablus.
	   Doctors at the local hospital in Nablus, a few kilometers
(miles) away, said a young man, who was not immediately identifed
was in critical condition from the blast and was not expected to
live through the night.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Forest fires raged for a fourth straight day in
northern and central Israel Tuesday, temporarily closing a major
highway and forcing thousands of residents to leave their homes.
	   Fires in the Carmel forests blazed out of control near the
northern port city of Haifa and residents of three nearby villages
evacuated the area, some for the second time in two days. Hundreds
of prisoners were evacuated from two large jails in the north.
	   In the Western Galilee, fire destroyed 25 acres (100 dunams) of
forest, Israel radio said.
	   Israeli fire fighters worked non-stop with little success to
quell the blazes. Three fire fighter planes from Greece were to
arrive Wednesday to help, Israel TV said.
	   In the hills near Jerusalem, fires smoldering since Monday
intensified, sending thick clouds of smoke toward the Jerusalem-Tel
Aviv highway on Tuesday and briefly forcing the closure of the
major thoroughfare.
	   Meanwhile, a court on Tuesday extended the arrest of three
Israeli Arab youths being held on suspicion of having set fire to
wilderness areas near Wadi Ara in northern Israel.
	   Earlier this month, Wadi Ara was the site of clashes between
Israeli Arabs and police over a land dispute.
	   Officials said most of the other blazes were started
accidentally by picnickers who left coals burning in the forest
while visiting during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot that ended
Monday. Unseasonably hot, dry conditions and strong winds in the
region also helped the fires to spread.

	   TULTEPEC, Mexico (AP) _ A gas explosion set off a pile of
gunpowder used to make illegal fireworks Tuesday, obliterating a
two-block area of this central Mexican town and killing at least 10
people and wounding dozens.
	   Rescuers said they expected to find more bodies as they searched
collapsed houses in Tultepec, a town 20 miles (32 kilometers) north
of Mexico City known for its homemade fireworks.
	   Angry residents, apparently fearful that the explosion would
lead to a crackdown on illegal fireworks, blocked journalists
trying to enter the affected area. They said a minor gas explosion
had occurred and that there was nothing to see.
	   But the smell of gunpowder was strong, and television images
taken from a helicopter showed a two-block section of town entirely
leveled by the blast.
	   Many blocks away, shattered glass still covered the street and
people who live as far as five kilometers (three miles) away
reported hearing the blast. A crater indicated the site of the
explosion.
	   ``It was like a bomb,'' said Alejandro Garcia, a 33-year-old
local businessman who lives six blocks away.
	   Mexico state Gov. Cesar Camacho Quiroz said at least 10 people
died _ including a 10-year-old boy _ and 27 were wounded. But a
paramedic at the scene, who spoke on customary condition of
anonymity, said he had counted 14 bodies, and that at least 45
people were injured.
	   Gen. Francisco Fernandez Solis, general director of public
safety, gave the death toll at 10 but said: ``we expect to find
more when we clear the rubble.''
	   He confirmed that the explosion was of gunpowder.
	   ``The explosion was started by a gas tank leak, which spread and
caused an explosion in products used to make fireworks,'' he said.
	   Tultepec is known for its fireworks, and many residents produce
them illegally in their homes. Residents said the explosion
occurred in the main gunpowder stockpile for all of the fireworks
factories in the area.
	   In June 1997, an explosion in a Tultepec home producing illegal
fireworks killed three people. And in December 1988, a Mexico City
marketplace where illegal fireworks were sold exploded and set off
a string of fires, killing 62 people and injuring 83.

Orthodox priest found dead in Belarus

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ A well-known Belarusian Orthodox priest
was killed and his body dumped near a highway, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported Tuesday.
	   A duty officer at the Belarusian national police headquarters
confirmed that the dead body of Father Mikhail, secretary of the
Brest-Kobrinsk diocese, was found Tuesday near a highway between
the capital Minsk and the town of Brest, 300 kilometers (186 miles)
to the west. He refused to give any more details.

Russia to send parliamentary delegation to Kosovo

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yeltsin being briefed regularly on Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Foreign Ministry welcomed the apparent
breakthrough in the Kosovo crisis on Tuesday, while the Defense
Ministry said Russia would give Yugoslavia military help if NATO
went ahead with airstrikes.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said Russia would
probably take part in an international observation force put
together by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
	   ``It is now time to work out and coordinate the mandate'' of the
force, Rakhmanin said, welcoming an agreement mediated by U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke.
	   The agreement at least temporarily averts NATO airstrikes and
calls for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to withdraw his
forces from Kosovo, begin peace negotiations and allow the
international observers into the troubled province.
	   ``A turning point has been reached. It makes no sense to discuss
the use of force now,'' a top Foreign Ministry official, Vladimir
Chizhov, was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   The six-nation Contact Group will meet later this week to
discuss further steps to bring peace in Kosovo, Chizhov said.
	   But the Defense Ministry nevertheless issued a statement warning
``Russia will provide military and military-technical aid to
Yugoslavia,'' Interfax reported.
	   The ministry also warned that if there were airstrikes, Russia
would be unlikely to ratify the START II nuclear arms reduction
treaty with the United States and will have ``to look for possible
(new) military allies to preserve the military balance.''
	   The statement said Russia would also likely respond by revising
its relationship with NATO, including its participation in the
Partnership for Peace program.
	   Responding to threats from the Russian military to break the
arms embargo against Yugoslavia, President Boris Yeltsin's
spokesman said it was up to the Russian leader to make foreign
policy. Yeltsin is at home sick this week, recovering from a
respiratory infection.
	   The deputy head of the presidential administration, Sergei
Prikhodko, told Interfax that he and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
were briefing Yeltsin regularly about the situation around Kosovo.

Official: Tehran would not oppose visit by Taliban envoy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by deputy foreign minister, EDITS to

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian official said Tuesday that Tehran
has detected a change in Afghanistan's Taliban militia and would
not oppose a visit by a Taliban representative, state-run Iranian
radio said.
	   The report quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh as
saying that ``the Taliban's behavior has changed'' as a result of
pressure from the United Nations and the international community as
well as Iran's decision to mass troops on its border with
Afghanistan.
	   Asked about the possibility of the Taliban sending an envoy to
Tehran, Aminzadeh said Iran was ``not opposed to visits by any
envoy whose objective is to free the Iranians detained by the
Taliban,'' the radio report said. The broadcast was monitored by
the BBC in London.
	   The Taliban, which now controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan,
does not have diplomatic relations with Iran and accuse it of
supporting the anti-Taliban opposition.
	   More than 60 Iranians are still believed to be in Taliban
custody, including some 30 that Iran says were drivers delivering
humanitarian aid.
	   Aminzadeh's comments came a day after 10 Iranians released by
the Taliban returned home aboard a Red Cross plane, according to
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency.
	   On Sunday, the Taliban returned the bodies of three slain
Iranian diplomats.
	   Both gestures were seen as trying to temper tensions between the
Taliban and Iran, which has massed more than 200,000 troops on its
eastern border with Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban acknowledged that renegade militiamen killed eight
Iranian diplomats and a journalist after the Taliban captured the
northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Iran had demanded the Taliban return the bodies of the Iranians
and send the killers for trial in Tehran. Six bodies were returned
earlier, but the Taliban has refused to hand over the suspected
killers.
	   Taliban leaders, who are mostly Sunni Muslims, accuse Iran of
arming and financing Afghanistan's northern-based opposition, which
includes the country's minority Shiite Muslims. Most Iranians also
are Shiite Muslims.

Penguins to declare bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN ROBINSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ The Pittsburgh Penguins were about to become
the second team in National Hockey League history to file for
bankruptcy.
	   The first team to do so was the same Penguins, whose offices
were padlocked by the IRS in 1975 after they couldn't pay their
bills. The franchise was later seized and sold to other owners.
	   The same scenario isn't likely now, even though NHL commissioner
Gary Bettman strongly opposes Penguins co-owner Roger Marino's
decision to seek bankruptcy protection to sort out the team's
finances.
	   Marino said the Penguins have lost nearly dlrs 40 million in the
20 months since he became the primary owner.
	   City councilman Dan Cohen, a member of the Auditorium Board that
oversees the Civic Arena, confirmed today that the bankruptcy
filing could come at any time. Mayor Tom Murphy also said published
reports that the bankruptcy was imminent were correct.
	   The filing would come under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code to protect the team from its creditors while it reorganizes
its finances.
	   ``Bankruptcy has been an option and continues to be an option,''
said Penguins spokesman Tom McMillan, though he said the team would
prefer to resolve its troubles out of court.
	   The filing could leave some creditors with a fraction of the
money they are owed. Among their creditors is retired star Mario
Lemieux, who only last week reached a settlement over part of the
dlrs 33 million he claims is owed in deferred payments.
	   A bankruptcy filing would not likely affect the team's
day-to-day operations. Games would be played as scheduled, and
players and staff would continue to be paid.
	   Bettman participated in a meeting last week that included
Marino, Murphy, county commissioners and a representative from SMG
Pittsburgh Inc., the private firm that operates the arena under a
lease with the city and county. They discussed the team's deep
financial problems and the possibility that it could be forced into
bankruptcy.
	   The Penguins currently face four lawsuits stemming mostly from
their financial mess, from Lemieux, SMG, cable TV sports channel
Fox Sports Pittsburgh and the agency that runs the arena. That suit
seeks an order barring any discussions about relocating the team
before its lease commitments expire in 2007.
	   Fox Sports Pittsburgh and SMG are suing for failing to make
required payments under long-term deals that were signed to cure
short-term financial crises stemming from the NHL players lockout
in 1994-95.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Anna Kournikova served up a massive
17 double-faults Tuesday, handing eighth-seed Dominique Van Roost a
straight-sets victory in the first round of the European
Championships.
	   Becoming the first Belgian man or women ever to enter the
world's top-10 rankings on Monday, an assertive Van Roost needed
just 56 minutes to dispatch the faltering Russian 6-3, 6-1.
	   ``It makes a huge difference when you know you've entered the
top-10 and you've beaten some really great players,'' said Van
Roost, who ended Martina Hingis's reign as world No. 1 when she
toppled the Swiss in the quarterfinals in Filderstadt last week.
	   ``It made a huge difference on my side and on the other side
because she knew it, too.''
	   Van Roost showed only a momentary lapse in the first set,
allowing Kournikova to break and go up 3-2. But the Belgian
displayed the same determination which allowed her to defeat
Hingis, winning the next four games to take the set.
	   Struggling with her service game, the 17-year-old Russian
labored in the second set to retain her opening serve, before
losing her next three and literally handing Van Roost the win.
	   ``I think she was nervous and under pressure,'' said Van Roost.
``She's probably the most famous player at the moment, even more
than Martina.
	   ``With people around her all the time, being in every newspaper,
being the the star, she has to win a tournament. She needs to prove
she's deserving of her status.''
	   Van Roost was quick to acknowledge Kournikova had talent and
predicted the Russian would be back in the top-10 before long.
	   Kournikova, who fell out of the top-10 after tearing ligaments
in her right thumb in a fall in Eastbourne, is currently ranked
12th in the world. She has not lost to anyone ranked outside the
world's top-15 since the start of 1997.
	   ``I was a bit nervous but I'm not feeling pressure from
anybody,'' denied Kournikova, who repeatedly looked over to her
coach Pavel Slozil after losing a point. ``I was just getting
uptight as the match went on.''
	   With Hingis withdrawing due to an ankle injury, it was
fifth-seed Patty Schnyder who kept the Swiss crowd happy, beginning
her campaign with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Italy's Silvia Farina.
	   Schnyder, who needed just 54 minutes to dispose of the Italian,
won five titles this season and reached the final of the Grand Slam
Cup before losing to Venus Williams.
	   American qualifier Corina Morariu posted a 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 win
over France's Sandrine Testud, who beat out Lindsay Daveport in the
final of Filderstadt on Sunday.
	   Sixth-seed Amanda Coetzer advanced to the second round with a
7-5, 6-4 win over Natascha Zvereva of Belarus.
	   American Lisa Raymond, who reached the semifinals last year
after upsetting Hingis in the quarterfinals, advanced to the second
round with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over lucky-loser Catalina Cristea of
Romania.
	   Wednesday, new world No. 1 Davenport begins the defence of her
crown with a second round match against French qualifier Julie
Halard-Decugis.
	   The 22-year-old American officially took over as the world's top
player from Martina Hingis on Monday morning, bringing to an end
Hingis's 80 week stay at the top of the rankings, which dated back
to March 1997.

Tyson deemed 'fit' to fight again
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more detail from report; ADDS background on split
with Don King &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Mike Tyson was extremely depressed at the time
he bit Evander Holyfield's ears and is unlikely to commit such an
act again, a medical panel says in a report that finds he is
``fit'' to return to the ring.
	   Tyson said he was feeling betrayed by ``people I would have died
for'' leading up to the June 1997 title fight against Holyfield,
according to the psychiatric report released today by the state
attorney general's office.
	   The report, by a team of doctors who examined the former
heavyweight champion last month, portrays him as lacking in
self-esteem and depressed to the point that he took antidepressant
drugs in the months following the Holyfield fight.
	   The report was ordered by the Nevada Athletic Commission as a
requirement for Tyson in his attempt to regain his license, which
he lost for biting Holyfield. The commission meets Monday to
consider the request.
	   The report says Tyson has a ``constellation of neurobehavioral
deficits'' that include problems with attention span, memory,
reading, spelling and impulse control.''
	   One doctor speculated that Tyson, who said he never lost
consciousness in the ring but did several times after beatings as a
child, may have residual attention-deficit disorder.
	   Tyson told the doctors he was not suicidal but has had feelings
of sadness, hopelessness and helplessness ``all my life.''
	   He was alternately engaging and hostile during the five days of
exams. Two of the doctors treating him said he snapped in anger at
them in separate instances, expressing a ``wish'' to harm one of
them at one point.
	   ``It was this evaluator's clinical impression that this incident
did not reflect Mr. Tyson's intent to intimidate but rather that it
was an expression of a fantasy in reaction to the frustration of
this evaluation,'' Dr. Jeremy D. Schmahmann wrote.
	   The report did not say whom Tyson was angry at before the
Holyfield fight, but he later had a bitter split with promoter Don
King and his managers, John Horne and Rory Holloway, claiming they
stole millions of dollars from him.
	   The team of six doctors, which examined Tyson at Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston, found that he was fit to fight again
and not likely to bite another opponent.
	   The report says Tyson felt embarrassed and humiliated by having
to undergo five days of testing and was concerned that people would
think he was ``psycho.''
	   ``I have no self-esteem, but the biggest ego in the world,''
Tyson said.
	   The report recommends that Tyson undergo psychotherapy and that
his problems with depression and self-esteem can be treated without
any further medication. The report said he had been taking the
antidepressants after the Holyfield fight and for the last month,
but stopped because it made him lose his urge to fight.
	   It concludes by saying there is no way to predict future
behavior, but the doctors believe Tyson is fit to box again.
	   ``It is the opinion of the evaluation team that Mr. Tyson is
mentally fit to return to boxing, to comply with the rules and
regulations, and to do so without repetition of June 28, 1997,''
the report said.
	   ``While we take note of the impulsivity, emotional problems and
cognitive problems outlined above, it is our opinion that none of
these, alone or in combination, render Mr. Tyson mentally unfit in
this regard.''
	   The doctors included a neuropsychologist, psychiatrist, clinical
psychologist, two neurologists and a doctor-lawyer.
	   The commission will meet Monday to determine whether to
relicense Tyson. If Tyson is denied a license, he will have to wait
another year to be able to return to the ring.
	   Tyson and his wife, Monica, had fought to keep the report
private, arguing that only members of the commission needed to know
the state of the inner workings of the former champion's mind.
	   But after a state Supreme Court ruling Monday that favored the
release of the reports, he signed a waiver agreeing to make them
public.
	   The report offers some tidbits about Tyson's life, including the
fact that he told doctors he drank alcohol four days before the
tests. Tyson had problems with drinking in his younger days, but
converted to Islam in prison and had said he did not drink any
longer.
	   At issue at Monday's hearing will not only be Tyson's
psychological records, but questions about a fight after a
fender-bender he was involved in on Aug. 31.
	   ``It will be a very interesting hearing,'' predicted Marc
Ratner, the commission's executive director.
	   The major question asked by the commission was whether the
doctors believe Tyson is mentally fit to compete without having
another episode like the one in which he bit Holyfield's ears.
	   Tyson and his advisers want the hearing as soon as possible
because they want Tyson to fight on Dec. 5 if he gets his license
back.
	   Tyson faces trial in Montgomery County, Maryland, the same day
the commission meets on assault charges filed by two men stemming
from the traffic accident outside Washington.

Two Dali statuettes stolen at exhibition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Two American-owned bronze statuettes by
surrealist Salvador Dali were stolen Tuesday at an exhibition in
the city of Norrkoeping, news reports said.
	   The two figurines_ ``Newton Without Arms'' and ``Model
Javanais'' _ were on loan from a private collection in St.
Petersburg, Fla.
	   The name of the owner was not revealed.
	   The stolen art pieces were each worth at least 200,000 kronor
(dlrs 26,000), police said.
	   However, the statues _ between 15 and 20 centimeters tall (6 and
8 inches respectively) _ are so well-known that it was unlikely
that they could be sold on the open market. The theft was likely
commissioned by a private collector, curator Lilli Pettersson was
quoted as saying by local radio in Norrkoeping, 140 kilometers (90
miles) southwest of Stockholm.
	   The alarm system was not in operation during visiting hours.
	   Dali was born in Spain 1904 and died 1989.

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
met Tuesday with King Fahd during the last leg of a Gulf tour aimed
at convincing allies to finance a regional missile defense system.
	   During the meeting, the Saudi monarch briefed Cohen on efforts
by the kingdom to try to resolve the dispute between Turkey and
Syria over Kurdish guerrillas, diplomats said.
	   The two also discussed the tension between Iran and Afghanistan.
Iran moved thousands of troops to its border with Afghanistan after
Afghanistan's Taliban admitted that ``renegade'' members of the
militia had murdered eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist.
	   Cohen also met with the defense minister, Prince Sultan.
	   Earlier, he toured the Prince Sultan Air Base south of Riyadh to
visit some 5,000 U.S. troops stationed there.
	   In his address to the troops, Cohen spoke of the American
missile strikes Aug. 20 that were in retaliation for the bombings
of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The missiles hit a factory
in Sudan and several camps believed run by Saudi dissident Osama
bin Laden in Afghanistan.
	   ``We couldn't get them or fully hurt them the way we hoped, but
by this we have sent them a strong message,'' Cohen said of the
missile strikes.
	   He said the message to bin Laden _ suspected by the United
States of being behind the embassy bombings _ was that ``if he
carries out terrorist attacks on the United States, he will not
find a safe place or refuge. ... We will be after you whenever
there is a chance to do so.''
	   The troops in Saudi Arabia are among some 24,050 U.S. military
men and women in the Gulf region, according to Pentagon figures.
The United States also has 24 Navy ships and some 170 warplanes and
helicopters in the Gulf.

Forest fires intensify, closing major highway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Forest fires raged for a fourth straight day in
northern and central Israel on Tuesday, temporarily closing a major
highway and forcing thousands of residents to leave their homes.
	   Fires in the Carmel forests blazed out of control near the
northern port city of Haifa and residents of three nearby villages
evacuated the area, some for the second time in two days. Hundreds
of prisoners were evacuated from two large jails in the north.
	   In the Western Galilee, fire destroyed 25 acres (100 dunams) of
forest, Israel radio said.
	   Israeli fire fighters worked non-stop with little success to
quell the blazes. Three fire fighter planes from Greece were to
arrive Wednesday to help, Israel TV said.
	   In the hills near Jerusalem, fires smoldering since Monday
intensified, sending thick clouds of smoke toward the Jerusalem-Tel
Aviv highway on Tuesday and briefly forcing the closure of the
major thoroughfare.

Scalfaro offers Prodi new try at governing Italy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: LEADS throughout to ADD background on collapse, key figures.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro offered toppled
Premier Romano Prodi a chance to get his job back Tuesday, giving
Italy's second-longest-serving government since World War II a
chance to keep going.
	   Prodi's center-left government collapsed five days earlier when
he lost a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies by a single
ballot. With Scalfaro's nod, Prodi now can stay on as premier _ if
he can prove he can command a majority in Parliament.
	   The fall of Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old government had come almost by
a fluke, brought on by the surprise defection of a lawmaker in
Prodi's own coalition.
	   It left Italy's leadership in turmoil at a time when NATO was
seeking its help in Kosovo and when Italy and its neighbors were
gearing up their economies for the 1999 debut of the European
common currency. The Cabinet approved NATO's use of Italy's bases,
but the participation of Italy's military was put on hold.
	   Prodi had insisted he would return only if he could keep
carrying out the cost-cutting policies that cost him the support of
hard-line Communists, leading to the failed vote of confidence.
	   That condition still stood, he said after accepting Scalfaro's
offer.
	   ``I never changed my mind,'' he told reporters. ``What is needed
is an examination of policy and an examination of the situation in
Parliament.''
	   The political crisis was brought on when the Communist
Refoundation party withdrew its support over the proposed 1999
budget, saying it didn't do enough to create jobs.
	   Scalfaro has been meeting with political leaders ever since then
to try to pick someone to form a new government.
	   Two key leaders _ Francesco Cossiga, a centrist leader, and
Armando Cossutta, leader of a breakaway faction of the Communist
Refoundation _ indicated earlier Tuesday they were falling in line
behind a new mandate for Prodi. Cossiga attached conditions,
including a say in Cabinet selections. There was no word on whether
he got his way.
	   Coalition leaders in Prodi's old government were unanimous in
wanting Prodi to lead the new one, said Scalfaro, who resisted
opposition demands to call early elections to let voters choose a
new leadership.
	   Saying full terms the ``true guarantee of democracy,'' Scalfaro
said, ``I will do everything to avoid elections.''
	   Opposition forces, led by former Premier Silvio Berlusconi,
insisted a vote had to be held 2 1/2 years early.
	   ``When a government loses its majority it must give the power of
choice back to the citizens,'' Berlusconi insisted.
	   He later expressed disgust at what was a day of political
wrangling, declaring, ``This is a farce.''
	   Prodi himself declared at a public appearance Sunday he would
tolerate no under-the-table deals to form a new majority. He
pounded his fist in the air at the very thought, roaring into the
microphone, ``No! No!''
	   There was no immediate indication when a new vote of confidence
might come. ``Seven months. Seven years,'' Prodi said, shrugging
off reporters' questions about how long he would take to prepare
his coalition.
	   Prodi has remained on as interim premier after losing Friday's
vote. He has been one of Italy's most durable premiers despite his
budget-cutting, outlasting all but the 3 1/2 years of Bettino
Craxi.

Two Dali statuettes stolen at exhibition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Two American-owned bronze statues by
surrealist Salvador Dali were stolen Tuesday at an exhibition in
the city of Norrkoeping, news reports said.
	   The two figurines_ ``Newton Without Arms'' and ``Model
Javanais'' _ were on loan from a private collection in St.
Petersburg, Florida
	   The name of the owner was not revealed.
	   The stolen art pieces were each worth at least 200,000 kronor
(dlrs 26,000), police said.
	   However, the statues _ between 15 and 20 centimeters tall (6 and
8 inches respectively) _ are so well-known that it was unlikely
that they could be sold openly.
	   The theft was likely commissioned by a private collector,
curator Lilli Pettersson was quoted as saying by local radio in
Norrkoeping, 140 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of Stockholm.
	   The alarm system was not in operation during visiting hours.
	   Dali was born in Spain 1904 and died 1989.

First talks with east Germany's ex-communists leaves optimistic
</HEADLINE>
outlook &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ Following two hours of talks Tuesday
between the leftist Social Democrats and the successor party to
former East Germany's communists, both sides said they were
optimistic over negotiations to form a state government.
	   The talks in eastern Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, are the
first that include the ex-communists - the Party of Democratic
Socialism - as possible coalition partners at a state level since
Germany unified in 1990.
	   Governor-elect Harald Ringstorff, who won the Sept. 27 election
but needs help for a majority, and PDS state chairman Helmut
Holter, both said after Tuesday's talks that a schedule had been
agreed upon that should wrap up negotiations by the end of the
month.
	   The next talks covering agriculture and environmental policies
of the new government are to take place on Friday, they said.
	   One of the toughest questions to be settled are demands by the
PDS that the state immediately cut joblessness by subsidizing 5,000
new jobs, which Ringstorff's side has said cannot be financed.
	   Both sides have left open whether the PDS would wind up sharing
power or remain in opposition and tacitly support the Social
Democrats.
	   The PDS already supports a Social Democratic minority government
in eastern Saxony-Anhalt state, but it has never officially been
part of a ruling state coalition.
	   While many western politicians in Bonn see the PDS as leftovers
of the anti-democratic East German regime, the largely
eastern-based party already cooperates at community level there,
where many people feel it better understands their interests.
	   The Social Democrats have ruled out working with the PDS at the
federal level, but party chairman Oskar Lafontaine recently said
the party would learn responsibility if included in politics at the
state level.

Official: Tehran would not oppose visit by Taliban envoy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by deputy foreign minister, EDITS to
conform, CHANGES overline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian official said Tuesday that Tehran
has detected a change in Afghanistan's Taliban militia and would
not oppose a visit by a Taliban representative, state-run Iranian
radio said.
	   The report quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Mohsen Aminzadeh as
saying that ``the Taliban's behavior has changed'' as a result of
pressure from the United Nations and the international community as
well as Iran's decision to mass troops on its border with
Afghanistan.
	   Asked about the possibility of the Taliban sending an envoy to
Tehran, Aminzadeh said Iran was ``not opposed to visits by any
envoy whose objective is to free the Iranians detained by the
Taliban,'' the radio report said. The broadcast was monitored by
the BBC in London.
	   The Taliban, which now controls about 90 percent of Afghanistan,
does not have diplomatic relations with Iran and accuse it of
supporting the anti-Taliban opposition.
	   More than 60 Iranians are still believed to be in Taliban
custody, including some 30 that Iran says were drivers delivering
humanitarian aid.
	   Aminzadeh's comments came a day after 10 Iranians released by
the Taliban returned home aboard a Red Cross plane, according to
Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency.
	   On Sunday, the Taliban returned the bodies of three slain
Iranian diplomats.
	   Both gestures were seen as trying to temper tensions between the
Taliban and Iran, which has massed more than 200,000 troops on its
eastern border with Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban acknowledged that renegade militiamen killed eight
Iranian diplomats and a journalist after the Taliban captured the
northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8.
	   Iran had demanded the Taliban return the bodies of the Iranians
and send the killers for trial in Tehran. Six bodies were returned
earlier, but the Taliban has refused to hand over the suspected
killers.
	   Taliban leaders, who are mostly Sunni Muslims, accuse Iran of
arming and financing Afghanistan's northern-based opposition, which
includes the country's minority Shiite Muslims. Most Iranians also
are Shiite Muslims.

Shootout in Tijuana leaves six dead, one injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) _ Gunmen attacked a group of people in
Tijuana in a possible drug hit early Tuesday, killing six and
injuring one.
	   The killings occurred shortly after 3 a.m. in the poor community
of El Pipila in the southern part of the border city. Police said
they found three bodies inside one car, one in a second car and two
in front of nearby houses.
	   All had been shot may times and police found 28 bullet casings
near the bodies, said Lauro Ortiz, spokeswoman for the Tijuana
judicial police.
	   Ortiz said the motive of the shootings was under investigation,
but that it might have involved drugs.
	   On Sept. 17, gunmen lined up 18 members of an alleged drug
trafficker's family south of Tijuana and opened fire, killing all
of them. That attack, like Tuesday's, occurred in the early hours
of the morning.

Efforts to save to forests win international praise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The president of Mexico and the leader of the
Russian republic of Komi were honored Tuesday for their commitment
to protect forest land.
	   Queen Elizabeth II's husband, Prince Philip, gave awards to
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and Yuri Spiridonov of northern
Russia for their efforts to restore damaged forests and protect
untouched woodland.
	   The awards were presented on behalf of World Wide Fund for
Nature in a ceremony at St. James's Palace. Prince Philip is the
fund's international president.
	   Mexico's forests were severely damaged this spring when more
than 12,600 fires raged out of control, blackening about 1 million
acres (400,000 hectares) and creating a smoky hazy that covered
much of the country.
	   Zedillo pledged in September to reforest areas ravaged by the
fires, and vowed to reduce traditional slash-and-burn agriculture,
which some blamed for igniting the woodland. He has launched a
campaign in which 85 zones comprising 470,000 acres (188,00
hectares) were declared priority areas for reforestation and
increased protection.
	   ``I accept this certificate as a tribute to those 70 Mexicans
that, fighting the fires, lost their lives. That was the human cost
that we had because of those fires,'' Zedillo said.
	   The Russian leader was honored for his pledge to protect 16
percent of the arctic republic's land, one of the largest surviving
areas of untouched woodland in Europe _ an area nearly the size of
the Netherlands.
	   The World Wide Fund for Nature has been pressing world leaders
to help protect at least 10 percent of the world's forest types by
the end of 2000. Since the campaign was launched in February 1997,
22 countries have committed to make forest conservation a priority.

Crucial Quebec election will be held this fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   METIS, Quebec (AP) _ A showdown election between Quebec
separatists and federalists will take place this fall, Premier
Lucien Bouchard announced Tuesday.
	   Bouchard, whose pro-independence government will be seeking a
second term in power, declined to specify the day of the election,
though Nov. 23 or Nov. 30 are considered likely dates.
	   Bouchard's Parti Quebecois has held power since 1994, and he had
the option of scheduling the election anytime before the fall of
1999.
	   Opinion polls suggest an extremely close election between the
Parti Quebecois and the anti-separatist Quebec Liberal Party,
headed by Jean Charest.
	   If the separatists win, they have promised to hold another
referendum on secession from Canada whenever they believe their
chances for victory are good.
	   Charest opposes holding another referendum, saying Quebeckers
are tired of the uncertainty that has lingered since separatists
narrowly lost a 1995 secession referendum.
	   The man who had led the Parti Quebecois, Jacques Parizeau,
resigned as premier following that referendum and was succeeded by
Bouchard. Though Bouchard is considered the most popular politician
in Quebec, this election will be his first in province-wide
balloting.

signed to a five-year contract and had a record of 6-16. With
rookie Ryan Leaf at quarterback, the Chargers won their first two
games, but then lost four straight as Leaf was benched during two
of the losses.
	   The Chargers scored just 22 touchdowns in 22 games under
Gilbride, an offensive coordinator in Houston and Jacksonville
before taking the San Diego job. Leaf has just one TD pass and has
turned over the ball 15 times.
	   Before becoming coach of the Chargers, Gilbride was probably
best known for a sideline fight in a nationally televised game with
defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan.
	   Jones, 45, was head coach at Atlanta from 1994-96, going 19-30.
Both Gilbride and Jones began their careers as proponents of the
run-and-shoot offense, although San Diego lately has been using a
more conventional system.
	   Defensive end William Fuller welcomed the change.
	   ``We were playing for ourselves, not to save his job,'' Fuller
told XTRA Radio in San Diego. ``Too many players were falling
asleep at meetings and nothing was being done about it.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ In a growing show of force across France, as many
as 100,000 high school students _ lacking organization but not
enthusiasm _ took to the streets Tuesday to demand smaller classes
and better equipment.
	   Though disturbances were few on the second day of the national
protest, a 15-year-old student was killed when she was hit by a
truck. Police called it an unfortunate accident.
	   The students, who began the school year in early September, warn
they will stay out of school and continue protesting unless the
government comes up with funds to relieve overcrowded classrooms
and provide better equipment, such as computers.
	   Tuesday's marches disrupted traffic in cities from Rennes, in
northwest France, to Toulouse, in the south. Some of the largest
were in Bordeaux, where 16,000 students hit the streets, carrying
banners that read: ``Mobilization. Action for Good Conditions.''
	   Some 16,000 students also marched in Toulouse. School officials
there later announced that 80 teaching posts would be added, RTL
radio reported.
	   Police kept a watchful eye, but there were only a few arrests.
Among them, four students were in custody in the northeastern city
of Nancy, and three were arrested in Marseille on the southern
coast for throwing eggs at police.
	   In the southwestern town of Niort, a 15-year-old girl was hit by
a truck and killed, local police said. The girl was not identified;
nor was another student who was badly injured.
	   Though the protesters lack any real national organization, their
numbers were estimated Tuesday at 80,000-100,000 nationwide _
significantly higher than a day earlier.
	   There were 8,000 in Rennes, 5,000 in Marseille, Grenoble and
Metz, 4,000 in Lyon and Montpellier, and smaller numbers in other
towns.
	   In the capital, though, the turnout was estimated at only 3,000
_ much smaller than the 10,000 who came out Monday, the first day
of the movement. Five students in Paris remained in custody
Tuesday.
	   Large crowds were expected in the capital Thursday, however,
responding to a call for a more organized ``national day'' of
protest.
	   Education Minister Claude Allegre, speaking in the National
Assembly, called for a better apportionment of resources, and said
he would present a plan in the Cabinet Wednesday aimed at spreading
teachers around the country in a more equitable way.
	   One of the largest teacher's unions called on Tuesday for its
members to show solidarity with their protesting students.

Esposito brothers ousted by Lightning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ The Tampa Bay Lightning fired brothers
Phil and Tony Esposito on Tuesday in a front-office shakeup by a
team with the worst record in the National Hockey League last
season.
	   Phil Esposito, the general manager, and Tony Esposito, the
director of hockey development, are both in the Hockey Hall of Fame
and have been with the Lightning since their inception in 1992-93.
	   Coach Jacques Demers will also become general manager while head
scout Don Murdoch takes over as director of hockey development. The
team will look for an assistant general manager.
	   Tampa Bay (0-1-1) finished last season with a 17-55-10 record,
by far the poorest in the league.
	   Before joining the Lightning, Phil Esposito was general manager
of the New York Rangers from 1986-88. Tony Esposito was GM of the
Pittsburgh Penguins from 1988-89 before coming to Tampa in 1991.
	   The brothers appeared in 16 NHL all-star games between them.

Little Io is big on volcanoes and natural electricity, study shows
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADISON, Wisconsin (AP) _ More than 30 volcanoes spew lava, an
eerie blue light erupts from torrid fountains and a natural dynamo
generates more electricity than every power plant in America
combined. That's Io, a moon of Jupiter that is sort of an energy
hell.
	   New photos from the Galileo satellite show lava glowing in red
pools, scattered like an angry rash across the face of Io. There is
a bluish color from some eruptions, and, in black space just above,
there is an arc of light generated by power surges estimated at
more than 400,000 volts.
	   It all comes from a combination of volcanism, magnetic field
power generation and the enormous gravitation forces of Jupiter,
the monster that is Io's mother planet, said Paul Geissler of the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
	   Tidal forces from Jupiter twist and contort little Io, creating
frictional heat that erupts in at least 32 volcanoes, he said.
	   ``Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system,''
Geissler said Tuesday at a meeting of the planetary division of the
American Astronomical Society.
	   There is enough lava flowing every year on Io, said Geissler, to
cover the entire surface almost a half inch (more than a
centimeter) deep. For this reason, the little moon is the only
major body known in the solar system to have no evidence of
asteroid craters. The lava erases the impact mark, he said.
	   Pillon, a major Io volcano, spews lava that is about 2,600
degrees F (1,400 degrees C), hundreds of degrees hotter than
volcanoes now active on Earth, said Geissler.
	   As it orbits Jupiter, Io intersects powerful magnetic field
lines from the giant planet and acts like an enormous electrical
generator. This natural dynamo creates more than a trillion watts
of power _ greater than the total output of all U.S. power
stations, he said.
	   The power causes Io to glow when it is in the shadow of Jupiter.
Pictures from Galileo show the moon with a glimmering halo.
	   Near the surface, the combination of electricity and gases from
the volcanoes create an even more unusual sight, said Geissler.
Sulfur dioxide venting from the volcanoes is energized by the
charged particles from the electrical fields. The gas then glows in
a brilliant blue.
	   Geissler said it works in the same way electricity causes
chemical vapor to glow in street lights that use mercury vapor,
which shines bluish white, or sodium vapor, which makes yellowish
light.
	   Io also has fields of red and green, generated when charged
particles energize molecules of oxygen and hydrogen and other
gases.
	   ``This light show has been going on for a billion years,'' said
Geissler, ``and this is the first time it has ever been seen.''
	   Galileo, orbiting Jupiter and its moons for 2 1/2 years, will
continue taking photos of the planet and its satellites for at
least another year.
	   Io is 2,236 miles (3,598 kilometers) in diameter, slightly
larger than the Earth's moon. Io is one of four Jupiter moons
discovered by Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei, one of the first
astronomers to study the heavens with a telescope. The other major
moons are Gannyede, Europa and Callisto. Jupiter has at least a
dozen smaller moons.

Netanyahu to visit Jordan ahead of U.S. summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 3rd graf with Netanyahu's office confirming
meeting. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
is to visit Jordan on Wednesday for talks ahead of a U.S. summit
aimed at advancing Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
	   A palace official said Tuesday that Netanyahu will hold talks
with Crown Prince Hassan, King Hussein's younger brother who is
acting as regent while the monarch undergoes cancer treatment in
the United States.
	   In Jerusalem, Netanyahu's office confirmed there would be a
two-hour breakfast meeting with the crown prince. Netanyahu was to
leave Israel on Wednesday night for the summit, his office said.
	   Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are scheduled to
meet Thursday at a retreat outside the U.S. capital.
	   President Clinton is hosting the summit, which will focus on a
further Israeli pullback from 13 percent of West Bank land.
	   Arafat was in Jordan on Monday for consultation with Hassan
ahead of the summit.
	   Jordan and Egypt, the only two Arab countries at peace with
Israel, have been attempting to mediate an Israeli-Palestinian
settlement.
	   Netanyahu's visit will be his first to Jordan in more than a
year. Relations between the two neighbors cooled when Israeli
secret service agents were exposed last year after botching an
attempt on the life of a Muslim militant leader in Jordan.
	   In Gaza City, meanwhile, Arafat's office said Tuesday that the
Palestinian leader would make a special stop in Rochester,
Minnesota, on his way to the summit to visit King Hussein. The king
is being treated at Mayo Clinic.
	   Arafat also was to meet Wednesday afternoon with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, his office said.

Milosevic gives in to NATO, but could emerge stronger at home
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; By DUSAN STOJANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Just as in Bosnia, Slobodan
Milosevic has agreed under NATO pressure to stop a military
crackdown against non-Serbs. But what the West considers his defeat
may again prove to be the Yugoslav leader's triumph at home.
	   Nationalist support for Milosevic could grow as a result of his
staving off an attack by what Serbs see as a world arrayed against
them. Such support would strengthen, for instance, Milosevic's hand
against pro-Western Montenegro, the small republic that, along with
Serbia, makes up Yugoslavia, and recently has been threatening his
authority.
	   In Kosovo, the threat of NATO bombs led Milosevic to agree to an
unarmed force of 2,000 observers to monitor his pledge to withdraw
his forces and re-establish peace. Agreeing to such an inspection
force looks from abroad like a huge blow to Milosevic's prestige,
diminishing his hitherto undisputed control over all Yugoslavia.
	   But only hours after agreeing to the deal with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke, Milosevic was already putting the gloss of
triumph on his defeat.
	   ``The agreement ... will solve the problem in a peaceful way ...
in accordance with the interests of our country,'' he said on state
television. Convincing Serbs could be easy _ state TV reports only
what it's told.
	   Opposition leaders within Yugoslavia were unimpressed.
	   ``Milosevic is like a bad gambler,'' Vesna Pesic of the Civic
Alliance said. ``He always raises the ante, knowing he has no money
to pay and asks his citizens to do it for him.''
	   ``For every normal citizen, this time the bill should be too
high.''
	   But Milosevic's authority is not endangered _ yet. For years, he
has been able to count on rural, nationalistic Serbs who admire him
for his toughness and strong-arm tactics and who distrust the
United States.
	   His ``saving'' of Kosovo _ by averting the NATO threat the West
accuses him of creating _ is also likely to give him some
popularity among the better-educated, urban Serbs who view Kosovo
as the cradle of Serbian culture and the NATO response as overkill.
	   ``After a long delay, Milosevic has accepted what he had to
accept anyway,'' said Svetozar Marovic, the parliament speaker in
the republic of Montenegro and a Milosevic critic. ``Now his media
will start glorifying him as if he has saved Kosovo and Serbia _
his defeat will be portrayed as his victory.''
	   The Kosovo agreement itself gives Milosevic enough room to stall
if he chooses to.
	   It provides for the withdrawal of the Serb special police units
that have spearheaded attacks on ethnic Albanian villages and sent
some 270,000 refugees fleeing their homes. But for now, it
apparently leaves in place the local Serb police, instruments of a
decade of abuses against Albanians that they say precipitated the
current crisis.
	   Now, he could conceivably drag his feet, giving only as much as
he absolutely needs to, hoping international interest in Kosovo
will weaken.
	   And by concentrating only on Kosovo, the agreement leaves him
free to deal with Montenegro and domestic critics as he wishes.
After all, by leaving out Kosovo and concentrating on Bosnia alone,
the U.S.-brokered Dayton agreement left him a free hand in Kosovo.
	   Resolution of the Kosovo crisis would clear the way for a
showdown with the pro-Western leadership of Montenegro, which has
openly challenged Milosevic's crackdown in Kosovo and his drive to
consolidate his power.
	   About half of Montenegro's population is believed loyal to
Milosevic, giving him enough leverage to foment unrest, or even
eventual uprising.
	   In Serbia, Milosevic's foes are opposition parties and the
independent media that defied him to report on the NATO threat.
During the crisis, he clamped down on them through an emergency law
that curtailed their broadcasting for allegedly spreading
``defeatism and panic'' among ordinary citizens.
	   Police closed down influential radio Index for allegedly lacking
a broadcast permit. Similar measures were announced against other
independent media.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report that boat lacked navigation papers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GERONA, Spain (AP) _ A pleasure boat which sank last week
killing 20 French tourists did not have its navigation papers in
order, news reports said Tuesday.
	   The excursion boat, with 139 retired French tourists aboard, was
operating without the required navigation certificate that is
issued by the government's Marine Department once a craft has
carried out series of tests, the national news agency Efe said.
	   Citing regional police, Efe said the boat, which went down at
Lake Banyoles in northeastern Spain last Thursday, had begun the
process to obtain all the proper documents earlier this year but
had not seen it through.
	   With the boat only designed to carry 80 passengers, initial
investigations indicate overcrowding and modifications to the
vessel's ventilation ducts caused the accident .
	   Earlier Tuesday, 20 hearses left this northeastern city, located
close to Banyoles, carrying the bodies of the tourists killed.
	   Once past the French border, 80 kilometers (50 miles) to the
north, most continued northwest towards the area of Nantes city
were the majority of the victims lived, the Spanish undertakers
organizing the repatriation said.
	   The two owners of the boat, one of whom was at the helm at the
time of the accident, were charged with manslaughter on Saturday.
They were allowed stay out of jail after posting bail of five
million pesetas (dlrs 34,000) Tuesday.

Ex-spy chief says East Germany planted mole at Vatican
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The former East German spy chief said Tuesday his
agency had planted a mole _ a Benedictine monk _ in the Vatican.
	   But ex-Stasi chief Markus Wolf and former Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev both denied that Soviet-bloc countries had any
involvement in the 1981 shooting of Pope John Paul II.
	   They spoke on a television special broadcast by Italy's
state-run RAI-TV to mark Friday's 20th anniversary of John Paul's
papacy.
	   Wolf said the mole supplied information on Vatican foreign
policy and was particularly interested in the work of the late
Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Agostino Casaroli.
	   He said the monk, a German, worked in the Vatican's science
offices.
	   John Paul was wounded by a Turkish gunman, Mehmet Ali Agca, who
initially told investigators he was backed by the Bulgarian secret
service and the KGB. The agencies were presumably worried that the
Polish pope would stir a revolt against communism across eastern
Europe.
	   But Italian courts found there was was insufficient evidence to
support the accusations. Agca, serving a life term in an Italian
prison, later changed his story, saying he acted alone.
	   Gorbachev, speaking through an Italian translator, said that as
far as he knew ``no government or secret service'' played a role in
the assassination attempt.
	   Another guest, the Italian prosecutor who investigated the
shooting, said he is still convinced there was a major plot. The
prosecutor, Rosario Priore, also repeated recent statements
regretting that the Vatican showed little interest in helping his
probe.

Ghana holds the Netherlands to 0-0 draw

<TEXT>
	   ARNHEM, Netherlands (AP) _ A young and inexperienced Ghana side
held the star-studded Netherlands _ which ended fourth in this
summer's soccer World Cup _ to a shock 0-0 draw Tuesday in a
friendly international.
	   The Dutch had most of the play and the majority of the chances
but could not convert on an evening when both Dennis Bergkamp of
Arsenal and Barcelona's Patrick Kluivert looked out of sorts.
	   ``Everything went wrong tonight,'' Dutch captain Frank de Boer
said.
	   Goalkeeper Richard Kingston was Ghana's hero, palming away a
delicate chip by Bergkamp in the 88th minute after the Arsenal
striker had been set free in a quick move involving Clarence
Seedorf and Kluivert.
	   Bergkamp squandered another golden chance in the 72nd minute.
The ball ricocheted to him off Kluivert leaving him free in front
of goal, but Bergkamp fired directly at Kingston.
	   The only other clear chance of the second half fell to Ghana's
Peter Oforiquaye who pounced on a bad back pass by Edgar Davids but
slipped as he shot and sent the ball wide.
	   The match, at Arnhem's Gelredome stadium, was the second for the
Dutch under new trainer Frank Rijkaard. The Dutch are co-hosting
the Euro 2000 championships with Belgium and qualify automatically
for the finals.
	   The Dutch started strongly and forced a string of corners in the
first 15 minutes but could not turn the pressure into goals.
	   Arsenal winger Marc Overmars had three good chances before the
break.
	   He first came close in the 6th minute when he cut inside from
the left flank and unleashed a powerful right-foot shot from 25
yards (meters) that Kingston palmed over the bar.
	   From the resulting corner the ball again fell to Overmars and he
again shot, but this time the attempt slid just wide of Kingston's
right post.
	   The Dutch had to wait until the 42nd minute for the next chance.
Overmars, in a carbon copy of his first effort, cut inside and shot
hard from the edge of the penalty area but keeper Kingston again
was equal to it.

After second-place disaster, Brazil stops at RFK on road to 2002
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOSEPH WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Brazil's exhibition game at RFK Stadium on
Wednesday carries about one thousandth of the magnitude of its
World Cup final match in Paris three months ago.
	   That doesn't matter, says new coach Wanderley Luxemburgo.
	   ``Being the Brazilians, we always have to win,'' Luxemburgo
said. ``That's the obligation, whether it is in Washington or
another country.''
	   Brazil lost the Cup final in a stunning 3-0 upset to France, a
second-place finish that would be hailed as a major success in any
other country, but was a national sporting disaster to a nation
that takes its soccer seriously and has four World Cup titles to
prove it.
	   ``That second place would be a super result for many people,''
said Cafu, the team's new captain. ``No one expected France to win.
They did win. In my feeling, we have to win no matter who we
play.''
	   Cafu, Denilson and Rivaldo are the only three players from the
World Cup squad who will play in Wednesday's game against Ecuador.
Organizers would like to have had Cup star Ronaldo in the lineup,
but the 22-year-old striker has been bothered by knee injuries and
has played just twice for his Italian club, Internazionale of
Milan. Luxemburgo said he hasn't spoken to Ronaldo directly and was
becoming concerned about the player's health.
	   Otherwise, Luxemburgo is trying to put France '98 firmly in the
past by looking at promising talents such as Felipe and Marcelinho
Carioca with an eye on the 2002 tournament in Japan and South
Korea. His first game in charge was a 1-1 draw with Yugoslavia in
Brazil last month.
	   ``It's a game for us to analyze our players,'' said Luxemburgo,
who took over after Mario Zagallo and his entire staff were fired
following the World Cup. Some veterans he left home, he said,
``don't have to be tested because they have been tested
previously.''
	   It makes for an unusual role for someone like 21-year-old
Denilson, who looks at all the youngsters and suddenly feels like a
seasoned veteran.
	   ``We try to give them a lot of attention, because when I came
here for the first time, I was well received,'' said the striker,
who has five goals in 21 international appearances. ``I play with
personality and with joy, and I know that my teammates believe in
my work.''

Spanish club Espanyol frees up Argentine national coach Bielsa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARCELONA, Spain (AP) _ Marcelo Bielsa is expected to take over
as coach of Argentina shortly following his removal by Spanish
first division side Espanyol, according to news reports Tuesday.
	   After a board meeting, Espanyol agreed to replace Bielsa with
fellow countryman Miguel Angel Brindisi, the national news agency
Efe said.
	   Bielsa, who took over Espanyol earlier this year, has wanted to
leave the Spanish club ever since he was appointed Argentine
national coach in August, replacing Daniel Passarella who was
ousted following the side's disappointing World Cup performance in
France.
	   Brindisi, who is expected to arrive in Spain this weekend, has
previously coached Guatemala's national side.

Van Roost beats error-plagued Kournikova

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Anna Kournikova double-faulted 17
times, handing eighth-seed Dominique Van Roost a 6-3, 6-1 victory
in the first round of the European Championships on Tuesday.
	   Van Roost a day earlier became the first Belgian man or women
ever to break into the world's top-10 rankings.
	   ``It makes a huge difference when you know you've entered the
top-10 and you've beaten some really great players,'' said Van
Roost, who ended Martina Hingis's reign as world No. 1 when she
toppled the Swiss player in the quarterfinals in Filderstadt last
week.
	   ``It made a huge difference on my side and on the other side
because she knew it, too.''
	   Kournikova, who dropped out of the top-10 after tearing
ligaments in her right thumb in a fall in Eastbourne, is currently
ranked 12th. She has not lost to anyone ranked outside the world's
top-15 since the start of 1997.
	   ``I was a bit nervous but I'm not feeling pressure from
anybody,'' said Kournikova, who repeatedly looked over to her coach
Pavel Slozil after losing a point. ``I was just getting uptight as
the match went on.''
	   With Hingis withdrawing due to an ankle injury, it was
fifth-seed Patty Schnyder who kept the Swiss crowd happy with a
6-2, 6-3 victory over Italy's Silvia Farina.
	   American qualifier Corina Morariu posted a 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 win
over France's Sandrine Testud.
	   Sixth-seed Amanda Coetzer advanced to the second round with a
7-5, 6-4 win over Natascha Zvereva of Belarus.
	   American Lisa Raymond, who reached the semifinals last year
after upsetting Hingis in the quarterfinals, advanced to the second
round with a 6-4, 6-4 victory over lucky-loser Catalina Cristea of
Romania.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro offered toppled
Premier Romano Prodi a chance to get his job back Tuesday, giving
Italy's second-longest-serving government since World War II an
opportunity to keep going.
	   Prodi's center-left government collapsed five days earlier when
he lost a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies by a single
ballot. With Scalfaro's nod, Prodi can now stay on as premier _ if
he can prove he can command a majority in Parliament.
	   The fall of Prodi's 2 1/2-year-old government had come almost as
a fluke, brought on by the surprise defection of a lawmaker in
Prodi's own coalition. It left Italy's leadership in turmoil at a
time when NATO was seeking its help with Kosovo and when Italy and
its neighbors were gearing up their economies for the 1999 debut of
the European common currency.
	   Prodi had insisted he would return only if he could keep
carrying out the cost-cutting policies that cost him the support of
hard-line Communists, leading to the failed vote of confidence.
	   That condition still stood, he said after accepting Scalfaro's
offer.
	   ``I never changed my mind,'' he told reporters. ``What is needed
is an examination of policy and an examination of the situation in
Parliament.''
	   The political crisis was brought on when the Communist
Refoundation party withdrew its support over the proposed 1999
budget, saying it didn't do enough to create jobs. Scalfaro has
been meeting with political leaders ever since then to try to pick
the next premier.
	   Two key leaders _ Francesco Cossiga, a centrist leader, and
Armando Cossutta, leader of a breakaway faction of the Communist
Refoundation _ indicated earlier Tuesday they were falling in line
behind a new mandate for Prodi. Cossiga attached conditions,
including a say in Cabinet selections. There was no word on whether
he got his way.
	   Coalition leaders in Prodi's old government were unanimous in
wanting Prodi to lead the new one, said Scalfaro, who resisted
opposition demands to call early elections to let voters choose a
new leadership.
	   Saying full terms were the ``true guarantee of democracy,''
Scalfaro said, ``I will do everything to avoid elections.''
	   There were suggestions that Prodi's partners would support his
government for only three months, long enough to get a new budget
passed. Scalfaro called the budget talks all-important, saying
Italy ``must not waste the opportunity won when it qualified for
European monetary union.''
	   Opposition forces, led by former Premier Silvio Berlusconi,
insisted a vote had to be held, 2 1/2 years early.
	   ``When a government loses its majority it must give the power of
choice back to the citizens,'' Berlusconi insisted.
	   He later expressed disgust at what was a day of political
wrangling, declaring, ``This is a farce.''
	   Prodi himself declared at a public appearance Sunday he would
tolerate no under-the-table deals to form a new majority. He
pounded his fist in the air at the very thought, roaring into the
microphone, ``No! No!''
	   There was no immediate indication when a new vote of confidence
might come. Prodi shrugged off reporters questions about how long
he would haggle with potential allies. ``Seven months. Seven
years,'' he said.
	   Prodi has remained on as interim premier after losing Friday's
vote. His has been one of the most durable of Italy's 55 postwar
governments, outlasting all but the 3 1/2 years of Bettino Craxi.

Vasco and U. Catolica decide berth in Mercosur Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Vasco da Gama meets Universidade
Catolica of Chile on Wednesday in a game that virtually guarantees
the winner a spot in the quarterfinals of the Mercosur Cup.
	   The teams have six points and are locked in a three-way tie with
Argentina's River Plate for second place in Group E, one point
behind leader Gremio of Brazil.
	   Even if Gremio wins its final game Thursday against River Plate,
the winner of the Vasco-U. Catolica matchup will likely qualify as
one of the three best second-place teams.
	   National champion Vasco will send its second-string squad,
nicknamed ``the Little Express,'' against the visitors. The ``A''
team will get a rest for Thursday's game against Palmeiras for the
Brazilian first-division league.
	   But the reserve squad has acquitted itself well in the
tournament of former South American champions. It tied twice with
River Plate, split with Gremio and tied U. Catolica in Santiago.
	   And Vasco promises an offensive onslaught against the visitors
on Thursday. Coach Alcir Portela announced a lineup with three
forwards: Mauricinho, Sorato and Luis Claudio.
	   The Brazilian team also is counting on a lift from its raucous
fans at Sao Januario stadium, where Vasco traditionally plays well.
	   The game starts at 9:45 p.m. local time (2345 GMT).

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Hundreds of firefighters, soldiers and
civilians battled fires Tuesday that already have destroyed 1.75
million square meters (432 acres) of pine forest and olive and
citrus groves.
	   Three civil defense workers were injured battling blazes near
the southern provincial capital of Sidon, Lebanese radio stations
reported.
	   The fire brigade and civil defense forces have canceled all
leaves to mobilize more people to fight the fires.
	   The government also dispatched soldiers to battle the blazes,
and U.N. peacekeepers deployed north of the border with Israel used
helicopters to drop water on some fires before they were grounded
by smoke and haze.
	   U.N. peacekeepers were forced to leave one of their positions
Tuesday night when flames came within a few hundred meters (yards)
of them, U.N. officials said. The position was in the coastal
village of Mansoureh, south of the port city of Tyre.
	   The command of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon also ordered
its troops to assist residents of Mansoureh who wanted to evacuate
the homes. The village has a population of about 4,000 people.
	   In hilly suburbs of Beirut, the smoke and smell of burning wood
enveloped a large area Tuesday night. Sirens of fire engines could
be heard through the evening.
	   The blazes began over the weekend in the wooded hills of Batroun
in northern Lebanon. They spread quickly to areas that were
unusually dry due to a recent heat wave.
	   Some 150 fires have been reported in areas ranging from the
outskirts of Tripoli, 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Beirut, to
villages south of the port city of Tyre, 60 miles (100 kilometers)
south of the capital.

Spanish judges ask Britain for permission to quiz Pinochet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Two Spanish judges on Tuesday asked British
authorities for permission to question former Chilean dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet who is currently in hospital in London, a lawyer
representing victims of the Pinochet era said.
	   Pinochet, who is recovering from surgery in the English capital,
is implicated in two separate Spanish judicial probes into human
rights violations in Chile and Argentina.
	   The judges base their request to question Pinochet on the
European Convention on Terrorism which requires signatories to aid
each others' judicial processes related to terrorism, said Juan
Garces, a lawyer involved in the Chile investigation.
	   The Spanish judges are investigating accusations against
Pinochet of genocide and international terrorism.
	   Judge Manuel Garcia Castellon opened his probe into murder,
torture and disappearances during Pinochet's 1973-1990 regime in
July 1996.
	   According to Garces, Garcia Castellon is close to winding up the
investigation and indicting the man who ousted elected Chilean
President Salvador Allende with a bloody coup 25 years ago.
	   Meanwhile, Judge Baltasar Garzon is investigating the
disappearance of hundreds of Spanish citizens in Argentina during
the military dictatorships between 1976-83.
	   Pinochet is implicated in the Argentina probe through his
involvement in ``Operation Condor,'' a scheme to coordinate
anti-leftist campaigns by military regimes throughout Latin
America's southern cone.
	   At the weekend, Chilean officials said Pinochet was making a
positive recovery from surgery for a herniated disc in an
unidentified hospital. It was not known how long he would have to
remain in hospital.
	   Pinochet remained commander-in-chief of the Chilean army until
last March, when he was sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post
established for him by a constitution drafted by his regime.

Aerospace firms state case for huge fighter plane contract
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Competing for a jet fighter contract estimated
at dlrs 2.5 billion, representatives of two American aerospace
giants met with Israel's defense minister Tuesday, Israel TV
reported.
	   At stake is the choice for the next generation of fighter planes
for Israel's air force. In the coming months, Israel is expected to
choose between the F-15i, offered by Boeing, and the F-16, a
product of Lockheed Martin Corp.
	   Executives from the two companies met separately with Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai Tuesday, according to the Israel
TV report. The American representatives are in Israel to attend an
international business conference sponsored by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Both planes are state-of-the-art long-range fighter planes.
Their manufacturers claim that both aircraft offer all-weather and
night-flight capabilities.
	   The Israeli air force already has 25 of the Boeing F-15i
warplanes in service. Israel television reported that Israel wants
Boeing to increase the plane's range, as it considers buying more
of the aircraft. Each F-15i costs about $80 million.
	   The Israeli air force also flies earlier versions of the
Lockheed F-16 fighter-bomber. It is smaller and cheaper than the
F-15i, but carries less payload.
	   Also Tuesday, Boeing signed a co-operation agreement with the
Israeli aerospace concern, Israel Aircraft Industries. The two
companies have had a working relationship for many years.

Netanyahu seeks Cabinet backing for agreement with Palestinians

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of a make-or-break Mideast summit in
Washington, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday no deal
would be signed on an Israeli troop pullback hours after an unknown
assailant fatally shot an Israeli.
	   The violence underscored the key issue of the upcoming summit _
Netanyahu's demand that the Palestinians do more to prevent terror
attacks against Israelis.
	   ``In light of this gloomy reality, there is absolutely no
chance, at this stage, of signing an agreement,'' said a statement
released by Netanyahu's office.
	   The United States wants Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to conclude an agreement on a long-overdue Israeli troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   In exchange, Israel wants security guarantees from the
Palestinians. Israel TV, quoting an unnamed source close to the
talks, said CIA director George Tenet had completed a deal on
security favored by both sides. Tenet was in the region last week
and met Arafat and Israeli officials.
	   But Netanyahu has come under increasing pressure from right-wing
members of his government and newly appointed Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon, who oppose ceding land to the Palestinians.
	   On Tuesday, Netanyahu's Cabinet formulated a list of nine
demands which the Palestinians must meet before a withdrawal can
take place and hardliners in his coalition issued a new ultimatum,
saying the premier will have to choose between staying in power and
agreeing to a West Bank withdrawal.
	   Netanyahu has said he would bring back any deal for government
and possibly parliamentary approval before a signing. But Michael
Kleiner, who represents a powerful 17-member right-wing block in
Netanyahu's coalition, said any indication that Netanyahu would
agree to a pullout, could topple his government.
	   ``To us, initialing is agreement, and that would be enough for
us to bring down the government,'' Kleiner told The Associated
Press. It was the clearest warning yet that Kleiner's colleagues
were serious about walking away from the government.
	   Netanyahu has agreed in principle to hand over 13 percent of the
West Bank, with some restrictions. The key issue to be tackled in
Washington is to work out an agreement on what constitutes a good
faith Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat many differences remained.
``There's a lot to be solved, if not here, then there (in
Washington),'' Arafat told reporters.
	   Both Arafat and Netanyahu were to consult with other world
leaders Wednesday including Britain's Tony Blair, Jordan's King
Hussein and his brother the crown prince who is acting as regent.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said the government ``is
seeking to reach an agreement with the Palestinian Authority on the
condition that it will fulfill its commitments and Israel's
security needs will be answered,'' he told reporters after the
Cabinet met.
	   The nine conditions laid out by the Cabinet for any deal include
Palestinian cooperation on security, an end to public incitement,
disarming militants and decreasing the size of the Palestinian
police force.
	   The Cabinet also said the Palestinians must remove clauses from
its charter calling for Israel's destruction, arrest and extradite
suspects in terror attacks, and fight terror.
	   The National Religious Party said it would also bring down the
government if Netanyahu reaches a deal without securing the
demands. The party, the patron of the Jewish settlement movement in
the West Bank and Gaza, has enough seats in the 120-member
parliament to rob Netanyahu of his parliamentary majority.
	   Netanyahu said he would stick to security demands during the
Washington talks.
	   ``I think this attack, this tragic attack, strengthens our
position that what we expect to see in Washington ... is strict
fulfillment of the Palestinian commitments. Everything depends on
this,'' Netanyahu told reporters later.
	   He condemned Tuesday's fatal shooting by an unknown assailant
who fired from a pistol at two Israeli men bathing in a spring near
the communal farm of Ora west of Jerusalem. Itamar Doron, a 24
year-old student from Ora was killed and his friend, who was not
immediately identified remained in critical condition in
Jerusalem's Hadassah hospital with gunshot wounds to the chest and
stomach. The assailants' car was later found abandoned near the
West Bank.
	   ``We are being asked to turn over additional territory, and it's
impossible to expect us to do that when the territories now under
Palestinian Authority control are used as bases for planning and
staging terror attacks against us. So our demands for security
arrangements are the minimum requirement for reaching agreement,''
Netanyahu said.
	   Netanyahu said that if the assailant fled to Palestinian
territory, as has been the case in the past, that Arafat's
Palestinian Authority must work immediately to apprehend them.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council sought to give Iraq a
positive message Tuesday, saying only a few outstanding questions
needed to be answered regarding the dismantling of Baghdad's
weapons programs.
	   The council noted a report by the U.N. nuclear agency that said
if Iraq resumed cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors, there would
be no impediment to switching from intrusive spot inspections of
suspected nuclear sites to an ongoing monitoring and verification
program.
	   Permanent council members Russia, France and China have pushed
for the switch to give Iraq an indication that after seven years of
inspections, there was some progress toward ending crippling
economic sanctions.
	   Russia's U.N. ambassador, Sergey Lavrov, said ``there could be
real progress'' if Iraq allowed inspectors to get back to work.
	   But the United States and Britain both said clarifications were
needed on the nuclear front before any switch away from spot
inspections.
	   ``Our position has not changed on the nuclear file,'' the deputy
U.S. ambassador, Peter Burleigh, said. ``There is no new
information that's been provided by the government of Iraq in the
six-month period.''
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _ and the missiles to
deliver them _ before the 15-member council will lift sanctions
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Iraq suspended cooperation with U.N. inspectors Aug. 5, ending
spot searches of suspected weapons sites, after the chief U.N. arms
inspector refused to certify that it had given up its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his top advisers decided
Tuesday to delay a decision on resuming cooperation, the official
Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   The council was briefed by the chief inspector, Richard Butler,
and Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, which conducts nuclear inspections, on the progress
of searches over the last six months.
	   Their reports, released last week, shed little new light on what
is known about Iraq's abilities to make weapons of mass
destruction.
	   The council noted Butler's claim that Iraq had nearly completed
disarming itself of chemical weapons and missiles, but that
questions remain about its biological weapons capabilities.
	   Butler told the council Tuesday that he had received the final
results from French laboratories charged with testing warheads for
the deadly VX nerve agent, diplomatic sources said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. Chemical weapons experts are expected to
meet here next week to determine the findings.
	   An earlier test by a U.S. lab found traces of the compound on
missile fragments.
	   In his report, Butler said sampling of warheads by the
commission has ``thrown significant doubt'' on Iraq's claim that it
never was able to put the deadly gas into weapons.
	   In its report, the IAEA repeated its previous claims that over
the past six months, it found no new evidence that Iraq had tried
to restart its nuclear weapons program. The gaps that exist can be
filled in over the course of the long-term monitoring program, it
said.
	   ElBaradei noted that inspectors will never be able to verify
that Iraq has destroyed its banned weapons and can no longer
restart its weapons programs.
	   ``We have credible assurances,'' ElBaradei told reporters. ``We
cannot certify, in the case of Iraq or any country. That is beyond
the limit of any verification process.''

<TEXT>
	   GERONA, Spain (AP) _ A pleasure boat which sank last week
killing 20 French tourists did not have its navigation papers in
order, news reports said Tuesday.
	   The excursion boat, carrying 139 French tourists, was operating
without a navigation certificate issued by the government's Marine
Department once a craft has been tested, the national news agency
Efe said.
	   Citing regional police, Efe said the boat, which sank in Lake
Banyoles in northeastern Spain last Thursday, had started to obtain
the documents earlier this year but had not completed the process.
	   With the boat only designed to carry 80 passengers, initial
investigations indicate that overcrowding and modifications to the
vessel's ventilation ducts caused the accident.
	   The two owners of the boat, one of whom was at the helm at the
time of the accident, were charged with manslaughter on Saturday.
They were allowed stay out of jail after posting bail of five
million pesetas (dlrs 34,000) on Tuesday.

Panama Canal revenues rise despite drought
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) - Despite a drought that forced a
lowering of water levels, toll revenues at the Panama Canal
increased about 10 percent in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
	   The higher revenues were partly the result of a 7.5 percent toll
increase that took effect in January, said a report released
Tuesday by the Canal Commission, the U.S. agency that administers
the canal.
	   The canal earned dlrs 545.7 million in the 1998 fiscal year,
compared with 493.6 million the previous fiscal year, the report
said.
	   It said the Asian economic crisis and this year's drought did
not hurt shipments. The drought, blamed on the El Nino weather
phenomenon prompted the commission to lower the canal level in
March, forcing ships to carry lighter loads.
	   This year 192 million tons of merchandise passed through the
canal, compared with 190 tons in the 1997 fiscal year.
	   The number of ships passing through the canal dropped slightly
to 13,135 from 13,158.
	   The canal, built in 1914, will be returned to Panama Dec. 31,
1999.

Brazil stocks close higher bolstered by international markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Calm international markets and growing
optimism that the government would soon announce financial
austerity measures pushed markets higher Tuesday.
	   Sao Paulo's Bovespa stock exchange closed up 1.25 percent and
the smaller Rio de Janeiro exchange closed up 2.59 percent.
	   ``It was a combination of good news and generally calm foreign
markets that helped us,'' said one Sao Paulo fund manager. ``We
were also still absorbing the strong gains shown around the world
when we weren't open,'' he added, referring to Monday's market
holiday in Brazil.
	   Traders cited news that the U.S. Congress and the White House
had reached an agreement to give the International Monetary Fund
dlrs 18 billion as a key market booster.
	   They also pointed to a clear willingness on the part of the
government to introduce austerity measures, seen as a necessary
pre-condition of any international aid package.

	   ROME (AP) _ There's nothing special about call-in shows on
Italian TV, but it's never happened before that the pope's on the
line.
	   During a special Tuesday night on the 20 years of his
pontificate, Pope John Paul II called up middway through the
program to thank the moderator, Bruno Vespa.
	   The pope said he was grateful for the interest and said
``grazie, grazie'' (thank you, thank you.)
	   Vespa, clearly moved, briefly lost his composure. ``Even
journalists have a soul,'' he said.
	   The show on state-run RAI-TV included interviews with figures
such as former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, former Polish
President Lech Walesa and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Riccardo Muti led an orchestra in the Sistine Chapel and Luciano
Pavarotti sang ``Ave Maria'' from his home in Modena.
	   The 20th anniversary of John Paul's election as pope is Friday.
He has scheduled a special Mass Sunday in St. Peter's Square.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The National Basketball Association took the
unprecedented step Tuesday of canceling regular season games after
collective bargaining talks between owners and players broke off
after about 3 1/2 hours.
	   The league was the only major professional sport in North
America that hadn't lost a game because of a work stoppage, but
that perfect record is now history.
	   Deputy commissioner Russ Granik said the first two weeks of
games from Nov. 3-16 will not be made up.

	   The next move in the dispute will come from the owners, who will
deliver a counterproposal later this week.
	   ``It doesn't look promising,'' commissioner David Stern said.
``The reality is that the owners had no choice.''
	   Stern and Granik made the announcement late in the afternoon at
a midtown Manhattan hotel after the sides had met for two sessions,
one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The players made a
counterproposal in the morning, addressing the owners' concern for
cost certainty by asking for a luxury tax that would be paid by
owners who sign players to exorbitant contracts.
	   Stern said the idea of a tax was something the owners would look
at, but by itself it was not enough to stop the league from
canceling games for the first time in its history.
	   And with that, the NBA's 51-year streak of 35,001 consecutive
games came to an end.
	   ``We had a somewhat more constructive dialogue, but it's hard to
say if we got closer to an agreement,'' Granik said. ``We promised
to come back with our own set of proposals.''

	   The owners imposed the lockout July 1, and the summer and early
fall passed with the sides meeting only twice for formal bargaining
sessions. The talks Tuesday were the third between the sides.
	   Patrick Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo, Ray Allen, Antonio Davis and
John Starks were among the players who attended the meeting. The
owners were represented by Gordon Gund (Cleveland), Les Alexander
(Houston), Abe Pollin (Washington) David Checketts (New York) and
Jerry Colangelo (Phoenix).
	   ``We're going to try to step up and talk about the issues
they've raised,'' union director Billy Hunter said as he arrived.
``We've got a response, but if they're inclined to wait for Dean
Feerick then nothing's going to happen.''
	   Arbitrator John Feerick, dean of Fordham Law School, is expected
rule in a week or two on a union grievance that more than 200
players with guaranteed contracts must be paid during the lockout.
	   An agreement in principle had to be reached by Tuesday to
preserve the 82-game season.
	   The season was scheduled to begin Nov. 3, but it could
conceivably have been pushed back a week or so to give teams about
four weeks to make trades, sign about 200 free agents and hold
abbreviated training camps.
	   In the last labor agreement in 1995, the owners agreed to pay
the players between 48 percent and 51.8 percent of revenues. If the
percentage went higher _ and owners claim it reached 57 percent
last season _ the owners had the right to toss out the old deal and
seek a new one, which they did.
	   They have demanded ``cost certainty'' from the players, meaning
they want to put an absolute ceiling on the amount of money that
can be devoted to payrolls.
	   The union calls such a system a ``hard'' salary cap and has
vowed not to accept one.
	   ``In terms of reaching a deal, this is the worst we've ever
had,'' Granik said earlier. ``We've never gotten to this point
without being able to make a deal.
	   ``The players have to participate in some deal that lowers the
percentage of revenues being paid to salaries. But they don't see
that as their responsibility at all.''

Two Dali statuettes stolen at exhibition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS with art works found by garbage dump

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Two American-owned bronze statuettes by
surrealist Salvador Dali, stolen Tuesday at an exhibition in the
city of Norrkoeping, were later recovered, news reports said.
	   The two rare and valuable figurines_ ``Newton Without Arms'' and
``Model Javanais'' _ were on loan from a private collection in St.
Petersburg, Fla. The name of the owner was not revealed.
	   Police, acting on an anonymous tip, found the stolen art works
Tuesday night lying behind trash cans near a cemetery in central
Norrkoping, 90 miles (140 kilometers) southwest of Stockholm, the
Swedish news agency TT reported.
	   The stolen art pieces were each worth at least 200,000 kronor
(dlrs 26,000), police said. The 6-8 inch-statuettes are so
well-known that it was highly unlikely that they could have been
sold on the open market.
	   The alarm system of the gallery with the Dali exhibition was not
in operation during visiting hours. Two suspects were reported seen
by witnesses going down a rainpipe and escaping in a white Beetle
car, TT reported.
	   Dali was born in Spain 1904 and died there in 1989.

New approach shot for Woods at IMG
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ What do Tiger Woods and Greg Norman have
in common? Both made a bundle of cash under agent Hughes Norton at
International Management Group, and both eventually decided they
don't want him around any longer.
	   Alistair Johnston, head of IMG's golf division, confirmed
Tuesday that Woods has severed his relationship with Norton _
although he said Woods would remain an IMG client ``way beyond the
next five years.''
	   ``We are in a transition mode with respect to the executive team
assigned to Tiger,'' Johnston said.
	   Norton has been an adviser and family friend since Woods was a
15-year-old prodigy. By the time Woods won his third straight U.S.
Amateur title, Norton had lined up five-year contracts with Nike
and Titleist worth more than dlrs 60 million. Since then, Norton
has put together deals _ American Express and Rolex, among them _
worth about dlrs 90 million.
	   ``The decision came down to a fundamental difference,'' Earl
Woods told Sports Illustrated. ``For Hughes, the dollar is
almighty. For Tiger, money is not that important. And Hughes
underestimated Tiger's personal growth and his grasp of his own
business.''
	   Johnston said IMG is putting together a new management team for
Woods, but that ``we're happy with the direction we're going.''
	   He also said Norton would remain at IMG, although it was not
clear in what capacity. Norton has now managed _ and lost _ two of
the biggest stars in the game. In 1993, Norman left Norton and IMG
after he had handled his career for 11 years.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; PRESIDENTS CUP UPDATE: &LR;  Their reputation in match-play team
events might not be enough to get Payne Stewart and Tom Lehman on
the Presidents Cup team.
	   Jack Nicklaus doesn't plan to waste a lot of time agonizing over
his two captain's choices. At this point, he said he is inclined to
simply take the first two players outside the automatic top 10 on
the points list.
	   With three tournaments left, U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen is
11th in points, followed by John Cook, Stewart and Lehman.
	   ``If I leave a guy out at 11 or 12, those are pretty good
players,'' Nicklaus said. ``It'll be pretty difficult to select
somebody that is 13 past the guy who is 12.''
	   Unlike the Ryder Cup, where points are awarded based on top-10
finishes, the Presidents Cup points is essentially the money list,
with the dollar doubled for 1998 tournaments. With the dlrs 4
million Tour Championship as the final tournament, the makeup of
the U.S. team will be unclear until the final putt falls at East
Lake.
	   Consider this: the winner of the Tour Championship gets 1.42
million points. Among those still in the picture is Bob Estes, who
is 28th in points.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CLUB HOPPING: The Callaway-Orlimar battle took a bizarre turn
two weeks ago on the Senior Tour.
	   A Callaway tour representative, apparently eager to make points
with the boss, stole a prototype 3-wood from Orlimar when its tour
rep stepped away to use the bathroom, then sent it to headquarters
in Carlsbad, Calif.
	   ``It was wrong. It was disgusting,'' said Orlimar president
Jesse Ortiz.
	   Callaway spokesman Larry Dorman said the tour rep, helping out
that week from the LPGA Tour, was reprimanded and Orlimar was
contacted immediately. The unopened package was forwarded to
Orlimar, along with apologies.
	   Orlimar filed a complaint with the sheriff's office in Forsyth
County, North Carolina.
	   Ortiz, who said Callaway lawyers were ``first-class'' in how
they handled it, now says he's upset that the tour rep is still on
the job.
	   ``Anything short of termination just isn't fair,'' Ortiz said.
``If any of my tour reps had stolen something out of another tour
rep's bag, they'd be gone instantly.''
	   The object of the Callaway employee's desire: A 13-degree club
with a deeper face than the Orlimar TriMetal wood.
	   ``Evidently it looks just like our Steelhead,'' Dorman said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; LAURA AND THE BOYS: &LR;  Laura Davies is getting her wish _ a
chance to mix it up with the men.
	   Davies will be in the field with Ernie Els and PGA champion
Vijay Singh next month in the Johnnie Walker Super Tour, a 72-hole
tournament played in four countries _ Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan
and China.
	   Davies, one of the longest hitters on the LPGA Tour and former
No. 1 in the world, will also compete against Jesper Parnevik,
British Open runner-up Brian Watts and four Asian players. The
event starts Nov. 10.

Finding 2,000 monitors for Kosovo could take time
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT H. REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Despite the rush to implement the Kosovo
accord, officials admitted Tuesday it could take weeks before the
full complement of 2,000 international monitors is on the ground to
make sure Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic is living up to the
agreement.
	   Milosevic's acceptance of the ``verification mission'' _ both
NATO aerial reconnaissance flights and the monitors on the ground _
was a key concession in his talks with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke
to defuse the Kosovo crisis and avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   President Clinton also underscored the importance of the
mission, saying ``we will not rely on what President Milosevic
says, but what he does for the whole world to see.''
	   He said allowing the international inspectors unfettered access,
including unrestricted surveillance by NATO aircraft, was a test
Milosevic must pass in the next four days to avoid military
strikes.
	   But the Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe, which is responsible for the ground component, lacks a
large permanent staff. It will have to turn to its 54 member
states, including the United States, Russia, Canada and European
Union countries, to provide people with the proper training and
skills for the job.
	   ``We are still in the very early planning stage,'' OSCE
spokesman Mons Nyberg said. ``Over the coming weeks, we hope to see
the mission fully activated down there.''
	   The current chairman of the OSCE, Polish Foreign Minister
Bronislaw Geremek, said he was expecting formal offers from
contributing countries next week.
	   Geremek, speaking to reporters in Stockholm, Sweden, said the
Kosovo operation will be the largest ever undertaken by the
organization. ``It's a question of the future of the OSCE,'' he
said. ``It will give proof that the OSCE has a place in the
international structures.''
	   As a stopgap measure, OSCE officials plan to use the Kosovo
Diplomatic Observer Mission, activated July 6 under an arrangement
worked out between Milosevic and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   For the past four months, members of the mission _ Americans,
Canadians, Russians and Western Europeans _ have been traveling
around Kosovo, providing their governments with first-hand reports
on the fighting between ethnic Albanian rebels and Yugoslav forces
and the suffering of the nearly 300,000 refugees driven from their
homes.
	   But the diplomatic mission numbered only about 50 people. They
were all evacuated this week to neighboring Macedonia, largely
because of fears of reprisals by angry Serbs if NATO launched air
attacks.
	   Under the agreement with Holbrooke, Milosevic promised to
guarantee the safety of the verification mission.
	   Meanwhile, representatives of the 54 OSCE member states will
meet Thursday in Vienna to give their formal approval for the
verification mission. Geremek will then fly to Belgrade to sign the
agreement with Milosevic to establish the mission.

UN sending its own verification team to Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS graf with UNHCR welcoming agreement, REORGANIZES
slightly. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United Nations is planning to send its
own mission to Kosovo to verify compliance with U.N. resolutions
demanding an end to hostilities and a negotiated settlement between
Serbs and ethnic Albanians, a spokesman said Tuesday.
	   Details of the U.N. mission were sketchy. Spokesman Fred Eckhard
said only that the U.N. chief would be sending a mission to the
region ``in the coming days.''
	   The Security Council last week asked Secretary-General Kofi
Annan for such a mission, to enable the United Nations to have a
first-hand account of the situation on the ground. Since a Serb
crackdown on ethnic Albanians began in February, the United Nations
has relied on other organizations for information on the conflict.
Only U.N. humanitarian workers are in Kosovo.
	   The U.N. mission would be in addition to the 2,000-member
verification team agreed to in marathon talks between U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that
came amid threatened NATO attacks.
	   Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw his forces from Kosovo,
begin peace negotiations with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow
a team into Kosovo to verify Serb compliance with U.N. demands.
	   Russia's U.N. ambassador, Sergey Lavrov _ whose country had
opposed NATO intervention _ said Tuesday the agreement ``proves
that Ambassador Holbrooke's determination to find a diplomatic
solution with the support of the Contact Group was stronger than
the threat of force.''
	   The deputy U.S. ambassador, Peter Burleigh, said the Security
Council would probably adopt a resolution backing the agreement _
giving it the force of international law.
	   He noted that the Contact Group of states, which has been
meeting regularly on Kosovo, had said last week that there would
``probably be a Security Council resolution with regard to the
verification agreement.''
	   No text of a resolution, however, has begun circulating, council
diplomats said.
	   ``The key is compliance with all of the aspects of the Security
Council resolution 1199,'' of Sept. 23, Burleigh said.
	   The Serb crackdown, launched Feb. 28, was aimed at crushing the
Kosovo Liberation Army, fighting for independence of the majority
Albanian province, which is part of the Yugoslav republic of
Serbia.
	   Hundreds have been killed in Kosovo and hundreds of thousands
more have been forced from their homes during the seven-month
operation in Kosovo, which is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees welcomed the report of a
breakthrough in principle. The main humanitarian agency on the
ground in Kosovo hopes the agreement ``will contribute rapidly to
reducing the level fear which is currently impeding so many
displace people from returning home,'' Eckhard said.

Krajicek, Martin advance to second round
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with later results &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Former Wimbledon champion Richard
Krajicek began his comeback after a knee injury by advancing to the
second round of the CA Trophy ATP tennis tournament Tuesday.
	   In other matches involving seeded players, Greg Rusedski ousted
seventh-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-3), while
fourth-seeded Petr Korda, the Australian Open champion, beat
Fabrice Santoro 7-6 (7-4), 6-2.
	   Thomas Muster, the veteran local favorite, defeated Jan
Siemerink 6-2, 6-4.
	   Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion and this year's
semifinalist, beat Albert Costa of Spain 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 6-4.
	   The sixth-seeded Dutchman had not played a match in five weeks
after tendinitis in his left knee forced him to retire in the
fourth round of the French Open.
	   Costa saved two match points in the ninth game of the third set.
But Krajicek served out the match in the next game to set up a
second-round clash against Cedric Pioline.
	   Todd Martin also reached the second round by coming from behind
to oust new German hope Nicolas Kiefer 4-6, 6-3, 6-4.
	   Kiefer received a warning for arguing too loudly over several
line calls to give Martin a break point in the third game of the
second set. The German saved it, but Martin still gained the
decisive break of serve to go up 3-0 and tie the score.
	   In the third, a powerful forehand by Martin clipped the net cord
and gave the American another break for a 4-3 lead. Martin was down
a break point in the next game, but fired two aces in a row,
including the game-clinching one with a second serve, to protect
his lead.
	   Martin hit a service winner to win the match after two hours and
five minutes.
	   In other matches, Tommy Haas defeated Arnaud Clement 6-4, 1-6,
6-3, and qualifier Jeff Tarango upset Jason Stoltenberg 6-2, 6-2 to
set a second-round showdown with top-ranked Pete Sampras.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Two American-owned bronze statuettes by
surrealist Salvador Dali have been found by trash cans only hours
after they went missing Tuesday from an exhibition in Norrkoeping,
news reports said.
	   The two figurines_ ``Newton Without Arms'' and ``Model
Javanais'' _ were on loan from a private collection in St.
Petersburg, Florida. The name of the owner was not revealed.
	   Police, acting on a tip, found the stolen art works Tuesday
night behind trash cans near a cemetery in central Norrkoeping, 90
miles (140 kilometers) southwest of Stockholm, the Swedish news
agency TT reported.
	   The pieces were each worth at least 200,000 kronor (dlrs
26,000), police said. The 6-8 inch (17cm) statuettes are so
well-known that it was unlikely they could have been sold openly.
	   The gallery's alarm was switched off during the visiting hours.
Two suspects were reportedly seen by witnesses going down a
rainpipe and driving off in a white Beetle car, TT reported.
	   Dali was born in Spain 1904 and died there in 1989.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Two American-owned bronze statuettes by
surrealist Salvador Dali, stolen Tuesday at an exhibition in the
city of Norrkoping, were later recovered, news reports said.
	   The two rare and valuable figurines_ ``Newton Without Arms'' and
``Model Javanais'' _ were on loan from a private collection in St.

	   Police, acting on an anonymous tip, found the stolen art works

Unprecedented comeback wakes up Atlanta's fans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL NEWBERRY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The fans of Atlanta are excited about the
playoffs _ finally.
	   With the Braves two victories away from an unprecedented
comeback in the NL championship series, fans flocked to the Turner
Field tickets windows Tuesday morning, intent on making up for the
city's disappointing turnouts in the first two games.
	   A few hours later, all but 500 of the 11,000 available tickets
for Wednesday's Game 6 were gone, virtually ensuring the first
Atlanta sellout of the NLCS. In fact, standing room tickets are
likely to be sold the day of the game.
	   ``We had a great day,'' Paul Adams, the Braves ticket manager,
said. ``The people responded. I think they got excited not only
about seeing some exciting baseball, but also by what they saw from
the fans in San Diego.''
	   Two of the games at San Diego attracted more than 60,000, in
stark contrast to the more than 8,000 empty seats for Games 1 and 2
at 50,000-seat Turner Field.
	   ``It's similar to what happened two years ago in the St. Louis
series,'' Adams said, referring to the 1996 NLCS against the
Cardinals. ``We didn't sell out the first two games, but when we
came back from a 3-1 deficit, the fans responded.''
	   The Braves rallied to win that series in seven games, but this
would be a comeback of landmark proportions.
	   No major-league team has ever won a best-of-7 series after
losing the first three games. In fact, Atlanta is the first team
even to force a sixth game.
	   After a 7-6 victory in Game 5, several hundred people greeted
the team when it arrived at Atlanta Hartsfield International
Airport about 5 a.m., and ticket buyers began huddling in morning
chill outside Turner Field before the sun came up.
	   ``I got up just for this,'' John Hightower said. ``I've got to
get tickets.''
	   Still, most of those who bought tickets Wednesday took a
wait-and-see attitude toward a possible seventh game. Adams said
there were still 7,000 tickets remaining for Thursday's game, which
will be played only if the Braves win Game 6.
	   ``I'm kind of surprised,'' he said. ``They might as well have
bought them for Game 7, but a lot of them didn't do that. I guess
they didn't know the money will be refunded if the game isn't
played.''
	   Tom Glavine, who took the loss in Game 2, is scheduled to pitch
Wednesday with the Braves in another must-win situation.
	   ``They wanted to wrap it up (in San Diego) and we wanted to
prolong things to get back to Atlanta and that is what we did,''
Glavine said. ``But they are still one win away from clinching and
we have to win both games.''
	   Unlike the Padres, who shook up their rotation by using Kevin
Brown in relief Monday night, the Braves' rotation is right on
track. Glavine will be pitching with five days' rest.
	   ``I feel great, well rested,'' he said. ``I'm looking forward to
it. For being down 0-3, I was just hoping to get another start. So
I'm happy we were able to come back and still have a chance.''
	   Comebacks are nothing new to the Braves, who have gotten a
first-hand look from both sides during their seven straight
postseason appearances in the '90s.
	   In the 1992 NLCS, the Braves trailed Pittsburgh 2-0 in the ninth
inning, but Francisco Cabrera's two-out, two-run single capped a
memorable 3-2 victory.
	   Two years ago, after the Braves rallied from that 3-1 deficit to
beat St. Louis for the NL pennant, they were on the opposite end of
an improbable comeback. Atlanta won the first two games of the
World Series at Yankee Stadium _ then lost four in a row to New
York.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Missing: 1,898 vehicles, 882 computers and
1,787 generators.
	   U.N. peacekeeping missions lost over 16,000 big-ticket items
between 1993 and 1995, at a whopping cost of dlrs 23 million, a
U.N. report said Monday.
	   Most of the goods were stolen, but accidents accounted for
another significant chunk, followed by disappearances caused by
``acts of war'' or hostilities, the report said. Negligence on the
part of U.N. staff was also to blame.
	   The report covered only U.N. peacekeeping operations from those
three years, and represented only a fraction of what the United
Nations may have lost in all of its other missions, including
refugee operations, humanitarian aid and civilian police forces.
	   The period under examination, however, represented the peak of
U.N. peacekeeping operations, when 80,000 peacekeepers were
embroiled in Somalia and Bosnia and 15 other hotspots around the
world. The U.N. peacekeeping budget during that time was more than
dlrs 3 billion a year, more than the budget for all other U.N.
functions, spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   ``I'm not saying that any dlrs 23 million loss is acceptable,
but I think you should see it in the perspective of the size of our
budget and of our operations during those years,'' he said Tuesday.

Rival parties join for the first time _ over Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MERITA DHIMGJOKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Rival Albanian political parties met
Tuesday to discuss the crisis in Kosovo. It was the first meeting
uniting the governing Socialists and their arch-rivals, the
Democratic Party, since parliamentary elections in June 1997.
	   The ruling party and the Democrats of former President Sali
Berisha, who have agreed on hardly anything since wide-spread riots
of last year caused by the collapse of pyramid schemes, agreed
Tuesday to sit around a table and discuss what they called the
``national question.''
	   The roundtable was initiated by the small Republican Party, and
all parties in parliament took part.
	   Since last month when anti-government demonstrators stormed the
parliament building and took control of state television, the
opposition has refused to cooperate with the Socialist-led
coalition government.
	   The Democrats have blamed the government for the killing of
popular opposition leader Azem Hajdari and have turned down
international community calls for dialogue.
	   Hajdari's assassination and the opposition's daily street
protests led to the resignation of Prime Minister Fatos Nano last
month.
	   Newly appointed Prime Minister Pandeli Majko has spoken in favor
of a dialogue with the oposition, but only after it returns to
parliament.
	   The Democrats boycotted parliament soon after parliamentary
elections in June 1997 because they considered them irregular and
unfair. Since then they have been demanding new elections, an idea
rejected by both the government and the international community.
	   In a declaration signed at the end of Tuesday's meeting, all
parties supported what they called ``NATO's intervention in
Kosovo,'' a reference to acceptance by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic of key conditions for the pacification of the southern
Serbian Kosovo province, including verification of a pullout of
government forces.

Panama Canal revenues rise despite drought
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) - Despite a drought that forced a
lowering of water levels, toll revenues at the Panama Canal
increased about 10 percent in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
	   The higher revenues were partly the result of a 7.5 percent toll
increase that took effect in January, said a report released
Tuesday by the Canal Commission, the U.S. agency that administers
the canal.
	   The canal earned dlrs 545.7 million in the 1998 fiscal year,
compared with 493.6 million the previous fiscal year, the report
said.
	   It said the Asian economic crisis and this year's drought did
not hurt shipments. The drought, blamed on the El Nino weather
phenomenon prompted the commission to lower the canal level in
March, forcing ships to carry lighter loads.
	   This year 192 million tons of merchandise passed through the
canal, compared with 190 tons in the 1997 fiscal year.
	   The number of ships passing through the canal dropped slightly
to 13,135 from 13,158.
	   The canal, built in 1914, will be returned to Panama Dec. 31,
1999.

Netanyahu seeks Cabinet backing for agreement with Palestinians

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of his departure for a make-or-break
Mideast summit in Washington, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Tuesday that no deal would be signed on an Israeli troop
pullback following the fatal shooting of a student.
	   The violence near a communal farm outside Jerusalem underscored
the key issue of Thursday's summit: Netanyahu's demand that the
Palestinians do more to prevent terror attacks against Israelis.
	   ``In light of this gloomy reality, there is absolutely no
chance, at this stage, of signing an agreement,'' said a statement
released by Netanyahu's office.
	   On Tuesday, an unknown assailant fired a pistol at two Israeli
men bathing in a spring near Ora, west of Jerusalem.
	   Itamar Doron, a 24-year-old student from Ora, was killed and his
friend, who was not identified, was in critical condition in
Jerusalem's Hadassah hospital with gunshot wounds to the chest and
stomach. The assailants' car was later found abandoned near the
West Bank.
	   Netanyahu said that if the assailants fled to Palestinian
territory, as has been the case in the past, Yassir Arafat's
Palestinian Authority must work immediately to apprehend them.
	   Netanyahu has agreed in principle to hand over 13 percent of the
West Bank, with some restrictions. The United States wants
Netanyahu and Arafat to conclude the agreement on the troop
withdrawal.
	   In exchange, Israel wants security guarantees from the
Palestinians.
	   Israel TV, quoting an unnamed source close to the talks, said
CIA director George Tenet had completed a deal on security favored
by both sides. Tenet was in the region last week and met with
Arafat and Israeli officials.
	   Netanyahu has come under increasing pressure from right-wing
members of his government and newly appointed Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon, who oppose ceding land to the Palestinians.
	   The key issue to be tackled in Washington is an agreement on
what constitutes a good faith Palestinian crackdown on Islamic
militants.
	   On Tuesday, Netanyahu's Cabinet formulated a list of nine
demands that the Palestinians must meet before a withdrawal can
take place.
	   They include cooperation on security, an end to public
incitement, disarming militants and decreasing the size of the
Palestinian police force. The Cabinet also said the Palestinians
must remove clauses from their charter calling for Israel's
destruction, arrest and extradite suspects in terror attacks and
fight terror.
	   Netanyahu said he would bring back any deal for approval before
signing. Michael Kleiner, who represents a powerful 17-member
right-wing block in Netanyahu's coalition, said any indication that
Netanyahu would agree to a pullout could topple his government.
	   ``To us, initialing is agreement, and that would be enough for
us to bring down the government,'' Kleiner told The Associated
Press.
	   The National Religious Party also threatened to bring down the
government if Netanyahu reaches a deal without securing the
demands. The party, which supports the Jewish settlement movement
in the West Bank and Gaza, has enough seats in the 120-member
parliament to rob Netanyahu of his parliamentary majority.
	   Netanyahu said he would stick to security demands during the
Washington talks.
	   ``I think this attack, this tragic attack, strengthens our
position that what we expect to see in Washington ... is strict
fulfillment of the Palestinian commitments,'' Netanyahu told
reporters later.
	   Arafat said many differences remained. ``There's a lot to be
solved, if not here, then'' in Washington, he told reporters.

Lomu separates from wife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ All Blacks rugby star Jonah Lomu
has announced his separation from wife Tanya after two and a half
years of marriage.
	   ``It's no one's fault, but we have drifted apart,'' Lomu said in
a statement Wednesday. ``My life with rugby is very demanding. I am
away a lot, and it has been very hard on Tanya coming to New
Zealand from South Africa and adjusting to life here.
	   ``We have tried hard to make our relationship work but there
comes a point where if you are not happy, you have to face
reality.''
	   Lomu, then 20, and Tanya Rutter, then 19, were married in a
secret ceremony on the banks of Manukau Harbor, Auckland, in March
1996. Lomu did not invite his parents.
	   He cried on television as he said not inviting his mother to his
wedding was ``the hardest thing.''
	   ``I felt that they didn't really want me to do it; I was scared
they wouldn't let me do it,'' Lomu said.
	   He intended to tell his mother after the wedding, but the media
beat him to it.
	   ``That wasn't the way I expected it to happen,'' Lomu said.
	   A few days after the wedding Lomu said he had made peace with
his mother and planned a second wedding in South Africa for
everyone from the family.

Minister: Iraq needs thousands of tractors, harvesters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq needs thousands of tractors and
harvesters to boost its farm output, Agriculture Minister
Abdel-Ilah Hamid Saleh said Tuesday.
	   He estimated the country needs ``several thousand'' tractors and
at least 2,500 harvesters over the next five years.
	   But he also acknowledged that continuing U.N. trade sanctions,
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, made it hard to pay
for the goods.
	   The sanctions limit Iraq's sale of oil, it's economic mainstay.
They cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Iraq's agricultural market is huge and very promising for the
exporters of agricultural machines and implements,'' Saleh told The
Associated Press in an interview.
	   He spoke on the fringe of a agricultural trade exhibition that
has attracted 25 foreign firms.
	   Organizers said the Iraqis struck deals for the purchase of
equipment to be imported under the oil-for-food program.
	   The program, an exception to the sanctions, has earmarked dlrs
250 million for agriculture and irrigation projects in Iraq.
	   ``It is nothing when compared with our annual import bill of
dlrs 3 billion before the sanctions,'' Saleh noted.
	   Saleh said a five-year agricultural development plan, to be
implemented after the sanctions are lifted, calls for spending dlrs
1 billion on imports.
	   Saleh said Iraq was making ``some progress'' in boosting its
agricultural output despite the sanctions. He said the country was
self-sufficient in corn and barley but not wheat, dairy products
and poultry.
	   He did not give figures, but U.N. statistics indicate that the
country is harvesting about 1.2 million tons of wheat a year, or
about 2.8 million tons less than it needs.
	   A recent U.N. survey indicated that Iraq's livestock fell to
about 9 million head in 1997 from 16 million in 1990.

Study: Nurse visits to young moms improve child's behavior later
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRENDA C. COLEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Poor women who received regular home counseling
by nurses before and after they gave birth reared children with far
fewer behavioral problems as adolescents, a study found.
	   As 15-year-olds, children of the visited moms ran away less, had
fewer arrests, reported fewer sex partners and drank alcohol less
often than children of the women who were not visited by nurses,
researchers said.
	   The study appears in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
	   The home nurse visits ended when the children were 2, but the
benefits to the mothers and children clearly extended for years,
said the study's lead author, James Olds, a pediatrics professor at
the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.
	   For example, Olds said, helping mothers quit smoking improves
the neurological outlook for unborn babies, which may improve their
behavior as young children.
	   The nurses also helped the women with personal goals and family
planning.
	   Researchers enrolled 400 pregnant women, most of them unmarried
and poor. The women were divided randomly into two groups.
	   One group got an average of nine home visits by nurses trained
in parent education and social services. Women in the other group
were provided transportation to standard prenatal care.
	   The home visits cost about dlrs 2,800 per family per year.
	   Findings are based on data on 315 offspring of the women whom
researchers were able to track to age 15.
	   The study was conducted in the rural and mostly white town of
Elmira, New York, and a companion study started years later among
mostly black women in Memphis, Tennesee, is yielding similar early
results, Olds said.
	   An expert not involved in the study praised its design and said
the findings are good news.
	   But Dr. Felton Earls of Harvard School of Public Health also
said he found some of the data illogical. For example, he said the
study showed children of counseled mothers had more brushes with
police but fewer arrests and convictions.
	   Olds said that particular finding probably was a statistical
fluke.

Police investigating Middle East diplomat's death in Canberra

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A diplomat from a Middle Eastern
country has been found dead in a pool of blood in his apartment in
Australia's capital, police said Wednesday.
	   Australian Federal Police spokesman Eric Meyer said a work
colleague found the middle-aged man dead in an apartment in the
inner-Canberra suburb of Kingston, close to Parliament House, late
on Tuesday.
	   ``At this stage our city crime team is investigating,'' Meyer
said.
	   ``It is still classed as suspicious because we have not
established the circumstances leading up to the death.
	   ``Police conducted a search last night and will continue
today.''
	   Police have not named the diplomat or said what country he
represented in Canberra.

O'Meara, Duval state their case for player of the year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Four victories or two majors?
	   Does a record dlrs 2.4 million, the lowest scoring average and
the most PGA Tour victories stand a chance against someone who has
a green jacket in his closet and a claret jug in the trophy case?
	   Back in July, when Mark O'Meara beat back the winds of Royal
Birkdale and a spirited challenge from Brian Watts to win the
British Open, he appeared to be a lock to win the PGA Tour player
of the year.
	   Having won the Masters with a birdie on the 72nd hole, the
41-year-old O'Meara became only the fifth player in the last 25
years to win two majors in a year, and the oldest player to
accomplish a double major.
	   If that wasn't enough, he threatened to become the first player
since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three majors in a one year until he
was derailed by three straight bogeys in the final round and
finished fourth in the PGA Championship.
	   But golf doesn't begin in April at Augusta, nor does it end in
August in the PGA Championship.
	   And David Duval has proven to be a man for all seasons.
	   He won in Tucson in the winter and added his second victory, the
Shell Houston Open, in the spring. In the summer, he became only
the third player since 1982 to win three times in consecutive years
by taking the World Series of Golf.
	   And the fall? Well, he is Mr. October.
	   Duval, who won his last three tournaments in 1997, returned to
the site of the first one and won the Michelob Championship last
week. It was his fourth victory of the year and his seventh in a
span of 53 weeks, the best stretch of golf since Tom Watson in
1980.
	   O'Meara or Duval?
	   ``It's an awkward position for me to be put in, and I really
couldn't give you an answer,'' Duval said Sunday night on The Golf
Channel.
	   ``I said on Thursday, if I had to vote today I'd vote for Mark
O'Meara,'' he said. ``Now that I've won again, it deserves a little
better, maybe a little longer look.''
	   That look starts with the majors.
	   Since 1973, only Gary Player, Jack Nicklaus, Watson, Nick Faldo
and Nick Price have won two majors in a year.
	   Nicklaus is not considered the greatest player ever because he
won 70 times on tour, but because he won 18 majors. Faldo sought
out David Leadbetter for a swing to withstand the Sunday pressure
of the British Open, not the Peugeot Open.
	   Success in golf is measured only by winning. Greatness is
measured by majors.
	   ``They are what I'm striving for,'' Duval said. ``They're what
Mark O'Meara was striving for, they're what Tiger Woods, Greg
Norman, everybody is striving for.''
	   And they are not easy to win. Until O'Meara won the British
Open, the previous 15 majors had been won by 15 players.
	   The PGA of America recognizes this feat in their player of the
year award, which is based on points and dates to 1948. Majors are
worth 30 points, the World Series and Players Championship are
worth 20 each, and all other tournaments count 10 points. As many
as 20 points are awarded for how a player fares on the money list
and scoring average.
	   Duval would have a 90-86 lead over O'Meara _ except that O'Meara
was awarded a 50-point bonus for winning more than one major in the
same year.
	   The PGA Tour's award is based on a vote by the players. Since
its inception in 1990, the only winners who have not won a major
championship are Wayne Levi in 1990 (Faldo won two majors that year
but was not on the PGA Tour), Fred Couples in 1991 and Greg Norman
in 1995.
	   ``The majors are the most important events,'' Duval said. ``But
you have to look at the span of an entire year.''
	   Even a narrow look at the majors reveals that Duval was not off
by much. He finished one stroke behind O'Meara in the Masters,
having missed a putt of about the same length that O'Meara made.
	   And we haven't closed the books on 1998 yet.
	   Duval has two more titles to defend _ the Disney Classic next
week, followed by the dlrs 4 million Tour Championship. He could
easily become golf's first dlrs 3 million man.
	   And here's another number in Duval's corner: Since the PGA Tour
award began in 1990, Phil Mickelson is the only player to win four
tournaments but fail to win player of the year. The 1996 award
instead went to Tom Lehman, who won the British Open, the Tour
Championship and the money title, and was runner-up in the U.S.
Open.
	   It's worth noting that Duval cast his vote for Mickelson that
year.

Carolina waives Collins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOE MACENKA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (AP) _ Kerry Collins, drafted to be
the cornerstone of the Carolina Panthers, was cut Tuesday, six days
after he said his heart was no longer into being the club's
quarterback.
	   The team announced its decision less than an hour after the
National Football League's trading deadline passed. Carolina spent
several days gauging the interest of other clubs in acquiring the
disgruntled quarterback, but after finding no takers, elected to
waive Collins.
	   The Panthers have lost seven consecutive games, five this year.
That's the longest losing streak in the three-plus years of the
franchise, leaving them with the Washington Redskins (0-6) as the
only teams in the NFL without a victory this year.
	   Collins, 25-21 as Carolina's starter, walked into coach Dom
Capers' office last Wednesday morning and told him he thought it
would be best for the team if someone else were to become the
starting quarterback.
	   Tuesday's move means Collins could be claimed by another team,
which would pick up the remainder of a one-year contract worth dlrs
1.153 million. If Collins is not claimed within 24 hours, he would
become a free agent and could negotiate a new deal with any team.
	   Carolina's decision ends an era that began April 22, 1995, when
the Panthers used their first-ever draft pick on Collins, who
guided Penn State to a 12-0 record as a senior and led the nation
in passing efficiency.
	   ``We got our guy,'' then-general manager Bill Polian proudly
announced.
	   But as a pro, Collins showed only flashes of the brilliance he
displayed in college.
	   He had a 7-6 record as a rookie starter before helping the
Panthers win a division title and advance to the NFC title game in
1997, two feats never before accomplished by a second-year NFL
expansion team. Collins was 10-4 in his second season, which ended
with him being a late invitee to the Pro Bowl.
	   Any chance of a repeat in 1997 seemed to disappear in the
exhibition season, when Collins was sidelined with a broken jaw and
was accused of directing a racial epithet at a black teammate.
	   By the time the year ended, Collins had thrown an NFL-high 21
interceptions and had the league's lowest quarterback rating. The
Panthers, 13-5 a year earlier, slipped to 7-9 and missed the
playoffs.

have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. envoy on Tuesday proclaimed a
breakthrough in efforts to end the Kosovo crisis. But with NATO
planes still poised to strike, he warned President Slobodan
Milosevic must prove his commitment to peace. ``We are not out of
the emergency yet,'' said Richard Holbrooke after wrapping up
weeklong talks with Milosevic. ``We hope that this will mark a
turning point ... but the truth is not in what I am saying here
today, the truth is in compliance.'' In Brussels, NATO sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Milosevic must take four
steps: withdraw special troops from Kosovo immediately, sign an
agreement with the OSCE on the verification mission, sign an
agreement with NATO on the airborne reconnaissance and hammer out a
``framework agreement'' by November outlining future talks with
ethnic Albanians. (YUGOSLAVIA- KOSOVO)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the eve of his departure for a make-or-break
Mideast summit in Washington, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said Tuesday that no deal would be signed on an Israeli troop
pullback following the fatal shooting of a student. The violence
near a communal farm outside Jerusalem underscored the key issue of
Thursday's summit: Netanyahu's demand that the Palestinians do more
to prevent terror attacks against Israelis. ``In light of this
gloomy reality, there is absolutely no chance, at this stage, of
signing an agreement,'' said a statement released by Netanyahu's

gunpowder used to make illegal fireworks Tuesday, obliterating a
two-block area of this central Mexican town and killing at least 10
people and wounding dozens. Rescuers said they expected to find
more bodies as they searched collapsed houses in Tultepec, a town
20 miles (32 kilometers) north of Mexico City known for its
homemade fireworks. Angry residents, apparently fearful that the
explosion would lead to a crackdown on illegal fireworks, blocked
journalists trying to enter the affected area. They said a minor
gas explosion had occurred and that there was nothing to see.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A former intelligence analyst with the
Pentagon's supersecret National Security Agency was charged Tuesday
with selling the Soviet Union top defense secrets, including a
target list for some U.S. nuclear weapons, for dlrs 60,000. Retired
Army Sgt. 1st Class David Sheldon Boone, 46, was arrested Saturday
in a suburban Virginia hotel. He had been lured there from his home
in Germany by a sting operation in which a Russian-speaking former
FBI agent posed as a spy for Russia trying to get Boone to resume
spying, the Justice Department said. Boone told the FBI's fake
Russian spy that, during 1988-1991 in Germany, he sold the Soviets
details of U.S. targets for tactical nuclear weapons in case of a
Soviet nuclear attack and a 300-to 400-page handbook listing
reconnaissance and intelligence collection systems used by the U.S.
military, according to an FBI affidavit. (US-ARMY-SPY CASE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin stayed home Tuesday,
nursing a respiratory infection that forced him to cut short a
foreign trip and revived concerns about his ability to govern.
Yeltsin was spending the day at his Gorky-9 country residence just
outside Moscow, and will probably not go into the office all week,
his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, told reporters. However, Yeltsin's
condition was stable, Yakushkin said. Doctors insisted Monday that
Yeltsin fly home from Central Asia a day ahead of schedule because
he was suffering from an upper respiratory infection and had a mild
fever of 37.4 Celsius (99.3 F). They said Yeltsin was being treated
with antibiotics and there were no plans to hospitalize him.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks halted a three-session rebound Tuesday,
with disappointment over Eastman Kodak's latest quarterly report
weighing down the blue-chip group. The Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 63.33 points _ or by 0.8 percent _ at 7,938.14 after
recovering from a 116-point slide that briefly put the blue-chip
measure below this year's starting point, 7,908.25. Broader indexes
also pulled back, with the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite
posting the biggest loss after bouncing nearly 200 points from
Thursday's low. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   DETROIT (AP) _ General Motors Corp. lost dlrs 809 million in the
third quarter because of two parts plant strikes that virtually
brought its North American production to a halt for several weeks.
The loss disclosed Tuesday amounted to dlrs 1.28 a share and beat
analysts' expectations. GM earned dlrs 1.07 billion, or dlrs 1.35 a
share, during the July-September period of 1997. Revenue for the
world's biggest automaker skidded 18 percent to dlrs 34.4 billion
from dlrs 41.89 billion a year ago. The automaker is just
recovering from the strikes in Flint, the longest of which lasted
nearly eight weeks. The resulting lack of parts forced GM to idle
nearly all of its North American assembly plants in July. The
strikes cost GM dlrs 1.2 billion, or dlrs 1.89 a share, in earnings
during the third quarter. (US-EARNS-GM)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ American Home Products Corp. and Monsanto Co. on
Tuesday called off their proposed dlrs 33.6 billion merger, which
would have been the biggest combination yet in the pharmaceutical
industry. The companies, in their joint announcements, said only
that they were scrapping the deal in the best interests of
shareholders. But Jeffrey Kraws, an analyst with Everen Securities,
said Monsanto told him that the top executives from the two
companies differed on how they wanted to run the combined
companies. Both companies' stock plunged on word the deal was
called off. Drug companies have been racing to combine their
budgets for a better chance of coming up with new blockbuster
drugs. (US-MONSANTO-AMERICAN HOME)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The government may allow foreign banks to provide
retail services in Russia in hopes that such a policy would bring a
flow of deposits from the many Russians who keep their savings at
home, officials said Tuesday. Russians were just beginning to trust
banks over the past year or two, following a series of economic
hits in the early 1990s and the collapse of high-profile pyramid
schemes that carried away their savings. But that trust melted away
when most commercial banks froze accounts in August or started
allowing only limited transactions because of the current crisis.
The government hopes foreign banks will bring the home-kept money
into the economy, because Russians tend to trust them more.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ Aggressive cost-cutting helped
Eastman Kodak Co. boost profit by 72 percent in the third quarter,
but pricing pressures from Japanese rival Fuji contributed to a
sharp downturn in sales. The photography company reported Tuesday
it earned dlrs 398 million, or dlrs 1.21 a diluted share, in the
July-September quarter, up from dlrs 232 million, or 71 cents a
share, in the same period last year. But revenues fell 10 percent
to dlrs 3.42 billion from dlrs 3.79 billion, hurt by asset sales,
the dollar's strength abroad, weak demand in some foreign markets
and a lingering price battle with Tokyo-based Fuji Photo Film Co.
(US-EARNS-KODAK)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The head of the new European Central
Bank said Tuesday that there was no need to lower key interest
rates worldwide in an attempt to correct global financial turmoil.
European Central Bank chief Wim Duisenberg, who heads the powerful
body setting financial policy for the single European currency to
be launched Jan. 1, said dropping interest rates would compound
uncertainties underlying the market volatility. ``Recent calls for
worldwide, uniform interest rate reductions are inappropriate as
they do not address the very nature of the problems,'' said
Duisenberg, the former Dutch central banker. Rather, he said, the
world financial system needed structural improvements such as
enhancing transparency in the public and private sectors and
strengthening domestic banking systems. (GERMANY-EURO)

Nobel Economics Prize shadowed by laureates' meltdown
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Prize to be announced at 0930 GMT at the earliest. &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ As the one Nobel Prize that wasn't
specified in Alfred Nobel's will, the economics award has often
been regarded uneasily, and the prize's shadow has been darkened by
the meltdown of last year's laureates.
	   Americans Robert Merton and Myron Scholes won the 1997 prize for
their work on how to value so-called ``derivatives'' such as stock
options. The award caught the attention of many because it
recognized work with clear practical applications, rather than the
highly theoretical work that usually gets the prize.
	   However, their work was tarnished last month when the hedge fund
in which they were partners, Long -Term Capital Management, went
bust, necessitating a dlrs 3.6 billion bailout.
	   It's not clear whether Long-Term Capital's failure was due to
misapplication of Merton's and Scholes' theories or whether the
theories themselves are faulty. But the debacle inevitably taints a
prize that many have criticized.
	   The economics prize was not established in Nobel's will and was
established in 1968, marking the 300-year anniversary of Sweden's
central bank. Creating the prize offended those who believe Nobel's
will should be followed to the letter.
	   The economics prize, to be announced Wednesday, is the fifth of
the six Nobels to be given this year, and the last one announced in
Stockholm. The peace prize, the last in this year's series, is to
be announced on Friday in Oslo, Norway.
	   Each prize is worth 7.6 million kronor (dlrs 978,000).
	   The physics prize was won Tuesday by three researchers at
American universities _ Robert B. Laughlin, Horst L. Stormer and
Daniel C. Tsui _ for their discovery that electrons in strong
magnetic fields act in unexpected ways, including creating a new
form of ``quantum fluid.''
	   The chemistry prize on Tuesday went to Walter Kohn and John A.
Pople _ also affiliated with American institutions _ for advances
in quantum chemistry.
	   On Monday, the medicine prize was given to three Americans _
Robert Furchgott, Louis Ignarro and Ferid Murad _ for their work on
discovering properties of nitric oxide, a common air pollutant but
also a life-saver because of its capacity to dilate blood vessels.
	   The literature prize was awarded last Thursday to Portuguese
novelist Jose Saramago.
	   The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the
death of Nobel, the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite.

Dying boom towns send gold miners deeper into Amazon jungles

<TEXT>
	   LAS NUEVAS CLARITAS, Venezuela (AP) _ ``Guarico'' is lounging in
a hammock near gigantic Amazonian gold deposits where he has spent
11 years searching for his jackpot.
	   But far from counting his riches, he's ticking off the days
before he quits this one-time boom town that's going bust.
	   ``I'm not doing anything. I've been defeated,'' says the
25-year-old gold hunter.
	   The Amazon rain forests of eastern Venezuela used to be a place
where a poor man with a pick and shovel could strike it rich _ or
at least dream of it.
	   But now the government is chasing illegal miners off some of the
best land to make way for international companies that have
concessions to mine for gold.
	   That has environmentalists worried that miners are moving to
untapped lands where they will leave more paths of destruction.
	   The miners ``may cause even worse damage if they aren't located
in areas where they can be controlled,'' said Jorge Padron, head of
the National Ecological and Social Union.
	   Thousands of miners flooded into the Imataca rain forest in the
1980s. They searched for gold that over the centuries has attracted
explorers like Sir Walter Raleigh, who sought the legendary golden
city of ``El Dorado.''
	   In Imataca they built a frontier town called Las Claritas on top
of what is believed to be the richest gold deposit in Latin
America. The town grew to 10,000 people, including entire families.
They came from as far as Colombia, Brazil and the Dominican
Republic and built houses out of plastic sheets and wooden poles.
	   Each day they dug out rocks, put them into sacks and trudged to
a mill where gold was separated from dirt. Everyone had good days
and bad. Yet during the boom, miners earned as much as dlrs 5,000 a
month at a time when the average worker in Venezuela made about
dlrs 200.
	   At the center of Las Claritas they erected a statue of a miner
with a pick in his hand and a dog at his side. In their minds they
were pioneers, like the men and women who conquered the Wild West
in the United States.
	   But ecologists said the miners destroyed the environment with
mercury and high-pressure water hoses used to uproot trees.
Government officials complained it was impossible to collect taxes
or control the miners, whose village was rife with drugs, violence
and prostitution.
	   Several years ago, authorities forced Las Claritas' residents to
relocate a few miles (kilometers) away. The new town _ Las Nuevas
Claritas _ prospered at first. But then the government sold rights
to the prized mining site to Canada's Placer Dome and other mining
companies.
	   Today, Las Nuevas Claritas is fading. It used to boast a couple
dozen ore mills. Now there are two.
	   One of them, where Guarico works, used to operate 24 hours a
day. Now it cranks up no more than six hours. The amount of gold
sacks processed is down from 600 a day to 50. The town's population
has dwindled to 3,000.
	   Falling international gold prices have contributed to the hard
times.
	   ``Before it was a situation of bonanza. There was lots of gold
and it was easy,'' said miner Juan Tremeria. ``Now we have a
situation where people are going hungry.''
	   Few miners have fortunes stashed away from gold's heyday.
	   Most blew their money on alcohol, prostitutes and wild parties
in the remote jungle village, where goods were expensive. The gold
diggers, like the rest of Venezuela that was experiencing an oil
boom, neglected to save for a rainy day.
	   Nowadays, a miner is lucky if he makes dlrs 400- dlrs 500 a
month.
	   Officials say bringing in dozens of companies to the mining
areas will provide thousands of jobs and decrease ecological
damage. The companies use sophisticated technology and will run
programs to teach illegal miners better techniques, they argue.
	   Environmentalists contend the companies will overwhelm the
forest. And they question the government's claims about jobs and
training programs.
	   Some miners are already heading to new sites not sold to the
mining companies, such as the fragile areas around the river
headwaters that feed the Guri Dam, one of the world's largest
hydroelectric plants.
	   Padron and other environmentalists charge that National
Guardsmen are collecting bribes from illegal miners to allow them
to operate in the new areas. Officials don't deny the allegation
and say they are working to curb corruption.
	   The invasion of new territories may leave another ``disaster in
the middle of the pristine forest,'' said Clemencia Rodner of the

Koran schools a Pakistani breeding ground for Islamic militants

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ The call to prayer wails. Young boys
put aside their study of the Koran to shake out their prayer rugs
and kneel, face down, toward Mecca.
	   For these students, life is simple.
	   Their days are spent praying and studying the Koran, the Muslim
holy book.
	   But when they leave Pakistan's exploding number of small,
private religious schools, they have few skills that will help them
get jobs. Many remain unemployed, surviving on occasional manual
labor.
	   Some people believe the schools are creating a growing pool of
Pakistanis easily recruited to extremist Islamic causes.
	   Most of the Koran students come from Pakistan's poorest
families, who send their children because the institutions feed and
care for them as well as provide an education.
	   But the education is often limited. Many of the schools teach
only the Koran and stress the responsibilities of Muslims to fight
for Islam.
	   Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's government tried to
reduce government funds to the religious schools and current Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif sought to regulate curriculum. But the
efforts were derailed by small right-wing religious parties.
	   Pakistani authorities say nearly 4,000 religious schools are
registered in the country, with 540,000 students. But thousands
more unregistered schools are believed to exist, turning out
students who go on to fight for Islamic parties in Afghanistan's
civil war and may be ready to join other militant movements.
	   Nasrullah Babaar, who as Pakistan's former interior minister was
in charge of the national police, views some religious schools as
``hotbeds of terrorism.''
	   ``All this is a carryover from the Afghan jihad (holy war),'' he
said in an interview. Now, he said, some graduates are involved in
fighting between Pakistani Shiite and Sunni Muslim groups that has
caused hundreds of deaths in recent years.
	   ``The fact is that it affects the entire society ... you can see
the result in the sectarian clashes that take place,'' Babaar said.
``It wouldn't be happening otherwise.''
	   Teachers at Markaz-Uloom-e-Islamia, a combination school and
mosque, say they teach their students the Koran and the obligation
to fight for Islam at home and abroad.
	   Such schools graduated thousands of Afghan ``mujahedeen'' _
freedom fighters _ who battled the Soviet Red Army in the 1980s in
Afghanistan. And now they boast of schooling the men who make up
the backbone of the Taliban religious army that has won control of
most of Afghanistan in recent years.
	   ``There are not only Afghan Taliban but there also are Pakistan
Taliban ... there are no frontiers in Islam,'' said Qari Shabir
Ahmed, head teacher at Markaz-Uloom-e-Islamia.
	   Taliban authorities have imposed a restrictive vision of Islamic
law in Afghanistan that forbids most forms of light entertainment
and bars women from working, girls from going to school and men
from mingling with women other than their wives.
	   The Taliban movement has drawn U.S. criticism for harboring
Saudi militant Osama bin Laden and his followers, who are believed
by Washington to have masterminded the bombings of two American
embassies in East Africa.
	   Ahmed said his students are duty bound to join bin Laden in his
war against the United States.
	   ``We stress peace, but if there is a hurdle to Islam, then it is
their duty to fight,'' he said.
	   And the fight isn't just in foreign lands, militants say.
	   In Pakistan, disillusionment with a struggling democracy and
soaring unemployment have stirred calls for an Islamic revolution.
The religious right wing, while weak in Parliament, has
traditionally been the catalyst for street demonstrations that have
toppled governments.
	   In Peshawar in September, religious leader Fazle ur-Rehman
warned that his group was ready to lead a revolution. Thousands of
banner-waving young men demanding a government based on Islamic
teachings massed for Rehman's speech.
	   At a religious school in Akora Khattak, outside Peshawar, Sami
ul-Haq, a Muslim cleric and senator in the upper house of
Parliament, issued a religious edict threatening to launch a holy
war if the government signs the nuclear test ban treaty.
	   Many militants want Pakistan to continue development of nuclear
weapons, both as a deterrent to longtime enemy India and as an
equalizer for the Islamic world in its dealings with the West.
	   For students at the religious schools their commitment is to the
Koran. Their teachers tell them that means enforcing their version
of Islam with whatever it takes, including violence.
	   ``We are struggling for Islam in Pakistan like in Afghanistan,''
said one 17-year-old student, Abdul Ghaffar. ``It is our duty to
enforce it using any means.''

U.S. warning list is long on Libyan-linked businesses in Malta

<TEXT>
	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ No matter how stubborn the stain, U.S.
diplomats boycott what many people consider the best dry cleaners
in town.
	   Buying a loaf of one of Malta's best-selling breads potentially
could land American visitors in jail or a dlrs 250,000 fine.
	   Paying for a stay at certain hotels on this tourist-destination
island also puts Americans technically at risk for prosecution. So
does eating at Malta University's cafeteria for exchange students
from the United States.
	   From a caterer's kitchens to a fish market's stalls to a
waterfront lined with restaurants and nightclubs, Malta has myriad
businesses on a U.S. government ``blacklist'' of companies that
Washington contends are either owned or controlled by Libya.
	   For some years, Libya has maintained considerable investment on
Malta, which is only 375 kilometers (225 miles) away out in the
Mediterranean, and the island attracts Libyan tourists.
	   In addition, because of a U.N. ban on air travel to and from
Libya, many Libyans take the ferry to Malta to catch flights to the
rest of the Europe.
	   Washington imposed a ban on Americans doing business with Libyan
enterprises in 1986 as punishment for Libya's alleged sponsorship
of international terrorism.
	   But unless American tourists wander into the U.S. Embassy, on
the third-floor of an office building just outside Valletta's
bastion walls, and ask for a copy of the ``blacklisted''
businesses, they are unlikely to know which establishments are
affected.
	   It's clear the U.S. government's main concern is keeping watch
for possible sanctions violations by American companies.
	   ``We work with the U.S. business community, exporters and
importers, banking'' and tour operator associations, Richard
Newcomb, director of the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of
Foreign Assets Control, said in a telephone interview from
Washington.
	   Credit card companies are also warned, so Malta's hoteliers know
some run the risk of unpaid bills if an American tourist pays with
a credit card.
	   With American tourism just starting to grow on the island
nation, the ban could get costly for Malta, whose largest revenue
comes from holidaygoers.
	   ``We very much wish to have the American business,'' said Alfred
Fabri, director of the Corinthia Group of Companies, which form the
bulk of the Maltese businesses on Washington's no-dealings list.
	   As sunlight poured past potted palms in the lobby of the
five-star Corinthia San Gorg Hotel and guests breakfasted on a
terrace overlooking three swimming pools cascading down to the sea,
Corinthia's top executive, Alfred Pisani, said Americans are
encouraged to book elsewhere on the island and make up at most 2
percent of the hotel's guests.
	   ``We say in advance, `It's going to be embarrassing for you,'''
Pisani said.
	   Pisani's company started as a family-run Maltese restaurant in
1962. But thanks in large part to a dlrs 3.5 million Libyan
investment in 1974, it has grown into a multinational concern with
hotels in Turkey, Tunisia, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
	   In March, after Corinthia purchased the high-rise Forum in
Prague, organizers of the Czech city's spring classical music
festival had to scramble to find other rooms for the Detroit
Symphony Orchestra. A few days earlier, the U.S. Embassy in Prague
warned Americans they would be breaking U.S. law if they lodged at
the Forum.
	   A large American jeans manufacturer had to yank its business
from Corinthia, whose laundries stonewashed the garments.
	   Pisani says Libya's share of Corinthia holdings amounts to 48
percent and the government of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has no
say in how the business is run.
	   A Treasury Department spokeswoman, Beth Weaver, said she was
unaware of any indictment stemming from a sanctions violations
involving Malta-based companies.
	   Last spring, a local newspaper noted American exchange students
at Malta University might be violating U.S. sanctions by lunching
at the campus cafeteria, which is supplied by Corinthia. But meal
time went on as usual.
	   ``I suspect if the American Embassy found this worrisome, it
would have done something,'' said Leslie Agius, director of the
international students' program. ``Nothing happened.''

In a crazy year, Braves have reason to believe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BEN WALKER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Baseball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Even the Atlanta Braves know it's crazy to think
they might become the first team in major league baseball history
to overcome a three-game deficit in the postseason.
	   Why, that kind of thing just doesn't happen in baseball.
	   It would be like dreaming someone could hit 70 home runs. Or
believing a rookie could strike out 20 batters. Or _ and this is
getting silly, isn't it? _ imagining Cal Ripken would ask for a day
off.
	   Or picturing Greg Maddux and Kevin Brown pitching in relief in
the same game, come to think of it.
	   ``It seems like it's been that kind of year, so why not?''
Atlanta starter Denny Neagle said.
	   The Braves moved into position to pull off the wildly
improbable, rallying two straight days to cut the San Diego Padres'
lead in the NL championship series to 3-2.
	   Atlanta hopes to tie the series Wednesday in Game 6 at Turner
Field. Tom Glavine is scheduled to start for the Braves against
Sterling Hitchcock, moved up a day because of Brown's relief
appearance Monday night.
	   The Padres got one piece of good news during Tuesday's workout.
Greg Vaughn, the 50-homer man who has not started since leaving
Game 1 because of a strained left quadriceps, is expected to return
to the lineup as San Diego tries to wrap up its first trip to the
World Series since 1984.
	   ``Obviously, it is not the position we wanted to be in,''
Glavine said. ``But we felt we had a chance and we still do because
of our pitching and how we are starting to swing the bats. We feel
if anyone can come back from 3-0, we can.''
	   Down to their final five outs Monday night at San Diego, the
Braves came back for a 7-6 win that fit right into this year's
theme of wild and wacky.
	   Looking to avoid a trip back to Atlanta, Padres manager Bruce
Bochy gambled and brought in Brown for just his third relief
appearance ever, hoping his ace could give him two strong innings.
	   But Brown, who had been set to start Game 6, gave up a three-run
homer in the eighth to Michael Tucker that put Atlanta ahead for
good. Brown wound up throwing 41 pitches, meaning he'll now pitch
Game 7, if necessary, against Maddux.
	   ``I feel bad about that second inning because it opens up Bruce
to second-guessing,'' Brown said.
	   Braves manager Bobby Cox did not hesitate, either, after closer
Kerry Ligtenberg gave up a two-run homer to pinch-hitter Greg Myers
that made it 7-6 with no outs in the ninth.
	   Cox summoned Maddux, who had not relieved since 1987. The
four-time Cy Young winner got two quick outs, then issued a rare
walk before retiring Tony Gwynn on a game-ending grounder for the
first save of his pro career.
	   ``I think it's the first time I've ever pitched in relief where
it actually counted,'' Maddux said. ``I was like a fish out of
water. I didn't know what to do, how to act. It was weird.''
	   The narrow victory buoyed the Braves, who became the first team
to win twice after falling behind 3-0 in a postseason series. Of
the previous 21 clubs facing such deficits, 18 were swept and the
other three lost in Game 5.
	   The Braves are hoping that Turner Field, which had at least
8,000 empty seats for the first two games of the series, will be
filled when the Padres return.
	   ``People are going to say they went for the knockout blow and
they didn't land it,'' Atlanta pitcher John Smoltz said. ``But
let's be clear about this _ we're still trailing. We're not in good
shape. We're just alive.''
	   Besides, they'll still have to face Brown, 6-0 with a 1.85 ERA
in his last eight starts against Atlanta.
	   ``I feel a lot better than I would if we had won and if Brown
hadn't pitched,'' Smoltz said. ``Their rotation would have been
set. Still, he's Kevin Brown. We'll have to beat him somewhere
along the line.
	   ``Put it this way: If he beats us in Game 7 at our place to go
to the World Series, we'll tip 18 caps to him, maybe 25,'' he said.

	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ Costa Rica's new president says
there's nothing wrong with putting relatives on the payroll _ as
long as they're qualified for the jobs.
	   La Republica newspaper reported Tuesday that Miguel Angel
Rodriguez, who took office in May, has appointed six family members
to government positions, including a son and brother named as
advisers and a cousin appointed ambassador to Germany.
	   ``Whenever relatives meet the requirements, are professionals in
their field _ and I'm sure that they are _ I don't see any
problem,'' Rodriguez was quoted as saying.
	   Costa Rica, a Central American country of about 3.3 million
people, has no laws prohibiting the president from appointing
relatives.
	   ``In such a small country, we're all relatives,'' he said.
	   ___
	   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) _ Gunmen killed six people and injured one
other in Tijuana early Tuesday in a possible drug hit.
	   The killings occurred in the poor community of El Pipila in the
southern part of the city near the U.S. border. Police said they
found three bodies inside one car, one in a second car and two in
front of nearby houses.
	   Police spokeswoman Lauro Ortiz said the shootings may have been
drug-related.
	   Two people have been arrested and police said they confiscated a
rifle and ammunition.

	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Toll revenues at the Panama Canal
increased about 10 percent in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30,
said a report released Tuesday by the U.S. agency that administers
the canal.
	   The higher revenues were partly the result of a 7.5 percent toll
increase that took effect in January.
	   The canal earned dlrs 545.7 million in the 1998 fiscal year,
compared with dlrs 493.6 million the previous fiscal year, the
Canal Commission report said.
	   The canal, built in 1914, will be returned to Panama on Dec. 31,
1999.

Police exhume sixth body in murder case against doctor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Police investigating a doctor charged with
murdering four of his women patients for their money said they have
exhumed a sixth body believed to be connected with the case.
	   Detectives are investigating the deaths of a further 24 of Dr.
Harold Shipman's former patients. They charged him with the murders
of the four women after exhuming their bodies. They exhumed a fifth
body on Monday and said Tuesday they have exhumed a sixth body in
the case.
	   Shipman, 52, a family doctor from Hyde in Greater Manchester,
northern England, was charged Sept. 7 with murdering 81-year-old
widow Kathleen Grundy, falsely obtaining cash and property worth
300,000 pounds (dlrs 500,000) from her estate and forging a will
and two letters.
	   He was charged with murdering three more former patients after
police exhumed their bodies last month. He appeared in court
Tuesday, but made no request for bail.
	   All of the women died between December last year and June of
this year.
	   Police exhumed from Hyde Cemetery the body of 67-year-old Marie
Quinn on Tuesday. They exhumed the body of 63-year-old Ivy Lomas on
Monday.
	   Police would not confirm media reports that the investigation
will involve further exhumations, including one in Malta.

Lightning fire general manager Phil Esposito
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ The Esposito Era is over in Tampa Bay.
	   In a surprise move Tuesday, the team with the National Hockey
League's worst record last season fired Hall of Famers Phil and
Tony Esposito in a front office shakeup by owner Art Williams.
	   Coach Jacques Demers, who shared responsibility for personnel
decisions equally with Phil Esposito, will replace his former
colleague as general manager. He will hire an assistant GM to fill
Tony Esposito's vacancy.
	   Don Murdoch, the team's head scout, will become the director of
player personnel _ a title previously held by Demers.
	   ``In our situation right now, I just feel like the head coach
having the ability to handle both of those jobs gives us what we
need,'' Williams said. ``That might not be what we do long range,
but right now it's absolutely the best way to go.''
	   Phil Esposito, who had been with the team since its inception
seven seasons ago, generally is regarded as the man who brought the
NHL to Florida.
	   He lobbied for the expansion franchise, put the team together
and sold the game to fans who had had limited exposure to hockey.
He gradually watched his influence diminish after Williams
purchased the team earlier this year.
	   Although the decision to dismiss him and his brother caught Phil
off guard, he insisted he leaves the team with no hard feelings.
	   ``It's the nature of the business,'' Esposito said by telephone.
``I'm not mad. The only thing I regret is not being able to
continue bringing the franchise around.''
	   Williams bought the team from Japanese-owned Kokusai Green for
dlrs 117 million in June. Many of the franchise's problems have
been blamed on tight budgets the Lightning operated under the past
six seasons.
	   One of the new owner's first acts was to increase the payroll
budget by dlrs 6 million for this season. In addition, he said he
would retain the current front office structure for a year to give
Esposito and Demers a chance to turn the franchise around.
	   Williams said Tuesday that the decision to ask the general
manager and coach to equally share responsibility for personnel and
other decisions was a mistake.
	   ``Early on I could see it just wasn't working right. As the
weeks rolled along, there was tremendous conflict,'' Williams said.
``I saw Jacques questioning Phil, Phil questioning Jacques and just
things you can't do. You got to have one leader. There's got to be
one person responsible and we didn't have that.''
	   Tampa Bay (0-1-1) finished last season with a 17-55-10 record,
by far the poorest in the league.
	   Before joining the Lightning, Phil Esposito was general manager
of the New York Rangers from 1986-88. Tony Esposito was GM of the
Pittsburgh Penguins from 1988-89 before coming to Tampa in 1991.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One Russian newspaper claims Boris Yeltsin has had
five heart attacks. Another says the Russian leader is sometimes
unsure whether he's in the Kremlin. A third speculates he's in the
early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
	   Yeltsin's shaky health and the sketchy information doled out by
his advisers have created another cloud of uncertainty over a
nation struggling to cope with economic crisis. But they've been a
boon to Russia's press, which freely traffics in gossip, rumors and
conspiracies surrounding the president's fitness.
	   While the 67-year-old Yeltsin recuperated Tuesday from what
aides described as bronchitis and a mild fever, the media was
probing the possibility of a presidential resignation.
	   ``It's not being discussed,'' Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitry
Yakushkin, said of any talk of resignation.
	   Yeltsin has consistently provided fodder to critics who say he
is unfit to lead Russia out of its worst economic tailspin since
the Soviet Union collapsed seven years ago.
	   With the media scrutinizing his first foreign trip in six
months, Yeltsin stumbled and nearly fell shortly after arriving in
Uzbekistan on Sunday. He canceled meetings. He cut short a press
conference.
	   He returned home a day early on Monday due to illness,
retreating to Gorky-9, his country residence outside Moscow, where
he now spends most of his time.
	   The deputy head of the presidential administration, Sergei
Prikhodko, told the Interfax news agency that he and Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov were briefing Yeltsin regularly _ up to 10
p.m. Tuesday, at Yeltsin's request _ about the Kosovo crisis.
	   Yeltsin's extended absences from the Kremlin during the current
turmoil ``amount to a state catastrophe,'' the Nezavisimaya Gazeta
newspaper said Tuesday in a front-page editorial. It called on
Yeltsin to surrender most of his powers to Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov.
	   Kommersant, the country's leading business daily, said Yeltsin
appeared disoriented at times during his visit to Central Asia.
	   ``The president didn't seem to understand that he wasn't in
Moscow,'' Kommersant wrote. The president reprimanded aides as
though they were late for work at the Kremlin, it said.
	   The robust Yeltsin of the early 1990s has become a man who walks
stiffly, speaks slowly and disappears from public view for days at
a time.
	   Yeltsin's doctors say the president has no major health problems
and Yeltsin has vowed to serve out his term, which runs two more
years. The media, meanwhile, have their own theories.
	   ``The health of the president constitutes one of the most
dreadful secrets of Russian authority,'' the popular daily
Moskovsky Komsomolets wrote last month. ``It is a sacredly held
secret, more closely held than all classified military information
lumped together.''
	   The Kremlin has lost credibility by offering only limited, and
sometimes blatantly inaccurate, information on the president's
health.
	   The most serious offense occurred shortly before Yeltsin's 1996
reelection, when the president vanished and the official line was
that he had a sore throat. It was a heart attack, his doctors later
conceded.
	   Against this backdrop, Kremlin reports on Yeltsin's health are
treated with deep skepticism.
	   In recent television footage, two small bandages were visible on
the back of Yeltsin's right hand. That immediately sparked rumors
he had been receiving intravenous drug treatments. When asked, the
Kremlin said the president had suffered small burns.
	   ``Suffice it to say that President Yeltsin has suffered ... five
heart attacks ... and more than 10 incidents of cardiac seizure,''
Moskovsky Komsomolets said, without naming a single source.
	   Yeltsin now faces unflattering comparisons to the late Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev, whose doddering manner made his name
synonymous with stagnation.
	   Yeltsin ``often gives incoherent answers to simple questions,''
psychiatrist Mikhail Vinogradov wrote last week in Nezavisimaya
Gazeta. ``In the past, he would usually realize that he said
something stupid. Recently, he hasn't even been noticing that.''
	   Vinogradov, who has never examined Yeltsin, still offered a
medical diagnosis.
	   ``What I see gives grounds to believe there is an intellectual
disorder,'' he wrote. ``It's also possible that there is an early
stage of Alzheimer's disease.''
	   Yeltsin's spokesman just shrugged.
	   ``Generally speaking, it's unethical for a doctor to comment on
someone's health without seeing the patient,'' Yakushkin said
Tuesday. ``It also remains unclear what kind of doctors they are.''

Dollar higher, Tokyo stocks rebound moderately in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen early
Wednesday, largely maintaining its strength in overseas markets.
Japanese stock prices rose.
	   The dollar bought 119.02 yen in early trading, up 0.64 yen from
late Tuesday in Tokyo but slightly below its late New York level of
119.15 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 176.33 points,
or 1.33 percent, to 13,419.12 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Tuesday, the Nikkei closed down 312.22 points, or 2.30
percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar gained support from comments by
U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, who reiterated
that a strong dollar is in the United States' best interests.
	   The comment gave some relief to investors after the U.S.
currency plunged last week and some officials had expressed concern
about the yen's weakness.
	   On Tuesday, both Eisuke Sakakibara, the Japanese Finance
Ministry's vice minister of international affairs, and Summers
attributed last week's volatility to hedge fund liquidations,
rather than to economic fundamentals.
	   On the stock market, many investors were holding back as they
continued monitoring developments in Japanese government measures
aimed at banking reform and also possible fresh economic stimulus
steps.
	   On Tuesday, the lower house of Japan's Parliament passed a bill
that would let the government pump taxpayer money into banks to
induce them to lend more. The bill is expected to pass the upper
house on Friday.
	   The problem of Japan's debt-saddled banks is a major factor
behind the nation's deepest recession in decades. Unless quickly
resolved, economists say the crisis could further affect
economically devastated Asian countries and slow growth globally.
	   The market's current focus is on the conditions under which the
government would disburse public funds to weak but viable banks,
traders said.
	   ``There are still many uncertain elements in the banking reforms
before we feel relieved,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager of the
stock division at Ryoko Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 6.98 points, or 0.70 percent, to 1,005.96. The
TOPIX closed down 24.36 points, or 2.38 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 0.820 percent from Tuesday's finish of
0.830 percent, driving its price up to 108.77 yen from 108.68 yen.

	   DENVER (AP) _ Five scientists in the United States won Nobel
Prizes in physics and chemistry for unlocking the strange behavior
of subatomic particles in ways that might someday be harnessed to
make faster electronics and design new drugs via computer.
	   Both prizes, awarded Tuesday in Stockholm by the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences, reward the scientists for research done as
much as three decades ago.
	   Robert B. Laughlin of Stanford University, Horst L. Stormer of
Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton University won
the physics prize for discovering how electrons can change behavior
and act more like fluid than particles.
	   ``The first time I saw it was just mind blowing,'' Stormer said.
But he added, ``Had someone stood behind me and said, `This is a
Nobel Prize,' I would have laughed in his face.''
	   Walter Kohn of the University of California at Santa Barbara and
John Pople of Northwestern University were awarded the chemistry
prize for developing ways of analyzing molecules in chemical
reactions.
	   The prize in each category is worth dlrs 978,000. The winners
will share the money.
	   ``I feel shaky. My wife is trying to steady me,'' Kohn, 75, said
after receiving an early morning telephone call with the news.
	   Kohn, an Austrian-born American, and has taught at U.S.
institutions since 1950, was cited for developing during the 1960s
a simplified way of describing mathematically the bonds between
atoms in a molecule.
	   This has enabled scientists to study large molecules that
previously were too complex and unwieldy to understand.
	   Pople, a 72-year-old British citizen who joined the Northwestern
faculty in 1986, developed computer techniques for analyzing
chemical structures. The resulting computer program is used by
thousands of universities and companies worldwide.
	   His approach allows scientists to create computer models of
chemical reactions that are difficult or impossible to recreate in
the laboratory.
	   It has a wide range of applications, from studying far-off
galaxies according to the radiation they emit, to testing how
pollutants such as Freon react with the ozone layer.
	   Medical researchers use Pople's method to simulate the
biochemical effects of proposed drugs, such as medicines to fight
the AIDS virus.
	   The Nobel winners in physics discovered that ordinary electrons,
when exposed to strong magnetic fields and ultra-low temperatures,
can condense into a new form of matter that behaves like a fluid.
	   Whether this ``quantum fluid'' of subatomic particles has
practical potential is a matter of debate. But Mats Jonson, a
physics professor at Sweden's Chalmers Institute of Technology,
said the research work could boost the development of smaller,
faster electronics.
	   Electrons moving in waves could change the flow of data through
chips and transistors for computers and cellular phones of the
future.
	   Tsui, a 59-year-old Chinese-born American, and Stormer, a
49-year-old German, did the ``quantum fluid'' work together in
1982. Laughlin, a 47-year-old American, described the underpinning
theory the next year.
	   The Nobel Prizes were established in the will of Alfred Nobel,
the Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite. The winner in
economics to be named on Wednesday, and the peace prize will be
awarded on Friday.

Heading into Mideast summit, all sides have reason to need accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ For the first time in a generation, an American
president is poised to usher Israeli and Palestinian leaders to a
secluded setting outside the U.S. capital, sit them down, and tell
them in the plainest possible terms that it's time to work out
their differences.
	   Although few believe a landmark Camp David-style accord is
likely to emerge from this week's summit at the Maryland resort of
Wye Plantation, the two sides could be pushed into some successful
outcome _ largely because neither side can afford any more
diplomatic false starts.
	   Not to mention that their host, President Bill Clinton, could
sorely use a feat of statesmanship to assuage his impeachment woes.
	   In recent months, one high-level, high-profile Mideast gathering
after another _ in London, in Washington, in the Gaza Strip _
yielded little more than agreements to meet again. Painting that as
progress might have worked for a time, but this time, it would be
read as clear failure.
	   Nabil Abourdeineh, an adviser to Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, likened the situation to ``standing on top of a volcano.''
	   ``Either we reach a breakthrough or a dangerous deadlock,'' he
told reporters Tuesday, on the eve of both leaders' departures for
Washington.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, too, finds himself facing
narrower options than at almost any time since taking power two
years ago.
	   Extreme-right elements in his coalition have vowed to topple the
government if Netanyahu agrees to further troop pullbacks in the
West Bank. Those threats swelled to a crescendo Tuesday during a
marathon Cabinet meeting.
	   But an agreement with the Palestinians, even a modest one, could
translate into strong support at the polls from the solid majority
of Israelis who want to make peace. Netanyahu has told right-wing
politicians if they oust him for signing a withdrawal pact, he is
confident of winning a subsequent election.
	   The circumstances of this summit _ the Camp David-like setting,
the determination to isolate the parties from the news media to
prevent leaks and grandstanding, the personal intercession of the
president _ might seem more fitting for a grand finale, a drive
toward a broad overall Mideast settlement.
	   Instead, the deal on the negotiating table _ an Israeli pullback
from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian
security pledges _ is relatively small in scope. But a chance to
end a 19-month deadlock would considerably sweeten any agreement.
	   The long impasse has created an atmosphere of bitterness and
mistrust on both sides.
	   It's a far cry from the leap of faith that took place in 1978,
when Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin struck accords that altered the balance of power in
the Middle East.
	   ``In contrast to Camp David, the atmosphere on the eve of the
Wye summit is filled with suspicion and question marks,'''
commentator Moshe Zak wrote in the Maariv daily.
	   There is a chance, of course, that one or both sides will make
promises they subsequently find too hard to keep.
	   At the summit, Israel plans to demand that Arafat disarm Islamic
militants and extradite those accused of attacks against Israel _
steps he has been reluctant to take for fear of a public backlash.
	   The Palestinians have openly said that whatever Netanyahu agrees
to, they will remain skeptical until a pullback is actually carried
out.
	   They have also been disappointed that the Clinton administration
has not publicly chastised Israel for its failure thus far to
accept the American-authored pullback plan that is to be discussed.
	   But if the president was reluctant earlier to alienate the
Democrats' pro-Israel constituency, he is doubly unlikely to do so
now at a time of domestic political crisis. Sensing that, the
Palestinians have eased off in their calls for such a condemnation.

Sanctions committee chief suggests flexibility in Libya measures
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The chairman of the U.N. committee
overseeing sanctions against Libya suggested some flexibility in
the measures following continued violations of the U.N. flight ban,
diplomatic sources said.
	   In a closed Security Council meeting on Tuesday, Danilo Turk of
Slovenia suggested the sanctions committee consider being more
willing to approve requests for a waiver of the ban by heads of
state who want to fly into Libya, the diplomats said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   There was no indication that the committee would approve the
suggestion, or that the idea would even be formally proposed. There
is, however, widespread concern within the Security Council that
its authority is being undermined by continued violations of the
flight ban, particularly by African nations.
	   The Organization of African Unity announced in June that it
would no longer abide by the air embargo.
	   There have been several violations since then. Earlier this
month, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi presented 11 African leaders
with medals of honor in appreciation for violating the embargo.
	   The U.N. committee allowed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to
fly to Tripoli in July, but the committee waiver was believed to
have been based on humanitarian grounds because Mubarak was flying
with a medical team to check on the health of Gadhafi, who had
recently undergone a hip operation.
	   In an effort to end the violations, Turk met with the
ambassadors of Mali, Niger and Chad, whose countries had all
recently violated the ban. Turk told the council on Tuesday that he
had received letters from each of their governments stating that
yes, they had indeed violated the embargo, but did so because the
OAU said they could, the diplomats said.
	   Turk's suggestion came as part of a general discussion to try to
figure out a way to preserve the integrity of the ban, diplomats
said.
	   The U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions that ban direct
flights to and from Libya in 1992 to try to force Gadhafi to
surrender two Libyans wanted in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am
passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   The council has agreed to suspend the sanctions once Libya turns
the men over for a trial by Scottish judges according to Scottish
law in the Netherlands.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A fairly strong earthquake struck near the coast of
northern Japan Wednesday morning, but there were no immediate
reports of damage or injuries.
	   The earthquake was centered just below the Pacific Ocean seabed
about 50 kilometers (31 miles) off the cost of Iwate prefecture, or
state, the Meteorological Agency said.
	   The location of the temblor, which hit at 5:41 a.m. (2041 GMT
Tuesday), is about 550 kilometers (341 miles), northeast of Tokyo.
	   There was no fear of tsunami, or seismic waves caused by
undersea disturbances such as volcanic activity or undersea
earthquakes, arising from the quake, the agency said.
	   It was felt in several coastal towns in both Iwate and nearby
prefectures, the agency said.
	   A magnitude 5-level quake can cause damage to homes if it occurs
in a residential area.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa _ A plea for social justice and racial
equality written during apartheid is blocking a merger between the
South African church that supported the regime and its nonwhite
counterpart.
	   The church was to consider adopting the statement on Wednesday.
	   The mixed-race Uniting Reformed Church says it will only accept
its white sister as a partner if it approves the statement, called
the Confession of Belhar and named after the mixed-race township of
Belhar near Cape Town,
	   But four years after apartheid ended, the church that formed the
religious backbone of white minority rule was balking at the
proposal.
	   ``My hope and prayer is that it will go through,'' Delegate Piet
Meiring told the Associated Press. ``But I doubt it.''
	   Despite resistance to local unification, the church gathering on
Tuesday took a move to rejoin the global community of the reformed
church.
	   Nearly all of the 400 white delegates _ who meet every four
years _ approved a resolution denouncing white rule as ``sinful''
and calling the theological justification of apartheid ``a travesty
of the gospel and ... a theological heresy.''
	   By adopting the resolution, the Dutch Reformed Church
reactivated its membership in the 75-million strong World Alliance
of Reformed Churches.
	   WARC, which comprises reformed and Presbyterian churches,
suspended the Dutch Reformed Church in 1982 because it had violated
Bible teachings.
	   But Tuesday's renunciation of apartheid _ the latest and
strongest reversal _ did not satisfy the non-white Uniting Reformed
Church.
	   ``They were the ones who introduced the theological context into
the debate, by saying racial separation was the will of God,'' said
James Buys, URC moderator, in an interview.
	   He feels that white church members object to the merger because
of racism, not theological points.
	   White church delegates said they backed unification with their
sister church, but felt they were being forced to sanction a
theologically unacceptable document rooted in outdated
anti-apartheid history.
	   ``There is no racial tension,'' said Delegate Jacobus Gerber.
``This is not a black and white issue.''
	   The Confession was drawn up by black and mixed-race church
members in 1986 to distance themselves from the Dutch Reformed
Church and make a theological correction acceptable to the World
Alliance of Reformed Churches.
	   The integration of the two churches would mark a big step in
South Africa's racial reconciliation.
	   There were unconfirmed reports that the integration proposal has
angered provincial branches and that they are threatening to break
away from the church.
	   Last month, the 164,000-member Free State provincial branch was
reported to have opposed the merger because the branch objected to
worshiping with blacks and people of mixed race.
	   Starting in 1982, the 1.5 million-strong white church _ the main
religious denomination of Afrikaner descendants of Dutch settlers _
gradually renounced its hardline position but kept separate
branches for blacks, mixed-race and Indian congregants.
	   In 1994 _ when apartheid ended with the country's first all-race
elections _ the black and mixed-race branches merged to become the
1.5 million-strong Uniting Reformed Church.

Malaysian newspaper says Anwar Ibrahim may be moved to a jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian authorities plan to
release ex-Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim from detention under
the harsh Internal Security Act, a newspaper said Wednesday.
	   But he will still be held in a high security jail awaiting trial
on 10 counts of corruption and illegal sex, The Star daily said.
	   Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest under the Internal Security Act, which
allows indefinite detention without trial, has come in for sharp
criticism, both from domestic rights groups and international
organizations.
	   The police spokesman was not immediately available to comment on
the report and Anwar's defense lawyers said they had not heard
anything from officials.
	   ``As of now, the news is not true,'' said Kamar Ainiah, one of
Anwar's eight lawyers. ``None of the lawyers are aware of this. We
haven't been told anything.''
	   Anwar is currently being held in a cell at the Bukit Aman
federal police headquarters. Those detained under the ISA can be
secluded from family and lawyers and held in a secret place.
	   Once in a regular prison, Anwar, like other prisoners, would be
allowed visits from his lawyers and family members. But he would
not have any special privileges, according to unnamed sources
quoted by the newspaper.
	   Anwar, a former heir-apparent to Mahathir, was fired Sept. 2,
accused of being morally unfit to lead. The two men had differed
over economic policy, and Anwar has said Mahathir feared the deputy
was a threat to his office.
	   After his arrest, Anwar was brought to a court nine days later,
badly bruised and with a black eye. He said police had beaten him
until he fell unconscious on his first night of detention.
	   His lawyers have repeatedly complained that they were being
harassed by police and even interrogated about their role as
defense attorneys. Until last week, lawyers were denied access to
Anwar at police headquarters.
	   The High Court recently denied bail to Anwar, who faces trial
beginning Nov. 2 for charges of illegal homosexual acts and
corruption. He has pleaded innocent.

Hitchcock to start Game 6 for Padres
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Now it's Sterling Hitchcock's turn to pitch on
three days' rest.
	   With San Diego ace Kevin Brown throwing 41 pitches in a surprise
_ and losing _ relief appearance against Atlanta in the National
League championship series Monday night, the Padres will move up
the left-handed Hitchcock to start against the Atlanta Braves in
Game 6 on Wednesday.
	   The Padres, who will have slugger Greg Vaughn back on Wednesday,
didn't get any argument from Brown.
	   ``He's fine with this,'' manager Bruce Bochy said Tuesday
evening after the Padres' voluntary workout at Turner Field. ``He
was ready to go either way.''
	   With San Diego leading 4-2 and wanting to close out the Braves
at home, Bochy brought on Brown with a man on and none out in the
seventh inning Monday night. Brown retired the side, but wasn't
nearly as sharp in the eighth. With the Padres just five outs away
from the World Series, he allowed Michael Tucker's go-ahead,
three-run homer as the Braves staged an incredible rally to win
7-6.
	   San Diego leads the series 3-2. No team has rallied all the way
back from a 3-0 postseason deficit; the Braves are the first team
in that situation to force a sixth game.
	   Brown beat the Braves 3-0 with a three-hitter in Game 2, and
would start Game 7 Thursday night if the Padres lose to the Braves
and Tom Glavine Wednesday. The Braves' Game 7 starter would be Greg
Maddux, who also made a surprise relief appearance Monday and ended
up with his first career save.
	   Hitchcock beat Maddux and the Braves on Saturday at San Diego,
allowing one run on three hits in five innings. He also started the
go-ahead fifth-inning rally with a single off Maddux.
	   ``To me, probably on the outside things are a little bit more
crucial than they are in our clubhouse,'' pitching coach Dave
Stewart said. ``And in our clubhouse, one, we feel we have a good
shot tomorrow with Sterling, as we did starting Game 1 with Ash
(Andy Ashby), and two, if things don't happen in our favor
tomorrow, then we still got Brownie for the final game. Rested.
	   ``We'll go out, take our best shot tomorrow with Hitch and
whatever comes with that, we'll take it, and if we have to come
back for another ballgame, then we'll do that.''
	   Hitchcock wasn't available for comment Tuesday, but he came up
to Stewart in the dugout Monday night and told him he wanted the
ball for Game 6.
	   ``That was very helpful in making the decision easier to go with
him,'' Stewart said. ``But I think more than anything, Brownie's
been big for us this year. We've used him a lot, he's thrown a lot
of innings.''
	   After Brown struck out 16 in winning the division series opener
against Houston, he came back on three days' rest and wasn't as
effective, but he held the Astros to one earned run in 6 2-3
innings and the Padres got a strong effort from relievers Dan
Miceli and Trevor Hoffman to win.
	   Hitchcock, who was 9-7 with a 3.93 ERA in the regular season,
hasn't pitched on three days' rest this year. He's done it four
times in his career, going 0-2 with an 8.41 ERA. He threw 93
pitches on Saturday.
	   Including Saturday's game and a start here in May, Hitchcock has
allowed the Braves only seven hits and one earned run in 10 1-3
innings.
	   Vaughn, meanwhile, is scheduled to start in left field
Wednesday. He strained his left quadriceps when he slipped on the
wet grass in Game 1. He pinch-hit in the ninth Monday night,
striking out on three pitches from Maddux.

Cambodian athletes face money woes in preparing for Asian Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo PHN101 Upcoming
 &UR; BY KER MUNTHIT
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian boxer Hem Sokhet dreams of
winning gold as he trains for the upcoming Asian Games, but the
reality of hungry mouths to feed at home keeps him away from the
practice he so desperately needs.
	   Instead of working out with his trainers at Phnom Penh's
dilapidated Olympic Stadium _ a relic of the relatively prosperous
1960s _ the 23-year-old boxer often finds himself hefting sacks of
produce onto his muscled shoulders and loading them into trucks
bound for countryside markets.
	   Cambodia ranks as one of the poorest of the 43 nations expected
to compete in December at the 13th Asian Games in Bangkok. A
regional recession and continuing political instability after a
national election in July have compounded the Cambodian team's
financial difficulties.
	   Training facilities are woefully inadequate _ the boxing team
doesn't even have its own ring to practice in _ and athletes rarely
receive promised financial support.
	   ``I have not gotten any payment for the last six months. It is
supposed to be dlrs 90 a month,'' Hem Sokhet said, blaming his
team's money problems on Cambodia's bickering political factions.
	   Hem Sokhet has a wife and a young son to support. He and other
boxers often skip training sessions to raise money for their
families, their Cuban coach Lorenzo Moinelo Horejon lamented, and
their training lags behind the better-off competitors they will
face at Asia's version of the Olympics.
	   Cambodian promoters for the Asian Games have identified boxing
as among the nation's best hopes for medals.
	   ``Cambodia has good athletes, but where is the money?'' Horejon
said.
	   The coach wanted to send the team to the World Junior Boxing
Championships in Argentina next month to give his fighters a taste
of top international competition, but the Cambodian National
Olympic Committee is having enough problems raising cash for the
short trip to Bangkok.
	   Meas Sarin, secretary general of the Olympic Committee, said the
government has not responded to his proposal to send 36 athletes to
the games on a shoestring budget of dlrs 92,800.
	   The Cambodian football squad should bring the nation's athlete
total to 44. The more popular, and therefore better-funded sport,
has a separate budget from the rest of the team.
	   Meas Sarin said he doubts the cash-strapped government will
approve the entire budget. If cuts are made and he cannot find
commercial sponsors to make up the difference, the team will shrink
accordingly.
	   Money problems have already sunk the Cambodian basketball team's
hopes to compete in Bangkok. The fledgling squad did not even make
it onto the budget request.
	   Cambodian athletics, slowly rising from the ashes of two decades
of war and strife, received a boost in 1996 when five athletes were
sponsored by the International Olympic Committee to attend the
Summer Games in Atlanta.
	   At last year's Southeast Asian Games in Jakarta, Cambodian
athletes surprised their neighbors when they captured seven bronze
medals.
	   However, Meas Sarin said the level of competition at the Asian
Games may be too high to hold hopes that any Cambodians will reach
the podium.
	   ``If you want to win medals, you have to take time to prepare,''
he said. ``Good athletes begin their training at a young age _ at
about 10 years old _ but in Cambodia we have just started our
sports activities.''
	   While the sporting committee and trainers are skeptical about
the Cambodian team 's chances, Hem Sokhet refuses to count himself
out.
	   ``If you think you go there to lose, don't go,'' he said. ``In
the ring, I know that I must win for my nation.''

Federal judge refuses to intervene in stadium referendum issue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY NEUMEISTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A federal judge refused to get involved in the
debate over whether voters should decide if the city should spend
dlrs 1 billion to build a new stadium for the New York Yankees in
Manhattan.
	   After a hearing that ran late into the night, U.S. District
Judge Robert P. Patterson refused Tuesday to grant a preliminary
injunction that would have ordered the referendum be included on
30,000 absentee ballots.
	   Patterson's ruling came in a suit brought by the five Democratic
members of the 10-member Board of Election. The Democrats wanted
Patterson to stop the five Republicans on the board from refusing
to put the referendum on the absentee ballots.
	   Democrats want the stadium decision placed on the ballot because
it would generate strong voter interest in heavily Democratic New
York City.
	   The Republican members of the Board of Election have so far
refused to put it on the ballots, saying they will await the
outcome of appeals to a state judge's ruling that the referendum
should proceed.
	   Last week, Bronx state Supreme Court Justice Douglas McKeon
allowed the referendum to go forward. He compared building a new
stadium to a family buying a new home, saying ``each voice in the
family must be heard.'' The city's appeal of the ruling is still
pending.
	   Patterson listened to testimony for three hours before
concluding there was no reason to intervene in something that was
essentially a state court matter. He did not throw out the lawsuit
brought on behalf of two voters by the Democrats but said he
questioned whether it belonged in federal court.
	   He noted that the Democrats still have time to complete the
appeals process of the state judge's ruling in their favor before
the Nov. 3 election. He got acknowledgments from both sides that
they would let the court case proceed in an expedited fashion.
	   ``They haven't shown that ballots can't get out in reasonable
time,'' Patterson said. ``Under the circumstances, I don't think
there's been a showing of irreparable harm.''
	   Patterson scheduled a telephone conference among all the lawyers
for Wednesday to see if the city would agree to print up ballots
including the referendum in case the city loses its appeals.
	   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had tried to prevent the vote on the
referendum that asks voters whether they want to spend an estimated
dlrs 1 billion to build a new Yankee Stadium on Manhattan's West
Side.
	   Giuliani had proposed the stadium be built in an area now filled
with warehouses and rail yards after Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner indicated he might move the Yankees when the club's
lease expires in 2002.
	   Giuliani called the judge's ruling last week politically
motivated.

Holbrooke wraps up deal on Kosovo but threat remains

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _Rushing to meet a deadline set by
NATO, the government outlined its plan Tuesday to comply with a
deal to solve the Kosovo crisis while foreign powers started to put
2,000 monitors in place to prevent cheating.
	   Threatened by NATO airstrikes, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic agreed Monday to withdraw special forces from Kosovo,
begin peace talks with separatist ethnic Albanians and allow
international observers into the troubled Serb province.
	   But the deal is not finalized, and it wasn't clear when ethnic
Albanians who have fled Yugoslav security forces might return home.
	   NATO officials said they hadn't called off the airstrikes, and
that they could still bomb any time after Friday, the deadline for
Milosevic's compliance.
	   ``We hope that this will mark a turning point ... but the truth
is not in what I am saying here today. The truth is in
compliance,'' U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke said after week-long
talks with the president.
	   If honored, the commitments should end a seven-month crackdown
against Kosovo Albanian militants in the southern Serbian province
that killed hundreds _ most of them civilians _ and left up to
300,000 displaced.
	   In a rare televised address, the first since the 1995 Dayton
agreements that ended the Bosnian war, Milosevic sought to portray
the agreements as a victory, saying they ``avert the danger of a
military intervention against our country.''
	   ``The agreements ... are entirely in accordance with the
interests of our country,'' he added, citing ``enormous pressures
that we have been exposed to.''
	   Since the crackdown began Feb. 28, Milosevic has insisted the
crisis was an internal matter in which foreign powers should play
no role. The crackdown was aimed at the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army fighting to wrest Kosovo away from Serbia, the dominant
republic of Yugoslavia.
	   Holbrooke said the key to the accord was Milosevic's decision to
allow a 2,000-member ``verification mission'' and to permit aerial
verification by non-combat aircraft that could begin as soon as
this week.
	   ``They are not monitors, not observers,'' Holbrooke said. ``They
are compliance verifiers.''
	   Despite the rush to implement the Kosovo accord, officials
admitted Tuesday it could take weeks before 2,000 international
observers are in place to make sure Milosevic complies.
	   The Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which is responsible for the ground component, lacks a
large permanent staff. It will have to turn to its 54 member
states, including the United States, Russia, Canada and European
Union countries, to provide people.
	   In the Kosovo capital, Pristina, the political representative of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, Adem Demaci, said he was disappointed
that the verification forces in Kosovo would be unarmed. And in
Geneva, Switzerland, other KLA representatives said only
independence was acceptable.
	   Milosevic must take four steps: withdraw special troops from
Kosovo, sign an agreement on the verification mission, sign an
agreement on airborne reconnaissance over Kosovo and hammer out a
``framework agreement'' by November outlining future talks with
ethnic Albanians.
	   The Serbian government hurriedly outlined its plan Tuesday for a
political solution for the Kosovo crisis and announced local
elections in the province for 1999.
	   The ``principles for a political solution with a time frame for
their fulfillment'' envisage self-rule in Kosovo, establishment of
local police, elections within nine months, amnesty and an
international investigation of alleged war crimes and monitoring.
	   Political negotiations with the ethnic Albanians will continue
in Kosovo, led by Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to
Macedonia.
	   The ethnic Albanians, who form 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million
population, have insisted on independence rather than regaining the
autonomy Milosevic stripped in 1989.
	   International leaders stepped up efforts to resolve the crisis
because of fears that thousands of refugees would die if they could
not return home by winter.
	   For some Kosovo refugees it is too late.
	   Besart Buqa died Tuesday in Kosovo. He was five weeks old, all
of them spent as a refugee living under plastic sheets and
makeshift tents.
	   His mother and father say they were too afraid of Serb forces to
return home in Budakovo, 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of
Pristina.
	   The boy died of the cold and exposure, his parents said.

Cambodian athletes face money woes in preparing for Asian Games

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian boxer Hem Sokhet dreams of
winning gold as he trains for the upcoming Asian Games, but the
reality of hungry mouths to feed at home keeps him away from the
practice he so desperately needs.
	   Instead of working out with his trainers at Phnom Penh's
dilapidated Olympic Stadium _ a relic of the relatively prosperous
1960s _ the 23-year-old boxer often finds himself hefting sacks of
produce onto his muscled shoulders and loading them into trucks
bound for countryside markets.
	   Cambodia ranks as one of the poorest of the 43 nations expected
to compete in December at the 13th Asian Games in Bangkok. A
regional recession and continuing political instability after a
national election in July have compounded the Cambodian team's
financial difficulties.
	   Training facilities are woefully inadequate _ the boxing team
doesn't even have its own ring to practice in _ and athletes rarely
receive promised financial support.
	   ``I have not gotten any payment for the last six months. It is
supposed to be dlrs 90 a month,'' Hem Sokhet said, blaming his
team's money problems on Cambodia's bickering political factions.
	   Hem Sokhet has a wife and a young son to support. He and other
boxers often skip training sessions to raise money for their
families, their Cuban coach Lorenzo Moinelo Horejon lamented, and
their training lags behind the better-off competitors they will
face at Asia's version of the Olympics.
	   Cambodian promoters for the Asian Games have identified boxing
as among the nation's best hopes for medals.
	   ``Cambodia has good athletes, but where is the money?'' Horejon
said.
	   The coach wanted to send the team to the World Junior Boxing
Championships in Argentina next month to give his fighters a taste
of top international competition, but the Cambodian National
Olympic Committee is having enough problems raising cash for the
short trip to Bangkok.
	   Meas Sarin, secretary general of the Olympic Committee, said the
government has not responded to his proposal to send 36 athletes to
the games on a shoestring budget of dlrs 92,800.
	   The Cambodian football squad should bring the nation's athlete
total to 44. The more popular, and therefore better-funded sport,
has a separate budget from the rest of the team.
	   Meas Sarin said he doubts the cash-strapped government will
approve the entire budget. If cuts are made and he cannot find
commercial sponsors to make up the difference, the team will shrink
accordingly.
	   Money problems have already sunk the Cambodian basketball team's
hopes to compete in Bangkok. The fledgling squad did not even make
it onto the budget request.
	   Cambodian athletics, slowly rising from the ashes of two decades
of war and strife, received a boost in 1996 when five athletes were
sponsored by the International Olympic Committee to attend the
Summer Games in Atlanta.
	   At last year's Southeast Asian Games in Jakarta, Cambodian
athletes surprised their neighbors when they captured seven bronze
medals.
	   However, Meas Sarin said the level of competition at the Asian
Games may be too high to hold hopes that any Cambodians will reach
the podium.
	   ``If you want to win medals, you have to take time to prepare,''
he said. ``Good athletes begin their training at a young age _ at
about 10 years old _ but in Cambodia we have just started our
sports activities.''
	   While the sporting committee and trainers are skeptical about
the Cambodian team 's chances, Hem Sokhet refuses to count himself
out.
	   ``If you think you go there to lose, don't go,'' he said. ``In
the ring, I know that I must win for my nation.''

NBA cancels first two weeks of season after talks break off
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL;

 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The streak is over, a perfect record is history
- 35,001 basketball games over 51 seasons.
	   The National Basketball Association wiped out the first two
weeks of the 1998-1999 season Tuesday, canceling regular-season
games because of a work stoppage for the first time in its history.
	   The action was taken when collective bargaining talks between
owners and players broke off after about 3 1/2 hours.
	   Asked to describe his feelings, commissioner David Stern's first
two words were: ``Lousy, disappointed.''
	   ``My job is to put on games for the fans, not to cancel them.
It's terribly disappointing,'' he said.
	   A total of 99 games from Nov. 3 through Nov. 16 will not be
played or made up, and the vast majority of players will miss their
first paychecks Nov. 15.
	   The union put forth an 11th-hour proposal _ a luxury tax on
players re-signing under the so-called Larry Bird exception _ to
address the owners' concerns over escalating salaries. But it
wasn't enough to save the full 82-game season.
	   ``It's evident we're not going to reach an agreement any time
soon, so we are reluctantly canceling the first two weeks,'' a
dour-faced deputy commissioner Russ Granik said from a podium at a
midtown Manhattan hotel.
	   Sitting beside him was Stern, who looked equally glum.
	   The NBA had been the only major American professional sports
league to never have lost a game to a labor dispute.
	   Baseball's disastrous strike of 1994-95 wiped out the World
Series, the NHL suffered through a 2 1/2-month lockout that ended
in January 1995, and an NFL strike in 1987 lasted about a month.
	   Two previous NBA lockouts in 1995 and 1996 ended before any
games were missed.
	   The next move in this dispute will come from the owners, who
will deliver a counterproposal later this week. Tuesday was the
105th day of the lockout.
	   ``It doesn't look promising,'' Stern said. ``The reality is that
the owners had no choice. The union indicated some flexibility, but
the reality is that their proposal doesn't completely address what
we've focused on.''
	   The sides met for two sessions, one in the morning when the
union made its proposal and one in the afternoon after the owners
discussed it.
	   ``We players feel we're taking steps to bridge the gap,'' union
president Patrick Ewing said. ``Now the ball is in their court to
take steps to get closer to us.''
	   The union's luxury tax proposal would require owners to pay a
tax on certain exorbitant contracts such as the dlrs 126 million,
six-year extension signed by Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota
Timberwolves last year when he was just 20.
	   The exact threshold numbers and percentages were not disclosed,
but union lawyers said the Garnett contract would have triggered
the tax.
	   Money collected from the luxury tax would be redistributed to
low-revenue teams, much like the system baseball owners have
adopted.
	   ``I think we definitely surprised them,'' union director Billy
Hunter said. ``Our intention was to put something bold on the
table.
	   ``The message here is that we're trying. What kind of response
they make will determine what kind of progress we can make and
whether we can salvage the rest of the November schedule _ or the
rest of the season,'' Hunter said.
	   Stern said the idea of a tax was something the owners would look
at, but by itself it was not enough to stop the league from
canceling games.
	   The owners imposed the lockout July 1, and the summer and early
fall passed with the sides meeting only twice for formal bargaining
sessions. The talks Tuesday were the third between the sides.
	   Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo, Ray Allen, Antonio Davis and John Starks
were among the players who attended the meeting. The owners were
represented by Gordon Gund (Cleveland), Les Alexander (Houston),
Abe Pollin (Washington) David Checketts (New York) and Jerry
Colangelo (Phoenix). Both sides are still awaiting a decision from
arbitrator John Feerick, dean of Fordham Law School, who will rule
by Sunday whether more than 200 players with guaranteed contracts
must be paid during the lockout.
	   In the last labor agreement in 1995, the owners agreed to pay
the players between 48 percent and 51.8 percent of revenues. If the
percentage went higher _ and owners claim it reached 57 percent
last season _ the owners had the right to toss out the old deal and
seek a new one, which they did.
	   They have demanded ``cost certainty'' from the players, meaning
they want to put an absolute ceiling on the amount of money that
can be devoted to payrolls. The union calls such a system a
``hard'' salary cap and has refused to accept one.
	   The union had previously proposed a concession slowing the
growth of the salary cap from year to year if the amount of money
devoted to player salaries exceeded 63 percent of revenues.

Palmeiras beats Universidad do Chile 1-0 in Copa Mercosur
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Already classified for the next round
of play, Palmeiras didn't need their 1-0 win over Universidad do
Chile in the Mercosur Cup Tuesday night. But they took it anyway.
	   The first half saw Oseas expelled leaving Palmeiras with only 10
men and the two teams play to a tie.
	   But Palmeiras was still a teamed to be reckoned with and they
showed this early in the second half, when Arce crossed to Almir
who blasted it just right of Universidad goalie Roberto Rojas in
the 56th minute.
	   With the win Palmeiras ends the first round winning all five of
its games for perfect 18 points. Universidad leaves the tournament
at the bottom of Group B with only three points.
	   Lineups:
	   Palmeiras: Marco, Arce, Agnaldo, Cleber, Junior (Ferugem),
Tiago, Pedrinho, Zinho, Arilson, Magrao and Oseas.
	   Universidad do Chile: Roberto Rojas, Castaneda, Mora, Ricardo
Rojas, Olarra, Valencia, Galdamez (Arancbia), Aros, Leo Rodriguez,
Guzman (Pedro Gonzales) and Barrera.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The first secretary of the Saudi
Arabian Embassy in Australia has been found dead in a pool of blood
in his apartment in the capital, police and diplomatic sources said
Wednesday.
	   Australian Federal Police spokesman Eric Meyer said the man's
body was found in an apartment in the inner-Canberra suburb of
Kingston, close to Parliament House, late on Tuesday.
	   The Saudi embassy said the man was Abdullah Al Ghamdi, 54, who
had failed to appear at work Tuesday.
	   A colleague went to his apartment and found Al Ghamdi lying on
the floor of the kitchen in a pool of blood, the embassy said in a
statement.
	   ``At this stage our city crime team is investigating,'' Meyer
said.
	   ``It is still classed as suspicious because we have not
established the circumstances leading up to the death.
	   ``Police conducted a search last night and will continue
today,'' he said.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Omar Vizquel's record-tying errorless streak
ended Tuesday night when he made a wild throw on Scott Brosius'
grounder in the sixth inning of Game 6 of the AL championship
series against the Yankees.
	   The Cleveland Indians' shortstop had gone 17 consecutive AL
championship series games without an error, tying the record set by
Baltimore's Mark Belanger, who died last week.
	   It was Vizquel's first error in 47 postseason games and 238
postseason chances.

Coates calls for action on drug importation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian Olympic Committee president
John Coates has repeated his call for governments to introduce
tougher laws to prevent athletes from importing sports drugs.
	   The latest warning follows news that Australian Customs officers
caught two athletes trying to import EPO and DHEA _ substances
banned in sport. Customs officials would not tell the AOC the names
of the athletes because the two substances are not banned by the
Australian government.
	   ``There have been instances now of an international athlete and
some Australian athletes found with those drugs at the airport,
nothing could happen because of our customs regulations,'' Coates
said Wednesday.
	   ``Trafficking in this country is out of hand and we need
governments to have stronger laws and in this case Customs as well
to have a stronger commitment to put the resources there to
seriously attack this problem.''
	   Coates released a document in August which urged governments to
put penalties for sports drugs on a par with narcotics.
	   The International Olympic Committee announced in September that
it supported moves to jail athletes caught trafficking or dealing
in sports drugs.
	   A spokesman for Australian Customs Minister Warren Truss said
the service could not supply information on the athletes to the AOC
because of privacy rules.

North Korean soldiers defect to South Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Two North Korean soldiers walked
across a mine-infested border and defected to South Korea on
Wednesday, the Defense Ministry said.
	   Capt. Seok Myong Hwan, 32, a doctor, and female Sgt. 1st Class
Song Myong Soon, 23, were spotted by border guards early in the day
near Churwon on the central Korean border, it said.
	   The South Korean soldiers guided the couple through the mine
field, the ministry said.
	   Song, a telephone operator, was the first female soldier to
defect to the South since 1974. This year, four soldiers have
walked across the border into the South.
	   Other details were not immediately available.
	   The number of North Koreans fleeing their hunger-stricken
homeland has increased considerably in recent years. So far this
year, 51 North Koreans have defected to South Korea, mostly through
China.
	   In the past two years, a dozen North Korean soldiers have
defected across the 260-kilometer (155-mile)-long Korean border,
the world's most heavily armed.
	   On Tuesday, a man claiming to be a retired North Korean army
lieutenant colonel arrived in Seoul from an unidentified third
country and sought asylum.
	   The Koreas are still technically at war with no peace treaty
signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.

Noted Japanese dancer Fujima dies of cancer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Fujiko Fujima, a noted Japanese-style dancer and
dance choreographer for the traditional kabuki theater, died of
stomach cancer at a Tokyo hospital Wednesday, a relative said. She
was 90.
	   Fujima, whose real name was Kimiyo Tanaka, had been treated for
cancer since early last month at the Nihon University hospital in
Tokyo's Chiyoda ward.
	   A native of Tokyo, she became an accredited dance master in 1926
after being adopted into the Fujima family, famous for performing
traditional Japanese-style dancing.
	   Fujima was highly regarded for her refined yet orthodox
choreography of classical dance pieces and new kabuki dances.
	   In 1985, she was designated by the Japanese government as a
living national treasure, becoming the first woman in the field of
kabuki dance to be so honored.
	   A funeral service was scheduled for Oct. 27 at Tokyo's Tsukiji
Honganji Temple.

NBA cancels first two weeks of season after talks break off

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The NBA's perfect record _ 35,001 games over 51
seasons, never once interrupted by a strike or lockout _ is
history.
	   The league wiped out the first two weeks of the 1998-1999 season
Tuesday, canceling regular-season games because of a work stoppage
for the first time ever.
	   The action was taken when collective bargaining talks between
owners and players broke off after about 3 1/2 hours,
	   ``My job is to put on games for the fans, not to cancel them.
It's terribly disappointing,'' commissioner David Stern said.
	   A total of 99 games from Nov. 3 through Nov. 16 will not be
played or made up, and the majority of players will miss their
first paychecks Nov. 15.
	   The union put forth an 11th-hour proposal _ a luxury tax on
players re-signing under the so-called Larry Bird exception _ to
address the owners' concerns over escalating salaries. But it
wasn't enough to save the full 82-game season.
	   ``It's evident we're not going to reach an agreement any time
soon, so we are reluctantly canceling the first two weeks,'' a
dour-faced deputy commissioner Russ Granik said from a podium at a
midtown Manhattan hotel.
	   Sitting beside him was Stern, who looked equally glum.
	   The NBA had been the only major American professional sports
league that never lost a game to a labor dispute.
	   Baseball's disastrous strike of 1994-95 wiped out the World
Series, the NHL suffered through a 2 1/2-month lockout that ended
in January 1995, and an NFL strike in 1987 lasted about a month.
	   Two previous NBA lockouts in 1995 and 1996 ended before any
games were missed.
	   The next move in this dispute will come from the owners, who
will deliver a counterproposal later this week. Tuesday was the
105th day of the lockout.
	   ``It doesn't look promising,'' Stern said. ``The reality is that
the owners had no choice. The union indicated some flexibility, but
the reality is that their proposal doesn't completely address what
we've focused on.''
	   The sides met for two sessions, one in the morning when the
union made its proposal and one in the afternoon after the owners
discussed it.
	   ``We players feel we're taking steps to bridge the gap,'' union
president Patrick Ewing said. ``Now the ball is in their court to
take steps to get closer to us.''
	   The union's luxury tax proposal would require owners to pay a
tax on certain exorbitant contracts such as the dlrs 126 million,
six-year extension signed by Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota
Timberwolves last year when he was just 20.
	   A source close to the talks, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the tax would kick in on any contract worth more than dlrs 18
million, with a rate of 50 percent for the amount over that
threshold. If Michael Jordan signed another dlrs 33 million
contract, the tax on Chicago owner Jerry Reinsdorf would be dlrs
7.5 million (50 percent of the dlrs 15 million overage).
	   Money collected from the luxury tax would be redistributed to
low-revenue teams, much like the system baseball owners have
adopted.
	   ``I think we definitely surprised them,'' union director Billy
Hunter said. ``Our intention was to put something bold on the
table.
	   ``The message here is that we're trying. What kind of response
they make will determine what kind of progress we can make and
whether we can salvage the rest of the November schedule _ or the
rest of the season,'' Hunter said.
	   Stern said the idea of a tax was something the owners would look
at, but by itself it was not enough to stop the league from
canceling games.
	   ``We had a somewhat more constructive dialogue, but it's hard to
say if we got closer to an agreement,'' Granik said. ``We promised
to come back with our own set of proposals.''
	   The owners imposed the lockout July 1, and the summer and early
fall passed with the sides meeting only twice for formal bargaining
sessions. The talks Tuesday were the third between the sides.
	   In addition to Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo, Ray Allen, Antonio Davis
and John Starks were among the players attending the meeting.
Owners were represented by Gordon Gund (Cleveland), Les Alexander
(Houston), Abe Pollin (Washington) David Checketts (New York) and
Jerry Colangelo (Phoenix). Both sides are still awaiting a decision
from arbitrator John Feerick, dean of Fordham Law School, who will
rule by Sunday whether more than 200 players with guaranteed
contracts must be paid during the lockout.
	   In the last labor agreement in 1995, the owners agreed to pay
the players between 48 percent and 51.8 percent of revenues. If the
percentage went higher _ and owners claim it reached 57 percent
last season _ the owners had the right to toss out the old deal and
seek a new one, which they did.
	   They have demanded ``cost certainty'' from the players, meaning
they want to put an absolute ceiling on the amount of money that
can be devoted to payrolls. The union calls such a system a
``hard'' salary cap and has refused to accept one.
	   The union had previously proposed a concession slowing the
growth of the salary cap from year to year if the amount of money
devoted to player salaries exceeded 63 percent of revenues.
	   When they made another offer in August, they replaced that ``cap
credit'' with a change in the maximum raise rule, offering to
decrease the year-to-year increases in player contracts from a
maximum of 20 percent to 10 percent.
	   Their new offer contains both concessions, as well as an
agreement to add marijuana to the banned substances list and give
teams the right of first refusal for players finishing their
three-year rookie contracts.

`Super Typhoon' Zeb slams into northern Philippine province
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ `Super typhoon' Zeb slammed into the
northern Philippines on Wednesday, dumping rain and toppling
electrical posts and trees. There were no immediate reports of
casualties.
	   Packing peak sustained winds of 240 kilometers (150 miles) per
hour with gusts of up to 295 kph (184 mph), Zeb hit land at 9 a.m.
(0100 GMT) near Palanan town in Isabela province, said chief
weather forecaster Frisco Nilo.
	   Nilo said Zeb, the strongest of eight storms to visit the
country this year, is expected to weaken when it hits mountain
ranges in Isabela and nearby Cagayan province as it moves northwest
at 22 kph (14 mph).
	   Local electrical distributors in the area cut power early this
morning to prevent electrical accidents as heavy rains flood many
areas. Flash floods have reportedly isolated many remote towns.
	   On Tuesday, disaster relief officials were sent to areas in the
north to urge residents of coastal and flood-prone areas to
evacuate ahead of the typhoon. Government offices and schools have
been readied to accept evacuees.
	   Five northern provinces, including Isabela, Cagayan, Quirino,
Aurora and the Batanes island group have been placed on maximum
storm alert, said forecaster Susan Dampog.
	   A storm gains ``super typhoon'' status if its maximum sustained
winds reach 220 kph (138 mph).
	   Last month, tropical storm Vicki struck the northern
Philippines, causing at least 52 deaths on land. A ferry also sank
during south of Manila, leaving 70 passengers dead and 80 others
missing.

Report: Malaysia holds back Viagra sale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Health authorities say impotence
drug Viagra has passed tests needed for it to be sold in Malaysia
but is being held back because of deaths among its users, a
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   The government had decided to be cautious about releasing Viagra
in the domestic market ``to ensure the safety of the Malaysian
public,'' Health Minister Chua Jui Meng was quoted as saying in the
New Straits Times.
	   The U.S. federal Food and Drug Administration, which approved
the drug in March, reported in August that 69 people who were
taking Viagra had died as of July 31. There is no certainty that
any of them died of Viagra, and the FDA said that the deaths were
not necessarily linked to the drug.
	   The Malaysian government has asked the manufacturer, Pfizer, to
provide more information about the drug and educate the prescribing
doctors on its proper usage. The drug would be sold only by
prescription.

Seized heroin shipment Australia's largest, police say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ In Australia's largest-ever seizure of
heroin, agents Wednesday swept down on traffickers off the east
coast, confiscated 900 pounds (400 kilograms) of the drug and
arrested 18 people, authorities said.
	   The pre-dawn raid by Australian state and national police and
customs officials culminated a 10-week international police
operation, breaking up a major trafficking ring, officials said.
	   Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone said more arrests may follow in
Australia and in Hong Kong.
	   On initial examination, the haul was up to 900 pounds (400
kilograms) of high-grade heroin worth up to Australian dollars 400
million (U.S. dlrs 250 million), Federal Police chief Mick Palmer
said.
	   ``It is three times the complete seizures (in Australia) last
year, it is the largest seizure in Australia's history and it is up
there with some of the biggest seizures in other parts of the
world,'' he said.
	   Armed police swooped down on the shipment early Wednesday as it
was brought ashore at a deserted beach near Port Macquarie, on New
South Wales state's mid-north coast.
	   Minutes later, police raided a 130-ft. (40 meters) ship moored
25 nautical miles offshore which had unloaded the shipment, and
arrested the captain and members of the crew.
	   Television footage showed police aboard the freighter guarding
crew members, who were lying face down on the deck, their hands
handcuffed behind their backs.
	   Palmer said the heroin was believed to have come from Southeast
Asia's ``Golden Triangle'' _ the region where the borders of
Thailand, Myanmar and Laos converge. The ship had sailed from
Southeast Asia, but police did not disclosed the owner or other
details of the ship.
	   The action followed surveillance of a Hong Kong man who aroused
Australian police suspicions during an earlier visit to Sydney.
Australian authorities collaborated with Hong Kong police in
uncovering the massive importation scheme.
	   The previous largest haul of heroin in Australia was more than
265 pounds (120 kilograms) recovered from Darwin Harbor after being
thrown overboard from a Thai fishing boat in 1994.
	   Vanstone said Wednesday's amount was enough for eight million
``hits'' of heroin, or one for every household in Australia.

Yankees 9, Indians 5
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Revenge complete. The American League pennant is
back in the Bronx.
	   Yankee Stadium rocked long and hard Tuesday night, as New York
reached the World Series for a record 35th time by beating the
Cleveland Indians 9-5 to win the AL championship series in six
games.
	   It was a little strange, and a little sloppy.
	   Scott Brosius seemed to finish Cleveland off with a three-run
homer for a 6-0 lead in the third inning. But David Cone nearly
gave it all back, allowing a grand slam to Jim Thome that pulled
the Indians within a run.
	   Derek Jeter then restored the safety margin with a two-run
triple in the sixth, a drive to right that Manny Ramirez tried to
snag with a leap at the top of the wall _ only the ball landed on a
hop at his feet.
	   New York, which opens the World Series at home Saturday night
against Atlanta or San Diego, won an AL title at home for the first
time since the Reggie Jackson-Thurman Munson-Ron Guidry team in
1978.
	   Cleveland, which beat the Yankees in the first round last year
and came within two outs of winning its first World Series since
1948, failed to force a seventh game because it allowed five
unearned runs.
	   Other game highlights: another controversial umpiring call, a
line drive that hit an umpire on the backside and a pumped-up crowd
that took every opportunity to make up for the taunts David Wells
endured in Cleveland last week.
	   After going 114-48 during the regular season and sweeping Texas
in the first round, the Yankees felt pressure to reach the Series,
which they won in 1996.
	   Cleveland felt pressure, too, after losing Game 7 of the World
Series to Florida last October. But after falling behind two games
to one, New York turned it around at Jacobs Field behind strong
pitching from Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez in Game 4 and by Wells
in Game 5.
	   By the eighth inning, fans were taunting the Indians with chants
of ``1948.'' Responding to a remark by Cleveland's David Justice
that the only way Yankees fans could get tougher would be if they
brought Uzis to the ballpark, one fan hung pictures of a machine
gun from the upper deck for each strikeout by Cone, who fanned
eight.
	   Umpires again were in the center of controversy. Ted Hendry, the
second-base umpire, appeared to blow a call in the third inning,
ruling New York's Chili Davis safe on a force play, claiming Omar
Vizquel was pulled off the base by the throw. Two outs later,
Brosius' homer made it 6-0.
	   Brosius' homer came after Williams' leadoff single and the
controversial call by Hendry. Davis grounded to second and Enrique
Wilson's throw to second for the force was wide to the shortstop
side. While Vizquel appeared to keep a foot on the bag, Hendry
called Davis safe.
	   Cleveland starter Charles Nagy, who took the loss, quickly got
in trouble, and Cleveland fell behind on consecutive one-out
singles in the first by Jeter, Paul O'Neill and Williams. Davis
followed with a sacrifice fly.
	   New York made it 3-0 in the second on an error by left fielder
Brian Giles. Joe Girardi singled with one out, Chuck Knoblauch
doubled into the left-field corner and Giles, after picking up the
ball, let it fall out of his glove.
	   Cone took a shutout into the fifth. After singles by Wilson and
Kenny Lofton put runners on first and third, Vizquel hit a liner up
the middle that hit Hendry in the rear end. Lofton remained on
third instead of scoring and a walk to Justice forced in a run.
After fanning Ramirez, Cone gave up the grand slam to Thome, who
set an AL championship series record with his fourth homer.
	   Ramiro Mendoza came in to start the sixth and allowed a hit in
three shutout innings. Mariano Rivera finished up.

Seoul seeks revision in contract for U.S. military spy planes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The Defense Ministry said Wednesday it
has asked the U.S. Air Force to help it rewrite a contract for
purchase of American-made military spy planes.
	   The ministry signed the dlrs 461 million contract in 1996 to buy
eight Hawker-800XPs, manufactured by subsidiaries of Raytheon Co.
in Lexington, Massachusetts.
	   ``We have found some problems and demanded negotiations with the
U.S. side to resolve these problems. We hope we will not have to
reconsider the whole project because of this,'' said a ministry
spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The spokesman declined to divulge details. But local news media
reported that South Korea, among other things, wants to conduct
test flights before agreeing to accept the the planes.
	   The project came under media scrutiny after four military
officers and two arms brokers were arrested early this month on
charges of leaking classified project data to a U.S.-based arms
dealing agency called IMCL.
	   Ministry officials believe that IMCL worked for E-Systems Inc.,
a Texas-based Raytheon subsidiary, which builds equipment that
enables the spy planes to pick up sensitive electronic signals.
	   Also Wednesday, South Korean news media reported that a retired
general has been arrested on charges of accepting bribes from the
arrested arms dealers.
	   The ministry refused to confirm the reports, which also said
military prosecutors were expanding their probe to other top
officers.
	   South Korea planned to deploy the spy planes beginning in 2000
as part of its efforts to beef up its own intelligence gathering
ability against communist North Korea. South Korea now depends
almost entirely on the United States for electronic and satellite
intelligence on rival North Korea.
	   South Korea, still technically at war with North Korea, is a
major buyer of U.S. arms. It plans to spend dlrs 33.6 billion on
new weapons through 2004.
