	   NOOSA, Australia (AP) _ New Zealand's Hamish Carter sealed the
World Cup triathlon series Sunday when he placed second in the 10th
and final leg.
	   Venezuela's Gilberto Gonzalez won the men's race but Carter did
enough to finish first in the overall standings ahead of Dimitry
Gaag of Kazakstan.
	   Australian Michellie Jones had already secured the women's world
title. Jones crashed out on the first lap of the bike leg Sunday as
fellow Australian Loretta Harrop won the event.

Laughing contest gives competitors, crowd hysterics

<TEXT>
	   PATTAYA, Thailand (AP) _ Some bent over backwards. Others jumped
up and down. And a few stomped their feet, struggling _ painfully
at times _ to keep themselves laughing as long and funnily as they
could.
	   Specators wondered whether permanent physical damage would
result Saturday to some of the contestants at Thailand's first
laughing contest, sponsored by the U.S.-based Ripley's Believe It
or Not.
	   ``I've been to a number of fairs and contests around the world,
and this was definitely one of the weirdest,'' said Jerry Reed, 66,
of Santa Cruz, California, the only foreigner among the 15
finalists from an original 64 entrants.
	   Reed likened the laughing contest to chicken-clucking and
hog-calling events he had taken part in in Texas. His ho-ho-ho was
something like an operatic baritone.
	   Competitors were judged on the originality and oddity of their
laughs and got big points _ in the form of giggles and guffaws _
for endurance from the hundreds of spectators.
	   Kawachart Thongchure, a 54-year-old housewife and mother of
four, walked away with the winner's prize of 10,000 baht (dlrs 280)
and a certificate from Ripley's acknowledging her achievement.
	   Kawachart laughed for nine minutes _ the maximum allowed _ and
continued to do so even as she was escorted off the stage. She
promised to donate part of the winnings to a Buddhist temple.
	   ``It pleases me to be able to make people laugh, especially at a
time when so many of us are facing economic hardship,'' Kawachart
told reporters, referring to Thailand's worst recession in decades.
	   Kawachart said that she didn't think about anything particularly
funny _ mostly about herself and how silly she probably looked on
stage. Her high-pitched, horse-like whinny sounded unmistakably
genuine and had the crowd in stitches.
	   Ripley's opened a museum in this popular seaside resort in 1996.
Besides giving Kawachart a cash prize, she will also feature in the
Ripley's cartoon strip syndicated to newspapers in 42 countries.
	   The event was partly aimed at changing Pattaya's image from a
polluted red-light district fronting the Gulf of Thailand to a more
family oriented destination.
	   Ripley's plans to hold the contest annually.

Makinen scores controversial win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Two-time world champion Tommi Makinen
scored a controversial victory in Rally Australia Sunday to lead
the standings with one round left of the world championship.
	   The Finn successfully appealed against a 1-minute penalty
imposed for jumping the start in the final stage Saturday night.
The decision moved Makinen from sixth to second, 23 seconds behind
Spain's Carlos Sainz, who was leading the standings before this
12th of 13 rounds.
	   Makinen finished 16.5 seconds ahead of a furious Sainz to take a
two-point advantage into the final event in England in two weeks.
	   ``It's a scandal,'' Sainz said. ``It's quite clear what happened
last night _ 20,000 people and the television cameras all saw it
but there's no penalty applied.''
	   Makinen said he did not believe he jumped the start in the
2.2-kilometer (1.36-mile) 19th leg on Saturday night.
	   Buoyed by his successful protest, Makinen went into the final
stage leading by 17 seconds.
	   Makinen's victory also ended the title hopes of Scotland's Colin
McRae, who was fourth in his Subaru.
	   France's Didier Auriol was third in his Toyota and Juha
Kankkunen was fifth in his Ford.
	   England's Richard Burns, who was in great form early in the
event, was forced to retire after rolling his Mitsubishi on the
penultimate stage when poised for a top four finish.

Portuguese enclave suggested as Nobel Peace candidate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Despite its frequent gangland-style violence,
the Portuguese enclave of Macau deserves a Nobel Peace Prize for
its role as a peaceful link between Europe and Asia for more than
four centuries, a renowned Portuguese historian reportedly said.
	   Professor Jose Hermano Saraiva told Radio Macau that he would
try to get support among Portuguese academics to send the proposal
to the Nobel Peace Prize Committee in Oslo, the Sunday Hong Kong
Standard reported Sunday.
	   Macau, a small territory of about 450,000 people south of
mainland China, deserves the award for its peaceful existence as a
cultural bridge between the East and the West, the paper quoted
Saraiva as saying.
	   Macau, set to return to Chinese rule in Dec. 20, 1999, has been
ruled by the Portuguese since 1557, when Chinese officials
permitted Portuguese seafarers to settle in the peninsula.
	   Unlike neighboring Hong Kong, which ended 150 years of British
rule in July, 1997, Macau was not conquered by war but peacefully
settled.
	   China and Portugul have had an amicable relationship, despite a
handful of bloody incidents in the past 441 years
	   Macau has been rocked by a wave of gang-related violence,
apparently over dwindling profits from its lucrative gambling
business.

Hun Sen endorses king's offer of opposition security to resume
</HEADLINE>
talks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Strongman Hun Sen has lent his
support to King Norodom Sihanouk's offer to ensure the protection
of opposition leaders if they return to Cambodia to resume stalled
negotiations over forming a new government.
	   King Sihanouk, 76, said Saturday that the opposition leaders _
his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and former finance minister Sam
Rainsy _ could stay under his protection at the Royal Palace
provided they return to Cambodia within one week.
	   The king plans to go to China for medical treatment no later
than Nov. 14, but said he is ready to host a summit between the
opposition and Hun Sen by then to break a deadlock that has
paralyzed Cambodia since disputed parliamentary elections in July.
	   The opposition leaders and many of their supporters fled abroad
shortly after the new National Assembly was sworn in Sept. 24,
saying they feared violence from Hun Sen's supporters. They dismiss
his promises that they are safe to return.
	   In a letter released late Saturday, Hun Sen said he ``fully''
supports the king's suggestion. ``Your Majesty's humble gesture and
idea will make the return quickly possible, giving a golden
opportunity for progress for our nation.''
	   There was no immediate response from Ranariddh or Sam Rainsy.
	   Hun Sen's formerly communist Cambodian People's Party narrowly
won the July elections, but failed to secure the two-thirds
majority needed to approve a new government. The opposition claims
he won by fraud and intimidation and have refused to give him the
support he needs.
	   That leaves Cambodia under the de facto rule of Hun Sen and the
government he installed after launching a bloody coup in 1997 to
end his tense four-year co-premiership with Ranariddh.
	   Hun Sen has dubbed his political opponents as cowards for
refusing to accept defeat and accused them of using security
concerns as a pretext to prolong the current political stalemate.
	   They have stayed abroad since the assembly inauguration Sept.
24, which was overshadowed by a rocket attack. Hun Sen and his
security chiefs accused the opposition of trying to kill him.
	   Sihanouk stepped up the pressure on Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy to
decide to return home by setting the Nov. 14 deadline. The king is
the only political figure in Cambodia who could bring all the
bickering rivals around a table.
	   Sihanouk said that his doctors have urged him to go to Beijing
for ``urgent'' checkups and treatment. The monarch has suffered
from cancers, arteriosclerosis and cataracts.
	   If no summit can be arranged before his departure, the king said
he was willing to try to organize one at his Beijing residence.

Morgan Stanley chief sees interest in Thai, Korean bonds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The managing director of Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter Asia believes U.S. investors are eager to buy Thai and
South Korean corporate bonds amid the perception both countries are
taking the right economic medicine.
	   Ronald Ong told Dow Jones Newswires on the sidelines of a forum
of corporate chief financial officers in Bangkok that the outlook
was now good for companies in both countries to raise much-needed
capital from global corporate bond issues.
	   ``Investors in bonds in the U.S. are showing a desire for Thai
and South Korean bonds,'' Ong said Saturday.
	   Compared to other crisis-hit economies in the world, South Korea
and Thailand seem a couple of steps ahead in their bid to implement
economic reforms, Ong said.
	   ``Investors believe that Thailand and South Korea are well ahead
of other countries in working out the situation,'' Ong said.
	   Authorities in both countries have forced closures and mergers
of weak banks and drawn up plans to help recapitalize their
debt-ridden financial systems.
	   Ong said Thailand's bankruptcy law, designed to encourage the
restructuring of debt rather than liquidation of failed companies,
was an example of the kind of structural change which improved
foreign investor sentiment.
	   Thai corporate bonds are currently trading in the secondary
market at around 7 percent above comparable U.S. Treasury bonds,
down from an 8 percent to 15 percent spread earlier this year, Ong
said.
	   Morgan Stanley's chief in Asia said Thai companies were
unwilling to make issues at the previous high yields, but if
corporate bonds could fall to 6 percent above U.S. Treasuries,
things could look different.
	   U.S. interest rates have come down sharply in recent weeks and
the Federal Reserve has said it is willing to make further rate
cuts to cushion the impact of Asia's economic slowdown on the U.S.
economy.

Guerrillas attack Israeli-allied militia in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas fired mortars and
rocket-propelled grenades at Israeli-backed militiamen Sunday,
provoking Israeli air and artillery retaliation, security officials
said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the early morning
fighting in the eastern sector of the Israeli-occupied buffer zone
in south Lebanon, the officials said.
	   Guerrillas attacked barracks of the South Lebanon Army militia
at Kawkaba inside the occupied enclave, 7 kilometers (4 miles)
southwest of the border town of Rashaya. There was no claim of
responsibility for the attack.
	   Israeli helicopters gunships scrambled to action as the
guerrillas were withdrawing from the area under a barrage of
artillery and tank fire from Israeli and militia positions,
according to the officials, who spoke on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   At least 150 shells blasted the area, the officials added.
	   The guerrillas are fighting to expel Israeli forces from the
440-square-mile (1,100-square-kilometer) enclave, which Israel
established in 1985 to guard against cross-border guerrilla forays.
The zone has a predominantly Shiite population of 200,000.

Alliance formed to protect press freedom in Southeast Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Journalists' organizations from Indonesia, the
Philippines and Thailand announced the formation of an alliance Sunday to
support and promote freedom of the press in Southeast Asia.
	   The Southeast Asian Press Alliance will set up a secretariat in Bangkok
next year to monitor attacks on journalists and threats to the press in the
region. The alliance will also encourage governments to ease restrictions on
the press.
	   ``This is a landmark development in the history of the Southeast Asian
press,'' said Kavi Chongkittavorn, a steering committee member and executive
editor of The Nation newspaper in Bangkok. ``We journalists have to be able
to defend ourselves and help our Asian colleagues.''
	   Thailand and the Philippines generally have the freest press in
Southeast Asia, while Indonesia's journalists have been seizing more liberty
since the downfall of longtime ruler Suharto in May.
	   The alliance grew out of a two-day seminar in press freedom in Southeast
Asia, hosted by the Reporter's Association of Thailand with the World Press
Freedom Committee and the U.S.-based Committee to Protect Journalists.
	   The alliance is meant to include independent journalistic organizations
in the region. The 25 delegates affirmed their commitment to support efforts
by journalists in less-free neighboring countries to establish a free press.
	   ``We support your efforts and applaud this endeavor,'' said James
Ottaway, chairman of the World Press Freedom Committee.
	   Delegates said it was the first time that regional press freedom
organizations had banded together to promote regional concerns.
	   The steering committee was drawn from the Reporters' Association of
Thailand, the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism, the Center for
Media Freedom and Responsibility of the Philippines, the Jakarta-based
Alliance of Independent Journalists, and the Institute for Studies in the
Free Flow of Information, based in Indonesia.

Indonesia braces for big protests as Assembly debates democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wiranto, Suharto only use one name. &QL; 
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military commander, Gen.
Wiranto, sidled up to one of thousands of soldiers on guard at the
national Parliament building last week and asked: ``What sort of
ammunition do you have?''
	   ``Blanks and rubber bullets only, sir,'' was the reply.
	   Wiranto smiled, showing that was just what he wanted to hear.
	   Five months ago, the military shot four student protesters to
death, triggering massive riots that killed about 1,200 people.
Much of Jakarta was set ablaze, and authoritarian President Suharto
was forced to resign after 32 years in power.
	   Now, the capital of 11 million people is bracing for more
turmoil as it prepares for another major turning point.
	   The Southeast Asian nation's highest legislative body meets
Tuesday to debate how to reform the tightly controlled political
system that kept Suharto in office for so long.
	   President B.J. Habibie has promised the four-day meeting of the
1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly will be ``a milestone''
on the road to democracy. He wants parliamentary elections to be
held next May, followed by the selection of a new head of state by
a newly designed Assembly at the end of 1999.
	   Despite his promises, students who led the crusade to oust
Suharto last May say they'll return to the streets because they
don't believe the Assembly will deliver true democratic reforms.
	   The convening of the Assembly also comes at a dangerous time for
the world's fourth most populous nation for other reasons.
	   Its worst economic crisis in decades drags on, bringing with it
high inflation and unemployment, and soaring poverty rates. Rioting
and looting have occurred sporadically since May in many areas.
	   There also has been a wave of mysterious killings in villages on
the main island of Java.
	   Gangs of masked assassins have been blamed for the slayings of
more than 150 Muslim clerics and others accused of black magic.
Many Indonesians still believe in the supernatural, and the
killings have led to mob lynchings of murder suspects.
	   To avoid violence during the Assembly meetings, Wiranto has
ordered 30,000 troops, police and other security personnel to
protect the Assembly in Jakarta, without going overboard. Another
120,000 civilians have been recruited to help keep the peace.
	   Critics say the Assembly is stacked with old supporters of
Suharto who will produce only cosmetic changes.
	   Opposition leaders who have been excluded from the Assembly
accuse Habibie, a close friend and longtime subordinate of Suharto,
of wanting to tighten his grip on the presidency under the guise of
reform.
	   ``Suharto has gone. But the forces of his status quo remain very
much intact,'' said Amien Rais, a prominent Islamic leader and
presidential candidate. ``The process of reform has come to a
deadlock or stalemate.''
	   Habibie clearly intends to stand for office again. But he denies
planning to use the Assembly to strengthen his position.
	   Habibie has tried hard over the past few months to distance
himself from the authoritarian past. He's apologized for human
rights abuses committed under Suharto, released some political
prisoners, enacted laws to bolster freedom of speech, and pledged
to fix the economy along with the International Monetary Fund.
	   For years, the Assembly was infamous for simply rubber stamping
Suharto's every wish. But this time Habibie won't necessarily have
it his own way. His agenda is expected to draw an unprecedented and
heated legislative debate, while thousands protest outside.
	   Students and pro-democracy activists charge that Habibie is
operating in the shadow of Suharto, now a recluse in his central
Jakarta home. They say the government has been unable to find
concrete evidence that the 77-year-old former autocrat illegally
enriched himself and his family during his three decades in power.
	   Last week, a big campus rally demanded Suharto face trial for
``political and economic crimes.''
	   Just as controversial is Habibie's refusal to end the military's
role in politics. The armed forces have been a powerful part of the
government since Suharto, then an army general, put down an alleged
Communist coup in 1965, and later took power.
	   Several former and current generals are ministers in Habibie's
Cabinet or close advisers.
	   The armed forces still directly appoint 75 representatives in
the 500-member Parliament. Habibie wants that reduced to 55 seats,
but pro-democracy groups want all such appointments ended.
	   For years the military has been accused of widespread human
rights abuses across Indonesia. Now, it's under enormous pressure
to reform.
	   Last week, a government-appointed fact-finding team claimed that
military personnel helped incite the unrest that led to Suharto's
downfall.
	   Wiranto has taken some steps to clean up the military's ranks. A
general and son-in-law of Suharto blamed for some of the mayhem has
been dismissed and might soon face court martial for kidnapping
anti-government activists earlier this year.
	   Security personnel charged with fatally shooting the four
students before the May riots are to be tried.
	   Nevertheless, it seems clear that Habibie, who has never stood
for election as president, won't move too hard or fast against his
generals. And no one is sure how the military will respond this
week if big protests materialize, as expected, near Parliament and
the presidential palace.

Goh calls for kinder, gentler Singapore
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Amid wage-cutting proposals and increased
unemployment, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong urged Singaporeans
Sunday to be especially kind to each other this week.
	   ``When the economic pie shrinks, some people tend to look after
themselves only as they compete for jobs or struggle to keep their
businesses alive,'' he said at the launch of ``The Singapore
Kindness Week.''
	   ``Yet, it is precisely during such difficult times that kindness
and consideration are needed,'' Goh said, adding that ``thoughtful
acts of kindness make us a better people.''
	   The tightly run island state of 3.1 million stages many
campaigns, from keeping public toilets clean to promoting courtesy
on the Internet.
	   The regional crisis has been increasingly felt in affluent
Singapore, where ordinarily low unemployment is expected to climb
to 9 percent by next year.
	   Singapore's largest employer is the government, which employs
66,000 and so far has not announced any layoffs. The Singapore
Kindness Movement is supported by the Ministry of Information and
the Arts and funded by a government grant.

Man resisting court order sets off grenade

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A man resisting a court order set off a grenade,
killing himself and injuring seven court officials in China's
southern province of Guangdong, according to an official report
seen Sunday in Beijing.
	   Court officials in the Guangdong city of Chaoyang were
attempting Thursday to deliver papers ordering Liao Chuxian, the
manager at a hotel, to pay 950,000 yuan (dlrs 115,000) that he owed
to another man. Refusing to take the papers, he fled, returning
with the grenade, the local newspaper Yangcheng Evening News
reported Saturday.
	   Two of the seven injured in the blast remained in serious
condition, the report said. It said that police who searched Liao's
home after the explosion found a cache of weapons and ammunition.

Indonesia braces for big protests as Assembly debates democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS students occupied Parliament in May, graf 4; warships in
Jakarta Bay, graf 13; Wiranto, Suharto only use one name &QL; 
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's military commander, Gen.
Wiranto, sidled up to one of thousands of soldiers on guard at the
national Parliament building last week and asked: ``What sort of
ammunition do you have?''
	   ``Blanks and rubber bullets only, sir,'' was the reply.
	   Wiranto smiled, showing that was just what he wanted to hear.
	   Five months ago, the military shot four student protesters to
death, triggering massive riots that killed about 1,200 people.
Much of Jakarta was set ablaze, students occupied the Parliament,
and authoritarian President Suharto was forced to resign after 32
years in power.
	   Now, the capital of 11 million people is bracing for more
turmoil as it prepares for another major turning point.
	   The Southeast Asian nation's highest legislative body meets
Tuesday to debate how to reform the tightly controlled political
system that kept Suharto in office for so long.
	   President B.J. Habibie has promised the four-day meeting of the
1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly will be ``a milestone''
on the road to democracy. He wants parliamentary elections to be
held next May, followed by the selection of a new head of state by
a newly designed Assembly at the end of 1999.
	   Despite his promises, students who led the crusade to oust
Suharto in May say they'll return to the streets because they don't
believe the Assembly will deliver true democratic reforms.
	   The convening of the Assembly also comes at a dangerous time for
the world's fourth most populous nation for other reasons.
	   Its worst economic crisis in decades drags on, bringing with it
high inflation and unemployment, and soaring poverty rates. Rioting
and looting have occurred sporadically since May in many areas.
	   There also has been a wave of mysterious killings in villages on
the main island of Java.
	   Gangs of masked assassins have been blamed for the slayings of
more than 150 Muslim clerics and others accused of black magic.
Many Indonesians still believe in the supernatural, and the
killings have led to mob lynchings of murder suspects.
	   To avoid violence during the Assembly meetings, Wiranto has
ordered 30,000 troops, police and other security personnel to
protect the Assembly in Jakarta, without going overboard. Another
120,000 civilians have been recruited to help keep the peace. In a
show of strength, the navy has stationed several warships in
Jakarta Bay.
	   Critics say the Assembly is stacked with old supporters of
Suharto who will produce only cosmetic changes.
	   Opposition leaders who have been excluded from the Assembly
accuse Habibie, a close friend and longtime subordinate of Suharto,
of wanting to tighten his grip on the presidency under the guise of
reform.
	   ``Suharto has gone. But the forces of his status quo remain very
much intact,'' said Amien Rais, a prominent Islamic leader and
presidential candidate. ``The process of reform has come to a
deadlock or stalemate.''
	   Habibie clearly intends to stand for office again. But he denies
planning to use the Assembly to strengthen his position.
	   Habibie has tried hard over the past few months to distance
himself from the authoritarian past. He's apologized for human
rights abuses committed under Suharto, released some political
prisoners, enacted laws to bolster freedom of speech, and pledged
to fix the economy along with the International Monetary Fund.
	   For years, the Assembly was infamous for simply rubber stamping
Suharto's every wish. But this time Habibie won't necessarily have
it his own way. His agenda is expected to draw an unprecedented and
heated legislative debate, while thousands protest outside.
	   Students and pro-democracy activists charge that Habibie is
operating in the shadow of Suharto, now a recluse in his central
Jakarta home. They say the government has been unable to find
concrete evidence that the 77-year-old former autocrat illegally
enriched himself and his family during his three decades in power.
	   Last week, a big campus rally demanded that Suharto face trial
for ``political and economic crimes.''
	   Just as controversial is Habibie's refusal to end the military's
role in politics. The armed forces have been a powerful part of the
government since Suharto, then an army general, put down an alleged
Communist coup in 1965, and later took power.
	   Several former and current generals are ministers in Habibie's
Cabinet or close advisers.
	   The armed forces still directly appoint 75 representatives in
the 500-member Parliament. Habibie wants that reduced to 55 seats,
but pro-democracy groups want all such appointments ended.
	   For years, the military has been accused of widespread human
rights abuses across Indonesia. Now, it's under enormous pressure
to reform.
	   Last week, a government-appointed fact-finding team claimed that
military personnel helped incite the unrest that led to Suharto's
downfall.
	   Wiranto has taken some steps to clean up the military's ranks. A
general and son-in-law of Suharto blamed for some of the mayhem has
been dismissed and might soon face court martial for kidnapping
anti-government activists earlier this year.
	   Security personnel charged with fatally shooting the four
students before the May riots are to be tried.
	   Nevertheless, it seems clear that Habibie, who has never stood
for election as president, won't move too hard or fast against his
generals. And no one is sure how the military will respond this
week if big protests materialize, as expected, near Parliament and
the presidential palace.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Victor Pujol's overtime goal earned
Spain a 3-2 victory over Germany and fifth spot in the 20th
Champions Trophy men's field hockey tournament on Sunday.
	   Germany, the defending champions, and Spain, were tied 2-2 after
the scheduled play finished.
	   Seven minutes into overtime play and Juan Escarre's dodged three
German defenders to set up an easy opportunity for Pujol, who
hammered in the winning goal.
	   During regulation play, Germany was leading 2-1 when Sascha
Relnelt scored in the 63rd minute. Just six minutes later, Xavier
Ribas scored the equalizer for Spain.
	   Escarre put Spain on the scoreboard just seven minutes into the
game with a superb indirect drill. Germany's Christian Achtmann
scored their equalizer in the 27th minute of play.
	   Result: Spain 3 (Juan Escarre (7th min), Xavier Ribas (69th
min); Victor Pujol (77th min); Germany 2 (Christian Achtmann (27th
min), Sascha Relnelt (63rd min).
	   Teams: Spain: Ramon Jufresa, Xavier Ribas, Franciso Fabregas,
Juan Escarre, Pablo Amat, Jordi Casas, Xavier Arnau, Ramon Sala,
Josep Sanchez, Pablo Usoz (captain), Bernardino Herreros, Rodrigo
Garza, Eduardo Aguilar, Santiago Ferran.
	   Germany: Christopher Reitz (captain), Philipp Crone, Max Klink,

Plushenko, Liashenko win gold medals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout. INSERTS new 12th graf with pairs results. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMLOOPS, British Columbia (AP) _ Evgney Plushenko, a
16-year-old Russian, and Elena Liashenko, a 22-year-old Ukrainian,
won the men's and women's events at the Sun Life Skate Canada
International on Saturday night.
	   Both Plushenko and Liashenko earned dlrs 30,000 for the gold
medal performances.
	   Plushenko landed six triples and a perfect quad toe loop _ in
combination with a triple toe loop _ and received seven 5.9s, a 5.8
and a 5.7 on the technical side, and five 5.9s and four 5.7s on the
artistic side to finish ahead of three-time world champion Elvis
Stojko of Canada, while Szabolcs Vidrai of Hungary was third.
	   Plushenko, who skated last, won the bronze medal at last March's
world championships when Stojko didn't compete because of a groin
injury. He proved with this win that he'll be a serious contender
next spring at the world championships at Helsinki.
	   ``Elvis has been an example of an athlete I should emulate,''
Plushenko said through his coach Alexei Mishkin, who also acted as
his interpreter during the news conference. ``I am working not only
to beat world champions but Olympic champions. This is my goal.''
	   Mishkin had some bad news for Plushenko's rivals.
	   ``He's very far from his real possibilities,'' he said. ``He can
be better. This is an important period for him. He is growing so
quickly now _ almost 4{ inches in the last year.''
	   Stojko, 26, was fourth at Skate America in Detroit eight days
ago. That was his first competition since winning the Olympic
silver medal despite a painful groin injury.
	   All nine judges gave Stojko a 5.8 for technical content. For
artistry, he got five 5.8s, three 5.7s and one 5.6.
	   ``It felt great,'' Stojko said. ``It's another step up.''
	   Fumie Suguri of Japan was second and top-seeded Irina Slutskaya
of Russia was third in the women's competition.
	   In the pairs event, Xue Shen and Hongbo Zhao of China finished
first, edging Russians Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov in a 5-4
split of the judging panel. Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of
Canada won the bronze.
	   Liashenko was pegged by some as a future world champion after
placing sixth in her first world championships in 1994. That was to
be her best finish, however, as she was ninth in 1995, 12th in
1996, failed to qualify in 1997 and the finished a solid seventh
this year.
	   Skate Canada is the second international win of her career.
	   ``I was hoping to win here,'' Liashenko said through an
interpreter. ``I really wanted to win this time.''
	   Suguri landed five triple jumps and stepped out of two others.
Her technical marks ranged from 5.3 to 5.7 out of the possible 6.0,
and her artistic marks were 5.5s and 5.6s.
	   Liashenko followed and also landed five triples, doubling out on
two others. Six of the nine judges had Liashenko first and Suguri
second.
	   ``It was one of the best,'' she said when asked how she would
rank Saturday's performance.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tears are plentiful in Kosovo these
days, welling up slowly as a voice quavers or pouring suddenly from
tired eyes surveying rubble that was a home or bones that were a
man.
	   Men weep beside the ruins of their houses. Women wail at
funerals. Refugee children sob inside the cold, unfamiliar walls of
a stranger's house.
	   The fighting that killed hundreds and left tens of thousands
homeless may have ended, but the towering task of rebuilding lives
and somehow resolving a deeply rooted political and ethnic conflict
has barely started.
	   With the Balkan winter imminent, that means months more misery
for those who have suffered the most.
	   The hardship faced by an estimated 150,000 refugees who still
have not returned to their homes in the predominantly ethnic
Albanian province already was overwhelming.
	   A visitor to virtually any village in the mostly devastated
countryside encounters people facing almost unimaginable trauma,
both physical and emotional. All tell the same story _ shelling and
attack by Serb forces, families hiding in the woods for months,
returning to loss and grief.
	   In Bobovac village in central Kosovo, a young woman held a
canvas bag containing the bones of her uncle, who was killed three
months earlier by a Serb artillery shell. His remains lay where he
fell until the family returned last week.
	   Near the border with Albania, a woman explained that she sleeps
in her clothes in case she has to flee suddenly in the night. A few
miles away, Zenel Ahmeti cried at the destruction in Jablanica
while his daughter, Florije, tried to put the pain of her people
into words.
	   ``We had everything before the Serb offensive and now we don't
have a place to spend the night,'' she sobbed. ``We never believed
that this could happen to us. I've lost the will for living. We've
lost our hope.''
	   An estimated 300,000 Kosovars, most of them ethnic Albanians,
fled the fighting that began in February when Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic cracked down on Albanian separatists in the
province.
	   About half went abroad, relief officials believe, and most of
the rest moved to the larger cities such as Pristina, the
provincial capital, and a few others unaffected by the fighting.
More than 50,000 hid in the mountains and woods.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes to force Milosevic to end the offensive a month ago.
Under an agreement he signed with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke,
extra military and police forces sent to Kosovo for the crackdown
had to withdraw and people were supposed to be free to return to
their homes.
	   Four weeks later, Western officials and relief agencies believe
the initial goals of the agreement have mostly been reached.
Fernando del Mundo of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said
dropping temperatures and the reduced presence of Serb police in
some areas have brought virtually all refugees down from the
mountains and into villages.
	   Convoys of emergency food and other supplies have been delivered
mostly without incident, and U.S. officials and others say they
have averted the threat of a humanitarian catastrophe _ refugees
dying of starvation and exposure in the woods.
	   That amounts to dodging one form of crisis for a less dangerous
but still threatening situation. With entire villages damaged
beyond any kind of immediate repair and the wet, freezing winter
weather expected any day, many refugees have been unable to move
into their homes. They live instead in crowded conditions in the
houses of friends and relatives.
	   Del Mundo described his agency's goals simply: Deliver food and
supplies regularly, and help people construct some kind of
temporary shelter to get them through the winter.
	   ``There's no way you can reconstruct the houses,'' he said.
``The best you can hope for is one warm room for the entire
family.''
	   Relief agencies spent the past week scouring the region to
compile a census of where people are and how many homes and
villages have been damaged or destroyed. The report, expected soon,
will provide a framework for how to proceed with delivering aid,
del Mundo said.
	   The Serb attack on the province's Albanians was a systematic
campaign to force as many as possible to flee forever. Besides the
routine looting and burning of villages, schools and hospitals were
ransacked and wells contaminated with animal carcasses.
	   In Malisevo, a virtual ghost town in central Kosovo, teacher
Rexhep Mazreku, 38, rummaged through the debris that was his
classroom.
	   ``They've broken about everything,'' he muttered. ``Look what
they did here. Look.''
	   Diplomas from the Albanians' self-run education system, the
result of a boycott of Serb-run education, have been vandalized,
with Republic of Kosovo crossed out and Greater Serbia written over
it.
	   Publicly, Western diplomats and relief officials point out major
changes: The fighting has stopped. Refugees are down from the
hills. People generally have free movement. Relief supplies are
reaching them.
	   Privately, they are less optimistic. U.S. officials speaking on
condition of anonymity say sporadic violence by both Serb forces
and ethnic Albanian guerrillas is increasing. That could scuttle
immediate progress needed to have any chance to help refugees
further before winter sets in.
	   Serb police continue to operate checkpoints that limit movement
in the countryside, particularly for young Albanian men who say
they are accused of being guerrilla fighters of the Kosovo
Liberation Army. That can mean immediate arrest, with a conviction
likely after a lengthy detention that can include torture, Albanian
lawyers say.
	   In some areas, the police presence, with patrols and the
checkpoints, keeps people from attending to basic needs like taking
a sick child to the doctor. Villagers complain of regular gunfire
by police, particularly at night, and routinely run into
surrounding fields and woods for safety.
	   ``It's the tenth time we've fled,'' Abdur Kelmendi said Thursday
as he and his cousin led their families, including a grandmother,
two infants and nine other children, down a road from Sibovos
village near Pristina.
	   Under the peace agreement, ethnic Albanians are supposed to
regain the self-rule stripped by Milosevic in 1989, allowing them
to create local institutions like a civilian police force.
	   A European-led mission of 2,000 unarmed observers is being
created to monitor Milosevic's compliance with the peace plan. But
the verification mission remains in the early stages, with the
official launch unlikely until late November at the soonest.
	   A civilian police force and similar steps must await a political
agreement, which is still snagged.
	   No matter the outcome of the political wrangling, the warfare
and its aftermath have widened the already intense ethnic divide of
Kosovo.
	   ``Things will never be the same,'' said Skender Berisha, 25, as
he cleared burned debris from a friend's shop in Malisevo. ``There
is no chance that we are going to live with them like we used to.
	   ``We were neighbors and we used to say hello to them. Right now,
if they expect us to live with them as neighbors, to get along with
them, that will never happen. They massacred women and children. We
can never do that.''

South Korea's Hyundai to export 13 ships worth dlrs 960 million
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's Hyundai Heavy Industries
Co. Ltd. said Sunday it has won three contracts totaling dlrs 960
million to build 13 ships for Swedish, Iranian and French
companies.
	   The first deal calls for Hyundai to build eight 316,000-metric
ton (347,600-short ton) oil carriers worth dlrs 650 million for
Stena AB, Sweden's largest shipping company.
	   For Iran Shipping Lines, Hyundai will build four ships worth
dlrs 160 million, which can carry 3,300 standard 20-foot containers
each.
	   The world's largest shipbuilder will also build a 343,000-ton
oil drilling and storage ship worth dlrs 150 million for a
consortium formed by France's Buoygues Offshore and McDermott-ETPM.
	   All the 13 ships should be delivered by 2001.
	   The contracts have boosted Hyundai's ship orders so far this
year to 61 ships worth dlrs 3.5 billion.
	   Hyundai Heavy Industries is a subsidiary of the Hyundai group,
South Korea's largest conglomerate.

Official: Russia won't print more than 15 billion rubles this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A top Russian official said the government will
limit the printing of new rubles to 15 billion rubles (dlrs 960
million) this year, an amount that will not stoke high inflation.
	   Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov refuted
claims by a former government official that the government had
already broken this limit.
	   ``We cannot disregard certain prohibitive limits,'' Maslyukov
said Saturday on the popular ``Vremya'' television program,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``Otherwise the result
would be hyperinflation, which would entail very serious
consequences.''
	   The government has acknowledged that it will have to print some
money to help pay off wage and pension debts. But it is still
unclear exactly how much has been, or will be printed, and some
observers say the government is likely to print much more than 15
billion rubles.
	   The ruble, which was hovering around 6 to the dollar before the
economic crisis struck in August, plunged as low as 20 to the
dollar after that.
	   After considerable turbulence, it has stabilized at around 16 to
the dollar in recent weeks.

Blewett scores ton against England
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Greg Blewett was in familiar
territory Sunday, scoring a century against England to lead South
Australia to a strong position at the Adelaide Oval.
	   Blewett, who scored centuries in his first three Ashes tests,
has since been dropped from the Australian test team and is
considered an outsider to return in the current series.
	   He was in commanding form Sunday with 143, his second
first-class ton in three games this season, as the hosts reached
262 for five at stumps on day two of the four-day game.
	   South Australia led by 75 on the first innings after dismissing
England for 187.
	   Blewett's 312 minute, 251 delivery innings included 11
boundaries and a six.
	   Allrounder Dominic Cork backed up his fighting half-century in
England's innings with 2-28 while Angus Fraser, Dean Headley and
part-time off-spinner Mark Ramprakash were the other successful
bowlers.

<TEXT>
	   NEW BRITAIN, Connecticut, (AP) _ Heinz J. Schaefers climbed into
the bathtub of his Connecticut apartment, slit his wrists and bled
to death on Sept. 6. His world had ended five days earlier, at
precisely 10 p.m.
	   At that hour, federal agents raided the microbiologist's
suburban home, seizing computer equipment, floppy disks, CD-ROMs
and modems. Similar raids were carried out simultaneously in 31
other U.S. cities and 11 other countries. Authorities had cracked
the largest, most sophisticated online child pornography ring yet _
a perverse enterprise called ``w0nderland.''
	   Its ranks, described by one official as ``its own little sick
society, with its own rules,'' allegedly included Schaefers, one of
more than 100 suspects arrested worldwide.
	   ``They are people that you could live next door to,'' said
Jackie Bennett, spokeswoman for Britain's National Crime Squad.
``What they've actually been doing is horrendous.''
	   Bennett's investigators, under the auspices of Interpol,
coordinated the worldwide sweep dubbed ``Operation Cheshire Cat''
in the United States and ``Operation Cathedral'' in the United
Kingdom.
	   Schaefers, a 35-year-old German immigrant who had worked at a
Connecticut health center since June 1997, allegedly traded tens of
thousands of kiddie porn pictures with his co-conspirators,
swapping them like baseball cards. Once the details became public,
he opted for death over disgrace.
	   He didn't die alone. Three other suspected w0nderland members
made the same choice within four days of the Sept. 1 raid: a lethal
combination of booze and drugs in Maine, a length of hose and an
exhaust pipe in Texas, a shotgun blast in Colorado.
	   The Maine suspect, a retired Air Force pilot, was typing on his
computer when authorities burst in. When he died two days later,
his pressed uniform hung in the closet, ready for his funeral. A
copy of the book ``Final Exit'' rested nearby.
	   ``Suicide in these cases is not an unusual event,'' said Gene
Weinschenk, head of the U.S. Customs CyberSmuggling Center. ``When
the bright light shines on them, many of them want to just blow up
their lives.''
	   Less than two months after the raid, those explosions have
resonated from coast to coast: the suicides, 10 other U.S. arrests,
promising careers ruined for a North Carolina medical student, a
Brooklyn law school student, a Georgia teacher.
	   Charges against another 20 suspects are possible; a ripple
effect as forensic experts pore over the suspects' computers could
result in charges for the next several years, officials said.
	   And there are hundreds of anonymous victims who may never be
found: the children whose photos were traded by the twisted
brotherhood of w0nderland. ``Each of those pictures,'' said Customs
spokeswoman Layne Lathrem, ``is a permanent record of a child being
abused.''
	   The members of w0nderland were literally the folks next door:
	   They hailed from towns like Broken Arrow, Oklahoma; Skowhegan,
Maine; Alpharetta, Georgia; West Orange, New Jersey. Three of its
U.S. members were women. All of its members had at least 10,000
pornographic images of children on their computers, as required for
club admission.
	   w0nderland's name stemmed from ``Alice in Wonderland'' author
Lewis Carroll's reputed penchant for photographing young girls, but
this went far beyond that pursuit. Its members shared pornography
involving children as young as 18 months.
	   ``The stuff that my offices are having to sift through are
horrific,'' Bennett said. ``How people can derive pleasure from
that is beyond me.''
	   The group took elaborate measures to hide its obsession,
operating with a sophistication never before seen, investigators
said.
	   ``They held town hall meetings in cyberspace to vote on
membership,'' Lathram says. ``They had this whole perverted little
community.''
	   w0nderland existed in the shadowy world of Internet Relay Chat,
an unmoderated part of the Internet where people can chat and
exchange files anonymously.
	   For less than dlrs 100 a month, w0nderland members apparently
bought access to this club and would go online, enter a private
chat room and agree to exchange photos. The photos were encrypted
with codes from the former Soviet KGB to prevent outsiders from
gaining access to them, Wienschenk said.
	   w0nderland operated in secrecy this way for at least two years,
although investigators are unsure when the ring originated.
	   To join, potential members needed a current member to vouch for
them. Candidates had their hard drives searched by the w0nderland
hierarchy to verify their cache of kiddie porn. The club had its
own pecking order: Producers of new pictures were acclaimed; so
were the techies who devised ways to hide the collections of
pedophelia.
	   Police were tipped off to the club's existence by following the
electronic trail from a child abuse allegation made in June 1996 in
San Jose, Calif.
	   A mother of a 10-year-old contacted police after her daughter
complained she had been molested by Ronald Allen Riva, 38, of
Salinas, California, at a slumber party for Riva's daughter. He was
accused of posing the girl for other members of the Orchid Club, a
smaller ring, who watched via live video on the Internet. Riva is
serving a life sentence without parole.

Seven killed by gunmen in northeastern India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ Unidentified gunmen fired on a crowd
gathered for a Hindu festival, killing seven and injuring 25,
police said Sunday.
	   Police suspected ethnic Bodo militants in the attack Saturday
because the victims were Assamese, in a village surrounded by Bodo
settlements. Police added the indiscriminate firing was typical of
a Bodo attack, though it was not clear to which of the two Bodo
militant groups operating in Assam state they belonged.
	   Both the Bodo Liberation Tiger Force and the National Democratic
Front of Bodoland want to carve out a separate Bodoland from Indian
territory for the Bodos, who consist of nearly 1.2 million of
Assam's 22 million people.
	   The attackers arrived on bicycle as villagers gathered at the
community sports field for ritual performances of scenes from the
life of the Hindu god Krishna. They fired with automatic assault
rifles.
	   The attack occurred in Jalah, a village 150 kilometers (90
miles) west of the state capital, Gauhati.

Police detain dissident in central China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A dissident based in the central Chinese city of
Changsha has been detained for 10 days for attempting to set up an
independent political group, a human rights group said Sunday.
	   Xie Changfa was taken from his home Saturday, a day after he had
applied to a Civil Affairs office for permission to set up an
organization called the ``China Association to Protect Citizens'
Rights and Interests,'' the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said.
	   The Hong Kong-based group said police had advised Xie's family
that he would be held for 10 days for violating regulations on
social order.
	   Xie, formerly an engineer at the Changsha Steel Works, spent two
years in a labor camp for his involvement in 1989 pro-democracy
demonstrations.
	   Along with six other Changsha dissidents, Xie was detained for
several days in August for requesting permission to hold a
demonstration appealing for the release of other jailed activists.
	   Even seeking police permission to demonstrate, as legally
required, carries the risk of arrest or of police harassment. The
dissidents had declared they would register an appeal, as allowed
by law, after the authorities rejected their protest request.
	   In a separate report, the Information Center said Bao Tong, the
most senior official jailed after the 1989 protests, had been
refused a passport, preventing him from traveling overseas.
	   Bao hoped to visit his son, Bao Pu, who lives in the United
States. But police had refused repeated requests for a passport,
the center cited Bao Pu as saying.
	   Bao Tong was a former top aide to Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang and once ran a think tank studying reforms of
China's arbitrary political system. He was arrested May 28, 1989,
apparently for leaking word that party conservatives planned to
crush the protests, and was put on trial in 1992.
	   Bao was released from jail in May 1996, but spent another 11
months in police detention after that. Special restrictions
attached to his release expired in May, entitling him to rights due
to any citizen, including the right to travel abroad, the center
said.
	   It speculated that the government might not allow Bao to travel
overseas because of his knowledge of China's secretive political
elite.

Son of deputy interior minister charged with attempted murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police have charged the son of the
deputy interior minister with the attempted murder of a police
officer who was injured in a wild chase when the suspect tried to
escape from a routine traffic stop.
	   A citizens' watchdog group also demanded that Poonpol Asavahame
be expelled as a member of Parliament, saying his presence degrades
the body.
	   Poonpol was taken into custody Wednesday and initially charged
with reckless driving and injuring two policemen.
	   The more serious attempted murder charge could result in a
lengthy prison term. He was also charged with treating officials
with contempt, resisting arrest, obstructing officials in the
course of their duty, and reckless driving causing injury.
	   Poonphol's father, Vatana Asavahame, is deputy interior minister
in Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's government. He has publicly said
he would let justice take its course, but has ordered his son _ who
is free on bail _ to visit the hospitalized officer regularly.
	   Police said they stopped the vehicle with two female students in
it because it had no insurance sticker.
	   One of the women telephoned Poonphol, who arrived, told police
not to interfere with him since he was an important person, and
drove off in the car, police said.
	   Two policemen were struck giving chase. One was slightly
injured. Police told the newspaper The Nation that the other, Sgt.
Maj. Kasem Promrattanapong, thrown off the car hood after being hit
by the speeding sedan, would have been justified using his gun in
self-defense.
	   It is likely Poonphol's case will never go to court. The rich
and powerful in Thailand routinely get away with crimes. In recent
incidents involving violence by sons of politicians and
businessmen, those charged have all escaped legal punishment.
	   Poonphol's father is frequently described as a ``godfather'' in
the Thai press. U.S. authorities have confirmed that Vatana has
been denied a visa to the United States because of suspicions that
he is tied to the narcotics trade, a charge he vigorously denies.
	   In 1996, Poonphol was charged with attempted murder after he
pistol-whipped a man and fired a shot that grazed his head when the
man bumped his pickup truck into Poonphol's car.
	   The charges were dropped after Poonphol paid compensation to the
victim.

South Korean workers demand speedy reforms to overcome economic

crisis &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Some 30,000 workers, farmers and
students marched in Seoul Sunday, demanding speedy reforms to
overcome South Korea's prolonged economic crisis.
	   ``It's one year since the economic crisis began but the
situation has not improved much,'' protesters said in a statement
before starting the 2-kilometer (1.25-mile) march in southern
Seoul.
	   More than 10,000 riot police were deployed for possible
violence, but there were no reports of arrests or clashes.
	   The march began after a ``people's rally'' on a riverbank,
during which participants strongly criticized what they felt was a
lack of progress in resolving South Korea's economic crisis.
	   Organizers of the rally, representing 60 labor and civic groups,
demanded, among other things, that the government disband the
nation's bloated, debt-ridden conglomerates and increase financial
assistance for the unemployed.
	   ``The lives of workers are becoming more and more impoverished
while company heads and government officials who are responsible
for the crisis have not been properly punished,'' they said in the
statement.
	   South Korea's family-controlled chaebol, or conglomerates, have
come under public criticism for their heavy borrowing to expand
business, which experts say is partly responsible for the country's
economic crisis.
	   About a dozen conglomerates collapsed under mounds of bank debts
last year, triggering a flight of foreign capital and fueling South
Korea's financial crisis.
	   A restructuring of those debt-ridden chaebol is a key promise
South Korea has made under a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the
International Monetary Fund late last year.
	   But critics say progress in government efforts to restructure
the chaebol has been slow.
	   South Korea's unemployment rate has risen to a 32-year high of
7.6 percent, with 1.65 million people out of work. Workers have
been complaining that they became scapegoats for corporate
mismanagement.

Tajikistan troops oust rebel forces holed up in ancient fortress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Government troops overpowered a
group of rebel fighters holed up in an northern city, and were
still fighting another band of militants in the restive Central
Asian republic Sunday.
	   More than 200 combatants and civilians have been killed since
the rebels launched raids in the northern part of the country
Wednesday.
	   Government troops ousted 40 rebels holed up in an ancient
fortress in the northern city of Khudzhand, taking at least 30 of
the militants hostage, said presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov.
	   Saidov said the government did not know how many were killed,
but said there were high casualties among the rebels.
	   The soldiers also freed dozens of Interior Ministry troops that
had been held hostage inside the Khudzhand fortress, about 200
kilometers (125 miles) north of the capital Dushanbe. The village
was the site of the first attack on Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, government troops were still fighting the estimated
200 remaining rebels in the northern village of Aini, about 160
kilometers (100 miles) north of the capital, after surrounding them
Saturday.
	   So far, 40 rebels have been killed and 10 government soldiers
wounded in the fighting, Saidov said.
	   The rebels are led by former army Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev, who
has demanded that President Emomali Rakhmonov free all political
prisoners and bring his supporters into the government. The
president has ruled out any talks with the rebels.
	   Tajikistan's rebels signed a peace treaty with the government
last year, formally ended five years of civil war between the
mostly Muslim opposition and Rakhmonov's hardline, secular
government. The main opposition groups are now participating in the
government and the armed forces.
	   Still, some rebel leaders do not recognize the accords and
continue attacks on a smaller scale throughout the poor,
mountainous former Soviet republic.

Report: Another term for Taiwan's Lee possible
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ President Lee Teng-hui could seek another
term as the Nationalist Party's best hope in 2000 if it performs
poorly in next month's general elections, a top adviser was
reported as saying Sunday.
	   Another term for Lee was among the ``myriad possibilities''
being considered by the ruling Nationalists before a conference
next year when the ticket will be decided, Tien Hung-mao was quoted
as saying by the China Times Express.
	   ``Running again is Lee Teng-hui's personal decision to make. ...
It is theoretically possible,'' it quoted Tien telling an academic
conference Saturday.
	   Lee, 75, has stated publicly that he would not seek another
term, and a reversal would likely arouse fierce opposition from
both inside and outside the party.
	   Tien, a presidential policy adviser and president of a leading
political think tank, reportedly admitted there could also be
problems overcoming a constitutional ban on more than two terms in
office.
	   But his comments seem to indicate the Nationalists have not
ruled out that possibility if the party is unable to find a
suitably strong candidate.
	   Most speculation on Lee's successor has focused on Vice
President Lien Chan, a respected scholar who is disliked by many
voters for his patrician airs, while powerful Taiwan Governor James
Soong and Premier Vincent Siew are mentioned as possible running
mates.
	   The likelihood of a Lee candidacy would grow if the Nationalists
perform poorly in the December elections for the national
legislature and the mayors of Taipei and Taiwan's second largest
city, Kaohsiung, the paper said.
	   Lee became president following the death in 1988 of Chiang
Ching-kuo, son of strongman Chiang Kai-shek, who ruled Taiwan under
martial law after moving his Nationalist government here from
mainland China in 1949. Lee was then elected to a six-year term by
an electoral college in 1990, and won a landslide victory in 1996
in Taiwan's first ever direct presidential election.
	   The island's first native-born head of state, Lee commands
immense respect among Taiwanese, even those in the opposition
parties.
	   Though they have held on to power during a transition to full
democracy over the past decade, the Nationalists have been weakened
by factional feuding and a reputation for corruption and
incompetence. The party was dealt a heavy blow in local elections
last year when the number of cities and counties under its control
was cut from 12 to six amid major gains by the main opposition
Democratic Progressive Party.

Asian financial officials discuss problems ahead

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Financial officials from 14
Asia-Pacific economies warned Sunday that major challenges and
``several risks'' remain before Asia's battered economies can
recover.
	   The deputy finance ministers and deputy central bank governors
met for two days to review progress on the ``Manila Framework,'' an
agreement reached last November to promote regional economic
stability.
	   Officials said one of the greatest challenges in the months
ahead was for crisis-hit economies to make the necessary progress
in corporate restructuring.
	   ``This calls for perseverance by individual economies to adhere
to sound economic policies that promote sustainable growth,'' the
group said in a statement.
	   It cited risks including slower global growth, with particular
mention of Russia's worsening economy, and the need to speed up
social programs to help the poor in crisis-hit countries.
	   Officials from the International Monetary Fund, Asian
Development Bank and World Bank attended the meeting, which also
discussed how to reform the international financial system and
improve monitoring of Asian economies.
	   Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director of the IMF, stressed
the need for corporate restructuring.
	   ``These are not easy things to do. They are difficult
technically, difficult politically and difficult to finance,''
Fischer told reporters.
	   But ``the fact we are discussing them in such detail is pretty
encouraging,'' he added.
	   Fischer predicted that unless there was another international
financial shock, the region's worst-hit countries would see
recovery by early next year.
	   ``The most badly affected countries are probably very close to
the bottom or at the bottom now,'' Fischer said, noting that
significant reform of banking systems has already been pushed
through.
	   Many of Asia's once thriving economies have spun into recession,
set off by a wave of currency devaluations that started more than a
year ago.
	   The worsening financial gloom is set to dominate talks at next
week's summit in Kuala Lumpur of leaders from the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States. Russia, Vietnam and Peru also will be at the summit.

	   Rahman, who led the country's independence war against Pakistan
in 1971, was gunned down by rebellious soldiers at his Dhaka
residence on Aug. 15 in 1975. Most of his family was also killed
that day; two daughters survived because they were out of the
country on holiday.
	   In its 27 years of history Bangladesh has witnessed the
assassination of two heads of government, three military coups and
19 failed coup attempts. Sunday's verdict ended the country's first
trial of coup leaders in a civil court. Military tribunals were set
up to try the leaders of other coups.
	   After 149 days of hearings, the verdict was handed down to
retired army officers Syed Farooqur Rahman, Sultan Shahriyar Rashid
Khan, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Khandaker Abdur Rashid, Aziz Pasha, Shariful
Haw Dalim, Bazlul Huda, Nor Chowdhury, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Rashed
Chowdhury, Ahmed Shariful Hasan, Kishmat Hashem, Abdul Majed,
Nazmul Ansar and Moslemuddin Ahmed.
	   The judge found Taheruddin Thakur, Abdul Wahab Joardar, Marfat
Ali Shah and Hashem Mridha not guilty.
	   Only five of the accused _ Syed Farooqur Rahman, Khan, Ahmed,
Wahab and former junior Information Minister Thakur _ were in court
to hear the verdicts. The government is trying to track down the
others, all believed to have fled Bangladesh.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Muslim rebels said Sunday they would
not continue peace talks with the government unless officials
recognize certain southern Philippine areas as rebel-held
territory.
	   In talks last week, the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front
demanded that government negotiators recognize 46 MILF camps as
rebel territory to prevent accidental encounters.
	   The government negotiators, however, refused and instead set
conditions that would ensure such recognition of rebel lands would
adhere to the constitution, said Al Haj Murad, the MILF's vice
chairman for military affairs. He said the conditions were
unacceptable.
	   The meeting, in the southern city of Marawi, ended without any
agreement.
	   ``We will not discuss any other issues with them unless this is
resolved,'' Murad said.
	   The MILF is the larger of two Muslim guerrilla groups still at
war with the government to establish an independent Islamic state
in the southern Philippines.
	   The government signed a peace accord in 1996 with the largest
rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front, and then opened
peace negotiations with the MILF, which controls large hinterland
areas in Mindanao.
	   Murad said the government has already agreed in principle to
grant such recognition under a cease-fire accord signed in August
last year, adding the recognition would not signify rebel
ownership, but control of the lands.
	   Once such recognition is given, government troops would have to
seek permission from the MILF before they could enter rebel areas.
But such arrangements would prevent accidental encounters since the
government would know where MILF troops are located, he said.
	   Murad said the government should implement the signed agreement
providing for the recognition of MILF areas so the rebels would
have a guarantee that it would abide by other accords.
	   For recognition, the government negotiators were requiring,
among other things, that MILF camps should at least have 1,500
armed rebels and conform with military standards in terms of the
presence of certain facilities, Murad said.
	   He said that was unacceptable since smaller MILF camps could not
conform with government specifications, and would be refused
recognition in violation of the cease-fire accord.
	   Philippine officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   Of the 46 MILF camps all over the southern region of Mindanao,
13 are major ones and 33 are minor camps, many of which have fewer
than the required 1,500 armed combatants.
	   The MILF maintains its main camp in Maguindanao, about 880
kilometers (550 miles) southeast of Manila.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A trial delayed 23 years by
Bangladesh's bitter and often bloody politics culminated Sunday
with a judge convicting and ordering death for 15 former military
commanders in the 1975 assassination of the country's first prime
minister.
	   Four others, including a former junior minister for information,
were acquitted in the killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, father of
current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. After taking office in 1996,
Hasina used her power to bring her father's killers to trial,
saying ensuring justice would help entrench democracy in this
volatile country.
	   Thousands of followers of Sheikh Mujib, as he is popularly known
in Bangladesh, danced in the streets outside the courtroom to
celebrate the verdict by Dhaka District Judge Kazi Golam Rasul.
Shouts of ``justice has prevailed!'' rang out.
	   Rahman, who led the country's independence war against Pakistan
in 1971, was gunned down by rebellious soldiers at his Dhaka
residence on Aug. 15 in 1975. Most of his family was also killed
that day; two daughters survived because they were out of the
country on holiday.
	   In its 27 years of history Bangladesh has witnessed the
assassination of two heads of government, three military coups and
19 failed coup attempts. Sunday's verdict ended the country's first
trial of coup leaders in a civil court. Military tribunals were set
up to try the leaders of other coups.
	   After 149 days of hearings, the verdict was handed down to
retired army officers Syed Farooq Rahman, Sultan Shahriyar Rashid
Khan, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Khandaker Abdur Rashid, Aziz Pasha, Shariful
Haw Dalim, Bazlul Huda, Nor Chowdhury, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Rashed
Chowdhury, Ahmed Shariful Hasan, Kishmat Hashem, Abdul Majed,
Nazmul Ansar and Moslemuddin Ahmed.
	   The judge found Taheruddin Thakur, Abdul Wahab Joardar, Marfat
Ali Shah and Hashem Mridha not guilty.
	   Only five of the accused _ Syed Farooqur Rahman, Khan, Ahmed,
Wahab and former junior Information Minister Thakur _ were in court
to hear the verdicts. The government is trying to track down the
others, all believed to have fled Bangladesh.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A trial delayed 23 years by
Bangladesh's bitter and often bloody politics culminated Sunday
with a judge convicting and ordering death for 15 former military
commanders in the 1975 assassination of the country's first prime
minister.
	   Four others, including a former junior minister for information,

Hasina used her power to bring her father's killers to trial,
saying ensuring justice would help entrench democracy in this

	   Thousands of followers of Sheikh Mujib, as he is popularly known
in Bangladesh, danced in the streets outside the courtroom to
celebrate the verdict by Dhaka District Judge Kazi Golam Rasul.
Shouts of ``justice has prevailed!'' rang out.
	   Rasul ordered the sentences carried out in public by firing
squad. Those convicted have the right to appeal.
	   Rahman, who led the country's independence war against Pakistan
in 1971, was gunned down by rebellious soldiers at his Dhaka
residence on Aug. 15 in 1975. Most of his family was also killed
that day; two daughters survived because they were out of the
country on holiday.
	   Months earlier, Rahman had instituted one-party rule and gave
himself more powers. His critics had accused him of authoritarian
rule and corruption, but his daughter says he was trying to ensure
order and would have restored democracy if he had been given time.
	   Rahman's killers granted themselves amnesties, and in the
ensuing political turmoil no one ever moved to bring them to trial
until Hasina came to power.
	   In its 27 years of history Bangladesh has witnessed the
assassination of two heads of government _ the first was Rahman;
three military coups; and 19 failed coup attempts. Sunday's verdict
ended the country's first trial of coup leaders in a civil court.
Military tribunals were set up to try the leaders of other coups.
	   After 149 days of hearings, the verdict was handed down to
retired army officers Syed Farooq Rahman, Sultan Shahriyar Rashid
Khan, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Khandaker Abdur Rashid, Aziz Pasha, Shariful
Haq Dalim, Bazlul Huda, Noor Chowdhury, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Rashed
Chowdhury, Ahmed Shariful Hasan, Kishmat Hashem, Abdul Majed,
Nazmul Ansar and Moslemuddin Ahmed.
	   The judge found Taheruddin Thakur, Abdul Wahab Joardar, Marfat
Ali Shah and Hashem Mridha not guilty.
	   Only five of the accused _ Syed Farooq Rahman, Khan, Ahmed,
Wahab and former junior Information Minister Thakur _ were in court
to hear the verdicts. The government is trying to track down the
others, all believed to have fled Bangladesh.
	   Fearing the verdict would spark violence, authorities had
deployed more than 10,000 security forces in Dhaka, the capital
city of 9 million.
	   Political violence, which is common in Bangladesh, escalated on
the eve of the verdict on Saturday when clashes between opposition
activists and supporters of Hasina killed one person in Dhaka.
	   The government accused the opposition of trying to derail the
trial. Opposition leader Khaleda Zia denied the charge, accused
Hasina's government of incompetence and corruption, and called for
a nationwide general strike Monday and Tuesday.

Takanohana wins, Akebono stays out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Takanohana won his opening bout Sunday in
the 15-day Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament, an event that fellow
yokozuna (grand champion) Akebono from Hawaii is sitting out with a
back injury.
	   Ozeki (champion) Takanonami was upset by No. 1 maegashira
(senior wrestler) Kaio, who grabbed his belt quickly and bulldozed
him out.
	   Takanohana, seeking his 21st tournament title and third in a
row, charged komusubi (junior champion second class) Kotonowaka
with an arm throw attempt and drove him out.
	   Takanohana won the previous tournament in September with a 13-2
record.
	   Yokozuna Wakanohana, Takanohana's elder brother, who has won
five tournaments, was lifted to the ring's edge by komusubi Dejima,
but counterattacked and bulldozed his foe out.
	   Ozeki (champion) Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani from Hawaii,
seized a belt hold against No. 1 maegashira Tochiazuma and forced
him out. Musashimaru ended at 11-4 in the previous tournament.
	   Sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai sent out No. 2 maegashira
Higonoumi with hand thrusts.
	   No. 12 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa,
dodged No. 11 maegashira Terao's hand thrusts, grabbed his belt and
crushed him down.
	   Kyokushuzan finished the previous tournament at 4-11 and was
demoted to his present rank from No. 5 maegashira.
	   Akebono, or Chad Rowan, withdrew from the tournament because of
back pain suffered in practice last Monday.
	   ``I can't even squat down because of pain. ... It's very
disappointing to stay out the tournament,'' Akebono said in an
interview with the Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK).
	   The 29-year-old Akebono, who now is receiving medical treatment
in Tokyo, wound up the previous tournament at 10-5. He has won nine
tournaments.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 10-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo
Salomon, lost his opening bout to No. 11-ranked Dewataira by an arm
throw.
	   Hoshitango finished the previous tournament at 9-6 and was
promoted to his present ranking from No. 13.
	   No. 2-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, was
thrown down by No. 3-ranked Oohinode.
	   Kyokutenho was promoted to his present rank from No. 5 after
finishing at 8-7 in the previous tournament.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 56-ranked
Kyokutenzan, or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, threw down No.
57-ranked Takinooto.
	   No. 8-ranked Kaishinzan, or American Henry Armstrong Miller,
toppled equally ranked Tochifudo with an arm throw.
	   Yamato, or American George Kalima, has retired after wrestling
eight years, the Sumo Association said.
	   Yamato, who ranked No. 49 in the previous tournament, where he
finished 5-2, was reported suffering from kidney trouble.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No. 15-ranked
Ryuko, or Brazilian Luis Go Ikemori, forced out No. 16-ranked
Kotosakuta.
	   No. 47-ranked Azumakaze was thrown down by No. 48-ranked Subaru.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
tournament.

Police detain dissident in central China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES in 1st graf that 10-day detention just starting &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A dissident based in the central Chinese city of
Changsha has begun 10 days in police detention for attempting to
set up an independent political group, a human rights group said
Sunday.
	   Xie Changfa was taken from his home Saturday, a day after he had
applied to a Civil Affairs office for permission to set up an
organization called the ``China Association to Protect Citizens'
Rights and Interests,'' the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said.
	   The Hong Kong-based group said police had advised Xie's family
that he would be held for 10 days for violating regulations on
social order.
	   Xie, formerly an engineer at the Changsha Steel Works, spent two
years in a labor camp for his involvement in 1989 pro-democracy
demonstrations.
	   Along with six other Changsha dissidents, Xie was detained for
several days in August for requesting permission to hold a
demonstration appealing for the release of other jailed activists.
	   Even seeking police permission to demonstrate, as legally
required, carries the risk of arrest or of police harassment. The
dissidents had declared they would register an appeal, as allowed
by law, after the authorities rejected their protest request.
	   In a separate report, the Information Center said Bao Tong, the
most senior official jailed after the 1989 protests, had been
refused a passport, preventing him from traveling overseas.
	   Bao hoped to visit his son, Bao Pu, who lives in the United
States. But police had refused repeated requests for a passport,
the center cited Bao Pu as saying.
	   Bao Tong was a former top aide to Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang and once ran a think tank studying reforms of
China's arbitrary political system. He was arrested May 28, 1989,
apparently for leaking word that party conservatives planned to
crush the protests, and was put on trial in 1992.
	   Bao was released from jail in May 1996, but spent another 11
months in police detention after that. Special restrictions
attached to his release expired in May, entitling him to rights due
to any citizen, including the right to travel abroad, the center
said.
	   It speculated that the government might not allow Bao to travel
overseas because of his knowledge of China's secretive political
elite.

Controversial businessman blames Communists for Russia's troubles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Communist Party is causing the country to
splinter and should be banned, a prominent and controversial
businessman said Sunday.
	   Russian business tycoon Boris Berezovsky criticized the
Communists for their continued support of parliament deputy Albert
Makashov, a Communist who received only a light reprimand from his
party after making anti-Semitic remarks last month.
	   ``As was the case with the Soviet Union, which split into ethnic
entities, the Communists are now causing the Russian Federation to
split into ethnic entities,'' Berezovsky said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Some Communist speakers at Saturday rallies celebrating the 81st
anniversary of Russia's revolution said Makashov was a hero who was
unfairly vilified by other politicians and the press for his
remarks.
	   ``By expressing their solidarity with Makashov at a rally in
Moscow on Nov. 7, the Communists placed themselves outside
civilized laws and outside Russian laws,'' said Berezovsky, who is
of Jewish origins.
	   Berezovsky, who heads the Commonwealth of Independent States, a
loose coalition of former Soviet republics, also said that the
Communist Party was to blame for the collapse of the Soviet Union
and ``must be immediately banned in Russia.''
	   The Communists are the country's leading opposition group and
have the largest faction in parliament's lower house, the State
Duma.
	   The Communists have frequently criticized Russia's business
``oligarchs,'' including Berezovsky, saying they have taken control
of large chunks of the economy through corrupt, insider deals.
	   The businessmen in turn have been critical of the Communists,
saying they are determined to keep economic control in state hands.

 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Some 30,000 workers, farmers and
students marched in Seoul Sunday, demanding speedy reforms to
overcome South Korea's prolonged economic crisis.
	   ``It's one year since the economic crisis began but the
situation has not improved much,'' protesters said in a statement
before starting the 2-kilometer (1.25-mile) march in southern
Seoul.
	   More than 10,000 riot police were deployed for possible
violence. There was some brief pulling and pushing between the two
sides, but no reports of arrests or serious clashes.
	   The march began after a ``people's rally'' on a riverbank,
during which participants strongly criticized what they felt was a
lack of progress in resolving South Korea's economic crisis.
	   Organizers of the rally, representing 60 labor and civic groups,
demanded, among other things, that the government disband the
nation's bloated, debt-ridden conglomerates and increase financial
assistance for the unemployed.
	   ``The lives of workers are becoming more and more impoverished
while company heads and government officials who are responsible
for the crisis have not been properly punished,'' they said in the
statement.
	   South Korea's family-controlled chaebol, or conglomerates, have
come under public criticism for their heavy borrowing to expand
business, which experts say is partly responsible for the country's
economic crisis.
	   About a dozen conglomerates collapsed under mounds of bank debts
last year, triggering a flight of foreign capital and fueling South
Korea's financial crisis.
	   A restructuring of those debt-ridden chaebol is a key promise
South Korea has made under a dlrs 58 billion bailout from the
International Monetary Fund late last year.
	   But critics say progress in government efforts to restructure
the chaebol has been slow.
	   South Korea's unemployment rate has risen to a 32-year high of
7.6 percent, with 1.65 million people out of work. Workers have
been complaining that they became scapegoats for corporate
mismanagement.

Rousseau arrives to meet with his West Indian players
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ West Indian Cricket Board President Pat Rousseau
arrived Sunday in London to help settle a pay dispute that
threatens to wipe out the islanders first offical tour of South
Africa.
	   Rousseau, who traveled overnight from the Caribbean, fired
captain Brian Lara and vice-captain Carl Hopper on Wednesday over
demands for better pay, which set off the boycott.
	   Courtney Walsh, the head of the players' association, said he
needed to talk directly with Rousseau.
	   ``The president coming is good news,'' Walsh said. ``We're
looking forward to it.''
	   ``It's not just about money, it's general conditions and
everything.''
	   South African cricket chief Ali Bacher, after talking by
telephone Saturday with Rousseau, said he was confident the tour
would go on as scheduled and that Lara and Hooper would be
reinstated.
	   ``While I cannot disclose what Mr. Rousseau told me, I'm certain
in my own mind that all problems will be resolved,'' Bacher said.
	   Bacher, West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd, and WICB member
Joel arrived in London Friday and have held two days of informal _
and so far _ unfruitful talks with the players.
	   West Indian management and striking players are camped in
neighboring hotels near London's Heathrow Airport with players
practicing to stay fit.
	   Lloyd said the players deserved to be well paid, but said
negotiations should have been completed before the tour started.
	   The tour is scheduled to start with a one-day match at
Johannesburg on Tuesday. The first test is due to start on Nov. 26.
	   A key to settling the dispute is a letter sent to the players by
South African President Nelson Mandela. This would be the West
Indies' first official tour of South Africa since the end of
apartheid.
	   ``He (Mandela) conveyed the importance of this tour to our
country,'' Bacher said. ``He asked that the parties concerned
compromise, show goodwill, good intent and come to an amicable
solution which will ensure the tour takes place.''
	   ``This tour is very important for this country,'' Bacher added.
``It goes beyond bat and ball. It will help enormously towards the
reconciliation process in South Africa and will inspire the youth
of the country.''
	   Reported solutions include more prize money, increased meal
money, and the reinstatement of Lara and Hopper to the squad. There
are also suggestions Walsh would be named captain.
	   The WICB has said it would fine the no-show players between 5
and 10 percent of their tour fees, which could be as much as dlrs
60,000 for Lara.
	   Lara and Hooper have wide support. Only seven of the 16 members
of the squad traveled to South Africa, and all returned Friday to
London to rally around the two.
	   In a letter dated Friday, the Barbados Cricket Association urged
the WICB and players to reach a compromise and said Lara and Hooper
should be reinstated.
	   Barbadian legislator Clyde Mascoll was more forceful and said
``the board should be fired.''
	   In Port-of-Spain, the Trinidadian capital, Lara's fans set up a
massive blackboard in the heart of the city at Woodford Square and
dozens signed it to show ``100 percent support for Lara and his
men.''
	   The crisis is being compared to the one in 1978 when West Indies
players snubbed the national team and contracted with Australian
magnate Kerry Packer's World Series of Cricket.
	   Lara, the batting superstar of the sport, set a world record of
375 runs in a 1994 Test against England. A few weeks later, he
scored a first-class record of 501 for his English county side
Warwickshire.

Saudi minister: Arabs want no harm to Iraqi civilians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal
on Sunday cautioned against any U.S. use of force against Iraq
saying that civilians could be harmed.
	   Prince Saud al-Faisal spoke shortly before meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak to discuss the crisis with Iraq.
	   ``The Arab countries harbor love for the Iraqi people,'' Prince
Saud told reporters after his arrival.
	   Last week, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen visited Saudi
Arabia and was told that the kingdom would not allow its territory
to be used for strikes against Iraq.
	   On Friday, Cohen returned from a tour of Arab nations and
Turkey, saying he was satisfied the United States would have
adequate support from Arab nations for any action against Iraq.
	   Iraq has cut off all cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors
and the United States and Britain have not ruled out using force to
back up their demand that the arms monitors are allowed to resume
work.
	   The inspectors are responsible for overseeing the elimination of
Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction, a process Baghdad must
complete before U.N. economic sanctions imposed after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait can be lifted.
	   Prince Saud was also in Cairo to work to improve
Iranian-Egyptian relations.
	   After meeting Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi in Riyadh
Saturday, Prince Saud expressed hope that Iran and Egypt would
upgrade relations. The two states severed ties after Iran's 1979
Islamic Revolution.
	   ``There are no obstacles to high-level relations between the two
sides,'' he said.

China unveils 33-meter statue of Taoist founder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAOSHAN, China (AP) _ In rites attended by followers of Taoism
from Chinese communities abroad, officials have unveiled a
33-meter-high (110-foot-high) statue of Lao-tze, the sage who
founded the faith 2,500 years ago.
	   Musicians played horns and wooden blocks while priests performed
a ritual known as ``opening the light'' to christen the 100-ton
copper statue Friday in Maoshan, a town near the eastern Chinese
city of Nanjing.
	   Taoism, the oldest indigenous Chinese religion, is based on
Lao-tze's book the ``Dao De Jing,'' which urges followers to live
in harmony with nature and revere their ancestors.
	   Communist Chinese leaders have allowed Taoism to flourish in
recent years, after suppressing it for decades. Temples were closed
and, during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, many were destroyed.
	   Today, Taoism has several million followers in China, with
25,000 priests and nuns and 1,500 temples, mostly in eastern China.
	   Taoism also has a large following in Chinese communities abroad.
The unveiling of the Lao-tze statue was attended by delegations
from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore.
	   ``All religions are trying hard to educate their young and
advertise their own theories. For the Taoist people, we should also
positively do the same so that young people can embrace this
religion,'' said Weng Taiming, mistress of the Kaohsiung Taoist
House in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.
	   The 7 million yuan (dlrs 840,000) statue in Maoshan, the biggest
depiction of Lao-tze in China, was paid for by donations from
abroad and the official Chinese Taoist Association.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Thongchai Jaidee and Rangsan
Ruengtham both shot even-par 72s Sunday as Thailand wrapped up a
15-stroke victory in the Putra Cup, its sixth triumph in 13 years
in the amateur teams tournament.
	   Thailand finished the four-day tournament with a total of 876.
The Philippines, hurt by a bad start, finished second at 891, with

	   ``Our players came here to play their final tune-up before the
Asian Games,'' Thai team manager Methee Sudasna said, referring to
the regional games next month in Bangkok.
	   Thongchai celebrated his 29th birthday Sunday by taking top
individual honors with an even-par 288.
	   ``I feel great. Winning the individual title is very memorable
for me,'' the Thai army soldier said through an interpreter.
	   Rangsan, a 26-year-old soldier, placed second in individual
scoring with 292.
	   Gerald Rosales led the Philippine team with a total of 296, good
for fifth among individuals.
	   Malaysia placed fourth with 908, followed by Indonesia with 910,

Kobayashi wins penultimate U.S. LPGA event
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANNO, Japan (AP) _ Hiromi Kobayashi birdied the third extra
hole in a playoff Sunday against American Tina Barrett and won the
Japan Classic, the season's next to last event on the U.S. LPGA
Tour.
	   Kobayashi, a regular on the U.S. tour, needed birdies on three
of the last four holes to force the playoff with Barrett, who
already had finished at 11-under-par 205 for the regulation 54
holes after a 6-under 66 Sunday.
	   Kobayashi shot a 69 Sunday en route to her second victory this
year and fourth overall on the U.S. tour. The title was worth dlrs
120,000 from a purse of dlrs 800,000.
	   ``When I dropped a stroke to 7-under on the 11th hole, I thought
it would be challenging for me to win,'' said the 35-year-old
Kobayashi.
	   ``I was able to regain the rhythm, and confidence, with the
birdie on the 14th,'' she said.
	   On the par-5 16th, she chipped in for a birdie from the edge of
the green, and then she birdied the final two holes.
	   Both Kobayashi and Barrett parred the first two playoff holes.
On the third, Barrett three-putted for a bogey from 13 feet (4
meters), while Kobayashi sank a 3-foot (1-meter) birdie putt.
	   As a star player on the Japan LPGA Tour, Kobayashi also has won
nine Japanese tournaments in 13 years as a pro. She joined the U.S.
tour in 1990, and won two U.S. LPGA tournaments in 1993.
	   Following a long drought, Kobayashi won the Rainbow Foods LPGA
Classic in August, also in a playoff.
	   ``I did my best,'' said Barrett, who was seeking her first title
since winning the Mitsubishi Motors Ocean State Open in 1989. ``But
Hiromi played better in the playoff.''
	   Overnight leader Lorie Kane of Canada turned in a 73 and was
alone in third place at 207.
	   LPGA Hall of Famer Betsy King shot a 70 and shared fourth with
Helen Alfredsson and Taiwan's Huang Yu-chen. Alfredsson shot a 71
and Huang a 74.
	   Annika Sorenstam, who leads the points race for U.S. LPGA Player
of the Year and is on top of the money earnings list, skipped this
tournament.
	   So did South Korean rookie sensation Se Ri Pak, who has already
clinched 1998 Rolex Rookie of the Year honors. She was forced to
withdraw due to illness and fatigue.
	   After receiving South Korea's second highest sports medal from
President Kim Dae-jung on Friday, Pak left Seoul for the United
States Saturday to prepare for the Tour Championship tournament.

Saudi minister: Arabs want no harm to Iraqi civilians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Saudi foreign minister saying Iraq to blame for
crisis.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal
on Sunday cautioned against a possible U.S. use of force against
Iraq, saying that civilians could be harmed.
	   But he also said that Iraq was responsible for the current
crisis and urged Baghdad to rescind its decision to end cooperation
with U.N. arms monitors.
	   The United States and Britain have not ruled out using force to
back up their demand that the weapons inspectors are allowed to
resume their work.
	   Egypt and Saudi Arabia ``are keen to see that the Iraqi people
are not harmed,'' Prince Saud al-Faisal said after meeting with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. ``But the responsibility for this
issue is entirely that of the Iraqi leadership.''
	   ``We are dismayed that the work with the (U.N.) commission was
stopped,'' he said. He called on Iraq to ``rescind its decision.''
	   Asked if Saudi Arabia would support a U.S. strike against Iraq,
Prince Saud said: ``There is no doubt we prefer a peaceful
solution. Is there anyone who wants harm done to the Iraqi people?'
	   Last week, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen visited Saudi
Arabia and was told that the kingdom would not allow its territory
to be used for strikes against Iraq.
	   On Friday, Cohen returned from a tour of Arab nations and
Turkey, saying he was satisfied the United States would have
adequate support from Arab nations for any action against Iraq.
	   U.N. weapons inspectors are responsible for overseeing the
elimination of Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction, a process
Baghdad must complete before U.N. economic sanctions imposed after
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait can be lifted.
	   Prince Saud was also in Cairo to work to improve
Iranian-Egyptian relations.
	   After meeting Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi in Riyadh
Saturday, Prince Saud expressed hope that Iran and Egypt would
upgrade relations. The two states severed ties after Iran's 1979
Islamic Revolution.
	   ``There are no obstacles to high-level relations between the two
sides,'' he said.

Latest dispute over accord's provisions centers on radical groups
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Setting the stage for a new quarrel over how to
crack down on militants, Israel is demanding that the military
wings of two radical Islamic groups be outlawed, while the
Palestinian Authority insists it has already banned them.
	   Implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security
accord, signed Oct. 23 in Washington, was to have begun this past
week, but has hit various snags.
	   Most recently, Israel's Cabinet put off a vote to ratify the
accord after a suicide bombing Friday in Jerusalem that killed the
two assailants and injured 21 Israelis. The radical group Islamic
Jihad claimed responsibility.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said Sunday that Israel expects Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to formally outlaw the military wings of Islamic
Jihad and the larger militant group Hamas.
	   Hassan Asfour, a senior Palestinian official, said Hamas'
military wing, Izeddine al Qassam, and the military wing of Islamic
Jihad were outlawed by the Palestinian Authority in 1996. But
Bar-Illan said the Palestinian legislature had never passed such a
law.
	   ``Why did Mr. Arafat agree in the Wye accord to outlaw them if
he has already done it?'' he asked.
	   The Wye memorandum states that the Palestinian Authority ``will
inform the United States fully of the actions it has taken to
outlaw all organizations (or wings of organizations, as
appropriate) of a military, terrorist or violent character, and
their support structure and to prevent them freedom of action in
the areas under its jurisdiction.''
	   A Palestinian security official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a joint Israeli-Palestinian meeting was held
Saturday night to discuss security in the wake of Friday's attack.
	   Participants included the head of the Palestinian intelligence,
Amin Hindi, and the head of preventive security in the Gaza Strip,
Mohammed Dahlan.
	   The idea of outlawing Hamas and Islamic Jihad was brought up in
the meeting and also proposed by Netanyahu to Arafat during a phone
call, the official said.
	   The Palestinians said they could ban activity by Hamas or
Islamic Jihad that endangered either Israelis or Palestinians, but
could not outlaw them outright as political movements.
	   Friday's bombing led to finger-pointing by both sides. Israel
said it showed Arafat's crackdown on terrorists had not been
sweeping enough.
	   The Palestinians, however, have also accused Israel of failing
to take at least partial security responsibility for the attack,
because both attackers came from Israeli-controlled areas, and had
recently served time in Israeli jails.
	   Israel as a rule is harshly critical of the Palestinian
Authority's security efforts when attackers come from
Palestinian-controlled areas or have been released from Palestinian
prisons.
	   On Sunday, Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu-Medein accused
Netanyahu of using the blast as a pretext for delaying
implementation of the peace accord.
	   ``This attack is a gift to Mr. Netanyahu,'' Abu-Medein said.
``All the time he is praying to God to help him ... to escape from
the agreement.''
	   Under the accord, Israel is to hand over another 13 percent of
the territory in the West Bank to the Palestinians in exchange for
various security steps.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai predicted Sunday that
the Israeli Cabinet would ratify the agreement in coming days. ``I
estimate that the government will meet this week and will accept
the decision of the majority (in favor of the agreement),'' he
said.

Germany seeks jobless benefits for prostitutes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German prostitutes should get a legal right
to jobless, health and retirement benefits, the new government's
minister for women was quoted as saying.
	   ``We have a draft law, we only need to introduce it in
parliament,'' Christine Bergmann told the newsweekly Der Spiegel in
its new edition published Sunday.
	   Under German law, prostitutes are required to pay taxes but
can't claim the social welfare state's generous benefits.
	   Prostitutes should also get the right to sue customers who don't
pay, Bergmann told the magazine.
	   A Social Democrat like Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, Bergmann is
promoting a more liberal line on women's rights and family issues
than the previous center-right government under Helmut Kohl.
	   She called for a ban on pornography that shows violent or
``sexually demeaning'' acts against women and children.
	   ``I consider it an important signal that society says: We won't
tolerate this,'' she told Der Spiegel.

Strained Malaysia-Singapore ties can return to normal, official
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The strained ties between Malaysia
and Singapore can return to normal following last week's meeting
between their prime ministers, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah
Badawi was quoted as saying Sunday.
	   Abdullah said the two leaders, who met Thursday at Kuala
Lumpur's international airport, reached an understanding on several
issues that had caused tensions between the two neighbors.
	   ``The meeting will pave the way for improved bilateral
relations,'' the national news agency Bernama quoted Abdullah as
telling reporters in Johore Baharu, 360 kilometers (216 miles)
south of the capital.
	   After Thursday's meeting, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad said he and Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong agreed
that their officials would curb the heated attacks on each other.
	   Singapore also agreed to cooperate in finding ways to raise
funds for Malaysia, while Malaysia promised to help meet
Singapore's water requirements, one of the issues that had caused
tensions. Singapore now obtains most of its water from Malaysia.
	   More recent problems in relations included arguments over the
location of a border post and the cancellation of automatic flyover
rights for Singaporean military aircraft using Malaysian airspace.
	   Thursday's was the first top-level meeting between the two
countries since relations, testy even before the added pressure of
the Asian financial crisis, started to deteriorate rapidly earlier
this year. The two leaders last had met in April.
	   Bernama said Abdullah also referred to a call by Philippine
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado for a stronger U.S. presence in
his country due to the conflicting claims between China and the
Philippines over areas in the Spratly Islands in the South China
Sea.
	   Abdullah said the United States and the Philippines had close
ties, but cooperation between members of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations was crucial for the security and stability
of the region.
	   The ASEAN members are Singapore, the Philippines, Malaysia,
Brunei, Laos, Thailand, Myanmar, Indonesia and Vietnam.
	   Abdullah said ASEAN countries had reached an understanding not
to resort to any action that could create tension in the region,
such as the use of military force to settle the overlapping claims
for the Spratlys.
	   ``Instead, ASEAN preferred to resolve issues among themselves
through peaceful negotiations,'' he said.

Saudi minister: Arabs want no harm to Iraqi civilians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal
on Sunday cautioned against a possible U.S. use of force against
Iraq, saying that civilians could be harmed.
	   But he also said that Iraq was responsible for the current
crisis and urged Baghdad to rescind its decision to end cooperation
with U.N. arms monitors.
	   The United States and Britain have not ruled out using force to
back up their demand that the weapons inspectors are allowed to
resume their work.
	   Egypt and Saudi Arabia ``are keen to see that the Iraqi people
are not harmed,'' Prince Saud al-Faisal said after meeting with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. ``But the responsibility for this
issue is entirely that of the Iraqi leadership.''
	   ``We are dismayed that the work with the (U.N.) commission was
stopped,'' he said. He called on Iraq to ``rescind its decision.''
	   Asked if Saudi Arabia would support a U.S. strike against Iraq,
Prince Saud said: ``There is no doubt we prefer a peaceful
solution. Is there anyone who wants harm done to the Iraqi people?'
	   Last week, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen visited Saudi
Arabia and was told that the kingdom would not allow its territory
to be used for strikes against Iraq.

Reports: Turkey sends troops into northern Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey has sent into northern Iraq some
25,000 troops, backed by war planes and helicopters, to fight
Turkish Kurdish rebels, according to news reports Sunday.
	   Military authorities in Ankara would neither confirm nor deny
the reports.
	   In Brussels, Mizgin Sen, a spokeswoman for a Kurdish
organization that includes members of the rebel Kurdistan Worker's
Party (PKK) said that a Turkish military operation was underway to
secure the border before winter settles in.
	   Turkey recently stepped up its battle to end the 14-year-old war
by autonomy-seeking rebels.
	   The Turkish daily Hurriyet said the latest operation against
rebel hideouts began Thursday, with troops pushing some 30
kilometers (19 miles) inside Iraq.
	   Turkish troops have staged several such operations in northern
Iraq, which the PKK uses as a base to wage cross-border attacks on
Turkey.,
	   The operation was reportedly prompted by the recent entry into
northern Iraq of some 400 rebels from Syria. Turkey pressured Syria
last month into ending its alleged support to the rebels.
	   On Sunday, the leaders of the two Iraqi Kurdish factions that
control northern Iraq met in Ankara to discuss a recent peace
agreement signed between the two groups in Washington.
	   After years of fighting for the control of the region, Massoud
Barzani of the Kurdistan Democratic Party and Jalal Talabani of the
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan agreed in September to share power in
northern Iraq and hold elections next year.
	   Turkey is strongly opposed to any move aiming at the creation of
an independent Kurdish state, which could inspire the PKK in its
battle for autonomy in Turkey.
	   ``The two leaders discussed the strengthening of our relations
with Turkey and working together for peace and stability in the
region,'' Hoshiyar Zebari of the Democratic Party said.
	   In a move to appease Turkey, both Iraqi Kurdish groups agreed in
Washington to join in Ankara's battle against the PKK. Barzani's
forces were reportedly fighting along the Turkish army in
Thursday's operation.

Yokoo wins first career title in Acom International
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IWAKI, Japan (AP) _ Kaname Yokoo collected 10 points Sunday for
six birdies against two bogeys and won his first career victory by
three points in the 120 million yen (dlrs 1.02 million) Acom
International golf tournament.
	   Yokoo, in his fourth year on the tour, finished the 72 holes
with a total of 46 points, three ahead of Katsumasa Miyamoto.
	   ``I tried to score as many birdies as I can because the point
system makes a birdie more than enough to offset a bogey,'' said
the 26-year-old Yokoo.
	   The tournament's modified Stableford scoring system awards 8
points for a double eagle, 5 for an eagle, 2 for a birdie, zero for
par, minus-1 for a bogey and minus-3 for a double bogey or worse.
	   Yokoo, winner of the 1993 national collegiate championship, was
the leader throughout the four-day event.
	   He earned 21.6 million yen (dlrs 180,000), his biggest paycheck
so far.
	   Kimpachi Yoshimura and Taisuke Kitajima were tied for third at
36 points.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A trial delayed 23 years by
Bangladesh's bitter and bloody politics culminated on Sunday with a
judge convicting and ordering death for 15 former military
commanders in the 1975 assassination of the country's first prime
minister.
	   Four others, including a former junior minister for information,
were acquitted in the killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, father of
current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, because there wasn't enough
evidence against them. After taking office in 1996, Hasina used her
power to bring her father's killers to trial, saying ensuring
justice would help entrench democracy in this volatile country.
	   Thousands of followers of Sheikh Mujib, as he is popularly known
in Bangladesh, danced in the streets outside the courtroom to
celebrate the verdict by Dhaka District Judge Kazi Golam Rasul.
Shouts of ``justice has prevailed!'' rang out.
	   Rasul ordered the sentences carried out in public by firing
squad, a departure from the normal practice of death by hanging. He
said this would be a lesson to the army which had failed in its
duty to protect the leader of the nation.
	   The convicted men said they would appeal the sentence in a
higher court.
	   Rahman, who led the country's independence war against Pakistan
in 1971, was gunned down by rebellious soldiers at his Dhaka
residence on Aug. 15 in 1975. Most of his family was also killed
that day; two daughters survived because they were out of the
country on holiday.
	   Months earlier, Rahman had instituted one-party rule and gave
himself more powers. His critics had accused him of authoritarian
rule and corruption, but his daughter says he was trying to ensure
order and would have restored democracy if he had been given time.
	   Rahman's killers granted themselves amnesties, and in the
ensuing political turmoil no one ever moved to bring them to trial
until Hasina came to power.
	   In its 27 years of history Bangladesh has witnessed the
assassination of two heads of government _ the first was Rahman;
three military coups; and 19 failed coup attempts. Sunday's verdict
ended the country's first trial of coup leaders in a civil court.
Military tribunals were set up to try the leaders of other coups.
	   After 149 days of hearings, the verdict was handed down to
retired army officers Syed Farooq Rahman, Sultan Shahriyar Rashid
Khan, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Khandaker Abdur Rashid, Aziz Pasha, Shariful
Haq Dalim, Bazlul Huda, Noor Chowdhury, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Rashed
Chowdhury, Ahmed Shariful Hasan, Kishmat Hashem, Abdul Majed,
Nazmul Ansar and Moslemuddin Ahmed.
	   The judge found Taheruddin Thakur, Abdul Wahab Joardar, Marfat
Ali Shah and Hashem Mridha not guilty.
	   Only five of the accused _ Syed Farooq Rahman, Khan, Ahmed,
Wahab and former junior Information Minister Thakur _ were in court
to hear the 90-minute verdict. The government is trying to track
down the others, all believed to have fled Bangladesh.
	   Fearing the verdict would spark violence, authorities had
deployed more than 10,000 security forces in Dhaka, the capital
city of 9 million.
	   Political violence, which is common in Bangladesh, escalated on
the eve of the verdict on Saturday when clashes between opposition
activists and supporters of Hasina killed one person in Dhaka.
	   The government accused the opposition of trying to derail the
trial. Opposition leader Khaleda Zia denied the charge, accused
Hasina's government of incompetence and corruption, and called for
a nationwide general strike Monday and Tuesday.

Government smashes syndicate smuggling Chinese to Canada
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The government said Sunday it has arrested
eight people, including two Taiwanese, and smashed an international
syndicate that was smuggling mainland Chinese to Canada via Japan.
	   The territory's Independent Commission Against Corruption said
the syndicate, which also forged passports, operated in Hong Kong
with the assistance of some corrupt airline employees who switched
boarding passes to help the smuggled people on their journeys.
	   Among those arrested Saturday were three Hong Kong Chinese and
three mainland Chinese who had arrived in the territory as
visitors, it said.
	   Commission officers detained one of the Taiwanese at Hong Kong's
Chek Lap Kok airport as he was escorting a Chinese to board a
plane, the commission said.
	   The Chinese visitor was believed to have had her boarding pass
for a flight to the Chinese city of Shanghai exchanged for one for
a flight to Japan, it added in a statement said.
	   It said the syndicate was believed to be charging each
Canada-bound Chinese U.S. dlrs 26,000 in the smuggling operation.

French territory casts ballots in referendum toward independence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with ``yes'' vote holding solid lead in
partial results; high participation &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTIAN TORTEL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) _ New Caledonians, turning out in
greater numbers than expected, voted a solid ``yes'' in a Sunday
referendum that could lead to independence in two decades for this
French Pacific territory, partial results show.
	   ``This is a beautiful success and an encouraging sign for the
future,'' France's acting interior minister, Jean-Jacques
Queyranne, said in Paris, where results of the referendum were
being made public.
	   With 23 of the 33 regions counted, the ``yes'' vote held the
lead at 76 percent, said the minister, who is replacing ailing
Interior Minister Jean-Louis Chevenement.
	   The results were likely to be softened -- but not drastically
modified -- when the count comes in from the New Caledonian capital
of Noumea.
	   The participation rate stood at 77 percent despite fears that
apathy would prevail among the 107,000 people registered to take
part in the referendum aimed at putting to rest decades of division
on the archipelago that led to riots and bloodshed in the 1980s.
	   New Caledonians were asked to decide whether to accept a
transition period of ``shared sovereignty'' for the archipelago
that is 20,000 kilometers (12,430 miles) from France.
	   If they agree to that, a new referendum will be held in 15-20
years to decide on total independence after 150 years as a French
Overseas Territory.
	   But apathy was the chief concern of the two sides -- the Rally
for Caledonia in the Republic -- the RPCR -- and the Kanak and
Socialist National Liberation Front -- the FLNKS, which led the
bloody struggle in the 1980s for independence.
	   New Caledonians cast their ballots amid mounting social tension,
due in part to the plummeting price of nickel -- the main resource
in New Caledonia, which has an estimated 30 percent of the world's
nickel reserve.
	   Angry dockers last week blocked the Noumea port to press demands
for improved indemnities as part of a plan to let go workers.
Workers from an adversary union countered, threatening a general
strike if access to the port was not assured.
	   Elsewhere, small-time miners, threatened by large mining groups
and diminishing incomes, blocked the main island road to press for
guarantees that would assure their survival.
	   Residents 18 and older were asked if they approve the Noumea
Accord signed May 5 providing for the transition period toward
independence.
	   The accord, concluded between Paris, the FLNKS and the RPCR,
followed a decade of violence in the Pacific island marked by
fierce riots and political killings in the 1980s that stunned the
French and galvanized the search for a peaceful solution.
	   The accord provides for a large transfer of powers from Paris to
Noumea during a transition period.
	   New Caledonia is about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) east of
Australia. Nearly half of the archipelago's population are native
Kanaks or Melanesians, and about one-third are of European origin.
The rest are from other parts of Polynesia.

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ The emir of Bahrain, Sheik Isa bin Salman
Al Khalifa, has undergone a medical checkup in the United States
and is in good health, newspapers reported Sunday.
	   The newspapers, quoting a statement from the Emiri Court, did
not mention when or exactly where Sheik Isa had his checkup. But
they said the tests were successful.
	   Bahraini newspapers reported the emir's departure last Monday on
a private visit abroad but did not mention where he was headed.
	   Sheik Isa had a heart attack in the months following Iraq's
August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. He was treated in Cleveland, Ohio.
	   Sheik Isa, 65, has been ruling Bahrain since 1961. Bahrain, the
Middle East's main banking center, also serves as a base for the
U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet.

Pope deplores Jerusalem attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Sunday deplored the
Jerusalem bombing, saying such violence was frustrating the efforts
of those who yearn for peace.
	   After Friday's attack, which killed the two bombers and injured
21 people, the Israeli Cabinet, postponed ratification of the
latest Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
	   Such violence, the pope told several thousand faithful gathered
in St. Peter's Square for his weekly appearance from his studio
window, risks ``frustrating the efforts of those who year for a
better world.''
	   The pope said ``another attack in the center of Jerusalem has
awakened new fears for peace, just when hopes were reborn for the
resumption of talks after the recent accord between both sides that
was the fruit of arduous and courageous negotiating.''
	   Progress in the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians
could open the way to a visit the pope has often said he wanted to
make to the Holy Land.
	   The pope made no mention of the status of Jerusalem, a thorn in
Vatican-Israeli relations. A Vatican official last week said east
Jerusalem was ``illegally occupied'' by the Israelis and asked for
international guarantees for sites considered holy by Christians,
Jews and Muslims.
	   Israel considers as its eternal capital all of Jerusalem,
including the traditionally Arab east that it took over in the 1967
war.

Israel mum on pair arrested in Cyprus as spy suspects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel was officially silent Sunday on the
subject of two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of spying,
but a government official said Israeli diplomats would likely visit
them in prison.
	   Israeli foreign ministry spokeman Effii Ben-Matityahu had no
comment on the arrests other than to note that officials from the
Israeli consulate were expected to go to the Nicosia prison where
the two were being held.
	   Cypriot police said the two would be brought before a remand
hearing Nov. 16.
	   In Israel, some former officials and analysts expressed doubts
that the two _ arrested Saturday in the community of Ziyi near the
southern coastal resort of Larnaca for allegedly spying on a nearby
army base _ were working for the Mossad secret service.
	   A Cypriot police source said the Israelis were suspected of
spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern
third of Cyprus in 1974.
	   Turkey has significantly increased military cooperation with
Israel in the past two years. Israeli military analyst Ron Ben
Yishai, writing in the Yediot Ahronoth newspaper, suggested the
arrests were meant as a warning to Israel not to cooperate with
Turkey in any spy operation.
	   Some Israeli press reports speculated about whether the pair's
presence had anything to do with Cyprus' recent purchase of S-300
anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.
	   Cyprus fears Israel is training Turkish pilots on how to bomb
the missile batteries once they are installed. Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides reaffirmed Saturday that his government would go
ahead and deploy the anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Senior intelligence sources told the Maariv newspaper that the
Mossad would not take such risks to gather intelligence on Turkey's
behalf. Israeli military commentator Oded Granot wrote in Maariv
newspaper that the two might have been caught in a training
exercise that went wrong.
	   Rafi Eitan, a former Mossad operator, said methods and devices
used by the two were not typical of the Mossad. He speculated that
the two might have been hired by a private Turkish outfit.
	   Cypriot police officials said Saturday they found cameras,
wireless instruments, tapes of conversations between police, radio
scanners and maps in the apartment the two were renting.
	   Relations between Cyprus and Israel have chilled in recent
months as Israel conducted joint military maneuvers with Turkey as
part of their 1996 defense pact. Israel has repeatedly insisted
that its ties with Turkey are not directed against any other
countries in the region.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman had almost succeeded in patching
up relations with Cyprus with a three-day visit to the island last
week.
	   During the 1970s and 1980s, Cyprus was widely used as a regional
listening post by intelligence agents from various regional powers.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Fifteen former military commanders were

country's first prime minister. Four others, including a former

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Setting the stage for a new quarrel over how to
crack down on militants, Israel is demanding that the military
wings of two radical Islamic groups be outlawed, while the
Palestinian Authority insists it has already banned them.
Implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security accord,
signed Oct. 23 in Washington, was to have begun this past week, but
has hit various snags. David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said Sunday that Israel expects
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to formally outlaw the military
wings of Islamic Jihad and the larger militant group Hamas.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ A dissident based in the central Chinese city of
Changsha has begun 10 days in police detention for attempting to
set up an independent political group, a human rights group said
Sunday. Xie Changfa was taken from his home Saturday, a day after
he had applied to a Civil Affairs office for permission to set up
an organization called the ``China Association to Protect Citizens'
Rights and Interests,'' the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said. The Hong Kong-based group said
police had advised Xie's family that he would be held for 10 days
for violating regulations on social order. Xie, formerly an
engineer at the Changsha Steel Works, spent two years in a labor
camp for his involvement in 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Five months ago, the military shot
four student protesters to death, triggering massive riots that
killed about 1,200 people. Much of Jakarta was set ablaze, students
occupied the Parliament, and authoritarian President Suharto was
forced to resign after 32 years in power. Now, the capital of 11
million people is bracing for more turmoil as it prepares for
another major turning point. The Southeast Asian nation's highest
legislative body meets Tuesday to debate how to reform the tightly
controlled political system that kept Suharto in office for so
long. (INDONESIA-DEMOCRACY)

Australia beats Pakistan to clinch one-day series

<TEXT>
	   PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) _ Australia clinched the three-match
series after defeating Pakistan by five wickets in the second
one-day International in Peshawar on Sunday.
	   ``We will like to make it 3-0,'' said Steve Waugh, who will meet
Pakistan in the final game of the series in Lahore on Tuesday.
	   Australia, facing a modest 218-run victory target, romped home
with 11 deliveries to spare with Michael Bevan, who recorded his
second successive half century, remained undefeated on 57.
	   Off-spinner Saqlain Mushtaq gave Pakistan hope when he took
three quick wickets after Australian openers Adam Gilchrist (42)
and Mark Waugh (19) put on 63 runs for the first wicket.
	   Mushtaq grabbed a splendid diving return catch to dismiss
Gilchrist and then had Waugh brothers Mark clean bowled and Steve
trapped leg before for nought as Australia slumped to 71 for three.
	   However, a fifth wicket stand of 82 between Ricky Ponting (55
off 70 balls) paved the way for Australia's victory before Darren
Lehmann made a brisk 26 off 24 balls to seal the match together
with Bevan, who hit three fours in his undefeated 57.
	   Earlier, Azhar Mahmood's career-best unbeaten 65 helped Pakistan
cross the 200 mark after left-arm medium fast Brendon Julian's
three-wicket burst saw the home team crawl to 59 for five in the
21st over.
	   Wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist dropped both Pakistan captain Aamir
Sohail and Ijaz Ahmed off Aussie attack bowlers Glenn McGrath and
Damien Fleming respectively. Darren Lehmann left the field after he
slammed into the field trying to catch Sohail at mid on.
	   The doctor checked Lehmann, who hit his head but was not
seriously hurt.
	   Julian removed Sohail off his first delivery in the 11th over
when the batsman got a leading edge and was caught by Ricky Ponting
at point.
	   Debutante Asif Mehmood (14), one of the four changes made by
Pakistan after the first one-day loss by 86 runs, gave Mark Waugh
an easy catch in the first slip off Damien Fleming.
	   Julian then took out Ahmed and later Salim Malik, who was caught
spectacularly by a diving Brad Young at gully.
	   Yousaf Youhanna, who made 92 during the first one dayer in
Karachi, was out for a duck after a mix-up with Malik. Mahmood and
Moin Khan then put on 78 runs for the sixth wicket, but Australia
kept the run-rate in check.
	   After Khan was out leg before to left-arm spinner Young, Wasim
Akram and Mahmood accelerated the run-rate and Pakistan scored a
rapid 76 runs in the last nine overs.
	   Akram made a quick 34 off 32 balls, while Mahmood remained
unbeaten on 65 off 90 deliveries, which featured five fours.
	   Julian claimed three wickets for 40 off his 10 overs while
McGrath, who took Akram's wicket in his second spell, ended up with
one of 34.

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Holland beat Pakistan 3-1 to capture the
gold in the 20th Champions Trophy men's field hockey tournament on
Sunday.
	   With this win, Holland now holds three top world field hockey
titles _ World Cup, Olympics and Champions Trophy. Holland won the
1996 Atlanta Olympics title and earlier this year won the World cup
at Utrecht, Holland.
	   Holland defenders Erik Jazet and Peter Windi played a strong
game to keep Pakistan to a single goal.
	   ``We played with a set plan and kept the Pakistan forwards in
check,'' said Dutch skipper Ronald Janssen. ``It's a big day not
just for me but for my country also. No one has ever won the three
titles in a row. Obviously it's a big achievement.''
	   Pakistan forwards Atif Bashir, Mohammad Sarwar and Haider
Hussain were strongly checked by the Netherlands. Pakistan suffered
a serious blow when Bashir was sent off in the second half for a
foul on a Dutch defender.
	   Bashir brought the home crowd of 35,000 to their feet when he
opened the scoring in the 12th minute off a penalty corner rebound.
Sohail Abbas' attempt was stopped by Janssen, but Bashir pounced on
the rebound and flicked the ball home.
	   However, Bram Lomans, Dutch penalty corner specialist, tied the
score with a powerful push off his team's 21st minute short corner.
Remco van Wijk ran down the right flank in the 32nd minute and gave
a timely pass back to Piet Hein Geeris, who neatly placed the ball
in Pakistan's empty net.
	   Marten Eikelboom confirmed his team's victory with a strong
deflection off 68th minute short corner.
	   ``We were beaten by a better team,'' said Pakistan captain
Mohammad Usman. ``Our forwards failed to make combined moves and
our defense was not as good as it was against the Dutchmen in the
previous match.''
	   Atif Bashir was declared best player of the tournament while the
trophy for fair play went to South Korea, which lost the bronze
medal to Australia earlier in the day.
	   Result: Holland 3 (Bram Lomans (21st min), Piet Hein Geeris
(32nd min), Marten Eikelboom (68th min); Pakistan 1 (12th min).
	   Holland: Bram Lomans, Danny Bree, Erik Jazet, Peter Windi,
Sander van der Weide, Jacques Brinkman, Piet Hein Geeris, Marten
Eikelboom, Sander van Heeswijk, Jeroen Delmee, Ronald Janssen
(captain), Remco van Wijk, Jaap Derk Buma.
	   Pakistan: Mohammad Usman (captain), Aamir Saleem, Babar
Abdullah, Sohail Abbas, Ali Raza, Imran Yousuf, Waseem Ahmed,
Haider Hussain, Muhammad Sarwar, Kamran Ashraf, Naveed Iqbal, Anis
Ahmed, Muhammad Qasim, Asad Ali Qureshi, Atif Bashir.

British stockholders block LucasVarity move to New York
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In a sharp rebuff to American executives, British
shareholders in LucasVarity PLC have blocked an attempt to move the
headquarters of the big auto components and aerospace company from
Britain to the United States.
	   Shareholders owning 73.9 percent of the group's share capital
voted in favor, but that fell just short of the 75 percent required
under company rules, the LucasVarity announced Saturday.
	   The Anglo-American giant's U.S.-dominated executive board had
wanted to move the headquarters to Buffalo, New York, abandoning
its listing on London's Financial Times index of 100 top shares for
a New York listing.
	   ``We would like to thank the large majority of shareholders who
supported the proposal,'' LucasVarity chairman Ed Wallis said in a
terse statement on the vote, taken Friday night.
	   ``It's business as usual,'' Wallis added.
	   However, the dispute had been colored by British-American
rivalry _ a feature of the group since the 1996 merger of
100-year-old Lucas Industries PLC, based in the Birmingham, central
England, and Buffalo-based Varity Corp. into a group valued at more
than dlrs 5 billion.
	   Many analysts considered the vote left the group in an
uncomfortable situation.
	   ``It is great that shareholders have this power still,'' said
Jim Wood-Smith, head of research at London stockbrokers Greig
Middleton.
	   ``But what will LucasVarity do from here? The shareholders have
effectively given the new board a vote of no confidence and the
board has done the same to the shareholders. It's an unhappy
situation all round.''
	   The company said there would be no management changes.
	   But a London weekly, Sunday Business, said the vote ``raised
questions'' over the future of chief executive Victor Rice, who
proposed the transfer.
	   Although British-born, Rice normally lives in Buffalo and has
spent most of his career in the United States.
	   Rice had argued that a New York listing would give better access
to investment capital for the company to expand in the United
States.
	   Many British investors were miffed that no mention of moving
headquarters was made at the time of the merger, and also reluctant
in principle to see the company, which makes brake parts for a big
range of cars, no longer British-based.
	   Many small investors also hold stock in Personal Equity Plans,
which give tax-breaks under British laws. Foreign shares are not
permitted under the tax rules.
	   Some of the 18,000 small shareholders also suspected that
company executives wanted to get back to the United States.
	   Sunday Business said the balance was tipped against Rice when
British corporate stockholders, Schroders, an investment house with
11 percent of the stock, and Legal and General, an insurance group,
voted against the move.

Philippines plans to relocate 850,000 slum families in six years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government plans to
relocate about 850,000 families from shantytowns into government
housing projects in six years, an official said Sunday.
	   Within two years, President Joseph Estrada wants officials to
relocate 450,000 of those families, mostly people living along
Manila's filthy drainage canals, said Karina David, chief of the
government's Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council.
	   Squatters on public and private land account for nearly
one-third of the more than 8 million people in metropolitan Manila.
The proportion is likely to climb to half the metropolis'
population by the year 2000 as poor people continue to pour in from
the countryside, according to a study.
	   Past government efforts to solve the problem of squatting have
had little impact.
	   David said the president has ordered the government's fund for
mass housing to be used to build houses that would cost about
180,000 pesos (dlrs 4,500) each, an amount that could be paid in
installments by slum dwellers.
	   Estrada overwhelmingly won election in May on a platform
centered on promises to devote his six-year term to easing the
plight of millions of poor Filipinos.

French territory votes ``yes'' in referendum toward independence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with final results, comment from French president;
EDITS to reflect results &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTIAN TORTEL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) _ New Caledonians turned out in force
Sunday to ratify a referendum on ``shared sovereignty'' that could
lead to independence in two decades for this French Pacific
territory.
	   The ``yes'' vote for a transition period giving broad new powers
to this territory 20,000 kilometers (12,430 miles) from Paris
totaled 71.8 percent of the ballots cast, according to the Ministry
for Overseas Territories in Paris.
	   The participation rate was 74 percent of the 107,000 people
registered to take part in the referendum, the ministry said.
	   President Jacques Chirac expressed ``delight that Caledonians
have made the choice of consensus and responsibility in preparing
their future,'' the president's office said.
	   Chirac said he now counted on the responsibility of the French
Parliament in preparing a bill on the transition of certain powers,
including health and education, to go before lawmakers in early
1999.
	   The referendum was a grassroots confirmation of the Noumea
Accord reached May 5 and designed to put to rest decades of
division on the archipelago that led to riots and bloodshed in the
1980s.
	   New Caledonians were asked to decide whether to accept a
transition period of ``shared sovereignty'' for the archipelago, a
French territory for the past 150 years.
	   With the referendum ratified, a new referendum will now be held
in 15-20 years to decide on total independence.
	   Apathy was the chief concern of the two sides in the conflict --
the Rally for Caledonia in the Republic -- the RPCR -- and the
Kanak and Socialist National Liberation Front -- the FLNKS, which
led the bloody struggle in the 1980s for independence.
	   Mounting social tension marked by strikes has preoccupied the
population, hit by the plummeting price of nickel -- the main
resource in New Caledonia, which has an estimated 30 percent of the
world's nickel reserve.
	   Angry dockers last week blocked the Noumea port to press demands
for improved indemnities as part of a plan to let go workers.
Workers from an adversary union countered, threatening a general
strike if access to the port was not assured.
	   Elsewhere, small-time miners, threatened by large mining groups
and diminishing incomes, blocked the main island road to press for
guarantees that would assure their survival.
	   The Noumea Accord, concluded between Paris, the FLNKS and the
RPCR, followed a decade of violence in the Pacific island marked by
fierce riots and political killings in the 1980s that stunned the
French and galvanized the search for a peaceful solution.
	   New Caledonia is about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) east of
Australia. Nearly half of the archipelago's population are native
Kanaks or Melanesians, and about one-third are of European origin.
The rest are from other parts of Polynesia.

Schroeder's jobless plan draws fire from business
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder suggested in
an interview published Sunday that Germans be eased into earlier
retirement as a way to open up jobs and fight double-digit
unemployment. A top business lobby rejected the plan as too
expensive.
	   Schroeder told the weekly Bild am Sonntag he would propose that
labor and business agree to let workers retire with full benefits
at 60, five years earlier than usual. The two sides could set up
new funds to finance the increased costs, he said.
	   Schroeder, elected in September on a pledge to combat 10-percent
unemployment, is gearing up for round-table talks on job creation
with business and labor due to start next month.
	   Lowering the retirement age would be a priority, along with a
previously announced plan to find jobs for 100,000 young jobless,
he said.
	   But Dieter Hundt, head of the powerful German Association of
Employers, called the retirement plan ``unaffordable'' and ``an
inept attempt to redistribute work.''
	   If people retire early, they must accept a cut in the
government-mandated benefits, he told the Allgemeine Zeitung in
Mainz.
	   How any new funds would be financed is unclear. Labor, which
supports the idea, wants industry to pay the bulk. Other proposals
call for employees to fund the plan by giving up part of their pay
increases. The government would subsidize the effort.
	   Schroeder's center-left government over the weekend apparently
settled a squabble about another major project: raising energy
taxes to create room to lower welfare-state levies on business and
make Germany more competitive.
	   Environment Minister Juergen Trittin said late Saturday that his
Greens party and the dominant Social Democrats had stymied a move
by pro-market Schroeder allies to exempt all of industry from
planned hikes in heating oil, gas and electricity prices.
	   Instead, the coalition is sticking with earlier plans to exempt
only energy intensive industries such as steel and automaking, he
said in Berlin.
	   Both parties were to discuss details Monday, he said. The
government wants to start introducing its tax reform in parliament
this week.

Fairly strong earthquake rattles Tokyo area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A fairly strong earthquake with a preliminary
magnitude of 4.9 shook Yokohama, Tokyo and nearby areas Sunday
night, but there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.
	   The quake, at 9:40 p.m. (1240 GMT), was strong enough to shake
houses and topple vases. It was most strongly felt in Yokohama, a
major port city 29 kilometers (18 miles) southwest of Tokyo.
	   Kimihiro Tanabe, a police official in Kanagawa prefecture
(state), where Yokohama is located, said there had been no reports
of damage or injuries.
	   The Central Meteorological Agency said the quake's center was
about 80 kilometers (48 miles) undersea in Tokyo Bay off Yokohama.
	   No tsunami were expected, the agency said.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Attempts by dissident groups to have
foreign leaders brought to trial in Spain have little hope of
succeeding, Foreign Minister Abel Matutes was quoted as saying
Sunday in a Madrid daily.
	   Dissident group' hopes of bringing foreign leaders to court were
buoyed Friday when the Spanish government agreed to ask Britain to
extradite former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to be tried in
Spain on charges of genocide, terrorism and torture during his rule
from 1973 to 1990.
	   A Cuban exile group filed suit in Spain last week accusing Cuban
leader Fidel Castro of genocide, terrorism and torture and others
have asked for investigations of General Hugo Banzer of Bolivia and
Morocco's King Hassan, Matutes said.
	   ``Spanish law clearly recognizes jurisdictional immunity of
heads of state and senior officials,'' said Matutes who is heading
Monday for a three-day visit to Cuba.
	   Matutes stressed that the decision to seek extradition was a
legal obligation of the Spanish government beyond its control.
	   ``It is not a political decision, but just a fulfillment of the
law, the government has limited itself to act as a messenger of the
judicial authority,'' he said.
	   Chile responded to the extradition request by recalling his
ambassador to Spain for consultations. The Chilean government,
however, said that diplomatic ties with Madrid would not be broken
or suspended.
	   Matutes said Spain hopes to quickly repair its relations with
Chile.
	   ``Both Chilean Foreign Minister Jose Miguel Insulza and myself
want to preserve the two countries' good relations,'' Matutes said.

80 years on, World War I dead are remembered in Flanders Fields
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY107-09 &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   YPRES, Belgium (AP) _ Hunched against an autumn drizzle, the
mason bends towards a weathered white tombstone and applies a fine
jet of compressed air to words made faint by decades of exposure to
the chill winds of Flanders Fields.
	   Soon the stark inscription reads clearly again: ``Private C.B.
Laugher, 5th Bn. Australian Infantry, 24th, September, 1916, age
19.''
	   The grave done, the mason picks up his tools and moves to the
next in seemingly endless rows of headstones.
	   Pvt. Laugher was one among the 200,000 British and Commonwealth
soldiers whose deaths in World War I are recorded on graves and
monuments around Ypres.
	   ``Every year, during the whole year, we do nothing but this,''
says Ivan Vermote, one of 24 stonemasons who work out of Ypres for
the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.
	   Ypres will be the focus of ceremonies Tuesday marking the 80th
anniversary of the armistice that ended The Great War on Nov. 11,
1918.
	   Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and Belgium's King Albert II will
attend the remembrance service along with a handful of surviving
veterans.
	   The monarchs will stand under the giant Menin Gate that is
carved with the names of 54,000 Commonwealth soldiers whose bodies
were never recovered from the Flanders mud. Local buglers will play
``Taps'' as they have every day for decades.
	   In a ceremony packed with symbolism, Queen Elizabeth will also
join Irish President Mary McAleese in the nearby town of Mesen to
remember 50,000 Irishmen who fell in the war.
	   The monument they will unveil to Roman Catholic and Protestant
Irish who died fighting shoulder-to-shoulder is meant as a symbol
for modern-day reconciliation after this year's peace agreement for
Northern Ireland.
	   From 1914 to 1918, British and allied troops fought a war of
attrition against the Germans in the trenches around Ypres. They
prevented the Kaiser's armies capturing English Channel ports, but
paid a terrible cost.
	   Today in the flat, featureless landscape, it seems every twist
in the road reveals another cemetery, with its tight ranks of young
men's graves.
	   There is a German cemetery at nearby Langemarck where 44,000 lie
beneath slabs of dark gray stone. There are monuments to fallen
Belgian and French soldiers and to American ``doughboys'' who died
in the final months of the war.
	   But it is the British dead who most haunt this town where the
carnage prompted Winston Churchill to say ``a more sacred place for
the British race does not exist in the world.''
	   Despite the passing of time, the 137 British cemeteries in
Flanders are meticulously maintained by a team of 190
administrators, gardeners and stonemasons working for the Ypres
office of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.
	   Fewer family members come to mourn the dead these days. They are
replaced by a growing number of students and tourists.
	   ``It's becoming more historical rather than emotional. Most of
the people who fought in the war are long gone,'' says Jim Cooke,
works supervisor of the commission.
	   However, he adds, ``I've witnessed youngsters of 14 and 15 break
down in tears ... it comes as a shock for the first time when you
stand in the cemetery and see the enormity of it all.''
	   The mud of Flanders still yields a grim harvest of bodies from
the war. Four or five are uncovered every year.

Israel quiet on pair arrested in Cyprus as spy suspects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel was officially silent Sunday on the
subject of two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on suspicion of spying,
but a government official said Israeli diplomats would likely visit
them in prison.
	   Cypriot authorities arrested the Israelis Saturday in the
community of Ziyi near the southern coastal resort of Larnaca for
allegedly spying on a nearby army base.
	   Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Effii Ben-Matityahu had no
comment on the arrests other than to note that officials from the
Israeli consulate were expected to go to the Nicosia prison where
the two were being held.
	   In Israel, some former officials and analysts expressed doubts
that the two were working for the Mossad secret service.
	   A Cypriot police source said the Israelis were suspected of
spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern
third of Cyprus in 1974.
	   Turkey has significantly increased military cooperation with
Israel in the past two years, chilling Israel's relations with
Cyprus. Israeli military analyst Ron Ben Yishai, writing in the
Yediot Ahronoth newspaper, suggested the arrests were meant as a
warning to Israel not to cooperate with Turkey in any spy
operation.
	   Senior intelligence sources told the Maariv newspaper that the
Mossad would not take such risks to gather intelligence on Turkey's
behalf.
	   Cypriot police officials said Saturday they found cameras,
wireless instruments, tapes of conversations between police, radio
scanners and maps in the apartment the two were renting.
	   Cypriot police said the two would be brought before a remand
hearing Nov. 16.

Egypt pulls the plug on liberal call-in radio
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Radio Cairo has pulled the plug on a popular
radio call-in show that enraged conservatives by addressing taboo
topics such as rape, infidelity, incest and premarital sex.
	   The show's host, Buthayna Kamel, said officials told her that
they would no longer allow the broadcast of ``Nocturnal
Confessions.''
	   The show repeatedly was taken off the air in recent months.
	   ``It is time that I make my confessions to my listeners that the
program was stopped against my will,'' Kamel, a prominent
television anchor, said in a statement to the press.
	   Kamel said she was given no reason for the show's cancellation,
but added that in the past officials said they had received
complaints from listeners.
	   ``I appeal to the Minister of Information to intervene
personally and bring the show back to its listeners,'' she said.
	   The last show was broadcast on Oct. 30 and she was not allowed
to go on the air Friday, she told the Associated Press.
	   Listeners call in to the weekly program to seek help about
romance and family or social problems.
	   The program has come under fire from Islamic fundamentalists who
accuse it of obscenity.
	   Even those of a less-religious shade have been taken aback by
talk considered tawdry in Egypt's deeply conservative society.
	   Earlier this year the government banned a popular newspaper in
which Kamel published excerpts from calls that radio officials
found too hot to broadcast.

Milan police step up security after a warning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Milan police have stepped up security in the
subway system and other crowded public places after a warning of a
possible terrorist attack, Italian news reports said Sunday.
	   Milan police headquarters confirmed that surveillance had been
heightened but declined to elaborate.
	   Police increased security along Milan's 70-kilometers (45 miles)
of subway track, the reports said. Airports and railroad stations
were also reportedly being carefully watched.
	   The Milan daily Il Giorno reported Sunday that Milan police had
been tipped that the subway might be a possible target.
	   The Italian news agency ANSA, said Italy's anti-terrorism squad,
SISDE, was investigating. The tip did not indicate who was
supposedly behind the threat nor exactly what might be the target,
RAI state TV said.
	   ANSA quoted police sources as saying the tip came in late
October and indicated that an attack might come in early November.
	   Investigators were considering the possibility of involvement of
anarchists, who have been active in Italy's north, although
involvement by Islamic fundamentalists or the Italian Mafia was not
ruled out, ANSA said.
	   Anarchists were linked to a bomb found in 1997 near Milan's city
hall. Earlier this year another bomb was found in the city. No
claim was made.

Yemeni kills six, injures his mother, with hand grenade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A man killed six people and injured his
mother when he threw a hand grenade into a neighbor's house in
southern Yemen, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The man's mother was visiting the home of her neighbor, Hadi
Nasr Nasser, when her son threw a hand grenade into an open window,
the al-Ayam newspaper reported.
	   It did not say whether he knew his mother was in the house at
the time.
	   The man, who was not identified, was upset because of a land
dispute with Nasser, the paper reported.
	   Police are searching for the man, who fled after the incident in
the southern province of Lahej, the newspaper reported. It did not
give other details.
	   Fighting among rival clans, mostly over territorial claims, is
common in Yemen, an impoverished and largely tribal country of
about 17 million people in the southern part of the Arabian
Peninsula.
	   Weapons, including hand grenades, heavy machine guns, rocket
launchers and artillery, are not difficult to buy in Yemen.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Bucharest residents tried for a third
time Sunday to elect a new city leader in a second runoff between
the incumbent may and the director of the city's hospital.
	   Incumbent Mayor Viorel Lis and Sorin Oprescu finished well ahead
of 20 other contenders for the post in the first runoff one week
ago, which was called after the initial election was declared
invalid because not enough people voted. Lis led last week with
45.6 percent of the vote, well ahead of Oprescu with 26.3 percent,
but short of the required 50 percent, forcing the runoff to be
repeated.
	   Polls opened at 6 a.m. (0400 GMT) and were to close at 9 p.m.
(1900 GMT) Sunday. Some 1.7 million people were expected to vote
Sunday but officials predicted turnout would be low.
	   To win, a candidate needs more votes than its contender and the
ballot would be considered valid, despite low turnout.
	   ``Only 11.70 percent of the voters have cast their ballots up to
now, which is below the numbers at this hour last week,'' said Rose
Marie Maliti of the Bucharest's elections bureau at 13:00 (1100
GMT).
	   Lis, 55, was the previous mayor's deputy and has been running
the city since April. He is the main political force of the ruling
coalition, the Democratic Convention, and is considered the main
favorite.
	   ``I'm not making promises, because I'm already doing something
for people,'' Lis told reporters after he voted early Sunday.
	   Oprescu, 47, is director for the Municipal Hospital in
Bucharest. He is supported by the former ruling party, the Social
Democracy Party and by the nationalist forces in Parliament.
	   ``Together we can pass over the hardships of the coming
winter,'' Oprescu said after casting his ballot.
	   Bucharest, a city of 3 million, is overcrowded and plagued with
a poor water supply, deteriorated roads and pollution. Since 1989
many problems have gotten worse, as the city's population has
increased.
	   The ballot for mayor became necessary when Bucharest's last
elected mayor Victor Ciorbea became prime minister in 1996. He
resigned from that job in April, quitting the post of mayor at the
same time.

Rousseau begins talks with his West Indian players

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ West Indian Cricket Board President Pat Rousseau
began talks Sunday with Courtney Walsh, Brian Lara and Carl Hooper,
trying to settle a pay dispute that threatens to wipe out the
islanders first official tour of South Africa.
	   Rousseau, who traveled overnight from the Caribbean _ meeting
demands he talk with the players _ fired Lara as captain and Hooper
as vice-captain on Wednesday over demands for better pay, setting
off the boycott.
	   ``The president coming is good news,'' Walsh said.
	   ``It's not just about money, it's general conditions and
everything.''
	   Asked as he entered the talks if Lara and Hooper would be
reinstated, Rousseau replied, ``I can't answer that right now.''
	   South African cricket head Ali Bacher said Sunday he was hopeful
a resolution was at hand.
	   ``I remain optimistic that we will get a solution today once the
two parties sit down and talk to each other,'' he said. ``I am
scheduled to leave on the 9.15 p.m. plane tonight. The first prize
would be get the players out tonight, the second prize would have
them traveling tomorrow.''
	   ``We want to play the West Indies but we want to beat their best
team,'' he added, noting a canceled tour would ``cost us tens of
millions of rand.''
	   Bacher, West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd, and WICB member
Joel arrived in London Friday and have held two days of informal
and unfruitful talks with the players.
	   West Indian management and striking players are camped in
neighboring hotels near London's Heathrow Airport with players
practicing to stay fit.
	   The tour is scheduled to start with a one-day match at
Johannesburg on Tuesday. The first test is due to start on Nov. 26.
	   A key to settling the dispute is a letter sent to the players by
South African President Nelson Mandela. This would be the West
Indies' first official tour of South Africa since the end of
apartheid.
	   ``This tour is very important for this country,'' Bacher said.
``It goes beyond bat and ball. It will help enormously towards the
reconciliation process in South Africa and will inspire the youth
of the country.''
	   Reported solutions include more prize money, increased meal
money, and the reinstatement of Lara and Hopper to the squad. There
are also suggestions Walsh would be named captain.
	   The WICB has said it would fine the no-show players between 5
and 10 percent. Despite that, Lara and Hooper have wide support as
all team members have gathered in London to rally around them.
	   In a letter dated Friday, the Barbados Cricket Association urged
the WICB and players to reach a compromise and said Lara and Hooper
should be reinstated.
	   Barbadian legislator Clyde Mascoll was more forceful and said
``the board should be fired.''
	   In Port-of-Spain, the Trinidadian capital, Lara's fans set up a
massive blackboard in the heart of the city at Woodford Square and
dozens signed it to show ``100 percent support for Lara and his
men.''
	   The crisis is being compared to the one in 1978 when West Indies
players snubbed the national team and contracted with Australian
magnate Kerry Packer's World Series of Cricket.
	   Lara, the batting superstar of the sport, set a world record of
375 runs in a 1994 Test against England. A few weeks later, he
scored a first-class record of 501 for his English county side
Warwickshire.

Yemeni kills six, injures his mother, with hand grenade
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ A man angered by a land dispute killed six
people and injured his mother when he threw a hand grenade into a
neighbor's house in southern Yemen, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The man's mother was visiting the home of her neighbor, Hadi
Nasr Nasser, when her son threw a hand grenade into an open window,
the al-Ayam newspaper reported.
	   It did not say whether he knew his mother was in the house at
the time.
	   The man, who was not identified, was upset because of a land
dispute with Nasser, the paper reported.
	   Police are searching for the man, who fled after the incident in
the southern province of Lahej, the newspaper reported. It did not
give other details.
	   Fighting among rival clans, mostly over territorial claims, is
common in Yemen, an impoverished and largely tribal country of
about 17 million people in the southern part of the Arabian
Peninsula.

Queen leads wreath-laying for nation's war dead

	   LONDON (AP) _ Under dull gray skies, Queen Elizabeth II led
wreath-laying at the Cenotaph near the Houses of Parliament in the
centerpiece of traditional Remembrance Sunday services in memory of
the nation's war dead.
	   In similar ceremonies across the nation, Britons stood in
silence.
	   London's Heathrow Airport came to a standstill for two minutes'
silence.
	   The departure of a British Airways Concorde, Flight BA001 to New
York, was delayed 45 minutes until 11.15 a.m. (1115 GMT), and air
traffic controllers rerouted aircraft due to fly over central
London at 11 a.m. (1100 GMT).
	   A two-minute hush fell over Whitehall, the center of government,
when Big Ben, the clock at Parliament, struck 11.
	   The queen's husband, Prince Philip, and her second son, Prince
Andrew, political leaders and the High Commissioners, or
ambassadors, from former colonies also laid wreaths.
	   Then, while a band played ``There'll Always Be An England,''
hundreds of veterans, some in wheelchairs, joined a march past the
queen. Most were veterans of World War II.
	   The queen's 98-year-old mother, the Queen Mother Elizabeth,
watched the ceremony from a balcony overlooking Whitehall, the
center of government. She was flanked by the queen's daughter,
Princess Anne, and Anne's husband, Comdr. Timothy Laurence.
	   The queen's eldest son, Prince Charles, on a visit to Macedonia,
laid a wreath of poppies at small cemetery for British war dead in
the capital, Skopje.

Major League all-stars beat Japan 10-7
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Carlos Delgado drove in five runs with two homers
as a team of U.S. Major League stars beat their Japanese
counterparts 10-7 Sunday, yielding more than one run for the first
time in three games in Japan.
	   Sammy Sosa went 3-for-4, driving in two runs with a double in
the five-run third inning.
	   The major leaguers beat the Central League's third-place Yomiuri
Giants 4-1 on Friday and then started a seven-game series against
the Japanese stars with an 8-1 victory Saturday.
	   Playing before a capacity crowd of 55,000 at Tokyo Dome,
Delgado, of the Toronto Blue Jays, smashed a three-run home run
against Kenshin Kawakami in the first inning.
	   Kawakami of the Central league's second-place Chunichi Dragons
was the league's Rookie of the Year with a 14-6 record and 2.57
earned run average this season.
	   In the third inning, Sosa doubled home two runs after a single
by Fernando Vina of the Milwaukee Brewers, a walk to Jason Kendall
of the Pittsburgh Pirates and an infield hit by Delgado loaded the
bases.
	   The Major League stars added three more runs in the inning,
going ahead 8-1, on a sacrifice fly by Manny Ramirez of the
Cleveland Indians, a wild pitch by Kawakami and a double by Garret
Anderson of the Anaheim Angels.
	   In the fourth, Delgado made it 10-1 with a two-run home run
after a single by Kendall.
	   Delgado was named the game's most valuable player and received a
prize of 400,000 yen (dlrs 3,400).
	   Despite their loss, the Japanese matched the major leaguers' hit
total of 13.
	   Japan scored its first run in the second inning on a sacrifice
fly following two singles off starter Rick Helling of the Texas
Rangers, and its second in the fifth on Yokohama BayStars player
Takuro Ishii's single off Kevin Millwood of the Atlanta Braves, who
relieved Helling in that inning.
	   Ichiro Suzuki of the Orix BlueWave, who led the Pacific League
with a .358 average, singled home two runs off the major league's
third pitcher, Brett Tomko of the Cincinnati Reds, in the five-run
sixth inning.
	   Suzuki went 3-for-5, and stole second and third bases after a
single in the eighth inning.
	   Game 3 in the all-stars series is scheduled Tuesday at Fukuoka
Dome in southern Japan.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Bucharest residents tried for a third
time Sunday to elect a new city leader in a race that pitted the
incumbent against the director of the city's hospital.
	   Incumbent Mayor Viorel Lis and Sorin Oprescu finished well ahead
of 20 other contenders for the post in a repeat election a week
ago, which was called after the initial election was declared
invalid because of low turnout.
	   Lis led last week with 45.6 percent of the vote, well ahead of
Oprescu with 26.3 percent, but short of the 50 percent required to
avoid a runoff.
	   Polls opened at 6 a.m. (0400 GMT) and were to close at 9 p.m.
(1900 GMT) Sunday. Though officials predicted turnout would be low,
that would not affect the validity of the runoff.
	   ``Only 11.7 percent of the voters have cast their ballots up to
now, which is below the numbers at this hour last week,'' said Rose
Marie Maliti of the Bucharest's elections bureau at 13:00 (1100
GMT).
	   Lis, 55, was the previous mayor's deputy and has been running
the city since April. He is the main political force of the ruling
coalition, the Democratic Convention, and is considered the
favorite.
	   Oprescu, 47, is director for the Municipal Hospital in
Bucharest. He is supported by the former ruling party, the Social
Democracy Party and by the nationalist forces in Parliament.
	   Bucharest, a city of 3 million, is overcrowded and plagued with
a poor water supply, deteriorated roads and pollution. Since 1989
many problems have gotten worse, as the city's population has
increased.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A trial delayed 23 years by
Bangladesh's bitter and bloody politics culminated on Sunday with a
judge convicting and ordering death for 15 former military
commanders in the 1975 assassination of the country's first prime
minister.
	   Four others, including a former junior minister for information,
were acquitted in the killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, father of
current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, because there wasn't enough
evidence against them. After taking office in 1996, Hasina used her
power to bring her father's killers to trial, saying ensuring
justice would help entrench democracy in this volatile country.
	   Thousands of followers of Sheikh Mujib, as he is popularly known
in Bangladesh, danced in the streets outside the courtroom to
celebrate the verdict by Dhaka District Judge Kazi Golam Rasul.
Shouts of ``justice has prevailed!'' rang out.
	   Rasul ordered the sentences carried out in public by firing
squad, a departure from the normal practice of death by hanging. He
said this would be a lesson to the army which had failed in its
duty to protect the leader of the nation.
	   The convicted men said they would appeal the sentence in a
higher court.
	   Rahman, who led the country's independence war against Pakistan
in 1971, was gunned down by rebellious soldiers at his Dhaka
residence on Aug. 15 in 1975. Most of his family was also killed
that day; two daughters survived because they were out of the
country on holiday.
	   Months earlier, Rahman had instituted one-party rule and gave
himself more powers. His critics had accused him of authoritarian
rule and corruption, but his daughter says he was trying to ensure
order and would have restored democracy if he had been given time.
	   Rahman's killers granted themselves amnesties, and in the
ensuing political turmoil no one ever moved to bring them to trial
until Hasina came to power.
	   In its 27 years of history Bangladesh has witnessed the
assassination of two heads of government _ the first was Rahman;
three military coups; and 19 failed coup attempts. Sunday's verdict
ended the country's first trial of coup leaders in a civil court.
Military tribunals were set up to try the leaders of other coups.
	   After 149 days of hearings, the verdict was handed down to
retired army officers Syed Farooq Rahman, Sultan Shahriyar Rashid
Khan, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Khandaker Abdur Rashid, Aziz Pasha, Shariful
Haq Dalim, Bazlul Huda, Noor Chowdhury, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Rashed
Chowdhury, Ahmed Shariful Hasan, Kishmat Hashem, Abdul Majed,
Nazmul Ansar and Moslemuddin Ahmed.
	   The judge found Taheruddin Thakur, Abdul Wahab Joardar, Marfat
Ali Shah and Hashem Mridha not guilty.
	   Only five of the accused _ Syed Farooq Rahman, Khan, Ahmed,
Wahab and former junior Information Minister Thakur _ were in court
to hear the 90-minute verdict. The government is trying to track
down the others, all believed to have fled Bangladesh.
	   Fearing the verdict would spark violence, authorities had
deployed more than 10,000 security forces in Dhaka, the capital
city of 9 million. One person was killed on the eve of the verdict
on Saturday in clashes between opposition activists and supporters
of Hasina
	   On Sunday, a group of people in the southern city of Chittagong
went on a rampage after hearing the verdict, attacking homes and
damaging 25 shops and 30 vehicles.
	   But on the whole, Bangladesh appeared to take the verdict with
calm. Hussein Mohammad Ershad, former president and the leader of
the third largest party in the country, welcomed the verdict saying
the trial had been held in accordance with the law and people
should accept it.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A Swiss woman fell to her death as she tried
to climb out of a stalled cable car in northern Tehran, Iran's
Tourism Organization said Sunday.
	   The unidentified woman was caught in the cable car along with
her Swiss husband and three other companions on Friday, the
organization said in a statement.
	   It said she panicked and tried to climb out after breaking the
windows of the cable car, but was killed when she lost her balance
and fell to the snowy mountains below.
	   The statement said that 145 other people also were stuck due to
a technical fault that had stopped all cable cars for four hours.
Those people were helped to the ground by rescue workers.
	   ``Unfortunately, the Swiss lady panicked and tried to climb out
by herself,'' the statement said. Her companions were rescued.
	   The woman's identify was not immediately available.
	   The area where the cable cars are located in northern Tehran is
a popular visiting place. Iranians go there on the weekends for the
breathtaking sights and some fresh mountain air.

	   In second-round Group E competition in Nagoya, Russia improved
its record to 4-0 by trouncing Peru 15-2, 15-9, 15-6. Even if they
lose to the Netherlands in their final game of the round Monday,
the Russians will reach the semifinals.
	   Atlantic Olympic bronze medalist Brazil all but ended host
Japan's hopes for a semifinal place with a 15-10, 15-4, 15-7
victory.
	   Brazil is 3-1 and Japan dropped to third in the six-team group
with a 2-2 record.
	   The Netherlands also is 2-2, but with fewer sets won, after
beating the Dominican Republic 15-8, 15-3, 15-7.
	   On Monday, Japan meets the Dominican Republic (0-4), while
Brazil takes on Peru (1-3).
	   Despite its one-sided victory, Russia still needs to improve,
said head coach Nikolai Karpol.
	   ``To my regret, we could not show our high-level play, but we
won and we are going to prepare to advance to the final,'' he
added.
	   In Group F in Fukuoka, Cuba, also the Olympic champion, easily
beat Asian champion China 15-6, 15-8, 15-11, also advancing to
Wednesday's semifinals.
	   ``They were so powerful,'' Chinese coach Lang Ping said, adding
that her team could not maneuver to force the Cubans into trouble.
	   Croatia beat Italy 10-15, 15-13, 8-15, 15-12, 15-12, while
Bulgaria defeated South Korea 15-5, 12-15, 15-6, 15-12.
	   China, silver medalist at the Atlanta Olympics, fell to 2-2,
standing third behind Croatia, also 2-2 but with more sets won.
	   On Monday, Croatia plays Cuba, China meets Bulgaria (1-3) and
South Korea (2-2) takes on Italy (1-3).
	   The men's world championships start Friday and end Nov. 29.

Czech Senate lacks prestige and authority, Havel says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A week ahead of elections for the
Senate, Czech President Vaclav Havel criticized the upper chamber
of the parliament for failing to gain enough prestige and authority
during its two years of existence.
	   In a live interview on Czech public TV Sunday, Havel said he
hoped the Senate would become a body of trustworthy people _
leading entrepreneurs, university professors and union leaders _
which wouldn't merely pass laws, but would be able to discuss and
think about them in broader terms than its predecessor had done.
	   ``But it's far from playing such role,'' Havel said, adding that
the Senate is widely considered ``the lower number-two chamber,
which is redundant and costs money.''
	   While both the upper and lower chambers of parliament must pass
a law in order for it to become valid, the 81-seat Senate was
formed mainly to serve as a backstop in case of constitutional
crisis. Should the lower house be dissolved, the Senate can pass
laws on its own _ except for budgetary and constitutional measures.
	   But since its formation in 1996, the Senate has rarely agreed
with the upper house, earning it wide criticism from all members of
the political spectrum for not being effective enough. Several
parties, including the Communists and the ultranationalist
Republicans, have even called for its dissolving.
	   The opposition Civic Democratic Party, controls the majority of
seats in the Senate, followed by the ruling Social Democrats.
	   The elections, in which 27 seats are at stake, are scheduled for
next Friday and Saturday.

Police searching for two missing officers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police searched for a second
day Sunday for two officers who went missing in southwestern Kosovo
province, Serb sources said.
	   Dejan Djatlov, 23, and Ilija Vujosevic, 48, have been missing
since late Friday. Serb sources said they were abducted by
separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas who have gained ground in
parts of the contested Serbian province since the police and
federal army forces were scaled down under international pressure
last month.
	   Also Friday, five ethnic Albanian armed guerrillas died in a
shoot-out with Serbian police, also in southwestern Kosovo. The
Albanians were to be buried in their home villages Sunday. It was
unclear if the incidents were linked.
	   According to the Serb-run Media Center, the two officers were
distributing food to remote police checkpoints some 40 kilometers
(25 miles) southwest of province's capital Pristina, when they went
missing. The two are the latest among a few dozen Serbian policemen
to go missing since fighting escalated last February. Since then
several hundred people _ including more than 100 police _ have been
killed and up to 300,000 driven from their homes.
	   Violence in predominately ethnic Albanian Kosovo has flared anew
this past week, despite a de-facto peace treaty designed to end
bloodshed in the turbulent province and set the stage for a
political agreement between Serb authorities and Albanian leaders.
	   The continued fighting undermines an Oct. 12 agreement between
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke, reached under the threat of NATO airstrikes on Yugoslav
and Serb forces in the region.
	   The Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement calls for setting up a 2,000
strong verification mission of unarmed observers run by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Until it
begins operating, unlikely before next month, a previous observer
mission started in July will continue to operate patrols throughout
Kosovo.
	   Members of the mission, along with international officials in
the province, say despite last week's incidents, the overall
situation has improved considerably since the deal was signed.
	   The deal envisages returning virtual autonomy to Kosovo's
Albanians, while keeping it within Yugoslavia, which is made up of
dominant Serbia and Montenegro.
	   On Saturday, Kosovo Serbs protested against the possible
political deal, saying it would result in Milosevic effectively
handing Kosovo to the ethnic Albanians.
	   A gathering of the Serbs in Pristina _ including Serb leaders,
opposition politicians and Serbian Orthodox Church dignitaries _
said they opposed having Milosevic's regime sign any agreement on
Kosovo on their behalf.
	   In a unanimously adopted charter, the Pan-Serb Convention warned
the international community of a likely ``massive exodus of Serbs''
if ethnic Albanians come to power in Kosovo.

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ Government troops overpowered a
group of rebel fighters holed up in an northern city, and were
still fighting another band of militants in the restive Central
Asian republic Sunday.
	   More than 200 combatants and civilians have been killed since
the rebels launched raids in the northern part of the country
Wednesday.
	   Government troops ousted 40 rebels holed up in an ancient
fortress in the northern city of Khudzhand, capturing at least 30
of the militants, said presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov.
	   The Interfax news agency reported that 70 government soldiers
and civilians had been killed in the fighting in Khudzhand and the
nearby town of Chkalovsk. Government officials reported that 300
people, including 110 civilians, were wounded.
	   The soldiers also freed dozens of Interior Ministry soldiers who
had been held hostage inside the Khudzhand fortress, about 200
kilometers (125 miles) north of the capital Dushanbe. The village
was the site of the first attack on Wednesday.
	   Government troops were still searching for rebels who left the
town into surrounding districts, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Meanwhile, government officials said they were closing in on an
estimated 200 remaining rebels who are scattered around the
northern village of Aini, about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of
the capital, after surrounding them Saturday.
	   So far, 40 rebels have been killed and 10 government soldiers
wounded in the fighting, Saidov said.
	   The rebels are led by former army Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev, who
has demanded that President Emomali Rakhmonov free all political
prisoners and bring his supporters into the government. The
president has ruled out any talks with the rebels.
	   The Tajikistan Prosecutor General's office announced Sunday that
it has started an investigation into the rebel attacks, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Tajikistan's rebels signed a peace treaty with the government
last year, formally ended five years of civil war between the
mostly Muslim opposition and Rakhmonov's hardline, secular
government. The main opposition groups are now participating in the
government and the armed forces.
	   Still, some rebel leaders do not recognize the accords and
continue attacks on a smaller scale throughout the poor,
mountainous former Soviet republic.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In a sharp rebuff to American executives, British
shareholders in LucasVarity PLC have blocked an attempt to move the
headquarters of the big auto components and aerospace company from
Britain to the United States.
	   Shareholders owning 73.9 percent of the group's share capital
voted in favor, but that fell just short of the 75 percent required
under company rules, LucasVarity announced Saturday.
	   The Anglo-American giant's U.S.-dominated executive board had
wanted to move the headquarters to Buffalo, New York, abandoning
its listing on London's Financial Times index of 100 top shares for
a New York listing.
	   ``We would like to thank the large majority of shareholders who
supported the proposal,'' LucasVarity chairman Ed Wallis said in a
terse statement on the vote, taken Friday night.
	   ``It's business as usual,'' Wallis added.
	   However, the dispute had been colored by British-American
rivalry _ a feature since the group valued at more than dlrs 5
billion was established in 1996 when 100-year-old Lucas Industries
PLC, based in the Birmingham, central England, and Buffalo-based
Varity Corp. merged.

Steffi Graf wins 105th career title in comeback event
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Steffi Graf extended her perfect record
against Nathalie Tauziat by beating the second-seeded Frenchwoman
6-3, 6-4 to win the Leipzig Open for the fifth time Sunday, capping
a comeback from wrist surgery and two-month layoff.
	   Graf collected the 105th title of her career and raised her
record against Tauziat to 20-0, without ever dropping a set.
	   Her career curtailed by injuries in the last couple of years,
Graf was unseeded in a tournament for the first time in 13 years.
	   The 29-year-old German struggled in her early matches but kept
on winning to reach the final.
	   ``I never expected this win so I am very happy to have achieved
it,'' Graf said. ``After all the injuries it's not so easy to come
back.''
	   Graf now has a chance of qualifying for the season-ending Chase
Championships in New York later this month.

Police searching for two missing officers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police searched for a second
day Sunday for two officers who missing from southwestern Kosovo
province, Serb sources said.
	   Dejan Djatlov, 23, and Ilija Vujosevic, 48, have been missing
since late Friday. Serb sources said they were abducted by
separatist ethnic Albanian guerrillas who have gained ground in
parts of the contested Serbian province since the police and
federal army forces were scaled down under international pressure
last month.
	   Also Friday, five ethnic Albanian armed guerrillas died in a
shoot-out with Serbian police, also in southwestern Kosovo. The
Albanians were to be buried in their home villages Sunday. It was
unclear if the incidents were linked.
	   According to the Serb-run Media Center, the two officers were
distributing food to remote police checkpoints some 40 kilometers
(25 miles) southwest of province's capital Pristina, when they
disappeared. The two are the latest among several dozen Serbian
police officers to disappear since fighting escalated last
February. Since then several hundred people _ including more than
100 police _ have been killed and up to 300,000 driven from their
homes.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in the
Yugoslav federation.
	   Violence in predominately ethnic Albanian Kosovo has flared anew
this past week, despite a de-facto peace treaty designed to end
bloodshed in the turbulent province and set the stage for a
political agreement between Serb authorities and Albanian leaders.
	   The Oct. 12 agreement between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke calls for setting up a
verification mission of 2,000 unarmed observers run by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Until it
begins operating, unlikely before next month, a previous observer
mission started in July will continue to patrol Kosovo.
	   Members of the mission, along with international officials in
the province, say despite last week's incidents, the overall
situation has improved considerably since the deal was signed.
	   The deal envisages returning virtual autonomy to Kosovo's
Albanians, while keeping the province within Yugoslavia.
	   On Saturday, Kosovo Serbs protested against the possible
political deal, saying it would result in Milosevic effectively
handing Kosovo to the ethnic Albanians.

Defense Secretary to see warplanes in Kuwait
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Defense Secretary George Robertson left Sunday for
Kuwait to inspect British warplanes on standby for possible strikes
against Iraq.
	   ``People know what they are up against. They know where they
stand,'' Robertson said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio
interview before leaving.
	   Robertson will also consult with government leaders in Kuwait
and Bahrain over the willingness to use force.
	   Britain dispatched 12 Tornado fighter-bombers to Kuwait in
February as part of a military buildup after Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein blocked U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Robertson said Saturday that although Saddam is again defying
the United Nations the time for military action had not yet come.

UEFA meets to consider whether to ban Fiorentina
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ European soccer officials gathered Sunday to
decide how to punish Fiorentina over an explosion last week that
injured a match official and caused the suspension of a UEFA Cup
game against Grasshoppers.
	   The Italian club risks forfeiting the match and thus being
kicked out of this season's _ and possibly future _ European soccer
competition.
	   It could also face a hefty fine. Fiorentina will be considered
lucky if UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Commission merely orders
Tuesday's match replayed behind closed doors.
	   Fiorentina was leading 2-1 after the first 45 minutes of play.
Having won the first leg against the Swiss side 2-0, it expected
easily to advance to the third round of the UEFA Cup.
	   But the match in Salerno, near Naples, was suspended after a
Belgian off-field official was injured by the explosion of a device
hurled from the stands at the interval.
	   Philippe Flament, the ``fourth man,'' who stations at midfield
helping the referee and linesmen, was taken to hospital with a
right knee injury.
	   Fiorentina officials have argued that the team should not be
punished as it was the act of an isolated individual rather than a
large group of their fans. Italian papers reported that police
questioned a local Salerno man who was a suspect.
	   Fiorentina and Salerno fans have a history of rivalry.
	   The game was being played in Salerno because Fiorentina was
paying the second and last round of suspension of its Franchi
stadium as a result fan violence during a 1997 Cup Winners Cup
game.
	   Fiorentina hoped to raise funds for victims of recent flooding
in southern Italy. Even though not on its home ground, it was still
responsible for security.
	   If Fiorentina does lose the match through default, then
Grasshoppers will play Bordeaux of France in the third round Nov.
24 and Dec. 8.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A trial delayed 23 years by
Bangladesh's bitter and bloody politics culminated on Sunday with a
judge convicting and ordering death for 15 former military
commanders in the 1975 assassination of the country's first prime
minister.
	   Four others, including a former junior minister for information,
were acquitted in the killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, father of
current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, because there wasn't enough
evidence against them. After taking office in 1996, Hasina used her
power to bring her father's killers to trial, saying ensuring
justice would help entrench democracy in this volatile country.
	   Thousands of followers of Sheikh Mujib, as he is popularly known
in Bangladesh, danced in the streets outside the courtroom to
celebrate the verdict by Dhaka District Judge Kazi Golam Rasul.
Shouts of ``justice has prevailed!'' rang out.
	   Hasina visited her former home where her father was executed
shortly after the verdict was announced.
	   ``Bangladesh will be free of a curse the day the killers will be
executed,'' Hasina told reporters as she broke into tears.
	   Rasul ordered the sentences carried out in public by firing
squad, a departure from the normal practice of death by hanging. He
said this would be a lesson to the army which had failed in its
duty to protect the leader of the nation.
	   The convicted men said they would appeal the sentence in a
higher court.
	   Rahman, who led the country's independence war against Pakistan
in 1971, was gunned down by rebellious soldiers at his Dhaka
residence on Aug. 15 in 1975. Most of his family was also killed
that day; two daughters survived because they were out of the
country on holiday.
	   Months earlier, Rahman had instituted one-party rule and gave
himself more powers. His critics had accused him of authoritarian
rule and corruption, but his daughter says he was trying to ensure
order and would have restored democracy if he had been given time.
	   Rahman's killers granted themselves amnesties, and in the
ensuing political turmoil no one ever moved to bring them to trial
until Hasina came to power.
	   In its 27 years of history Bangladesh has witnessed the
assassination of two heads of government _ the first was Rahman;
three military coups; and 19 failed coup attempts. Sunday's verdict
ended the country's first trial of coup leaders in a civil court.
Military tribunals were set up to try the leaders of other coups.
	   After 149 days of hearings, the verdict was handed down to
retired army officers Syed Farooq Rahman, Sultan Shahriyar Rashid
Khan, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Khandaker Abdur Rashid, Aziz Pasha, Shariful
Haq Dalim, Bazlul Huda, Noor Chowdhury, Mohiuddin Ahmed, Rashed
Chowdhury, Ahmed Shariful Hasan, Kishmat Hashem, Abdul Majed,
Nazmul Ansar and Moslemuddin Ahmed.
	   The judge found Taheruddin Thakur, Abdul Wahab Joardar, Marfat
Ali Shah and Hashem Mridha not guilty.
	   Only five of the accused _ Syed Farooq Rahman, Khan, Ahmed,
Wahab and former junior Information Minister Thakur _ were in court
to hear the 90-minute verdict. The government is trying to track
down the others, all believed to have fled Bangladesh.
	   One of the convicted men, retired Major Bazlul Huda, was
extradited to Bangladesh on Sunday from Bangkok, Thailand, where he
was arrested on shoplifting charges, police said. He was flown in
on a special flight to Dhaka.
	   Fearing the verdict would spark violence, authorities had
deployed more than 10,000 security forces in Dhaka, the capital
city of 9 million. One person was killed on the eve of the verdict
on Saturday in clashes between opposition activists and supporters
of Hasina
	   On Sunday, a group of people in the southern city of Chittagong
went on a rampage after hearing the verdict, attacking homes and
damaging 25 shops and 30 vehicles.
	   But on the whole, Bangladesh appeared to take the verdict with
calm. Hussein Mohammad Ershad, former president and the leader of
the third largest party in the country, welcomed the verdict saying
the trial had been held in accordance with the law and people
should accept it.

Rescuers lose hope for 15 sailors off South African coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Rescuers lost hope on Sunday of
finding 15 crew members from a trawler that capsized off the Indian
Ocean coast of South Africa, an official said.
	   Neil Brink, port captain of Richard's Bay, said no additional
survivors had been found since rescue efforts started on Saturday.
	   ``We expect the bodies to start surfacing by tomorrow,'' Brink
said.
	   The Greek captain, Stamatis Stogiannos, 58, was picked up alive
near the St Lucia lighthouse on Saturday.
	   ``The ship overturned and sank within 30 seconds, according to
information from the survivor. The guys didn't have much of a
chance to get into life rafts,'' Brink said.
	   The 28-meter (84-foot) trawler Daniela, registered to a Greek
company in the South African port of Durban, appears to have sunk
on Saturday, not on Friday as initial reports indicated, the South
African Press Association reported.
	   Two Air Force planes, a port helicopter, police and the National
Sea Rescue Institute helped in the search.
	   Brink said they found debris including two lifebouys, two life
jackets, and plastic and wooden items.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Kazakh Deputy Energy Minister Dosayev
Yevbolat said Sunday that Kazakhstan intends to increase the amount
of oil to be transferred to Iran under their existing swaps
agreement.
	   Under the deal, signed in 1996, Kazakhstan was to have supplied
2 million metric tons a year of oil to refineries in northern Iran
and to have received the same amount of oil in the Gulf for export
to world markets.
	   The deal has never been fully implemented because of quality
problems incurred when the Kazakh crude was initially processed at
Iran's northern refineries.
	   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Yevbolat as
saying that Kazakhstan hopes to transfer its oil to Iran following
construction of an oil pipeline via Turkmenistan.
	   The deputy minister, who spoke at a two-day Caspian conference
in Tehran, said his country considers cooperation among the five
Caspian States to be essential.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Non-Jordanian trading grew by 20.8 percent
to 23 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 32.4 million) on the stock
exchange in October compared with the month before.
	   Brokers said Saturday a peace deal signed between the
Palestinians and Israel in October encouraged investors to return
to the floor at the bourse, also known as the Amman Financial
Market.
	   Non-Jordanian investors bought 10 million dinars (dlrs 1.4
million) and sold 13 million dinars (dlrs 18.3 million) worth of
shares in October, said Bassam Saket, the Jordanian market's
director general.
	   In September, non-Jordanians bought 5.3 million dinars (dlrs 7.4
million) and sold 5 million dinars (dlrs 7 million) worth of shares
on the market, Saket said.
	   He said the increase helped shore up share transactions by
foreigners, which declined by 20.3 percent to 43 million dinars
(dlrs 60.5 million) between January and October this year compared
with the same period in 1997.
	   There are several Western, Asian and Gulf Arab businessmen
trading at the Amman bourse.

Aziz: `Iraq adheres to its stance' banning U.N. inspections
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ As U.S. officials consulted on a possible
military strike against Iraq, a top Iraqi official said Sunday that
the government would not back down on its decision to ban U.N. arms
inspections.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told the official Iraqi News
Agency that the government was not moved by a U.N. Security Council
resolution last week holding it in ``flagrant violation'' of U.N.
edicts.
	   ``Iraq adheres to its stance until the Security Council fulfills
its obligation toward Iraq,'' INA quoted Aziz as saying. This, he
said, involved lifting the ban on oil sales ``as a start toward the
final lifting of the whole embargo.''
	   Iraq's trade minister, Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, also told reporters
that Iraq is unconcerned by U.S. threats.
	   ``Our country is prepared to face any military aggression,'' he
said.
	   Iraq last month announced it was halting cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors until the Security Council begins moving to lift
the embargo, which has devastated Iraq's economy.
	   The Security Council has said the embargo won't be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction, as required by U.N. resolutions that ended the
1991 Gulf War over the Kuwait occupation.
	   Aziz's comments came after he met a delegation of Irish and
Scottish politicians led by Ireland's former prime minister, Albert
Reynolds, who said they opposed the use of force against Iraq.
	   ``I think nothing is solved by military action,'' said Tam
Dalyell, a Scottish member of the British Parliament who
accompanied Reynolds. ``It just creates a bitterness between old
friends that I deplore.''
	   Dalyell said Reynolds planned to brief U.S. President Bill
Clinton about his findings in Baghdad, adding: ``I hope it does
some good.''
	   The United States and Britain have threatened possible military
action to force Baghdad to allow U.N. weapons inspections to
resume.
	   On Sunday, Clinton was meeting at Maryland's Camp David
presidential retreat with Defense Secretary William Cohen, who just
completed a tour of the Gulf, and National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger, who consulted last week with Britain and France.
	   U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait
prevent the export of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay, and trade as
well.
	   Earlier Sunday, Trade Minister Saleh said a possible American
military strike would be no harder on the country than the
sanctions.
	   The government has blamed the sanctions for shortages of food
and medicine as well as the deterioration of its water, sewage and
electricity systems. These problems, it says, has taken the lives
of 1.5 million Iraqis over the past eight years, many of them
children.
	   ``We are losing 4,500 children per month _ that means nearly
60,000 per year,'' Saleh said. ``I don't think a military strike
would kill 60,000 children as sanctions are killing now.''
	   Iraq's decision to halt inspections is aimed at the U.N. Special
Commission, which is charged with eliminating Iraq's biological and
chemical weapons as well as long-range missiles.
	   Iraq has demanded that UNSCOM be restructured to include fewer
American and British experts and that its chairman, Australian
Richard Butler, be replaced.
	   Iraq has long accused Butler of working on behalf of the United
States to prolong the sanctions as a way to undermine President
Saddam Hussein.
	   The Iraqi ban exempts monitors from the Vienna-headquartered
International Atomic Energy Agency. On Sunday, two nuclear
monitoring teams went into the field, U.N. officials said.

Report: Wembley twin towers coming down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEMBLEY, England (AP) _ The famous twin towers of Wembley
Stadium are going to be demolished in a redevelopment plan.
	   Work begins next year on rebuilding the historic stadium.
Original plans called for saving the towers, but architects have
concluded the towers cannot be conserved, The Sunday Telegraph
reported.
	   ``That was certainly the original wish when this project was
being contemplated because they are a landmark of Wembley,'' said
Graham Kelly, chief executive of the English Football Association.
``In any project of this size, there are changes along the way.''
	   ``I don't know whether it would be possible to keep the Twin
Towers or not,'' he added.
	   The newspaper said English Heritage _ the agency protecting
national monuments _ had been informed that the towers will not fit
in with the futuristic design of the new stadium.
	   Architects also point out that the new stadium will be located
north of its present site, which would leave the towers in the
center of the pitch.
	   The new stadium is a key to England's bid to land the 2006 World
Cup, with South Africa and Germany among the other leading
contenders.

Guerrillas attack Israeli-allied militia in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new details in 1st graf and Israeli army comment
in 6th graf

<TEXT>
	   RASHAYA, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas fired a rocket, mortars and
rocket-propelled grenades at Israeli-backed militiamen Sunday,
provoking Israeli air and artillery retaliation, security officials
said.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the early morning
fighting in the eastern sector of the Israeli-occupied buffer zone
in south Lebanon, the officials said.
	   Guerrillas attacked a barracks of Israel's proxy militia called
the South Lebanon Army at Kawkaba inside the occupied enclave,
seven kilometers (four miles) southwest of the border town of
Rashaya.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
	   Israeli helicopters gunships opened up with machine guns as the
guerrillas withdrew under artillery and tank fire from Israeli and
militia positions, according to the officials, who spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   At least 150 shells blasted the area, the Lebanese officials
added.
	   In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman said one rocket was
fired at an SLA position, but there were no casualties. Israeli and
SLA artillery returned fire, he said.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah group is leading a guerrilla war to
expel Israeli forces and their allied Lebanese militiamen from the
440-square-mile (1,100-square-kilometer) enclave, which Israel
established in 1985 to guard against cross-border guerrilla forays.
The zone has a predominantly Shiite population of 200,000.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Local elections in three Mexican states were
viewed Sunday as an important barometer of the strength of the
country's three major political parties ahead of the 2000
presidential elections.
	   As polls opened Sunday morning, the race for governor in the
Pacific coast state of Sinaloa appeared extremely tight between the
candidates of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known

Yeltsin back from vacation earlier than expected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin unexpectedly returned to
Moscow late Sunday, nearly a week before he was scheduled to end
his medically mandated vacation in the southern resort town of
Sochi, his press service said.
	   Kremlin spokeswoman Vera Barysheva declined to comment on
Yeltsin's condition, or why the president had come back earlier
than expected. When Yeltsin went to Sochi on Oct. 30, just over a
week ago, the Kremlin had said he would be there two weeks,
recuperating from exhaustion.
	   In recent months, the 67-year-old Yeltsin has steadily receded
from public view, taking frequent vacations and periodically
checking into government rest homes or sanitariums.
	   He has been described as suffering from nothing worse than bad
colds or, in the latest case, exhaustion. Public skepticism is
growing, and Communists in the lower house of parliament _ who had
first-hand experience hiding leaders' ailments in the Soviet period
_ have begun to demand a full accounting of his physical condition.
	   Russia's Supreme Court ruled last week that Yeltsin cannot seek
a third term in office, ensuring that he is nearing the end of his
political career. His term expires in 2000.
	   In recent weeks, Yeltsin has ceded much of his day-to-day
authority to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.

Morocco announces perks for disputed region awaiting UN chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Morocco announcing housing, jobs; EDITS thruout &QL; 
 &UR; By ABDELHAKIM YAMANI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAAYOUNE, Western Sahara (AP) _ Hours before the arrival of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Morocco on Sunday announced plans for
new jobs and housing in this disputed territory it claims as part
of its kingdom but whose fate is to be decided by referendum.
	   Interior Minister Driss Basri said the ``royal directive'' from
King Hassan II includes plans to build 20,000 housing units and
provide 20,000 jobs for natives of the Western Sahara, known as
Sahraouis.
	   Addressing local officials, Basri said an additional 20,000
housing units would be built after the referendum -- now expected
in December 1999 -- to house those ``who return to their mother
country.''
	   He was referring to backers of the Polisario Front seeking
independence for the Western Sahara in bloody desert skirmishes
with Moroccan soldiers that endured for years.
	   Annan's trip here could serve as a leveler in the highly-charged
dispute over the future of the mineral-rich desert territory
claimed by Morocco since 1975, when Spain abandoned it.
	   The United Nations has pushed for seven years to organize a
referendum. Annan was to get a firsthand view of the U.N. military
observer team here, known as Minursa, organizing the referendum,
which has been delayed by differences over who can take part.
	   The U.N. chief was arriving from Mauritanian. He also is to
visit Morocco and Algeria, which once openly backed the Polisario
Front and harbors refugees in the Tindouf camp in southern Algeria.
	   Basri's announcement of plans to help Sahraouis was likely to
anger the Polisario.
	   Earlier Sunday, from Algeria, the Polisario Front said the
Western Sahara dispute will continue ``as long as long as the
Sahraoui people have not freely exercised their inalienable right
to independence, and done so in incontestable circumstances of
freedom and confidence.''
	   The U.N.'s referendum proposal was accepted by both sides in
1991, but critical differences over how to identify those eligible
have brought the process to a halt countless times.
	   Former U.S. Secretary of State James Baker was called in to
unblock the impasse.
	   Annan last month suggested the referendum, originally set for
December, be held in December 1999.
	   To date, 147,249 people have been declared eligible to take part
in the referendum. But another 65,000 are contested.
	   Annan's visit comes two days after Morocco celebrated the 23rd
anniversary of its so-called Green March on the Western Sahara
when, in 1975, hundreds of thousands of Moroccans marched into the
territory. Morocco has since poured millions of dollars into
developing the region.
	   The Moroccan monarch, marking the Green March in a speech
Friday, blamed the numerous delays in the referendum on ``the
maneuvers of our adversaries.''
	   But Hassan added that Morocco, like Kofi Annan, is ``armed with
patience.''
	   The last visit to the Western Sahara by a U.N. chief was in
November 1994, by Annan's predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

Central Americans dig out from hurricane damage, wait for aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 8 grafs to UPDATE with American Red Cross sending
aid to hardhit southern city of Choluteca Sunday morning &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMES ANDERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Central Americans battled to get
roads, water supplies and health care working again, to reach flood
victims and avoid the outbreak of diseases after the region was
battered by Hurricane Mitch.
	   Across flooded Central America, health authorities were warning
that diseases such as malaria and cholera could spread in the weeks
to come.
	   Twenty-five cases of cholera have been reported in Guatemala,
the Public Health Ministry there reported Friday. The Guatemalan
government has increased water-treatment efforts to prevent the
disease from spreading.
	   International relief flights delivered the first water
purification machines and needed medicines.
	   ``We have supplies, but everything is going very slowly. The
situation is very serious and there is a lot of concern there could
be many more deaths,'' Tom Turley of the Connecticut-based aid
group Americares said Saturday.
	   The American Red Cross on Sunday was sending enough food to
supply 1,000 families for one month in the southern Honduran city
of Choluteca, which was cut off from the rest of the country by
land until Saturday.
	   The shipments included rice, beans, vegetable oil, maize and
toohpaste.
	   ``The Honduran Red Cross is giving out all they have. Everything
incoming is absolutely necessary,'' said Ann Stingle, of the
American Red Cross. The American organiation was sending 40 tons of
water purification chemicals and antibiotics.

Flowers, engineer who cracked German codes, dies at 92
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Tommy Flowers, a British electronics engineer who
developed a vast, pioneering computer that cracked German military
communications in World War II, has died. He was 92.
	   Flowers' son Kenneth said Sunday that his father died from heart
failure at home in London on Oct. 28.
	   An engineering graduate of the University of London, Flowers
joined the British Post Office, then responsible for all national
communications, in the 30s and experimented in electronic telephone
transmissions.
	   In World War II, Flowers was sent to Bletchley Park, 50 miles
(80 kms) from London where mathematicians, cryptographers and other
experts worked on breaking Germany military codes.
	   Flowers secretly developed Colossus, a one-ton machine that
revolutionized the first part of decoding by pinpointing wheel
setting used by German operators for coded messages. The Germans
were using a then-sophisticated machine known as Lorenz.
	   ``Colossus had all the characteristics of the computer although
it wasn't thought of as a computer at the time,'' Kenneth Flowers
said in a telephone interview. ``It could think and made decisions.
Up to then these machines had been used just to make numerical
calculations.''
	   Flowers' breakthrough lay in devising an electronic machine to
do what had previously been done mechanically, his son said.
	   By the D-Day invasion of June 1944 Flowers had produced one more
Colossus which worked five times as fast as his original one. By
the end of the war in 1945, 10 machines were in operation.
	   Flowers received an honor, Member of the British Empire, for his
work in the 40s, but remained largely unknown to the wider public
because the work was kept secret until the 70s.
	   After the war, he returned to the Post Office and tried to
persuade his superiors to use technology to produce an
all-electronic phone system.
	   ``He spent 20 years trying to persuade them, but he wasn't so
successful because he couldn't tell them he had already produced
the machine,'' said Flowers' son.
	   Thomas Harold Flowers, who was born in London on Dec. 22, 1905,
did not tell his own family of his achievement, and the many lives
it saved, until long after the war.
	   ``He told us he worked on something secret and important,'' said
Flowers. ``They were allowed to tell that much in case their wives
wondered where they were. But until the 70s he never said anything
else. It was a point of honor really.''
	   Bletchley Park is now a tourist attraction with the German's
Lorenz machines on display and a replica of the Colossus, which
Flowers saw switched on by the Duke of Kent, a cousin of Queen
Elizabeth II, on June 6,1996.
	   Flowers is survived by his wife, Eileen, sons Kenneth and John,
and three grandchildren.
	   The funeral will be held Monday at Hendon Crematorium in north
London.

Minister indicates Italy might let stay more than 38,000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ After a week of melees involving illegal immigrants
seeking a limited number of work permits under a one-time offer,
Italy's interior minister has indicated Rome might let more people
stay after all.
	   ``Whoever meets the requirements of the law won't be expelled,''
Minister Rosa Russo Jervolino said in an interview published Sunday
in La Repubblica.
	   ``Just how those who go above the limit will be absorbed will be
studied in the next few days,'' she added.
	   There are an estimated 200,000-250,000 illegal immigrants in
Italy. Under an amnesty, immigrants have till Dec. 15 to apply for
some 38,000 permits that the government said will be granted to
those who can prove they have a job and have been in the country
since before March, when Italy tightened its rules on illegal
immigrants.
	   Rome promised its northern EU allies that it would expel all
those who don't have jobs in Italy or who aren't eligible for
political asylum. Many of the clandestine immigrants travel through
Italy to reach relatives or black-market jobs in northern Europe.
	   Last week, some immigrants fainted and others scuffled with
police after they waited in line for hours outside police stations
after authorities started taking applications on Nov. 4.
	   Paperwork has overwhelmed officials. Some immigrants who can't
prove they were in the country before March applied anyway, in
hopes they somehow would be allowed to stay.
	   At least 17,000 immigrants have come to Italy illegally since
the beginning of the year. Most are brought by smugglers in rickety
boats or take to motorized dinghies to cross the Adriatic between
Italy and Albania or the waters between Sicily and northern Africa.
	   On Saturday, more than 500 illegal immigrants turned up off the
coast of Puglia, in southeastern Italy. One of the boats had been
abandoned for days by smugglers.
	   Immigrants have been coming in waves for several years now,
making the journey on nights when seas are calm.

German conservatives choose new leader for post-Kohl era
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The conservative party that governed
Germany for 16 years appointed a new leader to replace Helmut Kohl
during a weekend congress, but made little progress in defining its
role in opposition to a center-left government.
	   Kohl, who stepped down as chairman of the Christian Democrats
after leading them to their worst defeat in postwar German
elections in September, warned his party to stay united.
	   ``Let us not give in to pressure to run after changing trends of
political fashion,'' Kohl said during a tearful farewell.
	   But younger members as well as special interest wings held in
check during his 25 years as party chief have long yearned for more
influence. They're getting their first chance to make policy _ and
are unlikely to give it up.
	   Kohl's hand-picked successor, Wolfgang Schaueble, 56, is charged
with modernizing the party's image. His ascent signals a shift
toward a more pro-market image for the party, but its overall
opposition strategy has not even begun to take shape.
	   ``We have a standpoint, but not a direction,'' one delegate
complained.
	   How well the party is able to shape itself in its new role will
be tested in a series of state elections next year, starting with
Hesse in February.
	   The rejuvenated leadership includes Christian Wulff, part of a
loose group of Kohl critics mostly in their 40s who are known as
``Wild Youth.''
	   Wulff, who recently said the party has ``wasted away,'' won a
vice chairman's post. The party's new general secretary, Angela
Merkel, is from eastern Germany.
	   Schaeuble pledged to renew the party into an opposition force
during his convention speech, chipping away at the 68-year-old
Kohl's strong legacy by making clear that the party had lost touch
with many voters.
	   A key task, he said, was regaining votes in economically
struggling eastern Germany, the formerly communist area where the
Christian Democrats were routed despite Kohl's image as ``father of
German unity.''
	   ``We must open up for new issues and thinking,'' Schaeuble
declared. ``The CDU must regain its ability to campaign.'' That
includes reaching out to labor unions and ecology-minded voters, he
said.
	   Considered a pro-market reformer, Schaeuble was Germany's most
popular politician in pre-election polls. A loyal Kohl protege who
suppressed his own yearning for the chancellorship, he has been in
a wheelchair since an apparently deranged man shot him during
campaigning in 1990.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government derided the Christian
Democrats' effort at renewal. ``The CDU is heading into the future
with its eyes on the past,'' said Greens party co-leader Gunda
Roestel.

Prince Charles pays tribute to British soldiers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ The Prince of Wales laid a wreath of
poppies and chrysanthemums in a Skopje graveyard Sunday in a
tribute to British solders fallen in the Balkan battlefields of
World War One.
	   Prince Charles arrived in this southern Balkan nation of two
million Sunday, the last stop of his four-nation, eight-day tour in
Eastern Europe.
	   The half-hour ceremony in a suburban Skopje graveyard Sunday,
where 120 British soldiers are buried, was led by a British army
chaplain and a Macedonian Orthodox priest.
	   After laying the wreath for the fallen British soldiers, the
prince left the capital to tour 15th and 16th century Orthodox
churches in southern Macedonia. The prince, who didn't speak to the
public Sunday, is accompanied by an entourage of British investors
and diplomats.
	   Also Sunday afternoon, the prince was briefed at the Skopje
office of the British Broadcasting Corporation on relations between
native Macedonians and the country's ethnic Albanian minority, who
make up about 23 percent of the total population.
	   Macedonia has remained peaceful in the last eight months, while
armed ethnic Albanian guerrillas in neighboring Yugoslavia fight
for independence of Kosovo province.
	   Prince Charles is scheduled to dine Sunday evening with
Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov.
	   On Monday, he will visit the internationally respected
Macedonian Institute of Earthquake Engineering and Seismology,
which was formed with Japanese help after a 1963 earthquake killed
1,071 Skopje residents and damaged 70 percent of the city's
buildings.
	   He's also scheduled to attend a ceremony to grant loans by the
British government to small and medium-sized businesses in
Macedonia.

<TEXT>
	   TRUJILLO, Honduras (AP) _ Flushed out of her village by
Hurricane Mitch's flood waters and drifting for six days far into
the Caribbean Sea, Laura Isabel Arriola de Guity was alone.
	   Her husband and three children were dead. All she had was a
makeshift raft, the sea below her, the sun in the day and the moon
at night. There was no land in sight.
	   On the sixth day, she spotted a duck near her raft.
	   ``I started to talk with this duck,'' she recalled. ``I said
'Little duck, send a message that I'm alive. Take me to my people.
Take me to the shore.''
	   ``I started crying and I said, 'Why don't you take me so that I
can fly somewhere with you?'''
	   Arriola's desperation ended hours later. She was spotted by an
airplane looking for a yacht that had disappeared during the storm.
A British helicopter rescued her.
	   Arriola, a 36-year-old school teacher, is recovering from
dehydration, sun exposure and hypothermia at a hospital in the
northern Honduran city of Trujillo. She is expected to be released
soon.
	   In an interview in her ward, Arriola tried in vain to told hold
back the tears as she described six days of terror and miracles,
surviving a storm officials say killed at least 10,000 people in
Central America.
	   Arriola and her family lived in the village of Barra de Aguan,
near the mouth of the Aguan River. Normally her house was about two
miles (three kilometers) from the sea on one side and more than a
mile (a kilometer and a half) from the river on the other. But when
Hurricane Mitch stalled over the Honduran coast Oct. 28, the sea
and the river merged into what seemed like a single body of water.
	   Arriola's house was quickly swept away, so her family took
refuge at a neighbor's home. Fourteen people climbed onto the roof,
but when a wall collapsed below, they returned downstairs.
	   They briefly found shelter in one room, but a wall there also
caved in and the river tore through the house. Arriola held on to
her 4-year-old son, Andersson Moises, and shouted at her husband
and brother-in-law to grab the other two children: Frances
Elizabeth, 8, and Ricardo Gerson, 10.
	   She tried to hold onto her son, but the river ripped them apart.
	   ``I tried to float so I could see over the water,'' she said.
``I swam and swam, trying to save him, trying to get to somewhere
dry. And then I realized I was already in the sea.''
	   She never saw her family again.
	   Arriola, a strong swimmer, clung to some floating palm branches
for four hours. Using debris in the water, she made a 4-foot by
4-foot (1.2-meter by 1.2-meter) raft out of tree roots, branches
and a mortar board.
	   ``I was thinking, I was begging God to let someone find me and
rescue me,'' she said. ``But there was no one. No one saw me''
	   Debris littered the sea. Arriola spotted the corpse of a child,
along with several dead animals. But she also found coconuts, which
gave her milk, as well as pineapples and oranges.
	   On the second day, she spotted two islands in the distance,
which she believed were Roatan and Utila _ about 100 miles (160
kilometers) from her home. But the sea and winds pushed her in the
other direction.
	   Arriola slept little. Rough seas made it difficult to rest and
she was knocked off the raft several times.
	   ``The worst part for me was after being with my whole family,
with my children, my husband, that I could be so alone in the sea
without seeing anybody,'' she said.
	   ``I cried every day. I was crying more than I was quiet. Day and
night I cried and screamed. I was praying, worshipping. I did it
all. The only thing I couldn't do was run, because there was no
place for me to run to.''
	   She passed time singing religious songs, talking to God and to
her husband and children.
	   ``I wasn't feeling so lonely when I was thinking of them as if
they were close to me.''
	   Her prayers bore fruit Nov. 2, when she saw a plane flying by
and waved at it. It turned and passed over her again.
	   ``I was trying to stand up on the raft, but a wave threw me in
the sea,'' she said.
	   She climbed back on the raft and took off her black T-shirt
because she thought her red bra might be more visible. The plane
passed again, this time dropping something in the water that
exploded. It was likely intended to mark the spot, but Arriola was
scared she was being bombed.
	   The plane descended and passed again. This time, she could see
two people inside who gestured toward her.
	   About a half hour later, she saw something in the air that she
thought was a bird. It turned out to be a British helicopter coming
to rescue her. A crewman was lowered to the raft, placed Arriola in
a harness and she was pulled on board.
	   ``I told him, thank God you have saved me. Thank God,'' she
said.
	   She said she doesn't know where she was picked up, but news
accounts said it was 25 miles (40 kilometers) north of Guanaja
Island _ about 75 miles (120 kilometers) from her home.
	   The crew members at first thought she might have been a survivor
of the Fantome, a Windjammer schooner apparently destroyed during
the storm with 31 crew members aboard.
	   She says she'll likely live with relatives after being
discharged. The bodies of her husband and daughter have been found.
The other two children are presumed dead.
	   Arriola is despondent about her future.
	   ``I have nothing. I have nowhere to go,'' she said.
	   ``I lost it all.''

Juventus lets 2-0 lead slip at Udine; Fiorentina retakes first
</HEADLINE>
place &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Juventus of Turin failed to protect a two-goal lead
against Udinese on Sunday and lost its lead in the Italian League
standings.
	   The two-time defending champion allowed Udinese's Argentine
striker Roberto Sosa, a substitute, to score in the third-minute of
injury time and had to settle for a 2-2 draw. That result dropped
Juventus into second place behind Fiorentina, which routed
last-place Venezia 4-1 as Gabriel Batistuta, the Argentine star,
tallied twice to raise his league-leading total to 10 goals after
eight games.
	   Fiorentina had lost two of its last three games to fall from the
top spot, but Batistuta scored in the 40th and 64th minutes to lead
his club, which was to learn later Sunday what its punishment will
be for last week's incident in which an explosive device was tossed
onto the field and forced suspension of a UEFA Cup match.
	   Fiorentina improved to 6-0-2 for 18 points, one ahead of
Juventus (5-2-1). AS Roma sits third with 14 points after a 1-1
draw at Bologna, a match marred by violent clashes between police
and hooligans that left at least a dozen people injured.
	   The match at Udinese started positively enough for Juventus, but
ended in disaster.
	   Zinedine Zidane, France's World Cup hero, hit the target for the
first time this season to give Juve the lead one minute before
halftime and Filippo Inzaghi made it 2-0 in the 49th. But
midfielder Jonathan Bachini headed in Belgian winger Johan Wlem's
cross in the 65th and Sosa turned home Brazilian striker Marcio
Amoroso's assist in the dying seconds to complete the rally.
	   Adding injury to insult, Juventus captain Alessandro Del Piero
was taken off the field on a stretcher late in the game with what
appeared to be a knee injury.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Lazio of Rome scored three goals, two by
defender Paolo Negro, in an eight-minute span of the first half en
route to a 4-1 win over Empoli; AC Parma was held to a 1-1 draw at
Bari; Japanese midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata scored one goal and set
up another to lead Perugia past Vicenza 3-1; Cagliari beat Piacenza
3-2, and Argentine striker Ariel Ortega's penalty kick lifted
Sampdoria of Genoa past Salernitana 1-0.
	   At night, Ronaldo's Internazionale of Milan aimed to halt a
three-game losing streak when it faced cross-city rival AC Milan.
	   At Florence, defender Pasquale Padalino opened the tally for the
hosts in the 22nd minute, but after Batistuta's first goal made it
2-0, Venezia (0-2-6) closed the gap on a penalty kick in the 42nd
by Stefan Schwoch, who has now scored his club's only two goals
this season.
	   Fiorentina then put the match away on back-to-back goals by
Portuguese playmaker Rui Costa, who scored from the penalty spot
after a Venezia defender was whistled for using his hand to stop a
cross, and Batistuta in the 62nd and 64th.

Report: Supermodel Moss in London clinic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Supermodel Kate Moss has checked into a London
clinic under an assumed name and is being treated for exhaustion,
The Mirror newspaper reported Saturday.
	   ``I've been doing a lot of hard work and too much partying,''
the tabloid quoted Ms. Moss, 24, as saying from The Priory, an
expensive private psychiatric clinic in Roehampton, southwest
London.
	   ``I wasn't happy with the way my life was going and so I decided
to take a step back and assess my life and future,'' The Mirror
quoted her as adding. ``I want to be totally responsible for
myself. And this is the place where I can get the peace and quiet
to start the process.''
	   The Mirror, under the headline ``Kate Moss Clinic Agony,''
quoted an unidentified ``source'' as saying that London-born Ms.
Moss has had a ``mini-collapse'' and expected to be out of the
clinic ``next week or so.''

Reports: Turkey sends troops into northern Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Turkish defense minister confirming operation &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey has sent into northern Iraq some
25,000 troops, backed by war planes and helicopters, to fight
Turkish Kurdish rebels, according to news reports Sunday.
	   Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin, currently on an official visit to
Bulgaria, confirmed that an operation was underway in northern Iraq
but denied that 25,000 troops had crossed the border.
	   ``It is not such a high-caliber operation,'' he said, without
specifying the number of troops.
	   ``The operation aims at eradicating members of the separatist
organization who fled from Syria into northern Iraq,'' Sezgin was
quoted as saying by the Anatolia news agency.
	   Sezgin said that Ankara had received information that up to 500
rebels had crossed into northern Iraq from Syria. Turkey pressured
Syria last month into ending its alleged support to the rebels.
	   In Brussels, Mizgin Sen, a spokeswoman for a Kurdish
organization that includes members of the rebel Kurdistan Worker's
Party (PKK) said that a Turkish military operation was underway to
secure the border before winter settles in.
	   Turkey recently stepped up its battle to end the 14-year-old war
by autonomy-seeking rebels.
	   The Turkish daily Hurriyet said the latest operation against
rebel hideouts began Thursday, with troops pushing some 30
kilometers (19 miles) inside Iraq.
	   Turkish troops have staged several such operations in northern
Iraq, which the PKK uses as a base to wage cross-border attacks on
Turkey.

Mandela's anointed successor denounces corruption in South Africa's
</HEADLINE>
government &QL; 
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Deputy President Thabo Mbeki lashed
out at government corruption, charging that some people took jobs
with the sole aim of stealing.
	   Speaking on Saturday in the Eastern Cape town of Butterworth,
Mbeki sounded the ruling party's tone on a theme expected to be a
major 1999 election issue.
	   Mbeki is the anointed successor to President Nelson Mandela, 80,
who is retiring next year.
	   ``Sitting in government there are sophisticated thieves,
continuously seeking ways to misdirect public resources away from
the people to themselves,'' Mbeki said. ``We know who they are.''
	   The African National Congress government plans a conference on
Tuesday and Wednesday to lay the groundwork for a major
anti-corruption summit in February, just months before the
election.
	   No election date has been set, but it is expected to be after
April 1999.
	   Mbeki's outburst against corruption was triggered in part by
piles of garbage placed as a political protest along the road into
Butterworth.
	   The litter, which forced his car to the wrong side of the
street, was strewn by community organizations demanding the
resignation of elected town officials charged with theft of public
money.
	   After two years of investigation, a special government
commission chaired by Judge William Heath has uncovered 92,600
cases of corruption involving losses of more than 6.2 billion rand
(dlrs 1.1 billion).
	   About 640 million rand (dlrs 114 million) has been recovered by
the unit.
	   Last month, in a speech at a voter registration drive campaign
in Johannesburg, Mandela chastised officials in the post-1994
government who stole public funds.
	   ``When we took over in 1994, little did we know that some of our
own people would be as corrupt as the apartheid government,'' he
said.
	   Mbeki succeeded Mandela as head of the ANC in December.
	   White minority rule ended in 1994 with the country's first
all-race election.

German terrorist suspect reportedly killed in Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The Foreign Ministry said Sunday it is
investigating reports that Turkish troops killed a captured German
terrorist suspect who had been fighting alongside Kurdish
guerrillas.
	   The ministry said it asked Turkey for an explanation after two
newsmagazines reported the death of Andrea Wolf, 33, in
southeastern Turkey.
	   Der Spiegel, citing witnesses and other guerrillas, said she was
``liquidated'' by Turkish soldiers on Oct. 24. Focus magazine, in a
similar report, said she had been captured in late September.
	   German police have sought Wolf as a suspect in the 1993 bombing
of a prison by the left-wing Red Army Faction.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The conservative party that governed
Germany for 16 years appointed a new leader to replace Helmut Kohl
during a weekend congress, but made little progress in defining its
role in opposition to a center-left government.
	   Kohl, who stepped down as chairman of the Christian Democrats
after leading them to their worst defeat in postwar German
elections in September, warned his party to stay united.
	   ``Let us not give in to pressure to run after changing trends of
political fashion,'' Kohl said during a tearful farewell at
Saturday's convention.

African leaders meet to discuss Ethiopia Eritrea Dispute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ After meeting with the leaders
of Eritrea and Ethiopia over their six-month border dispute,
African mediators Sunday were discussing the chances for peace in
the region.
	   It was not clear if any agreement had been reached as the
two-day talks moved toward their final hours.
	   The mediators _ Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore,
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Djibouti's President Hassan
Ghouled Aptidon _ met earlier Sunday with Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi of Ethiopia and Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki.
	   Isaias declined to comment, but Zenawi hinted that the
mediators, appointed by the Organization of African Unity, may be
taking his side.
	   ``The OAU ... has been sticking to its charter that the
principles of aggression cannot be rewarded,'' Zenawi told
reporters. He declined further comment.
	   On Saturday, Zenawi warned neighboring Eritrea that their feud
will continue unless Eritrea withdraws from disputed territory.
	   Isaias and Zenawi also met with the mediators in separate
discussions Saturday.
	   OAU secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim is also attending the
meetings, along with U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun.
	   Mediation efforts so far have failed to resolve the dispute.
Ethiopian officials have said they are committed to a U.S.-Rwanda
peace proposal forwarded earlier this year, which requires that
both sides withdraw to positions held before hostilities broke out
in May.
	   Eritrea, however, has rejected that proposal. Isaias, speaking
Thursday before departing for the talks, said the only way to end
the conflict was to declare a ceasefire and then demarcate the
common border.
	   After a lull in fighting between the two Horn of Africa nations,
sporadic fighting erupted over the past two weeks. Earlier this
week, two Ethiopian towns were reportedly shelled, with at least
nine people killed in one of them.
	   Several hundred people have been killed during the six months of
the dispute.
	   Eritrea fought a 30-year war against Ethiopia and was granted
independence in 1993, but the border between the two countries has
never been officially demarcated.

Latest dispute over accord's provisions centers on radical groups
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES in grafs 4-5 with Israeli searches for Islamic
Jihad; Quote from speaker of Palestinian council graf 14-15, TRIMS;

 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Setting the stage for a new quarrel over how to
crack down on militants, Israel is demanding that the military
wings of two radical Islamic groups be outlawed, while the
Palestinian Authority insists it has already banned them.
	   Implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security
accord, signed Oct. 23 in Washington, was to have begun this past
week, but has hit various snags.
	   Most recently, Israel's Cabinet put off a vote to ratify the
accord after a suicide bombing Friday in Jerusalem that killed the
two assailants and injured 21 Israelis. The radical group Islamic
Jihad claimed responsibility.
	   Sunday, the Israeli army set-up roadblocks, forbid residents
from leaving their homes for several hours and carried out searches
in the West Bank village of Kabatiya for a leader of the militant
group.
	   The Israeli army said troops had fired towards a fleeing
terrorist suspect there and soldiers found a pistol and fake
Israeli identification cards in the suspect's abandoned car.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said Sunday that Israel expects Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to formally outlaw the military wings of Islamic
Jihad and the larger militant group Hamas.
	   Hassan Asfour, a senior Palestinian official, said Hamas'
military wing, Izeddine al Qassam, and the military wing of Islamic
Jihad were outlawed by the Palestinian Authority in 1996. But
Bar-Illan said the Palestinian legislature had never passed such a
law.
	   The Wye memorandum states that the Palestinian Authority ``will
inform the United States fully of the actions it has taken to
outlaw all organizations (or wings of organizations, as
appropriate) of a military, terrorist or violent character, and
their support structure and to prevent them freedom of action in
the areas under its jurisdiction.''
	   A Palestinian security official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a joint meeting of Israeli and Palestinian security
officials was held Saturday night to discuss security in the wake
of Friday's attack.
	   The idea of outlawing Hamas and Islamic Jihad was brought up in
the meeting and also proposed by Netanyahu to Arafat during a phone
call, the official said.
	   The Palestinians said they could ban activity by Hamas or
Islamic Jihad that endangered either Israelis or Palestinians, but
could not outlaw them outright as political movements.
	   Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council
said Israel had no right to hinge implementation of the agreement
on outlawing the terrorist groups.
	   ``It's not up to them to decide,'' he said.
	   Friday's bombing led to finger-pointing by both sides. Israel
said it showed Arafat's crackdown on terrorists had not been
sweeping enough.
	   The Palestinians, however, have also accused Israel of failing
to take at least partial security responsibility for the attack,
because both attackers came from Israeli-controlled areas, and had
recently served time in Israeli jails.
	   Israel as a rule is harshly critical of the Palestinian
Authority's security efforts when attackers come from
Palestinian-controlled areas or have been released from Palestinian
prisons.
	   On Sunday, Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu-Medein accused
Netanyahu of using the blast as a pretext for delaying
implementation of the peace accord.
	   ``This attack is a gift to Mr. Netanyahu,'' Abu-Medein said.
``All the time he is praying to God to help him ... to escape from
the agreement.''
	   Under the accord, Israel is to hand over another 13 percent of
the territory in the West Bank to the Palestinians in exchange for
various security steps.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai predicted Sunday that
the Israeli Cabinet would ratify the agreement in coming days. ``I
estimate that the government will meet this week and will accept
the decision of the majority (in favor of the agreement),'' he
said.

 &UR; Udinese 2, Juventus 2 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   At Udine, like both of his goals in France's final win over
Brazil in July, Zidane tallied with a header, squeezing defender
Alessandro Birindelli's cross between 'keeper Luigi Turci and the
near post from close range. Inzaghi then hit his fifth goal of the
season by deflecting in a shot by teammate Alessio Tacchinardi.
	   But while Juve's weak point so far has been offense, this time
its defense let the club down, allowing both Bachini and Sosa to
break free for their goals. Udinese is 2-4-2.
 &UR; Bologna 1, Roma 1 &QC; 
	   At Bologna, Brazilian forward Paulo Sergio put Roma (4-2-2)
ahead in the 15th minute, but the hosts (2-4-2) tied it just two
minutes later on Giuseppe Signori's solo run and held on for the
draw despite defender Giovanni Bia's expulsion with a half-hour
left to play. Roma has won all four of its home games but is 0-2-2
on the road.
 &UR; Lazio 4, Empoli 1 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Negro _ playing just his second game of the season

	   CARACAS, Venezuela _ Nationwide elections Sunday are for
governors and congressmen, but Venezuelans were also deciding the
political fortunes of a failed coup leader running for president on
an anti-corruption, anti-establishment platform.
	   Supported by millions of peasants and shantytown dwellers, a new
movement led by Hugo Chavez, who took up arms against the
government six years ago, appears poised for a strong showing in
Sunday's congressional vote.
	   With Venezuelan politics taking on overtones of class warfare,
officials fear an outbreak of violence. They dispatched about
100,000 soldiers and policemen to ensure peaceful voting, expelled
the local election board in the country's second most populous
state, and prohibited the sale of liquor and the carrying of
weapons.
	   President Rafael Caldera, whose army chief recently implied the
armed forces would seek to block Chavez's rise to power, cast his
ballot and declared the vote ``an expression of the will of the
people.''
	   In a country where fraud allegations often surround elections,
Caldera promised the results would be ``respected completely and in
a transparent, clean and honest way.''
	   About 11 million of Venezuela's 23 million inhabitants are
eligible to vote, and by midday Sunday, turnout looked strong.
	   In a front-page plea to its readers, the Caracas newspaper El
Universal tried to calm tensions.
	   ``We call for serenity, balance and strict respect for the
electoral results, as an expression of a sacred social pact,'' it
said.
	   Despite the surging popularity of Chavez's Patriotic Pole
coalition, Venezuela's two oldest parties _ the center-left
Democratic Action Party and the conservative Copei Party _ could
benefit from well-greased political machines bringing out the vote
Sunday for 23 governors, 48 senators, 189 members of congress and
391 state assembly members.
	   Yet polls show Chavez leading the Dec. 6 race for president, and
Patriotic Pole stands a good chance of winning the largest share of
Venezuela's bicameral congress, which is currently dominated by
Copei and Democratic Action.
	   ``I am optimistic because the people are alert, with their eyes
wide open,'' said Chavez as he voted Sunday amid shouts of ``Hugo!
Hugo!''
	   President Caldera's party, Convergence, which broke away from
Copei five years ago, is not expected to be a major player in these
elections.
	   The traditional parties are expected to do better in the
gubernatorial races, where many of the candidates are incumbents
who have spent years handing out political favors.
	   Some of the candidates running on Chavez's ticket are former
army officers who participated in his 1992 coup attempt against
then President Carlos Andres Perez.
	   Perez is himself running for senate while under house arrest in
his home state of Tachira pending charges of illegal enrichment. If
he wins as expected, he will receive parliamentary immunity and be
freed.
	   Many people blame Copei and Democratic Action for the country's
declining living standards and for squandering Venezuela's vast oil
wealth.
	   ``Chavez is the antithesis of the democratic decay this country
has had,'' said Ivan Hernandez, a 52-year-old high school teacher
who said he is voting for Patriotic Pole.

Yeltsin back from vacation earlier than expected
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Updates thruout with Yeltsin spokesman saying president
healthy, meetings still planned. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin unexpectedly returned to
Moscow late Sunday, nearly a week before he was scheduled to end
his medically mandated vacation in the southern resort town of
Sochi, his press service said.
	   Kremlin spokeswoman Vera Barysheva declined to comment on why
the president had come back earlier than expected. When Yeltsin
went to Sochi on Oct. 30, just over a week ago, the Kremlin had
said he would be there two weeks, recuperating from exhaustion.
	   His spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin, told Echo Moscow radio that
Yeltsin was feeling well, and closely following events. ``Boris
Nikolayevich's state of health is normal. He is in a good mood,''
Yakushkin said.
	   In recent months, the 67-year-old Yeltsin has steadily receded
from public view, taking frequent vacations and periodically
checking into government rest homes or sanitariums.
	   He has been described as suffering from nothing worse than bad
colds or, in the latest case, exhaustion. Public skepticism is
growing, and Communists in the lower house of parliament _ who had
first-hand experience hiding leaders' ailments in the Soviet period
_ have begun to demand a full accounting of his physical condition.
	   Russia's Supreme Court ruled last week that Yeltsin cannot seek
a third term in office, ensuring that he is nearing the end of his
political career. His term expires in 2000.
	   In recent weeks, Yeltsin has ceded much of his day-to-day
authority to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   However, Yakushkin stressed that Yeltsin still has a heavy
schedule he intends to fulfill for the rest of November, including
meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro of
Italy and Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands.

Rusedski beats Sampras in straight sets

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Finishing it off with an ace, Britain's Greg
Rusedski played three inspired sets of serve-and-volley tennis
Sunday to beat World No. 1 Pete Sampras 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 and win
the dlrs 2.55 million Paris Open.
	   The 13th-seeded Rusedski slammed 18 aces during his surprise
victory, but also volleyed beautifully and hit laser-sharp
groundstrokes. It was the first time he had beaten Sampras after
six losses.
	   Sampras, although not showing any visible effects of a back
injury earlier in the week, clearly was not at top form _
especially in the third set. He double-faulted six times during the
match.
	   ``It was a magical match for me,'' Rusedski said. ``I've never
beaten the world's No. 1 before.''
	   ``Greg was just too good today,'' Sampras said.
	   Yet both the first and second sets were tight ones. In the
first, the players held serve until the ninth game, when Sampras
double-faulted on break point, giving Rusedski a 5-4 lead. The
Briton closed out the set with two aces.
	   In the second set, Sampras blew four break points in the second
game. That proved crucial. The set went to a tiebreaker, which
Rusedski won 7-4 when Sampras hit the final ball into the net.
	   In the third, Sampras flagged. Rusedski broke him for 2-0, and
the American never recovered, despite playing a great game to hold
at 5-3.
	   Rusedski rolled to a 40-0 lead in the final game, then hit an
ace and jumped in the air, fists pumping.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Juventus of Turin failed to protect a two-goal lead
against Udinese on Sunday and lost its lead in the Italian League
standings.
	   The two-time defending champion allowed Udinese's Argentine
striker Roberto Sosa, a substitute, to score in the third-minute of
injury time and had to settle for a 2-2 draw. That result dropped
Juventus into second place behind Fiorentina, which routed
last-place Venezia 4-1 as Gabriel Batistuta, the Argentine star,
tallied twice to raise his league-leading total to 10 goals after
eight games.
	   Fiorentina had lost two of its last three games to fall from the
top spot, but Batistuta scored in the 40th and 64th minutes to lead
his club, which was to learn later Sunday what its punishment will
be for last week's incident in which an explosive device was tossed
onto the field and forced suspension of a UEFA Cup match.
	   Fiorentina improved to 6-0-2 for 18 points, one ahead of
Juventus (5-2-1). AS Roma sits third with 14 points after a 1-1
draw at Bologna, a match marred by pre-kickoff violent clashes
involving police and rival hooligans that left at least a dozen
people injured. Two people were stabbed, but the wounds were not
serious, RAI state TV said.
	   The match at Udinese started positively enough for Juventus, but
ended in disaster.
	   Zinedine Zidane, France's World Cup hero, hit the target for the
first time this season to give Juve the lead one minute before
halftime and Filippo Inzaghi made it 2-0 in the 49th. But
midfielder Jonathan Bachini headed in Belgian winger Johan Walem's
cross in the 65th and Sosa turned home Brazilian striker Marcio
Amoroso's assist in the dying seconds to complete the rally.
	   Adding injury to insult, Juventus captain Alessandro Del Piero
was taken off the field on a stretcher late in the game with what
appeared to be a knee injury.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Lazio of Rome scored three goals, two by
defender Paolo Negro, in an eight-minute span of the first half en
route to a 4-1 win over Empoli; AC Parma was held to a 1-1 draw at
Bari; Japanese midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata scored one goal and set
up another to lead Perugia past Vicenza 3-1; Cagliari beat Piacenza
3-2, and Argentine striker Ariel Ortega's penalty kick lifted
Sampdoria of Genoa past Salernitana 1-0.
	   At night, Ronaldo's Internazionale of Milan aimed to halt a
three-game losing streak when it faced cross-city rival AC Milan.
	   At Florence, defender Pasquale Padalino opened the tally for the
hosts in the 22nd minute, but after Batistuta's first goal made it
2-0, Venezia (0-2-6) closed the gap on a penalty kick in the 42nd
by Stefan Schwoch, who has now scored his club's only two goals
this season.
	   Fiorentina then put the match away on back-to-back goals by
Portuguese playmaker Rui Costa, who scored from the penalty spot
after a Venezia defender was whistled for using his hand to stop a
cross, and Batistuta in the 62nd and 64th.
 &UR; Udinese 2, Juventus 2 &QC; 
	   At Udine, like both of his goals in France's final win over
Brazil in July, Zidane tallied with a header, squeezing defender
Alessandro Birindelli's cross between 'keeper Luigi Turci and the
near post from close range. Inzaghi then hit his fifth goal of the
season by deflecting in a shot by teammate Alessio Tacchinardi.
	   But while Juve's weak point so far has been offense, this time
its defense let the club down, allowing both Bachini and Sosa to
break free for their goals. Udinese is 2-4-2.
 &UR; Bologna 1, Roma 1 &QC; 
	   At Bologna, Brazilian forward Paulo Sergio put Roma (4-2-2)
ahead in the 15th minute, but the hosts (2-4-2) tied it just two
minutes later on Giuseppe Signori's solo run and held on for the
draw despite defender Giovanni Bia's expulsion with a half-hour
left to play. Roma has won all four of its home games but is 0-2-2
on the road.
 &UR; Lazio 4, Empoli 1 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Negro _ playing just his second game of the season
after a long injury absence _ scored in the 22nd and 26th minutes
and Chilean striker Marcelo Salas stole the ball and deposited it
in the net in the 30th as Lazio (3-4-1) rebounded from last week's
shocking loss to Salernitana. Marco Carparelli scored a meaningless
goal for Empoli (1-3-4) with nine minutes remaining.
 &UR; Bari 1, Parma 1 &QC; 
	   At Bari, South African striker Phil Masinga was left unmarked on
a corner kick and slammed the equalizer home with 14 minutes left
for Bari (2-5-1). Parma (3-4-1) had taken the lead on midfielder
Diego Fuser's goal on the stroke of halftime. Fuser and Bari's
Moroccan defender Rachid Neqrouz were sent off in the second half
for fighting.
 &UR; Perugia 3, Vicenza 1 &QC; 
	   At Perugia, Croat midfielder Milan Rapajic's header gave the
hosts (3-2-3) the lead after 26 minutes, but Vicenza winger
Gabriele Ambrosetti tied the game at the half-hour mark. Nakata
then scored from the penalty spot in the 52nd for his fourth goal
of the year and set up Alessandro Melli's goal in the 75th. Vicenza
is 2-3-3.
 &UR; Cagliari 3, Piacenza 2 &QC; 
	   At Cagliari, Roberto Muzzi scored two goals, including the
winner in the 61st minute, to pace the Sardinians (3-2-3). Piacenza
fell to 2-2-4.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ As U.S. officials studied a possible
military strike against Iraq, Iraqi ministers said Sunday they were
not afraid of American attacks and would not back down on barring
U.N. arms inspections.
	   Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said Iraq has suffered for
so long under U.N. sanctions that have crippled the country that it
has nothing to fear from new U.S. threats.
	   ``They will not kill in a military strike more than they are
killing with sanctions every day,'' Saleh said, referring to U.N.
Security Council trade sanctions imposed on Iraq since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``Our country is prepared to face any military aggression,'' he
said.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz also told the official Iraqi
News Agency that the government was not moved by a U.N. Security
Council resolution last week holding it in ``flagrant violation''
of U.N. edicts.
	   ``Iraq adheres to its stance until the Security Council fulfills
its obligation toward Iraq,'' INA quoted Aziz as saying. This, he
said, involved lifting the U.N. ban on oil sales ``as a start
toward the final lifting of the whole embargo.''
	   Iraq last month announced it was halting cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors until the Security Council begins moving to lift
the embargo, which has devastated Iraq's economy.
	   The Security Council has said the embargo won't be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction, as required by U.N. resolutions that ended the
1991 Gulf War over the Kuwait occupation.
	   Iraq says the sanctions, which prevent almost all trade with
Iraq, have led to the deaths of 1.5 million Iraqis in the past
eight years _ many of them children _ by causing shortages of food
and medicine and a deterioration of water and sewage systems.
	   ``We are losing 4,500 children per month _ that means nearly
60,000 per year,'' Saleh said. ``I don't think a military strike
would kill 60,000 children as sanctions are killing now.''
	   Aziz, the most senior Iraqi official to react to the latest U.N.
resolution, spoke after meeting a delegation of Irish and Scottish
politicians who said they opposed the use of force against Iraq.
	   ``I think nothing is solved by military action,'' said Tam
Dalyell, a Scottish member of the British Parliament who
accompanied Reynolds. ``It just creates a bitterness between old
friends that I deplore.''
	   Dalyell said the delegation's leader, former Irish Prime
Minister Albert Reynolds, planned to brief U.S. President Bill
Clinton about his findings in Baghdad, adding: ``I hope it does
some good.''
	   The United States and Britain have threatened possible military
action to force Baghdad to allow U.N. weapons inspections to
resume.
	   On Sunday, Clinton was meeting with Defense Secretary William
Cohen, who just completed a tour of the Gulf, and National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger, who consulted last week with Britain and
France.
	   Iraq's decision to halt inspections is aimed at the U.N. Special
Commission, which is charged with eliminating Iraq's biological and
chemical weapons as well as long-range missiles.
	   The Iraqi ban exempts monitors from the Vienna-headquartered
International Atomic Energy Agency. On Sunday, two nuclear
monitoring teams went into the field, U.N. officials said.

 &UR; German leader marks night of Nazi terror &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, marking
Monday's 60th anniversary of a Nazi night of terror against Jews,
urged his compatriots never to forget but also to look to the
future.
	   Nazi thugs torched hundreds of synagogues, looted thousands of
Jewish businesses and attacked Jews in Germany and Austria on Nov.
9, 1938 in what is known as Kristallnacht, or the Night of Broken
Glass.
	   The rampage, less than a year before World War II, was in
reprisal for the shooting of a German diplomat in Paris by a young
Jew.
	   Schroeder called it ``a truly fateful day for Germany that
stands for unprecedented crimes, a date that remains linked forever
with the remembrance of immense suffering.''
	   ``Sixty years later we look forward, without forgetting the
past,'' said Schroeder, who is Germany's first chancellor with no
personal memory of World War II.
	   Germany's postwar democracy is solid enough that people keep ``a
critical distance to extreme-right slogans,'' he said.
	   To keep it that way, he said, his government would fight
joblessness. Mass unemployment and economic turmoil are seen as key
reasons for the rise of the Nazis in the 1920 and '30s.
	   ``Our task is to shape the present and the future, so the past
cannot repeat itself,'' said Schroeder, a Social Democrat who won
September elections.

Juventus, Italy star injures knee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UDINE, Italy (AP) _ Italy international striker Alessandro Del
Piero hyperextended his left knee late in his Serie A club Juventus
of Turin's 2-2 draw Sunday at Udinese.
	   Club doctor Riccardo Agricola said it was not immediately clear
how long the Juventus captain will be sidelined. ``The good news is
that the knee is not swollen,'' Agricola said. ``But the back of
the knee hurts a lot.''
	   Del Piero was taken off the field at Friuli Stadium on a
stretcher after clashing with Udinese defender Valerio Bertotto in
the closing minutes.
	   It is the latest setback for Del Piero, who turns 24 Monday. The
player struggled through a poor World Cup this summer with a leg
injury and has tallied only twice this season for Juventus, which
tumbled out of first place in the league standings with Sunday's
draw.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Juventus of Turin failed to protect a two-goal lead
against Udinese on Sunday and lost its lead in the Italian League
standings.
	   The two-time defending champion allowed Udinese's Argentine
striker Roberto Sosa, a substitute, to score in the third-minute of
injury time and had to settle for a 2-2 draw. That result dropped
Juventus into second place behind Fiorentina, which routed
last-place Venezia 4-1 as Gabriel Batistuta, the Argentine star,
tallied twice to raise his league-leading total to 10 goals after
eight games.
	   Fiorentina had lost two of its last three games to fall from the
top spot, but Batistuta scored in the 40th and 64th minutes to lead
his club, which was to learn later Sunday what its punishment will
be for last week's incident in which an explosive device was tossed
onto the field and forced suspension of a UEFA Cup match.
	   Fiorentina improved to 6-0-2 for 18 points, one ahead of
Juventus (5-2-1). AS Roma sits third with 14 points after a 1-1
draw at Bologna, a match marred by pre-kickoff violent clashes
involving police and rival hooligans that left at least a dozen
people injured. Two people were stabbed, but the wounds were not
serious, RAI state TV said.
	   The match at Udinese started positively enough for Juventus, but
ended in disaster.
	   Zinedine Zidane, France's World Cup hero, hit the target for the
first time this season to give Juve the lead one minute before
halftime and Filippo Inzaghi made it 2-0 in the 49th. But
midfielder Jonathan Bachini headed in Belgian winger Johan Walem's
cross in the 65th and Sosa turned home Brazilian striker Marcio
Amoroso's assist in the dying seconds to complete the rally.
	   Adding injury to insult, Juventus captain Alessandro Del Piero
was taken off the field on a stretcher late in the game with a
hyperextended left knee. The striker, who turns 24 Monday, was
injured in a clash with Udinese defender Valerio Bertotto, and club
doctor Riccardo Agricola said it was not immediately clear who long
Del Piero will be out of action.

Patriarch apologizes to mistreated saint
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AEGINA, Greece (AP) _ A Christian Orthodox saint praised for
honesty and charity received a posthumous apology Sunday for his
mistreatment at the hands of malicious rivals.
	   Patriarch Peter VII of Alexandria, who oversees the Orthodox
flock in Africa, said top clergymen felt it was time to formally
clear the reputation of Saint Nectarios 78 years after his death on
Aegina, an island about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southwest of
Athens.
	   ``This was an obligation that we had to fulfill, to issue and
apology to the saint for his expulsion by our predecessors,'' the
patriarch told followers during a visit to Aegina, where Nectarios
is the patron saint. The island celebrates a holy day for Nectarios
on Monday.
	   Nectarios was elected to the senior church rank of metropolitan
bishop of a Greek community in Egypt in 1889 only to be expelled
the following year. It is believed that jealous clergymen falsely
accused him of plotting to oust the patriarch and seek the position
for himself.
	   The decision to apologize was taken by the governing body, or
Holy Synod, of the Orthodox Church of Alexandria on Egypt's
Mediterranean coast. Nectarios was elevated to sainthood in 1961,
but the Synod apparently considered a formal apology was still
necessary.
	   Nectarios was born into a humble family in what is now European
Turkey and dedicated his life to teaching and helping the poor.
After his expulsion from the position in Egypt, he traveled around
Greece and parts of the then Ottoman Empire.
	   It is not uncommon for churches to apologize for their actions
decades, or even centuries, after the event. The Roman Catholic
Church is currently weighing an apology for the Inquisition and its
centuries-long campaign against heresy in which thousands _ and
perhaps millions _ were tried, tortured and burned at the stake for
their beliefs.
	   Peter VII, installed as patriarch last year, is the spiritual
leader of the dwindling Greek Orthodox community of about 100,000
people in Africa, mainly in Alexandria and South Africa.

Poll: Most Britons believe nation will join single currency
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Though Britons remain sharply divided on the
wisdom of joining a European single currency, most believe that the
nation will sign up eventually, according to a poll published
Sunday.
	   An NOP poll commissioned by The Express on Sunday newspaper
found that 35 percent favored membership and 41 percent were
opposed. In a similar poll conducted by Gallup seven years ago, the
newspaper said 63 percent were opposed.
	   Of those opposed, 36 percent said they were open to changing
their minds if the currency proves to be successful, while 54
percent said they would still be opposed.
	   Some 86 percent of the respondents believed Britain will
``probably join one day,'' and 54 percent believed Britain would be
forced to join to avoid being left behind other European Union
nations.
	   The poll was based on interviews with 1,034 adults on Nov. 6,
and had a margin of error of about three percentage points.

Vajpayee says India will not compromise on security
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The partial waiving of sanctions by
Washington shows that the world is beginning to understand India's
security interests, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said
Sunday, domestic news agencies reported.
	   ``We will not submit to pressures from nuclear superpowers and
will make no compromise on security matters,'' Vajpayee said at a
public gathering in eastern India according to the Press Trust of
India.
	   On Friday, Washington announced some sanctions against India and
Pakistan would be lifted as a result of progress made by the two
countries in curbing their nuclear weapons programs. The two
countries were subjected to a series of sanctions last spring after
they carried out nuclear tests.
	   In addition, the United States started a series of talks aimed
primarily at getting the two countries to sign an international
nuclear test ban treaty.
	   But India has resisted such efforts saying it was forced to
conduct the tests because of a growing threat to its security.
	   However, India has said it advocates nuclear disarmament and
would be willing to do so if other countries agreed to eliminate
weapons of mass destruction.
	   For months, Indian leaders have said the sanctions hurt American
business interests more than India, a country which has a large but
isolated economy.

Rusedski beats Sampras in straight sets

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Finishing it off with an ace, Britain's Greg
Rusedski played three inspired sets of serve-and-volley tennis
Sunday to beat World No. 1 Pete Sampras 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 and win
the dlrs 2.55 million Paris Open.
	   The 13th-seeded Rusedski slammed 18 aces during his surprise
victory, but also volleyed well, hit laser-sharp passing shots and
returned beautifully.
	   It was the first time he had beaten Sampras in seven meetings.
	   ``It was a magical match for me,'' Rusedski said. ``I've never
beaten the world's No. 1 before. It's definitely the biggest match
of my career.''
	   Sampras, the defending champion here, didn't show any visible
effects of a back injury earlier in the week. But he was not at top
form _ especially in the third set. He double-faulted six times
during the match.
	   ``Greg was just too good today,'' Sampras said. ``My back was
fine. He just basically outplayed me.
	   ``I'm kind of kicking myself a bit.''
	   Yet both the first and second sets were tight ones. In the
first, the players held serve until the ninth game, when Sampras
double-faulted on break point, giving Rusedski a 5-4 lead. The
Briton closed out the set with two aces.
	   In the second, Sampras blew four break points in the second
game. He eventually did break Rusedski for a 4-2 lead, exulting
with pumped fists, but at 5-4, serving for the set, he allowed
Rusedski to break him _ again on a double-fault. The set went to a
tightly fought tiebreaker, which Rusedski won 7-4 when Sampras hit
into the net.
	   In the third set, Sampras flagged, looking defeated. Rusedski
broke him for 2-0, and the American never recovered, despite
playing a great service game to hold at 5-3 and get the fans
cheering again.
	   Rusedski rolled to a 40-0 lead in the final game, then hit an
ace and jumped in the air, arms pumping.
	   ``He's pretty much kicked everyone's butt all week,'' a subdued
Sampras said. ``My hat's off to him.''
	   ``When he's hot, he's pretty tough.''
	   Rusedski, ranked 13th in the world, was playing in the Paris
Open for the second time; last year he reached the quarterfinals.
He is also looking to qualify for the ATP World Championships in
Hanover for the second year. Last year, he was the first British
player to qualify.
	   Sampras is seeking to finish the year at No. 1 for the sixth

Ten days after devastating fire, grief and unanswered questions

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ Grief and unanswered questions still
gripped Sweden's second-largest city Sunday, 10 days after a fire
killed 63 young people when it raced through an upstairs dance
hall.
	   As they have done every day since the fire broke out just before
midnight on Oct. 29, crowds came to the fire site to grieve and
ponder and gaze at the flowers, candles and messages laid in the
parking lot outside the building.
	   And as they have done every day, local authorities held a news
conference, saying they had not determined the cause of the blaze.
	   The fire's explosive spread and the fact that it blocked one of
the second-floor hall's two exit stairways has prompted speculation
that it was arson, and because most of the victims were immigrants
or children of immigrants there have been persistent suspicions
that anti-foreigner sentiment is at the root of Sweden's worst fire
catastrophe.
	   ''Nothing leads us to believe that this is an attempted attack.
But nothing leads us to believe it was due to natural causes,''
said Rolf Johansson, technical chief of the investigation.
	   Johansson said the investigation of the cause is proceeding
slowly because much of the 400-square-meter (4,400-square-foot)
hall is covered with debris up to 50 centimeters (20 inches) thick.
	   The slowness of the investigation apparently has aggravated many
who lost relatives and friends in the blaze. Iranian immigrants
have formed a group to conduct an independent investigation of the
fire.
	   The local center for Sunni Muslims has formed a crisis team of
about 20 people to talk with young mourners at the fire site and at
other places in the city where impromptu memorials have appeared.
	   ''One of our purposes is to prevent conflicts between ethnic
groups from rising up. There is also among certain youths a charged
attitude toward the police,'' group leader Taha Abdu said,
according to the Swedish news agency TT.
	   Anonymous fliers claiming ''Nazis took our children'' also have
appeared in the city. Hans Carlsson, spokesman for the Goteborg
police, said the origin of the fliers has not been determined.
	   About 160 other people were injured in the fire, of whom 26
remained in hospitals in Sweden and Norway on Sunday, officials
said.

Latest dispute over accord's provisions centers on radical groups
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 4-5 with Israeli searches for Islamic Jihad;
Quote from speaker of Palestinian council graf 14, TRIMS; CHANGES
Byline &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Setting the stage for a new quarrel over how to
crack down on militants, Israel is demanding that the military
wings of two radical Islamic groups be outlawed, while the
Palestinian Authority insists it has already banned them.
	   Implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security
accord, signed Oct. 23 in Washington, was to have begun this past
week, but has hit various snags.
	   Most recently, Israel's Cabinet put off a vote to ratify the
accord after a suicide bombing Friday in Jerusalem that killed the
two assailants and injured 21 Israelis. The radical group Islamic
Jihad claimed responsibility.
	   Sunday, the Israeli army erected roadblocks, forbade residents
from leaving their homes for several hours and carried out searches
in the West Bank village of Kabatiya for a leader of the militant
group.
	   The Israeli army said troops had fired towards a fleeing
terrorist suspect there and soldiers found a pistol and fake
Israeli identification cards in the suspect's abandoned car.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said Sunday that Israel expects Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to formally outlaw the military wings of Islamic
Jihad and the larger militant group Hamas.
	   Hassan Asfour, a senior Palestinian official, said Hamas'
military wing, Izeddine al Qassam, and the military wing of Islamic
Jihad had been outlawed by the Palestinian Authority in 1996. But
Bar-Illan said the Palestinian legislature had never passed such a
law.
	   The accord states that the Palestinian Authority ``will inform
the United States fully of the actions it has taken to outlaw all
organizations (or wings of organizations, as appropriate) of a
military, terrorist or violent character, and their support
structure and to prevent them freedom of action in the areas under
its jurisdiction.''
	   A Palestinian security official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a joint meeting of Israeli and Palestinian security
officials was held Saturday night to discuss security in the wake
of Friday's attack.
	   The idea of outlawing Hamas and Islamic Jihad was brought up in
the meeting and also proposed by Netanyahu to Arafat during a phone
call, the official said.
	   The Palestinians said they could ban activity by Hamas or
Islamic Jihad that endangered either Israelis or Palestinians, but
could not outlaw them outright as political movements.
	   Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council
said Israel had no right to hinge implementation of the agreement
on the outlawing the terrorist groups.
	   Friday's bombing led to finger-pointing by both sides. Israel
said it showed Arafat's crackdown on terrorists had not been
sweeping enough.
	   The Palestinians, however, have also accused Israel of failing
to take at least partial security responsibility for the attack,
because both attackers came from Israeli-controlled areas, and had
recently served time in Israeli jails.
	   Israel as a rule is harshly critical of the Palestinian
Authority's security efforts when attackers come from
Palestinian-controlled areas or have been released from Palestinian
prisons.
	   On Sunday, Palestinian Justice Minister Freih Abu-Medein accused
Netanyahu of using the blast as a pretext for delaying
implementation of the peace accord.
	   ``This attack is a gift to Mr. Netanyahu,'' Abu-Medein said.
``All the time he is praying to God to help him ... to escape from
the agreement.''
	   Under the accord, Israel is to hand over another 13 percent of
the territory in the West Bank to the Palestinians in exchange for
various security steps.
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai predicted Sunday that
the Israeli Cabinet would ratify the agreement soon.
	   ``I estimate that the government will meet this week and will
accept the decision of the majority (in favor of the agreement),''
he said.

	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Clashes involving rival fans and police
officers at an Italian League game in this northern city Sunday
left at least a dozen people injured.
	   Two people were stabbed, though the wounds were not serious,
media reports said, during fighting before Bologna's 1-1 draw
against AS Roma.
	   After the game, a bus loaded with Roma supporters making the
trip home was hit with rocks and lit afire by local hooligans, the
ANSA news agency reported. One person was injured by broken window
glass.

Patriarch apologizes to mistreated saint
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AEGINA, Greece (AP) _ A Christian Orthodox saint praised for
honesty and charity received a posthumous apology Sunday for his
mistreatment at the hands of malicious rivals.
	   Patriarch Peter VII of Alexandria, who oversees the Orthodox
flock in Africa, said top clergymen felt it was time to formally
clear the reputation of Saint Nectarios 78 years after his death on
Aegina, an island about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southwest of
Athens.
	   Nectarios was elected to the senior church rank of metropolitan
bishop of a Greek community in Egypt in 1889 only to be expelled
the following year. It is believed that jealous clergymen falsely
accused him of plotting to oust the patriarch and take the position
for himself.
	   ``This was an obligation that we had to fulfill, to issue an
apology to the saint for his expulsion by our predecessors,'' the
patriarch told followers during a visit to Aegina, where Nectarios
is the patron saint. The island celebrates a holy day for Nectarios
on Monday.
	   The decision to apologize was taken by the governing body, or
Holy Synod, of the Orthodox Church of Alexandria on Egypt's
Mediterranean coast. Nectarios was elevated to sainthood in 1961,
but the Synod apparently considered a formal apology necessary.
	   Peter VII, installed as patriarch last year, is the spiritual
leader of the dwindling Greek Orthodox community of about 100,000
people in Africa, mainly in Alexandria and South Africa.

Arsenal beats Everton 1-0 to take second place
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Nicolas Anelka's fifth goal in five games gave
Arsenal a 1-0 victory Sunday over Everton, moving the defending
league and F.A. Cup champions into second place in the Premier
League behind Aston Villa.
	   Anekla scored in the sixth minute as the Gunners held on in
North London to push their point total to 23, two behind Villa.
	   In another key Sunday match, Manchester United played a 0-0 home
draw with Newcastle as the Reds slipped to third place with 22
points. Also on Sunday, Chelsea played a 1-1 draw at West Ham as
Neil Ruddock scored for West Ham in the fourth minute and Celestine
Babayaro equalized in the 76th.
	   In a late game, Sheffield Wednesday played at Leeds and in
Scotland, Rangers faced St. Johnstone with a chance to move four
points ahead in the Premier Division.
	   In a match in England first division between also-rans,
Stockport beat Port Vale 4-2.
	   On Saturday, Dion Dublin, in his first match with Aston Villa,
scored twice as league leaders beat Tottenham 3-2. Villa, unbeaten
in 11 league games this season, needed the victory after a home
loss Tuesday to Spain's Celta, eliminating the English side from
the UEFA Cup.
	   Dublin, who moved from Coventry earlier in the week on a
5.75-million-pound (dlrs 9.5 million) transfer from Coventry,
scored on a short volley in the 31st minute and then broke in all
alone to score in the 38th.
	   Fourth place Middlesbrough (18 points) had to settle for a 3-3
draw at last-place Southampton with all the goals comes in the
second period. Paul Gascoigne, trying to come back after entering a
substance-abuse clinic, got the first goal of the match in the 47th
as Middlesborough finished with only nine players.
	   Derby, playing without seven regulars, won 2-1 at Liverpool's
Anfield. It was Liverpool's first home loss of the season and a
come-down after eliminating Spain's Valencia Tuesday in the second
round of the UEFA Cup.
	   In other games Saturday: Blackburn 1, Coventry 2; Charlton 0,
Leicester 0; Nottingham Forest 0, Wimbledon 1.
	   In England's first division, Sunderland stayed on top with 37
points after a 3-1 home win over Grimsby. Ipswich has 32 points in
second place after a 2-2 draw at Huddersfield. Birmingham also has
32 after beating cross-town rival West Brom 3-1.
	   In Scotland's Premier Division, Celtic stunned Dundee 6-1 just
hours after club general manager Jock Brown resigned. Elsewhere in
Scotland's top league it was: Aberdeen 2, Dunfermline 1; Dundee
United 2, Motherwell 2. Hearts 2, Kilmarnock 1.

Sao Tome legislative election gets disorganized start

	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ Election officers
tardiness at polling stations and a scarcity of ballots delayed
voting for several hours in Sunday's general election in the west
African archipelago of Sao Tome, officials said.
	   Despite the disorganized start, the vote was running smoothly,
said Paulo Tembe, a political observer from Mozambique.
	   There were about 49,600 registered voters and final results were
expected Monday.
	   Eight parties were running in the country's third democratic
ballot, which will elect 55 lawmakers to the national assembly. The
party electing the most members will form a government.
	   The election was considered a race between the country's two
main political figures.
	   Former President Manuel Pinto da Costa's governing Sao Tome and
Principe Liberation Movement/Social Democratic Party and President
Miguel Trovoada's Independent Democratic Alliance based their
campaigns on centrist platforms, promising to boost the
impoverished country's economy.
	   After casting his ballot, Trovoada said this election showed
democracy was putting down deeper roots in the tiny country, whose
first democratic ballot was seven years ago.
	   Aside from late officials and a dearth of ballots, the election
was also delayed when some registered voters were not listed at
their polling stations, officials said.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In what he called the biggest win of his career,
Britain's Greg Rusedski played three inspired sets of
serve-and-volley tennis Sunday to beat world No. 1 Pete Sampras
6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 and win the dlrs 2.55 million Paris Open.
	   The 13th-seeded Rusedski slammed 18 aces during his surprise
victory, but also volleyed well, hit laser-sharp passing shots and
returned beautifully.
	   It was the first time he'd beaten Sampras in seven meetings.
	   ``Sometimes, everything works,'' Rusedski said later. ``It was a
magical match for me.
	   ``I've never beaten the world's No. 1 before. It's definitely
the biggest match of my career.''
	   Sampras, the defending champion here, didn't show any visible
effects of a back injury earlier in the week. But he was not at top
form _ especially in the third set. He double-faulted six times
during the match.
	   ``Greg was just too good today,'' Sampras said. ``My back was
fine. He just basically outplayed me.
	   ``I'm kind of kicking myself a bit.''
	   Yet both the first and second sets were tight ones. In the
first, the players held serve until the ninth game, when Sampras
double-faulted on break point, giving Rusedski a 5-4 lead. The
Briton closed out the set with two aces.
	   In the second set, Sampras blew four break points in the second
game. He eventually did break Rusedski for a 4-2 lead, exulting
with pumped fists, but at 5-3, serving for the set, he allowed
Rusedski to break back _ again on a double-fault. The set went to a
tightly fought tiebreaker, which Rusedski won 7-4 when Sampras hit
into the net.
	   In the third set, Sampras flagged, looking defeated. Rusedski
broke him for 2-0, and the American never recovered, despite
playing a great service game to hold at 3-5 and get the fans
cheering again.
	   Rusedski rolled to a 40-0 lead in the final game, then hit an
ace and jumped in the air, arms pumping.
	   ``He's pretty much kicked everyone's butt all week,'' a subdued
Sampras said. ``My hat's off to him.''
	   ``When he's hot, he's pretty tough.''
	   Rusedski, ranked 13th in the world, reached the U.S. Open finals
in 1997. The 25-year-old Briton confessed he was a latkk+I
	   ``Some people just mature later,'' he said.
	   He was playing in the Paris Open for the second time; last year
he reached the quarterfinals. He is also looking to qualify for the
ATP World Championships in Hanover, Germany for the second year.
Last year, he was the first British player to qualify.
	   Sampras is seeking to finish the year at No. 1 for the sixth
consecutive time. In Hanover, he will be competing for that honor
with the world's No. 2 player, Marcelo Rios of Chile.
	   Rusedski said he might even have a chance next year to reach No.
1. But Sampras wasn't so sure.
	   ``It's easier said than done,'' he said.

PLO radical leaders condemn Arafat, reject charter amendment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Accusing Yasser Arafat of betraying his
people, leaders of radical Palestinian groups announced Sunday that
they would block any effort to amend the Palestinian National
Charter.
	   The denunciation of Arafat came at a meeting called to discuss
Arafat's new accord with Israel and Israel's demand that the
Palestinian charter be amended to eliminate language calling for
the destruction of the Jewish state.
	   Ahmed Jibril, head of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, said said Arafat had ``relinquished the
Palestinian land and people and betrayed the Palestinian cause.''
	   George Habash, leader of the separate Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, said Arafat ``no longer represents the
Palestine Liberation Organization or the Palestinian National
Council,'' the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile.
	   Imad al-Alami, the representative in Damascus for the militant
Hamas group, stressed that armed struggle against Israel must
continue and that the charter calling for Israel's destruction
should remain in force.
	   Both Jibril's and Habash's groups are factions of Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization. Hamas and the Jihad group, which
also attended Sunday's meeting, are outside the PLO.
	   Israel wants Arafat to call for a meeting of the Palestinian
National Council to ask its members to annul the charter's
provisions.
	   It maintains Arafat promised to do so in the Wye accords signed
last month in Washington, but Arafat maintains that already was
done at a meeting of the council in the Gaza Strip in April 1996
and no further action is necessary.
	   It's unclear how Arafat will handle the issue later this month
at a ceremony in Gaza, which is supposed to be attended by U.S.
President Clinton, to which the 600 members of the national council
are to be invited.
	   Members of Arafat's Fatah organization, the PLO's mainstream
faction, dominate the council. But the Syria-based groups may be
able to head off any charter change by denying Arafat a quorum for
the meeting.
	   Syria also has opposed the Wye accord.

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Nationwide elections Sunday are for
governors and congressmen, but Venezuelans were also deciding the
political fortunes of a failed coup leader running for president on
an anti-corruption, anti-establishment platform.
	   Supported by millions of peasants and shantytown dwellers, a new
movement led by Hugo Chavez, who took up arms against the
government six years ago, appears poised for a strong showing in
Sunday's congressional vote.
	   With Venezuelan politics taking on overtones of class warfare,
officials fear an outbreak of violence. They dispatched about
100,000 soldiers and policemen to ensure peaceful voting, expelled
the local election board in the country's second most populous
state, and prohibited the sale of liquor and the carrying of
weapons.
	   President Rafael Caldera, whose army chief recently implied the
armed forces would seek to block Chavez's rise to power, cast his
ballot and declared the vote ``an expression of the will of the
people.''
	   In a country where fraud allegations often surround elections,
Caldera promised the results would be ``respected completely and in
a transparent, clean and honest way.''
	   About 11 million of Venezuela's 23 million inhabitants are
eligible to vote, and by midday Sunday, turnout looked strong.
	   In a front-page plea to its readers, the Caracas newspaper El
Universal tried to calm tensions.
	   ``We call for serenity, balance and strict respect for the
electoral results, as an expression of a sacred social pact,'' it
said.
	   Despite the surging popularity of Chavez's Patriotic Pole
coalition, Venezuela's two oldest parties _ the center-left
Democratic Action Party and the conservative Copei Party _ could
benefit from well-greased political machines bringing out the vote
Sunday for 23 governors, 48 senators, 189 members of congress and
391 state assembly members.
	   Yet polls show Chavez leading the Dec. 6 race for president, and
Patriotic Pole stands a good chance of winning the largest share of
Venezuela's bicameral congress, which is currently dominated by
Copei and Democratic Action.
	   ``I am optimistic because the people are alert, with their eyes
wide open,'' said Chavez as he voted Sunday amid shouts of ``Hugo!
Hugo!''
	   President Caldera's party, Convergence, which broke away from
Copei five years ago, is not expected to be a major player in these
elections.
	   Chavez's presidential opponent, Henrique Salas, does not have
much political machinery to bring out the vote Sunday for his
center-right Project Venezuela Party.

Stake sale to be worth more than 50 billion francs (dlrs 9

billion) &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France Telecom's 13 percent stake sale is expected
to bring in more than 50 billion francs (dlrs 9 billion), the the
company's chairman said Sunday.
	   ``With this operation France Telecom will finally have the
financial resources it needs for its development,'' Chairman Michel
Bon said at a news conference.
	   France launched the sale of the second tranche of France Telecom
on Saturday, a year after beginning the largest privatization
project in the nation's history.
	   Preplacement begins Monday for the sale, whose total estimated
value, Bon said, would be 50-60 billion francs (dlrs 9-10.9
billion).
	   The Finance Ministry said Saturday that 51 million France
Telecom shares would be sold, with an option of up to an additional
15 million shares -- equivalent to about 13 percent of the
company's capital.
	   The government also is to sell a 2 percent stake in France
Telecom to Germany's Deutsche Telecom. France Telecom will in turn
buy 2 percent of Deutsche Telekom for 10 billion francs (dlrs 1.8
billion).
	   France Telecom will issue a 5 percent capital increase.
	   Pricing on the shares is to be set on Nov. 28, with the maximum
price to be announced by the Finance Ministry on Nov. 23.
	   The public offer opens on Nov. 24 and will last three days.
	   Once the operation is completed, nearly 33 percent of France
Telecom will be traded on the market, compared with 22.5 percent
currently.
	   The government will hold 62 percent of the company, down from 75
percent currently, Deutsche Telekom will hold 2 percent and France
Telecom employees 3.1 percent of the company.
	   Bon offered little justification for spending 10 billion francs
for the Deutsche Telekom stake, saying only that it would help
cement the current partnership between the companies.
	   ``Just like in life, a partnership can work very well, but an
engagement helps to push it further,'' Bon said.
	   The French government in early October postponed the second
tranche sale, citing poor market conditions.
	   Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn was quoted in the weekly
Journal de Dimanche, a Sunday paper, as saying that he felt the
world stock market jitters had sufficiently passed to allow the
sale to go forward.

Britain's Agriculture Minister says he, too, is gay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Pursued by a tabloid newspaper and an ex-lover,
Britain's agriculture minister said Sunday that he is gay _ the
third member of the 22-strong Cabinet linked to gay rumors or
disclosures in the past two weeks.
	   Nicholas Brown said he regretted having ``to speak publicly
about this part of my life, and that people very dear to me will
find out about it in this way.''
	   The statement by Brown followed the first big sex scandal for
Prime Minister Tony Blair's government.
	   Welsh Secretary Ron Davies quit the Cabinet Oct. 27 over what he
called a ``lapse of judgment'' after being picked by a stranger and
robbed near Clapham Common, an area of south London known for
cruising homosexuals.
	   The Davies furor grew because he gave no clear explanation of
what had happened and, during much speculation about his sexuality,
a newspaper columnist said Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson is gay.
Mandelson did not respond to the comment.
	   Blair swiftly rallied to Brown, saying he would keep his job,
and other members of the governing Labor Party praised him as a
politician.
	   ``Nick Brown has given a full account of this relationship to
the prime minister and the prime minister is satisfied with that
account,'' Blair's Downing Street office said in a statement.
	   Brown, 48, made his announcement because an ex-lover offered the
story for sale to the News of the World, Britain's biggest selling
weekly tabloid.
	   Brown, who represents a solidly Labor north England district,
Newcastle upon Tyne East, said the relationship with the
unidentified man was ``based on friendship, not simply sex,'' and
had ended before Labor won the May 1997 national election.
	   ``I have always wanted to keep my private life and my sexuality
private,'' said Brown. ``That is my choice and I have always
believed it is a choice I and any other citizen should be entitled
to make ... The publication of this story will be upsetting not
just to me but to friends and family.''
	   Blair's Cabinet has the first openly gay minister in Britain,
Culture Secretary Chris Smith, whose appointment in May 1997 roused
little public comment.
	   The Davies affair started a new debate about media intrusion in
private lives, after Times of London columnist Matthew Parris, who
is gay, made the remark about Mandelson during a British
Broadcasting Corp. news program.
	   Mandelson prefers not to make an issue of his sexuality, but the
issue became a running joke on some satire programs because the BBC
ordered its staff members never to repeat Parris' remark.

Prince Charles pays tribute to British soldiers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ The Prince of Wales laid a wreath of
poppies and chrysanthemums in a suburban Skopje graveyard Sunday in
a tribute to British solders fallen in the Balkan battlefields of
World War One.
	   Prince Charles arrived in this southern Balkan nation of 2
million Sunday, the last stop of his four-nation, eight-day tour in
Eastern Europe.
	   The half-hour ceremony at the graveyard, where 120 British
soldiers are buried, was led by a British army chaplain and a
Macedonian Orthodox priest.
	   After laying the wreath for the fallen British soldiers, the
prince left the capital to tour 15th and 16th century Orthodox
churches in southern Macedonia. The prince, who didn't speak to the
public Sunday, is accompanied by an entourage of British investors
and diplomats.
	   Also Sunday afternoon, the prince was briefed at the Skopje
office of the British Broadcasting Corporation on relations between
native Macedonians and the country's ethnic Albanian minority, who
make up about 23 percent of the total population.
	   Macedonia has remained peaceful in the last eight months, while
armed ethnic Albanian guerrillas in neighboring Yugoslavia fight
for independence of Kosovo province.

Brazil to cut spending on infrastructure by 50 percent, says
</HEADLINE>
newspaper &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil will announce plans Monday
to slash in half spending on infrastructure projects as part of its
austerity program, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   A total of dlrs 2.5 billion (4 billion reals) will be cut from
next year's budget for building roads, rail lines and other
projects, said the O Folha de Sao Paulo daily.
	   The newspaper said the government had made a special effort to
protect spending on health and education. It did not say how much
cuts in these social areas would be.
	   Brazil announced Oct. 28 its plan to reduce 1999's budget by
dlrs 5.4 billion (8.7 billion reals) following a battering from the
global financial crisis.
	   Ministers and economists have been discussing where to make the
cuts. A government announcement is expected Monday.
	   Brazil's austerity plan, which aims to save a total of dlrs 24
billion next year, also includes a tax increase on bank transaction
charges and higher taxes for civil servants. The plan needs
approval from Congress.
	   The plan is believed to have helped Brazil secure an
international aid package, assembled by the International Monetary
Fund, worth between dlrs 30 and 40 billion. Confirmation of the
package is expected this week.

	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Peace talks over a border
dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia ended Sunday with no
breakthrough, but the two African nations returned home promising
to review the plan worked out by mediators.
	   ``We had lengthy talks with the two parties and we are waiting
to hear their views'' on the peace plan, said Burkina Faso
President Blaise Compaore, the current chairman of the Organization
of African Unity, which sponsored the two-day talks.
	   Officials said that while the two countries may eventually agree
to the plan, organizers had planned for a Sunday signing ceremony
if agreement had been reached.
	   Details on the peace plan, which was worked out by the mediators
and then presented to Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia and
Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki, were not immediately released.
	   The mediators _ Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore,
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Djibouti's President Hassan
Ghouled Aptidon _ met separately earlier Sunday with the two Horn
of Africa leaders.
	   Isaias declined to comment, but Zenawi hinted that the mediators
may be taking his country's side.
	   ``The OAU ... has been sticking to its charter that the
principles of aggression cannot be rewarded,'' Zenawi told
reporters. He declined further comment.
	   On Saturday, Zenawi warned neighboring Eritrea that their feud
will continue unless Eritrea withdraws from disputed territory.
	   OAU secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim also attended the
meetings, along with U.N. special envoy Mohamed Sahnoun.

	   SAO TOME, Sao Tome and Principe (AP) _ Election officers
tardiness at polling stations and a scarcity of ballots delayed
voting for several hours in Sunday's general election in the west
African archipelago of Sao Tome, officials said.
	   Despite the disorganized start, the vote was running smoothly,
said Paulo Tembe, a political observer from Mozambique.
	   There were about 49,600 registered voters and final results were
expected Monday.
	   Eight parties were running in the country's third democratic
ballot, which will elect 55 lawmakers to the national assembly. The
party electing the most members will form a government.
	   The election was considered a race between the country's two
main political figures.
	   Former President Manuel Pinto da Costa's governing Sao Tome and
Principe Liberation Movement/Social Democratic Party and President
Miguel Trovoada's Independent Democratic Alliance based their
campaigns on centrist platforms, promising to boost the
impoverished country's economy.
	   After casting his ballot, Trovoada said this election showed
democracy was putting down deeper roots in the tiny country, whose
first democratic ballot was seven years ago.
	   Aside from late officials and a dearth of ballots, the election
was also delayed when some registered voters were not listed at
their polling stations, officials said.

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A trial delayed 23 years by
Bangladesh's bitter and bloody politics culminated on Sunday with a
judge convicting and ordering death for 15 former military
commanders in the 1975 assassination of the country's first prime
minister.
	   Four others, including a former junior minister for information,
were acquitted in the killing of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, father of
current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, because there wasn't enough
evidence against them. After taking office in 1996, Hasina used her
power to bring her father's killers to trial, saying ensuring
justice would help entrench democracy in this volatile country.
	   The trial was a rare instance of a nation facing down a violent
episode in its past through the orderly exercise of the judicial
process. While there have been isolated instances of protest,
Bangladeshis generally welcomed the verdict.

Rusedski beats Sampras in straight sets

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In what he called the biggest win of his career,
Britain's Greg Rusedski played three inspired sets of
serve-and-volley tennis Sunday to beat world No. 1 Pete Sampras
6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 and win the dlrs 2.55 million Paris Open.
	   The 13th-seeded Rusedski slammed 18 aces during his surprise
victory, but also volleyed well, hit laser-sharp passing shots and
returned beautifully.
	   It was the first time he'd beaten Sampras in seven meetings.
	   ``Sometimes, everything works,'' Rusedski said later. ``It was a
magical match for me.
	   ``I've never beaten the world's No. 1 before. It's definitely
the biggest match of my career.''
	   Sampras, the defending champion here, didn't show any visible
effects of a back injury earlier in the week. But he was not at top
form _ especially in the third set. He double-faulted six times
during the match.
	   ``Greg was just too good today,'' Sampras said. ``My back was
fine. He just basically outplayed me.
	   ``I'm kind of kicking myself a bit.''
	   Yet both the first and second sets were tight ones. In the
first, the players held serve until the ninth game, when Sampras
double-faulted on break point, giving Rusedski a 5-4 lead. The
Briton closed out the set with two aces.
	   In the second set, Sampras blew four break points in the second
game. He eventually did break Rusedski for a 4-2 lead, exulting
with pumped fists, but at 5-3, serving for the set, he allowed
Rusedski to break back _ again on a double-fault. The set went to a
tightly fought tiebreaker, which Rusedski won 7-4 when Sampras hit
into the net.
	   In the third set, Sampras flagged, looking defeated. Rusedski
broke him for 2-0, and the American never recovered, despite
playing a great service game to hold at 3-5 and get the fans
cheering again.
	   Rusedski rolled to a 40-0 lead in the final game, then hit an
ace and jumped in the air, arms pumping.
	   ``He's pretty much kicked everyone's butt all week,'' a subdued
Sampras said. ``My hat's off to him.''
	   ``When he's hot, he's pretty tough.''
	   Rusedski, ranked 13th in the world, reached the U.S. Open finals
in 1997. The 25-year-old Briton confessed he was a late bloomer.
	   ``Some people just mature later,'' he said.
	   He was playing in the Paris Open for the second time; last year
he reached the quarterfinals. He is also looking to qualify for the
ATP World Championships in Hanover, Germany for the second year.
Last year, he was the first British player to qualify.
	   Sampras is seeking to finish the year at No. 1 for the sixth
consecutive time. In Hanover, he will be competing for that honor
with the world's No. 2 player, Marcelo Rios of Chile.
	   Rusedski said he might even have a chance next year to reach No.
1. But Sampras wasn't so sure.
	   ``It's easier said than done,'' he said.

PLO radical leaders condemn Arafat, reject charter amendment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Accusing Yasser Arafat of betraying his
people, leaders of radical Palestinian groups announced Sunday that
they would block any effort to amend the Palestinian National
Charter.
	   Arafat's new accord with Israel called for the Palestinians to
amend their charter to eliminate language calling for the
destruction of the Jewish state.
	   Ahmed Jibril, head of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, said at a meeting denouncing the
agreement that Arafat had ``relinquished the Palestinian land and
people and betrayed the Palestinian cause.''
	   George Habash, leader of the separate Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, said Arafat ``no longer represents the
Palestine Liberation Organization or the Palestinian National
Council,'' the Palestinians' parliament-in-exile.
	   Imad al-Alami, the representative in Damascus for the militant
Hamas group, said armed struggle against Israel must continue and
the charter should remain in force.
	   Both Jibril's and Habash's groups are factions of Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization. Hamas and the Jihad group, which
also attended Sunday's meeting, are outside the PLO.
	   Israel wants Arafat to call for a meeting of the Palestinian
National Council to ask its members to annul the charter's
provisions.
	   It maintains Arafat promised to do so in the Wye accords signed
last month in Washington, but Arafat maintains that already was
done at a meeting of the council in the Gaza Strip in April 1996
and no further action is necessary.
	   Members of Arafat's Fatah organization, the PLO's mainstream
faction, dominate the council. But the Syria-based groups may be
able to head off any charter change by denying Arafat a quorum for
the meeting.

Panathinaikos draws against Ethnikos, retains lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ League-leader Panathinaikos Athens were
held to a scoreless draw against last-placed Ethnikos Piraeus away
Sunday.
	   Despite the loss of two points, Panathinaikos retained the lead
in the Greek first division soccer league with 22 points from nine
games.
	   Crosstown AEK, which lost 2-1 to PAOK in Salonica Saturday,
follows with 20 points in second place.
	   Provincial club Xanthi of the northern town with the same name
is in third place with 19 points, also from nine games.
	   Olympiakos Piraeus has 16 points but with two games in hand. The
Piraeus club plays Monday against Ionikos Nikea.
	   In the day's major upset, Ethnikos fended off attacks by
Panathinaikos in a game played before 4,000 spectators in Piraeus.
	   With four key players sidelined because of injury, Panathinaikos
besieged Ethnikos' area from kickoff to the 90th minute. But its
players were out of focus.
	   On three occasions the visitors cane close to scoring, but their
shots went wide.
	   In the 83rd minute, Panathinaikos' Polish goalkeeper Jozef
Wandzik dived to steal the ball from Da Silva Sousa who was ready
to send the ball into the net. It was the best scoring opportunity
lost for Ethnikos.
	   In Salonica, Peruvian forward Percy Olivares struck twice in
second half to give PAOK a 2-1 victory over AEK.
	   The two teams measured each other at midfield for the first 20
minutes of the game.
	   In the 23rd, PAOK lost its only first half scoring opportunity
when Zissis Vryzas came face-to-face with goalie Ilias Atmatzidis,
but could not beat him. His weak shot was easily blocked.
	   In the 40th, Christos Maladenis passed to Demis Nicolaidis in
front of PAOK's goalmouth. AEK's top scorer spun round Italian
defender Mirco Taccola who had been his shadow since the start of
the game, to give his team a 1-0 lead. It was Nicolaidis' ninth
goal of the season.
	   PAOK became more aggressive after the rest period and drew level
when Olivares converted a penalty in the 63rd.
	   The penalty led to the expulsion of Dimitris Marcos who saw the
red card as the last player who downed Giorgos Toursounidis in
AEK's area.
	   With a one-man advantage, PAOK launched one attack after the
other as AEK fell back to preserve the tie.
	   Olivares scored the winner in the 74th to force AEK into its
first loss of the season.
	   The game ended without incident in contrast to last week's match
against Olympiakos Piraeus when angry PAOK supporters entered the
pitch and clashed with police when the referee canceled a goal by
the hosts in the 82nd minute.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Nicolas Anelka's fifth goal in five games gave
Arsenal a 1-0 victory Sunday over Everton, moving the defending
league and F.A. Cup champions into second place in the Premier
League behind Aston Villa.
	   Anekla scored in the sixth minute as the Gunners held on in
North London to push their point total to 23, two behind Villa.
	   In another key Sunday match, Manchester United played a 0-0 home
draw with Newcastle as the Reds slipped to third place with 22
points. Also on Sunday, Chelsea played a 1-1 draw at West Ham as
Neil Ruddock scored for West Ham in the fourth minute and Celestine
Babayaro equalized in the 76th.
	   At Leeds, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink scored in the 40th _ his first
goal in nine matches _ and Jonathon Woodgate got the clincher in
the 61st as Leeds beat Yorkshire rival Sheffield Wednesday 2-1.
Andy Booth scored for Wednesday in the third. Leeds improved to 17
points and Wednesday stayed on 11.
	   In a late game, Rangers faced St. Johnstone with a chance to
move four points ahead in the Premier Division.
	   In a match in England first division between also-rans,
Stockport beat Port Vale 4-2.
	   On Saturday, Dion Dublin, in his first match with Aston Villa,
scored twice as league leaders beat Tottenham 3-2. Villa, unbeaten
in 11 league games this season, needed the victory after a home
loss Tuesday to Spain's Celta, eliminating the English side from
the UEFA Cup.
	   Dublin, who moved from Coventry earlier in the week on a
5.75-million-pound (dlrs 9.5 million) transfer from Coventry,
scored on a short volley in the 31st minute and then broke in all
alone to score in the 38th.
	   Fourth place Middlesbrough (18 points) had to settle for a 3-3
draw at last-place Southampton with all the goals comes in the
second period. Paul Gascoigne, trying to come back after entering a
substance-abuse clinic, got the first goal of the match in the 47th
as Middlesborough finished with only nine players.
	   Derby, playing without seven regulars, won 2-1 at Liverpool's
Anfield. It was Liverpool's first home loss of the season and a
come-down after eliminating Spain's Valencia Tuesday in the second
round of the UEFA Cup.
	   In other games Saturday: Blackburn 1, Coventry 2; Charlton 0,
Leicester 0; Nottingham Forest 0, Wimbledon 1.
	   In England's first division, Sunderland stayed on top with 37
points after a 3-1 home win over Grimsby. Ipswich has 32 points in
second place after a 2-2 draw at Huddersfield. Birmingham also has
32 after beating cross-town rival West Brom 3-1.
	   In Scotland's Premier Division, Celtic stunned Dundee 6-1 just
hours after club general manager Jock Brown resigned. Elsewhere in
Scotland's top league it was: Aberdeen 2, Dunfermline 1; Dundee
United 2, Motherwell 2. Hearts 2, Kilmarnock 1.

Prosecuted Belgrade daily on trial again
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A new trial against a previously
banned Belgrade daily critical of President Slobodan Milosevic's
rule opened Sunday, roughly 24 hours after the paper resumed
publishing following weeks of government bans, court trials and
police raids.
	   In its first edition Saturday, Dnevni Telegraf ran an ad paid by
a Belgrade University student group that called for the abolishment
of the existing government, saying ``Resistance is the answer.
There is no other way, otherwise it will be too late ...This is not
a system, this is a disease, ... Pull yourselves together and
resist!''
	   Within hours, Bratislava Morina, Serbia's top official for
refugees and a close Milosevic associate, sued the daily for
running the ad, saying it violated Serbia's recently enacted media
law by ``jeopardizing the sovereignty and territorial integrity''
of the state.
	   Dnevni Telegraf was first banned last month under a government
decree demanding strictly ``patriotic'' coverage of events _
especially the ongoing crisis in Serbia's Kosovo province _ from
both independent and state-run media. Two other papers were also
banned.
	   The decree was then superseded by a restrictive media law that
levied hefty fines on media for articles authorities deemed
anti-state. Under the new law, Dnevni Telegraf's publishers and
editors were fined a total of dlrs 246,000 for articles in a sister
weekly magazine. When they refused to pay, police raided the
newspaper's Belgrade office, hauling away equipment in partial
compensation for the money owed.
	   The paper found a loophole to continue publishing by
reregistering from Serbia in Montenegro, the other Yugoslav
republic.
	   Sunday's trial, which took place behind closed doors, has also
hurt already tense relations between Yugoslavia's two republics.
Montenegro's pro-Western officials protested against Serbian
authorities ``harassment'' of independent publications now
registered in their republic.
	   The defendants and their lawyers stormed out of the Belgrade
district court after two hours of the hearings, protesting what
they saw ``partiality'' of the judge.
	   The judge was expected to pass a verdict later Sunday, although
it would not be made public until Monday.
	   A leading opposition party, the Democrats, criticized the trial
as unjust. ``It's a staged trial whose only purpose is to stifle
media freedom,'' they said in a statement. ``It reminds of the
worst Stalinist and fascist trials, where the verdict is know in
advance and the defendant has no chance to prove innocence.''
	   Milosevic virtually controls state-run media and has sought for
years to suppress the independent media. His efforts increased late
last month, under the threat of NATO airstrikes as punishment for
Serbia's crackdown in its province of Kosovo.

Twenty British armored personnel carriers delivered to Qatar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar, (AP) _ Qatar received on Sunday 20 British-made
armored personnel carriers, half the number purchased under a 1996
arms deal.
	   Qatar signed the deal with the London-based Alvis PLC for dlrs
22 million. A statement from Alvis said the first 20 Piranha APCs
were delivered Sunday and the remaining 20 would be delivered in
mid-1999.
	   The deal for the APCs was part of a dlrs 830 million package
negotiated with British arm-makers to also supply the oil-rich
emirate with warplanes and fast patrol boats.
	   The 1996 package was the first big contract for British
arms-makers in the Gulf for years. Britain had lost out to the
United States and France in weapons sales to the oil-rich region.
Qatar has defense cooperation agreements with Britain, the United
States and France.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Nationwide elections Sunday are for
governors and congressmen, but Venezuelans were also deciding the
political fortunes of a failed coup leader running for president on
an anti-corruption, anti-establishment platform.
	   Supported by millions of peasants and shantytown dwellers, a new
movement led by Hugo Chavez, who took up arms against the
government six years ago, appears poised for a strong showing in
Sunday's congressional vote.
	   With Venezuelan politics taking on overtones of class warfare,
officials fear an outbreak of violence. They dispatched about
100,000 soldiers and policemen to ensure peaceful voting, expelled
the local election board in the country's second most populous
state, and prohibited the sale of liquor and the carrying of
weapons.
	   President Rafael Caldera, whose army chief recently implied the
armed forces would seek to block Chavez's rise to power, cast his
ballot and declared the vote ``an expression of the will of the
people.''
	   In a country where fraud allegations often surround elections,
Caldera promised the results would be ``respected completely and in
a transparent, clean and honest way.''
	   About 11 million of Venezuela's 23 million inhabitants are
eligible to vote, and by midday Sunday, turnout looked strong.
	   However, the voting was plagued by long lines and confusion over
complicated ballots. Voting machines that were being used for the
first time in Venezuela were malfunctioning in many balloting
stations.

Panathinaikos draws against Ethnikos, retains lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ League-leader Panathinaikos Athens was
held to a scoreless draw against last-placed Ethnikos Piraeus away
Sunday.
	   Despite the loss of two points, Panathinaikos retained the lead
in the Greek first division soccer league with 22 points from nine
games.
	   Crosstown rival AEK, which lost 2-1 to PAOK in Salonica
Saturday, follows with 20 points in second place.
	   Provincial club Xanthi, of the northern town with the same name,
is in third place with 19 points, also from nine games.
	   Olympiakos Piraeus has 16 points but with two games in hand. The
Piraeus club plays Monday against Ionikos Nikea.
	   In Sunday's major upset, Ethnikos fended off attacks by
Panathinaikos in a game played before 4,000 spectators in Piraeus.
	   With four key players sidelined because of injury, Panathinaikos
besieged Ethnikos' area from kickoff to the 90th minute. But its
players were out of focus. On three occasions the visitors cane
close to scoring, but their shots went wide.
	   In the 83rd minute, Panathinaikos' Polish goalkeeper Jozef
Wandzik dived to steal the ball from Da Silva Sousa. It was
Ethnikos' best scoring opportunity.
	   In Salonica, Peruvian forward Percy Olivares struck twice in
second half to give PAOK a 2-1 victory over AEK.
	   In the 23rd minute, PAOK lost its only first half scoring
opportunity when Zissis Vryzas came face-to-face with goalie Ilias
Atmatzidis, but could not beat him. His weak shot was easily
blocked.
	   In the 40th, Christos Maladenis passed to Demis Nicolaidis in
front of PAOK's goalmouth. AEK's top scorer spun round Italian
defender Mirco Taccola who had been his shadow since the start of
the game, to give his team a 1-0 lead. It was Nicolaidis' ninth
goal of the season.
	   PAOK became more aggressive after the rest period and drew level
when Olivares converted a penalty in the 63rd.
	   The penalty led to the expulsion of Dimitris Marcos who was
given a red card for being the last player who downed Giorgos
Toursounidis in AEK's area.
	   With a one-man advantage, PAOK launched one attack after another
as AEK tried to preserve the tie.
	   Olivares scored the winner in the 74th to hand AEK its first
loss of the season.
	   The game ended without incident in contrast to last week's match
against Olympiakos Piraeus, when angry PAOK supporters entered the
pitch and clashed with police when the referee canceled a goal by
the hosts in the 82nd minute.

Rebels call killing of five a cease-fire violation

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An ethnic Albanian guerrilla on
Sunday called the killings of five uniformed rebels by police a
violation of Kosovo's de facto cease fire and police Serb police
searched for a second day for two missing officers.
	   Sebajdin Cena, who described himself as the Kosovo Liberation
Army doctor at its regional headquarters in Retinje village, said
one of the victims was commander of two brigades in the region.
	   The five died Friday on a road near Opterusa in central Kosovo.
Police described the encounter as a shootout and said the uniformed
KLA guerrillas fired first, and foreign observers reported a
similar account.
	   But Cena said police ambushed the two cars the rebels were
driving and that the KLA victims never fired a shot. He said two
others in the car were wounded and managed to crawl to safety, and
other KLA fighters exchanged gunfire with the police after the
initial ambush.
	   ``There is no logic saying the KLA got out of the car and shot
at an armored vehicle. The truth is that the police shot at them,''
Cena said. ``We consider it a violation of the cease-fire.''
	   According to Cena, the dead included Gjelal Hajda, 31, commander
of two KLA brigades in the region, and his assistant, Selajdin
Mullabazi, 29, along with three fighters.
	   He said the international community ``should put more pressure
on Serbs because the violence could spread.''
	   ``Whenever the police attack Albanian villages, we are not going
to wait to tell them to go back. We are going to use force,'' he
said.
	   On the same day the Albanians were killed, two Serbian police
officers Dejan Djatlov, 23, and Ilija Vujosevic, 48, disappeared
while distributing food to remote police checkpoints some 40
kilometers (25 miles) southwest of province's capital Pristina, the
Serb Media Center reported.
	   The two may have been abducted by the KLA, possibly in
retaliation for the killing of the five KLA guerrillas, Serb
sources said.
	   They are the latest of a few dozen Serb policemen to go missing
since the start of a Serb crackdown on Albanian separatists in
February. Since then, several hundred people _ including more than
100 police _ have been killed and up to 300,000 driven from their
homes.
	   Violence in predominately ethnic Albanian Kosovo flared anew
this past week, despite the de-facto peace treaty designed to end
bloodshed in the turbulent province and set the stage for a
political agreement between Serb authorities and Albanian leaders.
	   The Oct. 12 agreement between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke was reached under the
threat of NATO airstrikes on Yugoslav and Serb forces in the
region.
	   The Milosevic-Holbrooke agreement calls for setting up a 2,000
strong verification mission of unarmed observers run by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Until it
begins operating, unlikely before next month, a previous observer
mission started in July will continue to operate patrols throughout
Kosovo.

Rousseau holds talks; sponsorship deal could help resolve dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reported sponsorship deal; ADDS Bacher quote
about player flying out on Sunday &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A strike by West Indian cricket players that
threatens to wipe out the historic tour of South Africa could be
resolved by a reported sponsorship deal.
	   After four hours of talks Sunday between West Indian Cricket
Board President Pat Rousseau and the striking player, a WICB
official said players had begun talks with their lawyers _
presumably about agreeing to a proposed settlement.
	   Aiding any settlement might be a sponsorship deal reportedly
made by former South African wicketkeeper David Richardson, who
runs a sports marketing firm in Johannesburg.
	   Earning from the sponsorship proposal would apparently help meet
the players' demands for better pay, which is reported to range
from dlrs 15,000 to 60,000 for the South African tour.
	   WICB officials led by Rousseau and players Courtney Walsh, Brian
Lara and Carl Hooper, were the main actors in the talks at a hotel
near Heathrow airport aimed at securing the islanders first
official tour of South Africa.
	   Rousseau, who traveled overnight from the Caribbean, fired Lara
as captain and Hooper as vice-captain on Wednesday over demands for
better pay, setting off the boycott.
	   Asked as he entered the talks if Lara and Hooper would be
reinstated, Rousseau replied, ``I can't answer that right now.''
	   South African cricket head Ali Bacher said Sunday he was hopeful
a resolution was at hand.
	   ``I remain optimistic that we will get a solution today once the
two parties sit down and talk to each other,'' he said. ``I am
scheduled to leave on the 9.15 p.m. plane tonight. The first prize
would be get the players out tonight, the second prize would have
them traveling tomorrow.''
	   ``There are four flights out of Heathrow tonight and we have
made a provisional booking for the West Indies players,'' he added.
	   Bacher, West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd, and WICB member
Joel Garner arrived in London Friday and have held two days of
informal and unfruitful talks with the players.
	   The tour is scheduled to start with a one-day match at
Johannesburg on Tuesday. The first test is due to start on Nov. 26.
	   A key to settling the dispute is a letter sent to the players by
South African President Nelson Mandela. This would be the West
Indies' first official tour of South Africa since the end of
apartheid.
	   Reported solutions include more prize money, increased meal
money, and the reinstatement of Lara and Hopper to the squad. There
are also suggestions Walsh would be named captain.
	   In a letter dated Friday, the Barbados Cricket Association urged
the WICB and players to reach a compromise and said Lara and Hooper
should be reinstated.
	   Barbadian legislator Clyde Mascoll was more forceful and said
``the board should be fired.''
	   In Port-of-Spain, the Trinidadian capital, Lara's fans set up a
massive blackboard in the heart of the city at Woodford Square and
dozens signed it to show ``100 percent support for Lara and his
men.''
	   The crisis is being compared to the one in 1978 when West Indies
players snubbed the national team and contracted with Australian
magnate Kerry Packer's World Series of Cricket.

UEFA bans Fiorentina

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ European soccer officials on Sunday expelled
Italian league leader Fiorentina from this season's UEFA Cup for
the explosion last week that injured a match official and caused
the suspension of a UEFA Cup game against Grasshoppers.
	   The decision means that the Swiss team will advance to the third
round, facing Bordeaux.
	   UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Commission said the punishment
would have been more severe if there had not been mitigating
circumstances.
	   Fiorentina announced it would appeal.

<TEXT>
	   Fiorentina was leading 2-1 after the first 45 minutes of play.
Having won the first leg against the Swiss side 2-0, it expected
easily to advance to the third round of the UEFA Cup.
	   But the match in Salerno, near Naples, was suspended after a
Belgian off-field official was injured by the explosion of a device
hurled from the stands at the interval.
	   Philippe Flament, the ``fourth man,'' who stations at midfield
helping the referee and linesmen, was taken to hospital with a
right knee injury.
	   UEFA said that Fiorentina was responsible for security both
inside and outside the stadium, even though it was not its home
ground.
	   The game was being played in Salerno because Fiorentina was
paying the second and last round of suspension of its Franchi
stadium as a result fan violence during a 1997 Cup Winners Cup
game.
	   However, UEFA conceded that the explosive device was aimed at
the Fiorentina team and not at the Swiss club or match officials.
	   Otherwise, it said, it would have dealt a stiffer fine.
	   Fiorentina and Salerno fans have a history of rivalry. But the
club wanted to raise funds for victims of recent flooding in
southern Italy and so played at the grounds of its rival.
	   Italian papers reported that police questioned a local Salerno
man who was a suspect.

Juve lets 2-0 lead slip at Udine; Fiorentina retakes first
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Fiorentina out of UEFA Cup. will be updated with
Milan-Inter.
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Juventus of Turin failed to protect a two-goal lead
against Udinese on Sunday and lost its lead in the Italian League
standings.
	   The two-time defending champion allowed Udinese's Argentine
striker Roberto Sosa, a substitute, to score in the third-minute of
injury time and had to settle for a 2-2 draw. That result dropped
Juventus into second place behind Fiorentina, which routed
last-place Venezia 4-1 as Gabriel Batistuta, the Argentine star,
tallied twice to raise his league-leading total to 10 goals after
eight games.
	   Fiorentina had lost two of its last three games to fall from the
top spot, but Batistuta scored in the 40th and 64th minutes to lead
his club, which learned later Sunday it had been kicked out of the
UEFA Cup for last week's incident in which an explosive device was
tossed onto the field during a match against Swiss side
Grasshoppers.
	   Fiorentina improved to 6-0-2 for 18 points, one ahead of
Juventus (5-2-1). AS Roma sits third with 14 points after a 1-1
draw at Bologna, a match marred by pre-kickoff violent clashes
involving police and rival hooligans that left at least a dozen
people injured. Two people were stabbed, but the wounds were not
serious, RAI state TV said.
	   The match at Udinese started positively enough for Juventus, but
ended in disaster.
	   Zinedine Zidane, France's World Cup hero, hit the target for the
first time this season to give Juve the lead one minute before
halftime and Filippo Inzaghi made it 2-0 in the 49th. But
midfielder Jonathan Bachini headed in Belgian winger Johan Walem's
cross in the 65th and Sosa turned home Brazilian striker Marcio
Amoroso's assist in the dying seconds to complete the rally.
	   Adding injury to insult, Juventus captain Alessandro Del Piero
was taken off the field on a stretcher late in the game with a
hyperextended left knee. The striker, who turns 24 Monday, was
injured in a clash with Udinese defender Valerio Bertotto, and club
doctor Riccardo Agricola said it was not immediately clear who long
Del Piero will be out of action.

Communists ignite storm over anti-Semitic remarks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES thruout with Gaidar calling for ban,
Chubais saying it should be considered, background, details of
remarks. &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A political backlash gathered strength Sunday
against Russia's Communist Party, which incited old animosities
last week when it failed to condemn a member's virulent
anti-Semitism.
	   A powerful business tycoon and a former prime minister both
called for banning the party over its support of Albert Makashov, a
Communist member of parliament who recently blamed the country's
problems on ``zhidy,'' or ``yids.''
	   Former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar, raising the specter of Nazi
Germany, said the incident proved that the party had evolved into
fascism.
	   ``Fascist ideology is banned all over the world,'' he said on
Russian television. ``If Russia wants to remain a democratic state,
it should ban the Communist Party.''
	   The other prominent voice urging a ban was that of Boris
Berezovsky, one of the country's richest and most powerful men,
whose own Jewish origins have frequently served as a lightning rod
for Russian anti-Semites.
	   ``As was the case with the Soviet Union, which split into ethnic
entities, the Communists are now causing the Russian Federation to
split into ethnic entities,'' Berezovsky said, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   President Boris Yeltsin condemned the party Friday for its
stance, and several prominent Russian liberals said the government
should at least consider banning the Communists.
	   Yeltsin banned the Communists once before, for a year following
the failed 1991 coup attempt against Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.
	   It seems unlikely that any attempt to ban the party now would
succeed. Alexander Shokhin, a pro-government member of parliament,
noted Sunday on national television that the government would need
documented proof that anti-Semitism was the official policy of the
party.
	   While many people might argue that was true, it could be
difficult to prove.
	   Still, the remarks last month by Makashov were hardly
surprising: Anti-Semitism is deeply ingrained in Russia, and is
increasingly given expression by Communist and nationalist
politicians.
	   In an interview with the newspaper Zavtra, Makashov had said
that Jews ``drink the blood of the indigenous peoples of the state;
they are destroying industry and agriculture.''
	   The Communist-dominated Duma, the lower house of parliament,
refused to censure him last week, and many members openly offered
support.
	   Some Communist speakers at Saturday rallies celebrating the 81st
anniversary of Russia's revolution said Makashov was a hero who was
unfairly vilified by other politicians and the press for his
remarks.
	   ``By expressing their solidarity with Makashov at a rally in
Moscow on Nov. 7, the Communists placed themselves outside
civilized laws and outside Russian laws,'' said Berezovsky.
	   Berezovsky, who heads the Commonwealth of Independent States, a
loose coalition of former Soviet republics, also said that the
Communist Party was to blame for the collapse of the Soviet Union
and ``must be immediately banned.''
	   Among others weighing in was former Deputy Prime Minister
Anatoly Chubais, who said a ban should be seriously considered.
	   The Communists are the country's leading opposition group and
have the largest faction in parliament's lower house, the State
Duma.
	   The Communists have frequently criticized Russia's business
``oligarchs,'' including Berezovsky, saying they have taken control
of large chunks of the economy through corrupt, insider deals.
	   The businessmen in turn have been critical of the Communists,
saying they are determined to keep economic control in state hands.

More violence in Azerbaijan as mob attacks opposition leaders
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELCHIN TEIMURKHANOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ For the second day in a row, an
opposition rally in the Azerbaijani capital turned bloody Sunday
when several opposition leaders were attacked by a mob and beaten.
	   Among the victims was the former president of Azerbaijan,
Abulfaz Elchibey.
	   The attacks came one day after police broke up a rally in Baku
with riot sticks, injuring at least 18 people. Azerbaijan's
political opposition has been demonstrating for months against the
country's authoritarian president, Geidar Aliev.
	   Aliev won re-election last month in a contest that was boycotted
by most of his leading opponents, and denounced by international
observers. Demonstrators have been demanding that the results of
the balloting be struck down.
	   Azerbaijan is a strategically important nation on the oil-rich
Caspian Sea. It is at the center of an international debate that
will determine who benefits most from the tapping of the Caspian's
reserves.
	   About 15,000 people rallied Sunday. Unlike Saturday's
demonstration, this one had been sanctioned by the local
administration, and was allowed to take place without apparent
incident, despite the presence of about 1,000 police.
	   However, immediately after, the gang of about 30 unidentified
men attacked Elchibey, who is chairman of the main opposition
group, National Front, and two other leading opposition figures.
	   The other two, Democratic Party leader Ilyas Ismailov and
Liberal Party leader Lalu Shovket Gadzhiev, were especially badly
beaten. Rally participants managed to detain one of the attackers,
who was turned over to police.
	   Yashar Aliyev, deputy chief of the Baku police, said he was
aware of the incident and that it was under investigation.
	   Elchibey was Azerbaijan's first president after the breakup of
the Soviet Union. He was forced from office in June 1993 by Aliev,
who took over after a military mutiny.
	   Aliev had been the provincial KGB chief and, later, Communist
Party boss, when Azerbaijan was a Soviet republic.

French territory votes ``yes'' in referendum toward independence

<TEXT>
	   NOUMEA, New Caledonia (AP) _ New Caledonians turned out in force
Sunday to ratify a referendum on ``shared sovereignty'' that could
lead to independence in two decades for this French Pacific
territory.
	   The ``yes'' vote for a transition period giving broad new powers
to this territory 20,000 kilometers (12,430 miles) from Paris
totaled 71.8 percent of the ballots cast, the Ministry for Overseas
Territories in Paris announced.
	   The participation rate, higher than expected, totaled 74 percent
of the 107,000 people registered for the referendum, the ministry
said.
	   ``Today, there is a majority of people who want to work together
and decide our own future,'' said the leader of New Caledonia's
pro-independence movement Rock Wamytan.
	   The referendum was a grassroots confirmation of the Noumea
Accord reached May 5 and designed to put to rest decades of
division on the archipelago that led to riots and bloodshed in the
1980s.
	   New Caledonians were asked to decide whether to accept a
transition period of ``shared sovereignty'' for the archipelago, a
French territory for the past 150 years.
	   The Noumea Accord was signed by Paris, the Rally for Caledonia
in the Republic -- the RPCR -- and the Kanak and Socialist National
Liberation Front -- the FLNKS, which led the bloody struggle for
independence.
	   Both pro- and anti-independence parties had pressed for citizens
to vote ``yes,'' with each side interpreting the accord to his
liking.
	   The transition period will allow for New Caledonian to directly
run sectors like taxes, foreign trade, transport and
communications, while leaving to Paris key sectors like defense,
justice and police. A bill to lay the groundwork for the changes is
to go through parliament, likely in December.
	   The Territorial Congress will have the power to adopt specific
laws.
	   But the key feature of the accord is a new referendum to be
called in 15-20 years to decide on independence.
	   Conservative President Jacques Chirac expressed ``delight that
Caledonians have made the choice of consensus and responsibility in
preparing their future,'' the president's office said.
	   Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, one of those signing the
Noumea Accord, said the result confirms that ``New Caledonians want
to write together new pages in their common history.''
	   There were unfounded fears in Paris and Noumea that apathy would
prevail on referendum day.
	   Mounting social tension marked by strikes has preoccupied the
population, hit by the plummeting price of nickel -- the main
resource in New Caledonia, which has an estimated 30 percent of the
world's nickel reserve.
	   Angry dockers last week blocked Noumea's port to press demands
for improved indemnities in a plan to let go workers. Others
threatened a general strike.
	   And small-time miners, threatened by large mining groups and
diminishing incomes, blocked the main island road to press for
guarantees that would assure their survival.
	   New Caledonia is about 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) east of
Australia. Nearly half of the population are native Kanaks or
Melanesians, and about one-third are of European origin. The rest
are from other parts of Polynesia.

Rebels call killing of five a cease-fire violation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds:RECASTS and UPDATES with details, quotes from KLA figure;
changes byline, overline &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM COHEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ An ethnic Albanian guerrilla on
Sunday called the killings of five uniformed rebels by police a
violation of Kosovo's cease-fire and Serb police spent a second day
searching for two missing officers.
	   The five died Friday on a road near Opterusa in central Kosovo.
Police described the encounter as a shootout and said the uniformed
Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas fired first, and foreign
observers reported a similar account.
	   But Sebajdin Cena, who described himself as the KLA doctor at
its regional headquarters in Retinje village, said police ambushed
the two cars the rebels were driving and the KLA victims never
fired a shot.
	   Other KLA fighters exchanged gunfire with the police after the
ambush, he said.
	   ``There is no logic saying the KLA got out of the car and shot
at an armored vehicle. The truth is that the police shot at them,''
Cena said. ``We consider it a violation of the cease-fire.''
	   The dead included Gjelal Hajda, 31, commander of two KLA
brigades in the region, and his assistant, Selajdin Mullabazi, 29,
Cena said.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in the
Yugoslav federation. Ethnic Albanians make of 90 percent of
Kosovo's population.
	   Serb's began cracking down on ethnic Albanian separatists began
in February. Since then, several hundred people have been killed
and up to 300,000 driven from their homes.
	   Cena said the international community ``should put more pressure
on Serbs because the violence could spread.''
	   ``Whenever the police attack Albanian villages, we are not going
to wait to tell them to go back. We are going to use force,'' he
said.
	   On the same day the Albanians were killed, two Serbian police
officers, Dejan Djatlov, 23, and Ilija Vujosevic, 48, disappeared
while distributing food to remote police checkpoints some 40
kilometers (25 miles) southwest of province's capital Pristina, the
Serb Media Center reported.
	   The two may have been abducted by the KLA, possibly in
retaliation for the killing of the guerrillas, Serb sources said.
	   They are the latest of a few dozen Serb police officers to go
missing since the crackdown started.
	   Violence in predominately ethnic Albanian Kosovo flared anew
this past week, despite the peace accord designed to end bloodshed
in the turbulent province and set the stage for a political
agreement between Serb authorities and ethnic Albanian leaders.

UEFA bans Fiorentina
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ European soccer officials on Sunday expelled
Italian league leader Fiorentina from this season's UEFA Cup after
an explosion during last week's game against Switzerland's
Grasshoppers injured a match official and caused the suspension of
a UEFA Cup game.
	   The decision means that the Swiss team will advance to the third
round, facing Bordeaux.
	   UEFA's Control and Disciplinary Commission said the punishment
would have been more severe if there had not been mitigating
circumstances.
	   Fiorentina announced it would appeal.
	   Fiorentina was leading 2-1 after the first 45 minutes of play.
Having won the first leg against the Swiss side 2-0, it expected
easily to advance to the third round of the UEFA Cup.
	   But the match in Salerno, near Naples, was suspended after a
Belgian off-field official was injured by the explosion of a device
hurled from the stands at the interval.
	   Philippe Flament, the ``fourth man,'' helps the referee and
linesmen, was taken to hospital with a right knee injury.
	   UEFA said that Fiorentina was responsible for security both
inside and outside the stadium, even though it was not playing on
its home ground.
	   The game was being played in Salerno because Fiorentina was
paying the second and last round of suspension of its Franchi
stadium as a result fan violence during a 1997 Cup Winners Cup
game.
	   However, UEFA conceded that the explosive device was aimed at
the Fiorentina team and not at the Swiss club or match officials.
	   Otherwise, it said, it would have decided on a more severe
penalty.
	   Fiorentina and Salerno fans have a history of rivalry. But the
club wanted to raise funds for victims of recent flooding in
southern Italy and so played its rival's grounds.
	   Italian papers reported that police questioned a local Salerno
man who was a suspect.

Leader of first Everest conquest dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ John Hunt, leader of the British expedition which
first climbed Mount Everest, has died at age 88.
	   Hunt died at his home in Henley-on-Thames Saturday night, said
his daughter, Sally Nesbitt. The family's announcement on Sunday
said only that Hunt died following a brief illness.
	   As leader of the expedition in 1953, Hunt decided it was his
responsibility to remain at base camp while Edmund Hillary and
Tenzing Norgay climbed the last 400 feet (120 m) to the summit.
	   Hunt recalled that he wept for joy when the two men reached the
top on May 29, calling it the greatest moment of his life, but it
was tinged with personal disappointment.
	   ``It was my ambition just as much as everybody else's in the
party to be first at the top,'' he said in an interview with the
Evening News in 1978.
	   ``I thought about it a lot and concluded that it was important
for the leader to be in a position where he could exercise some
control if necessary. It did not seem that I could do both.''
	   In fact, Hunt and two other members of the team made the first
attempt on the south col, but stopped 400 feet (120 m) short of the
sumit. They left their equipment and supplies for Hillary and
Tenzing to make the second attempt.
	   Had they failed, Hunt said he was prepared to lead a third
assault on the peak.
	   Hunt was a colonel in the British Army when he was tapped to
lead the Everest expedition. He later felt that his
mountain-climing fame thwarted his ambitions of reaching the
highest ranks of the army, and he retired in 1956 to become the
first director of the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme promoted by
Prince Philip.
	   He was knighted in 1953 and elevated in 1966 to the House of
Lords, where he took the titlle of Baron Hunt of Llanfairwaterdine.
He was a personal adviser to Prime Minister Harold Wilson during
the Nigerian civil war in the late 1960s and directed British
relief missions to that country.
	   Hunt is survived by his wife Joy, whom he married in 1936, and
their four daughters. Funeral arrangements were not announced.

AIK Stockholm wins Swedish League championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Alexander Ostlund scored his only goal
of the season Sunday as AIK Stockholm edged Orgryte 1-0 Sunday to
clinch the Swedish League title.
	   ``Now I hope all our fans will forgive me for missing so many
scoring opportunities this season,'' said Ostlund, a 20-year-old
striker.
	   His game-winner came five minutes into the second half before a
crowd of 18,017 at Rasunda Stadium.
	   AIK won its 10th championship and second in six years despite
scoring the fewest goals _ 25 _ in the 14-team league, one goal
less than last-placed Oster.
	   Key players on the team included Anders Limpar, who was a member
of Sweden's squad that finished third in the 1994 World Cup in the
United States, and fellow midfielder Johan Mjallby, who helped
Sweden beat England in a European qualifier in the same stadium
earlier this fall.
	   Mjallby is expected to join a foreign team soon.
	   ``(Glasgow) Celtic leads the race,'' Mjallby said.
	   Helsingborgs IF, which lost 2-1 at Hacken, finished two points
behind AIK. Third place went to another Stockholm side, Hammarby, a
further two points behind.
	   Former two-time UEFA Cup champion IFK Goteborg, tipped as a
major contender for the championship, had a nightmare season and
finished eighth.
	   Arild Stavrum, Helsingborg's Norwegian striker, won the scoring
title with 18 goals in 24 games.

Tendulkar leads India to seven-wicket win over Zimbabwe

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with India innings. CHANGES overline to
India win &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Sachin Tendulkar hammered
his 20th one-day century to lead India to a seven-wicket win Sunday
over Zimbabwe in the third match of the Coca Cola Trophy.
	   Tendulkar, reveling on the plumb pitch, carved out a brilliant
118 not out from 112 balls as India reached Zimbabwe's modest score
of 196 in 40.4 overs.
	   Sunday's win, which was India's second, also gave India a place
in the final of the three-nation tournament. India recorded its
first win by beating Sri Lanka by seven wickets on Saturday.
	   Tendulkar, playing in his usual top form, smacked 14 boundaries
and two sixes, including one that scaled the stadium roof. He
reached his century in 97 balls.
	   Left handed opener, Sauruv Ganguly and Captain Mohammed
Azharuddin gave good support to India's innings, but Tendulkar, who
holds the record for the most one-day centuries, stole the show.
	   ``Personal records don't interest me and I always play for my
country,'' said a modest Tendulkar.
	   Paul Strang was Zimbabwe's best bowler picking up 3 for 32 from
10 overs.
	   Zimbabwe, who beat world champions Sri Lanka on Friday by seven
wickets, were beaten by India for a similar score.
	   When fielding, spinner Anil Kumble and newcomer, Nikhil Chopra,
snapped up two wickets each in their 10 overs spells as Zimbabwe
became all out for 196.
	   Kumble had 2 for 31, while Chopra had a neat 2 for 21 in their
10 over spell.
	   Zimbabwe gave India some rough treatment in the opening of the
match with Captain Alastair Campbell (25 off 32 balls) displaying
good control on the Indian pacemen, Javagal Srinath and Ajit
Agarkar.
	   But a superb direct throw by Agarkar dismissed Campbell with the
score at 44 in the 11th over. Campbell's dismissal triggered a fall
of wickets, which saw Zimbabwe lose its next five wickets for the
addition of only 39 runs.
	   Zimbabwe was jinxed with Grant Flower given leg before wicket to
Kumble by Pakistani Umpire Javed Akhtar, for 17 in the 24th over.
	   All-rounder Heath Streak came to Zimbabwe's rescue with a
seventh wicket partnership worth 68 runs with Craig Wishart, who
made a gritty 25 of 41 balls.
	   Streak made 59 runs off 71 balls, which was his best one-day
score so far. His knock also helped Zimbabwe cross a 150-run mark,
recovering from a poor 86 for 6.
	   Streak, who clubbed two sixes of left arm spinner Sunil Joshi's
9th over was dismissed by a brilliant catch taken by Sauruv Ganguly
in the 47th over bowled by Srinath.
	   India needed an average 4 runs an over to win in the 50 over the
match.

UEFA bans Fiorentina for one season

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Italian league leader Fiorentina was kicked out of
this season's European club competition Sunday in punishment for
the explosion that injured a match official and caused the
suspension of a UEFA Cup game last week.
	   Fiorentina immediately announced it would appeal. If that fails,
it will be Grasshoppers of Zurich that advances to the third round
of the UEFA Cup against France's Bordeaux.
	   ``Fiorentina was responsible for order and security both inside
and around the stadium, before during and after the match and
therefore liable for incidents of any kind,'' said UEFA's Control
and Disciplinary Commission.
	   ``Had there not been mitigating circumstances, Fiorentina AC
would have been excluded from future UEFA club competitions as
well,'' it said.
	   Specifically it cited the fact that it was apparently a
supporter of Fiorentina's Italian rival, Salerna, who threw the
device. The match was held at Salerna, near Naples in southern
Italy.
	   Fiorentina was leading 2-1 after the first 45 minutes of play.
Having won the first leg against the Swiss side 2-0, it expected
easily to advance to the third round of the UEFA Cup.
	   But the match was suspended after a Belgian off-field official
was injured by the device hurled from the stands at the interval.
	   Philippe Flament, the ``fourth man,'' who stations at midfield
helping the referee and linesmen, was taken to hospital with a
right knee injury.
	   The game was being played in Salerno because Fiorentina was
paying the second and last round of suspension of its Franchi
stadium as a result fan violence during a 1997 Cup Winners Cup
game.
	   UEFA said Fiorentina's previous bad record had been taken into
account on deciding on the expulsion.
	   Fiorentina and Salerno fans have a history of bitterness. But
Fiorentina club wanted to raise funds for victims of recent
flooding in southern Italy and so played at the grounds of its
rival.
	   Italian papers reported that police questioned a local Salerno
man who was a suspect.
	   Luciano Luna, the administrator of Fiorentina, said his club
would appeal by the Wednesday midnight deadline.
	   ``The bomb was aimed at Fiorentina, not against the referees and
not against the Grasshoppers players,'' he said.
	   Luna was called into the disciplinary commission's meeting at a
Geneva airport hotel to be told of the decision.
	   The UEFA Cup is the least lucrative of the three European club
tournaments. But even so, it is still an important money-spinner
for the clubs.
	   At least Fiorentina is still on course for a place in next
season's European Cup. It moved to the top of the Italian league
Sunday with a 4-1 win over last-place Venezia.
	   Fiorentina had lost two of its last three games to fall from the
top spot.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ As U.S. officials studied a possible
military strike against Iraq, Iraqi ministers said Sunday they were
not afraid of American attacks and would not back down on barring
U.N. arms inspections.
	   Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told reporters that Iraq is
not cowed by U.S. threats. ``We are not fearing from any military
strike ... and our country is prepared to face any military
aggression,'' he said.
	   ``They will not kill in a military strike more than they are
killing with sanctions every day,'' Saleh said, referring to U.N.
Security Council trade sanctions imposed on Iraq since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz also told the official Iraqi
News Agency that the government was not moved by a U.N. Security
Council resolution last week holding it in ``flagrant violation''
of U.N. edicts.
	   ``Iraq adheres to its stance until the Security Council fulfills
its obligation toward Iraq,'' INA quoted Aziz as saying. This, he
said, involved lifting the U.N. ban on oil sales ``as a start
toward the final lifting of the whole embargo.''
	   Aziz _ the most senior Iraqi official to react to the latest
U.N. resolution _ spoke after meeting a delegation of Irish and
Scottish politicians who said they opposed the use of force against
Iraq.
	   ``I think nothing is solved by military action,'' said Tam
Dalyell, a Scottish member of the British Parliament who
accompanied Reynolds. ``It just creates a bitterness between old
friends that I deplore.''
	   Dalyell said the delegation's leader, former Irish Prime
Minister Albert Reynolds, planned to brief U.S. President Bill
Clinton about his findings in Baghdad, adding: ``I hope it does
some good.''
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah,
also met Sunday with Aziz. Shah refused to give details of the
session to reporters.

Congolese rebels challenge Kabila to negotiate peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Congolese rebels on Sunday challenged
President Laurent Kabila to negotiate an end to their three-month
war, or face a military defeat.
	   Bizima Karaha, a rebel leader, said Rwanda's acknowledgment
Friday that it is supporting the rebels had removed the last
obstacle to direct negotiations with the government on how to end
fighting and resolve political disputes.
	   African and U.S. negotiators are hoping Rwanda's statement will
lead the eight foreign powers involved in the war to agree to a
cease-fire and a withdrawal of forces from Congo.
	   So far, both the government in the Congolese capital of Kinshasa
and its main ally, Zimbabwe, have reacted coolly to the prospect of
talks with the rebels, who have been fighting since Aug. 2.
	   Congo is demanding an unconditional withdrawal of Rwandan and
Ugandan troops before any deal can be reached.
	   ``We are challenging Kabila to negotiate, now that Rwanda has
made its presence in Congo clear and removed that last obstacle to
peace talks,'' Karaha told The Associated Press from the eastern
rebel stronghold of Goma. ``Kabila will have to negotiate sooner or
later. If he keeps refusing, then we shall make it public to the
Congolese people that he is the obstacle and has to go.''
	   The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis, opposition
politicians and disenchanted Congolese soldiers _ accuse Kabila of
mismanagement, corruption and warmongering among Congo's 400
tribes.
	   Karaha said Rwanda's involvement was legitimate because of
concerns that former Hutu soldiers and militiamen who fled Rwanda
in fear of reprisals for a 1994 genocide were using eastern Congo
to launch attacks against that country.
	   Meanwhile, rebel forces on Saturday captured Aketi, 800
kilometers (500 miles) northwest of Goma, Karaha said.
	   Since they were defeated outside Kinshasa in August by Kabila's
allies from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, the rebels have made
steady gains from their eastern strongholds in northern Congo and
the southern, mineral-rich provinces of Katanga and Eastern Kasai.
	   Karaha said his troops had killed more than 100 Chadian soldiers
and took prisoner 200 others in fighting for Aketi. Chad has sent
2,000 troops to prop up Kabila.

Namibia calls for Caprivi rebels to be returned from Botswana
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Namibian President Sam Nujoma demanded
that Botswana return a group of 130 alleged rebels to Namibia,
where they would stand trial for high treason and murder.
	   In a state of the nation address broadcast Saturday on national
television and radio, Nujoma said the group was headed by a former
opposition leader, Mishake Muyongo, and advocated secession for a
panhandle area in northeast Namibia called the Caprivi strip.
	   ``They have committed a serious act of treason and coldblooded
murder in the Republic of Namibia,'' said Nujoma. ``We will make
them pay for this.''
	   The group fled to Botswana about ten days ago, where members are
being held on charges of illegally crossing the border and carrying
arms of war. They have applied for political asylum.
	   Nujoma accused the group of launching an armed rebell} &UR; ''
9jUII%95RtK+$K$]4eir supporters who wanted to back out of the
secessionist pact.
	   Botswana is holding group in Kasane, a northern border town,
where they are expected to appear in court later this week. The
Botswana office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) is considering their application for refugee
status.
	   According to Namibian media reports last week, the group
includes Caprivi's regional governor, John Mabuku, teachers and
school children. They were carrying rocket propelled grenades,
mortar bombs and mortar launchers, the reports said.
	   The 400-kilometer (240-mile) long Caprivi strip, home to about
110,000 people, borders with Angola, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Prior to Namibian independence in 1990, it was administered by a
string of outside rulers that included Zambia, Botswana and South
Africa.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ As U.S. officials studied a possible
military strike against Iraq, Iraqi ministers said Sunday they were
not afraid of American attacks and would not back down on barring
U.N. arms inspections.
	   Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh said Iraq has suffered for
so long under U.N. sanctions that have crippled the country that it
has nothing to fear from new U.S. threats.
	   ``They will not kill in a military strike more than they are
killing with sanctions every day,'' Saleh said, referring to U.N.
Security Council trade sanctions imposed on Iraq since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``Our country is prepared to face any military aggression,'' he
said.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz also told the official Iraqi
News Agency that the government was not moved by a U.N. Security
Council resolution last week holding it in ``flagrant violation''
of U.N. edicts.
	   ``Iraq adheres to its stance until the Security Council fulfills
its obligation toward Iraq,'' INA quoted Aziz as saying. This, he
said, involved lifting the U.N. ban on oil sales ``as a start
toward the final lifting of the whole embargo.''
	   Iraq last month announced it was halting cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors until the Security Council begins moving to lift
the embargo, which has devastated Iraq's economy.
	   The Security Council has said the embargo won't be lifted until
U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction, as required by U.N. resolutions that ended the
1991 Gulf War over the Kuwait occupation.
	   Iraq says the sanctions, which prevent almost all trade with
Iraq, have led to the deaths of 1.5 million Iraqis in the past
eight years _ many of them children _ by causing shortages of food
and medicine and a deterioration of water and sewage systems.
	   ``We are losing 4,500 children per month _ that means nearly
60,000 per year,'' Saleh said. ``I don't think a military strike
would kill 60,000 children as sanctions are killing now.''
	   Aziz, the most senior Iraqi official to react to the latest U.N.
resolution, spoke after meeting a delegation of Irish and Scottish
politicians who said they opposed the use of force against Iraq.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A solitary goal from Brazilian Roberto
Carlos in the 50th minute Sunday saved Real Madrid from an
embarrassing defeat by lowly Alaves, but the 1-1 final scoreline
lost the white-clad team the leadership of the Spanish first
division.
	   Meanwhile, a penalty shot put away by Dani Lara in the 32nd was
enough to give Mallorca victory over last-to-bottom Villarreal and
leapfrog over Real Madrid in the table.
	   Mallorca's victory left the side with 19 points, two ahead of
Real Madrid and three of FC Barcelona which plays its 9th-round
game later Sunday against Oviedo.
	   The income from Mallorca's game at the Luis Sitjar stadium were
to be donated to the Central American countries devastated by
Hurricane Mitch.
	   Madrid's third draw of the season was far from a lovely present
for Dutch coach Guss Hiddink on his 52nd birthday disappointment,
but it could have been worse.
	   Manolo Canabal, a former Madrid player, put Alaves ahead in the
34th leaving Real Madrid trailing until Roberto Carlos scored the
equalizer in the 50th thanks to a pass by Dutch midfielder Clarence
Seedorf.
	   In other ninth-round games Sunday it was: Atletico de Madrid 1,
Deportivo de La Coruna 1; Real Sociedad 3, Athletic de Bilbao 1;
Valencia 3, Racing de Santander 0; Salamanca 1, Zaragoza 2; Celta
5, Extremadura 1; Tenerife 2, Valladolid 2.
 &UR; Celta 5, Extremadura 1 &QC; 
	   After a goal-dry first half Celta's goals came raining down with
from Russian striker Alexander Mostovoi ensuring an ample victory
over last-place Extremadura.
	   Mostovoi scored Celta's first in the 48th, followed nine minutes
later by a header of Juan Sanchez taking the score to 2-0.
	   Mostovoi scored again in the 66th. Tomas Alberto Hervas notched
Celta's fourth goal at minute 81, and Russian midfielder Valery
Karpin scored the team's fifth at minute 83rd.
	   Manuel Mosquera scored a consolation goal for Extremadura in
minute 68th.
 &UR; Real Sociedad 3, Athletic de Bilbao 1 &QC; 
	   In the northern city of San Sebastian, Oscar de Paula put
struggling Real Sociedad ahead in the Basque region derby with a
goal in the third minute. Ricardo Sa Pinto added the second for the
home team in the 12th with a shot from the right side.
	   Defense Aitor Larrazabal clinched the Athletic's only goal in
the 82nd minute but Real sealed it 3-1 victory with a goal by
Yugolav striker Darko Kovasevic just seconds before the whistle.
	   With this win Real Sociedad jumped to the mid position of the
table with 12 points from three draws, three wins and three defeats
while Athletic de Bilbao stayed with 10 points.
 &UR; Valencia 3, Racing de Santander 0 &QC; 
	   In Valencia, Yugoslav striker Miroslav Djukic scored the home
team's first goal just before the break.
	   Swedish Stefan Schwarz scored the second in the 47th and Claudio
Lopez of Argentina scored another in the 62nd to lead Valencia
(5-0-4) and keep Extremadura in the last place.
 &UR; Atletico de Madrid 1, Deportivo de La Coruna 1
	   Atletico took the lead with a goal by Spanish forward Jose Mari
Romero in the 70th minute but Deportivo replied with an equalizer
from Brazilian Djalminha eleven minutes later.
	   The results left Atletico with 14 points and Deportivo with 13.
	   In Saturday's only 9th-round game Espanyol defeated Betis 1-0.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Italian league leader Fiorentina was kicked out of
this season's European club competition Sunday in punishment for
the explosion that injured a match official and caused the
suspension of a UEFA Cup game last week.
	   Fiorentina immediately announced it would appeal. If that fails,
it will be Grasshoppers of Zurich that advances to the third round
of the UEFA Cup against France's Bordeaux.
	   ``Fiorentina was responsible for order and security both inside
and around the stadium, before during and after the match and
therefore liable for incidents of any kind,'' said UEFA's Control
and Disciplinary Commission.
	   ``Had there not been mitigating circumstances, Fiorentina AC
would have been excluded from future UEFA club competitions as
well,'' it said.
	   Specifically it cited the fact that it was apparently a
supporter of Fiorentina's Italian rival, Salerna, who threw the
device. The match was held at Salerna, near Naples in southern
Italy.
	   Fiorentina was leading 2-1 after the first 45 minutes of play.
Having won the first leg against the Swiss side 2-0, it expected
easily to advance to the third round of the UEFA Cup.
	   But the match was suspended after a Belgian off-field official
was injured by the device hurled from the stands at the interval.
	   Philippe Flament, the ``fourth man,'' who stations at midfield
helping the referee and linesmen, was taken to hospital with a
right knee injury. Several players were temporarily deafened.
	   The game was being played in Salerno because Fiorentina was
paying the second and last round of suspension of its Franchi
stadium as a result fan violence during a 1997 Cup Winners Cup
game.
	   UEFA said Fiorentina's previous bad record had been taken into
account on deciding on the expulsion.
	   Fiorentina and Salerno fans have a history of bitterness. But
Fiorentina club wanted to raise funds for victims of recent
flooding in southern Italy and so played at the grounds of its
rival.
	   Italian papers reported that police questioned a local Salerno
man who was a suspect.
	   Luciano Luna, the administrator of Fiorentina, said his club
would appeal by the Wednesday midnight deadline. The appeal is
likely to be heard next weekend.
	   ``The bomb was aimed at Fiorentina, not against the referees and
not against the Grasshoppers players,'' he said.
	   Luna was called into the disciplinary commission's meeting at a
Geneva airport hotel to be told of the decision after the three
hour session.
	   ``We welcome the decision of UEFA and think it's a sensible
decision given the circumstances,'' said Grasshoppers' president
Romano Spadaro.
	   ``We are looking forward to playing against Bordeaux,'' he said.
The third round takes place Nov. 24 and Dec. 8.
	   The UEFA Cup is the least lucrative of the three European club
tournaments. But even so, it is still an important money-spinner
for the clubs.
	   At least Fiorentina is still on course for a place in next
season's European Cup. It recovered its place at the top of the
Italian league Sunday with a 4-1 win over last-place Venezia.
	   Fiorentina had lost two of its last three games to fall from the
top spot.

Cyprus says Israeli spy suspects weren't working for Israel

weren't working for Israel; comments from Cypriot ambassador,

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The two Israelis arrested in Cyprus on
suspicion of spying were not working for Israel, the Cypriot
government said Sunday.
	   ``From the investigations to date, nothing has transpired to
link this issue with the government of Israel,'' the Cypriot
Justice Ministry said Sunday.
	   There were no other details. A Cypriot police source, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said the Israelis were suspected of
spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern
third of Cyprus in 1974.
	   Cypriot police said the two men would be brought before a remand
hearing Nov. 16.
	   The two Israelis were arrested Saturday in a small community of
Ziyi near the southern coastal resort of Larnaca. Cypriot police
said they found cameras, wireless instruments, tapes of
conversations between police, radio scanners and maps in the
apartment the two were renting.
	   The two Israelis were visited Saturday and Sunday by Israeli
consulate officials.
	   Turkey has significantly increased military cooperation with
Israel in the past two years. Israeli military analyst Ron Ben
Yishai, writing in the Yediot Ahronoth newspaper, suggested the
arrests were meant as a warning to Israel not to cooperate with
Turkey in any spy operation.
	   Some Israeli press reports speculated about whether the pair's
presence had anything to do with Cyprus' recent purchase of S-300
anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.
	   Cyprus fears Israel is training Turkish pilots on how to bomb
the missile batteries once they are installed. Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides reaffirmed Saturday that his government would go
ahead and deploy the anti-aircraft missiles.
	   Rafi Eitan, a former Mossad operator, speculated that the two
suspects might have been hired by a private Turkish outfit.
	   Israel TV said the two men arrived three weeks ago during a
military training exercise in the area.
	   Relations between Cyprus and Israel have chilled in recent
months as Israel conducted joint military maneuvers with Turkey as
part of their 1996 defense pact. Israel has repeatedly insisted
that its ties with Turkey are not directed against any other
countries in the region.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman had almost succeeded in patching
up relations with Cyprus with a three-day visit to the island last
week.
	   Cypriot ambassador to Israel Euripides Evriades told Israel's
Channel Two TV that he hoped the incident would not harm relations
between the two countries.
	   ``We want to look at this through the prism of the good
relations we have with Israel because ... we treasure these
relations,'' Evriades said.
	   During the 1970s and 1980s, Cyprus was widely used as a regional
listening post by intelligence agents from various regional powers.

Two candidates run for Bucharest mayor

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Bucharest residents tried for a third
time Sunday to elect a new city leader in a second runoff between
the incumbent may and the director of the city's hospital.
	   Incumbent Mayor Viorel Lis and Sorin Oprescu finished well ahead
of 20 other contenders for the post in the first runoff one week
ago, which was called after the initial election was declared
invalid because not enough people voted. Lis led last week with
45.6 percent of the vote, well ahead of Oprescu with 26.3 percent,
but short of the required 50 percent, forcing the runoff to be
repeated.
	   Polls opened at 6 a.m. (0400 GMT) and were to close at 9 p.m.
(1900 GMT) Sunday. Some 1.7 million people were expected to vote
Sunday but officials predicted turnout would be low.
	   To win, a candidate needs more votes than its contender and the
ballot would be considered valid, despite low turnout.
	   ``By 6 p.m. (1600 GMT) some 29 percent of the voters had cast
their ballots,'' said Elena Dumitru from Bucharest's election
bureau.
	   Lis, 55, was the previous mayor's deputy and has been running
the city since April. He is the main political force of the ruling
coalition, the Democratic Convention, and is considered the main
favorite.
	   ``I'm not making promises, because I'm already doing something
for people,'' Lis told reporters after he voted early Sunday.
	   Oprescu, 47, is director for the Municipal Hospital in
Bucharest. He is supported by the former ruling party, the Social
Democracy Party and by the nationalist forces in Parliament.
	   ``Together we can pass over the hardships of the coming
winter,'' Oprescu said after casting his ballot.
	   Bucharest, a city of 3 million, is overcrowded and plagued with
a poor water supply, deteriorated roads and pollution. Since 1989
many problems have gotten worse, as the city's population has
increased.
	   The ballot for mayor became necessary when Bucharest's last
elected mayor Victor Ciorbea became prime minister in 1996. He
resigned from that job in April, quitting the post of mayor at the
same time.

Leader of first Everest conquest dies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with reaction from queen, expedition member, more
background; note language in graf 4 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ John Hunt, leader of the British expedition which
first climbed Mount Everest, has died at age 88.
	   Hunt died at his home in Henley-on-Thames Saturday night, said
his daughter, Sally Nesbitt. The family's announcement on Sunday
said only that Hunt died following a brief illness.
	   As leader of the expedition in 1953, Hunt decided it was his
responsibility to remain at base camp while Edmund Hillary and
Tenzing Norgay climbed the last 400 feet (120 m) to the summit.
	   Hunt recalled that he wept for joy when he heard Hillary's boast
_ ``Well, we knocked the bastard off!'' _ as he returned from the
summit on May 29. Hunt said it was the greatest moment of his life,
even though there was a sense of personal disappointment.
	   ``It was my ambition just as much as everybody else's in the
party to be first at the top,'' he said in an interview with the
Evening News in 1978.
	   ``I thought about it a lot and concluded that it was important
for the leader to be in a position where he could exercise some
control if necessary. It did not seem that I could do both.''
	   In fact, Hunt and two other members of the team made the first
attempt on the south col, but stopped 400 feet (120 m) short of the
summit. They left their equipment and supplies for Hillary and
Tenzing to make the second attempt.
	   Had they failed, Hunt said he was prepared to lead a third
assault on the peak.
	   ``He was a great team leader and he was able to bring people in,
myself and Hillary both being New Zealanders, and make us all feel
bound together,'' said expedition member George Lowe. ``What he
achieved with us on Everest was that he had a group of prima donnas
who all wanted to be the first to the top and he made us a team.''
	   Hunt harbored mystical feelings about mountains, especially
Everest. After his first daughter was born in 1936 in the Indian
city of Darjeeling, hunt set off on a brisk walk in the early hours
of the morning. He reached a hilltop about 10 miles (15 kms) away
in time to see Everest looming above the mist in the dawn light.
	   ``It was an expression of joy, I suppose,'' he said in an
interview with The Guardian in 1978. '' ... There was only one
thing to do. One could almost say one was giving thanks.''
	   ``The Ascent of Everest,'' the book Hunt published shortly after
the expedition, reflected his belief that it would be wrong to
boast of ``conquest.''
	   ``The relationship between a man and what he does on a mountain
is one of humility,'' Hunt said in an interview with The Guardian
in 1978.
	   ``They make you feel small, mountains, which is a salutary
feeling. And therefore, to feel that you've conquered them is a
presumption.''
	   Hunt was a colonel in the British Army when he was tapped to
lead the Everest expedition. He later felt that his
mountain-climbing fame thwarted his ambitions of reaching the
highest ranks of the army, and he retired in 1956 to become the
first director of the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme promoted by
Prince Philip.
	   He was knighted in 1953 and elevated in 1966 to the House of
Lords, where he took the tittle of Baron Hunt of Llanfairwaterdine.
He was a personal adviser to Prime Minister Harold Wilson during
the Nigerian civil war in the late 1960s and directed British
relief missions to that country.
	   Buckingham Palace said Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were
``very sad'' to learn of Hunt's death.
	   ``The conquest of Everest was an early landmark of the queen's
reign and Lord Hunt brought the same spirit of adventure and
leadership to many other areas of national life,'' the palace's
statement said.
	   Hunt is survived by his wife Joy, whom he married in 1936, and
their four daughters. Funeral arrangements were not announced.

Saudi Arabia beats Emirates 1-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Forward Ali Fahayd scored a header in the
19th minute to give Saudi Arabia a 1-0 victory over the United Arab
Emirates on Sunday, moving the kingdom a step closer to lifting the
six-nation Gulf cup.
	   Sunday's win gives Saudi Arabia the top stand with 10 points,
followed by the losing Emirates with 7.
	   Saudi Arabia, which has been the favorite to win the cup from
the start, still has to worry about how third positioned Kuwait
will perform in its encounter with Oman on Monday.
	   Kuwait, which has won the championship eight times, has two
points and two more games to go. Its biggest hurdle will be, the
Emirates, which it plays Nov. 12, the last day of the tournament
that began Oct. 30.
	   During Sunday's match, the Emirates team gave Saudi Arabia a
hard time, several times getting close to scoring. Cup favorite
Saudi Arabia will face bottom-positioned Qatar on the last day of
the tournament.
	   In an earlier match Sunday, Bahrain and Qatar drew 0-0, making
its the seventh time the two countries tied in the history of this
regional tournament.
	   The draw gave the two teams a point each. Bahrain and Qatar now
share the bottom rung.
	   Bahrain came close to scoring several times but as usual its
players failed to finish. In the first half, midfielder Khalid
Jassim nearly drove the ball into the right corner but it rebounded
from the side pole.

Belgrade War Crimes debate: atrocities must be punished
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia must cooperate with the
U.N. war crimes tribunal investigating alleged atrocities committed
during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia international legal experts
meeting in the capital Belgrade said Sunday.
	   The first broad-based, international debate on the issue to be
held in the country accused of committing many crimes that led to
the founding of the U.N. tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands,
brought out conflicting views by local and foreign legal experts.
But there was general consensus at the closing session that crimes
against humanity cannot go unpunished.
	   ``The indicted who are not in The Hague, are at large because of
the refusal by Croatian and Yugoslav authorities to arrest and
extradite them,'' said Mark Ellis, a lawyer and representative of
the U.S. Bar Association.
	   Present-day Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro,
cooperates with the tribunal in cases where Serbs were the victims
in Bosnia and Croatia, the two former republics that fought wars
for their secession. But Yugoslavia has otherwise questioned the
tribunal's jurisdiction and refuses to indict three army officers
wanted for alleged war crimes in Croatia.
	   Last week, it also refused to allow U.N. investigators to probe
recent alleged atrocities in Serbia's southern Kosovo province
where ethnic Albanian separatists are fighting government forces.
	   ``The tribunal was founded to satanize Serbs,'' said Miodrag
Mitic, a former legal advisor in Yugoslavia's foreign ministry,
echoing the official line of President Slobodan Milosevic's
authorities. He said such crimes should be handled locally, arguing
that the U.N. court was influenced by powerful countries that
generally dominate the international body.
	   Yugoslavia has refused to extradite indicted suspects saying its
constitution does not envisage extradition of its citizens to a
foreign country.
	   Djordje Djurisic, a Belgrade-based lawyer, said the argument is
weak because the extraditions are demanded to an international
court, not just to another country. ``There is clear obligation by
this state to cooperate with The Hague tribunal,'' stemming from
Milosevic's signature on the 1995 Dayton peace agreement, he said.
Dayton also included the obligation to help investigate the war
crimes.
	   Despite objections with the tribunal, Yugoslav authorities
allowed the two-day discussions, organized by the Belgrade-based,
non-governmental Humanitarian Law Center to take place without any
problems. State-run media largely ignored the event.
	   On Saturday, David Scheffer, the U.S. State Department's
ambassador at large for war crimes, demanded Yugoslavia's full
cooperation. He is to visit Kosovo Monday to meet with both sides
in the conflict there, Serbs and ethnic Albanians.

link this issue with the government of Israel,'' the Cypriot
Justice Ministry said Sunday.
	   There were no other details. A Cypriot police source, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said the Israelis were suspected of
spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern
third of Cyprus in 1974.
	   The Israelis were arrested Saturday in a small community of Ziyi
near the southern coastal resort of Larnaca. Cypriot police said
they found cameras, wireless instruments, tapes of conversations
between police, radio scanners and maps in the apartment the two
were renting.
	   The Israelis were visited Saturday and Sunday by Israeli
consulate officials.
	   Israel TV said the two men arrived three weeks ago during a
military training exercise in the area.
	   Turkey has significantly increased military cooperation with
Israel in the past two years. Israeli military analyst Ron Ben
Yishai, writing in the Yediot Ahronoth newspaper, suggested the
arrests were meant as a warning to Israel not to cooperate with
Turkey in any spy operation.
	   Israel has repeatedly insisted that its ties with Turkey are not
directed against any other countries in the region.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman had almost succeeded in patching
up relations with Cyprus with a three-day visit to the island last
week.
	   Cypriot ambassador to Israel Euripides Evriades told Israel's
Channel Two TV that he hoped the incident would not harm relations
between the two countries.
	   ``We want to look at this through the prism of the good
relations we have with Israel because ... we treasure these
relations,'' Evriades said.
	   During the 1970s and 1980s, Cyprus was widely used as a regional
listening post by intelligence agents from various regional powers.
	   Cypriot police said the two men would be brought before a remand
hearing Nov. 16.

Rescuers cancel search for 15 sailors off South African coast

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Rescuers called off a two-day
search on Sunday for 15 crew members from a trawler that capsized
off the Indian Ocean coast of South Africa, an official said.
	   Air Force spokeswoman Laverne Machine said that two Air Force
planes had returned to their bases.
	   ``The search was quite intensive and harbor authorities probably
felt if there was anyone to find, we would have done so by now,''
Machine said.
	   The Greek captain, Stamatis Stogiannos, 58, was picked up alive
near the St. Lucia lighthouse on Saturday. His trawler sailed from
Mozambique headed for Durban last week.
	   ``The ship overturned and sank within 30 seconds, according to
information from the survivor. The guys didn't have much of a
chance to get into life rafts,'' said Neil Brink, a port official
at Richard's Bay.
	   Another official said the search was called off after nightfall
on Sunday.
	   ``It is unlikely the search will continue on Monday unless new
information comes to light overnight,'' said Richard's Bay harbor
pilot Keith Marks.
	   The 28-meter (84-foot) trawler Daniela, registered to a Greek
company in the South African port of Durban, appears to have sunk
on Saturday, not on Friday as initial reports indicated, the South
African Press Association reported.
	   Brink said search vehicles found debris including two lifebouys,
two life jackets, and plastic and wooden items.

Germany's gaze is on future as nation recalls Nazi terror
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES and RECASTS with more quotes, background.
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Sixty years ago Monday, Nazi thugs torched
synagogues, looted Jewish stores and attacked Jews in a night of
terror that presaged the Holocaust.
	   Germany's remembrance of the Nov. 9, 1938 rampage known as
``Kristallnacht'' comes amid fresh debate on the nation's
relationship with its past, triggered by the return of its seat of
power to Berlin, the prewar capital from which Adolf Hitler ruled.
	   Barely in office, a newly elected, younger government due to
settle into the city next year is trying to lighten the burden of
association on the future ``Berlin Republic.'' Already, a German
Jewish leader has bitterly voiced concern about a new
``intellectual nationalism.''
	   Gerhard Schroeder, the first chancellor with no personal memory
of World War II, embodies the shift in attitudes toward the Nazi
legacy by a generation that wants Germany to be seen simply as a
normal country.
	   Schroeder stressed that point in a recent TV interview when the
host noted that some of the Berlin government buildings had been
used by the Nazis.
	   ``One must know that we have to stand for `never again.' But it
would be completely wrong to allow yourself be so burdened as to
make it impossible to bring a new spirit to those hallways,'' he
said.
	   ``My way of making politics, of dealing with people, doesn't
change when I enter some strange building,'' he said.
	   Marking what's also known as the Night of Broken Glass,
Schroeder said Nov. 9 would remain linked to unprecedented crimes
and immense suffering.
	   But he also said: ``Sixty years later we look forward, without
forgetting the past.''
	   President Roman Herzog, Germany's head of state, will share the
main remembrance ceremony Monday in Berlin with Ignatz Bubis, head
of Germany's Jewish community.
	   Some of Germany's 70,000 Jews will commemorate Kristallnacht
with street marches for the first time, a sign of leaders' concern
that less visible forms of remembrance are wearing thin. The main
procession is through central Berlin.
	   In Dresden, the city's small Jewish community will break ground
Monday for a new synagogue to replace the one burned by the Nazis.
	   Several other big-city synagogues are being rebuilt only as
computer models for now. Students in Darmstadt have been working on
the project since summer, recreating the buildings from blueprints,
photos and descriptions by survivors.
	   Meant as a gesture against rising extreme-right violence in
Germany, the reconstructions are being posted on the Internet.
	   In the real world, Bubis recently said he is so upset with the
national mood that he was considering stepping down as Jewish
leader.
	   Triggering his outrage was a speech last month by Martin Walser,
a prize-winning novelist who has delved into how Germans deal with
the Nazi past. Walser, 71, suggested that Germany no longer should
wallow in shame about Auschwitz.
	   ``Intellectual nationalism is on the rise,'' said Bubis, who
lost his father and two siblings in Nazi death camps.
	   Kristallnacht, less than a year before World War II started with
the German invasion of Poland, was the Nazis' reprisal for the
shooting of a German diplomat in Paris by a young Jew.
	   Nazi leaders heard the news while marking another Nov. 9
anniversary _ a 1923 coup attempt by Hitler _ and ordered local
thugs out into the streets.
	   Several hundred people were killed or committed suicide in the
days after the rampage in Germany and Austria, which Hitler had
annexed in March 1938. Some 30,000 Jewish men were dragged to Nazi
concentration camps, though most were later let go.
	   Today, some say Kristallnacht risks being eclipsed by another
watershed in German history _ the Nov. 9, 1989 fall of the Berlin
Wall, which led to German reunification the next year and set the
stage for the capital's return to Berlin.
	   For his part, Schroeder said the move to Berlin is not the
return to the Third Reich's capital or the heart of the Prussian
military state, but rather to a place symbolizing the joining of
East and West in a city that was once divided.
	   The new chancellor has not been as explicit as Walser in his
view of the new Germany, but he doesn't disagree with the author,
either.
	   ``A writer must be allowed to say such a thing _ but not the
chancellor,'' he said.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Italian league leader Fiorentina was kicked out of
this season's European club competition Sunday in punishment for
the explosion that injured a match official and caused the
suspension of a UEFA Cup game last week.
	   Fiorentina immediately announced it would appeal. If that fails,
it will be Grasshoppers of Zurich that advance to the third round
of the UEFA Cup against France's Bordeaux.
	   ``Fiorentina was responsible for order and security both inside
and around the stadium, before during and after the match and
therefore liable for incidents of any kind,'' said UEFA's Control
and Disciplinary Commission.
	   ``Had there not been mitigating circumstances, Fiorentina AC
would have been excluded from future UEFA club competitions as
well,'' it said.
	   Specifically it cited the fact that it was apparently a
supporter of Fiorentina's Italian rival, Salerna, who threw the
device. The match was held at Salerna, near Naples in southern
Italy.
	   Fiorentina was leading 2-1 after the first 45 minutes of play.
Having won the first leg against the Swiss side 2-0, it expected
easily to advance to the third round of the UEFA Cup.
	   But the match was suspended after a Belgian off-field official
was injured by the device hurled from the stands at the interval.
	   Philippe Flament, the ``fourth man,'' who helps the referee and
linesmen, was taken to hospital with a right knee injury. Several
players were temporarily deafened.
	   The game was being played in Salerno because Fiorentina was
paying the second and last round of suspension of its Franchi
stadium as a result of fan violence during a 1997 Cup Winners Cup
game.
	   UEFA said Fiorentina's previous bad record had been taken into
account on deciding on the expulsion.
	   Fiorentina and Salerno fans have a history of bitterness. But
Fiorentina club wanted to raise funds for victims of recent
flooding in southern Italy and so played at its rival's grounds.
	   Italian papers reported that police questioned a local Salerno
man who was a suspect.
	   Luciano Luna, Fiorentina's administrator, said his club would
appeal by the Wednesday midnight deadline. The appeal is likely to
be heard next weekend.
	   ``The bomb was aimed at Fiorentina, not against the referees and
not against the Grasshoppers players,'' he said.
	   Luna was called into the disciplinary commission's meeting at a
Geneva airport hotel to be told of the decision after the
three-hour session.
	   ``We welcome the decision of UEFA and think it's a sensible
decision given the circumstances,'' said Grasshoppers' president
Romano Spadaro.
	   ``We are looking forward to playing against Bordeaux,'' he said.
The third round takes place Nov. 24 and Dec. 8.
	   The UEFA Cup is the least lucrative of the three European club
tournaments. But even so, it is still an important money-spinner
for the clubs.
	   Fiorentina is still on course for a place in next season's
European Cup. It recovered its place at the top of the Italian
league Sunday with a 4-1 win over last-place Venezia.
	   Fiorentina had lost two of its last three games to fall from the
top spot.

Right's black sheep founds new movement, eyes far-right voters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DENIS BOULARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Former Defense Minister Charles Millon, a political
black sheep since accepting far-right votes last spring in a
regional election, formally created his own movement Sunday that he
hopes will scoop up followers of France's extreme right.
	   ``We want all voters to be taken into account,'' Millon said in
an address before some 5,000 sympathizers at a congress to found
his new movement, called simply ``La Droit,'' or The Right.
	   ``There are neither impure votes nor voters to be rejected,'' he
said. There are only ``unacceptable doctrines.''
	   Millon, a centrist, threw the mainstream right into chaos in
April by accepting votes of the extreme-right National Front party
to win the presidency of the regional council of the Rhone-Alpes
region of southeast France.
	   At Sunday's congress, Millon called for a ``united right''
bringing together all non-leftist parties.
	   It is ``a curious way to unify the opposition by creating one
more party,'' Philippe Seguin, head of the conservative Rally for
the Republic party of President Jacques Chirac, said later,
dismissing Millon's motion.
	   During the congress, the No. 3 leader of the National Front,
Bruno Gollnish, was ejected from the meeting hall by Millon's
lieutenants.
	   Gollnish said he was surprised at being asked to leave, since
``I meet Charles Millon regularly and we hold discussions.''

polls &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A Portuguese referendum on creating
regional assemblies apparently was defeated Sunday, according to
exit polls, but the low voter turnout could void the result.
	   Two television projections estimated that between 60 and 65
percent of voters opposed the referendum with less than 40 percent
voting for it.
	   Both projections estimated the abstention rate at between 48 and
53 percent. For a referendum to be binding, more than 50 percent of
the country's 8.4 million voters must participate.
	   Final official results were expected Monday.
	   Defeat for the proposal would be a blow to the minority
Socialist government, which campaigned hard for it.
	   The proposal, which also was backed by the opposition Communist
Party, would devolve limited administrative powers to elected
assemblies in eight regions to be created under the plan.
	   The proposed assemblies would be responsible for administration,
planning and development in their areas after coordinating policy
with the central government.
	   In the 15-nation European Union, only Portugal and Greece have
maintained a centralized model of government.
	   The center-right Social Democrat Party and the rightist Popular
Party campaigned against the move, saying there was no need to
divide up a country of just 9.9 million people.
	   They insisted the move would increase public spending and
bureaucracy.
	   Supporters insisted the move would bring democracy closer to the
people at a minimal cost. Neither side put an exact cost on the
plan.
	   The ballot was seen as a test for the referendum process, which
was introduced last year.
	   Almost 70 percent of voters stayed away from the first
referendum, on abortion, in June.

UEFA bans Fiorentina for one season

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Italian league leader Fiorentina was kicked out of
this season's European club competition Sunday in punishment for
the explosion that injured a match official and caused the
suspension of a UEFA Cup game last week.
	   Fiorentina immediately announced it would appeal. If that fails,
it will be Grasshoppers of Zurich that advances to the third round
of the UEFA Cup against France's Bordeaux.
	   ``Fiorentina was responsible for order and security both inside
and around the stadium, before during and after the match and
therefore liable for incidents of any kind,'' said UEFA's Control
and Disciplinary Commission.
	   ``Had there not been mitigating circumstances, Fiorentina AC
would have been excluded from future UEFA club competitions as
well,'' it said.
	   Specifically it cited the fact that it was apparently a
supporter of Fiorentina's Italian rival, Salernitana, who threw the
device. The match was held at Salerno, near Naples in southern
Italy.
	   Fiorentina was leading 2-1 after the first 45 minutes of play.
Having won the first leg against the Swiss side 2-0, it expected
easily to advance to the third round of the UEFA Cup.
	   But the match was suspended after a Belgian off-field official
was injured by the device hurled from the stands at the interval.
	   Philippe Flament, the ``fourth man,'' who stations at midfield
helping the referee and linesmen, was taken to hospital with a
right knee injury. Several players were temporarily deafened.
	   The game was being played in Salerno because Fiorentina was
paying the second and last round of suspension of its Franchi
stadium as a result fan violence during a 1997 Cup Winners Cup
game.
	   UEFA said Fiorentina's previous bad record had been taken into
account on deciding on the expulsion.
	   Fiorentina and Salerno fans have a history of bitterness. But
Fiorentina club wanted to raise funds for victims of recent
flooding in southern Italy and so played at the grounds of its
rival.
	   Italian papers reported that police questioned a local Salerno
man who was a suspect.
	   Luciano Luna, the administrator of Fiorentina, said his club
would appeal by the Wednesday midnight deadline. The appeal is
likely to be heard next weekend.
	   ``The bomb was aimed at Fiorentina, not against the referees and
not against the Grasshoppers players,'' he said.
	   Luna was called into the disciplinary commission's meeting at a
Geneva airport hotel to be told of the decision after the three
hour session.
	   ``We welcome the decision of UEFA and think it's a sensible
decision given the circumstances,'' said Grasshoppers' president
Romano Spadaro.
	   ``We are looking forward to playing against Bordeaux,'' he said.
The third round takes place Nov. 24 and Dec. 8.
	   Bordeaux was pleased.
	   ``Fiorentina is a top club and for us it will now be less
difficult to advance to the next round,'' said Bordeaux assistant
coach Marius Tresor, who was in Florence Sunday to scout the
Italian team in case of a different UEFA decision. ``Ethically,
though, Fiorentina deserves to stay in (the tournament).''
	   The UEFA Cup is the least lucrative of the three European club
tournaments. But even so, it is still an important money-spinner
for the clubs.
	   At least Fiorentina is still on course for a place in next
season's European Cup. It recovered its place at the top of the
Italian league Sunday with a 4-1 win over last-place Venezia.
	   Fiorentina had lost two of its last three games to fall from the
top spot.

Saudi Arabia beats Emirates 1-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Forward Ali Fahayd scored a header in the
19th minute to give Saudi Arabia a 1-0 victory over the United Arab
Emirates on Sunday, moving the kingdom a step closer to winning the
six-nation Gulf cup.
	   Sunday's victory gives Saudi Arabia the top spot with 10 points,
followed by the Emirates with 7.
	   Saudi Arabia, the favorite to win the cup, still has to worry
about how third-place Kuwait will perform in its match with Oman on
Monday.
	   Kuwait, which has won the championship eight times, has two
points and two more games to go. Its biggest hurdle will be the
Emirates, which it plays Nov. 12, the last day of the tournament
that began Oct. 30.
	   During Sunday's match, the Emirates team gave Saudi Arabia a
hard time, several times getting close to scoring.
	   The Saudis will face last-place Qatar on the final day of the
tournament.
	   In an earlier match Sunday, Bahrain and Qatar drew 0-0, marking
the seventh time the two have tied in the history of this regional
tournament.
	   The draw gave the two teams a point each, and an equal share of
last place.
	   Bahrain came close to scoring several times but as usual its
players failed to finish. In the first half, midfielder Khalid
Jassim nearly drove the ball into the right corner but it rebounded
from the side pole.

<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The World Bank has approved a dlrs 9
million loan to help Guyanese farmers hurt by drought linked to the
El Nino weather phenomenon.
	   Most of the money will go toward improving irrigation in
agricultural areas and providing more water wells, the Guyanese
government said Sunday.
	   The government is providing another dlrs 1.2 million in funding.
	   The money will be spent over three years. Some of the funds will
go toward modernizing the South American country's weather
forecasting service.
	   Interior communities near Venezuela, Suriname and Brazil will
also get potable water pumps. The border communities were among the
worst hit areas last spring, during the height of the drought.
	   The drought crippled Guyana's rice exports and dried up streams,
driving up costs in the gold mining industry, which relies on
rivers to transport equipment through South American forests.
	   The Guyanese Government was forced to seek international
assistance and to send troops to carry aid supplies into remote
villages.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Nicolas Anelka's fifth goal in five games gave
Arsenal a 1-0 victory Sunday over Everton, moving the defending
league and F.A. Cup champions into second place in the Premier
League behind Aston Villa.
	   Anekla scored in the sixth minute as the Gunners held on in
North London to push their point total to 23, two behind Villa.
	   In another key Sunday match, Manchester United played a 0-0 home
draw with Newcastle as the Reds slipped to third place with 22
points. Also on Sunday, Chelsea played a 1-1 draw at West Ham as
Neil Ruddock scored for West Ham in the fourth minute and Celestine
Babayaro equalized in the 76th.
	   At Leeds, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink scored in the 40th _ his first
goal in nine matches _ and Jonathon Woodgate got the clincher in
the 61st as Leeds beat Yorkshire rival Sheffield Wednesday 2-1.
Andy Booth scored for Wednesday in the third. Leeds improved to 17
points and Wednesday stayed on 11.
	   In Scotland, Rangers hammered St. Johnstone 7-0 to take a
four-point lead in the Premier Division as Jorg Albertz scored
twice on penalties and France's Stephane Guivarc'h _ a transfer
last week from Newcastle _ also got two.
	   In a match in England first division between also-rans,
Stockport beat Port Vale 4-2.
	   On Saturday, Dion Dublin, in his first match with Aston Villa,
scored twice as league leaders beat Tottenham 3-2. Villa, unbeaten
in 11 league games this season, needed the victory after a home
loss Tuesday to Spain's Celta, eliminating the English side from
the UEFA Cup.
	   Dublin, who moved from Coventry earlier in the week on a
5.75-million-pound (dlrs 9.5 million) transfer from Coventry,
scored on a short volley in the 31st minute and then broke in all
alone to score in the 38th.
	   Fourth place Middlesbrough (18 points) had to settle for a 3-3
draw at last-place Southampton with all the goals comes in the
second period. Paul Gascoigne, trying to come back after entering a
substance-abuse clinic, got the first goal of the match in the 47th
as Middlesborough finished with only nine players.
	   Derby, playing without seven regulars, won 2-1 at Liverpool's
Anfield. It was Liverpool's first home loss of the season and a
come-down after eliminating Spain's Valencia Tuesday in the second
round of the UEFA Cup.
	   In other games Saturday: Blackburn 1, Coventry 2; Charlton 0,
Leicester 0; Nottingham Forest 0, Wimbledon 1.
	   In England's first division, Sunderland stayed on top with 37
points after a 3-1 home win over Grimsby. Ipswich has 32 points in
second place after a 2-2 draw at Huddersfield. Birmingham also has
32 after beating cross-town rival West Brom 3-1.
	   In Scotland's Premier Division, Celtic stunned Dundee 6-1 just
hours after club general manager Jock Brown resigned. Elsewhere in
Scotland's top league it was: Aberdeen 2, Dunfermline 1; Dundee
United 2, Motherwell 2. Hearts 2, Kilmarnock 1.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish militants from outlawed extreme
right-wing groups handed out stickers which read ``War Now,'' at a
memorial service for one of their founders Sunday.
	   The stickers, plus a book glorifying a Jewish settler who
massacred 29 Muslim worshipers, were available at the graveside of
American-born Meir Kahane in Jerusalem. Some 100 Israelis gathered
there to mark nine years since Kahane was gunned down by an
Egyptian at a New York hotel in 1990.
	   Kahane was barred from running for a seat in Israel's parliament
because of his extremist views regarding Arabs. Two groups made up
mostly of Jewish settlers and which followed Kahane's teachings,
Kach and Kahane Chai (Kahane Lives) were outlawed after Baruch
Goldstein shot and killed 29 Palestinians during prayers in the
West Bank city of Hebron in 1994.
	   The book ``Baruch the Hero'' was on sale and Israel TV aired
footage from the memorial service showing children handing out the
``War Now,'' stickers which mirror the design of stickers from
Israel's largest peace movement, Peace Now.
	   An Israeli military intelligence report cited by Israel TV
recently said the army fears an increase in violent activity by the
settlers, especially those living in Hebron. And several residents
of the community including former Kach spokesman Noam Federman are
under investigation for inciting against Prime Minister Bejamin
Netanyahu since he signed a peace deal last month with the
Palestinians.

Russian tuberculosis epidemic grows worse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's tuberculosis epidemic has grown worse
this year, with more than 2.5 million people now suffering from the
disease and no immediate decline in sight, a news agency reported
Sunday.
	   The rate of infection has grown by 8 percent since the beginning
of the year, and the disease now affects 73 out of every 100,000
people in the country, Chief Sanitary Physician Gennady Onishchenko
said, according to ITAR-Tass.
	   According to the World Health Organization, anything over 50
cases per 100,000 constitutes an epidemic, the news agency said.
	   Russia's tuberculosis rate has been rising since 1991, and is
especially high among prison inmates, who are 50 times more likely
than the general public to be infected.
	   A governmental program aims at bringing down the rate to 50
cases per 100,000 people by 2005.

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Italian league leader Fiorentina was kicked out of
this season's European club competition Sunday in punishment for
the explosion that injured a match official and caused the
suspension of a UEFA Cup game last week.
	   Fiorentina immediately announced it would appeal. If that fails,
it will be Grasshoppers of Zurich that advance to the third round
of the UEFA Cup against France's Bordeaux.
	   ``Fiorentina was responsible for order and security both inside
and around the stadium, before during and after the match and
therefore liable for incidents of any kind,'' said UEFA's Control
and Disciplinary Commission.
	   ``Had there not been mitigating circumstances, Fiorentina AC
would have been excluded from future UEFA club competitions as
well,'' it said.
	   Specifically it cited the fact that it was apparently a
supporter of Fiorentina's Italian rival, Salerno, who threw the
device. The match was held at Salerno, near Naples in southern
Italy.
	   Fiorentina was leading 2-1 after the first 45 minutes of play.
Having won the first leg against the Swiss side 2-0, it expected
easily to advance to the third round of the UEFA Cup.
	   But the match was suspended after a Belgian off-field official
was injured by the device hurled from the stands at the interval.
	   Philippe Flament, the ``fourth man,'' who helps the referee and
linesmen, was taken to hospital with a right knee injury. Several
players were temporarily deafened.
	   The game was being played in Salerno because Fiorentina was
paying the second and last round of suspension of its Franchi
stadium as a result of fan violence during a 1997 Cup Winners Cup
game.
	   UEFA said Fiorentina's previous bad record had been taken into
account on deciding on the expulsion.
	   Fiorentina and Salerno fans have a history of bitterness. But
Fiorentina club wanted to raise funds for victims of recent
flooding in southern Italy and so played at its rival's grounds.
	   Italian papers reported that police questioned a local Salerno
man who was a suspect.
	   Luciano Luna, Fiorentina's administrator, said his club would
appeal by the Wednesday midnight deadline. The appeal is likely to
be heard next weekend.
	   ``The bomb was aimed at Fiorentina, not against the referees and
not against the Grasshoppers players,'' he said.
	   Luna was called into the disciplinary commission's meeting at a
Geneva airport hotel to be told of the decision after the
three-hour session.
	   ``We welcome the decision of UEFA and think it's a sensible
decision given the circumstances,'' said Grasshoppers' president
Romano Spadaro.
	   ``We are looking forward to playing against Bordeaux,'' he said.
The third round takes place Nov. 24 and Dec. 8.
	   Bordeaux was pleased.
	   ``Fiorentina is a top club and for us it will now be less
difficult to advance to the next round,'' said Bordeaux assistant
coach Marius Tresor, who was in Florence Sunday to scout the
Italian team in case of a different UEFA decision. ``Ethically,
though, Fiorentina deserves to stay in (the tournament).''
	   The UEFA Cup is the least lucrative of the three European club
tournaments. But even so, it is still an important money-spinner
for the clubs.
	   Fiorentina is still on course for a place in next season's
European Cup. It recovered its place at the top of the Italian
league Sunday with a 4-1 win over last-place Venezia.
	   Fiorentina had lost two of its last three games to fall from the
top spot.

Nordic prime ministers discuss their links to the European Union
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The five Nordic prime ministers met in Oslo
Sunday to discuss the different paths their countries have chosen
in relations with the Europe Union and its monetary policies.
	   The prime ministers, as well as finance ministers, were in the
Norwegian capital for the 50th anniversary meeting of the Nordic
Council, the main body for cooperation between the small northern
countries.
	   Three of the Nordic countries _ Finland, Sweden and Denmark _
are members of the EU, while Norway and Iceland are not. However,
only Finland has decided to join the European Monetary Union, or
EMU, from Jan. 1.
	   Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson said the five countries
have agreed to regular talks on adapting to new European economic
policies, such as the EMU.
	   ``The Nordic countries have five different positions (on the
EMU). Sweden has chosen to wait, and is a member of the EU. Denmark
has opted out, and is a member of the EU. Finland is a member of
the EU and has decided to join from the start. Norway and Iceland
are not members, so they cannot join,'' he told a news conference.
	   Persson said all five countries would be deeply affected by the
EMU, which includes the adoption of a single currency, the Euro,
for some transactions on Jan. 1 as part of plans to build a
pan-European Union economy.
	   He said those efforts must succeed ``because the opposite _ that
it fails _ would have tremendous consequences for our economies.''
	   Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik said even though
Norway is not a member of the EU, the country plans to voluntarily
link the value of its currency, the krone, to the Euro on Jan. 1.
	   After private meetings on Sunday evening, the ministers
officially open the three-day Nordic Council session on Monday. The
prime ministers of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania, were also to
attend, with a view to strengthening cooperation between the Baltic
and Nordic nations.

With parity the word, NHL season is a close call
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Detroit Red Wings aren't thinking about
returning to the Stanley Cup Finals just yet. Right now, the
defending champions are just thinking about returning to the top of
their division.
	   Same thing for the defending Eastern Conference champion
Washington Capitals, who have been trying to find their way after a
slow start.
	   Welcome to NHL parity, 1998-99 style.
	   ``It's a very tough league,'' Montreal coach Alain Vigneault
said. ``All the teams, I feel, are about one injury away from being
in big trouble, and if you lose some key people it makes it hard.''
	   That's been especially true of the Capitals, who have had as
many as nine regulars out of the lineup because of injury. While
the Capitals look toward better days, many Eastern Conference teams
are already having them.
	   In the Atlantic Division, New Jersey, Pittsburgh and
Philadelphia were tied for first with 14 points _ only four better
than the last-place New York Rangers _ following Saturday night's
games.
	   Only two points separated first-place Toronto from last-place
Montreal in the Northeast. A logjam also existed in the Southeast,
where first-place Carolina and the last-place Capitals, despite all
their troubles, were separated by merely four points.
	   The Western Conference was nearly as close with conference
leader Dallas only eight points ahead of last-place San Jose, the
Stars' Pacific Division colleague. On Saturday night, the Sharks
pulled out a 2-2 tie with Central Division leader St. Louis by
scoring the game's last two goals in the third period.
	   The tie was the 28th in the league with the season barely a
month old. Projecting that number over the course of the year,
there's a good chance the league will break its record of 165 ties
in a season, set in 1980-81.
	   ``Is it ever even,'' Blues coach Joel Quenneville said. ``The
parity could be at an all-time high right now. On any night, it
might take a break here or there or a timely power-play goal.''
	   Ask the Red Wings. They are 2-5-0 after starting the season
4-1-0 and carried a four-game losing streak into Sunday night's
game at Anaheim.
	   The last time the Red Wings lost four in a row? Try October 1993
_ Scotty Bowman's first month as coach in Detroit.
	   ``Not everyone on this team is feeling good about their game
right now,'' Detroit forward Brendan Shanahan says.
	   At the same time, a lot of other teams are feeling pretty good
about themselves. Toronto, although slowing after a quick start,
still led the Northeast Division and Carolina and Tampa Bay were in
a battle for the Southeast lead.
	   All three teams failed to make the playoffs last season.
Vancouver, another non-playoff team, was only a point behind
Northwest Division-leading Edmonton.
	   And Phoenix, with a franchise-matching best 6-2-1 start
following Friday night's 3-1 victory over Detroit, was challenging
the powerful Dallas Stars for first in the Pacific.
	   ``We're sick of being a below-average hockey team,'' Phoenix
forward Keith Tkachuk said. ``We've got to make the step and why
not do it this year?''
	   In the year of parity, of course.

Heerenveen goes top as Feyenoord match is abandoned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ SC Heerenveen beat Fortuna Sittard
2-0 Sunday to jump three places into first place in the Dutch honor
division as previous leader Feyenoord's match was abandoned due to
a waterlogged pitch.
	   Dutch international Jeffrey Talan opened the scoring for
Heerenveen in the 14th minute and Radoslav Samardzic made it 2-0
six minutes later as the home club cruised to its 8th victory of
the season.
	   Feyenoord was left guessing after its match at NAC Breda was
abandoned after 66 minutes with the score standing at 1-1.
	   Jon Dahl Tomassen gave Feyenoord the lead in the 12th minute
when he ran onto a pass by Julio Ricardo Cruz, rounded a defender
and the goalkeeper before slotting the ball in off the far post.
	   Ernie Stewart equalized for NAC in the 41st minute, firing a
cross from the left into the roof of Jurek Dudek's goal.
	   Referee Dick Jol called a halt to proceedings in the 66th minute
because he considered the water-logged pitch a danger to the
players. It was not immediately clear whether the match would be
replayed in its entirity or whether the two sides would have to
meet again to play the remaining 24 minutes. The 1-1 could also
stand as the final result, soccer officials told Dutch television.
	   AZ Alkmaar held Ajax Amsterdam to a 1-1 draw with Alkmaar's
goalkeeper Oscar Moens playing a starring role as he pulled off a
string of saves for the home club.
	   South African striker Benni McCarthy gave Ajax the lead on the
half hour, shooting home a rebound after Moens had parried a shot
by Tom Sier.
	   AZ left it late to salvage a point. John Mutsaers fired in the
equalizer in the 85th minute.
	   PSV Eindhoven left it even later to save a draw at FC Twente
Enschede.
	   Berthil ter Avest opened the scoring for Twente inside the first
minute but Tomek Iwan drew PSV level in the 6th minute. John Bosman
gave Twente the lead again in the 68th minute before Ruud van
Nistelrooy made it 2-2 in the 86th minute.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Striking West Indian players and Caribbean cricket
officials Sunday failed to reach an agreement to end a pay dispute
that is threatening to wipe out a historic three-month tour of
South Africa.
	   Courtney Walsh, head of the players' association, said after
all-day meetings that no resolution had been found. He said talks
would resume Monday with West Indian Cricket Board officals and he
said he was still hopeful of a settlement.
	   WICB President Pat Rousseau, arriving Sunday from the Caribbean,
headed the talks with the disgruntled players in a hotel near
Heathrow airport.
	   The crisis began Wednesday when Rousseau fired Brian Lara as
captain and Carl Hooper as vice-captain after they demanded better
pay and conditions for the South African tour.
	   This would be the West Indies' first official tour of the
republic since the end of apartheid. The tour was to start Tuesday
with a one-day match with the first Test set for Nov. 26.

Heerenveen takes first as Feyenoord match is abandoned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ SC Heerenveen beat Fortuna Sittard
2-0 Sunday to jump three places into first place in the Dutch honor
division as previous leader Feyenoord's match was abandoned due to
a waterlogged pitch.
	   Dutch international Jeffrey Talan opened the scoring for
Heerenveen in the 14th minute and Radoslav Samardzic made it 2-0
six minutes later as the home club cruised to its eighth victory of
the season.
	   Feyenoord was left guessing after its match at NAC Breda was
abandoned after 66 minutes with the score 1-1.
	   Jon Dahl Tomassen gave Feyenoord the lead in the 12th minute
when he ran into a pass by Julio Ricardo Cruz, rounded a defender
and the goalkeeper before slotting the ball in off the far post.
	   Ernie Stewart equalized for NAC in the 41st minute, firing a
cross from left into the roof of Jurek Dudek's goal.
	   Referee Dick Jol stopped the game in the 66th minute because he
considered the water-logged pitch a danger to the players. It was
not immediately clear whether the match would be replayed in its
entirety or whether the two sides would have to meet again to play
the remaining 24 minutes. The 1-1 tie could also stand as the final
result, soccer officials told Dutch television.
	   AZ Alkmaar held Ajax Amsterdam to a 1-1 draw with Alkmaar's
goalkeeper Oscar Moens playing a starring role as he pulled off a
string of saves for the home club.
	   South African striker Benni McCarthy gave Ajax the lead on the
half hour, shooting home a rebound after Moens had parried a shot
by Tom Sier.
	   AZ left it late to salvage a point. John Mutsaers fired in the
equalizer in the 85th minute.
	   PSV Eindhoven left it even later to save a draw at FC Twente
Enschede.
	   Berthil ter Avest opened the scoring for Twente inside the first
minute but Tomek Iwan drew PSV level in the sixth minute. John
Bosman gave Twente the lead again in the 68th minute before Ruud
van Nistelrooy made it 2-2 in the 86th minute.

Cyprus says Israeli spy suspects weren't working for Israel

 &UR; Eds: ADDS Netanyahu comment grafs 4 &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Cypriot government said Sunday they had
found no evidence to link two Israelis spy suspects with working
for the Israeli government.
	   ``From the investigations to date, nothing has transpired to
link this issue with the government of Israel,'' the Cypriot
Justice Ministry said Sunday.
	   There were no other details. A Cypriot police source, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said the Israelis were suspected of
spying on behalf of Turkey, which invaded and occupied the northern
third of Cyprus in 1974.
	   Asked whether the two men in custody worked for Israel, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ``every Israeli citizen is
important to us.'' He told Israel's Channel 2 TV, ``We'll clarify
this, and of course we'll bring them home.''

Rights groups appeal to Mubarak to intervene in alleged torture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Seven Egyptian human rights groups appealed
to President Hosni Mubarak on Sunday to ensure that police accused
by the groups of torturing hundreds of Christian Copts be brought
to justice.
	   In a statement faxed to The Associated Press, the groups also
urged Interior Minister Habib el-Adly and other police officials to
apologize to the people of the southern town where the torture
reportedly took place.
	   ``They should apologize to the Egyptian public opinion for the
harm inflicted to the Egyptians and to the country's reputation,''
said the statement which was signed by seven groups.
	   The issue of the alleged torture in the largely Christian town
of al-Kusheh has caused an uproar, with Egypt charging news reports
about it were designed to malign the country by claiming it
discriminated against its Coptic Christian minority.
	   One group signing the statement was the Egyptian Organization
for Human Rights, which originally reported that police had
arrested hundreds of Christians and tortured scores of them in
seeking a killer in the southern town last August.
	   The group maintained that the incident was not a religious
issue, though police were anxious not to charge a Muslim for the
murder of two Christians. It said the incident was an example of
typical police torture aimed in the past at Muslims, too.
	   The government has repeatedly denied any torture took place and
said only 14 people were detained in al-Kusheh, which is 400
kilometers (245 miles) south of Cairo.
	   After the arrest in August, several villagers from al-Kusheh
showed an Associated Press reporter scars on their arms and other
parts of the body that they said were inflicted during police
questioning.
	   There was not immediate comment from Mubarak's office on the
statement Sunday by the Egyptian rights groups. The groups have
been involved in a long battle with the government over getting the
proper licenses needed to do their work.
	   Sunday's statement also blamed el-Adly for waiting three months
before he launched an investigation into the incidents.
	   He was quoted by the state-run El-Gomhuria as saying Sunday that
the reports about al-Kusheh were exaggerated, but that he would
punish any officers involved if police wrongdoing was proven.

LONDON: (Monday) night.''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Earlier Sunday, reports at the Heathrow hotel indicated the pay
deadlock would be broken by a sponsorship deal made by former South
African wicketkeeper David Richardson, who runs a sports marketing
firm in Johannesburg.
	   Earning from the sponsorship proposal would apparently help meet
the players' demands for better pay, which is reported to range
from dlrs 15,000 to 60,000 for the South African tour.
	   WICB officials led by Rousseau and players Walsh, Lara and
Hooper, were the main actors in the talks aimed at securing the
islanders first official tour of South Africa.
	   Asked as he entered the talks early Sunday if Lara and Hooper
would be reinstated, Rousseau replied, ``I can't answer that right
now.''
	   South African cricket head Ali Bacher said Sunday he was hopeful
a resolution was at hand.
	   ``I remain optimistic that we will get a solution today once the
two parties sit down and talk to each other,'' he said.
	   Bacher, West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd, and WICB member
Joel Garner arrived in London Friday and have held two days of
informal and unfruitful talks with the players.
	   A key to settling the dispute is a letter sent to the players by
South African President Nelson Mandela. This would be the West
Indies' first official tour of South Africa since the end of
apartheid.
	   Reported solutions include more prize money, increased meal
money, and the reinstatement of Lara and Hopper to the squad. There
are also suggestions Walsh would be named captain.
	   In a letter dated Friday, the Barbados Cricket Association urged
the WICB and players to reach a compromise and said Lara and Hooper
should be reinstated.
	   Barbadian legislator Clyde Mascoll was more forceful and said
``the board should be fired.''
	   In Port-of-Spain, the Trinidadian capital, Lara's fans set up a
massive blackboard in the heart of the city at Woodford Square and
dozens signed it to show ``100 percent support for Lara and his
men.''
	   The crisis is being compared to the one in 1978 when West Indies
players snubbed the national team and contracted with Australian
magnate Kerry Packer's World Series of Cricket.

Spanish leadership changes hands

 &UR; Eds:UPDATES with late game Barcelona-Oviedo &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A solitary goal from Brazilian Roberto
Carlos in the 50th minute Sunday saved Real Madrid from an
embarrassing defeat by lowly Alaves, but the 1-1 final scoreline
lost the white-clad team the leadership of the Spanish first
division.
	   Meanwhile, a penalty shot put away by Dani Lara in the 32nd was
enough to give Mallorca victory over last-to-bottom Villarreal and
leapfrog over Real Madrid in the table.
	   Mallorca's victory left the side with 19 points, one ahead of
Real Madrid and two of No.3 Celta.
	   The income from Mallorca's game at the Luis Sitjar stadium were
to be donated to the Central American countries devastated by
Hurricane Mitch.
	   Madrid's third draw of the season was far from a lovely present
for Dutch coach Guss Hiddink on his 52nd birthday disappointment,
but it could have been worse.
	   Manolo Canabal, a former Madrid player, put Alaves ahead in the
34th leaving Real Madrid trailing until Roberto Carlos scored the
equalizer in the 50th thanks to a pass by Dutch midfielder Clarence
Seedorf.
	   In other ninth-round games Sunday it was: FC Barcelona 1, Oviedo
1; Atletico de Madrid 1, Deportivo de La Coruna 1; Real Sociedad 3,
Athletic de Bilbao 1; Valencia 3, Racing de Santander 0; Salamanca
1, Zaragoza 2; Celta 5, Extremadura 1; Tenerife 2, Valladolid 2.
 &UR; FC Barcelona 1, Oviedo 1 &QC; 
	   In four minutes Oviedo came back to beat powerhouse Barcelona
1-2 with goals by Brazilian Fabio Pinto in the 88th and Danish
Peter Moeller in the 92th in spite of Barcelona's lead during most
of the game thanks to a sixth-minute goal by Brazilian ace Rivaldo.
	   With its season's first loss, Barcelona let escape a golden
opportunity to pass over Mallorca and added another disappointment
after its defeat 2-1 Wednesday in the European competition against
Bayern Munich.
 &UR; Celta 5, Extremadura 1 &QC; 
	   After a goal-dry first half Celta's goals came raining down with
from Russian striker Alexander Mostovoi ensuring an ample victory
over last-place Extremadura.
	   Mostovoi scored Celta's first in the 48th, followed nine minutes
later by a header of Juan Sanchez taking the score to 2-0.
	   Mostovoi scored again in the 66th. Tomas Alberto Hervas notched
Celta's fourth goal at minute 81, and Russian midfielder Valery
Karpin scored the team's fifth at minute 83rd.
	   Manuel Mosquera scored a consolation goal for Extremadura in
minute 68th.
 &UR; Real Sociedad 3, Athletic de Bilbao 1 &QC; 
	   In the northern city of San Sebastian, Oscar de Paula put
struggling Real Sociedad ahead in the Basque region derby with a
goal in the third minute. Ricardo Sa Pinto added the second for the
home team in the 12th with a shot from the right side.
	   Defense Aitor Larrazabal clinched the Athletic's only goal in
the 82nd minute but Real sealed it 3-1 victory with a goal by
Yugolav striker Darko Kovasevic just seconds before the whistle.
	   With this win Real Sociedad jumped to the mid position of the
table with 12 points from three draws, three wins and three defeats
while Athletic de Bilbao stayed with 10 points.
 &UR; Valencia 3, Racing de Santander 0 &QC; 
	   In Valencia, Yugoslav striker Miroslav Djukic scored the home
team's first goal just before the break.
	   Swedish Stefan Schwarz scored the second in the 47th and Claudio
Lopez of Argentina scored another in the 62nd to lead Valencia
(5-0-4) and keep Extremadura in the last place.
 &UR; Atletico de Madrid 1, Deportivo de La Coruna 1
	   Atletico took the lead with a goal by Spanish forward Jose Mari
Romero in the 70th minute but Deportivo replied with an equalizer
from Brazilian Djalminha eleven minutes later.
	   The results left Atletico with 14 points and Deportivo with 13.
	   In Saturday's only 9th-round game Espanyol defeated Betis 1-0.

Prosecuted Belgrade daily on trial again

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A Belgrade newspaper banned for
criticizing Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic went on trial
again Sunday for continuing to publish anti-government sentiments.
	   The paper, Dnevni Telegraf, had resumed publishing Saturday
after weeks of government bans, trials and police raids.
	   In its first edition, the daily ran an advertisement paid by a
Belgrade University student group that called for the abolishment
of the existing government, saying ``Resistance is the answer.
There is no other way, otherwise it will be too late. ... This is
not a system, this is a disease ... pull yourselves together and
resist!''
	   Within hours, Serbia's top official for refugees and a close
Milosevic associate, Bratislava Morina, sued the daily for running
the ad, saying it violated Serbia's recently enacted media law by
``jeopardizing the sovereignty and territorial integrity'' of the
state.
	   Dnevni Telegraf was first banned last month under a government
decree demanding strictly ``patriotic'' coverage of events _
especially the ongoing crisis in Serbia's Kosovo province _ from
both independent and state-run media. Two other papers were also
banned.
	   The decree was then superseded by a restrictive media law that
levied hefty fines for articles authorities deemed anti-state.
Under the new law, Dnevni Telegraf's publishers and editors were
fined dlrs 246,000 for articles in a sister weekly magazine. When
they refused to pay, police raided the newspaper's Belgrade office,
hauling away equipment as partial compensation for the money owed.
	   The paper continued publishing by reregistering in Montenegro,
the other Yugoslav republic.
	   Sunday's trial, which took place behind closed doors, has also
hurt already tense relations between Yugoslavia's two republics.
Montenegro's pro-Western officials protested Serbian authorities'
``harassment'' of independent publications registered in their
republic.
	   The defendants and their lawyers stormed out of the Belgrade
district court after two hours of hearings, protesting what they
saw as ``partiality'' of the judge.
	   The judge was expected to rule later Sunday, although the
verdict would not be made public until Monday.
	   A leading opposition party, the Democrats, criticized the trial
as unjust.
	   ``It's a staged trial whose only purpose is to stifle media
freedom,'' the party said in a statement. ``It reminds of the worst
Stalinist and fascist trials, where the verdict is known in advance
and the defendant has no chance to prove innocence.''
	   Milosevic virtually controls state-run media and has sought for
years to suppress the independent media. His efforts increased late
last month, under the threat of NATO airstrikes as punishment for
Serbia's crackdown in Kosovo province.

Latest dispute over accord's provisions centers on radical groups

 &UR; Eds: ADDS Netanyahu comment, grafs 6-7 &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Setting the stage for a new quarrel over how to
crack down on militants, Israel is demanding that the military
wings of two radical Islamic groups be outlawed, while the
Palestinian Authority insists it has already banned them.
	   Implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security
accord, signed Oct. 23 in Washington, was to have begun this past
week, but has hit various snags.
	   Most recently, Israel's Cabinet put off a vote to ratify the
accord after a suicide bombing Friday in Jerusalem that killed the
two assailants and injured 21 Israelis. The radical group Islamic
Jihad claimed responsibility.
	   Sunday, the Israeli army set-up roadblocks, forbid residents
from leaving their homes for several hours and carried out searches
in the West Bank village of Kabatiya for a leader of the militant
group.
	   The Israeli army said troops had fired towards a fleeing
terrorist suspect there and soldiers found a pistol and fake
Israeli identification cards in the suspect's abandoned car.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday there would be no
withdrawal from the West Bank until the Palestinians proved their
crackdown on terrorism was serious.
	   ``They're not fighting (terrorism) hard enough,'' Netanyahu said
at a local political rally outside Tel Aviv. ``If they fight,
they'll get. If they don't fight, they won't get,'' he said.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, said that Israel
expects Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to formally outlaw the
military wings of Islamic Jihad and the larger militant group
Hamas.

On the horizon: MRI scans to find most dangerous artery clogs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ MRI scans are helping doctors predict whether
plaque, the fatty material that clogs the arteries, is likely to
break open and trigger a heart attack or stroke.
	   Doctors have long known that heart attacks and strokes typically
occur when a lump of plaque on an artery walls bursts. In a
misguided attempt at repair, the body forms a clot over the plaque
that chokes off the blood supply completely.
	   Researchers have been delving into what makes some plaque
harmless, even though it fills up much of the blood vessel, while
other bits are prone to breaking. Now, they are taking steps toward
technology that will let them peek inside the plaque to reveal
whether it is vulnerable to disaster.
	   At Sunday's opening of the annual scientific meeting of the
American Heart Association, doctors described two new uses of
magnetic resonance imaging scans that may at last allow them to
distinguish benign plaque from the dangerous.
	   ``Many of us think that the most significant clinical advance in
the next five to 10 years will be the noninvasive imaging of
plaque,'' commented Dr. Jan Breslow of Rockefeller University in
New York City.
	   The noninvasive technique, tested by Dr. Valentin Fuster and
others at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, involves
souping up an ordinary MRI machine to snap super-fast
cross-sectional pictures of the beating heart.
	   Ordinarily, doctors make images of the blood vessels using
ultrasound or X-rays that tell them whether they are narrow. But
this offers no clue to what the blockages are made of. The MRI
pictures reveal the composition of plaque, which is key to
predicting whether it is likely to break.
	   Plaque is composed of fat, calcium and fibrous muscle cells.
Researchers have found that plaque deposits in the heart's coronary
arteries and aorta are especially dangerous if they are soft blobs
of fat covered by a thin lid of fiber.
	   Fuster's team uses an MRI machine that captures freeze-frame
pictures of the heart, producing crosscut photos that show what the
plaque is made of.
	   The researchers have tested it on 11 patients with plaque in the
aorta, the body's main blood vessel. When this plaque breaks, it
can send clots into the legs or into the brain, where they may get
stuck and cause a stroke.
	   Just last week, Fuster said the team took MRI scans to look at
plaque in the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that feed the
heart muscle. Blood clots in these arteries result in heart
attacks.
	   Though still in early stages, Fuster said he believes this
approach will allow doctors to find dangerous plaque even in those
who show no outward symptoms of heart disease. The eventual goal,
he said, is to make this testing cheap and convenient enough to
screen large portions of the population.
	   Still unclear, however, is what to do about this plaque. A new
study by Fuster's team will examine whether giving
cholesterol-lowering drugs, called statins, will transform
dangerous plaques into harmless ones. Animal studies suggest this
may work.
	   Dr. Walter J. Rogers and others from Allegheny University in
Pittsburgh are developing another kind of MRI that would be
inserted into the blood vessels on a catheter.
	   Ordinarily, doctors perform balloon angioplasty to force back
large pieces of plaque. But smaller _ though potentially more
dangerous _ plaque is left alone. Rogers said the MRI through a
catheter might be used during angioplasty to scout out small but
dangerous plaques that should also be treated with angioplasty.
	   Rogers said this kind of MRI has been successfully tested on
pieces of artery removed from the body but has not yet been tried
inside the body.

U.N. chief arrives in disputed territory claimed by Morocco

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAAYOUNE, Western Sahara (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan arrived Sunday in this desert territory for a first-hand look
at what has been one of the United Nations' knottiest missions --
resolving a 23-year dispute over the fate of the Western Sahara.
	   Up to 1,000 people lined the tarmac to greet Annan, welcomed by
Moroccan Interior Minister Driss Basri.
	   Their banners professing allegiance to Morocco -- which claims
the territory as part of its kingdom -- underscored the difficulty
facing the United Nations, trying for seven years now to organize a
referendum on the future of the mineral-rich territory.
	   Hours before Annan's arrival, Basri announced plans for new jobs
and housing. The ``royal directive'' from King Hassan II includes
plans to build 20,000 housing units and provide 20,000 jobs for
natives of the Western Sahara, known as Sahraouis.
	   Basri said an additional 20,000 housing units would be built
after the referendum -- now expected in December 1999 -- to house
those ``who return to their mother country.''
	   He was referring to backers of the Polisario Front seeking
independence for the Western Sahara in bloody desert skirmishes
with Moroccan soldiers that endured for years.
	   Annan's trip here could serve as a leveler in the highly-charged
dispute over the future of the Western Sahara, claimed by Morocco
since 1975, when Spain abandoned it.
	   At the airport, Sahraouis held banners professing their
``allegiance to the throne'' or reading; ``We are waiting
impatiently for the application of the referendum to refute the
pretentions of the disloyal,'' a reference to the Polisario Front.
	   During his visit, Annan was to get a firsthand view of the U.N.
military observer team here, known as Minursa, organizing the
referendum, which has been delayed by differences over who can take
part.
	   The U.N. chief arrived from Mauritanian. He was to travel Monday
night to Marrakech for a meeting with the king, before visits to
Tunisia and Algeria, which once openly backed the Polisario Front
and harbors refugees in the Tindouf camp in southern Algeria.
	   Basri's announcement of plans to help Sahraouis was likely to
anger the Polisario.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish militants from outlawed extreme
right-wing groups handed out stickers which read ``War Now,'' at a
memorial service for one of their founders Sunday.
	   The stickers, plus a book glorifying a Jewish settler who
massacred 29 Muslim worshipers, were available at the graveside of
American-born Meir Kahane in Jerusalem. Some 100 Israelis gathered
there to mark eight years since Kahane was gunned down by an
Egyptian at a New York hotel in 1990.

Tennessee ranked No. 1 for first time in 42 years

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Tennessee moved into unfamiliar territory on
Sunday: The Volunteers are No. 1 for the first time in 42 years,
	   With Ohio State's 28-24 loss to Michigan State on Saturday, the
Buckeyes fell from the top spot they held since preseason. And
Tennessee, a 37-13 winner over Alabama-Birmingham, was there to
replace them at No. 1 in The Associated Press' Top 25 college
football poll.
	   The Vols (8-0) received 46 first-place votes and 1,718 points
from the 70 sports writers and broadcasters on the AP panel and
easily outdistanced No. 2 Kansas State. It's the first time since
Nov. 11, 1956, the Vols have held the top spot _ they stayed there
one week.
	   Kansas State (9-0), 49-6 winners over Baylor, moved up two
places with 19 first-place votes and 1,677 points. The Wildcats
passed Ohio State (8-1), which fell to No. 7 and UCLA, which
remained No. 3 after a last-minute 41-34 victory over Oregon State.
	   The Bruins (8-0) had four first-place votes and 1,615 points.
	   Florida (8-1) moved up one spot to No. 4 after its 45-13 rout of
Vanderbilt, while Florida State (9-1) also moved up a notch to No.
5 after its 45-14 win over Virginia. The Seminoles received one
first-place vote.
	   Texas A and M was No. 6, followed by No. 7 Ohio State, No. 8
Wisconsin, No. 9 Arizona and No. 10 Arkansas.
	   Five of the top 10 teams are unbeaten _ Tennessee, Kansas State,
UCLA, Wisconsin and Arkansas. The Razorbacks (8-0), who beat
Mississippi 34-0, are at Tennessee on Saturday.
	   In the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, Tennessee and Kansas State
shared the No. 1 ranking, followed by UCLA, Florida and Florida
State.
	   Nebraska, which is at Kansas State on Saturday, moved up three
spots to No. 11 in the AP poll, followed by No. 12 Notre Dame, No.
13 Missouri, No. 14 Tulane, No. 15 Michigan, No. 16 Virginia Tech,
No. 17 Georgia, No. 18 Texas, No. 19 Penn State and No. 20 Oregon.
	   Virginia fell nine spots to No. 21, followed by No. 22 Georgia
Tech, No. 23 Air Force, No. 24 Miami and No. 25 Wyoming.
	   Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer said he was proud of his team,
especially since it has fared so well without the departed Peyton
Manning. Also, star running back Jamal Lewis has missed the last
four games and is out for the season with a knee injury.
	   ``There's a true sense of teamwork in their effort and
determination,'' Fulmer said. ``It's kind of amazing when you look
at it from the standpoint of losing the most decorated player in
school history, two other first-round draft choices and five or six
other players who went to NFL teams. And playing without our best
offensive player in Jamal Lewis. ... It's been quite an
accomplishment for this team.''
	   Penn State (6-2), beaten 27-0 by Michigan, dropped 10 spots to
No. 19, while the Wolverines (7-2) moved up seven places to No. 15.
	   Syracuse (5-3) lost to West Virginia 35-28 and fell out of the
poll after being No. 15 a week ago. Wyoming (8-1) moved into the
Top 25 for the first time this season.

<TEXT>
	   LAAYOUNE, Western Sahara (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan arrived Sunday in this desert territory for a first-hand look
at what has been one of the United Nations' knottiest missions --
resolving a 23-year dispute over the fate of the Western Sahara.
	   Up to 1,000 people lined the tarmac to greet Annan, welcomed by
Moroccan Interior Minister Driss Basri.
	   Their banners professing allegiance to Morocco -- which claims
the territory as part of its kingdom -- underscored the difficulty
facing the United Nations, trying for seven years now to organize a
referendum on the future of the mineral-rich territory.
	   Hours before Annan's arrival, Basri announced plans for new jobs
and housing. The ``royal directive'' from King Hassan II includes
plans to build 20,000 housing units and provide 20,000 jobs for
natives of the Western Sahara, known as Sahraouis.
	   Basri said an additional 20,000 housing units would be built
after the referendum -- now expected in December 1999 -- to house
those ``who return to their mother country.''
	   He was referring to backers of the Polisario Front seeking
independence for the Western Sahara in bloody desert skirmishes
with Moroccan soldiers that endured for years.
	   Annan's trip here could serve as a leveler in the highly-charged
dispute over the future of the Western Sahara, claimed by Morocco
since 1975, when Spain abandoned it.
	   At the airport, Sahraouis held banners professing their
``allegiance to the throne'' or reading; ``We are waiting
impatiently for the application of the referendum to refute the
pretentions of the disloyal,'' a reference to the Polisario Front.
	   During his visit, Annan was to get a firsthand view of the U.N.
military observer team here, known as Minursa, organizing the
referendum, which has been delayed by differences over who can take
part.
	   The U.N. chief arrived from Mauritanian. He was to travel Monday
night to Marrakech for a meeting with the king, before visits to
Tunisia and Algeria, which once openly backed the Polisario Front
and harbors refugees in the Tindouf camp in southern Algeria.
	   Basri's announcement of plans to help Sahraouis was likely to
anger the Polisario.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Setting the stage for a new quarrel over how to
crack down on militants, Israel is demanding that the military
wings of two radical Islamic groups be outlawed, while the
Palestinian Authority insists it has already banned them.
	   Implementation of the Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security
accord, signed Oct. 23 in Washington, was to have begun this past
week, but has hit various snags.
	   Most recently, Israel's Cabinet put off a vote to ratify the
accord after a suicide bombing Friday in Jerusalem that killed the
two assailants and injured 21 Israelis. The radical group Islamic
Jihad claimed responsibility.
	   Sunday, the Israeli army erected roadblocks, forbade residents
from leaving their homes for several hours and carried out searches
in the West Bank village of Kabatiya for a leader of the militant
group.
	   The Israeli army said troops had fired towards a fleeing
terrorist suspect there and soldiers found a pistol and fake
Israeli identification cards in the suspect's abandoned car.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday there would be no
additional withdrawal from the West Bank until the Palestinians
proved their crackdown on terrorism was serious.
	   ``They're not fighting (terrorism) hard enough,'' Netanyahu said
at a local political rally outside Tel Aviv. ``If they fight,
they'll get. If they don't fight, they won't get,'' he said.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Netanyahu, said Sunday that
Israel expects Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to formally outlaw
the military wings of Islamic Jihad and the larger militant group
Hamas.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Striking West Indian players and Caribbean cricket
officials Sunday failed to end a pay dispute that is threatening to
wipe out a historic three-month tour of South Africa.
	   Courtney Walsh, head of the players' association, said after
seven-hour talks that no solution had been found. He said talks
with West Indian Cricket Board officials would continue late into
Sunday night with no decision expected before Monday.
	   He said he was still hopeful of a settlement.
	   ``Negotiations are still going on,'' Walsh said. ``I'm going
back to speak to the players now. There will be more meetings
tonight and tomorrow.''
	   WICB President Pat Rousseau, arriving Sunday from the Caribbean,
headed the talks with the disgruntled players in a hotel near
Heathrow airport.
	   The crisis began Wednesday when Rousseau fired Brian Lara as
captain and Carl Hooper as vice-captain after they demanded better
pay and conditions for the South African tour.
	   One of the hang ups may be player demands that Lara and Hooper
be reinstated.
	   ``The West Indian Board have conveyed the sticking points to me,
but it's not for me to comment,'' said Ali Bacher, the head of
South African cricket.
	   This would be the West Indies' first official tour of the
republic since the end of apartheid. The tour was to start Tuesday
with a one-day match. The first Test is set for Nov. 26.
	   Barrie Gill, a representative for Brian Lara's agent, said the
players were still hopeful.
	   ``The players were packed and ready to go,'' he said. ``It's too
late tonight but the players still hope to go to South Africa
tomorrow (Monday) night.''
	   Lara, who sat in on the talks with Hooper, Walsh and another
player, Jimmy Adams, offered only a brief comment.
	   ``I'm on the outside looking in,'' he said, exiting the hotel.
	   Bacher said he remained optimistic and looked for a settlement
Monday.
	   ``They (players) discussed the proposals and now they have gone
back to the rest of the players _ to get approval I would have
thought,'' Bacher said.
	   Bacher, speaking for Rousseau _ who didn't meet reporters _
described the WICB president as ``pragmatic, realistic and wants
the tour to take place.''
	   Earlier Sunday, reports indicated the pay deadlock would be
broken by a sponsorship deal offered by former South African
wicketkeeper David Richardson, who runs a sports marketing firm in
Johannesburg.
	   Earnings from the sponsorship proposal would apparently help
meet the players' demands for better pay, which is reported to
range from dlrs 15,000 to 60,000 for the South African tour.
	   Asked as he entered the talks early Sunday if Lara and Hooper
would be reinstated, Rousseau replied, ``I can't answer that right
now.''
	   Bacher, West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd, and WICB member
Joel Garner arrived in London Friday and have held two days of
informal and unfruitful talks with the players.
	   A key to settling the dispute is a letter sent to the players by
South African President Nelson Mandela. This would be the West
Indies' first official tour of South Africa since the end of
apartheid.
	   Reported solutions include more prize money, increased meal
money, and the reinstatement of Lara and Hopper to the squad. There
are also suggestions Walsh would be named captain.
	   In a letter dated Friday, the Barbados Cricket Association urged
the WICB and players to reach a compromise and said Lara and Hooper
should be reinstated.
	   Barbadian legislator Clyde Mascoll was more forceful and said
``the board should be fired.''
	   In Port-of-Spain, the Trinidadian capital, Lara's fans set up a
massive blackboard in the heart of the city at Woodford Square and
dozens signed it to show ``100 percent support for Lara and his
men.''

Trapattoni, players hope for reversal of cup ban

<TEXT>
	   FLORENCE, Italy (AP) _ Fiorentina's coach and players said
Sunday they are optimistic the Italian League leader's appeal of a
ban from the UEFA Cup will be reversed.
	   European soccer's governing body kicked the club out of the
competition Sunday as punishment for the on-field explosion that
injured a match official and caused the suspension of a cup game
last week against Swiss side Grasshoppers.
	   UEFA said the penalty was not harsher _ such as a long ban from
cup play _ because the game was held in Salerno, Italy, rather than
Florence, and the person who tossed the explosive device from the
stands was apparently a supporter of rival Italian club
Salernitana.
	   Fiorentina is likely to stress those factors in its appeal,
which will be filed by Wednesday.
	   ``We can console ourselves with the motives for the decision.
The fact that they did not place the objective responsibility on us
makes us optimistic for the appeal,'' Fiorentina coach Giovanni
Trapattoni said.
	   The game was played away from Florence because Fiorentina's
stadium was disqualified after unruly fans marred a 1997 Cup
Winners Cup game.
	   ``Let's hope that good sense prevails in the appeal. Otherwise
in an international tournament, any fan can go abroad to a game and
influence the result with an act of violence like that at
Salerno,'' Trapattoni added. ``The rules have to change.''
	   Fiorentina was leading 4-1 on aggregate with 45 minutes left to
play in the second leg when the match was suspended after a Belgian
off-field official was injured by the blast as the players headed
to the locker rooms at halftime.
	   ``Let's hope that something might change,'' said Belgian striker
Luis Oliveira, who scored Fiorentina's two goals in the suspended
game. ``In light of what we did in Zurich and in the first half at
Salerno, it's tough to accept a loss. At this point, we just have
to look at the possibility of replaying the game. It would be a
real shame if we can't.''

	   BRASELTON, Georgia (AP) _ Dudley Hart, who had won only once in
eight years on the PGA Tour, shot a 3-under 69 Sunday to overtake
Bob Tway and win the Sarazen World Open by four strokes.
	   Hart, who won the 1996 Canadian Open, had a 272 total to earn
the dlrs 360,000 first prize in the non-PGA Tour event worth dlrs 2
million.
	   Tway, who led Hart by one stroke entering the final round, shot
a 74 over the par 72, 6,993-yard (6,392-meter) Legends course at
Chateu Elan. He wound up at 276.
	   Hart, whose best finish this season was a tie for third at the
Western Open, got even with Tway at the par 4, 423-yard (387-meter)
first hole when he made par and Tway bogeyed. Hart took the lead
for good by two strokes at No. 4 where he parred and Tway had a
double-bogey.
	   Tway never got any closer the rest of the dreary, chilly day in
which a light rain fell for most of the round and the temperature
barely reached 50 F (10 C) .
	   Two-time Masters champion Bernhard Langer shot a 68 and was
third at 277.
	   John Huston, who won at Disney two weeks ago, had the day's best
round _ a 65 _ and was next at 278.
	   Andrew Coltart of Scotland and Miguel Angel Jimenez tied for
fifth at 279. Coltart had a 69 and Jimenez a 71.
	   Hart, who earned a career-best dlrs 553,729 on the PGA Tour this
year, tied the tournament record Saturday with a 62. On Sunday, his
steady round included four birdies and one bogey.
	   Edward Fryatt, who led after two rounds before fading with an
11-over Saturday, was far back at 290 after a 73.
	   Defending champion Mark Calcavecchia shot a 76 for 292 in this
tournament that brings together the past two champions from open
tourneys around the world, and several Sarazen selections.
	   Two-time winner Frank Nobilo of New Zealand (1995-96) had aa 81
and was at 307, 19-over and last among the 56 players who made the
cut.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Nationwide elections Sunday were for
governors and members of congress, but Venezuelans also were
deciding the political fortunes of a failed coup leader running for
president on an anti-corruption, anti-establishment platform.
	   Supported by millions of peasants and shantytown dwellers, a new
movement led by Hugo Chavez, who took up arms against the
government six years ago, appeared poised for a strong showing in
Sunday's congressional vote. Chavez is also the front-runner to win
the Dec. 6 presidential election.
	   With Venezuelan politics taking on overtones of class warfare,
officials feared an outbreak of violence. They dispatched about
100,000 soldiers and police to ensure peaceful voting, expelled the
local election board in the country's second-most populous state,
and prohibited the sale of liquor and the carrying of weapons.
	   President Rafael Caldera, whose army chief recently implied the
armed forces would seek to block Chavez's rise to power, cast his
ballot and declared the vote ``an expression of the will of the
people.''
	   In a country where fraud allegations often surround elections,
Caldera promised the results would be ``respected completely and in
a transparent, clean and honest way.''
	   About 11 million of Venezuela's 23 million residents are
eligible to vote, and by midday Sunday, turnout looked strong.
	   The voting was plagued by long lines and confusion over
complicated ballots, however. Voting machines that were being used
for the first time in Venezuela malfunctioned in many balloting
stations.
	   At 4 p.m. local time (2000 GMT), when voting stations were
supposed to close, election authorities announced on nationwide TV
that the deadline would be extended for at least two hours because
many people were still waiting to vote.
	   ``The turnout apparently has been massive,'' Rafael Parra Perez,
head of the national election council, told reporters. He said
about 10 percent of the voting machines malfunctioned.
	   In a front-page plea to its readers, the Caracas newspaper El
Universal tried to calm tensions.
	   ``We call for serenity, balance and strict respect for the
electoral results, as an expression of a sacred social pact,'' it
said.
	   Despite the surging popularity of Chavez's Patriotic Pole
coalition, Venezuela's two oldest parties _ the center-left
Democratic Action Party and the conservative Copei Party _ could
benefit from well-greased political machines bringing out the vote
Sunday for 23 governors, 48 senators, 189 members of congress and
391 state assembly members.
	   Patriotic Pole stands a good chance of winning the largest share
of Venezuela's congress, which is currently dominated by Copei and
Democratic Action.
	   ``I am optimistic because the people are alert, with their eyes
wide open,'' said Chavez as he voted Sunday amid shouts of ``Hugo!
Hugo!''
	   The one presidential candidate who seems to be able to channel
anti-Chavez sentiment is Henrique Salas, a Yale-educated
businessman seen as pro-business and pro-markets.
	   But Salas doesn't seem to have the passionate popular support
enjoyed by Chavez, and he does not have much political machinery to
bring out the vote for his center-right Project Venezuela Party on
Sunday.
	   President Caldera's party, Convergence, which broke away from
Copei five years ago, is not expected to be a major player in these
elections.
	   The traditional parties are expected to do better in the
gubernatorial races, where many of the candidates are incumbents
who have spent years handing out political favors.
	   Some of the candidates running on Chavez's ticket are former
army officers who participated in his 1992 coup attempt against
then-President Carlos Andres Perez.
	   Perez himself is running for senate while under house arrest in
his home state of Tachira pending charges of illegal enrichment. If
he wins as expected, he will receive parliamentary immunity and be
freed.
	   Many people blame Copei and Democratic Action for the country's
declining living standards and for squandering Venezuela's vast oil
wealth.
	   ``Chavez is the antithesis of the democratic decay this country
has had,'' said Ivan Hernandez, a 52-year-old high school teacher
who said he is voting for Patriotic Pole.

	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Guyanese health officials are
immunizing people against yellow fever after reports of the disease
along the country's border with Brazil and Venezuela.
	   The Guyanese health ministry said Sunday it is working with the
Pan American Health Organization to immunize children and the
elderly, who are especially susceptible to the mosquito-borne
disease.
	   Officials said they are particularly worried about miners,
loggers and other workers who spend most of their time in Guyana's
thick tropical forests.
	   It was not clear how many people have contracted the disease.

Namibia calls for Caprivi rebels to be returned from Botswana
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix garble in 5th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Namibian President Sam Nujoma demanded
that Botswana return a group of 130 alleged rebels to Namibia,
where they would stand trial for high treason and murder.
	   In a state of the nation address broadcast Saturday on national
television and radio, Nujoma said the group was headed by a former
opposition leader, Mishake Muyongo, and advocated secession for a
panhandle area in northeast Namibia called the Caprivi strip.
	   ``They have committed a serious act of treason and coldblooded
murder in the Republic of Namibia,'' said Nujoma. ``We will make
them pay for this.''
	   The group fled to Botswana about ten days ago, where members are
being held on charges of illegally crossing the border and carrying
arms of war. They have applied for political asylum.
	   Nujoma accused the group of launching an armed rebellion and
murdering one of their supporters who wanted to back out of the
secessionist pact.
	   Botswana is holding group in Kasane, a northern border town,
where they are expected to appear in court later this week. The
Botswana office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) is considering their application for refugee
status.
	   According to Namibian media reports last week, the group
includes Caprivi's regional governor, John Mabuku, teachers and
school children. They were carrying rocket propelled grenades,
mortar bombs and mortar launchers, the reports said.
	   The 400-kilometer (240-mile) long Caprivi strip, home to about
110,000 people, borders with Angola, Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Prior to Namibian independence in 1990, it was administered by a
string of outside rulers that included Zambia, Botswana and South
Africa.

Cyprus says Israeli spy suspects weren't working for Israel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Netanyahu comment.
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ There is no evidence that two Israelis arrested
on spying charges during the weekend in Cyprus were working for
Israel, the Cypriot government said Sunday.
	   ``From the investigations to date, nothing has transpired to
link this issue with the government of Israel,'' the Cypriot
Justice Ministry said.
	   The two men were arrested Saturday in the small community of
Ziyi, near the southern coastal resort of Larnaca. Cypriot police
said they found cameras, tapes of conversations between police,
radio scanners and maps in the apartment the two were renting.
	   Israel TV said the two men arrived three weeks ago during a
military training exercise in the area.
	   Asked whether the two men in custody worked for Israel, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ``every Israeli citizen is
important to us.''
	   ``We'll clarify this, and of course we'll bring them home,''
Netanyahu told Israel's Channel 2 TV.
	   Israeli consulate officials visited the men Saturday and Sunday.
	   A Cypriot police source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the Israelis were suspected of spying for Turkey, which
invaded and occupied the northern third of Cyprus in 1974.
	   Turkey has increased military cooperation with Israel in the
past two years, chilling Israel's relations with Cyprus. Israel has
insisted that its ties with Turkey are not directed against any
other countries in the region.
	   Some Israeli press reports speculated about whether the pair's
presence had anything to do with Cyprus' recent purchase of
anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.
	   Cyprus fears Israel is training Turkish pilots how to bomb the
missile batteries once they are installed. Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides reaffirmed Saturday that his government would
deploy the missiles.
	   The arrest came three days after Israeli President Ezer Weizman
ended a three-day visit to the island. The visit, the first by an
Israeli president, was hailed as ushering in a new era in the
lukewarm relations between the two countries.
	   Cyprus' ambassador to Israel said he hoped the arrests won't
further harm relations between the countries.
	   ``We want to look at this through the prism of the good
relations we have with Israel because ... we treasure these
relations,'' Euripides Evriades told Israel's Channel Two TV.
	   A hearing for the two men was scheduled Nov. 16.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil plans to slash spending on
infrastructure projects by 50 percent as part of its austerity
program, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   A total of dlrs 2.5 billion in spending will be cut from next
year's budget, said the O Folha de Sao Paulo daily.
	   The newspaper said the government had made a special effort to
protect spending on health and education but did not say how deep
the cuts would be. It said the government will announce the cuts on
Monday.
	   Brazil announced its austerity plan last month, saying it
planned to reduce 1999's budget by dlrs 5.4 billion and raise
taxes. The plan needs congressional approval.

elderly, who are especially susceptible to the mosquito-borne
disease.
	   Officials said they are particularly worried about miners,
loggers and other workers who spend most of their time in Guyana's
thick tropical forests.
	   It was not clear how many people have contracted the disease.
	   ___
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The World Bank has approved a dlrs 9
million loan to help Guyanese farmers hurt by drought linked to the
El Nino weather phenomenon.
	   Most of the money will go toward improving irrigation in
agricultural areas and to providing more water wells, the Guyanese
government said Sunday.
	   The government is providing another dlrs 1.2 million in funding.
	   The money will be spent over three years. Some money will go
toward modernizing the South American country's weather forecasting
service.
	   The drought crippled Guyana's rice exports and dried up streams,
driving up costs in the gold mining industry, which relies on
rivers to transport equipment through South American forests.

	   MYRTLE BEACH, South carolina (AP) _ Hale Irwin finally closed
his season with a victory, blasting past a star-filled field Sunday
to win his first Senior Tour Championship.
	   Irwin finished with a 65, 14-under 274, for his seventh victory
of the year and his 20th Senior title since joining the tour in
1995. He won dlrs 347,000.
	   He was five shots ahead of defending champion Gil Morgan, who
had a 71. Jay Sigel, the 1996 winner, was third at 280 after a 70.
	   ``All in all, this has got to be at least as good as last
year,'' said Irwin, who won nine times and earned more than dlrs
2.3 million in 1997.
	   Irwin has come to The Dunes Golf and Beach Club a top contender
the past four years. Something _ the cold weather, poor iron play,
hitting the wrong ball _ has always kept him down in The Dunes.
	   In 1995, he marked his ball at Jim Dent's marker on the 16th
hole during the third round, took a four-stroke penalty and shot 75
to fall from the leaderboard.
	   A year later, Irwin couldn't overcome frigid, 30 mph (50 kph)
wind gusts as he shot 75-76 in the middle two rounds. Last year, he
trailed by two at the start of the final round, but was beaten by
Morgan's tournament record 272.
	   While Irwin already had secured the money title, Morgan's six
wins and steady play gained him a following for Player of the Year.
	   Morgan appeared ready to add another victory after a birdie at
No. 3 gave him a two-shot lead.
	   But birdies at eight and nine enabled Irwin to tie Morgan at
9-under. Two more birdies at Nos. 10 and 11 put him ahead to stay.
When Irwin got his seventh birdie at the 16th for a five-stroke
lead, there was no question who was No. 1 on the Senior PGA Tour.
	   Irwin led the Seniors in putting, greens in regulation and
birdies per round this year. His scoring average of 68.59 broke Lee
Trevino's 1990 mark of 68.89.
	   ``I thought it was important to end the year on a good note,''
Irwin said.
	   Morgan finished with 15 straight pars. Jim Albus, who trailed by
one through seven holes, faded with bogeys at eight and nine.
	   Ray Floyd, the 1994 champion who was only a shot behind at the
start, faded to a 76 and finished at 285.
	   Floyd hit a tree on the second hole and made double bogey. He
dumped his approach at No. 4 in the water for bogey. He made two
more bogeys on the front nine for a 40.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Police cruised streets in the western resort
city of Mazatlan on Sunday, on watch for trouble as voters in four
Mexican states cast ballots in elections seen as an important test
of political parties' strength ahead of the 2000 presidential vote.
	   The governor's race in Sinaloa, home to Mazatlan, was the most
closely watched. Pre-election polls showed support split nearly
evenly between the candidates of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, and the conservative
National Action Party.
	   The PRI _ which has held the presidency and most statehouses for
69 years, and which has won five of seven gubernatorial elections
so far this year _ was likely to hold onto a key governorship in
central Puebla state.
	   The left-center Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, appeared to
have a chance of gaining its second governorship in the small
central state of Tlaxcala.
	   Elections for state legislators and mayors in Michoacan were
seen as a test of support for Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, an expected PRD presidential contender whose support is
based in that western state.
	   Voting appeared to be proceeding without problems in the four
states, although attempted voter-buying was reported in Sinaloa.
Witnesses said PRI and National Action activists were out in some
neighborhoods offering money to those who would vote for their
candidates.
	   Nacional Action leaders in Puebla accused pro-PRI taxi drivers
of offering transportation to supporters of the ruling party.
	   There were no immediate responses from the parties.
	   After the 1997 midterm elections, when the PRI lost control of
the lower house of Congress and of Mexico City, the party's future
had been in question. Its move toward selecting candidates through
open primaries is believed to have helped the PRI recover strength
by allowing it to offer strong nominees, observers say.
	   ``There were doubts early in the year about the PRI's ability to
win elections. Now it is adapting to a more competitive elections
system in Mexico,'' said Armand Peschard, an analyst with the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
	   A gubernatorial victory in Sinaloa would be a great show of
strength for the PRI or for its rival, National Action, he said.
	   Sinaloa state is plagued by drug-trafficking and high
unemployment that has forced many residents to move _ some to the
United States _ in search of jobs.
	   The PRI hopes internal reforms like the primary used to choose
candidate Juan S. Millan, a former labor leader, will keep
Sinaloa's 1.44 million voters loyal to the party. Prior to this
year, the PRI chose such candidates in back-room deals at state
assemblies.
	   Millan has built his campaign on stronger anti-drug efforts.
	   Many of the leaders of Mexico's largest drug cartels were born
or lived in Sinaloa, including deceased drug lord Amado Carrillo
Fuentes and the Arellano Felix brothers, now reputedly the
country's top traffickers.
	   National Action candidate Emilio Goicochea has focused on
discontent with the Pacific Coast state's continuing problems of
low economic growth, crime and drugs.
	   Everyone agrees the state's image needs a boost.
	   ``To guarantee jobs, investment, and education, we must change
the state's image as soon as possible. There's no other way. We
can't allow for the name of Sinaloa to be immediately associated
with drug trafficking,'' Millan said recently.
	   The political fortunes of three men widely seen as potential
presidential candidates in 2000 could be affected by the results of
the state races.
	   Old guard Gov. Manuel Bartlett could see his presidential
prospects boosted by a PRI victory in Puebla, whose governorship he
will be leaving after the elections.
	   Interior Minister Francisco Labastida, also of PRI, could be
helped by a ruling-party victory in his home state of Sinaloa.
Cardenas would get a boost from PRD victories in Tlaxcala or
Michoacan, a state he once governed.

Rights groups appeal to Mubarak to intervene in alleged torture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Seven Egyptian human rights groups appealed
Sunday to President Hosni Mubarak to ensure that police officers
they accuse of torturing hundreds of Christian Copts be brought to
justice.
	   In a statement faxed to The Associated Press, the groups also
urged Interior Minister Habib el-Adly and other police officials to
apologize for the torture, which reportedly took place in a
southern Egyptian town.
	   ``They should apologize to the Egyptian public opinion for the
harm inflicted to the Egyptians and to the country's reputation,''
said the statement signed by the seven groups.
	   The alleged torture in the largely Christian town of al-Kusheh
has caused an uproar, with Egyptian officials denying
discrimination against the Coptic Christian minority and charging
that media reports on the subject have been aimed at maligning
Egypt.
	   One group signing the statement was the Egyptian Organization
for Human Rights, which originally reported that police had
arrested hundreds of Christians and tortured scores of them in
seeking a killer in the southern town last August.
	   The group maintained that police feared the culprit was Muslim
but were anxious to find a Christian suspect to avoid any religious
strife in the town. It said the incident was an example of typical
police torture, aimed in the past at Muslims, too.
	   The government has repeatedly denied any torture took place and
said only 14 people were detained in al-Kusheh, which is 400
kilometers (245 miles) south of Cairo.
	   After the arrest in August, several villagers from al-Kusheh
showed an Associated Press reporter scars on their arms and other
parts of the body that they said were inflicted during police
questioning.
	   There was no immediate comment from Mubarak's office on the
statement Sunday by the Egyptian rights groups. The groups have
been involved in a long battle with the government over getting the
proper licenses needed to do their work.
	   Sunday's statement also blamed el-Adly for waiting three months
before he launched an investigation into the incidents in
al-Kusheh.
	   He was quoted by the state-run El-Gomhuria as saying Sunday that
the reports about al-Kusheh were exaggerated, but that he would
punish any officers involved if police wrongdoing was proven.

Belgrade War Crimes debate: atrocities must be punished

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia must cooperate with the
U.N. war crimes tribunal investigating alleged atrocities during
the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, international legal experts meeting
in Belgrade said Sunday.
	   The meeting was the first international debate in Yugoslavia
over the U.N. tribunal's work and the government's cooperation with
it. The tribunal, established by the U.N. Security Council in 1993,
sits in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   Despite objections to the tribunal, Yugoslav authorities allowed
the two-day discussions _ organized by the Belgrade-based,
non-governmental Humanitarian Law Center _ to take place without
any problems. State-run media largely ignored the event.
	   Though there were some disagreements, participants in the
discussions generally agreed that crimes against humanity cannot go
unpunished.
	   ``The indicted who are not in The Hague are at-large because of
the refusal by Croatian and Yugoslav authorities to arrest and
extradite them,'' said Mark Ellis, a lawyer and representative of
the American Bar Association.
	   Present-day Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and Montenegro,
cooperates with the tribunal in cases where Serbs were the victims
in Bosnia and Croatia, the two former republics that fought wars
for their secession. But Yugoslavia has questioned the tribunal's
jurisdiction and refuses to indict three army officers wanted for
alleged war crimes in Croatia.
	   Last week, it also refused to allow U.N. investigators to probe
alleged atrocities in Serbia's southern Kosovo province where
ethnic Albanian separatists are fighting government forces.
	   ``The tribunal was founded to satanize Serbs,'' said Miodrag
Mitic, a former legal adviser in Yugoslavia's foreign ministry. He
said the U.N. court was influenced by powerful countries that
dominate the international body.
	   On Saturday, David Scheffer, the U.S. State Department's
ambassador at-large for war crimes, demanded Yugoslavia's full
cooperation.

Government worker arrested for dealings with Russian mafia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli government employee was arrested for
trying to sell secret files to a member of an organized Russian
crime ring, Israel radio reported said Sunday.
	   Yudmila Kleinman, an employee at Israel's interior ministry, is
being held in police custody for allegedly stealing files on two
foreign nationals, one of whom is involved in organized crime, and
trying to sell the files to the individuals, Israel radio said
Sunday.
	   She was arrested after a policeman whom she had confided in told
the authorities, the report said. The radio said a teacher accused
of acting as a middle man had been briefly arrested and then
released.
	   Spokesmen for the ministry of interior and the police were not
immediately available.
	   Over 800,000 people from the former Soviet Union have moved to
Israel since the collapse of communism.
	   At the same time, Israeli police have said they believe gangs of
Russian mafia have also tried to enter Israel to launder money and
influence politicians.

USA ends requalifying bid on perfect note

<TEXT>
	   KLAGENFURT, Austria (AP) _ The United States ended its
requalification efforts on a perfect note Sunday, defeating Austria
2-0 in a meaningless match at the A-Pool qualification tournament.
	   After cruising past Kazakhstan and Estonia to re-establish their
position among hockey's A-Pool elite, the United States blanked
host Austria on the final day, confirming the team never really
belonged in international hockey's lesser level.
	   Defenseman Chris Luongo, who plays for Landshut in the German
league, opened scoring for the United States on a pass from former
1980 Olympic veteran Neal Broten. Frankfurt Lions' Bob Sweeney
scored the insurance goal with less than five minutes remaining in
the final period, assisted by Joe Mullen, the all-time American
leading scorer, and Klagenfurt's American import David Emma.
	   The loss counted little for Austria who finished second in the
group A rankings, enough to retain their place in the A-Pool.
	   ``It was an honor to coach such a great team,'' said head U.S.
coach Ben Smith, who led the American women to gold at the Nagano
Winter Games. ``The eyes of America may not be turned on these

standpoint this was very important for the United States.

	   Neal Broten, who helped lead the Americans to a surprise gold
medal at the 1980 Olympic Games in Lake Placid, returned to hockey
in a city bidding for the 2006 Winter Games, playing a key role in

three assists, Broten only came out of retirement to lend a hand at
U.S.A. Hockey's insistence.

the month. ``I really had no interest in playing anymore.
	   ``I hadn't played in two years.''
	   Having skated just 15 times since retiring two years ago, Broten
admitted feeling sore after the team's opening match against
Kazakhstan on Thursday.
	   ``I skated maybe eight times after deciding to come,'' said
Broten, collecting a pair of goals and an assist in the Americans'
3-0 opening win over the Kazaks.
	   In other group A action, Kazakhstan took out its frustration by
defeating Estonia 8-0 for third place in the group. Winless Estonia
finished fourth, resulting in both teams descending to the B-Pool.

Slovenia in a final dead rubber, preserving its place in the
A-Pool. Posting a 3-1 win over Germany, France finished second in
group B to requalify.

would have accompanied the Americans' elimination, Hockey's ruling
body will still have to suffer the bitter blow to the world
championships' pocket book that comes with money-spinning Germany's
failure to requalify. Slovenia will also drop to the B-pool.

USA ends requalifying bid on perfect note

 &UR; RETRANSMITS to fix slug &QL;

	   KLAGENFURT, Austria (AP) _ The United States ended its
requalification efforts on a perfect note Sunday, defeating Austria
2-0 in a meaningless match at the A-Pool qualification tournament.
	   After cruising past Kazakhstan and Estonia to re-establish their
position among hockey's A-Pool elite, the United States blanked
host Austria on the final day, confirming the team never really
belonged in international hockey's lesser level.
	   Defenseman Chris Luongo, who plays for Landshut in the German
league, opened scoring for the United States on a pass from former
1980 Olympic veteran Neal Broten. Frankfurt Lions' Bob Sweeney
scored the insurance goal with less than five minutes remaining in
the final period, assisted by Joe Mullen, the all-time American
leading scorer, and Klagenfurt's American import David Emma.
	   The loss counted little for Austria who finished second in the
group A rankings, enough to retain their place in the A-Pool.
	   ``It was an honor to coach such a great team,'' said head U.S.
coach Ben Smith, who led the American women to gold at the Nagano
Winter Games. ``The eyes of America may not be turned on these
players and we probably won't make the headlines, but from a hockey
standpoint this was very important for the United States.
	   ``I think this tournament showed that experience counts,'' added
Smith. ``Some of these guys haven't played in ages.''
	   Neal Broten, who helped lead the Americans to a surprise gold
medal at the 1980 Olympic Games in Lake Placid, returned to hockey

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Italian league leader Fiorentina was kicked out of
this season's European club competition Sunday in punishment for
the on-field explosion that injured a match official and caused the
suspension of a UEFA Cup game last week.
	   Fiorentina immediately announced it would appeal. If that fails,
it will be Grasshoppers of Zurich that advances to the third round
of the UEFA Cup against France's Bordeaux.
	   ``Fiorentina was responsible for order and security both inside
and around the stadium, before during and after the match and
therefore liable for incidents of any kind,'' said UEFA's Control
and Disciplinary Commission.
	   ``Had there not been mitigating circumstances, Fiorentina AC
would have been excluded from future UEFA club competitions as
well,'' it said.
	   Specifically it cited the fact that it was apparently a
supporter of Fiorentina's Italian rival, Salernitana, who threw the
device. The match was held at Salerno, near Naples in southern
Italy.
	   Fiorentina was leading 2-1 after the first 45 minutes of play.
Having won the first leg against the Swiss side 2-0, it expected
easily to advance to the third round of the UEFA Cup.
	   But the match was suspended after a Belgian off-field official
was injured by the device hurled from the stands at the interval.
	   Philippe Flament, the ``fourth man,'' who stations at midfield
helping the referee and linesmen, was taken to hospital with a
right knee injury. Several players were temporarily deafened.
	   The game was being played in Salerno because Fiorentina was
paying the second and last round of suspension of its Franchi
stadium as a result fan violence during a 1997 Cup Winners Cup
game.
	   UEFA said Fiorentina's previous bad record had been taken into
account on deciding on the expulsion.
	   Fiorentina and Salerno fans have a history of bitterness. But
Fiorentina wanted to raise funds for victims of recent flooding in
southern Italy and so played at the grounds of its rival.
	   Italian papers reported that police questioned a local Salerno
man who was a suspect.
	   Luciano Luna, the administrator of Fiorentina, said his club
would appeal by the Wednesday midnight deadline. The appeal is
likely to be heard next weekend.
	   ``The bomb was aimed at Fiorentina, not against the referees and
not against the Grasshoppers players,'' he said.
	   ``We can console ourselves with the motives for the decision.
The fact that they did not place the objective responsibility on us
makes us optimistic for the appeal,'' Fiorentina coach Giovanni
Trapattoni said.
	   ``Let's hope that good sense prevails in the appeal. Otherwise
in an international tournament, any fan can go abroad to a game and
influence the result with an act of violence like that at
Salerno,'' Trapattoni added. ``The rules have to change.''
	   ``We welcome the decision of UEFA and think it's a sensible
decision given the circumstances,'' said Grasshoppers' president
Romano Spadaro.
	   ``We are looking forward to playing against Bordeaux,'' he said.
The third round takes place Nov. 24 and Dec. 8.
	   Bordeaux was also happy about the decision.
	   ``Fiorentina is a top club and for us it will now be less
difficult to advance to the next round,'' said Bordeaux assistant
coach Marius Tresor, who was in Florence Sunday to scout the
Italian team in case of a different UEFA decision. ``Ethically,
though, Fiorentina deserves to stay in (the tournament).''
	   The UEFA Cup is the least lucrative of the three European club
tournaments. But even so, it is still an important money-spinner
for the clubs.
	   At least Fiorentina is still on course for a place in next
season's European Cup. It recovered its place at the top of the
Italian league Sunday with a 4-1 win over last-place Venezia.
	   Fiorentina had lost two of its last three games to fall from the
top spot.

	   If shown to be correct, the estimated death toll from Hurricane

Vikings bounce back from first loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Brad Johnson, who was hurt the second week,
came off the bench when Randall Cunningham was injured and led
Minnesota to 17 straight points in a 31-24 win over New Orleans on
Sunday.
	   After the game, it was disclosed that Johnson played the second
half with a broken thumb on his throwing hand.
	   But he also threw two costly interceptions as the Vikings (8-1)
rebounded from their first loss a week ago.
	   Sammy Knight picked off both passes and returned the second one
91 yards to tie the score 24-24 with 10:10 remaining.
	   New Orleans (4-5) lost for the fifth time in six games despite
the rally that began with Aaron Craver's 100-yard TD on a kickoff
return.
	   Playing with his broken thumb, Johnson coolly led Minnesota on
an 81-yard drive.
 &UR; Falcons 41, Patriots 10 &QC; 
	   In Foxboro, Massachusetts, Atlanta jumped to a 14-0 lead after
six minutes and improved on its best start ever behind Jamal
Anderson's two touchdowns and a defense that sacked Drew Bledsoe
five times and allowed only 18 yards rushing.
	   The Falcons (7-2) began the day tied for the NFC West lead with
San Francisco and erased any doubts that they can dominate on the
road against a winning team. Until Sunday, they were just 2-2 away
from home and had beaten only two teams with winning records.
	   The Patriots (5-4) dropped out of a four-way tie for the AFC
East lead as they lost for the third time in four games.
 &UR; Jaguars 24, Bengals 11 &QC; 
	   In Jacksonville, Florida, sparked by cornerback Aaron Beasley's
90-yard fumble return, Jacksonville (7-2) opened another big
first-half advantage and coasted home.
	   Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell strained his groin and was held
out of the second half as a precautionary measure. He wasn't missed
against the Bengals (2-7).
	   The win extended Jacksonville's lead in the AFC Central to a
game-and-a-half over Pittsburgh, which plays Green Bay on Monday.
Although they have yet to play the Steelers this year, the Jaguars
are 4-0 in the division and have won those games by an average of
30-16.
 &UR; Cowboys 16, Giants 6 &QC; 
	   In Irving, Texas, Emmitt Smith became the Cowboys' career
leading rusher with a 163 yards and Troy Aikman shook off a painful
finger injury to make two critical throws for Dallas.
	   The Cowboys delivered what could be a fatal blow to the
defending champion Giants' chances of repeating as NFC East
champion.
	   Dallas (6-3) is 5-0 in division games. The Giants, who lost 31-7
to Dallas in the third game of the season, dropped to 3-6.
	   Dallas didn't put the game away until Aikman hit Eric Bjornson
from 2 yards out for a touchdown with 8:44 to play. Gary Brown
gained 119 yards in 15 carries for New York.
 &UR; Dolphins 27, Colts 14 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Rookie John Avery rushed for 100 yards and O.J.
McDuffie caught two touchdown passes to spark an offense that has
sputtered for most of the season for the Dolphins (6-3).
	   Miami, averaging 269 yards per game, outgained Indianapolis
(1-8) 279-57 in the first half for a 20-0 lead. The Colts scored
all of their points in the final eight minutes.
	   Peyton Manning was held to 140 yards passing, completing 22 of
42 attempts with two interceptions and one touchdown. 
 &UR; Ravens 13, Raiders 10 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Rod Woodson returned an interception 18 yards for
a touchdown and Michael McCrary had four sacks as the Ravens
snapped a four-game losing streak.
	   After allowing 45 points in an embarrassing loss to Jacksonville
last week, the defense of the Ravens (3-6) redeemed itself. And
Marchibroda, in the final season of a three-year contract, received
at least a one-week reprieve from questions concerning his shaky
job situation.
	   The Raiders (6-3), who had won five straight, expected their
good fortune to continue with quarterback Jeff George back in the
lineup for the first time since October. But George reinjured his
groin and left after the first quarter.
 &UR; Eagles 10, Lions 9 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, less than six days after a humiliating 34-0
loss at home to Dallas, the Eagles beat Detroit, surviving when
Jason Hanson's 58-yard field goal attempt landed short with 31
seconds left.
	   Charlie Garner rushed for a career-high 129 yards for the Eagles
(2-7), who contained Barry Sanders until the final drive and added
a glimmer of respectability to their season.
	   Garner and Duce Staley (17 carries, 89 yards) shredded the
league's sixth-best run defense. Sanders rushed 20 times for 140
yards for the Lions (2-7), exceeding 1,000 yards for the NFL record
10th straight season.
 &UR; Rams 20, Bears 12 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Tony Banks completed 24 of 31 passes for 202 yards
and one touchdown and ran for another score for St. Louis.
	   Ricky Proehl, Chicago's leading receiver last year, caught eight
passes for 99 yards and a score for St. Louis, and Jeff Wilkins
kicked two field goals.
	   The victory broke a three-game losing streak for the Rams (3-6)
and was their first win in Chicago since Nov. 3, 1986. It was the
first loss in four years after a bye week for the Bears (3-6), who
had won two straight and three of their last four.
	   Just like they have all year, though, the Bears made it lively
at the end. A St. Louis safety cut the lead to 20-12 with 1:59
left, and later a 48-yard pass to Bobby Engram put the Bears at the
20. But they could move no more.

Asian financial officials warn of risks to recovery

meeting ends &QL;

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Top finance officials from 14
countries in the Asia-Pacific region advised Asia's battered
economies on Sunday to adopt further reforms in their effort to
restore stability.
	   Among the necessary steps is for countries to restructure their
economies and corporations to make them less susceptible to abuse
by narrow political interests, the officials suggested.
	   The deputy finance ministers and deputy central bank governors
met for two days to review progress on the ``Manila Framework,'' an
agreement reached last November that aims to promote regional
economic stability.
	   Many of Asia's economies have plunged into recession since that
agreement. Collapsed currencies, weakened demand and higher
unemployment now characterize a region that once boasted some of
the world's highest economic growth rates.
	   The worsening financial gloom is likely to dominate talks at
next week's summit in Kuala Lumpur of leaders from the 18-nation
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. The summit is to take
place on Nov. 17-18.
	   In a joint statement, the officials cited risks including slower
global growth, with particular mention of Russia's worsening
economy, and the need to speed up social programs to help the poor
in the worst-hit countries.
	   Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director of the International
Monetary Fund, noted that some countries have already reformed
their banking sectors. But he stressed the need for corporate
restructuring as well.
	   ``These are not easy things to do,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Malaysia's most prominent dissident predicted that
the country's prime minister would declare ``a state of emergency''
after the APEC meeting ends in Kuala Lumpur, a report said Sunday.
	   Former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, now on trial on
charges of corruption and sexual misconduct, made the warning in an
interview with Monday's edition of Time magazine.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar in September, saying
he was morally unfit to lead, then had him expelled from Malaysia's
ruling party.
	   Anwar denies the allegations and says they were fabricated
because Mahathir considered his popularity a threat to the prime
minister's 17-year rule.

Baby's kidnapping prompts bill to bolster hospital security
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Spurred by the highly publicized
kidnapping of a newborn baby from a maternity ward, lawmakers in
Puerto Rico are considering a bill to beef up security in
hospitals.
	   The measure would require electronic tracking bracelets on
newborns, security cameras at all entrances and a system of
registering all visitors in maternity wards.
	   The Puerto Rican Senate votes on the bill on Monday.
	   Consideration of the measure follows the arrest last week of
Arleen Silva Santiago, 21, on charges she kidnapped 3-day-old
Odalys Cruz Maldonado from a hospital in eastern Humacao in July.
	   Police said Silva Santiago, a candidate for Puerto Rico's police
academy, was being treated in the same hospital because her own
baby had died six months into her pregnancy.
	   The baby's parents claim Silva Santiago approached them, told
them they had won baby food and diapers in a contest, then took the
baby to another room under the pretense of photographing her.
	   Police allege Silva Santiago then put the baby into a carrying
bag and left the hospital.
	   The baby was found last week in Silva Santiago's house in Cidra,
about 20 miles (30 kilometers) from the hospital, after her mother
tipped off police.

Government worker arrested for dealings with Russian mafia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli government employee has been
arrested for trying to sell secret files to a member of an
organized Russian crime ring, a radio report said Sunday.
	   Yudmila Kleinman, an employee at Israel's Interior Ministry, is
being held in police custody for allegedly stealing files on two
foreign nationals, one of whom is involved in organized crime, and
trying to sell the files to the individuals, Israel radio said.
	   She was arrested after a policeman whom she had confided in told
the authorities, the report said. The radio said a teacher accused
of acting as a middleman was briefly arrested and then released.
	   Spokesmen for the ministry and police were not immediately
available to comment.
	   Over 800,000 people from the former Soviet Union have moved to
Israel since the collapse of communism. At the same time, Israeli
police have said they believe Russian gangs have tried to establish
in Israel to launder money and influence politicians.

	   WEST LAFAYETTE, Indiana (AP) _ Brian Cardinal and Jaraan Cornell
each scored 15 points, and Purdue hit five free throws in the final
31 seconds to beat the Estonian National Team 74-71 in an
exhibition basketball game Sunday.
	   Ronald Bayless led Estonia with 20 points. Aivar Kuusmaa had 19
points and Gert Kullama added 14.
	   The Boilermakers led 69-66 before Tony Mayfield and Alan
Eldridge hit two free throws apiece, then Cornell scored the
Boilermakers' last point on a free throw with 10.4 seconds to go,
giving Purdue a 74-68 lead. Kulluma hit a 3-pointer with 3.1
seconds to go to finish the scoring.
	   Purdue's biggest lead was 53-39 lead on a 3-pointer by Eldridge
with nine minutes to go. Estonia then scored seven straight points
to get back in the game.
	   Estonia led early in the game, but Cornell hit three 3s as the
Boilermakers overcame a 12-6 deficit to lead 20-17 with 10:42 left
in the first half. Cardinal also had a 3-pointer and Greg McQuay
added a layup in a 14-5 run.
	   The Boilermakers led 34-29 at halftime and scored the first
eight points of the final period. But despite 28 turnovers, Estonia
was able to remain close with 60 percent shooting from the field,
including 10-of-18 from 3-point range.

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Aid shipments poured into Central
America on Sunday as workers struggled to get food, water and
medicine to flood victims before more die in regions battered by
Hurricane Mitch. Assisting a beleaguered Honduran Red Cross, the
American Red Cross on Sunday was delivering enough food to feed
1,000 families for a month in the southern city of Choluteca, which
was cut off from the rest of Honduras until Saturday. Forty tons of
water purification chemicals and antibiotics to stem the spread of
disease were also on the way. Red Cross trucks filled with aid also
began rumbling Sunday morning into Posoltega, Nicaragua, where an
estimated 2,000 people were killed in a mudslide down the volcano's
flank. Throughout Central America, the storm killed an estimated
10,000 people. Until roads are repaired, aid workers will probably
depend largely on helicopter deliveries. (MITCH)
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuelans voted Sunday in nationwide
elections for governors and members of congress, but also were
deciding the political fortunes of a failed coup leader running for
president on an anti-corruption, anti-establishment platform.
Supported by millions of peasants and shantytown dwellers, a new
movement led by Hugo Chavez, who took up arms against the
government six years ago, appeared poised for a strong showing in
Sunday's congressional vote. Chavez is also the front-runner to win
the Dec. 6 presidential election. With Venezuelan politics taking
on overtones of class warfare, officials feared an outbreak of
violence. They dispatched about 100,000 soldiers and police to
ensure peaceful voting, expelled the local election board in the
country's second-most populous state, and prohibited the sale of
liquor and the carrying of weapons. (VENEZUELA-ELECTIONS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The leading contender to succeed Newt Gingrich
as speaker of the U.S. House said Congress must take into account
the public's view that the president's affair with a former intern
and his cover-up do not warrant impeachment. ``I don't know if he's
home free or not,'' Rep. Bob Livingston said on television Sunday,
the eve of a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on what
constitutes an impeachable offense. An independent counsel has
recommended that Clinton be impeached because of offenses
surrounding his affair with Monica Lewinsky and his alleged false
statements to a court panel. ``The charges are that he ... lied
under oath. And I think that is very serious,'' Livingston said,
adding that he would vote for impeachment ``if the evidence is
there.'' But he added: ``I think that the American people have
certainly indicated in the polls that they don't see it as an
impeachable or dismissible offense, and that would have to be
considered in the political arena.'' (US-CLINTON-IMPEACHMENT)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton on Sunday put off a
decision on whether to use force to try to reopen Iraq's weapons
sites to U.N. inspectors. In a two-hour meeting with senior
advisers, Clinton directed them to weigh military and diplomatic
strategies for a few more days. Among the considerations are that
Iraq's likely response to an attack would be a permament ban on the
international search for illegal chemical and biological weapons.
Since the end of the 1991 Gulf War, U.N weapons inspectors have
been attempting to ensure the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction. Iraq says it has complied, and wants assurances that
international sanctions will be lifted before it resumes
cooperation. (US-IRAQ)
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Police cruised streets in the western resort
city of Mazatlan on Sunday, on watch for trouble as voters in four
Mexican states cast ballots in elections seen as an important test
of political parties' strength ahead of the 2000 presidential vote.
The governor's race in Sinaloa, home to Mazatlan, was the most
closely watched. Pre-election polls showed support split nearly
evenly between the candidates of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, and the conservative
National Action Party. The PRI _ which has held the presidency and
most statehouses for 69 years, and which has won five of seven
gubernatorial elections so far this year _ was likely to hold onto
a key governorship in central Puebla state. The left-center
Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, appeared to have a chance of
gaining its second governorship in the small central state of
Tlaxcala. Elections for state legislators and mayors in Michoacan
were seen as a test of support for Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, an expected PRD presidential contender whose support is
based in that western state. (MEXICO-ELECTIONS)

	   PUERTO MORAZAN, Nicaragua (AP) _ And when the water stopped
rising, all that was visible of Puerto Morazan was the cross atop
the church.
	   Residents had fled by boat to the only hill in town, and stood
on what had become a tiny island, crying and repeating Our Fathers
in the lashing rain. Not a single house was visible over the
waterline.
	   ``This was open sea,'' said Carlos Estrada, 28. ``We thought it
was the end of the world.''
	   For three days, about 2,000 villagers huddled in the open
without food or water. The children were coughing and shaking with
fever.
	   Finally, the bravest descended into the water that still reached
their chests. Most houses were still standing, but the mud coated
everything up to the ceilings, and most belongings were ruined.
	   Worse, in a village of dirt floors and palm-frond roofs, the
floods unleashed by Hurricane Mitch had left most people owing tens
of thousands of dollars to foreign companies.
	   ``We have nothing left except the debt,'' said Francisco Batres,
60. ``I don't know how we'll ever pay it back.''
	   Virtually everyone in Puerto Morazan, a village on the Royal
Estuary in Nicaragua's westernmost corner, farms shrimp in a system
that keeps them as virtual share-croppers to mostly European
shrimping companies.
	   Twice a year, cooperatives of 10-20 villagers each borrow money
from the companies to buy the larva, feed and equipment they need
to raise shrimp, and pay them back in product at harvest time _
plus 30-percent interest per season.
	   In a good harvest, a villager can make a few thousand dollars, a
tantalizing profit in one of the Western Hemisphere's poorest
countries.
	   But they also assume the risk, which had always been small.
	   Not this year.
	   The waters melted the mud dikes that divide the shrimp pens, and
swept hundreds of millions of shrimp almost ready for harvest into
the sea.
	   Together with his 12 partners, Batres now owes dlrs 200,000.
	   Wiping his eyes blood-red from conjunctivitis, Batres walked
through his thatched-roof house on Saturday, gesturing at a
refrigerator, an outboard motor, three beds and a dresser
completely caked in mud.
	   His grandsons, ages 1 and 3, both had diarrhea, and his daughter
had gone to look for medicine that a helicopter had dropped off a
few days earlier.
	   ``The problem now is hygiene,'' he said. ``We're all sick.''
	   The flooding killed an estimated 4,000 people in Nicaragua, half
of them in a nearby mountainside that collapsed on top of two
villages.
	   But it also has destroyed the livelihoods of hundreds of
thousands of farmers who lost their crops and have little capital
to start over.
	   With growing disease and little food beyond the relief that has
begun to flow in from foreign countries, many believe the worst is
yet to come.
	   Despite their debt, the biggest worry of most residents of
Puerto Morazan is that the companies won't lend them more, so they
can't prepare for the next season which begins in January.
	   ``If they lend us some more, at least we can try to start up
again,'' said Gloria Maria Varela, 32, whose cooperative with 16
other women collectively owes dlrs 45,000.
	   ``If not, I don't know how we're going to eat.''

Surprise Sampras loss makes his latest goal a bit harder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN NOVECK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Pete Sampras has often made it clear that he's
playing for the record books now.
	   The Paris Open was no exception: Sampras knew that winning it
Sunday would be a huge boost to his goal of finishing the year at
No. 1 for the sixth straight time.
	   That would break a record set by Jimmy Connors, and Sampras
dearly wants it. But in Sunday's final he came up against an
unexpected obstacle: a much-improved Greg Rusedski, who served and
volleyed his way to a decisive 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 victory over the
top-ranked American.
	   Now, as the tennis world looks ahead to the ATP World
Championships in Hanover, Germany later this month, Sampras knows
his goal will be just a bit harder to attain.
	   ``This match was pivotal,'' Sampras said after his loss. ``It
really would have put me ahead by quite a bit.''
	   Sampras will remain No. 1 when the new week's rankings come out.
But not far behind in the point standings is Chile's Marcelo Rios.
	   ``It's a close race,'' Sampras said. ``It's going to come down
to Hanover, that's pretty much it.''
	   Rusedski, ranked 13th in the world, also has a goal: he wants to
qualify for Hanover. He improved his chances with his impressive
win Sunday, which showed he is no longer just a hard server, but a
much more complete player.
	   He always seemed to come up with the big shot when he had to. He
had 18 aces, closing out the first set with two of them, and
slamming one on match point.
	   But he also hit laser-sharp passing shots and returned serve
extremely well.
	   It was the first time he'd beaten Sampras in seven meetings.
	   ``It was a magical match for me,'' Rusedski said. ``I've never
beaten the world's No. 1 before. It's definitely the biggest match
of my career.''
	   Sampras, the defending champion here, couldn't blame his back
injury from earlier in the week for his lapses Sunday, which
included six badly timed double faults _ a couple on break point.
	   ``Greg was just too good today,'' Sampras said. ``My back was
fine. He just basically outplayed me.''
	   In the first set, the players held serve until the ninth game,
when Sampras double-faulted on break point, giving Rusedski a 5-4
lead.
	   In the second set, Sampras blew four break points in the second
game. He broke Rusedski later for a 4-2 lead, but at 5-3, serving
for the set, he allowed his opponent to break back _ again on a
double-fault. Rusedski won the tiebreaker 7-4 when Sampras hit into
the net.
	   In the third set, Sampras had that familiar defeated look. He
never recovered, despite playing a great service game to hold at
3-5.
	   Rusedski, 25, reached the U.S. Open finals and the Wimbedon
quarterfinals in 1997, and has been ranked as high as No. 4. He
confesses he was a late bloomer.
	   ``Some people just mature later,'' he said.
	   Last year, he was the first British player to qualify for the
ATP championships. He wants to do so again.
	   Sampras, already a sure thing for Hanover, has other concerns.
He has a wild card to play in Stockholm this week, another attempt
to gain points in his quest to break Connors' record.
	   ``The reason I'm doing this is I feel like this is one of the
records in tennis that won't be touched,'' he said.
	   ``Today would have been a big help. I'm not making it easy on
myself, that's for sure.''

Papua New Guinea coup rumors are wrong, Skate says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT MORESBY, Papua New Guinea (AP) _ Rumors there would be a
military coup against the Papua New Guinea government were untrue,
Prime Minister Bill Skate said.
	   Papua New Guinea's commercial television station reported that
Skate had met with acting Police Commissioner Robert Korus and
Defense Force commander Brig.-Gen. Jerry Singirok to put an end to
coup rumors and assure citizens that both the police and the armed
forces would not act outside their constitutional roles.
	   Skate later told Australian Associated Press on Sunday that he
had moved to address the rumors after several foreign missions and
business houses had expressed concern.
	   He said the rumors of a military coup had been instigated by
critics who were trying to break his government. Character
assassination had failed, so the critics were trying to find
another way to destabilize him.
	   ``The rumor about a military coup and police and the defense
force having a clash is all coming from my critics _ people who are
trying to discredit me and my government,'' Skate said.
	   ``But it (the rumor) is not true. I just had a meeting with the
Brigadier-General and his senior officers and the police
commissioner and his officers, and they told me things are going as
usual and they are carrying out their constitutional
responsibilities.''
	   Skate said rumors of such a nature were ``normal'' for this time
in Papua New Guinea, with the parliament about to start its Budget
session this week.
	   There has also been speculation about a possible rift between
the police and the defense forces after the police recently
reactivated a sedition charge against Singirok.
	   Singirok was charged with sedition in September last year after
he led an army revolt in March 1997 to expel Sandline International
mercenaries, hired by the government of former Prime Minister
Julius Chan to end the 10-year-old secessionist conflict on the
island of Bougainville.
	   Skate said the people spreading the rumors were so greedy for
power that they were willing to destabilize Papua New Guinea.
	   ``This is a country full of speculation, full of rumors _ all
I'm trying to do is kill it,'' he said.

Makinen, Sainz set for British showdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Defending champion Tommi Makinen and
Spain's Carlos Sainz are gearing up for a world rally championship
showdown in Britain after Makinen's dramatic win in Rally
Australia.
	   The Finn will take a slim two-point lead into the RAC Rally, the
last round of the championship, in two weeks.
	   Mitsubishi's Makinen won Rally Australia on Sunday in
controversial circumstances by 16.5 seconds from Sainz and his
Toyota team-mate Didier Auriol of France.
	   ``I'm very happy, most importantly because now it is easier to
go into the RAC Rally,'' said Makinen who is aiming to become the
first driver to take three successive world championships.
	   ``But it is still tight between Carlos and I. The RAC is always
a very difficult event. There is always a lot of rain and
everything you can suppose, you still have to work.''
	   Sainz labeled Makinen's Australian victory a ``scandal'' after
the controversial finish.
	   The Spaniard was fuming after stewards reversed a penalty which
had dropped Makinen down from second to sixth on Saturday night.
	   Had Sainz won Rally Australia and Makinen had finished worse
than fifth the Spaniard would have claimed the world championship.
	   Makinen had been penalized a minute on Saturday night for
jumping the start at the 2.2-kilometer (1.36-mile) Langley Park
stage in Perth.
	   He protested and stewards were forced to uphold his objection
after admitting the starting system had not been approved by motor
sport's ruling body, FIA.
	   Sainz was devastated after learning of the move when he thought
he had put daylight between himself and his closest rival in the
fight for the world title.
	   ``It's a scandal,'' Sainz said. ``It's quite clear what happened
last night, 20,000 people and the TV cameras all saw it but there
is no penalty applied.
	   ``In Formula One if you jump the start you get a stop-go
penalty. I feel sorry for Tommi but it is quite clear what happened
and something should have been done about it.''
	   Makinen denied he had made a false start: ``I don't believe I
jumped the start but I got the penalty (later reversed).''
	   Mitsubishi Ralliart team manager Phil Short said the team had
every right to make the protest.
	   ``The start signal system is not in the FIA regulations,'' said
Short. ``That is why we protested. The stewards accepted this.''

Nicotine-like compounds boost memory, could be used against
</HEADLINE>
Alzheimer's &QL; 
 &UR; By JANE E. ALLEN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Nicotine-like compounds can improve memory
and might one day be used in pills to treat disorders like
Alzheimer's disease, according to research on laboratory animals.
	   But while the finding supports smokers' contention that
cigarettes improve their mental alertness, scientists warned that
no one should ever reach for a smoke.
	   ``The relationship between lung cancer and smoking is clear and
it's not the way you want to prevent the onset of Alzheimer's
disease,'' said Esther Sabban, a biochemistry and molecular biology
professor at New York Medical College in Valhalla, New York.
	   Nor do scientists advocate turning to other sources of nicotine
before further studies substantiate early research on rats.
	   ``Certainly, nicotine itself may have a useful place,'' said
Edward Levin, a neuroscientist at Duke University in Durham, North
Carolina. But, he added: ``I wouldn't want people to buy a pack of
cigarettes or a patch or (nicotine) chewing gum.''
	   Nevertheless, the scientists told reporters Sunday at the
Society for Neuroscience annual meeting that they're encouraged
they can design medications to capitalize on the benefits of
nicotine without cardiovascular and other side effects.
	   ``These are exciting avenues for drug development, but we're not
there yet,'' Levin said.
	   Researchers are looking at nicotine because it's known to
stimulate receptors for acetylcholine, a nerve cell-signaling
chemical important in learning and memory. Alzheimer's patients
have a shortage of receptors for acetylcholine, Levin said.
	   But when they're given a nicotine patch, their attention
improves. That ability of nicotine to emulate acetylcholine and in
essence ``trick the brain'' has led scientists to target
nicotine-like drugs that stimulate the same receptors, said Darwin
Berg, a researcher with the University of California, San Diego.
	   Patrick Lippiello, a neuroscientist with R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co. in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, reported that the company has
developed two compounds that stimulate the brain receptors nicotine
works on.
	   In rats, the substances increased both short- and long-term
memory and showed persistent benefits without toxic side effects,
he said. They also kept brain cells from dying when exposed to
chemicals that normally kill them.
	   His research suggests the compounds might be taken as once-daily
pills to fend off the brain cell ravages of Alzheimer's disease.
	   R.J. Reynolds is seeking pharmaceutical industry partners to
develop the compounds for human use, he said.
	   Levin and his colleagues found another compound that stimulates
nicotine receptors and can improve learning and memory in
brain-damaged rats. Astra-Arcus Pharmaceuticals, which funded his
research, has applied for a patent on the compound.
	   In research into nicotine's other much-touted benefit _ its
ability to calm nerves _ Ms. Sabban said she is beginning to
understand how cigarettes can increase levels of stress hormones
and at the same time relax smokers.
	   When she gave rats injections of nicotine equivalent to smoking
a single cigarette, they produced more stress hormones.
	   But when she infused them with a steady dose of nicotine, she
inhibited the response of the adrenal gland, which is responsible
for the fight-or-flight outpouring of stress hormones.
	   The findings may explain why the nicotine patch can reduce the
body's response to stress and could guide development of ``new
drugs that one day can alleviate the harmful effects of stress,''
she said.

Dollar rises in Tokyo, Japanese stocks higher in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen early Monday,
pushed higher on concerns the United States may attack Iraq.
Japanese stocks bounced back after sharp declines last week.
	   The dollar bought 119.28 yen in early trading, up 1.28 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 119.10
yen late Friday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 196.92 points,
or 1.39 percent, to 14,318.89 points in the first 30 minutes of
trading. On Friday, the average closed down 218.40 points, or 1.53
percent.
	   Traders said the dollar strengthened amid speculation the United
States may use force to try to reopen Iraqi weapons sites to U.N.
Inspectors. The U.S. currency, considered a financial safe haven,
often strengthens in times of crisis.
	   On Sunday, President Bill Clinton directed his senior advisers
to weigh military and diplomatic strategies for a few more days.
Iraqi ministers said they would not back away from their decision
to bar U.N. inspections unless crippling economic sanctions were
lifted.
	   Fifteen U.N. weapons inspectors left Baghdad Saturday as the
United Nations began to reduce its presence in Iraq.
	   The dollar's move was in line with a similar trend Friday in New
York, where the currency rose against major currencies as Ireland
became the latest European nation to cut interest rates.
	   On Thursday, England lowered interest rates, following a similar
interest-rate cutting move made earlier last week by Spain,
Portugal and Sweden.
	   Lower interest rates tend to reduce demand for a nation's
currency by making interest-bearing securities less attractive to
investors.
	   Many investors have expected European rate cuts ahead of the
Jan. 1 launch of the euro, a currency that will be shared by 11
nations.
	   On the stock market, share prices started higher on expectations
the government will come up with new measures to stimulate the
economy.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi pledged in talks with former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone on Saturday that he would study a
proposal to cut the consumption tax to 3 percent from the current 5
percent, Kyodo News reported.
	   The April 1997 consumption tax increase is considered one of the
major causes of Japan's recession.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 3.18 points, or 0.29 percent, to 1,092.65
points. The TOPIX closed down 15.10 points, or 1.37 percent, on
Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond was unquoted in early morning. It settled at 0.835 percent on
Friday, and its price stood at 108.58 yen.

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Nationwide elections Sunday were for
governors and members of congress, but Venezuelans also were
deciding the political fortunes of a failed coup leader running for
president on an anti-corruption, anti-establishment platform.
	   Supported by millions of peasants and shantytown dwellers, a new
movement led by Hugo Chavez, who took up arms against the
government six years ago, appeared poised for a strong showing in
Sunday's congressional vote. Chavez is also the front-runner to win
the Dec. 6 presidential election.
	   With Venezuelan politics taking on overtones of class warfare,
officials feared an outbreak of violence. They dispatched about
100,000 soldiers and police to ensure peaceful voting, expelled the
local election board in the country's second-most populous state,
and prohibited the sale of liquor and the carrying of weapons.
	   President Rafael Caldera, whose army chief recently implied the
armed forces would seek to block Chavez's rise to power, cast his
ballot and declared the vote ``an expression of the will of the
people.''
	   In a country where fraud allegations often surround elections,
Caldera promised the results would be ``respected completely and in
a transparent, clean and honest way.''
	   About 11 million of Venezuela's 23 million residents are
eligible to vote, and by midday Sunday, turnout looked strong.
	   The voting was plagued by long lines and confusion over
complicated ballots, however. Voting machines that were being used
for the first time in Venezuela malfunctioned in many balloting
stations.
	   Polls were supposed to close at 4 p.m. local time (2000 GMT),
but five hours later a national election official said that 25
percent of the nation was still voting.
	   The official, Miriam Kornblith, said 45 percent of the vote had
been tallied, but that she couldn't divulge any results until all
the polls closed.
	   Rafael Parra Perez, head of the national election council, told
reporters ``the turnout apparently has been massive.'' He said
about 10 percent of the voting machines malfunctioned.
	   In a front-page plea to its readers, the Caracas newspaper El
Universal tried to calm tensions.
	   ``We call for serenity, balance and strict respect for the
electoral results, as an expression of a sacred social pact,'' it
said.
	   Despite the surging popularity of Chavez's Patriotic Pole
coalition, Venezuela's two oldest parties _ the center-left
Democratic Action Party and the conservative Copei Party _ could
benefit from well-greased political machines bringing out the vote
Sunday for 23 governors, 48 senators, 189 members of congress and
391 state assembly members.
	   Patriotic Pole stands a good chance of winning the largest share
of Venezuela's congress, which is currently dominated by Copei and
Democratic Action.
	   ``I am optimistic because the people are alert, with their eyes
wide open,'' said Chavez as he voted Sunday amid shouts of ``Hugo!
Hugo!''
	   The one presidential candidate who seems to be able to channel
anti-Chavez sentiment is Henrique Salas, a Yale-educated
businessman seen as pro-business and pro-markets.
	   But Salas doesn't seem to have the passionate popular support
enjoyed by Chavez, and he does not have much political machinery to
bring out the vote for his center-right Project Venezuela Party on
Sunday.
	   President Caldera's party, Convergence, which broke away from
Copei five years ago, is not expected to be a major player in these
elections.
	   The traditional parties are expected to do better in the
gubernatorial races, where many of the candidates are incumbents
who have spent years handing out political favors.
	   Some of the candidates running on Chavez's ticket are former
army officers who participated in his 1992 coup attempt against
then-President Carlos Andres Perez.
	   Perez himself is running for senate while under house arrest in
his home state of Tachira pending charges of illegal enrichment. If
he wins as expected, he will receive parliamentary immunity and be
freed.
	   Many people blame Copei and Democratic Action for the country's
declining living standards and for squandering Venezuela's vast oil
wealth.
	   ``Chavez is the antithesis of the democratic decay this country
has had,'' said Ivan Hernandez, a 52-year-old high school teacher
who said he is voting for Patriotic Pole.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Police cruised streets in the western resort
city of Mazatlan on Sunday, on watch for trouble as voters in four
Mexican states cast ballots in elections seen as an important test
of political parties' strength ahead of the 2000 presidential vote.
	   The governor's race in Sinaloa, home to Mazatlan, was the most
closely watched. Pre-election polls showed support split nearly
evenly between the candidates of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, and the conservative
National Action Party.
	   The PRI _ which has held the presidency and most statehouses for
69 years, and which has won five of seven gubernatorial elections
so far this year _ was likely to hold onto a key governorship in
central Puebla state.
	   The left-center Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, was
considered to have a chance of gaining its second governorship in
the small central state of Tlaxcala. But results from an exit poll
released by the University of Guadalajara an hour after polls
closed showed the PRI leading with 40 percent of the vote.
	   Official results weren't expected until Monday.
	   Elections for state legislators and mayors in Michoacan were
seen as a test of support for Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, an expected PRD presidential contender whose support is
based in that western state.
	   Voting appeared to be proceeding without problems in the four
states, although attempted voter-buying was reported in Sinaloa.
Witnesses said PRI and National Action activists were out in some
neighborhoods offering money to those who would vote for their
candidates.
	   Nacional Action leaders in Puebla accused pro-PRI taxi drivers
of offering transportation to supporters of the ruling party.
	   There were no immediate responses from the parties.
	   After the 1997 midterm elections, when the PRI lost control of
the lower house of Congress and of Mexico City, the party's future
had been in question. Its move toward selecting candidates through
open primaries is believed to have helped the PRI recover strength
by allowing it to offer strong nominees, observers say.
	   ``There were doubts early in the year about the PRI's ability to
win elections. Now it is adapting to a more competitive elections
system in Mexico,'' said Armand Peschard, an analyst with the
Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
	   A gubernatorial victory in Sinaloa would be a great show of
strength for the PRI or for its rival, National Action, he said.
	   Sinaloa state is plagued by drug-trafficking and high
unemployment that has forced many residents to move _ some to the
United States _ in search of jobs.
	   The PRI hopes internal reforms like the primary used to choose
candidate Juan S. Millan, a former labor leader, will keep
Sinaloa's 1.44 million voters loyal to the party. Prior to this
year, the PRI chose such candidates in back-room deals at state
assemblies.
	   Millan has built his campaign on stronger anti-drug efforts.
	   Many of the leaders of Mexico's largest drug cartels were born
or lived in Sinaloa, including deceased drug lord Amado Carrillo
Fuentes and the Arellano Felix brothers, now reputedly the
country's top traffickers.
	   National Action candidate Emilio Goicochea has focused on
discontent with the Pacific Coast state's continuing problems of
low economic growth, crime and drugs.
	   Everyone agrees the state's image needs a boost.
	   ``To guarantee jobs, investment, and education, we must change
the state's image as soon as possible. There's no other way. We
can't allow for the name of Sinaloa to be immediately associated
with drug trafficking,'' Millan said recently.
	   The political fortunes of three men widely seen as potential
presidential candidates in 2000 could be affected by the results of
the state races.
	   Old guard Gov. Manuel Bartlett could see his presidential
prospects boosted by a PRI victory in Puebla, whose governorship he
will be leaving after the elections.
	   Interior Minister Francisco Labastida, also of PRI, could be
helped by a ruling-party victory in his home state of Sinaloa.
Cardenas would get a boost from PRD victories in Tlaxcala or
Michoacan, a state he once governed.

Lightning strikes Devils 3-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAMPA, Florida (AP) _ Michal Sykora scored the game-winning goal
with 17:39 left in regulation as the Tampa Bay Lightning beat the
New Jersey Devils 3-1 in North American National Hockey League
action.
	   Daren Puppa stopped 34 shots Sunday evening as the Lightning
(6-6-2) reached the .500 mark for the first time since Oct. 10,
1997 _ a span of 91 games. The Lightning are 6-2-1 over their last
nine games.
	   Michal Sykora was attempting a poke check when it appeared his
stick hit Devils center Petr Sykora's stick, re-directing the puck
past goalie Martin Brodeur.
	   Wendel Clark and Darcy Tucker also scored for Tampa Bay. Peter
Sykora scored for New Jersey.
	    &UR; Bruins 5, Hurricanes 2
	   In Greensboro, North Carolina, Dmitri Khristich and Darren Van
Impe each scored two goals and Ray Bourque moved into fourth place
on the NHL career assist list as Boston beat Carolina.
	   Carolina came into the game with the most points in the Eastern
Conference (15) and fresh off a pair of road wins, but Boston
rallied with three straight power-play goals after the Hurricanes
went ahead 1-0.
	   Khristich scored with 6:18 left in the second period as Bourque
notched his 1,041st career assist in 20 seasons. Khristich and
Bourque teamed up again early in the third period on his sixth goal
of the season to give the Bruins some breathing room.
	   Bourque's first assist moved him past Marcel Dionne on the
all-time assist list, and the veteran defenseman now trails
third-place Gordie Howe by seven.

Vikings bounce back from first loss
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Brad Johnson, who was hurt the second week,
came off the bench when Randall Cunningham was injured and led
Minnesota to 17 straight points in a 31-24 win over New Orleans on
Sunday.
	   After the game, it was disclosed that Johnson played the second
half with a broken thumb on his throwing hand.
	   But he also threw two costly interceptions as the Vikings (8-1)
rebounded from their first loss a week ago.
	   Sammy Knight picked off both passes and returned the second one
91 yards to tie the score 24-24 with 10:10 remaining.
	   New Orleans (4-5) lost for the fifth time in six games despite
the rally that began with Aaron Craver's 100-yard TD on a kickoff
return.
	   Playing with his broken thumb, Johnson coolly led Minnesota on
an 81-yard drive.
 &UR; Falcons 41, Patriots 10 &QC; 
	   In Foxboro, Massachusetts, Atlanta jumped to a 14-0 lead after
six minutes and improved on its best start ever behind Jamal
Anderson's two touchdowns and a defense that sacked Drew Bledsoe
five times and allowed only 18 yards rushing.
	   The Falcons (7-2) began the day tied for the NFC West lead with
San Francisco and erased any doubts that they can dominate on the
road against a winning team. Until Sunday, they were just 2-2 away
from home and had beaten only two teams with winning records.
	   The Patriots (5-4) dropped out of a four-way tie for the AFC
East lead as they lost for the third time in four games.
 &UR; Jaguars 24, Bengals 11 &QC; 
	   In Jacksonville, Florida, sparked by cornerback Aaron Beasley's
90-yard fumble return, Jacksonville (7-2) opened another big
first-half advantage and coasted home.
	   Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell strained his groin and was held
out of the second half as a precautionary measure. He wasn't missed
against the Bengals (2-7).
	   The win extended Jacksonville's lead in the AFC Central to a
game-and-a-half over Pittsburgh, which plays Green Bay on Monday.
Although they have yet to play the Steelers this year, the Jaguars
are 4-0 in the division and have won those games by an average of
30-16.
 &UR; Cowboys 16, Giants 6 &QC; 
	   In Irving, Texas, Emmitt Smith became the Cowboys' career
leading rusher with a 163 yards and Troy Aikman shook off a painful
finger injury to make two critical throws for Dallas.
	   The Cowboys delivered what could be a fatal blow to the
defending champion Giants' chances of repeating as NFC East
champion.
	   Dallas (6-3) is 5-0 in division games. The Giants, who lost 31-7
to Dallas in the third game of the season, dropped to 3-6.
	   Dallas didn't put the game away until Aikman hit Eric Bjornson
from 2 yards out for a touchdown with 8:44 to play. Gary Brown
gained 119 yards in 15 carries for New York.
 &UR; Dolphins 27, Colts 14 &QC; 
	   In Miami, Rookie John Avery rushed for 100 yards and O.J.
McDuffie caught two touchdown passes to spark an offense that has
sputtered for most of the season for the Dolphins (6-3).
	   Miami, averaging 269 yards per game, outgained Indianapolis
(1-8) 279-57 in the first half for a 20-0 lead. The Colts scored
all of their points in the final eight minutes.
	   Peyton Manning was held to 140 yards passing, completing 22 of
42 attempts with two interceptions and one touchdown. 
 &UR; Ravens 13, Raiders 10 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Rod Woodson returned an interception 18 yards for
a touchdown and Michael McCrary had four sacks as the Ravens
snapped a four-game losing streak.
	   After allowing 45 points in an embarrassing loss to Jacksonville
last week, the defense of the Ravens (3-6) redeemed itself. And
Marchibroda, in the final season of a three-year contract, received
at least a one-week reprieve from questions concerning his shaky
job situation.
	   The Raiders (6-3), who had won five straight, expected their
good fortune to continue with quarterback Jeff George back in the
lineup for the first time since October. But George reinjured his
groin and left after the first quarter.
 &UR; Eagles 10, Lions 9 &QC; 
	   In Philadelphia, less than six days after a humiliating 34-0
loss at home to Dallas, the Eagles beat Detroit, surviving when
Jason Hanson's 58-yard field goal attempt landed short with 31
seconds left.
	   Charlie Garner rushed for a career-high 129 yards for the Eagles
(2-7), who contained Barry Sanders until the final drive and added
a glimmer of respectability to their season.
	   Garner and Duce Staley (17 carries, 89 yards) shredded the
league's sixth-best run defense. Sanders rushed 20 times for 140
yards for the Lions (2-7), exceeding 1,000 yards for the NFL record
10th straight season.
 &UR; Rams 20, Bears 12 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Tony Banks completed 24 of 31 passes for 202 yards
and one touchdown and ran for another score for St. Louis.
	   Ricky Proehl, Chicago's leading receiver last year, caught eight
passes for 99 yards and a score for St. Louis, and Jeff Wilkins
kicked two field goals.
	   The victory broke a three-game losing streak for the Rams (3-6)
and was their first win in Chicago since Nov. 3, 1986. It was the
first loss in four years after a bye week for the Bears (3-6), who
had won two straight and three of their last four.
	   Just like they have all year, though, the Bears made it lively
at the end. A St. Louis safety cut the lead to 20-12 with 1:59
left, and later a 48-yard pass to Bobby Engram put the Bears at the
20. But they could move no more.

	    &UR; 49ers 25, Panthers 23 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Ty Detmer, subbing for the injured Steve
Young, led a drive to set up Wade Richey's 46-yard field goal with
33 seconds left, as the 49ers (7-2) overcame an early 16-0 deficit.
Young was out with a pulled abdominal muscle.
	   Detmer, making his first start since joining San Francisco as a
free agent, threw three interceptions in the first half and fumbled
once. But he came back to throw touchdown passes of 36 and 5 yards
to Terrell Owens and a 29-yarder to J.J. Stokes.
	   Steve Beuerlein, who was 25-of-41 for 265 yards, threw a 20-yard
touchdown pass to Raghib Ismail, Kasay kicked field goals of 50, 42
and 41 yards and former 49er William Floyd had a 2-yard touchdown
run that put Carolina (1-8) back on top after the Panthers blew
their big lead.
	    &UR; Broncos 27, Chargers 10 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Bubby Brister, who started after John Elway strained
rib muscles during pregame warmups, threw two touchdown passes as
Denver remained unbeaten in nine games.
	   Terrell Davis, the NFL's leading rusher, was held to 69 yards on
20 carries by a San Diego defense that ranked first in total
defense and rushing defense. Davis accounted for two touchdowns,
catching a 4-yard TD pass from Brister and running 24 yards for
another.
	   Brister completed 20 of 33 passes for 229 yards. San Diego's
Ryan Leaf completed only 4 of 15 passes for 26 yards with an
interception and a sack before being replaced by Craig Whelihan
early in the third quarter. The Chargers had generated just 49
total yards and two first downs to that point.
	    &UR; Cardinals 29, Redskins 27 &QC; 
	   In Tempe, Arizona, the Cardinals squandered a 9-point lead in
the final 1:39, then came back to beat Washington 29-27 Sunday on
Joe Nedney's 47-yard field goal with two seconds left.
	   Jake Plummer completed four passes for 50 yards in 29 seconds to
set up Nedney's winning kick. That came after Washington had scored
10 points in 56 seconds to overcome a 26-17 lead.
	   First Trent Green hit Leslie Shepard for a 35-yard touchdown to
cut it to 26-24. Then Stephen Davis recovered an onside kick to set
up Cary Blanchard's 54-yard field goal with 35 seconds left, giving
Washington a 27-26 lead.
	    &UR; Jets 34, Bills 12 &QC; 
	   In East Rutherford, New Jersey, Vinny Testaverde, in the midst
of the best streak of his 12-year career, passed for three
touchdowns in New York's 34-12 rout of the Buffalo Bills. The
victory, which snapped the Bills' six-game winning streak in the
series, left the Jets (6-3) tied with Miami for first place in the
AFC East.
	   New York won its fourth straight thanks to Testaverde's
marksmanship and a staunch defense that clamped down on the elusive
Doug Flutie.
	   Testaverde, the 1986 Heisman Trophy winner who is unbeaten in
six starts this year, threw for 258 yards, while Flutie (1984
Heisman) passed for only 154. He constantly was harassed by the
Jets defense and threw two interceptions that led to 10 points.
	    &UR; Seahawks 24, Chiefs 12 &QC; 
	   In Seattle, the Seahawks (5-4), losers of four of their previous
five, took advantage of four turnovers that made up for an offense
that gained only 202 yards.
	   It was Kansas City's fourth consecutive defeat, the first time
that has happened to the Chiefs since Schottenheimer took over as
coach of the franchise in 1989. The Chiefs (4-5) could miss the
playoffs for the third time in Schottenheimer's successful tenure
in Kansas City.
	   Seattle beat Kansas City for the first time since 1994 to end a
seven-game winning streak by Kansas City over the Seahawks. The
Chiefs had beaten them 14 out of 15.

Diplomacy and commerce converge in U.S. missile bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Greece's decision to buy U.S.-made Patriot
missiles capped a process as full of strategy as warfare itself,
with top U.S. officials combining forces with Raytheon Corp. to
lobby for the deal. The effort is the most recent example of a key
shift in U.S. diplomacy: a growing emphasis on American diplomats
helping chase big money.
	   ___
 &UR; By BRIAN MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ It could have been a billion-dollar
baklava.
	   ``Enjoy,'' a Greek-born production line worker at Raytheon Corp.
said in her native tongue. Greece's defense minister, Akis
Tzochatzopoulos, took the honey-drenched sweets baked by the
employee's mother. He smiled broadly.
	   So did Raytheon executives and the U.S. ambassador to Greece,
Nicholas Burns. The July 10 trip to the Boston-area plant was going
well. The greeting from about two dozen Greek-American employees
was part of an elaborate tour and briefing by Raytheon, which was
locked in an all-or-nothing fight for the contract to upgrade
Greece's air defenses.
	   It was Raytheon's Patriot anti-aircraft missile vs. Russia's
S-300. Greece had more than dlrs 1 billion to spend.
	   Burns felt the visit to the Andover, Massachusetts, plant
boosted Raytheon into the lead _ for the moment at least.
	   ___
	   It's gold rush time in the Aegean region for arms makers.
	   Greece has pledged to spend dlrs 17 billion by 2001 to beef up
its military. It also anticipates spending dlrs 7 billion more in a
second phase.
	   The buying spree is designed to keep pace with neighboring
Turkey, which says it will spend dlrs 150 billion over the next 30
years to upgrade its own military.
	   For Russia, it was a prime chance to win prestige for the S-300
anti-aircraft missile and inject some very needed money into its
Soviet-era weapons industry.
	   Raytheon was just as hungry. Defense budgets in many parts of
the world are shrinking. Places like Greece and Turkey are now key
arenas in the international competition for arms sales.
	   Enter the diplomatic corps.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Athens and Raytheon's leaders forged an
unusually close partnership. One Raytheon executive, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said they ``were joined at the hip.''
	   ``Getting this contract was a number one priority for us,''
Burns said.
	   Such teamwork is part of a fundamental reshaping of the role of
top American diplomats, foreign affairs experts say.
	   Traditionally, many trade and business issues were left to
commercial attaches at U.S. embassies _ who rarely had the clout to
lobby directly with prime ministers and presidents. In the 1990s,
however, American ambassadors are increasingly being used as a
potent sales force.
	   ``Bringing in ambassadors can really raise the temperature in
terms of plugging American companies,'' said Gordon Adams, deputy
director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in
London.
	   Other countries, particularly France and Britain, have long
engaged their top diplomats in promoting national companies. But
America once had a comfortable dominance in defense and consumer
goods, and didn't need to worry about such things.
	   That margin began to shrink when companies like the European
plane maker Airbus Industrie and state arms makers became tough
competitors for international sales. Russia is also aggressively
marketing its military wares around the world.
	   The Clinton administration has taken full notice. It has
significantly boosted demands that its diplomatic envoys _ and
especially ambassadors _ press for business deals.
	   ``But don't forget, this can skew things,'' said Robert
Hutchings, a former U.S. ambassador-at-large for eastern Europe.
	   Washington, he suggested, could start paying more attention to
countries with money to spend than to politically strategic
regions.
	   ``There is always the danger of the commercial tail wagging the
strategic dog,'' Hutchings said.
	   ___
	   The dlrs 1.2 billion Patriot deal with Greece, announced Oct. 9,
was one of the landmark victories for America's commercial
diplomacy initiatives.
	   The price tag was smaller than some of the biggest foreign deals
of the decade _ the dlrs 6 billion deal in 1995 with Saudi Arabia
for Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas planes or the dlrs 7 billion
order of Lockheed Martin Corp.'s F-16 fighter-bombers by the United
Arab Emirates this year.
	   But the competition with Russia was extraordinarily tight.
	   Burns, a former State Department spokesman, was in almost daily
contact with Raytheon plotting the U.S. pitch, according to
accounts of the bid process given by embassy and company sources.
	   There was tradition on Raytheon's side. The United States has
been Greece's main arms supplier for 50 years.
	   But Russia was bent on securing a NATO customer for its S-300s,
which have been purchased by China, India, Slovakia, Ukraine and
the ethnic Greek portion of Cyprus _ the latter an important
consideration for Greek military chiefs because of a defense pact
with Greek Cypriots.
	   The Patriot is deployed in the United States and seven other
countries, including Israel and Kuwait.
	   NATO brass were also watching Greece's defense shopping. They
worried about the precedent of an alliance member going outside to
buy a major weapons system.

ATHENS: weapons system.

<TEXT>
	   ``It would have been a very bad symbol,'' Burns said.
	   Washington quickly stepped in.
	   In January, Commerce Secretary William Daley became the first
U.S. Cabinet official to visit Greece in nearly a decade. Three
months later, Defense Secretary William Cohen stopped in Athens and
invited his Greek counterpart to come to the United States.
	   Tzochatzopoulos was treated like royalty at companies hoping to
do business with Greece: warplane makers Lockheed Martin and
McDonnell Douglas, in addition to Raytheon.
	   In Boston, Burns arranged for Tzochatzopoulos to meet former
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis, who is of Greek descent.
Burns and Tzochatzopoulos later listened to Irish music at a
waterfront pub until closing time.
	   The next day at Raytheon, Greek flags were stenciled on
olive-drab Patriot launchers. The company's campus-like grounds
also were carefully scrubbed, in hopes a gleaming site would
contrast to the image of Russia's cash-strapped state industries.
	   Tzochatzopoulos was given a specially tailored two-hour
presentation explaining deployment options in Greece. The
screen-savers on the Raytheon computers were even reprogrammed to
scroll a welcome message to the Greek delegation.
	   Golf carts took the entourage on a tour of the plant.
Tzochatzopoulos peppered the Raytheon staff with questions.
	   ``He clearly was still doing comparative shopping,'' said Burns.
	   After Tzochatzopoulos returned to Athens, the Russians made
their big move. They slashed the price for the S-300 package by
dlrs 200 million.
	   ``We were scared,'' said Burns. ``We really thought we could
lose this sale.''
	   Raytheon couldn't match the price. So the strategy changed. They
raised questions about Russia's ability to handle long-term
contracts. They pressed the questions harder as the financial
meltdown in Russia worsened.
	   ``And we again called Washington for help,'' said Burns.
	   It came in the form of calls and letters from Daley, Cohen and
Secretary of State Madeline Albright. A few days before Greece's
decision, Burns called Premier Costas Simitis to make a final
appeal.
	   At the same time, Russian's defense minister, Marshal Igor
Sergeyev, was in Athens to lobby for the S-300. At a major defense
industry trade show, Sergeyev posed with Tzochatzopoulos in front
of a model of the Russian missile.
	   Raytheon representatives _ in the adjacent display booth _
looked on uncomfortably.
	   ``We had no idea which way the Greeks would go,'' Burns said.
``It was a total secret.''
	   ___
	   Burns was in his office when Tzochatzopoulos called Oct. 9. The
Greeks would announce the Patriot contract in a few minutes, Burns
was told. And he learned Raytheon also won a dlrs 200 million
contract for 45 T-6A training planes.
	   ``We got it!'' he yelled to his staff.
	   Others involved in the Patriot project gathered in Burns'
office, decorated with memorabilia from his hometown of Boston and
its baseball team, the Red Sox. They raised mugs of coffee and
glasses of mineral water in celebration.
	   Burns put off the champagne toast. He plans to hold a reception
at his residence for Raytheon and Greek officials when the contract
is formally signed, possibly early in the coming year.
	   Russia got a smaller piece from Greece: a contract for 21 Tor-M1
short-range missiles. But it marked the first order for the rockets
by a NATO country.
	   The next big Greek contracts are expected to be announced later
this year _ an estimated dlrs 3.5 billion for fighter jets and
surveillance aircraft. The United States is pushing its F-15 and
F-16 warplanes, Northrop Grumman Corp.'s E-2C Hawkeye 2000 airborne
radar plane and Lockheed's C-130J transport.
	   Also in the running are France's Mirage 2000, Russia's Su-27 and
the Eurofighter, a joint project of four European nations.

As trail enters second week, Anwar sharply criticizes Mahathir
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ As Anwar Ibrahim's trial entered
its second week, the ousted deputy prime minister accused Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad in an interview published Monday of being
``drunk with power.''
	   ``It's a tragedy that he is unable to see that absolute power
corrupts absolutely!'' Anwar told Time magazine. ``In his desperate
attempt to cling to power, he has no qualms about using all
instruments of government to serve his ends.''
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, about two weeks after he was fired
by Mahathir, setting off many anti-government protests.
	   In the interview, he said he has lost six kilograms (13 pounds)
in jail, but keeps up a regimen of jogging to keep fit and reading
voraciously.
	   ``Busy with prayers, devouring books, strategizing `reformsi,'
avoiding the indolence of prison life,'' Anwar said. Reformasi, the
term he uses for his campaign of political reforms, has become the
rally cry of the protesters in Malaysia.
	   Anwar, who is on trial on charges of corruption and sexual
misconduct, gave written answers from jail in response to questions
sent to him, Time said.
	   In the opening week of the trial, former police intelligence
chief Mohamed Said Awang startled the court by testifying that
police had coerced statements from arrested people and forced some
of them to retract allegations they first made.
	   Anwar denies the 10 charges of corruption and illegal sex acts
against him, saying they were fabricated because Mahathir
considered Anwar's popularity a threat to the prime minister's
17-year rule.
	   ``In his desperate attempt to cling to power, he has no qualms
about using all instruments of state to serve his ends,'' Anwar
said in the interview. ``My perception of his leadership is that he
is drunk with power and he has lost all sense of rationality and
sanity.''
	   Mahathir will be ``remembered as one who spurred economic
development and brought prosperity to the country, only to
eventually destroy it because of his megalomania,'' Anwar said.
``He has condoned abuse of power, corruption, cronyism and
nepotism.''

	   YPRES, Belgium (AP) _ Hunched against an autumn drizzle, the
mason bends towards a weathered white tombstone and applies a fine
jet of compressed air to words made faint by decades of exposure to
the chill winds of Flanders Fields.
	   Soon the stark inscription reads clearly again: ``Private C.B.
Laugher, 5th Bn. Australian Infantry, 24th, September, 1916, age
19.''
	   The grave done, the mason picks up his tools and moves to the
next in seemingly endless rows of headstones.
	   Pvt. Laugher was one among the 200,000 British and Commonwealth
soldiers whose deaths in World War I are recorded on graves and
monuments around Ypres.
	   ``Every year, during the whole year, we do nothing but this,''
says Ivan Vermote, one of 24 stonemasons who work out of Ypres for
the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.
	   Ypres will be the focus of ceremonies Wednesday marking the 80th
anniversary of the armistice that ended The Great War on Nov. 11,
1918.
	   Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and Belgium's King Albert II will
attend the remembrance service along with a handful of surviving
veterans.
	   The monarchs will stand under the giant Menin Gate that is
carved with the names of 54,000 Commonwealth soldiers whose bodies
were never recovered from the Flanders mud. Local buglers will play
``Taps'' as they have every day for decades.
	   In a ceremony packed with symbolism, Queen Elizabeth will also
join Irish President Mary McAleese in the nearby town of Mesen to
remember 50,000 Irishmen who fell in the war.
	   The monument they will unveil to Roman Catholic and Protestant
Irish who died fighting shoulder-to-shoulder is meant as a symbol
for modern-day reconciliation after this year's peace agreement for
Northern Ireland.
	   From 1914 to 1918, British and allied troops fought a war of
attrition against the Germans in the trenches around Ypres. They
prevented the Kaiser's armies capturing English Channel ports, but
paid a terrible cost.
	   Today in the flat, featureless landscape, it seems every twist
in the road reveals another cemetery, with its tight ranks of young
men's graves.
	   There is a German cemetery at nearby Langemarck where 44,000 lie
beneath slabs of dark gray stone. There are monuments to fallen
Belgian and French soldiers and to American ``doughboys'' who died
in the final months of the war.
	   But it is the British dead who most haunt this town where the
carnage prompted Winston Churchill to say ``a more sacred place for
the British race does not exist in the world.''
	   Despite the passing of time, the 137 British cemeteries in
Flanders are meticulously maintained by a team of 190
administrators, gardeners and stonemasons working for the Ypres
office of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.
	   Fewer family members come to mourn the dead these days. They are
replaced by a growing number of students and tourists.
	   ``It's becoming more historical rather than emotional. Most of
the people who fought in the war are long gone,'' says Jim Cooke,
works supervisor of the commission.
	   However, he adds, ``I've witnessed youngsters of 14 and 15 break
down in tears ... it comes as a shock for the first time when you
stand in the cemetery and see the enormity of it all.''
	   The mud of Flanders still yields a grim harvest of bodies from
the war. Four or five are uncovered every year.

Amid poverty, Azerbaijanis still hoping for oil wealth
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Yazgul Khalil looks out on the
glistening Caspian Sea and shares her dream of a day when the vast
lake of oil lying under the seabed will bring prosperity to
Azerbaijan.
	   ``I believe I will see that beautiful time,'' Ms. Khalil said,
her austere face relaxing momentarily in a smile.
	   The former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan is sitting over an
estimated 2 billion tons (14 billion barrels) of oil. But
development has been slow, and the absence of a major export
pipeline has keep most of the country's 7.5 million people in
poverty. Jobs are scarce and monthly salaries rarely exceed 170,000
manat (dlrs 43).
	   ``The oil industry has provided hope for the future, and all the
people who come here to work for that industry obviously enjoy a
high standard of living,'' said Thomas Barry, head of the Baku
mission of the National Democratic Institute, a private U.S.
educational group.
	   ``But it's not like in the last couple of years there has been a
huge flow of money from the sale of oil.''
	   Marble and glass office buildings have sprung up along
cobblestone streets in the old part of the city. Billboards around
town advertise German cars, American cigarettes and Czech beer. But
for many Azerbaijanis, an extra loaf of flat bread is a splurge.
	   Ms. Khalil, a 55-year-old retired engineer who receives a
monthly pension of 78,000 manat (dlrs 20), blames President Geidar
Aliev's government for the hard times. She says he has failed to
produce the oil wealth, restart the idle factories, and end rampant
corruption.
	   ``The elite live well. But not us,'' she says.
	   Aliev, the former Communist Party leader of Soviet Azerbaijan
and KGB general who retook power in a bloodless 1993 coup, has
earned many critics abroad for stifling dissent, censoring news
media and enforcing a blockade on archrival Armenia. In fact,
Azerbaijan is the only former Soviet republic not getting at least
some U.S. aid.
	   Aliev ``is an ex-KGB man; he knows how to keep tight controls,''
unemployed metalworker Nasim Isayev said with bitterness as he
watched police lines forming around a small opposition rally in
central Baku.
	   Azerbaijan's state oil company _ headed by Aliev's son Natik _
wants to start pumping crude in April along a pipeline that leads
to a Black Sea port in neighboring Georgia. But a major pipeline,
which could handle large quantities of oil, is still expected to
take years to build.
	   And with world oil prices sagging, this nation has yet to see
the windfall that Aliev has been predicting for years.
	   Aliev easily won re-election in October, though the ballot was
boycotted by the opposition and called undemocratic by foreign
observers.
	   Still, Aliev's carefully cultivated image of a strict
grandfather has earned him admirers even among the poor.
	   ``He is a unique person. He can do anything,'' said Taptyk
Kummatov, who was selling sunflower seeds from a cardboard tray in
front of a subway entrance.
	   And despite the holes in his pants, and the fraying edges of his
shirt, Kummatov proclaims: ``My life is just great now.''
	   Then, he hurried off to continue his rounds under the blazing
sun.

	   TSUKUBA, Japan (AP) _ It is just after feeding time, and two
calves are contentedly drinking water from a trough in their
nondescript pen, a few stray pieces of hay stuck to their wet,
brown noses.
	   The two 4-month-olds _ ES1 and ES2 _ are the prototypes of a
brave new world of cloning that Japanese researchers, farmers and
entrepreneurs are rapidly taking out of the laboratory and putting
onto the dinner table.
	   Cloned potatoes, tomatoes and asparagus are already commonplace
in Japanese grocery stores. Cloned orchids are sold by florists,
and cloned goldfish are available at pet shops. Cloned flounder and
salmon are in the works.
	   But with the domestic cattle industry being squeezed by cheaper
imported beef, Japanese scientists and agricultural officials see
the real goal of cloning to be the widespread genetic copying of
mammals.
	   ``Our primary interest is to revive Japan's cattle industry,''
said Makoto Tabata, who is in charge of cloning research for the
Ministry of Agriculture.
	   Cloning, it is hoped, will spawn a breed of supercattle and
reliable source of high-quality beef that can be produced at lower
cost.
	   Japan's strides in cloning have generally been heralded in the
media and welcomed by the public, with little of the angst and
debate over ethics and safety that has been seen in the United
States and elsewhere.
	   Tabata said Japan is probably the only country in the world
where state-of-the-art cloning techniques are already being
performed widely in rural breeding centers.
	   Robert Foote, professor of animal science at Cornell University,
cautioned that the government's claims of being ahead are sometimes
more perceived than real. He said the overall level of research is
similar in Japan and the United States.
	   But Foote agreed that one difference in Japan is the
government's involvement in allocating funds, compared with a
stronger tendency for private financing in the United States.
	   Along with dozens of self-funded projects, more than 30 public
and private livestock centers received a total of 300 million yen
(dlrs 2.2 million) from the ministry for cattle cloning research
this year. A significant increase in government grants is expected
next year.
	   Cloning techniques vary from simple plant cuttings _ a method
that has been used by farmers and gardeners for centuries _ to the
extremely delicate and still unreliable replication of adult
mammals from their genetic material.
	   Even so, nearly 400 cows cloned from fertilized eggs have hit
the market as beef or breeders. Since early July, 15 calves have
been born using the same technique used for Dolly, the Scottish
sheep that made history as the world's first adult-animal clone.
Nine have survived.
	   ES1 and ES2 are the products of a more primitive technique in
which an embryo's cell is inserted into an egg whose nucleus has
been removed. After the two are fused by an electric shock, the egg
is put into the womb of a surrogate cow and carried to term.
	   The ES stands for embryonic stem cell, the kind of cell from
which the calves were cloned.
	   ``What we are trying to do here is to help cattle farmers
increase the number of superior cows,'' said Yoshito Aoyagi, chief
scientist at the government's cloning research institute in
Tsukuba, just north of Tokyo.
	   There are dissenters.
	   ``Escalating research, fading ethics,'' the Asahi, a major
newspaper, said in a recent editorial. ``Because the technology can
be used to produce human clones, there is an urgent need for a
social consensus for such an advanced reproductive technology.''
	   To cover all bases, the Science and Technology Agency appointed
a 16-member panel last January to ponder the ethics of cloning.
Last year, the Education Ministry followed the United States' lead
by freezing funds on human cloning research.
	   But market forces continue to be the overriding concern.
	   Imported beef, banned in Japan until 1995, now accounts for more
than 50 percent of the domestic market.
	   In 1997, Japan produced 554,968 tons of beef, and imported
629,641 tons from the United States, New Zealand, Australia and
Europe, according to the Japan External Trade Organization.
	   Agriculture ministry officials are afraid that keeping up with
imports under present conditions may well be impossible.
	   The majority of Japanese livestock farms are family operated,
with the owners' aged 60 or more. Space is severely limited and the
dropout rate growing _ the number of cattle farms with more than
three cows plummeted 20 percent to 113,000 in 1996 from 1993.
	   ``We have to find ways to reduce costs to compete with foreign
beef,'' said Masanori Oka, an official in charge of promoting
cattle production in the rural southern prefecture of Oita, one of
Japan's cattle-raising centers.
	   ``If we can establish the technology, we can make a lot of
clones and boost our supply of high-quality beef at a low cost,''
he said.

	   Some cloning products on sale in Japan or expected out soon, and
background on why cloning seen as attractive:
	   ___
	   CLONES ON SALE: Most domestically grown potatoes, sweet
potatoes, tomatoes, asparagus, rice, strawberries and melons.
Expensive flowers such as chrysanthemums and orchids also commonly
cloned, as are goldfish.
	   ___
	   CLONES IN WORKS: Cloned flounder created by scientists in
northwest Japan nearly ready for market. Fishery researchers also
trying to clone sea bream, salmon and trout to boost local
economies.
	   ___
	   WHY CLONING PROFITABLE: By cloning superior traits, farmers can
boost production and cut costs of high-quality livestock,
vegetables, fruits, fish. Cloning also makes it easier to handle
vegetables because they are more likely to be same size, shape,
weight.
	   ___
	   HOW IT'S DONE: Many vegetable clones are made from tissue
removed from a plant, then grown independently in test tubes.

Washington: An exhausting but exciting posting for a diplomat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos WX112, WX113 &QL; 
 &UR; By DONNA ABU-NASR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ It was to have been one of Austrian Ambassador
Helmut Tuerk's quieter days: a staff meeting in the morning, a
conference call with the State Department at noon, a travel
interview with an Arkansas newspaper in the afternoon.
	   But a phone call at 6 a.m. on Oct. 23 turned Tuerk's schedule
upside down and the ambassador found himself a front-row witness to
the signing of the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement at the White
House.
	   Close to midnight, as he stood next to his wife Monika greeting
guests at a reception, Tuerk summed up his 18-hour day as ``one of
the most interesting'' of his almost six-year tenure in Washington.
	   ``Such an agreement does not take place every day,'' said Tuerk.
	    &UR; ___
	   For most diplomats, Washington is a prize posting. The United
States is not only the only remaining superpower but also a major
commercial hub that represents a vast market for their countries'
products.
	   There are more than 170 diplomatic missions in Washington,
representing countries from populous China to tiny Luxembourg, from
allies or those with whom relations are strained. Countries like
Cuba and Iraq, which don't have diplomatic relations with the
United States, have interest sections housed in other embassies.
	   Ambassadors are the personal representatives of their country's
head of state. They carry out negotiations dealing with the
political, economic and cultural relations between the two
countries, and also promote trade and help visiting businessmen
find markets for their products.
	    &UR; ___
	   Since Tuerk arrived in Washington in January 1993, he has made
an effort to introduce Austria to the rest of America. He has spent
70 days traveling around the country this year. He is also the
first Austrian ambassador to officially visit all 50 states and the
first ambassador ever to visit all five territories.
	   ``From the very beginning I said I'm not the Austrian ambassador
to Washington but to the United States of America,'' said Tuerk,
57, who also has served in Hong Kong and Germany. ``I saw my task
as showing the Austrian flag all over this country.''
	   Tuerk said the one thing that distinguishes his current posting
from his two earlier ones is that Washington is ``the top
diplomatic post, particularly in view of the position of the United
States as the sole superpower.''
	   For the past four months, Tuerk has also represented the
European Union and presided over EU-related meetings and functions
in Washington because Austria holds the current presidency of the
15-member body. That's why he was the only European ambassador,
other than Norway's, to get the White House invitation.
	    &UR; ___
	   In an average week, Tuerk attends 10 meetings and eight
receptions, dinners and luncheons. The tall, slim bespectacled
diplomat keeps fit by having light lunches _ bananas and yogurt.
	   Tuerk said he has had no problems adjusting to life in America
because he was here as a high school exchange student in Union
City, Pennsylvania, where he got his high school degree in 1958.
	   Tuerk laughed when asked why he chose to become a diplomat,
paraphrasing John F. Kennedy: ``Don't ask what your country can do
for you but what you can do for your country.''
	    &UR; ___
	   Tuerk's day began with a 6 a.m. phone call from the foreign
ministry in Vienna. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was supposed
to fly to Austria to brief the European Union presidency on the
Middle East peace agreement, and the foreign ministry wanted to
coordinate schedules. A 2 p.m. takeoff was set.
	   Tuerk put in his weekly call to the State Department's Bureau of
European and Canadian Affairs at 9:30. He and the State Department
official on the line discussed upcoming events, including
December's EU-U.S. summit in Washington. Tuerk informed the
official of Arafat's travel plans and promised to update him on the
Palestinian leader's Austria visit.
	   The ambassador then chaired the embassy's daily staff meeting,
waiting meanwhile for a call from the White House about the status
of the signing ceremony for the accord.
	   Economic attache Stefan Scholz talked about a meeting at the
State Department on humanitarian aid to Kosovo. Teresa Indjein, the
cultural attache, discussed an upcoming European film festival.
	   And Martin Eichtinger, the information attache, updated the
others on an embassy Internet quiz that ends Dec. 31: What's the
name of the new European currency? There were 84 correct answers
out of 108 entries: the euro. The winner gets a round-trip ticket
to Austria.

WASHINGTON: to Austria.

<TEXT>
	   The embassy has 42 staffers, 32 of them from Austria. The legal
staff takes care, among other things, of making sure the more than
12,000 Jewish Austrians who fled during World War II and now live
in the United States get their pensions.
	   The cultural staff puts on exhibits, concerts, film festivals
and lectures. More than 30,000 people attended such functions last
year. The information section produces two newsletters and updates
the embassy's Internet site and a new site created for EU-related
news.
	   The ambassador has put a big emphasis on forming close ties with
Congress and the Clinton administration.
	   Does he have easy access to the officials? ``Yes and no.
Everybody is very busy. I understand that they cannot devote time
to a foreign diplomat if there's nothing really important to
discuss.''
	   He does most of his business over the phone.
	    &UR; ___
	   At noon, Tuerk was still waiting for a call from the White
House. The ambassador forwarded his phones to the conference room
where there was a champagne toast for three staffers, a couple who
recently married, and a third who also got married.
	   As he was munching on a cheese sandwich, Tuerk got a call from
the PLO office to say Arafat was still at the talks. Vienna called
to ask about the status of the negotiations.
	   Finally, at 2:30 p.m., a television report said the agreement
would be signed later that afternoon. Tuerk's secretary called up
the State Department for details. They had none.
	   Fifteen minutes later, Tuerk canceled the interview with the
Arkansas newspaper and left for a downtown hotel to join Miguel
Moratinos, the European Union's Middle East envoy who was also
attending the ceremony. The two men went together to the White
House.
	    &UR; ___
	   After watching Arafat's plane take off at 7:10 p.m., Tuerk
headed to Georgetown University for the opening concert of the 17th
season of the Schubert, Schubert and Schubert festival. The concert
featuring works by the Austrian composer had been scheduled long
before the Middle East talks and the embassy was one of its
sponsors.
	   At 10:30 p.m., Tuerk and his wife went home to receive their
guests from the festival _ artists, society ladies, members of
various international organizations and Leon Fuerth, foreign policy
adviser to Vice President Al Gore.
	   Would he describe a diplomats' life as all glitz and glamour?
	   ``Times have changed,'' said Tuerk. ``The pace has really
accelerated. It's much more hectic and much more serious work is
demanded.''
	   And how can he keep smiling after such a long day?
	   ``Most diplomats are trained to keep smiling even if they don't
want to smile,'' said Tuerk. ``And if someone cannot keep smiling
perhaps he might not be so well suited to be a diplomat.''

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ While Austrian Ambassador Helmut Tuerk was at
the White House witnessing the signing of a new Middle East accord,
his wife, Monika, was attending a fashion show at the residence of
her neighbor, Bryndis Schram, wife of the Icelandic ambassador.
	   Mrs. Tuerk, who gave up a career as a lawyer when her husband
was posted to Washington, says attending fashion shows and other
functions and supporting charitable organizations are just as
important to her as working outside the house.
	   ``It's my way of joining my husband in representing our
country,'' she said.
	   An ambassador's wife can choose to keep a low profile or be an
active lobbyist for her country. Many favor the latter option.
	   They do so by joining various charities, introducing visiting
dignitaries to the host country by showing them the sights and
promoting their country's traditions, culture and art through
lectures, soirees and bazaars.
	   And in an emergency, an ambassador's wife is the one many turn
to. When a former Austrian foreign minister lost the button on his
jacket just as he was going into a reception, Mrs. Tuerk was the
one who sewed it on.
	   ``An ambassador and his spouse are only successful if they make
a good team,'' said Mrs. Tuerk.
	   Mrs. Schram's fashion show was intended to showcase works by
Icelandic designer Maria Lovisa. In the next few months, she plans
to invite Icelandic artists for cultural events at the residence to
promote her tiny island country.
	   ``I have this craving to do something even though as the wife of
an ambassador you're not expected to do anything,'' said Mrs.
Schram, whose husband, Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson, is a former
foreign minister. ``It's the best way to introduce your culture.''

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Supermodel Kate Moss has checked into a London
clinic under an assumed name and is being treated for exhaustion,
The Mirror newspaper reported.
	   ``I've been doing a lot of hard work and too much partying,''
the paper quoted Ms. Moss, 24, as saying. She checked into The
Priory, an expensive private psychiatric clinic in Roehampton,
southwest London, last week.
	   ``I wasn't happy with the way my life was going and so I decided
to take a step back and assess my life and future,'' she said. ``I
want to be totally responsible for myself. And this is the place
where I can get the peace and quiet to start the process.''
	   The Mirror on Saturday quoted an unidentified source as saying
that London-born Ms. Moss has had a ``mini-collapse'' and is
expected to be out of the clinic ``next week or so.''
	   As a teen-ager, Moss led the fashion world's so-called ``waif
look'' that some critics dubbed ``heroin chic.'' She has denied
ever taking heroin.

during a polo match didn't hurt as much as the press coverage he
got.
	   Before the extent of his injuries _ which proved to be only
bumps and bruises _ were known, some reports made the Oct. 30
accident sound more frightening that it proved to be.
	   ``The only thing that's scary is the way the media
sensationalized and exaggerated and flat lied about it in order to
increase their ratings,'' Jones says in Sunday's (Harlingen) Valley
Morning Star. ``I feel insulted by having been exploited by the
media.''
	   Jones, who was thrown from his horse and stepped on, was taken
by helicopter to Houston, where doctors determined his injuries
weren't serious. The Oscar-winning actor said that type of accident
``happens to polo players all the time.''

Stung by case against brother, Salinas defends his administration
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Admitting it may sound ``implausible,'' former
Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari says he knew nothing of
the dealings of his older brother Raul, accused of murder and
laundering drug money.
	   ``With the benefit of hindsight, I of course wish I had known. I
would have acted, if necessary, to ensure there was no
impropriety,'' Salinas writes in an essay for Newsweek's
international edition, which goes on sale Monday.
	   A few months after Salinas left office in 1994, his brother was
charged with masterminding the assassination of a political rival.
He is now in a maximum-security prison near Mexico City.
	   Raul Salinas has also been charged with illicit enrichment, and
Swiss prosecutors last month ordered the seizure of dlrs 114
million dollars in offshore accounts, saying they are the illegal
profits of protection payments made by Mexican and Colombian drug
lords.
	   Many Mexicans are skeptical that the former president knew
nothing of his brother's affairs.
	   While Salinas was still in office, respected newsweekly Proceso
published several articles detailing alleged acts of corruption by
``the uncomfortable brother,'' a term still used by the Mexican
press.
	   Carlos Salinas has not been charged with any crime. He is
believed to be living in self-imposed exile in Ireland.
	   In the article, Salinas says he hasn't heard his brother's side
of the story because of strict security at the Almoloya de Juarez
prison.
	   ``His ability to communicate with his lawyers, with me or with
any other member of our family is limited,'' Carlos Salinas writes.
``Under these circumstances, I cannot confront him, either directly
or indirectly, or demand from him an explanation.''
	   The former president also blasts the Mexican Attorney General's
Office handling of the case _ even planting a corpse in land
belonging to Raul and claiming it was the body of a co-conspirator.
	   The Attorney General's Office in Mexico City had no comment
Sunday.
	   Carlos Salinas did not offer an explanation regarding his
brother's bank deposits in Switzerland _ which Raul Salinas
deposited under false names using passports issued by the Mexican
government while his brother was president.
	   Both brothers contend Swiss authorities used questionable

the money was an investment fund pooled by wealthy friends.
	   ``I do not have an explanation for the simple reason that I was
never aware of the fund's existence,'' Salinas writes. Reports of
the fund ``came to me as a complete surprise.
	   ``I know this strikes many as implausible,'' he says.
	   Swiss federal prosecutor Carla del Ponte said ``the business
dealings he claims are beyond all economic logic.''
	   Valentin Roschacher, the chief of Switzerland's antinarcotics
police, said investigators concluded that Colombia's Medellin and
Cali drug cartels as well as Mexican traffickers paid Raul Salinas
at least dlrs 500 million over 10 years to protect drug shipments
through Mexico.
	   Lawyers for Raul Salinas have appealed the Swiss decision to
confiscate the deposits to Switzerland's supreme court.

Dollar higher, Japanese stocks mixed at midday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was higher against the yen Monday
on concerns the United States may attack Iraq. Japanese stocks
turned mixed.
	   The dollar bought 119.28 yen at midday, up 1.28 yen from late
Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 119.10 yen
late Friday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 70.83
points, or 0.50 percent, ending the morning session at 14,192.80
points. On Friday, the average closed down 218.40 points, or 1.53
percent.
	   Traders said the dollar strengthened at the beginning of
Monday's trading amid speculation the United States may use force
to try to reopen Iraqi weapons sites to U.N. Inspectors. The U.S.
currency, considered a financial safe haven, often strengthens in
times of crisis.
	   On Sunday, President Bill Clinton directed his senior advisers
to weigh military and diplomatic strategies for a few more days.
Iraqi ministers said they would not back away from their decision
to bar U.N. inspections unless crippling economic sanctions were
lifted.
	   Fifteen U.N. weapons inspectors left Baghdad Saturday as the
United Nations began to reduce its presence in Iraq.
	   Traders were also awaiting possible remarks by Japanese
officials regarding the outline of a ruling Liberal Democratic
Party economic stimulus package expected later this week.
	   Share prices started higher Monday on hopes for more stimulus
measures, fueled by a Kyodo News agency report that Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi pledged in talks with former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone on Saturday that he would study a proposal to cut the
consumption tax to 3 percent from the current 5 percent.
	   The April 1997 consumption tax increase is considered one of the
major causes of Japan's recession.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 2.28 points, or 0.21 percent, to 1,087.19
points. The TOPIX closed down 15.10 points, or 1.37 percent, on
Friday.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond slipped to 0.830 percent from Friday's finish of 0.835
percent, driving its price up to 109.62 yen, up from 108.58 yen.

Poll: Most Britons want the queen to remain the monarch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP)_ Most Britons do not think Queen Elizabeth II should
abdicate the thrown to allow her oldest son, Prince Charles, to
become king, according to two polls released Monday.
	   A MORI poll commissioned for the tabloid the Daily Mail and GMTV
channel found that 67 percent believe the queen should remain the
monarch for the rest of her life, the paper said.
	   The poll also found that Britain is more supportive of the
relationship between the prince and his longtime love Camilla
Parker Bowles. Only 10 percent said they should split up, the
newspaper said.
	   ''The good news for Charles and Camilla is the highest-ever
level of support for them to conduct their relationship in public _
and eventually to marry,'' the Daily Mail said.
	   But the tabloid also reported that eight of ten Britons do not
want Mrs. Parker Bowles to become queen.
	   The prince, who celebrates his 50th birthday on Saturday, has
enjoyed increased popularity in the year after Princess Diana's
fatal car crash in Paris.
	   But the latest polls come after he has been at the center of
some controversy. A television documentary that aired Sunday quoted
an unnamed ''senior royal aide'' as claiming that Prince Charles
would be ''privately delighted'' if his mother, 72, abdicated.
	   The prince issued a strong denial on Friday, following publicity
about the London Weekend Television program. The producers have
said they stand by their report.
	   And two weeks ago, Prince Charles and Mrs. Parker Bowles were
forced to issue a joint statement that they were not involved ``in
any way'' in a new book that criticizes Princess Diana and purports
to be based on interviews with his friends, family and aides.
	   The MORI poll was based on interviews with 1,019 adults between
Nov. 5-6. The newspaper did not give a margin of error.
	   Meanwhile, another poll published Monday by The Daily Telegraph
mirrored these results. It found that 66 percent of Britons were
against the idea of the queen abdicating. That poll was based on
interviews with 1,036 people.

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Experienced test prop Dan Crowley on
Monday became the seventh player to be ruled out of Australia's
rugby union tour of France and England because of injury.
	   Cameron Blades was named to replace Crowley, who will miss the
tour due to an ankle injury suffered at training last week.
	   Blades joins his brother and fellow prop Andrew in the 26-man
Wallaby touring squad which leaves Wednesday to play a warmup match
against France A then test matches against France and England.
	   Crowley has played in 10 of the 11 Australian test matches this
year.
	   The squad is already without injured players Tim Horan, Matt
Burke, Ben Tune, Richard Harry, Damian Smith and Stirling Mortlock.

	   In Calgary, Alberta, rookie goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere
sparkled in his Calgary debut, making 39 saves to lead the Flames
over the Colorado Avalanche.
	   After Calgary took a 2-1 lead in the game's 13th minute, the
21-year-old Giguere took over the game. He was especially strong in
the second period when the Avalanche outshot Calgary 20-3 but
failed to score.
	   Theoren Fleury, Jeff Shantz and Jarome Iginla scored for
Calgary. Chris Drury scored the only goal for the Avalanche, who
are off to a 4-8-1 start and have yet to record consecutive

	   The win was Calgary's first of the season at home after an 0-3-2
start.

Pinochet to fight extradition ''with all my spirit''
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Hearing begins at 1100 GMT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, immune
from prosecution in his home country, says fellow Chileans are his
true judges and that he will strenuously fight prosecutors' efforts
to extradite him to Spain on mass murder charges.
	   The general's first public statement since his arrest in London
last month came ahead of Monday's resumption of an appeal to decide
Gen. Pinochet's fate before Britain's highest court, a panel of
senior judges from Parliament's House of Lords.
	   ``A show trial in a foreign land is not justice,'' Pinochet said
in a four-page statement published in newspapers Sunday. ``My
fellow citizens have come to terms with our nation's past. They are
my true judges.''
	   ``That is why I shall fight this extradition request with all my
spirit,'' the statement said.
	   Prosecutors are arguing that the genocide, mass murder and
torture charges against the former dictator should overrule
Britain's immunity for former heads of state.
	   But Pinochet's lawyers were expected to ask the five-judge panel
Monday to uphold the Oct. 28 High Court ruling that declared
Pinochet's arrest in Britain illegal.
	   British police arrested Pinochet, 82, on Oct. 16 in his hospital
bed at the instigation of a Spanish magistrate seeking to extradite
the former leader for trial. The Spanish warrant accuses Pinochet
of presiding over crimes committed by his secret police after he
seized power in 1973, toppling President Salvador Allende, an
elected Marxist. The Chilean government has said some 3,000 people
died or disappeared during Pinochet's 17-year-rule.
	   ``I have lived with my conscience and my own memories for over
quarter of a century since the events of 1973,'' Pinochet's
statement said. ``I wish things could have been different ... But I
am at peace with myself, and with the Chilean people, about what
happened.''
	   Pinochet cannot be tried in Chile because he has immunity as a
senator-for-life, a job he created in a constitution he guided to
enactment before stepping down from power in 1990.
	   During the first two days of the appeal hearing last week,
lawyers for British and Spanish prosecutors and the Spanish
government argued that England's 1978 State Immunity Act, under
which the High Court quashed Pinochet's arrest, should be
superseded by international conventions on genocide that Britain
has signed onto.
	   The general remains under police guard in a north London
hospital, but a Chilean government jet is waiting at an air base
north of London to take him home should he be set free by the
British courts.
	   ``God willing, I shall return home to Chile with my family where
I hope to live the last years of my life in peace,'' Pinochet's
statement said.

Former top executives of failed Japanese supermarket chain
</HEADLINE>
arrested &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Three former top executives of Yaohan Japan Corp.
supermarket chain operator were arrested Monday on suspicion of
falsifying financial reports and paying illegal dividends.
	   Yaohan Japan has been under court protection from its creditors
since last year after accumulating massive debts left over from an
aggressive expansion into Asia and North America during the 1980s.
	   The three arrested Monday were Terumasa Wada, 67; Akihiko
Tsukamoto, 55, former head of the company's accounting department;
Kyoichi Okada, 49, former president of the now defunct Yaohan
Finance Co, said Kazuya Saegusa, a Shizuoka Prefectural Police
spokesman.
	   The three are suspected of manipulating Yaohan Japan's financial
statements to show more than 15 billion yen (dlrs 127 million) in
profits between April 1993 and March 1996, Kyodo News said.
	   Police believe Yaohan Japan also falsified its books by
transferring losses to related companies in China or Singapore over
the period, Saegusa said.
	   They are also suspected of illegally paying 1.38 billion yen
(dlrs 11.59 million) in dividends to shareholders in 1996, Kyodo
reported.
	   Monday's arrests came one month after police raided Yaohan
Japan's head office in Numazu and other related offices on Oct. 9
in violation of the nation's Commercial law.
	   Numazu is 150 kilomters (93 miles), west of Tokyo.
	   Last month, Genzo Yamazaki, a trustee of Yaohan Japan, filed
criminal complaints against several Yaohan executives over alleged
falsification of financial statements.
	   Yaohan was among a slew of Japanese companies that went bankrupt
last year. The food retailer filed for protection with about 171.16
billion yen (dlrs 1.43 billion) in outstanding debts.
	   Last November, part of the Yaohan group, Yaohan Department
Stores, closed all of its nine Hong Kong outlets and one in Macau,
dismissing 2,700 people.

Amnesty urges APEC to consider human rights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Asian-Pacific nations should
include human rights on the agenda when meet this month in Malaysia
to discuss economic recovery, Amnesty International said Monday.
	   ``People who are suffering the effects of the economic downturn
have a right to be heard and to organize themselves to protect
their livelihoods.'' the London-based human rights group said in a
statement.
	   Economic reforms ``cannot be dealt with in isolation from
recognition and respect for fundamental human rights, such as
freedom of expression and association,'' the group said.
	   The call for greater focus on human rights comes as Malaysia _
the host for this year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum _
faces international criticism for its handling of top dissident
Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Anwar was fired as deputy premier and finance minister and
arrested in September, triggering widespread protests. The
government reacted with a wave of arrests and bans on
demonstrations and some political groups.
	   Anwar has appeared in court with a black eye and bruises, and
many APEC leaders, including U.S. President Bill Clinton, have
refused to hold bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad over human rights concerns.
	   Preliminary APEC meetings start this week. The Nov. 17-18 summit
of 20 Pacific Rim leaders does not include human rights in its
formal agenda. The gathering is expected to grapple with the
effects of the Asian economic turmoil and the larger global
financial crisis.
	   ``APEC's traditional reluctance to raise issues about human
rights is short sighted,'' said Amnesty's regional representative,
John Kellock, in a speech in Kuala Lumpur on Monday.
	   ``As Malaysia's own case shows, freedom of expression and
association are fundamental to tackling problems of transparency
and corruption,'' he said.
	   Amnesty demanded that speeches by leaders reflect concerns over
human rights and that the summit encourage members to ratify and
implement international standards.
	   On Sunday, officials in Ottawa announced Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien will avoid any one-to-one meeting with Mahathir.
Chretien will be seated next to Mahathir at the meeting and will
use the opportunity to raise human rights issues, Canadian
officials said.

China promises fair, honest election for Macau governor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China has promised to conduct a fair and open
election for the first chief executive to govern Macau after it
reverts to Chinese rule, the official China Daily reported Monday.
	   Vice Premier Qian Qichen _ the most senior official overseeing
the Portuguese colony's transfer on Dec. 19, 1999 _ made the pledge
Saturday at the end of a meeting of a committee preparing for the
handover. The committee adopted a set of rules for the election.
	   ``We will comply with the principles of fairness, equity,
openness, democracy and honesty'' in the election, the newspaper
quoted Qian as saying at the meeting in Zhuhai, the Chinese city
bordering Macau.
	   Although the report did not provide details, Macau's elections
are likely to follow the process carried out in Hong Kong, the
larger and financially vibrant British colony that China recovered
on July 1, 1997.
	   Like Hong Kong, voting in Macau's election for chief executive
will be restricted to members of an elite election committee
handpicked by the preparatory committee _ whose members were
selected by Beijing.
	   Chinese and Portuguese negotiations over the handover have been
conducted with little of the rancor that beset Beijing and London
in the final years of British rule in Hong Kong. With gang violence
sharpening over dwindling casino payoffs, Beijing, however, has
prodded Lisbon to do more to improve security in Macau.
	   In addition to passing the election rules, the preparatory
committee also set up a panel to organize the handover ceremonies
and approved a bill to China's legislature on citizenship in
post-Portuguese Macau, China Daily reported.
	   Qian said China and Portugal agreed that Macau residents of
mixed ancestry may choose either Chinese or Portuguese citizenship.
	   About 10,000 of Macau's 450,000 residents are Eurasians, mainly
a mixture of Chinese and Portuguese. The so-called Macanese mostly
hold Portuguese passports.

San Miguel chairman confirms Lucio Tan buyout offer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Eduardo Cojuangco Jr., chairman of
San Miguel Corp., has confirmed that tobacco, beer and airline
magnate Lucio Tan offered to buy out his stake in the company.
	   Cojuangco said over the weekend that the offer came shortly
after he was elected four months ago to the top post of San Miguel,
the Philippines' largest food and beverage conglomerate. He later
turned down the deal.
	   Tan made the offer even as his own company, Philippine Airlines
Inc., was being forced to seek debt relief because of its inability
to pay dlrs 2.1 billion in debt.
	   Tan also heads Asia Brewery Inc., San Miguel's chief rival in
the domestic beer market.
	   Cojuangco said he had to turn down the offer because his 20
percent stake in San Miguel is still under government confiscation
because of cases questioning his ownership before the Supreme Court
and an anti-graft court.
	   The government, through the Presidential Commission on Good
Government, confiscated Cojuangco's stake in San Miguel in 1986,
claiming it was acquired using ill-gotten wealth.
	   The PCGG was formed that same year to recover the assets of the
late President Ferdinand Marcos and his allies, who included
Cojuangco.
	   While the ownership of Cojuangco's 20 percent stake in San
Miguel has yet to be resolved, he was allowed by the anti-graft
court to vote his shares during the company's stockholders' meeting
in April, paving the way for his return in San Miguel.
	   Aside from Tan, Cojuangco said Hong Kong's First Pacific Co.
Ltd. also made an offer to buy his 20 percent stake in San Miguel.
	   The offer was also turned down for the same reason Tan's bid was
rejected, he said.
	   First Pacific bought a 2 percent stake in San Miguel in late
1997, but this was sold some time this year after First Pacific
decided against increasing its stake in the food and beverage
company.

China arrests three for bold futures scam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police in China's capital have arrested three
people for running a sham investment house that bilked thousands of
investors out of tens of millions of dollars.
	   The collapse of the Xinguoda Futures Brokerage Co. Ltd.
triggered small-scale protests outside the Communist Party
headquarters this summer and underscores the government's problems
regulating a fledgling and freewheeling securities industry.
	   Among the three arrested were Ni Wenliang _ a 41-year-old native
of central China who lives in Taiwan and carries a Belize passport
_ described as the ``leader of the criminal clique,'' the official
Xinhua News Agency reported Sunday.
	   Ni along with Gao Zhenyu and Gong Congying _ the other two
arrested _ set up firms to buy Xinguoda, lured investors with
promises of high returns and conducted trades on a ``fake
exchange'' in eastern Shandong province, Xinhua said.
	   As of Nov. 5, Xinguoda had taken in 532 million yuan (dlrs 64
million) from 4,121 investors and paid out 169 million yuan (dlrs
20 million) in profits and interests, Xinhua said.
	   Meanwhile, police confiscated 22 million yuan (dlrs 2.6 million)
in cash, cars and property and found another 140 million yuan (dlrs
17 million) spirited abroad or hidden inside China, Xinhua said.
	   Investigators are trying to trace the rest of the money.

for a touchdown with less than two minutes to go for Tennessee.

third quarter. Joe Bowden's 1-yard interception return for a TD put
Tennessee up 24-16 with just under 11 minutes to go.

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Nationwide elections on Sunday were
for governors and members of congress, but Venezuelans also were
deciding the political fortunes of a failed coup leader running for
president on an anti-corruption, anti-establishment platform.
	   Supported by millions of peasants and shantytown dwellers, a new
movement led by Hugo Chavez, who took up arms against the
government six years ago, appeared poised for a strong showing in
Sunday's congressional vote. Chavez is also the front-runner to win
the Dec. 6 presidential election.
	   Initial results indicated Chavez's Patriotic Pole coalition
would pick up 7 of Venezuela's 23 governorships. With about 60
percent of the vote counted in the gubernatorial races, the two
oldest parties _ the center-left Democratic Action Party and the
conservative Copei Party _ were set to win the governorships in
most of the rest of the country.
	   The traditional parties had been expected to dominate the
gubernatorial races. But in a surprise showing, Chavez's father,
Hugo de los Reyes Chavez, was ahead in the race for governor in the
western state of Barinas.
	   The Patriotic Pole's candidate for governor in Zulia state,
incumbent Francisco Arias Cardenas, was also ahead. He was one of
the army officers who participated in Chavez's 1992 coup attempt.
	   At midnight local time, results of the congressional race were
still not available.
	   Venezuelans were voting for 23 governors, 48 senators, 189
members of congress and 391 state assembly members.
	   Patriotic Pole appeared to have a good chance of winning the
largest share of Congress, which is currently dominated by Copei
and Democratic Action.
	   ``I am optimistic because the people are alert, with their eyes
wide open,'' said Chavez as he voted Sunday amid shouts of ``Hugo!
Hugo!''
	   With Venezuelan politics taking on overtones of class warfare,
officials feared an outbreak of violence Sunday. They dispatched
about 100,000 soldiers and police to ensure peaceful voting,
expelled the local election board in the country's second-most
populous state, and prohibited the sale of liquor and the carrying
of weapons.
	   President Rafael Caldera, whose army chief recently implied the
armed forces would seek to block Chavez's rise to power, cast his
ballot and declared the vote ``an expression of the will of the
people.''
	   In a country where fraud allegations often surround elections,
Caldera promised the results would be ``respected completely and in
a transparent, clean and honest way.''
	   About 11 million of Venezuela's 23 million residents were
eligible to vote and turnout looked strong.
	   The voting was plagued by long lines and confusion over
complicated ballots, however. Voting machines that were being used
for the first time in Venezuela malfunctioned in many balloting
stations.
	   In a front-page plea to its readers, the Caracas newspaper El
Universal tried to calm tensions.
	   ``We call for serenity, balance and strict respect for the
electoral results, as an expression of a sacred social pact,'' it
said.
	   The one presidential candidate who seems to be able to channel
anti-Chavez sentiment is Henrique Salas, a Yale-educated
businessman seen as pro-business and pro-markets.
	   But Salas doesn't seem to have the passionate popular support
enjoyed by Chavez, and he does not have much political machinery to
bring out the vote for his center-right Project Venezuela Party on
Sunday.
	   President Caldera's party, Convergence, which broke away from
Copei five years ago, is not expected to be a major player in these
elections.
	   The traditional parties had been expected to do better in the
gubernatorial races because many of the candidates are incumbents
who have spent years handing out political favors.
	   Some of the candidates running on Chavez's ticket are former
army officers who participated in his 1992 coup attempt against
then-President Carlos Andres Perez.
	   Perez himself is running for senate while under house arrest in
his home state of Tachira pending charges of illegal enrichment. If
he wins as expected, he will receive parliamentary immunity and be
freed.
	   Many people blame Copei and Democratic Action for the country's
declining living standards and for squandering Venezuela's vast oil
wealth.
	   ``Chavez is the antithesis of the democratic decay this country
has had,'' said Ivan Hernandez, a 52-year-old high school teacher
who said he is voting for Patriotic Pole.

Students gather to protest Indonesian government assembly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Hundreds of students gathered at
several universities on Monday to protest a government assembly
that will debate democratic reforms. Fearing clashes, thousands of
police and soldiers patrolled the streets.
	   The students planned to take buses or march to Parliament, where
1,000 delegates to the People's Consultative Assembly will meet
Tuesday to cast rules for general elections scheduled next year.
	   Many student activists reject the assembly as a haven for
cronies of former President Suharto, who quit in May after riots
and protests against his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   Suharto's successor and onetime protege, President B.J. Habibie,
has promised the four-day meeting will be ``a milestone'' on the
road to democracy.
	   He wants parliamentary elections to be held next May, followed
by the selection of a new head of state by a newly designed
Assembly at the end of 1999. Habibie has also freed some political
prisoners and allowed political parties to form, but his critics
accuse him of maneuvering to stay in power.
	   The military has deployed 30,000 police and soldiers in Jakarta,
the capital, to safeguard the assembly and the Parliament grounds
have resembled an armed camp in recent days.
	   The convening of the Assembly comes as the world's fourth most
populous nation grapples with Indonesia's worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   Inflation and unemployment are high, and millions of people are
sinking into poverty. Rioting and looting over price rises have
occurred sporadically since May in many areas.
	   There has been some positive economic news in recent days, with
the fragile currency recovering some of its value and interest
rates declining.
	   However, fears of unrest at the assembly this week have undercut
some of the rupiah's recent gains and many foreign businesses
remain reluctant to invest in Indonesia because of the political
uncertainty.
