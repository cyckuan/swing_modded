<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Confers with Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji said here
today that China is satisfied with the noticeable growth of
Sino-Saudi Arabian relations in political, economic, cultural and
judicial fields.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during his talks with Crown Prince Abdullah
Ibn Abdul Aziz Al Saud, deputy prime minister and head of the
National Guard of Saudi Arabia, here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the crown prince is the first leader of Saudi Arabia
to visit China since the establishment of the diplomatic ties
between the two countries in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The visit, a major event in Sino-Saudi Arabian relations, will
go down as a new chapter of friendship and cooperation between the
two countries, Zhu noted.
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Adbullah first conveyed greeting from King Fahd to
the Chinese people, and said China is the closest friend of Saudi
Arabia, whose people have been following closely China's
contributions to world peace and the progressive cause of humanity.
</P>
<P>
Fairly big advances have been made in Sino-Saudi Arabian trade
relations after the forging of diplomatic ties between the two
countries and Saudi Arabia has become China's largest trade
partner in the West Asia-Africa region.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, the two economies are compatible with each
other with great potential to be tapped in the future. He
expressed the belief that the Crown Prince's China visit will
boost the economic and trade development between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China and Saudi Arabia are two major nations
respectively in East and West Asia and have adopted independent
foreign policy for peace, Zhu said that the two nations, sharing
similar and identical views on major international affairs, are
also making efforts to develop their national economy and improve
the living standards of their people. "We two have vast prospects
for cooperation in all fields," he acknowledged.

Crown Prince Abdullah agreed on Zhu's views on bilateral ties,
saying that his country attached importance to its relations with
China and hoped that his visit can enhanced such ties.
</P>
<P>
On Middle-east issue, Zhu said China is concerned with the
recent stalemate of Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. "The key to
end the stalemate hinges on the effective implementation of the
relative UN resolutions reached by all parties based on the
principle of 'Land for Peace' as it stipulated in Madrid
Conference," Zhu stressed.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that China appreciates Saudi Arabia's important
contributions to safeguarding the just rights and interests of the
Arab states and supporting the Palestinian people in their
struggle to recover its just national rights.
</P>
<P>
Zhu went on to say that China, as a permanent member of the UN
Security Council, will join efforts with international community
and urge relevant parties to adopt flexible and practical stance
in a bid to realize the thorough and just settlement of the Middle
East issue.
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Abdullah said that Middle East peace process meet
with difficulties but he thought this situation "can not last
long." He expressed his belief that the just cause of the Arab
people will surely win the final victory. "As an influential
country in the world, China wins the respect of Arab countries,"
he said, adding that he hoped that China will continue to play a
still more important role in Middle East issue.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also had an exchange of views on Asian financial
crisis and other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Zhu hosted a welcoming ceremony in honor of
Crown Prince Abdullah.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK Official Defends Stability of HK Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 14 (Xinhua) --- Joseph Yam, chief executive
of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) Wednesday expressed his
resolve to defend the stability of Hong Kong currency, brushing
aside accusations against HKMA's intervention in August to ward
off speculations on Hong Kong stock and contract market.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon jointly hosted by the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region Government and the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council, Yam said free markets do not mean that
markets can be freely manipulated.
</P>
<P>
"They need to be fair markets as well," he said. "We have a
responsibility to tackle market manipulation and avoid serious
market dislocation developing."
</P>
<P>
Turning to accusations that Hong Kong was trying to jack up the
market against trends dictated by fundamentals, Yam detailed on
the cause and effects of HKMA's move, saying the aim had been to
deter market manipulation, not to jack the market.
</P>
<P>
The HKMA's actions had been successful and there has been no
indication of further market manipulation since the end of August,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
"This (manipulation) can be highly damaging to the stability of
the whole financial system of Hong Kong," he said. "It also
presents the serious risk of undermining general confidence in our
currency."
</P>
<P>
He also repudiated the accusation that Hong Kong had
dangerously departed from the currency board discipline and
ventured into discretionary monetary management.
</P>
<P>
Joseph is in Singapore to attend the Seventh East Asia Economic
Summit which is organized by the Switzerland-based World Economic
Forum and the Economic Development Board of Singapore. The summit

<HEADLINE> Primakov Sets Forward Anti-Crisis Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov Wednesday outlined the concept of a government-proposed
anti-crisis program and the main problems confronting the country,
Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Federal Council (upper house of parliament),
Primakov said it is important to pool efforts of the government
and regions to bring Russia out of the current difficult stage of
development.
</P>
<P>
He said the main problems in Russia now are wage and pension
arrears, which are the top question to be addressed, and the
paralysis of the banking system.
</P>
<P>
A considerable part of Russia's economy was not
functioning. The imports dropped by 75 percent, with those of
foodstuffs registering an even greater fall, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said taxes revenues sharply dwindled because of lack
of customs duties, the gross domestic products dropped by 16
percent, real incomes by 11 percent, and the ruble has devaluated.
</P>
<P>
Calling for a cooperation among regions in overcoming those
problems, Primakov said, "the country needs further privatization
programs to develop the real economy and improve living standards."
</P>
<P>
He suggested that regional leaders should cooperate with the
cabinet on this matter.
</P>
<P>
The next step is to disentangle non-payments between
enterprises, and that move will help revitalize the economy,
Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reported that the government-defined order
of debt repayment by organizations will be financed through the
federal budget.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of reorganization of the banking system, Primakov
said, "banks which survived the crisis will operate in the future,
too. Banks which are not viable at all will not survive in the
future either."
</P>
<P>
Primakov said Russia's taxes will be cut, including the
value-added tax and the income tax. The present system is being
streamlined to receive "sufficient" taxes from commodity
monopolies without damaging export, he said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's address received support from the Federation
Council. Yegor Stroyev, Chairman of the Federation Council, said
the upper house supports Primakov's proposals on measures to
overcome the recent problems. The Federation Council will also put
forward its own proposals.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev said the cooperation between the government and the
heads of inter-regional associations will make it possible to find
the best way to make state decisions.
</P>
<P>
Russian Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said Primakov
"demonstrated a pragmatic approach to the current situation."
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the Communist Party will support
economic recovery measures.

<HEADLINE> Plants May Help Extract Gold From Soil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Christopher Anderson of
Massey University in New Zealand and his colleagues said they have
found a way to sharply increase the amount of gold plants can
extract from the soil, reported the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have long known that plants can pull gold and other
metals out of the soil. But this "phytomining" typically occurs in
extremely low levels.
</P>
<P>
Anderson and his colleagues conducted a series of experiments
in which they added the chemical ammonium thiocyanate to the soil
of potted Indian mustard plants and found it sharply boosted the
amount of gold extracted. They said that the same way could work
for other plants as well.
</P>
<P>
They said that induced hyperaccumulation of gold appears to be
relatively independent of plant species, so it should be possible
to use plants that might be easy to grow on mine tailings.

HEFEI, China, October 14 (Xinhua)-- New Zealand upset hosts
China at the opening match of the four-team international women's
basketball tournament which kicks off Wednesday at the first leg
of Fengyang, An'hui.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese players exposed their shortfall of experience to
the visiting New Zealand opponents although they held a 44-39
into the second half.
</P>
<P>
The host, aged 22 on average, has kept their lead all the way
through the first half by exploring their speed to their
advantage, which is countered by the visitors with frequent
substitutes trying to keep themselves in the game.
</P>
<P>
The poor inside attacking cost the hosts greatly when the
visitors final took over the lead and snatched a 77-79 win.

In the other match on Wednesday, Chinese Taipei kept their
dominance to the final whistle with a 87-63 victory without
allowing any chance to the United States, represented by a ABL
professional club.

<P>
The United States boasted a repertoire of experience and
overshadowed their opponents with bigger sizes, only to be
outwitted by the winner with their well-ploted organization and
high shooting percentage.

<HEADLINE> APPCED Urged to Discuss Nuclear Waste Disposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican and Iraqi delegates
suggested here today to add the issue of nuclear waste disposal to
the agenda of the next annual conference of a regional
environmental conference.
</P>
<P>
They made the remark in the Sixth Annual Meeting of the
Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians Conference on Environment and
Development (APPCED), to be opened tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Armando Galvan Gazcon, a member of the Mexican delegation,
criticized the recent resolution passed by the U.S. Congress on the
disposal of nuclear waste along the U.S.-Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources revealed the United States has allocated a
site to dump and treat nuclear established a nuclear waste dumping
facility a mere 20 miles to the U.S.-Mexican border. He cited the
American claim of the lack of any danger to Mexicans as simply
preposterous. He also mentioned an investigation conducted by
Mexicans living in the area which revealed that the facility does
threaten their health.
</P>
<P>
"If the facility is indeed safe, why did the U.S. Congress
refrain from approving the burial of nuclear waste in inland
areas, rather than on the U.S.-Mexican border?" Gazcon asked.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi delegates also addressed the issue, and suggested that
the next assembly in Thailand should discuss effective solutions
to problems related to nuclear pollution. More importantly,
according to the Iraqi delegation, discussion should center on how
to prevent the reoccurrence of a similar situation.
</P>
<P>
Peter Hodgson, acting president of the APPCED Executive
Committee and a member of the New Zealand House of
Representatives, said that the valuable suggestions are indeed
worthy of further discussion.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday called
on the two countries with the largest nuclear arsenals to
implement their bilateral agreements on nuclear disarmament as
soon as possible and further reduce their nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
"This will not only have positive impact on international peace
and security, but also create favorable conditions for other
nuclear-weapon states to participate in the nuclear disarmament
process at an early date," said Chinese representative Li Changhe.
</P>
<P>
Li, China's ambassador for disarmament affairs, told the First
Committee of the 53rd Session of the U.N. General Assembly that as
a nuclear-weapon state, China never participates in nuclear arms
race, nor has it ever evaded its responsibility on nuclear
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"We have all along stood for the complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and has unilaterally and
unconditionally undertaken not to be the first to use nuclear
weapons, and not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against
non-nuclear weapon states or nuclear-weapons-free zones," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li said, "We also call for the early conclusion of a
convention banning nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Through appropriate steps and phases, the reductions will be
achieved gradually from the larger arsenals to the smaller ones
until the ultimate objective of nuclear disarmament is
accomplished, freeing mankind from the menace of nuclear war," he
said.

<HEADLINE> 1999 Employment Guidelines Adopted by Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Reforms on tax and benefit
systems, more open access to job market and better exploitation
of services sector job potential were the key points in the
employment guidelines adopted on Wednesday by the European
Commission for next year.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, also stressed the importance of life-long learning and
reconciling work and family life in an effort to create more jobs
union-wide.
</P>
<P>
It proposed, as limited adjustments for next year's employment
policy, such active measures as to render jobs and job-related
education more attractive, to prepare a skilled and adaptable
workforce, to open labor market to all, to create more jobs in the
services sector and to pay more attention to affordable and
accessible high-quality care services to relieve workforce of its
family life concerns.
</P>
<P>
Commission officials said that though 800,000 new jobs were
added to the EU labor market in 1997, overall employment rate in
the union was still on the decline, compared with 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, the European Union employment rate was 64
percent whereas now the rate dropped to 60.5 percent. Employment
for the old and young people declined even more.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has taken employment as one of the crucial
tasks alongside the single currency and internal market.
</P>
<P>
The EU member states have worked out their individual
employment action plans and have to report to the commission on
their implementation of the national action plans on a yearly
basis.
</P>
<P>
European Employment Commissioner Padraig Flynn said that the
success of improving long-term employment union-wide depends on
the implementation of the measures agreed upon among member
states.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Nicosia House Awarded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- A 19th century house built in
Nicosia over tombs dating to the Hellenistic age were awarded
Wednesday an Europa Nostra award for their renovation and
preservation work.
</P>
<P>
The two-story house, which is situated in the old and
picturesques neighborhood Ayioi Omologites of Nicosia, was chosen
among 150 applications from 21 countries.
</P>
<P>
The four ancient tombs, which are in the house, in the verandah
area and in the garden, were found during the renovation
and restoration work and have been well preserved.
</P>
<P>
The house was given the award for the good preservation work,
with the use of traditional materials, methods and constructural
details.
</P>
<P>
According to Europa Nostra, the preservation of the four tombs
is an excellent example of how archaeological sites in private
property can be preserved.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Antiquities Department believes the tombs in the house
are part of the Ayioi Omoligites ancient necropolis dating to the
Hellenistic period (323-58 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
Europa Nostra, a pan-European organization whose network
comprises over 200 non-governmental organizations in the field of
conservation, aims at the protection and enhancement of the
architectural and natural heritage, the encouragement of high
standards of architecture and the improvement of the environment.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Exports Decreases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' export volume in the
first seven months of this year decreased by 1.84 percent,
compared to that of the same period last year, resulting in a
slight increase of trade deficit by 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
A foreign trade statistics report, released here by the
Department of Statistics and Research Wednesday, said total
exports in this period were 364.9 million pounds (729.8 million
U.S. dollars) compared to 371.6 million pounds (743.2 million
dollars) in January-July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The imports totaled 1,109.5 million Cyprus pounds (2,219 million
dollars), compared with 1,113.8 million pounds (2227.6 million
dollars) in the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the above developments, the trade deficit
totaled 744.5 million pounds (1,489 million dollars), 2.3 million
pounds (4.6 million dollars) more than that in the first seven
months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report said the European Union (EU) countries' exports to
Cyprus accounted for 53 percent of Cyprus' total imports,
compared with 46.9 percent during January-July 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU countries imported 57.4 percent of Cyprus'
exports, followed by the Arab countries with a share of 23.7

<HEADLINE> Massive Funding Set for Controlling Huaihe River Pollution (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government plans to
allocate 15 billion yuan (1.8 billion US dollars) for the
construction of 57 water treatment plants along the seriously
polluted Huaihe River, according to Qu Geping, director of the
National People's Congress (NPC) Environment and Resources
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The massive plan calls for elimination pollution in the river
valley by the year 2000, Qu made the remarks just prior to the
opening of the Sixth Annual Assembly of the Asia-Pacific
Parliamentarians Conference on Environment and Development
(APPCED) on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the project will represent one of the major
environmental protection measures adopted by the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
Qu, an outstanding environmental worker in the ranks of
government, stressed that environmental protection is one of two
basic national policies.
</P>
<P>
"The government has adopted resolute measures in the regard,"
said Qu. China closed 63,000 polluting ventures over the past
three years, including more than 5,700 factories along the Huaihe
River.
</P>
<P>
China completed the first phase project to curb pollution along
the Huaihe river between 1994 and 1997. The second phase project
was launched last year. "All polluted water and sewage waste must
now meet drainage standards before release into the river,"
according to a local official.

Qu noted that similar clean-up projects are being carried on
Taihu, Chaohu and Dianchi lakes, as well as along the Haihe and
Liaohe river and in Beijing area. Total government funding for the
period from 1996 to 2000 is expected to hit 450 billion yuan, or
1.3 percent of the nation's GDP. The investment scale basically
equals levels in most developed countries. "Central and local
government investments in environmental protection, combined with
bank loans, are expected to reach 100 billion yuan in 1998 alone,"
according to Qu.
</P>
<P>
Rapid economic growth and certain policies in effect at one
point seriously threatened China's environment and resource
protection efforts. Various localities witnessed deteriorating
water and air pollution, as well as serious soil
erosion. Pollution along the Huaihe River formerly adversely
affected the quality of potable water.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress and central government attach
great importance to the protection of the environment and
resources, and continuously improve supervision to ensure
implementation of related laws. The NPC has promulgated 15 laws
which have established a comprehensive legal system to guarantee
protection, said Qu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government at all levels have attached equal
priority to environmental protection and economic development. All
projects are subject to environmental appraisals and approval,
said Qu, adding that funding to curb pollution has been increased
on annual basis.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges More Preventive Efforts for Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday called for more preventive strategies in
reducing natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the International Day for Natural Disaster
Reduction, which falls on October 14 this year, the U.N. chief
said, "Preparedness measures for more efficient rescue operations
will remain necessary, but we must first turn much greater
attention to the introduction of preventive strategies aimed at
saving lives and protecting assets before they are lost."
</P>
<P>
"Science and technology play a central role in reducing the
economic and social consequences of natural hazards," he said.
"This year's observance of the International Day highlights the
importance of information in communicating these technical
abilities and in sharing practical experiences to make communities
safer."
</P>
<P>
"Almost daily, we are reminded of the threat of natural
disasters," Annan said, adding that since the beginning of the
year, "we have endured catastrophic floods in Asia, deadly
hurricanes in the Americas and the serious consequences of EL Nino
on several continents."
</P>
<P>
"While we cannot stop the forces of nature, we can and must
prevent them from turning into major social and economic
disasters," he said.
</P>
<P>
Natural disasters "profoundly affect our efforts to achieve
sustainable development," he said.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the International Day of Natural Disaster
Reduction this year is "Prevention and Media -- Prevention begins
with information." The International Day falls on the second
Wednesday of October each year.
</P>
<P>
This is the ninth year in the program for the International
Decade for Natural Disasters, adopted by the General Assembly in
1989 and refined at the World Conference on Disaster Reduction in
Yokohoma, Japan.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Amartya Sen, "Conscience Keeper" of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Professor Amartya Sen, the
first Asian to win the Nobel Prize for economics Wednesday, has
won acclaim as "conscience keeper" of the world of economics by
probing into ethical and philosophical questions relating to
inequality and causes of poverty and famine.
</P>
<P>
Sen, 64, became a professor at the Jadhavpur University at just
24 and was a strong votary of social development and felt market
reforms had no meaning without it.
</P>
<P>
Sen, now in New York, was candid about India's economic reforms
and felt that despite overall economic growth, there was evidence
that economic expansion was not reaching the least fortunate in
the society.
</P>
<P>
Born on November 3, 1933, at Santiniketan, India's east state
of West Gengal, which was founded by another Indian Nobel laureate
Rabindranath Tagore, Sen has retained Indian citizenship despite
his long stay abroad as a professor.
</P>
<P>
Educated at Presidency College in Calcutta, 1,460 kilometers
Southeast of here, Sen went to Trinity College, Cambridge
University, where he acquired his bachelor and masters degrees and
doctorate.
</P>
<P>
He won the prestigious Adam Smith Prize, Wrenbury Scholarship
and Stevenson Prize at Trinity and later became master of the
college.
</P>
<P>
Sen, the sixth Indian to get Nobel Prize, has taught in his
motherland and various universities abroad including Harvard,
Oxford and London School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
As a versatile economist, Sen's writings ranged from choice of
technique, poverty, famine and inequality.
</P>
<P>
Sen returned to India in 1963 to teach at the Delhi School of
Economics for about nine years.
</P>
<P>
In his three decades of illustrious career, Sen held several
prestigious posts including presidentship of the American Economic
Association and International Economic Association.
</P>
<P>
He was also member of editorial boards of reputed journals like
Economica, Economics and Philosophy.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Multi-Party Talks Seem to Be in Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Talks between Lesotho's
rival parties seem to be heading for trouble as the opposition
parties push for a transitional council while the ruling party is
firmly opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance Wednesday called for the establishment
of the structure by an act of parliament before October 31, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD), however, said
it did not agree to such a structure because it is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the transitional council was proposed by
the Southern African Development Community (SADC) as the LCD and
its opposition rivals failed to agree on who should govern the
country before fresh general elections in 15 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
The proposed council will have access to information held by
the government that is relevant to the elections. It will also
take decisions on all electoral matters including the role of the
police, the military, the intelligence, finance, foreign affairs,
and media and publications. It will review Lesotho's electoral
system and appoint a new Independent Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
In a document to be presented at the Lesotho multi-party talks
under way in Maseru Wednesday, the opposition alliance said the
council should have executive and other powers as agreed to by
the parties and conferred upon it by the act of parliament,
according to SAPA.
</P>
<P>
The document said the objectives of the council would include
to facilitate and promote the preparation and holding of new
elections not later than March 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
It should also create and promote conditions conducive to free
and fair elections, ensure equal opportunities for all parties
seeking participation in the elections and eliminate any
impediment to political activities, including victimization of
employees on political grounds.
</P>
<P>
According to the opposition's proposal, the council should be
constituted by every party which fielded 40 or more candidates in
the May 23 elections. Each party should have three representatives.
</P>
<P>
The opposition also proposed that members of the council
should be paid a rate equivalent to that of government ministers.
</P>
<P>
In the document, the opposition alliance called for the review
and amendment of the country's constitution to provide for certain
measures including intervention by the head of state (the king)
in national crises such as the present one without reference
to any second party.
</P>
<P>
The parties also want the head of state to be declared the
commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
In its document presented to Wednesday's talks, the LCD said
the establishment of a transitional council would be tantamount
to overthrowing the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
It argued that such a structure is irrelevant as Lesotho is
not in transition. Lesotho has an elected parliament and
government, it added.
</P>
<P>
The LCD also argued that nowhere in the would are political
parties empowered to conduct general elections.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's talks are chaired by South African Safety and
Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi.

<HEADLINE> First Trans-Asia-Europe Optical Fiber Cable in Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The first trans-Asia-Europe optical
fibre telecom cable directly linking Frankfurt of Germany with
Shanghai of China went into operation on Wednesday, the Germany
telecom group, Deutsche Telekom, announced.
</P>
<P>
According to a spokesman of the Deutsche Telekom, the
state-of-the-art optical fiber link, called Trans-Asia-Europe Optical
Fiber Cable System (TAE), is the longest terrestrial cable system in
the world with a total span of 17,000 kilometers, running from Shanghai
through Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran, Turkey, Ukraine,
Poland, Romania, Hungary, Austria to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Combined with national networks along the stretch, the cable will
be finally developed into a huge intercontinental network covering 20
countries in Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Built by a consortium of telecom companies, including the Deutsche
Telekom and China Telecom, the cable is able to carry voice telephony
and data traffic with a capacity of twice 155-megabit per second,
equivalent to around 4,000 telephone calls made simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The Deutsche Telecom said that the system could also be upgraded to
deal with the surge in telecom traffic in the future.
</P>
<P>
The investment on the TAE, including the final expansion, would run
up to about 600 million U.S. dollars, the company said.

<HEADLINE> General Assembly Meets on U.S. Embargo Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The 53rd General
Assembly (GA) session Wednesday convened a plenary meeting to
discuss the necessity of ending the economic, commercial and
financial embargo imposed by the United States on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The meeting considered a report by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, who submitted the report on September 3 at the request of a
GA resolution, adopted on November 5, 1997, which demanded an end
to the U.S. embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Annan listed replies he received from
governments on the issue, and most of the governments called for
an immediate end to such an embargo under the principle of the
U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
Yu Qingtai, member of the Chinese delegation, took the floor at
the plenary meeting to express the views of the Chinese government
on the issue, saying that "with the cold war behind us for quite a
few years, this situation should not be permitted to continue."
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly has repeatedly adopted resolutions calling
on all countries not to continue implementation of laws that are
contrary to the principles contained in the U.N. Charter and basic
norms of international relations, or detrimental to the legitimate
economic interests of third countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable that the government of the United States of
America has not responded positively to this appeal from the
international community, and has persisted in refusing to
implement the relevant U.N.G.A. resolutions," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions and embargoes by the United States over the years
have created great difficulties to the Cuban people's endeavors to
achieve economic and social development, as well as their
restructuring process, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a consequence, improvements in the living standards of the
Cuban people have been hampered, with particularly harmful effects
on the health and wellbeing of women and children," he said. "This
is clear violation of the human rights of the people of another
country."
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, the unilateral actions by the U.S. have also
obstructed normal economic and trade relations between Cuba and
many other countries, causing damage to their legitimate rights
and interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
"With the cold war behind us for quite a few years, this
situation should not be permitted to continue. History has shown
us that differences among nations can be settled effectively only
through dialogue and negotiations on the basis of equality and
respect for each other's independent choices," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the United States would take constructive
action in line with the prevailing trend of our era," he added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to adopt a resolution, U.N. officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Washington has been maintaining the economic, commercial and
financial embargo against Cuba for nearly 40 years. The impact of
the entire policy, together with the Helms-Burton Act against
interested companies, has already cost the Cuban economy more than
60 billion U.S. dollars, representing about three times the value
of the country's gross domestic product.

Mogadishu's administration can now guarantee the security of
the aid workers together with their properties, Ali Mahdi said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Russians May Fly With NATO Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke said Wednesday Russia had offered to fly reconnaissance
flights over Kosovo as part of the monitoring of a settlement of
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I might add, and say out here for the first time, that the
Russians have said they would like to fly with us, which would be
pretty amazing," said Holbrooke in an interview with the National
Broadcasting Company (NBC).
</P>
<P>
However, Holbrooke, who negotiated the settlement with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, gave no further details of Russia's
offer, or the U.S. response to such an offer.
</P>
<P>
Russia has strongly opposed military action against Yugoslavia.
It welcomed the Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement, under which the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will provide aerial
verification of compliance on the ground.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials say this will involve "unrestricted" NATO aerial
surveillance to quickly detect violations. Serb air defenses will
be removed from Kosovo or stored in cantonment areas to avoid any
threat to the surveillance flights.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Holbrooke-Milosevic agreement calls for a team
of 2,000 ground monitors to verify compliance, to be assembled by
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
Russia, an OSCE member, will participate in the ground
inspection mission.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said Milosevic was forced to make "enormous
concessions" in pledging to end Serbian attacks in Kosovo and
avoid NATO-sponsored air strikes.
</P>
<P>
"We came to the brink of war in the last few days in Europe --
the most serious crisis since the end of the Cold War. The planes
were on the runway and still are ready to go," he said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said that solutions to the violence in Kosovo lay in
the promises made by Milosevic buttressed by a future political
framework.
</P>
<P>
"I can see a way out of the crisis which is the fact that we
were about to go to war over Kosovo and now we've got something
better than war," he said.

<HEADLINE> China on Outer Space Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on
Disarmament should work toward negotiating a treaty on the
prevention of weaponization of outer space, China's representative
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Li Changhe for Disarmament Affairs made the remarks
at the First Committee of the 53rd Session of the U.N. General
Assembly. He noted that the activities in developing and testing
outer space weapons systems have intensified in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Some of the systems are entirely deployed in outer space or
targeted at objects in outer space, and others are based in outer
space to provide target information or guidance for ground weapon
systems, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As a consequence of such activities, outer space will be
turned into a weapon base and battle field, and regional and
global strategic stability will be undermined," Li stressed.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the Conference on Disarmament, the single
multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, re-establish the Ad
Hoc Committee to negotiate a treaty on the prevention of
weaponization of outer space to complement the existing legal
instruments.

<HEADLINE> ARATS Official Reiterates One-China Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Tang Shubei, executive
vice-president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), said here today that the two sides across the
Taiwan Straits should first have mutual trust under the one-China
principle.
</P>
<P>
China's sovereignty and territorial integrity cannot be
separated, although the two sides have not yet got united, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Both Wang Daohan, president of the ARATS, and Koo Chen-fu,
chairman of the Taiwan Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF), talked
about sincerity and mutual trust during their meeting today in
Shanghai, Tang said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
There has been indeed disparity between the two sides on who
represents China since 1949, but there is a tacit agreement, or
mutual trust, between the two sides that there is only one China
in the world and Taiwan is part of China, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the mutual trust was weakened somewhat in the 1990s,
especially since 1993, Tang noted, referring to the various
notions put forward by the Taiwan side, such as "one country, two
governments," "one country, two equal political entities," and so
on.
</P>
<P>
Tang noted we can't say there are "two Chinas" only because
China has not been reunified.
</P>
<P>
In referring to the interpretation of "one China," Tang said
his association had clarified it in a letter to the SEF on
November 16, 1992.
</P>
<P>
The ARATS held that "both sides of the Taiwan Straits adhere to
the one-China principle and seek peaceful reunification, but talks
on practical issues across the Taiwan Straits will not involve
political implication of one China," he said.
</P>
<P>
The SEF, however, said "in the course of seeking peaceful
reunification, both sides of the Taiwan Straits adhere to the one
China principle, but differ in the understanding of the one-China
concept."
</P>
<P>
The interpretations demonstrate that both sides are seeking
peaceful reunification and adhering to the one-China principle, he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Tang also quoted Wang as saying that both sides should make
joint efforts and hold negotiations on an equal footing on the
reunification under the one-China principle and that Taiwan's
political status can be discussed only under the one-China
principle.

<HEADLINE> Oil Search Resumed in Nigeria's Deep Offshore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Two joint oil companies in
Nigeria have resumed their drilling operation in the nation's
deep offshore after a year's break and are scheduled to drill two
more exploration wells in the next three months.
</P>
<P>
Under an exploration program, British Petroleum (Nigeria)
Limited (BP) and Norwegian Statoil Nigeria Limited will drill
three wells at a cost of 150 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
This is expected to raise their total investment in
exploration activities in deep offshore in 1994-1998, to 300
million U.S. Dollars, The Guardian newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of BP Nigeria, Mark Eames, said that the
outcome of the current drilling operation, started last month,
will determine the fate of the eight-year-old alliance of the two
companies to hold on the two blocks assigned to the alliance by
the Nigerian government in 1991.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that results of the seismic data acquired by
them on the two blocks were believed to show that the two blocks
may contain hydrocarbon resources.
</P>
<P>
BP/Statoi drilling operations are coming in the wake of
similar efforts by another deep offshore operations of ELF
Petroleum in conjunction with Chevron, Exxon and Canadian
Petrolem.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, about 22 exploration wells had been
drilled by some eight companies in Nigeria's deep water basin
estimated to boost the nation's oil production capability of 3
million barrels per day (bpd) by about 500,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
But only eight out of the 22 wells, which cost between 30
million and 50 million Dollars each, have signs of oil stock in
commercial quantities.

<HEADLINE> hke101481 -Taliban Agree to Free All Iranian Prisoners: UN Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
Wednesday agreed to release all Iranian prisoners following
assurances from a special U.N. envoy that Iran would also free all
Taliban prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during a four-and-a-half hour meeting
between visiting U.N. Special Envoy on Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi
and Taliban supreme leader Mohammad Omar in the militia's
headquarters of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference at Islamabad Airport Wednesday
evening on his return from one-day long visit to Kandahar, Brahimi
said arrangements will be made to bring the Iranian prisoners from
Kandahar Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi said Omar expressed regret over the killing of Iranian
diplomats and condemned the incident and expressed readiness to
hold international inquiry into the killing of Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban leader also said that no Taliban commander was
involved in the murder of the Iranian diplomats and the Taliban
have already initiated probe to apprehend the killers.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi told Omar that the United Nations would back direct
contact between Iran and the Taliban to sort out their disputes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a report reaching here from Kandahar quoted Taliban
spokesman Abdul Hae Mutmaen as saying that the Taliban had also
agreed to hold a face-to-face meeting with Iranian officials in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in a bid to normalize bilateral relations,
which have sharply deteriorated in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in Jeddah will be held soon under the auspices of
the 52-nation Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, who was accompanied by OIC Assistant Secretary General
Ibrahim Baker, described his talks with the Taliban's supreme
leader as "very promising."
</P>
<P>
"I am very, very hopeful," said Brahimi, who arrived in
Islamabad Thursday night from Tehran in a bid to defuse the
current tension between Iran and the Afghan Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy, who flew into Kandahar Wednesday morning from
Islamabad, described his talks with Omar as "useful and
constructive" and said the talks would help reduce tension between
Iran and the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi dissident, Brahimi
said "we raised the issue of terrorism with the Taliban side and
Omar said that the Taliban condemn all types of terrorism
throughout the world."
</P>
<P>
"If the Taliban receive any substantial evidence about Osama's
involvement in terrorist activities, then the Taliban are ready to
put him on trial," Omar told Brahimi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two sides discussed U.N. difficulties in
Taliban- controlled areas and the investigation into the murder of
a U.N. official in Kabul in August.
</P>
<P>
According to the envoy, Omar reiterated the Taliban's stand to
put complete ban on poppy cultivation in Afghanistan if the
Taliban are recognized.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Brahimi said he assured the Taliban leader that
the U.N. is ready to help Afghan growers in substitution of poppy
crops with others.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Threatens S. Africa's Demography: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The spiraling rate of HIV
infection and AIDS among South African women of child-bearing age
had dire implications for the country's demography, a survey
released Wednesday warned.
</P>
<P>
The highest incidence of HIV infection (20 percent) was found
in women in the 20 to 24 age group in 1997. An estimated 18
percent of women in the 25-29 age group were infected, according
to the survey conducted by the South African Institute of Race
Relations.
</P>
<P>
The high HIV infection rate among child-bearing women
threatens the country's demography because about a third of
children born to HIV-positive mothers would be infected at birth,
while more will be infected through breast-feeding, which is
common in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In KwaZulu-Natal Province, which has the worst HIV-AIDS
situation, an estimated 26.9 percent of women attending antenatal
clinics were HIV-positive in 1997, against a national average of
16.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey quoted a senior life insurance manager, Janina
Slawski, as saying that by 2010, South Africa's average life
expectancy could be reduced from 62 to 40 years.
</P>
<P>
She said when the epidemic peaked, between 2005 and 2010, an
estimated six million people would be HIV-positive, and 600,000
would have developed full-blown AIDS over that period.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reaction in Yugoslavia on Kosovo Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The agreement struck Tuesday
by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke on the Kosovo crisis has received mixed reaction in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from his final meeting with Holbrooke, Milosevic told
the nation in a televised address that the agreement removed the
threat of military intervention against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian government endorsed the agreement the same day at a
special cabinet session, saying it provided a basis for a lasting
political solution to the autonomy of Kosovo within Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Socialist Party of Serbia and the Yugoslav Left
hailed the agreement as "a victory of a principled and
well-founded policy" pursued by President Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
The deal averted a possible NATO air strike and protected the
country's territorial integrity and independence.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Kosovo provisional executive council Zoran
Andjelkovic said Wednesday in the Kosovo capital Pristina that the
council would fully comply with the agreement to reach a peaceful
resolution to the crisis in the southern Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news agency quoted Andjelkovic as
saying he was confident that "the majority of citizens -- ethnic
Albanians, Serbs and members of all other ethnic groups --
welcomed the agreement" which, he said, was in the interest of
peace and security in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Dragan Tomic, Serbia's parliament speaker, congratulated
Milosevic and said, "We are satisfied and happy that what we
wanted has been achieved... Sovereignty of the state, territorial
integrity and national dignity has been preserved."
</P>
<P>
But opposition parties, although supporting a peaceful
solution, criticized Milosevic for being irresponsible in the
negotiation that led to the agreement for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mission to be deployed
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"With bad leadership of the country, he (Milosevic) brought us
to the brink of war and was forced to give huge concessions," the
Democratic Party said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In Kosovo, the ethnic Albanians who are ready to die for the
independence of the province were against the agreement. They
still insisted on a full independence from Serbia or at least a
three-year transition that will allow them to have a full control
over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Veton Surroi, an editor of the ethnic Albanian newspaper Koha
Ditore, said, "The deal is not linked to a serious political
negotiating process. It reinforces Milosevic's authority on the
ground."
</P>
<P>
While in Belgrade, some people said Milosevic had saved the
nation's integrity and averted NATO air strikes while others
thought he had sold out the country, for with the agreement Kosovo
will eventually be governed by the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied with the agreement because I don't need to go
to Kosovo to fight for the integrity of Serbia," a student at
Belgrade University said.

<HEADLINE> Tang Shubei Urges End to Cross-Straits Hostilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Tang Shubei, executive vice
president of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Strait (ARATS), today called for an end of the state of
cross-Straits hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Tang stressed that ending hostilities is not only the will of
people on both sides of the Straits, but also represents their due
right.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the remarks during a press conference following a
meeting between ARATS President Wang Daohan and his Taiwan
counterpart Koo Chen-fu, chairman of the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF).
</P>
<P>
He said putting an end to cross-Straits hostilities is the
common aspiration of 1.2 billion Chinese citizens and compatriots
in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the direct cross-Straits mail, commercial
and transportation links, and said the indirect exchanges not only
harm the interests of Taiwan compatriots and but are also the root
cause of disputes.
</P>
<P>
Tang stressed that the Chinese mainland has consistently
attempted to maintain and guarantee the practical interests of
compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits. He said the
effort includes protecting the livelihood and property of three
million Taiwan compatriots who operate business ventures, as well
as those who visit friends or relatives, and others who purchase
homes on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Frequent personnel exchanges across the Taiwan Straits have
unfortunately resulted in inevitable incidents involving the
infringements on both the life and property of Taiwan compatriots,
said Tang.
</P>
<P>
He said that law enforcement departments on either side of the
Straits can readily solve related cases by improving security, and
noted that ARTS and SEF should expand cooperation in order to
provide mutual assistance when necessary.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that concerned departments on the mainland will
continue to attach great importance to matters involving the life
and property of Chinese citizens on both sides of the Straits.
</P>
<P>
ARATS will continue to offer all possible assistance to SEF in
order to maintain legitimate rights and interests of compatriots
on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, said Tang.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda Reiterate Joint Stance on DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Rwanda, who have
been accused by Congolese President Laurent Kabila of fomenting
and backing the armed rebellion in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC), have reaffirmed their stance on this ten-week-long
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors made a statement Wednesday evening after
Rwandan Vice-president Paul Kagame paid a one-day working visit
to Uganda, a press release from the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
During talks with President Yoweri Museveni, Kagame explained
his concern about the continuing insecurity in his country caused
by former Rwanda Armed Forces (ex-FAR) and Interahamwe militia
based in the DRC, as well as state-inspired acts of genocide and
ethnic cleaning of targeted groups of people in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Museveni reiterated that Uganda's military presence in eastern
part of the DRC is based on a mutually agreed arrangement between
the two governments and is aimed at flushing out Ugandan rebels
having rear bases there.
</P>
<P>
Both parties strongly condemned the involvement of the
terrorist regime of Sudan in the conflict and questioned the
wisdom of any continued support for the Kabila-Sudan alliance.
</P>
<P>
They also dismissed with contempt the "baseless" theories and
"falsehoods" propagated by Kabila and some of his allies to cover
up the real issues underlying the conflict.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that it was the two issues of supporting terrorist
groups and planning to commit genocide that had caused the two
countries to be in conflict with the Mobutu regime in 1996/1997.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two leaders also exchanged views on
issues concerning closer bilateral relations and how to
streamline methods of work to make cooperation in all fields more
co-ordinated.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Uganda will maintain its military
presence in eastern DRC until a government of the DRC accepted by
all the belligerent parties and opposition groups is in place or
the Organization of Africa Unity puts in place an alternative
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after the rebellion, foreign troops from Zimbabwe,
Angola, Namibia, Chad and Sudan were invited to fight for Kabila
government. Now there are more than 8,000 foreign troops fighting
alongside Kabila forces.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda strongly oppose foreign intervention in the
DRC crisis. The latest report said that the Tutsi rebels, who
have reportedly been supported by these two neighbors of DRC, had
retaken Kindu, a big city in eastern DRC which had been used by
government forces to fight rebels.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The International Fund for
Agricultural Development (IFAD) has decided to extend and double
fund for another four years to save Ugandan orphans.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Wednesday evening by the Ugandan
Presidential Office said the decision was made by IFAD President
Fawzi Al-Sultan when he paid a courtesy call on Ugandan First
Lady Janet Museveni here.
</P>
<P>
The IFAD president is on a five-day official visit to the east
African country.
</P>
<P>
IFAD acts as an intermediary for the administration of the
Belgian funding to Third World countries. Through IFAD, the
Belgians have funded the Uganda Women's Efforts to Save Orphans
(UWESO) to implement the UWESO Development Project for the last
four years.
</P>
<P>
The project has assisted rural women in Uganda who take care

<HEADLINE> ARATS, SEF Leaders Hold Candid Dialogue (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Wang Daohan, president of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait (ARATS), said
here today that the official end of the state of hostility across
the Taiwan Straits under the one-China principle is an essential
step for the further growth of the cross-straits relations.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that ending the state of hostility complies with the
interests of the people across the Taiwan Straits as well as
Taiwan compatriots' desire for stability and peace.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the remark during his meeting with Koo Chen-fu,
chairman of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF),
here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour meeting, they held a candid dialogue on a
series of questions across the straits including political issues
in a calm atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing after the meeting, Tang Shubei, executive
vice-president of the ARATS, said that Wang Daohan suggested
holding various dialogues between the ARATS and SEF for the
benefits of the peaceful reunification of China and the
development.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan side has some difficulties in holding talks on
procedural matters for political negotiation, the ARATS suggests
holding dialogues with the SEF, Wang said, adding that such
dialogues also include political ones, since it is difficult for
the two sides to shun political dialogue while holding dialogues.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion is positive as it has taken into account the
stance of both sides and it is aimed at promoting the relations
across the Straits, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wang went on to say that it has fully give expression to the
sincerity and efforts of the mainland for seeking common ground
while reserving differences and re-opening negotiations between
the two sides across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
He noted that promoting political negotiations across the Taiwan
Straits serves as a key to improving cross-Straits relations at
the current times.
</P>
<P>
"It is our persistent position that under the precondition of
one China, the two sides can hold talks on whatever
subjects. Mr. Jiang Zemin has proposed that the first step for the
two sides is to hold negotiations and reach consensus "under
one-China principle and formerly end the state of hostility across
the Taiwan Straits."
</P>
<P>
On this basis, Wang noted, the two sides jointly make
commitment to safeguarding the motherland's sovereignty and
territorial integrity as well as making plans for the development
of the relations across the Straits.

ATHENS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos met Wednesday with visiting U.S. mediator for the
Yugoslav issue Christopher Hill to discuss the situation in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their 50-minute meeting, Pangalos stressed that
the agreement reached between U.S. presidential envoy Richard
Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic created the
preconditions necessary to look for a peaceful and viable solution
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said that Greece would participate in the NATO military
force with the powers that would be requested of it to monitor the
implementation of the agreement for ending peacefully the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Hill said that the implementation of the agreement
would be watched closely and all sides should work very hard for
peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas Wednesday urged all sides involved in the Kosovo crisis to

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Says Openness Characterizes His Reign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Wednesday said that openness, freedom of the press, strengthening
democracy and supporting low-income people have always been the
key basis of his 17-year rule.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at an airbase west of Cairo, Mubarak said
that had it not been for the principle of openness, Egypt could
not have had got what it has now.
</P>
<P>
He said that some of his associates were of the view that he
should paint hope in his political speeches. "But I have kept
wondering how to give the people hope while the true picture was
bad. Had we painted to the people a beautiful picture they would
have blamed the state for embarking on reform or raising prices,"
said Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
For years, only the government, political parties and
government-approved companies had been allowed to run newspapers
in Egypt. But in 1996, as Egypt pushed to open its economy to
foreign investment, the government eased control and allowed
independent newspapers to publish.
</P>
<P>
That led to a boom, with 107 newspapers, most small and local,
hitting the stands. And some began to take up previously taboo
subjects such as government corruption and Muslim-Christian
tensions.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said Egypt maintains the freedom of the press, and the
public opinion has come to learn how to "differentiate between the
poor and good quality of things."
</P>
<P>
The president, who is also supreme commander of the Armed
Forces, made the remarks after inspecting the shooting ground of
the Air Force as part of the celebrations of the Air Forces Day
which fell on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has one year to go before his third-term six-year
presidency ends. He assumed the post in 1981 immediately after his
predecessor Anwar Sadat was assassinated.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has since started a vigorous economic reform program to
attract foreign investors and privatize state-owned
companies.

<HEADLINE> ARATS, SEF Leaders Hold Candid Dialogue (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wang said that at present preparations for political
negotiations across the straits and procedural arrangement for the
negotiations are expected to be made.
</P>
<P>
Through the talks on procedural matters, both sides can reach
consensus on the topics of the political talks, and under what
name and in what way the delegates are going to hold talks, he
said.
</P>
<P>
With this channel and mechanism, the Taiwan side can raise
other questions it is concerned with for further discussion, Wang
said.
</P>
<P>
He held that the talks between the ARATS and SEF should serve
to develop the relations across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Now the situation has undergone great changes and the talks
across the straits are expected to add new contents, he said.
</P>
<P>
What hindered the progress in the talks between the ARATS and
SEF in the past was attributed to the absence of conditions for
discussing such topics that involved political issues, he noted.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, he added, procedural topics cannot be
separated from political issues. It is unfavorable for the
settlement of issues and for the growth of relations across the
straits if talks on political issues are shunned or are limited to
practical issues. So political negotiations have objectively been
put on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Wang stressed that "the realization of the negotiations across
the straits will create still better conditions for providing the
settlement of economic issues between the two sides. I am willing
to reaffirm that after the talks on procedural matters of the
political negotiations begin, the ARATS and SEF can re-start their
talks on economic and practical issues."
</P>
<P>
Tang Shubei said that Koo Chen-fu also voiced his opinions on
holding dialogues or "constructive" dialogues across the straits.
</P>
<P>
Although they used somewhat different terms, they shared a view
on holding dialogues between the two sides including political
ones, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the meeting the two leaders also had a
frank exchange of ideas on some political issues including the
establishment of mutual trust and ending the state of hostility,
safeguarding the legal rights and interests of the compatriots
across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will meet again tomorrow to confer on the
issues of mutual interest and individual concern.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Giant Iceberg Born in Antarctica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have found a
giant iceberg which has broken off an Antarctic ice shelf.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) said that
they identified the iceberg, about 150 km by 30 km, Tuesday after
reviewing image collected by the U.S. NOAA weather satellite.
</P>
<P>
The iceberg, which has broken off Ronne Ice Shelf, in the
Weddell Sea, is four times the size of the last large iceberg to
calve in the region which came from Larsen Ice Shelf.
</P>
<P>
The break is a "normal event" in the Antarctic region and the
iceberg is probably the largest one discovered in the local region
in the past few years, Dr Lachlan-Cope, from the BAS's Cambridge
headquarters said Wednesday in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
The newly-born iceberg is grounded right now, Dr Lachlan-Cope
said, eventually it may drift into the south Atlantic in two or
three seasons and break up there in a very short time.
</P>
<P>
Ice shelves are found retreating on the Antarctic peninsula.
Researchers from the BAS predicted in 1996 that the region of
Ronne Ice Shelf was at risk and was likely to calve within a
decade.

<HEADLINE> China Against Proliferation of Mass Destruction Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China Wednesday
reiterated its position of supporting international efforts to
prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador for Disarmament Affairs Li Changhe told the First
Committee of the 53rd Session of the U.N. General Assembly that
China has improved its export control system through new
regulations.
</P>
<P>
As a state party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons, the Biological Weapons Convention and the
Chemical Weapons Convention, China has faithfully honored its
obligations and imposed strict control on the export of sensitive
items and their production technologies and equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the Chinese government has promulgated
the Regulations on the Supervision and Control of Chemicals, the
Regulations on Nuclear Export Control, and the Regulations on the
Control of the Export of Duel-Use Nuclear Materials and Related
Technology.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Li said, China applies strict control to the transfer
of conventional military equipment and related technologies, and
has issued the Regulations on the Control of the Export of
Military Products in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
and promoting international cooperation in the peaceful use of
sciences and technologies are just two sides of one coin," Li
said, noting that they should complement rather than exclude each
other.
</P>
<P>
The international non-proliferation efforts should be fair and
rational, and should not apply double standards whereby
non-proliferation is used as a pretext to infringe upon the
legitimate rights and interests of other nations, Li added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Mixed Tones on Coming U.S. Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Hours before Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leaves for Washington for talks with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, officials and parties here were
expressing various views on the U.S.-brokered summit.
</P>
<P>
While U.S. officials said it is time for a settlement over the
second Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, members of the
Israeli delegation were cautioning against pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
As hardliners stepped up pressure on Netanyahu not to make
concessions to the Palestinians, the main opposition Labor Party
declared that it will support Netanyahu if he reaches an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon stressed that people should not
expect quick results in the U.S. talks, saying although Israel
wants peace, the negotiations will take time. "It is not a short
procedure," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was echoed by Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky,
who, like Sharon, is also a member of Netanyahu's inner cabinet.
Sharansky described as "unhealthy" the great expectation for the
summit all over the world, saying it would result in pressure on
Israel.
</P>
<P>
"It's not our obligation to get back with an agreement. If we
are not able to get cooperation of the Palestinians on security
issues...there will be no agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Sharon and Sharansky will accompany Netanyahu to the
U.S. and take part in the negotiations, due to begin Thursday at
Wye Plantation near Washington and last into next week.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Israel, however, said
while the Clinton administration understands Israel's concerns
over the high expectation, it hopes the two sides will take "hard
decisions" in the talks in order to clinch a deal.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton is trying to persuade Netanyahu and
Arafat to conclude an agreement over a 13 percent Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank during the U.S. summit.
</P>
<P>
"We can't expect everything to be resolved in a short meeting,
but in the other hand, we can't expect the existing situation to
continue forever," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In the Knesset (parliament), nine lawmakers from the ruling
coalition signed a petition Wednesday to Netanyahu asking him not
to hand over land to the Palestinians unless they fulfill their
commitments under signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
This move added to the pressure already put on Netanyahu by his
right-wing partners.
</P>
<P>
The National Religious Party, the extreme rightist in the
coalition, has threatened to topple the government if Netanyahu
signs an agreement without meeting their conditions. The party
asked Netanyahu to make sure that the Palestinians extradite
suspects in attacks on Israelis and abolish the clauses in the
Palestinian Covenant calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Land of Israel Front, a group of rightist
legislators crossing party lines, has announced that from the
moment the government decides on withdrawal, it will take every
opportunity to bring down the government.
</P>
<P>
But Labor leader Ehud Barak promised Wednesday that Netanyahu
can count on the support of his party if he returns from
Washington with a redeployment deal.
</P>
<P>
The Labor party will provide Netanyahu with a "safety net" if
the Knesset turns a vote on the agreement to a no-confidence vote
on the government, although this does not mean the Labor supports
the policy of Netanyahu's government, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the Labor, which has 34 seats in the
Knesset, Netanyahu will be secured a parliamentary majority in the
120-seat parliament if he presents an agreement for
approval.

<HEADLINE> China for Landmine Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- China said Wednesday
that it is in favor of imposing proper and reasonable control on
landmines to protect innocent civilians from injuries by these
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador for Disarmament Affairs Li Changhe told a U.N.
session here that the most pressing issue at present is to assist
mine-affected countries to remove remaining mines that still
threaten civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that President Jiang Zemin declared during his
visit to Canada last November that China will actively participate
in international mine clearance efforts.
</P>
<P>
Despite additional spending on flood fighting and disaster
relief this year, China still decides to contribute 100,000 U.S.
dollars to the U.N. Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine
Clearance, which will be earmarked for demining activities in
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with relevant U.N. departments, China will host
two training courses on mine clearance in the next two years when
Chinese experts will provide technical training to students from
mine-affected countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will also provide mine-detection and mine-clearance
equipment to those countries, Li added.
</P>
<P>
He told the session that China ratified the amended Landmine
Protocol and the newly annexed Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons
to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons on 29 August
1998.
</P>
<P>
"China will formally deposit its instruments of ratification of
the above-mentioned two protocols with the secretary-general of
the United Nations," Ambassador Li declared.

<HEADLINE> Ambassador: U.S. Investors Have Growing Interest in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Daniel
Kurtzer said Wednesday the American companies and investors have
a growing interest in employing their funds in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a joint news conference here with the
director of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)
Joseph Grandmaison.
</P>
<P>
Referring to related American studies, the ambassador said the
findings show that Egypt is increasingly attracting American
investments as its economy keeps improving.
</P>
<P>
He estimated American investments in Egypt at 2.2 billion dollars,
maintaining that expectations are high that the investments volume
will jump to a worth of 3 billion dollars in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Within this framework, five American companies had sent
delegations to see the possibility of launching projects in Toshka
in Upper Egypt, an area which is witnessing implementation of a
giant Egyptian development project.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of American companies operation in Egypt
increased from 220 to 229 in the past nine months only.
</P>
<P>
The director of the USAID, at the news conference, said up to
52 investment projects at a worth of 10 billion dollars were
submitted for study for the Egyptian and American investors
participating in a conference which opened earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which followed a U.S. government decision to
cut economic assistance to Egypt, is designed to encourage
American private sector to increase investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
U.S. assistance to Egypt and Israel will be reduced by five
percent as of 1999. The drop in the annual U.S. aid to Egypt
from 815 million dollars to 775 million dollars is a move the
U.S. Congress is undertaking in view of skinny U.S. budget
resources.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. foreign aid budget has been including 815 million
dollars for Cairo, and 1.2 billion for Tel Aviv, in addition to
the aid earmarked for international organizations. Cairo also gets
an 1.3 billion dollars in military aid from Washington every year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the U.S. have hold an array of talks in both Cairo
and Washington since July on establishing a new system of
cooperation that puts emphasis on enhancing economic and trade
cooperation and rescheduling the aid program.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Pledges to Comply with Arbitration Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean President Issayas
Aferwerki has reiterated that Asmara will comply with the results
of the international arbitration over its disputed Red Sea islands
with Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Aferwerki expressed the stance in a message to Yemeni President
Ali Abdullah Saleh, the Yemeni News Agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The message was conveyed to Saleh Wednesday by visiting
Eritrean Minister of Trade and Industry Ali Sayed and Minister of
Foreign Affairs Wald Telmisani.
</P>
<P>
Yemen clashed with Eritrea in December 1995 when Eritrean
troops took over most of the Red Sea Hanish Archipegalo. In May
1996, Eritrea accepted a France-brokered accord to seek
international arbitration on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, both sides said that they accepted the decision of
a London-based International Arbitration Panel, which awarded the
bulk of the islands to Yemen.
</P>
<P>
In the message, Aferwerki voiced keenness on establishing
close, cooperative ties of good neighborliness with Yemen that not
only benefit the two countries but also regional peace, security
and stability.
</P>
<P>
Aferwerki also invited Saleh to visit Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Saleh echoed Aferwerki's words in his meeting
with Eritrean officials, saying Yemen is willing to open a new
page in relationship with Eritrea for a more prosperous future.
</P>
<P>
Saleh expressed thanks for Aferwerki's invitation, saying he
will visit Eritrea at an appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
Aferwerki met a high-ranking Yemeni delegation led by Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Abdel-Kadir Bagmal Tuesday.
This was the first visit by a ministerial Yemeni official since
December l995.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the two countries are taking concrete steps
to improve bilateral relations, such as resuming their diplomatic
ties to the ambassadorial level and reopen air link.

<P>
MOSCOW, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
welcomed the current turn in the Kosovo event, Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said Wednesday after meeting with the president
in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Primakov told reporters that Yeltsin praised the civil action
of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
in Kosovo and instructed Russian officials to continue working in
the same direction.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia's position is effective now and lessening
tension around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the stand taken by Russia in the settlement of the
Iraqi crisis and during the developments in Kosovo, Primakov said,
"We have stated point-blank that if an air strike is dealt at
Yugoslavia, our attitude to NATO will be dramatically changed, and
there will be many changes in our orientation."
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that he also reported to the president the main
issues of the government's performance.
</P>
<P>
The president paid special attention to the fulfillment by the
government of its obligations concerning the current payouts to
public-sector workers, the army, and pensioners, according to
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the health of Yeltsin, Primakov said, "The
president feels well." He "waved aside our remarks when we
reminded him of the need of stay in bed and have a thorough rest,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Yeltsin was also attended by Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov, who has now left for Paris to attend a session of the
Contact Group on Yugoslavia, and Defense Minister Igor Sergiyev.

<HEADLINE> General Assembly Urges U.S. to End Embargo Against Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The 53rd General
Assembly (GA) session Wednesday voted 157-2 to adopt a resolution
calling for an end to Washington's nearly four-decade economic
embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Israel voted against the resolution, with
12 countries abstaining.
</P>
<P>
The resolution reiterated its call for all nations to "refrain
from promulgating and applying laws and measures" on the embargo
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The resolution once again urged "states that have and continue
to apply such laws and measures to take the necessary steps to
repeal or invalidate them as soon as possible in accordance with
their legal regime."
</P>
<P>
The resolution requested the U.N. secretary-general, in
consultation with the appropriate organs and agencies of the
United Nations system, to prepare a report on the implementation
of the present resolution in the light of the purposes and
principles of the U.N. Charter and international law, and to
submit it to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session.
</P>
<P>
The resolution voiced the GA decision to include in the
provisional agenda of its fifty-fourth session in the item
entitled "Necessity of ending economic, commercial and financial
embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba."
</P>
<P>
Before voting, the Cuban foreign minister took the floor at the
plenary meeting of the 53rd GA session.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly has made the embargo-ending appeal for
seven years in a row, but Washington, citing Cuba's alleged
violation of human rights, insisted on maintaining the embargo.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM leaves for Paris Contact Group Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov left for Paris Wednesday to attend a meeting of the Contact
Group on the Kosovo crisis, according to the Itar-Tass news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The meeting attended by the foreign ministers of the six-nation
Contact Group, the United States, Britain, Italy, France, Germany
and Russia, will hear U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke's
report on the results of his talks with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and a report by Polish Foreign Minister
Bronislaw Geremek, who is now the chairman in office of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
The ministers are expected to discuss the details of the
agreement on Kosovo reached by Holbrooke and Milosevic, the
implementation of the agreement and the role to be played in this
process by the United Nations, the OSCE and NATO.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that one of the main goals of the meeting is to
work out a mechanism of "verification and control" over the
implementation of the Kosovo accords.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure to Paris, Ivanov told reporters that
President Boris Yeltsin insists that Russian diplomats remain
vigilant and keep all attention on Kosovo because "there are signs
of a positive turn towards political settlement."
</P>
<P>
However, the president noted, the ultimate threat of combat
operation is still there. "Therefore, our task is to firm up this
positive trend and make sure that the political dialogue
continues," Invav quoted Yeltsin as saying.

<HEADLINE> House Panel May Streamline Impeachment Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The chairman of the
Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives said
Thursday that he will try to streamline the panel's impeachment
inquiry by focusing on the "core charges" against President Bill
Clinton: lying under oath, obstruction of justice and witness
tampering.
</P>
<P>
Representative Henry Hyde, a Republican, said his goal is to
finish the inquiry by the end of the year -- a goal he has
expressed before, even while opposing Democratic attempts to set
strict time limits on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The White House suggested Hyde is floating a trial balloon for
political reasons.
</P>
<P>
The House voted 258-176 last week to authorize the inquiry
without limits by time or subject.
</P>
<P>
"The committee is attempting in this initial phase of the
impeachment inquiry to establish a process for completing the
inquiry by the end of the year," Hyde said Thursday in a written
statement. "This requires streamlining its work to focus on the
core charges against the president of lying under oath,
obstruction of justice and witness tampering."
</P>
<P>
But Hyde said the year-end goal could not be met without
cooperation from the White House and committee Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the chairman said in an interview with The Washington
Post Tuesday that the 15 potential grounds for impeachment --
detailed by the committee's chief investigator last week -- may be
pared down to meet the voluntary deadline.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Thursday,
"Expansion of charges last week probably was done with politics in
mind on the House floor. And floating the idea of reducing them
probably has something to do with politics this week."
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said any serious process must first look at setting
the standards of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
David P. Schippers, the Judiciary Committee's chief counsel,
outlined the 15 separate allegations last week, adopting 10 of the
11 grounds for impeachment recommended by Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr and offering four from the panel's Republican staff
for the committee to consider.

<HEADLINE> SPD, Greens Agree to Liberalize German Citizenship Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Chancellor-elect Gerhard
Schroeder's Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Greens party
agreed Wednesday to liberalize Germany's citizenship law to make
it easier for the nation's 7 million foreigners to integrate into
German society.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached between the SPD and Greens would allow
third-generation foreigners who are born here to get German
passports automatically while keeping the nationality of their
parents at the same time.
</P>
<P>
In addition, foreign immigrants would be able to apply for
German citizenship after eight years instead of the current 15
years of waiting period.
</P>
<P>
Kerstin Mueller, a Greens leader, described the accord as a
clear signal for earlier integration of foreigners living in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The children of immigrants from Turkey, Yugoslavia, Italy and
Greece who began arriving in the 1950s during the post-war
economic boom have largely transformed Germany into a
multicultural society in recent years.
</P>
<P>
There are currently about 7.4 million foreigners living in
Germany out of a total population of 82 million, more than any
other European nation.
</P>
<P>
The conservative party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who was
defeated by Schroeder's SPD in general elections on September 27,
has so far resisted efforts to alter the citizenship law dating
back to a 1913 imperial edict that bases nationality on bloodlines
rather than birthplace.
</P>
<P>
Both the SPD and Greens believe that loosening the citizenship
law would help ease social tensions given the booming foreign
population.
</P>
<P>
The two parties are currently in negotiations to form a
center-left coalition government in Bonn. If a deal could be
reached, the new government is due to be sworn in at the end of
October.

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Work Resumes in Kosovo After Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- International aid agencies
began massive relief efforts to save the lives of tens of
thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees in Kosovo, according to
reports from the Kosovo capital of Pristina Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move came just hours after Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke struck a deal
to end Serbian military action in Kosovo and allow refugees to
return home.
</P>
<P>
Fernando Del Mundo, spokesman for the UNHCR, said, "Time is
running out for us, but some ethnic Albanian refugees are too
scared to come out of forests and into towns."
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 ethnic Albanians have left their homes since the
conflict flared up in March in Kosovo between Serb forces and the
Kosovo Liberation Army. Humanitarian work was severely hindered by
the seven-month-long conflict.
</P>
<P>
"It's crucial that we're able to help them. People are still
out in the open without proper clothes, some of them barefoot,"
Mundo said, adding the relief work became urgent as winter
approaches.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the European Union's special envoy to
Kosovo, Wolfgang Petrisch, met Ibrahim Rugova, leader of the
Kosovo Albanians, and urged him to support the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"This is a big chance for the Kosovo Albanian side and they
should take this up," Petrisch said after talks with Rugova in
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
Petrisch was the first senior Western official to meet the
Albanian leadership since Tuesday's breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman of the U.N. Liaison Office in Belgrade
said Wednesday that to follow closely the agreement, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan would send a mission to Yugoslavia in
the next few days for further discussion on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Jay Carter told a press conference in Belgrade that
the agreement reached Tuesday would mean much for a peaceful
solution to the problems in Kosovo, and would contribute to a
better future for Yugoslavia.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Sit-in Staged to Urge Release of Jordanians Jailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Jordanians staged a
sit-in outside the Parliament Wednesday to press for the release
of Jordanian prisoners held in Syria.
</P>
<P>
The sit-inners, most of them relatives of the prisoners, urged
the government, lawmakers and human rights organizations,
especially the Amnesty International, to work for the quick
release of the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Emad Sharqawi, one of the sit-in organizers, said that
700-1,000 Jordanians are in jails in Syria, and most of them were
imprisoned without trials and ill-treated, the semi-official
Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, representatives from the demonstrators submitted a
memorandum to the Lower House of Parliament, containing the list
of the Jordanian inmates and describing the adverse conditions
they are facing in Syrian prisons.
</P>
<P>
In response, some lawmakers said that the issue has been top on
the agenda of the House and its affiliated Committee of Public
Freedom is making efforts to secure the release of the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Sharqawi said another two sit-ins will be held near the Prime
Minister's Office and the Syrian Embassy respectively later if the
current one achieves no success.
</P>
<P>
Sharqawi said that many of Jordanians have been detained since
1970s on charges with having links with Palestinian organizations
or Jordan's major opposition the Muslim Brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
And some others were members of the National Command of the
ruling Baath Party in Syria, who were put into prisons following
the coup in 1971 which brought the incumbent Hafez Assad to power.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the Amnesty International said that most of
the Jordanian prisoners were jailed without trials and some of them
are in poor health and suffering from diseases.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Information Nasir Judeh Tuesday said that
the government is making efforts to secure the release of the
Jordanian prisoners in Syria.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Monitors See Some Compliance in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- International monitoring
teams in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo Wednesday saw signs that
Serbian forces are starting to comply with U.N. demands, the State
Department said.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said two U.S. teams and
one European team went into the Kosovo countryside Wednesday to
see what was happening on the ground.
</P>
<P>
"They encountered no denial of access. They regarded the access
as excellent, the Serb police presence is much smaller in the
countryside than on Sunday, and the Serb police are generally
departing the countryside," he told a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The monitors reported that many checkpoints have gone and there
are signs of people returning to villages on the east-west highway
south of Malisevo, once an Albanian separatist stronghold, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the local Kosovars that they met with indicated that
they were pleased with the changed circumstances in which they
were going to be provided greater security through this agreement
and its verification system," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. spokesman said these were only preliminary
impressions and agreements were still needed on aerial monitoring
and on a 2,000-strong ground monitoring force.
</P>
<P>
"NATO authorities will have to make a judgment at the end of
the week whether there is substantial and serious compliance on
the part of President Milosevic," he said.
</P>
<P>
The current monitors are part of a diplomatic observer mission
and Rubin said he expected this to evolve into the 2,000-strong
mission which Milosevic negotiated with U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke Monday.
</P>
<P>
The full-scale mission will be under the auspices of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which
is chaired by Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek.
</P>
<P>
"As Foreign Minister Geremek gets approval from his governing
board in Vienna to launch this, contributions need to be obtained.
A headquarters needs to be set up in Pristina. A leader and chief
of the mission needs to be selected. I would expect that to take
some time," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"The key to this agreement, if it's going to work, is going to
be the on-site verification system on the ground and the aerial
verification system in the air that we are trying very hard to
stand up in the coming days," said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said he expected Serbia would sign an agreement with NATO
to implement the aerial verification system, and an agreement with
the OSCE to implement the ground verification system.
</P>
<P>
"So this combined air-ground verification system will give us
greater and greater confidence of the kind of preliminary
indications that I just gave you," the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> EU to Lift Sanctions on Nigeria Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
assured Nigeria that it will lift virtually all sanctions on the
west African country soon, a press release from the presidency in
Abuja said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, visiting Spanish Secretary of State
for European Union and External Affairs, Ramon de Miguel, made
the assurance while meeting with Nigerian leader General
Abdulsalami Abubakar Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The release did not mention any specific date when the
sanctions will be lifted, but the official News Agency of Nigeria
(NAN) quoted de Miguel as saying after the meeting that the date
would be on October 26.
</P>
<P>
NAN also quoted the minister as saying that the EU convened on
the issue in Brussels Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
De Miguel told Abubakar that the EU will lift all sanctions on
Nigeria after the forthcoming review except the arms embargo and
ban on military training, the presidency said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said military training which would enhance
Nigeria's capability to engage in humanitarian operations might
be allowed pending the lift of the arms embargo and restrictions
on military relations.
</P>
<P>
The total lift of the sanctions will be after the successful
conclusion of the transition program which is scheduled to end in
May next year, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
De Miguel commended the efforts of the Abubakar government to
entrench democracy and liberalize the political and economic
environment in Nigeria, saying that Spain and the EU would do
their best to support the on-going regeneration process in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Responding, General Abubakar thanked de Miguel for his visit
and assured him that the transition program was very much on
course and that his government was taking steps to address all
identified problems which might hinder its successful
implementation.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said his government welcomed offers by friendly
nations to help in ensuring the success of its political program
and expressed the hope that more Spanish investors will seize
the opportunity of the on-going privatization exercise to come to
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The EU and other Western countries imposed wide sanctions on
Nigeria in 1995 after the then government of late General Sani
Abacha hanged author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority
activists on murder charges.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's relations with the West have improved greatly after
Abubakar took office in June following the sudden death of
Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar has won wide support both at home and abroad for his
aggressive measures in promoting democratization and economic
reform, including the release of all political detainees,
announcement of a new democratization program and massive
privatization of badly-run public enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Good Prospects for Cyprus Economy: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Prospects for Cyprus' economy
are encouraging despite the turmoil in the global economy, Finance
Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the annual meeting of the island's stock brokers,
Christodoulou said economic growth rate this year would reach 4.5
percent, compared with 2.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, unemployment rate would be around 3 percent
and inflation would fall to 2.5 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to government's policies, Christodoulou said the
liberalization and modernization of the financial system and the
capital market was one of its top priorities.
</P>
<P>
He spoke highly of the progress of the Cyprus Stock Exchange
(CSE) and the incentives the government introduced to help boost
the island's stock market.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the government and stockbrokers was
"valuable," he said, it "is perhaps the best example of harmonious
cooperation between the public and private sectors."
</P>
<P>
He said the incentives have already delivered, because a number
of companies are seeking listing in the CSE.
</P>
<P>
In January, Cypriot government announced a series of incentives
to boost the stock market, including allowing offshore companies
to invest in listed companies' stocks without lossing their
special tax status, 50-percent cut of tax rate of companies which
seek listing within the coming five years, and exemption of the
cost of acquisition of new-listed shares from tax for four years
instead of two years.
</P>
<P>
The CSE was launched in March 1996 after years of operation in
an unofficial capacity under the auspices of the Cyprus Chamber of
Commerce and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Its total market capitalization reached 1.83 billion Cyprus
pounds (about 3.66 billion U.S. dollars) in June this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Up 0.3 Pct in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. retail sales moved
up by a modest 0.3 percent in September thanks to a rebound in
auto sales, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Overall, sales rose to a seasonally adjusted 224.9 billion U.S.
dollars after flat sales in August, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
Auto sales shot up 0.9 percent in September, the best gain in
four months, following decreases of 0.1 percent in August and 4.3
percent in July.
</P>
<P>
However, excluding autos, sales inched up just 0.1 percent
higher in September, the same as the increase in the month before.
</P>
<P>
The report suggests consumers may have turned a bit cautious
following the sharp late-August drop in the stock market. Besides,
analysts believed, Hurricane Georges temporarily battered sales in
parts of the South and unseasonable warmth curbed spending on fall
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
Sales at clothing and accessory stores dropped 1.3 percent, the
worst decline in a year and a half. Spending at furniture stores
edged down by 0.2 percent, the weakest performance in five months.
</P>
<P>
Due to falling gasoline prices, sales at service stations
decreased 0.8 percent. For the third quarter, they're off 5.7
percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Drugstore sales were down 0.1 percent in September. On the
positive side, spending increased 0.7 percent at department stores
and other general merchandisers, 0.8 percent at restaurants and
bars, 0.4 percent at building-supply and hardware stores and 0.3
percent at food stores.
</P>
<P>
A boom in home sales, fueled by low mortgage rates, has
supported sales of building materials and hardware. The
third-quarter sales level was 9.7 percent higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
Overall, retail sales, which account for roughly a third of the
nation's economic output, were 4.1 percent higher in the third
quarter than a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Trade Ties With Asia Must Be Reviewed: Mozambican </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Minister of Planning
and Finance Tomaz Salomao said here Wednesday that Mozambique
must review its trade ties with the Asian countries in serious
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government must evaluate its relations with
those countries inflicted by serious financial turmoil, the Asian
countries in particular, so as to defuse the negative influence
of the crisis, Salomao said at a press conference in Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that with right evaluation of the trade
ties, the Mozambican government may take realistic measures to
keep away from the Asian flu.
</P>
<P>
However, Salomao noted that the efforts made by Mozambique
should be concerted with those by the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) members.
</P>
<P>
He added that "collective action" can help SADC member states
to avoid the Asian financial crisis which has influenced many
markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican finance minister stressed that his government
would keep up its efforts to curb the inflation.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government is aiming to keep the inflation
within 10 percent in 1998, said Salomao.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's inflation rate was 17 percent in 1996 and 5.6
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Influenced by the overwhelming financial crisis in Asia,
Mozambique is facing great pressure in curbing the inflation.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Link Infertility to Bacterial Infection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Some men may have low fertility
because of bacterial infections in their sperm, researchers in
Hungary said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bela Molnar and colleagues of Albert Szent-Gysrgyi Medical
University in Szeged, Hungary, reported in the New Scientist
magazine that they have shown bacteria can prevent sperm from
swimming well enough to reach an egg.
</P>
<P>
The reproductive systems of up to two-thirds of men are
infected with anaerobic bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum
and Bacteroides fragilis.
</P>
<P>
These infections usually go unnoticed unless extremely large
numbers of the bacteria are present, when they can cause pain and
discharge.
</P>
<P>
Wondering if these bacteria could be one factor in some men's
fertility problems, the researchers isolated F. nucleatum and B.
fragilis from 43 infected men and incubated sperm of normal
motility with various concentrations of the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Sperm usually swim in a culture medium for a day or more. But
even in the samples with low concentrations of bacteria, only 1
percent of the sperm were still moving after 18 hours. At the
highest dose, they all stopped moving after three hours.
</P>
<P>
Bacteria may inhibit sperm motility by either competing for
fructose, a sugar that sperm need for energy or producing products
that are toxic to sperm, or physically interfering with the
lashing of sperm tails, explained the researchers.
</P>
<P>
The study suggested that infertile men with infections should
be given broad-spectrum antibiotics for three months to eliminate
the bacteria, before beginning In Vitro Fertilization (IVF).
</P>
<P>
"We should first treat them and let them try to conceive the
normal way," Molnar said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Adopts Document on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma, the
lower house of parliament, Wednesday passed a statement on the
situation in the Balkans, which welcomes "the progress on a
peaceful resolution to the conflict in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, the document endorsed by
307 votes with six votes against said that the State Duma
unconditionally denounces any forms of aggression against the
Union Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It declared that in the event of unleashing military operations
by NATO member states against that country, considerable damage
will be caused to their relations with Russia, which will flare up
tension in Europe and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Praising Russian diplomats for the international efforts to
settle the Kosovo problem, the Duma stressed, "NATO's decision to
implement a military action against Yugoslavia should be abolished
immediately."
</P>
<P>
The State Duma sent its delegation to Belgrade Wednesday to
coordinate the position of the conflicting sides. Yugoslavia
should also develop links with the Russia-Belarus Union, the Duma
said.
</P>
<P>
The Duma also recommended that the Russian government "correct
the program for cooperation between Russia and NATO, while taking
into account NATO's position in Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to continue to make energetic efforts for
reaching a compromise on the Kosovo problem, the lower house
believed. Such a compromise may be based on an end to violence,
implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and the start
of constructive talks on the status of Kosovo with respect for the
territorial integrity of the Union Republic of Yugoslavia, it
said.

<P>
CAIRO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Firms of the United States and France are competing
over a gas pipeline project that would carry Syrian gas to
Lebanon, the Arabic daily An Nahar reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said Elf-Aquitain of France has gone a long way in
its negotiations with the Lebanese government and the Ministry of
Electricity on the project, details of which have not been
disclosed yet.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the report quoted the director of the
U.S. Trade and Development Agency Joseph Grandmaison, who has
been visiting here, as saying that his agency had approved a
500,000 U.S. dollars allocation for a feasibility study on the
project.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the party who offers to do a feasibility study
has a better chance of winning the project.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Lebanese cabinet has endorsed the launch of a new
550 million-U.S. dollar bond issue, local newspapers reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move came only two days after a 100 million-dollar
Eurobonds was launched in London.
</P>
<P>
The 550-million-dollar bond issue will be the last in a plan
approved by the parliament early this year to borrow 2 billion
dollars to restructure part of the country's national debt of 14
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- A total of 76.1 percent of the Royal Jordanian (RJ)
flights started out and arrived safely as they were scheduled in
the first nine months of this year, compared with 75.5 percent in
the same period in 1997, Jordan's official news agency Petra said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the news agency reported that the RJ flights carried
911,975 passengers in the first nine months of this year,
making the occupancy rate of the RJ flights' seats reaching 65.7
percent.
</P>

</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Amman Financial Market (AFM), Jordan's sole stock
market, Wednesday suspended trading the shares of the Jordan
Cement Factories Company (JCFC) in preparation for privatizing the
state-owned company.
</P>
<P>
The suspension will keep valid until a formal governmental
decision about the privatization of the JCFC is made, said a
AFM statement.
</P>
<P>
The government now owns 49.3 percent of the kingdom's sole
cement producer's shares. The JCFC earned some 17 million
U.S. dollars in net profits in 1997.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- French travel agents and tour operators said here
Wednesday that the number of French tourists coming to Jordan can
reach 60,000 this year, if promotion efforts and regular flight
operation between the two countries are increased.
</P>
<P>
Jordan received a total of 30,000 French tourists in 1997,
Jordan's official news agency Petra quoted the agents and
operators as saying at a meeting held between the two sides'
tourism officials and representatives in Amman.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will hold preliminary talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat at the White
House on Thursday to start the Middle East summit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's meeting with the two leaders will be followed by a
Rose Garden appearance by all three at which Clinton will outline
the objectives of the summit, said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Arafat will then leave for the Wye Plantation on
Maryland's Eastern Shore with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright to begin the summit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will go to there at mid-afternoon to open the plenary
session between all three delegations, and wrap up the day at a
joint dinner there with Netanyahu and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will travel for Democratic fund-raising in Chicago and
St. Louis on Friday but will be available for help on Saturday and
Sunday if needed.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart cautioned reporters against expecting a "substantive,
play-by-play" account of the summit while it is privately going
on.
</P>
<P>
"We do not intend to have these discussions played out in the
papers or on TV. So as an early warning, the talks will remain
among the parties for the time that they are there and when it's
appropriate we'll let you know what we can," he said.

<HEADLINE> Blood Donation May Lower Risk of Heart Attack: Magazine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Blood donors may have a lower
risk of heart attacks than those who chose not to give blood,
Finnish scientists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The finding supports the hypothesis that people with more iron
in their bodies are at greater risk of heart attacks, Dr Jukka
Salonen, of the University of Kuopio, Finland, reported in the New
Scientist.
</P>
<P>
"We were extremely surprised to find such a strong relationship
between blood donation and protection against heart disease," Dr
Jukka Salonen told the magazine.
</P>
<P>
After studying the medical records of 2,862 men over a
nine-year period, the researcher found that of the 153 who were
blood donors, only one suffered a heart attack, while among the
non-donors the heart attack rate was 17 times higher.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believed that the reduction in heart disease may be
due to the loss of iron associated with blood donation.
</P>
<P>
An earlier study by the same group found that men with large
iron stores in the body were more than twice likely to have a
heart attack than those whose iron stores were low.

<HEADLINE> S. African Central Bank Lowers Repo Rate </HEADLINE>

JOHANNESBURG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- As a sign of an easing in
monetary policy, South African Reserve Bank Wednesday lowered its
repo rate by 0.25 percentage points to 21.60 percent, South
African television reported.
</P>
<P>
Business welcomed the small step taken by the reserve bank,
the central bank of South Africa, but said that it was too early
to be optimistic in view of the fact that the world financial
market is still highly volatile.
</P>
<P>
The repo rate, at which the central bank lends to commercial
banks, had been stuck at high levels after the financial crisis
began in late May this year.
</P>
<P>
The repo rate was below 15 percent before the crisis, said the
report.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Conflicting Parties Begin Face-to-Face </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Conflicting factions in
the Burundi peace talks opened their face-to-face discussions
Wednesday after more than two months of recess with a debate on
the issue of democracy and good governance.
</P>
<P>
An aide to peace talks mediator Julius Nyerere, the former
president of Tanzania, said that the talks started in a friendly
atmosphere with all parties showing concern for a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The issue of democracy and governance is the first item on the
five-point agenda adopted late on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The other items on the agenda are endorsement of chairmen of
five committees proposed at the first round of talks in June this
year, start of the work of the committees, discussions of
procedures governing talks and debate on subject of peace and
security in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The aide said four sides -- the National Assembly, Frolina,
Inkinzo and the former Burundian president Ntibuntanganya -- have
represented their views at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks, which started on Tuesday, are aimed
at ending the five-year civil strife in the land-locked Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports reaching here said Nyerere attended a short
service in remembrance of Prince Louis Rwegasore on Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere praised the late prince, saying they had close contact
particularly during the independence struggles.
</P>
<P>
"If Prince Rwegasore has to rise from his tomb today, he'll be
shocked to see how tiny African republic has been divided on
ethnic lines," he told more than 40 Burundians who gathered at
the service at the Hotel 77 in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Among the audience was the former President of Burundi,
Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, who was overthrown in 1993 by military
strongman Major Pierre Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
He urged Burundians to follow footsteps of the late prince who
had united the nation to bring prosperity and development for
all.
</P>
<P>
The remembrance service was organized by the government of
Buyoya, led by Burundi's Minister of Peace Process, Ambroise
Niyonsaba.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere said the lifting of economic embargo on Burundi by
Great Lakes states lies in the hands of Burundians themselves.
</P>
<P>
If various Burundian factions can agree on a peace deal, a
message will be delivered to leaders of the Great Lakes countries
so that they could lift the sanctions in a short time, he said.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned the warring parties not to deploy any dilatory
tactics in the peace process, otherwise the Great Lakes states
will play the same game.
</P>
<P>
East and central African nations, backed by the Organization
of African Unity, have imposed economic sanctions on Burundi
shortly after Buyoya toppled a civilian government led by
President Ntibantunganya in July of 1996.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed
in Burundi since October 1993 in a series of massacres and in
armed conflict between Tutsis and Hutus.
</P>
<P>
Warring parties signed a ceasefire agreement in the first
round of talks in June and dwelt mainly on the genesis of the
Burundi conflict at the second round of talks in July. But
fightings have continued over the past months.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Sustain Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets, buoyed
by Wall Street's bounce back into positive territory, enjoyed an
end of session rally on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index staged a modest comeback despite a
morning in the doldrums, as index of top shares ended the day up
48.3 points at 5038.4, making up for Tuesday's 47.5 drop which
followed Monday's record gains. But at one point earlier it had
been down 54.4 at 4935.7.
</P>
<P>
The gains in London came even though Wall Street opened down
while in the morning dealers had bad news from the Far East to
contend with. In Japan the Nikkei was down 172.06 at 13070.73 and
in Hong Kong the Hang Seng slipped back 18.74 at 8990.09.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for interest rates remained mixed as unemployment
figures showed the claimant count at an 18 year low, while the
annual rise in average earnings fell back to 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, minutes from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy
Committee meeting showed hardline interest rate hawk Willem Buiter
switched his vote in September to back a cut for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The news had little effect on the markets, with analysts split
as to whether the inflationary implications of the jobless fall
outweighed the other indicators.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the Dax index rallied strong towards the end of
trade, closing at 4371 points after a gain of 117.98. But
investors said that trade had remained subdued.
</P>
<P>
Achim Matzke at Commerzbank said the dollar's drop overnight
may have been keeping investors out of the market. The dollar
slipped to DM1.6336 from DM1.6522 late Tuesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the Cac 40 index closed at its session high, boosted
by Wall Street's late morning recovery, closing at 3,361, after a
gain of 82.19. Traders said it was underpinned both by the
greenback's turnaround and the boost in European markets.
</P>
<P>
"That's unusual, but it's symptomatic of the fact that European
markets have been underperforming," said one dealer. "There's hope
of stability in Europe next year; the U.S. will go into recession
before we will, which will create demand for European equities."
</P>
<P>
But he warned that CAC-40 trading volume would remain modest in
coming sessions with investors still cautious because of the
dollar's relative weakness.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Right-Wingers Rally against Possible Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Israelis took to
the street Wednesday to protest against signing an agreement with
the Palestinians over the second redeployment of Israeli troops in
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The rally, organized by the right-wingers, was held near the
residence of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister, stop the danger, don't surrender," says a
giant sign, giving the rally its theme.
</P>
<P>
Demonstrators also held posters reading: "Agreement on
withdrawal bad for Israel" and "Benjamin Netanyahu, you was wrong
on signing Hebron Accord, don't continue on singing agreements."
</P>
<P>
Hanan Porat, Knesset (parliament) member of the National
Religious Party, said in the rally that a withdrawal agreement
means Israel would hand over territory to the Palestinians in a
"silver plate."
</P>
<P>
He threatened that he will call for early elections if an
agreement is reached without the fulfillment of the Palestinian
commitments to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is due to fly to the United States Wednesday night
and take part in a three-way meeting with Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and the U.S. President Bill
Clinton to break the deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. peace initiative calls on Israel to hand over 13 percent
more of the West Bank in the second redeployment in exchange for
Palestinian crackdown on terrorism. Israel has so far balked at
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Israeli right-wing parties claimed this scope of would endanger
the security interests of the Jewish country, and threatened to
topple the government if Netanyahu agrees to cede that much.

<HEADLINE> No Meeting Planned between Turkish-Syrian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry said
Wednesday that no meeting had been planned between Turkish Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem and his Syrian counterpart Farouq al Sharaa on
the tense bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Sermet Atacanli, deputy spokesman of Turkish Foreign Ministry,
told a weekly press conference that there is no plan of such
meeting, and if there is one, terrorism issue will be the only
topic to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed earlier press reports that Cem would be
visiting some Arab nations soon regarding the current Turkish-Syrian
tension.
</P>
<P>
On the reports that Abdullah Ocalan, leader of Turkey's
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), has left Syria, the
spokesman said, "it has to be confirmed."
</P>
<P>
"We need confirmation on whether or not Ocalan is out of
Syria," Atacanli said.
</P>
<P>
There are reports that Ocalan has left Syria which Turkey
accuses of supporting the Kurdish rebels fighting against the
Turkish government in southeastern Turkey, amid recent
Turco-Syrian tension.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a Kuwaiti daily, Syrian Information
Minister Mohammad Salman even said that the PKK leader had not
been in Syria for the past three months.
</P>
<P>
"If Syria really wishes to end the tension or prevent that
tension from taking different dimensions, it should cease
supporting the terrorist organization," Atacanli said.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the alleged Syria's support to the PKK, Turkey has
sounded a serious warning against Damascus that Turkey has run out
of its patience over this issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Turkish parliament early last week, Turkish
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz stated that Turkey has to make
necessary preparations for a war against Syria if the Arab
country continues supporting the PKK.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian administration softened its attitude following
Turkey's military warning and signaled a message, conveyed to
Ankara by Egypt, that it would reconsider its policies on this
issue.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Swine Breeders Import Expected to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's imported swine
breeding stocks are expected to fall by 50 percent this year
because of the country's economic slump and demand squeeze, the
Thai News Agency (TNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Pichai Hothongcum, senior general manager of Betagro Hybrid
International Co., one of the major importer of swine breeding
stocks, was quoted as saying the ongoing economic crunch has
reduced local pork consumption and consequently forced local
raisers to cut the capacity by 20 percent from estimated 10
million pigs raised last year.
</P>
<P>
Pichai noted that although discouraged by the falling local
consumption, most raisers remain willing to continue raising pigs,
as the prices of feed meal are now relatively cheap.
</P>
<P>
The number of local raisers also remain stable, as some jobless
workers have entered into the swine farming.
</P>
<P>
For the whole year, the number of raised pigs is estimated at
about 8 million heads worth about 30 billion baht (789 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Now, the price of live pigs is about 40 baht (1.05 dollar) per
kilogram, down from 42-43 baht (1.11-1.13 dollar) per kilogram
over the past two-three months. The price is expected to stand at
this level until the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank to Intervene Baht Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BANGKOK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Thai Central Bank Governor
Chatumongkol Sonakul has said the bank may intervene to prevent
rapid changes in the value of the baht currency to ensure a stable
financial market.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want the baht to dramatically change in the
short-term period. The unit can go up and down but not at a fast
rate," the Thai News Agency on Thursday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The BOT (Bank of Thailand) will slow the rate of change to
support the trade sector," he added.
</P>
<P>
The baht, he said, remained competitively valued against other
currencies although it had made strong gains recently.
</P>
<P>
He said the real effective exchange rate of the baht, as of
October 9, was 13.17 percent weaker than that of currencies of
some 22 other countries, excluding Japan.
</P>
<P>
The baht ended at 38.30 to the U.S. dollar on Thursday from
the level of 41 two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongkol said the central bank would continue to monitor
the movement of the baht currency in order to ensure that it
remains at a competitive level.
</P>
<P>
He also said strengthening of the Japanese yen would likely
boost the country's foreign currency reserves to 28 billion
dollars by the middle of this month, up from 27.4 billion on
October 9.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Congratulates Congress of Disabled Persons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Friday issue of People's
Daily, China's leading newspaper, carries an editorial hailing
the opening of the Third National Congress of the China Federation
of Disabled Persons.
</P>
<P>
The editorial expresses warm regards to the nation's 60 million
handicapped people and over 200 million relatives, as well as
people who work diligently to make life better for disabled people.
</P>
<P>
"The goal of the congress is to proceed under the guidance of
Deng Xiaoping Theory and the guidelines of 15th National Congress
of the Communist Part of China to provide a retrospective of the
road of development for nation's cause to assist disabled
people. The congress will also confirm the major tasks for the
next five years and development goals for the 21st century; unite
and assist handicapped people in their efforts to contribute to
the reform, opening and modernization drive; and provide
encouragement to increase the self-respect, self-confidence and
self-reliance of related individuals."
</P>
<P>
The editorial quoted the late Chinese leader Mao Zedong as
saying: "The blind suffer from one of the most debilitating
afflictions. You have joined the revolution for the cause of
liberating the oppressed and should also liberate those who suffer
most."
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade alone, China adopted the Law on Protecting
the Handicapped, three five-year plans offering related
assistance, and established a number of programs and institutions
to promote the cause.
</P>
<P>
More than four million handicapped people have been
rehabilitated over the past 10 years, with 64.3 percent of the
country's disabled school-age children receiving education,
compared with only six percent a decade ago. In additon, some 73
percent of handicapped people are employed, compared with the
previous rate of less than 50 percent, according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen million poverty-stricken disabled Chinese now have
adequate food and clothing thanks to poverty relief development
programs and the social security system.
</P>
<P>
The editorial urges governments at all levels and society as a
whole to offer greater support and care for the disabled.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Start Shuttle Talks in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Resident Representative
in Cyprus, Dame Ann Hercus, will start from Friday shuttle talks
between Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities on the island in a
fresh bid to seek solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here Thursday by government spokesman
Chirstos Stylianides at his press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said Hercus will first have a meeting with
president Glafcos Clerides on Friday, which aims at clarifying
several issues concerning shuttle talks.
</P>
<P>
"We have already said that after that we can enter a process
of proximity talks," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the third stage of the process would be
direct talks, if a common ground was found.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to participate in such a process which will aim
to solve issues such as reduction of tensions, security and
substance of the Cyprus problem," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said the Cypriot government remained firm on the
implementation of the U.N. resolutions and the results of the
meetings with Secretary-General Kofi Annan in New York last
month.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Chief announced on September 30 that during his
separate meetings with Mr. Glafcos Clerides and Mr. Rauf Denktash
in New York, he proposed that his Deputy special Representative
for Cyprus, Ann Hercus, "develop a process for on-island contacts
with both parties, with the goal of reducing tensions and
promoting progress toward a just and lasting settlement".
</P>
<P>
Both leaders expressed their support for such a process and
have promised to cooperate with it in a constructive and
flexible manner, Annan added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus peace talks broke down last summer when Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash walked out of a U.N.-sponsored
inter-communal talks in Switzerland to protest against an
European Union (EU) decision to start accession talks with the
Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Denktash put forward a proposal in August, calling for the
establishment of a confederation of two equal states in Cyprus
as the basis for resuming talks. The idea was rejected by
the Greek Cypriot-dominated government and U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led international community has been trying for
decades to reunite the island through a bi-zonal, bi-communal
federation formula, but so far no tangible results have been
achieved.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Team to Arrive in Pakistan for Talks With UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A Taliban team will arrive
here Friday for talks with visiting envoys of the United Nations
and the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) on the
present Iran-Afghan tension and the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
Taliban's chief representative in Islamabad Saeedur Rahman
Haqqani told Xinhua Thursday that Wakeel Ahmed, advisor to Taliban
supreme leader Mulla Mohammad Omar, will lead the three-member
delegation for talks with U.N. officials, prominently on the U.N.
difficulties in the Taliban-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
This will be Wakeel's second visit to Pakistan in six days.
Earlier he delivered a letter to U.N. special envoy on Afghanistan
Lakhdar Brahimi from Omar inviting him to visit Afghanistan for
detailed talks in Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi visited Kandahar Wednesday and held a meeting with Omar
which Brahimi described as "useful and constructive."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and the U.N., in series of talks in Islamabad and
Kandahar, discussed U.N. difficulties in the Taliban-controlled
areas and the investigation into the murder of a U.N. official in
Kabul in August.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. had withdrawn its staff from Kabul a few days before
the U.S. cruise missile strikes on alleged terrorist bases in
Khost in August. One U.N. official was reported to be killed in
Kabul during an anti-U.S. demonstration following the strike.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani said that the Taliban will discuss with U.N. officials
their difficulties and ways and means to remove them so that they
could reopen its offices in Kabul. The Taliban officials will
apprise the U.N. officials of investigation into the murder of the
U.N. official.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the release of remaining Iranians held in custody
by the Taliban, Haqqani said he was informed by the U.N. officials
that they were making arrangements for an early evacuation of the
Iranians from Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that airlifting of the Iranians would be completed by
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Brahimi Wednesday in Kandahar, Omar told
Brahimi and OIC Assistant Secretary General Ibrahim Saleh Baker
that all the remaining Iranian prisoners in their custody would be
released.
</P>
<P>
Haqqani said that the U.N.-OIC envoys assured the Taliban
leader that all Taliban prisoners in Iran would also be released.
According to Haqqani, Iran held 80 Taliban prisoners, which Tehran
has denied.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Prices Pick Up 0.3 Percent in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. producer's prices
jumped 0.3 percent in September, the largest rise in a year, the
U.S. Labor Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the larger-than-expected seasonally adjusted increase
in the Producer Price Index (PPI) for finished goods still
followed a stretch of eight declines over 10 months.
</P>
<P>
For the first nine months of the year, producer prices declined
at an annual rate of 0.8 percent, compared with a drop of 1.2
percent for all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that the September gain was influenced by a
shift in the usual pattern for discounting autos and light trucks
in September, the end of the 1998 model year. After adjustment,
car prices rose 2.2 percent, the largest increase in eight years.
Before adjustment, they fell 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Without seasonal adjustment, the overall index for finished
goods would have been unchanged.
</P>
<P>
In September, seasonally adjusted energy prices overall dipped
0.1 percent following August's 2.3 percent plummet. Gasoline fell
two percent and natural gas 1.1 percent. However, heating oil
jumped 6.6 percent, the most in 11 months, and electricity rose
0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Energy has been one of the driving forces behind deflation,
with prices down 11.6 percent from a year earlier. But many
analysts believe they have about bottomed and will no longer be
contributing to deflation.
</P>
<P>
Food prices increased 0.4 percent. Though the prices of beef,
pork and fish all fell, vegetables shot up 12.4 percent and fresh
fruit, 0.8 percent. There were gains topping 30 percent for
squash, corn, grapefruit, potatoes and tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
Deflation remained at earlier stages of the production
process. Prices fell 0.2 percent for intermediate goods and 1.6
percent for crude goods. An example of the three processing stages
is clothing for finished, cloth for intermediate and cotton for
crude.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report today, the Labor Department said
first-time applications for unemployment benefits rose by 2,000 to
a seasonally adjusted 303,000 last week. That level suggests
demand for labor remains robust in the United States despite the
prospect for slower economic growth. Two weeks earlier, the number
of jobless claims hit a five-month low of 290,000.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said inventories of unsold
goods at the nation's businesses rose 0.3 percent in August. Sales
fell 0.2 percent after a 0.1 percent decline in July. They were
the first back-to-back drops since October and November of last
year.

<HEADLINE> Waldner Edges Samsonov in Table Tennis World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANTOU, China, October 15 (Xinhua) -- World champion Jan-Ove
Waldner outfoxed European champion Vladimir Samsonov in a
three-set thriller at the World Cup table tennis tournament here
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Swede, known for wickedly deceptive serve and
devastating follow-up attack, snatched a 14-21, 21-16, 21-19
victory over the 22-year-old Belarussian who is currently ranked
world number one.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, who plays a simple game, but with exceptional
composure and ball control, used his trademark rallies to grab
the first set.
</P>
<P>
The setback jolted Waldner out of lethargy as he got in very
early with vicious loops and sudden, disguised changes of
direction, winning the following two sets in 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Waldner has recorded two wins with Samsonov at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Samsonov overcame a tenacious challenge
from Kalinikos Kreanga of Greece in their opening group game,
while Waldner routed Australia's Oceania champion Mark Smythe in
straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov, who suffered a crushing defeat to Waldner in the
world championship final last year, had beaten the Swede twice
this year --in European Top 12 tournament in January and Croatian
Open in March --both in a score of 3-1.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Kong Linghui, former world champion and 1995 World Cup
winner, kept a clean book by humiliating France's 1993 world
champion Jean-Philippe Gatien in 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Kong, ranked second in the world, handed a
21-15,21-12 loss to the lefthanded attacker.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Kong beat rising star Ma Lin in an
all-Chinese game.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Zoran Primorac had a perfect sheet by
taking his second straight group victory Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Croatian, who beat Sweden's Peter Karlsson
earlier in the day, outlasted South Korean Kim Taek Soo 21-15,
12-21, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
China's Olympic champion Liu Guoliang remained unbeaten with a
21-19, 21-10 win over former world number one Jean-Michel Saive
of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Liu crushed Germany's Jorg Rosskopf 21-17, 21-12.

ARATS Executive Vice-President Tang Shubei and SEF
Vice-Chairman and Secretary-General Shi Hwei-yow attended an
afternoon press conference and gave a briefing on Wang-Koo Meeting.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a reporter's question on Wang's upcoming visit to
Taiwan, Tang said he thinks it would be a bit hasty for Wang to
visit Taiwan within the year.
</P>
<P>
Tang then recounted that the ARATS invitation for Koo to visit
the mainland was finalized in several months. "I think it
represents a good start," said Tang when referring to the
four-point consensus reached by both sides.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the two sides engage in mutual efforts and
reach an even great consensus prior to Wang's visit to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question concerning the resumption of dialog
between ARATS and SEF, Tang cited an agreement he reached with Shi
Hwei-yow calling for joint efforts be made to create conditions
and explore opportunities for the resumption of talks between
the ARATS and SEF.
</P>
<P>
The ARATS and SEF have followed various models and conventional
practices when handling unexpected incidents, Tang said. They will
inform each other of incidents and ensure that related departments
handle cases in a timely and effective manner.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the ARATS and SEF have adopted close contacts and
entrustment approaches to provide mutual assistance, and the
practice fully complies with the current state of the development
of cross-Straits relations, Tang said.

<HEADLINE> Drought Causes Serious Water Shortage in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Drought in Vietnam has caused a
serious water shortage affecting about 3 million people in the
recent months, Vietnam's English newspaper The Saigon Times Daily
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Le Huy Ngo, Vietnam's minister of agriculture
and rural development, as saying at a meeting Wednesday in Hanoi
to celebrate the international disaster relief day that "rainfall
in the past nine months in most of the country fell sharply."
</P>
<P>
Ngo said the drought has bad impact on agricultural production
not only in this year but also in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
He said the Mekong river water level is very low now, measured
at two meters early this month, the lowest level since 1926. If
the drought persists, a shortage of water for power generation and
cultivation will be unavoidable, Ngo added.
</P>
<P>
This year, the theme of the international disaster relief day
is "preventing calamities with information."

PYONGYANG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Foreign
Ministry of Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said
Thursday that DPRK hoped for a peaceful settlement of the dispute
of Kosovo through dialogue and negotiations.

He made the remarks when answering a question asked by the

He said that the Kosovo issue is "precisely an internal affair
of Yugoslavia. Foreign interference, sanctions and military
pressure can not settle the dispute at all."
</P>
<P>
"Non-aligned and many other countries around the world have
bitterly condemned the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) for their projected military operation, and
they are unanimous in calling for a political solution, that is,
negotiated settlement of the dispute," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Even some member nations of NATO are concerned about the
military intervention in Yugoslavia and adopt a wait-and-see
attitude," the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Chaebols Challenge Government in Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 15 (Xinhua) -- South Korean family-owned
conglomerates, or chaebols, Thursday challenged the government to
stop its intervention in their corporate restructuring.
</P>
<P>
"We think our voluntary restructuring will be much more helpful
for enhancing the nation's international creditability than the
one attained under government pressure," said Sohn Byung-doo,
deputy executive chairman of the Federation of Korean Industries
(FKI) after a meeting of top leaders of the chaebol lobby group.
</P>
<P>
The government has upheld free market principles so the
federation hopes it would respect family conglomerates' voluntary
restructuring efforts, Sohn said.
</P>
<P>
Bosses from 16 chaebols, including FKI Chairman Kim Woo-choong,
decided at the meeting to urge the government to give up
intervention in the restructuring when they meet government
officials next week.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that the chaebols openly challenged the
government's restructuring policy.
</P>
<P>
South Korean chaebols are blamed for devouring most banks loans
and shirking responsibility for causing the ongoing financial
crisis with their high debt build-up and over-expansion.
</P>
<P>
The subsidiaries of South Korea's top 30 chaebols were laden
with total debts of some 28 million U.S. dollars by the end of
1997, after the nation was gripped by the unprecedented financial
crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of financial
institutions late last year.
</P>
<P>
The chaebols, especially the top five -- Hyundai, Samsung,
Daewoo, LG and SK -- have recently been under mounting pressure
from the government and the public for dragging their feet in
merging their excessive investments and overlaps in seven key
industrial sectors, including semiconductor and power generation.
</P>
<P>
Calling an August agreement on business mergers reached among
the top five chaebols "half-baked and insufficient," the
government has threatened to cut off new loans to the companies
involved in the restructuring of semiconductor and power generator
sectors unless they complete their mergers by the end of November
this year.
</P>
<P>
In the semiconductor sector, Hyundai and LG have been
deadlocked over managerial control of their joint company.
</P>
<P>
Under the restructuring plan in power generator industry
announced by the federation on October 7, the chaebols agreed to
maintain a dual management system between Korea Heavy Industries &AMP;
Construction Corp. (Hanjung) and Hyundai, after Samsung hands over
its boiler facility business to Hanjung.

<HEADLINE> Positive Impact Forecast for EU's Agricultural Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Housewives in the European
Union (EU) may expect to find cheaper foodstuffs once the reforms
of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) have been implemented.
</P>
<P>
The positive forecast, published on Thursday as a result of
independent studies on the overall impact of the reforms, said
consumer price index was expected to drop by 0.45 percent, while
household food bills to drop by 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Farmers are also expected to benefit from the CAP reforms as
they were expected to see increased income, projected to be
between 22 percent and 34 percent per labor unit, compared to the
relatively high level of the 1992-1996 period.
</P>
<P>
The studies were carried out by the statistical bureau of the
European community, the University of Bonn and the University of
Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
The studies also forecast an increase in agricultural
production and internal demand, a 0.4-percent increase in gross
domestic product (GDP) and a 0.2-percent increase in employment.
</P>
<P>
European Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said the
studies gave incontrovertible proof that CAP reforms is beneficial
not only for the agricultural sector but for the economy of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
It is, therefore, time for agriculture ministers of the EU
member states to enter into serious negotiations on the
implementation of the CAP reforms, Fischler said.

Rasheed airport in Baghdad on Thursday, on board British MP
George Gallaway and Iraqi sick child Maryam Hamza who is
suffering from leukemia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to reporters, Gallaway said that the
five-year-old Hamza is a symbol of the sufferings of Iraqi
children due to the continuation of the U.N. sanctions since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Gallaway said Hamza has been treated in a hospital in Glasgow,
Scotland, for six months.
</P>
<P>
Hamza underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the hospital
and is now in a remission state, an Iraqi official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Her treatment cost some 93,000 U.S. dollars, which was paid
through private donations.
</P>
<P>
The British MP, who has been critical of the British anti-Iraq
policy, called on all states in the world to work for lifting the
embargo which claimed lives of thousands of Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed punishing sanctions -- including a
ban on air travel and limits on sales of oil -- on Iraq following
its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Gallaway said that Hamza sent a letter to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday calling upon him to work for
lifting the embargo off Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Gallaway visited Iraq last March and met a number of Iraqi
officials and got acquainted with the health situation in
Iraq. In April, he visited Iraq for the second time and returned
home taking with him Hamza for treatment.

<HEADLINE> Ben Johnson to Race against Horses and Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada's sprinter Ben Johnson
will set his foot on the track Thursday again, this time in
competition with two horses and a car.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the 36-year-old sprinter runs on a track
meat for horses at a charity fund-raising event, Canada's leading
newspaper the Globe and Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Once a dominant figure in men's 100-meter field, Johnson has
been suspended from track and field since 1993 when he was tested
positive for the second time in his career.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's sideshow presentation may be the start of Johnson's
new career -- as a curiosity, media magnet and pitchman, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
His presence is expected to draw at least 5,000 people to the
oceanside track in Charlottetown, Prince of Edward Island. Money
from the tickets will go to a local children's wish foundation.
</P>
<P>
The man-beast-machine race is believed the first in Canada,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Each contestant will race a different distance. Johnson will
be set 80 meters from the finish line. The two horses will start
from 100 meters and 120 meters from the finish, while the car 140
meters.
</P>
<P>
The race will begin with the crack of a starter's pistol. But
a start official will also wave a flag for the car driver, who
might not hear the report of the pistol over the noise of his
engine.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Investors Hold Hope for Wang-Koo Meeting (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan investors are placing
great hope in the landmark mainland visit of Koo Chen-fu, chairman
of the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) and his
delegation.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday and Taiwan
business people have expressed great hope that Koo's
meetings with Wang Daohan, president of the Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), will lead to the early
realization of direct mail, trade and shipping across the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
"We sincerely hope that the visit will help promote
communications and mutual understanding between the parties on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits," said D.C. Yang, chairman of the
Shanghai Association of Taiwan-Funded Enterprises. Yang made the
remarks during a banquet welcoming the Taiwan delegation.
</P>
<P>
The over 3,200 Taiwan-funded enterprises in Shanghai, China'
major financial and commercial center, were established with a
total investment of 3.6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Direct mail, trade and shipping across the Taiwan Straits
should be realized at the earliest possible date," said Yang
Liangfu, chairman of the board of the Taiwan-funded Fule Food
Company.
</P>
<P>
Yang, who is also an association council member, held that the
resumption of contacts and high-level talk between ARATS and SEF
offer great hope for the resolution of many issues.
</P>
<P>
Between 2-3 million people currently travel between the two
sides of the Straits on an annual basis. Nonetheless, the two
sides have not as yet ended lingering hostilities and various
obstacles originated by Taiwan authorities. The requirement for
people to travel through Hong Kong and Macao adds both costs and
time to the journey.

"I hope the meeting between ARATS and SEF leaders will define
the appropriate path for the future development of cross-Straits
relations," according to Jerry Tsai, chairman of the Association
of Taiwan-funded Enterprises in Ningbo, a major port city in east
China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
ARATS and SEF have differences of opinion, said Tsai, adding
that leaders of the two organizations will undoubtedly continue
their efforts to expand communications.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan investors are eagerly looking forward to the early
realization of direct mail, trade and shipping across the Taiwan
Straits in order to substantially reduce operating costs," said
Yang Shunde, a Taiwan investor in Huadu, south China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
Yang said it is unrealistic to assume that this particular
round of Wang-Koo meetings will lead to any concrete
solutions. However, he noted that the fact ARATS and SEF
have initiated exchange visits must be regarded as a "highly
significant achievement".
</P>
<P>
"Wang and Koo are both highly knowledgeable open-minded
leaders, and ensuing meeting and exchanges of views will
undoubtedly prove fruitful," according to Yang.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong has undergone great
changes both politically and economically since its return to the
motherland in July last year, said Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press conference here on Thursday
before leaving for a second duty visit to Beijing. Tung made his
first duty visit last December.
</P>
<P>
Politically, Hong Kong has changed from a territory under
colonial rule into a highly-autonomous SAR where the concepts of
"One Country, Two Systems" are being implemented, Tung said. And
the serious efforts made by China's central government in the
implementation of the concepts had been recognized worldwide. This
is a great achievement scored by the central government and the
6.5 million people of Hong Kong SAR, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Economically, although Hong Kong is facing a tough challenge
brought about by the regional financial crises, the SAR government
has made great efforts for economic recovery and in this respect
we now have a clear-cut orientation, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a very good economic foundation and therefor there is
a good chance for a steady recovery of our economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
And the most important thing for the people of Hong Kong is
that they must be confident of themselves so that the economy
could recover soon, he added.

MACAO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior security official of
Macao said here Thursday evening that police authorities in Macao
and Beijing have agreed to strengthen cooperation in the crackdown
on organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
Brigadeiro M. Monge, Macao government's secretary for security,
made the remark at the Macao International Airport on returning
from his one-week visit to the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, he met with Jia Chunwang, minister of public

The Chinese officials pay much attention to the public security
affairs in Macao, said Monge, who in turn talked about the
endeavor of the Macao government to crack down on crimes,
especially on trans-border crimes and organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will take measures to enhance the contact of
security officials and information exchange between the security
authority of Macao and those in Beijing, Guangzhou and Zhuhai,
Monge said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary noted that the effect of fighting against crimes
depends on the close cooperation of security authorities near
Macao.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Hails Political Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine welcomes the efforts to
seek a political solution to the crisis in Kosovo and supports
U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke's mediation in the troubled
southern Serbian province, an official statement said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
While noting that the Ukrainian government is happy with the
latest development in Kosovo, the foreign ministry statement said
Ukraine is ready to send representatives to join the planned
international observation mission heading for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO on Tuesday night authorized air strikes on Yugoslavia at
any time but gave the Yugoslav government four days' grace to
comply with all United Nations demands, including allowing
international aid agencies to access freely to Kosovo and
thousands of refugees to go back home.
</P>
<P>
Following the NATO decision, Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, in an agreement reached with Holbrooke, provided
guarantee on the withdrawal of Serbian security forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian government said in the statement that it
understood why NATO made such an air strike decision against
Yugoslavia. And it also hoped that the Yugoslav leadership would
take new steps to implement the U.N. Security Council resolution
1199, so as to avert a possible NATO military intervention.
</P>
<P>
To safeguard Yugoslavia's territorial integrity and provide
Kosovo an extensive autonomy should be the basis for a peaceful
end to the crisis there, the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Important for EU, says EC Ambassador in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The ever first visit by the
president of the European Commission (EC) to Hong Kong early next
month demonstrates that the European Union (EU) attaches great
importance to the city, the EU ambassador in Hong Kong said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Etienne Reuter, head of the Office of the European Commission
in Hong Kong, told reporters Thursday afternoon that a delegation
led by the EC President Jacques Santer and Vice President Leon
Brittan will pay a visit to Hong Kong between November 2-3 as part
of their trip to China.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of the EC, executive body of the EU, will
comprise EC officials and a number of European businessmen. They
are scheduled to arrive in China on October 29 and will come to
Hong Kong after their visits to Beijing and Shanghai, Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
Their visit to Hong Kong will also coincide with the second
meeting of the EU-Hong Kong Business Cooperation Council, which
was established in October last year when Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
visited the EC. The first meeting of the council was held last
year in Brussels, where the EU headquarters is located.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit by an EC president to China since 1985
and the first visit by an EC president ever to HK, Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day visit to Hong Kong, Santer and Brittan will
meet HKSAR officials, members of the Legislative Council and
business leaders to talk about political as well as economic
issues including the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Reuter said that the delegation will convey three messages to
Hong Kong. The first is to congratulate Hong Kong on its smooth
reunification with China, Reuter said.
</P>
<P>
The second is that the EC understand the HKSAR's measures to
intervene in the stock and futures markets in Hong Kong and the EC
is convinced that Hong Kong remains an open and free market.
</P>
<P>
The third message is that EC will seek ways to strengthen the
cooperation between Hong Kong and the EU.
</P>
<P>
Reuter said that Hong Kong is very important to European
countries as a bridge between China and Europe and a business hub
to Asia. There are more than 50,000 EU citizens and some 600
EU-based companies in Hong Kong.

<P>
JERUSALEM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Rockets hit villages in
northern Israel Thursday, without causing casualties, Israel Radio
quoted army sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rockets, which were fired from south Lebanon, landed at the
villages in the West Galilee area, damaging properties there, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the attack. But it did not give the reasons.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is leading a war of attrition against Israel in south
Lebanon, where the Jewish state set up a self-styled security zone
to allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks
by Lebanon's Muslim guerrillas.
</P>

Under a ceasefire agreement signed in 1996, Israel and Lebanon
agreed not to attack each other's civilian targets in any military

<HEADLINE> India to Launch New National Database on Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- India has planned to launch a
nationwide knowledge system that would provide farmers with the
latest information on agriculture to help attain sustainable food
security, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new system, to be launched in January next year, will
concentrate on information empowerment of the socially- and
economically-unprivileged sections of the country, the PTI quoted
agriculture scientist M. S. Swaminathan as saying.
</P>
<P>
The information would reach farmers via a network of computers,
public telephones and wireless services, said Swaminathan,
chairman of the M. S. Swaminathan Research Foundation based in
Chennai, formerly Madras, capital of the southeast state of Tamil
Nadu.
</P>
<P>
The ex-director general of the Indian Council of Agricultural
Research told the 49th Congress of International Federation of
Information and Documentation which is underway in New Delhi that
such a system, developed by his foundation, would help the nation
attain sustainable food security.
</P>
<P>
It will provide information on safe drinking water,
environmental hygiene and productivity increase through
eco-friendly technologies and improved distribution system, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Food Safety Campaign Underway in EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A special campaign began on
Thursday in all European Union countries to inform food producers,
processors, retailers and consumers about their respective
responsibilities and rights concerning food safety.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, launched by the European Commission and expected
to extend into next year, was expected to drive home the message
that food safety is a shared responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The campaign was launched in response to a specific demand from
consumers for more information on the subject. A survey carried
out in late 1997 found 68 percent of consumers were concerned
about food safety.
</P>
<P>
Officials on the European Commission, the executive body of the
15-nation European Union, said that it is difficult to accept that
a single link in the food chain is to blame for food poisoning
incidents.
</P>
<P>
A single link is as dangerous as all other links put together,
they added.
</P>
<P>
The approach of the ongoing campaign will be to highlight the
importance of following the instructions given on the labels on
food packages and abiding by the basic rules of hygiene.
</P>
<P>
The campaign intends to target not only consumers in general
but also specific population groups such as school pupils and
students, servicemen and women and enterprise employees.
</P>
<P>
European Consumer Policy Commissioner Emma Bonino said:
"Consumers are concerned about food safety, they are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
"But I want everyone to be aware that food safety does not
depend on just one link in the food chain but demands constant
effort on the part of all involved, from the producer to the
consumer."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- China has 874 forest parks on a
total of 7.48 million hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-eight of those parks cover more than 10,000 hectares
each and separate coverage of five parks reaches more than 100,000
hectares, according Sun Gang, deputy director of the China
National Tourism Administration.
</P>
<P>
Forest tourism has developed rapidly since the first
State-level forest park was built in Zhangjiajie, Hunan Province,
in 1982, Sun says. The forest parks have had more than 50
million tourists annually in recent years. From 1992 to 1997,
earnings from forest parks amounted to more than 2 billion yuan,
and nearly 100,000 farmers got away from poverty in this way.
</P>
<P>
China has put more than a billion yuan into improving scenic
spots and services in the forest parks in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Sun says that developing forest tourism will be a key project
for the '99 China Ecological Tourism Year. A Forestry Ministry
plan calls for 2,000 forest parks by the year 2010, on 19 million
hectares of land.

<HEADLINE> India Says Not to Act Under International Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- India asserted Thursday that
there was no question of New Delhi acting under international
pressure in dealing with outstanding bilateral issues with
Pakistan and again ruled out any third party involvement in
resolving them.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of crucial Indo-Pakistan foreign secretary-level
talks beginning Friday in Islamabad, a spokesman from the External
Affairs Ministry said Thursday that the international community
has strongly expressed its desire that India and Pakistan resolve
all outstanding issues peacefully and bilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that Washington was pressurizing
both India and Pakistan to agree to a nuclear restraint regime.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that India has always desired
peaceful, friendly and cooperative relations with Pakistan and for
this purpose has urged Islamabad to engage in a broad-based and
comprehensive dialogue which would move the relationship forward
over a broad front.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue would provide for a discussion on all pending
issues including Jammu and Kashmir, he said, adding that all
Indian proposals for the composite dialogue process have included
discussions on Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
After suspension of 13 months, India and Pakistan are set to
resume the talks Friday in Islamabad amid mutual suspicion and
with little hope for any breakthrough especially on Kashmir, the
most contentious issue between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been tense after the
nuclear tests first by India and then by Pakistan in May this
year, which Pakistan said have further internationalized the
Kashmir dispute India has insisted as a bilateral issue.
</P>
<P>
The strained relations further deteriorated following reports
days ago that India is going to stage a large-scale military
exercise near the Pakistan border which evoked strong reaction
from Islamabad accusing New Delhi of vitiating the atmosphere on
the eve of the foreign secretary-level talks.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that
Islamabad was extremely disturbed by the reports (of Indian
military exercises), particularly by the reported nature, size and
timing of the exercises.
</P>
<P>
However, Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes said the
exercises pose no concern to any nation as such maneuvers are
routine with all countries.
</P>
<P>
Indian External Affairs Ministry said earlier that New Delhi
was looking forward to the resumption of the talks with an "open
mind", while Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz said frankly
that no major breakthrough was expected from these meetings.
</P>
<P>
Judging by the attitude of both sides on eve of the talks,
there is remote possibility of any major progress as the issue of
Kashmir, which had led to the breakdown of the talks 13 months
ago, continues to be the dividing point as was evident from the
strong statements issued from both New Delhi and Islamabad
recently.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan declared Tuesday that it would speak on behalf of the
Kashmir people while India dubbed the statement as "utterly
absurd" and stressed that Kashmir remains an integral part of
India.
</P>
<P>
Jammu and Kashmir is one of the two issues scheduled to be
taken up for discussions during the Islamabad round of the talks
between the two countries while the other identified issues will
be discussed during talks in New Delhi from November 5 to 13.

GUILIN, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, the chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, spoke today
about the Asia-Pacific region's environmental protection and
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
Parliaments, governments and non-governmental organizations of
those countries in the region have common interests and similar
long-range goals and can do a lot in this area, he told the 6th
General Assembly of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians Conference
on the Environment and Development that opened here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government places great importance on
environmental and development matters and has made an effort to
increase international and regional cooperation. In recent years,
the National People's Congress has developed laws and regulations
on environmental protection and formed the legal framework for
controlling environmental pollution and for law enforcement, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In March 1997, the National People's Congress decided that any
act leading to serious environmental damage is a crime. By the end
of last year, China closed 65,000 small factories that were
causing pollution and formulated a national plan for improving the
environment.
</P>
<P>
China has made its contributions to the international
environmental and developmental cause, he said.

However, Li said, the Chinese government is aware of the fact
that the environmental situation is still "very grim" and the
country faces an immense amount of work in protecting the
environment, bit it is confident that it can solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
This morning, NPC Standing Committee Vice-chairman Zou Jiahua
asked the international community to develop policies that will
ensure the development of tourism.
</P>
<P>
Pete Hodgson, acting chairman of the conference's executive
committee, said it has become a commonplace that environmental
protection should be placed before development. He expressed
appreciations for the preparations and arrangements China has made
for the conference and said he hopes to acquire a better
understanding of China's efforts and achievements in environmental
protection at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Qu Geping, chairman of the conference and head of the Chinese
delegation, presided over today's session.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng and his wife Zhu Lin met with leaders of various
countries' delegations and their spouses this evening and later Li
hosted a reception in honor of all participants in the conference.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 delegates from 27 countries and international
organizations attended the conference which will last through

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in S.Korea Begins Gaining Vitality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment in
South Korea amounted to 532 million U.S. dollars in September, up
30.7 percent from the previous month's 407 million dollars, the
Ministry of Finance and Economy said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The investment growth also represented an increase of 22.6
percent from 434 million dollars in the same period last year, the
ministry said through a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign investment in Korea began picking up again last month
after suffering a setback in August due to seasonal factors and
the spread of international financial jitters," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In the year's first four months, foreign investment remained in
the doldrums as foreign confidence in the crisis-stricken South
Korean economy sank, but it began picking up in May due to the
implementation of far-reaching restructuring measures.
</P>
<P>
However, in August, foreign capital inflow plunged 67 percent
to 407 million dollars from 1.23 billion in July.
</P>
<P>
In the year up to September, foreign investment were 4.63
billion dollars, a drop of 15.4 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The fall in investment was attributed to poor investor
sentiment following the financial turmoil that hit South Korea
late last year, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
"We expect foreign investment in Korea to begin a full-fledged
upward spiral in October since new legislation on foreign
investment was passed in September and because the government's
efforts to court foreign investment are expected to produce
results," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said investment through equity purchases of local
companies have increased sharply since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months, foreign investment through equity
purchases amounted to one billion dollars, accounting for 21.7
percent of total investments.
</P>
<P>
Of 92 projects worth more than 10 million dollars, 34 were in
the form of equity purchases, indicating that foreign investors
have been capitalizing on the lifting of restrictions on foreign
ownership of local companies.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment in South Korea includes equity
purchases by foreigners of local companies on the over-the-counter
market and creation of independent or joint-venture companies,
said the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Cruises Through 63 U.S. Cents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar shot to
levels not seen in three months Thursday, closing firmly above 63
U.S. cents, and looks set to rally further.
</P>
<P>
Solid hedge fund buying lifted the currency to a high of 63.65
U.S. cents before it closed at 63.61, more than half a U.S. cent
above Wednesday's finish of 62.88.
</P>
<P>
Since Friday last week, the local dollar has gained two U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
Craig James, chief economist with Colonial State Bank, said the
Australian dollar could be likened to "the great Houdini."
</P>
<P>
"Over the last seven trading days, the Australian dollar has
gained nine percent against the U.S. dollar," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is driven by substantial demand from American accounts,"
Peter McGrath, chief foreign exchange dealer at Westpac Banking
Corp., said.
</P>
<P>
"It looks quite strong actually, very strong and there doesn't
look to be any fundamentals behind the move other than just supply
and demand.
</P>
<P>
"So it looks set to continue at this stage and couldn't rule
out a test of 64 (U.S. cents), and perhaps a little bit above
there in coming days," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, McGrath said the U.S. dollar would likely need to go
down below 115 Japanese yen and stay there for the Australian to
sustain the pace above 64 U.S. cents in the medium term.
</P>
<P>
"But that could happen and we may see the Aussie squeeze higher
over the coming months," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 75.26 Japanese yen from 75.20
and 1.0392 German marks from 1.0293.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Forms Team to Probe Soeharto's Wealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Attorney General's
Office has set up a team to look into former president Soeharto's
alleged hidden wealth in all parts of the country, an official
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We have ordered the public prosecutor's offices in all
provinces to cooperate with relevant agencies in tracing former
president Soeharto's wealth in all parts of Indonesia," deputy
head of the Attorney General's Office Ismu Djoko said in Jambi,
capital of Jambi province in southern part of Sumatra island.
</P>
<P>
If there are reports that Soeharto has plants, houses or land
in the provinces, the Attorney General's Office will send its team
to trace the property, Djoko was quoted by Antara News Agency as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the National Land Agency, Soeharto
has land in 10 of the country's 27 provinces.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that he also has properties, including land, in
other provinces. Relevant agencies, especially the National Land
Agency, can cooperate with the public prosecutor's offices in
tracing the properties," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has set up two teams to investigate
Soeharto's alleged corruption and his wealth.
</P>
<P>
Home and foreign reports have accused Soeharto of amassing
wealth illegally during his 32-year reign and stashing the fortune
overseas.
</P>
<P>
But Soeharto, who stepped down amid mounting public pressure on
May 21, swore that he did not have any deposits abroad in a
statement broadcast by his daughter's television station early
September.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Attorney General's Office is slow in tracing
Soeharto's wealth, Djoko said the team set up by the office is
working hard to collect as much evidence as possible.
</P>
<P>
The team needs members who are very serious in tracing
Soeharto's wealth, he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran not to Reschedule Foreign Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Thursday that
it would not reschedule its foreign debts despite of a serious
financial problem caused by the fall in oil price.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is not intent on rescheduling of its foreign debts,"
Mohammad Mojarad, deputy governor of the Central Bank of Iran
(CBI), told the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Mojarad said that all the Iranian banks have been instructed
to fulfill their undertakings on time and in case of any delay,
the due fine should be paid to their foreign bank partners.
</P>
<P>
He put Iran's foreign debts at 12.3 billion U.S. dollars,
equivalent to one year's oil revenues at the price of 12 dollars
per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Mojarad, who is in charge of the CBI foreign exchange affairs,
said that Iran's arrears amounted to 4 billion dollars, which
should be paid by the end of the next Iranian year (March 20,
2000).
</P>
<P>
Iran was forced to reschedule its foreign debts in 1993
because of excessive imports in 1992 and a sharp fall in its oil
revenue caused by oil price slump.
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomats here doubt if Iran would pay off its foreign
debts this year since oil price slump once again dealt a serious
blow to the government revenue this year.
</P>
<P>
Mojarad said that Iran's oil revenues in the first half of the
current Iranian year (started on March 21) amounted to 5 billion
dollars, some 3 billion dollars less than the figure anticipated
in the budget for the period.
</P>
<P>
He put the total hard currency expenditures in the first half
of the year at 9.4 billion dollars, which was met through
borrowing over 1.3 billion dollars from foreign exchange
reserves, 5 billion dollars from oil revenues and 3.1 billion
dollars through other means, including advance oil sales and
receiving credit facilities.
</P>
<P>
The CBI official said that Iran would receive foreign credits
of 3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the foreign credits to be received
in the second half of the year would compensate for the deficit in
oil revenues, so that the government would not be forced to make
major adjustments, especially in the production sector.

<HEADLINE> Outside Laborers to Macao Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Although the government had
pledged to cut laborers coming outside Macao this year, the actual
number of outside laborers turned out to rise over the same period
last year, Journal Va Kio reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vitor Pessoa, secretary for economic coordination, was quoted
as saying Wednesday that the government is making efforts to
reduce the number of outside laborers, but the positive result
cannot be seen for the time being.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the increase was caused by the quota which
had been approved by the government earlier.
</P>
<P>
To ease unemployment in Macao, the government has cut or
restricted the number of outside laborers in the sectors of trade,
tourism and catering trade, said the secretary, adding that the
moves have to be carried out gradually.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the unemployment rate in
Macao hit 5.1 percent between June and August this year.
</P>
<P>
Asked when Macao's economy would turn better, Pessoa said that
the question was hard to answer, for the local economy is heavily
affected by depressive economic circumstances around Macao.

SINGAPORE, October 15 (Xinhua ) -- Singapore is gearing up to
deliver 4,000 metric tons of rice and a supply of medicines to the
Riau province of Indonesia in implementation of its humanitarian
aid to Indonesia, according to a government press release.
</P>
<P>
These rice and medicines will be delivered in two ships in

On behalf of the Singapore government, Edward Lee, Singapore

and medicines the Singapore Government would extend to Indonesia
on humanitarian base.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK Facing Pricing Pressure, Trade Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Increasing competition from
other supplier countries and regions whose currencies have
devalued in the course of the Asian financial crisis will continue
to pose pressure on prices of Hong Kong's exports in the coming
year, according to a report.
</P>
<P>
The report, released by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council
(TDC) Thursday, said Hong Kong companies should be vigilant on the
undercurrent of regionalism and restrictive trade measures
triggered by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on a TDC study on Hong Kong's external trade,
found that merchandise exports, including offshore trade, managed
by Hong Kong traders and manufacturers, were able to hold on
despite the devaluation of other Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
The report said a strong U.S. dollar, falling prices of raw
materials and components as well as intensified competition have
led to a continued decline in export prices.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's external performance so far this year has been
significantly affected by the Asian economic turmoil, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
"Given this most serious challenge currently faced by the world
economy in 50 years, the adjustment in Hong Kong's export
performance is not surprising," said TDC's chief economist Edward
Leung.
</P>
<P>
However, Leung still maintained a positive view on the longer
term outlook of Hong Kong's external economy, pointing to the
steady economic growth in the U.S. and in the European Union, two
of Hong Kong's major export markets.
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. and the EU economies will continue to expand at a
moderate pace, providing Hong Kong exports with the much-needed
vitality, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, sales to the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong's
largest market, are expected to be stable given the steady
expansion of the mainland's economy, it said.

help rehabilitate drug users in six days.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came today at a conference sponsored by the
Traditional Chinese Medicine Administration, the International
Exchange Center of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Gansu
Academy of National Science and Technology of China.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jihao, president of the Gansu Academy, said that the
tablet contains traditional Chinese and Tibetan medicine
ingredients produced with modern pharmaceutical techniques.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zuoning, a prominent Chinese psychiatrist, says that the
medicine can stop narcotic effects and relieve pain, strengthening
the body's resistance and eliminating pathogenic factors and
tranquilizing the mind.
</P>
<P>
It can get rid of toxins in the body of patients in three to
six days and help them withdraw completely from drug dependence,
Jiang said.

Research on the medicine started ten years ago. In the past
three years, 68,000 patients have been rehabilitated with the help
of the medicine.

SHANTOU, China, October 15 (Xinhua) -- World top-ranked

Kreanga in their opening group game at the World Cup table tennis
tournament here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Belarussian, European champion and Top 12
winner, came from one set down to beat the 10th-ranked Greek
17-21, 21-19, 21-15 in Group A.
</P>
<P>
There were some brilliant forehand drive exchanges as Kreanga
nosed ahead 17-14.
</P>
<P>
Kreanga built on this cushion and pulled further clear until
he forced Samsonov into a wayward backhand to go one up.
</P>
<P>
Samsonov displayed excellent poise and balance in the second
set, employing consistent topsin strokes from both wings which
were to much for his rival.
</P>
<P>
The lanky Belarussian led all the way to nail the third set.

In the other Group A game, reigning world champion Jan-Ove
Waldner routed Oceania champion Mark Smythe of Australia 21-8,

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Ministry of
Environmental Co-ordination Thursday issued a press communique
here saying the government will burn out-dated fertilizer in the
furnace of Mozambique Cement Company.
</P>
<P>
A survey by Mozambique's Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries
during 1994 and 1995 indicated that a total of 250 tons of
out-dated fertilizer were found in the country.
</P>
<P>
If they are not properly disposed, the fertilizer will pose
great damage to the environment. Experts suggest to gather all
the fertilizer together and burn them in the furnace of the
cement company which is located in Matola industrial town, about
10 km from the capital Maputo.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Figures Show Australian Economy Defies Asian Impacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Australian economy is
apparently warding off the impact of the Asian crisis, with new
figures showing an improvement in long-term unemployment and
painting an optimistic outlook for manufacturing industries and
business.
</P>
<P>
The authorized Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said
Thursday the number of Australians out of work for more than a
year fell sharply in September, by 2.6 percent to 251,900, wiping
out a sharp rise in August.
</P>
<P>
However, the long-term unemployed still made up a third of all
Australia's jobless.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a survey by the Australian Industry Group, newly
formed from the merger of Australia's two peak industry bodies,
forecast a major improvement in the manufacturing sector in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
The survey of more than 1,000 companies found 37 percent of
manufacturers had lifted their output, while 32 percent cut
production in the September quarter.
</P>
<P>
It found 40 percent of manufacturers reported a rise in sales,
marginally offsetting the 36 percent whose sales fell.
</P>
<P>
Despite continued job losses in the sector, manufacturers were
optimistic about the future.
</P>
<P>
The survey found the manufacturing sector forecast a profit in
the current December quarter for the first time in more than 12
months, resulting from a sharp rise in production, sales and
exports and a further improvement in investment in plant and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey expressed caution over the impact of the
Asian crisis. "Given that expectations tend to overstate actual
outcomes, care should be taken when interpreting these results,
particularly given that the full impact of the Asian crisis is yet
to be felt," the survey warned.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the National Australia Bank quarterly business survey
found business conditions improved slightly in the September
quarter, although conditions contracted for the second consecutive
quarter.
</P>
<P>
But the survey highlighted a degree of variability across
industries.
</P>
<P>
Mining, manufacturing and wholesaling continued to experience
poor conditions while the business and property services sector
recorded the strongest results.
</P>
<P>
The only sector to report a significant deterioration in
business conditions was transport, storage and communications.
</P>
<P>
Firms anticipated business conditions would improve further in
the December quarter.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Promotes Export to Uganda: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's official
export to Uganda have doubled over the past four years, rising
from 24.4 million U.S. Dollars in 1994 to 48.8 million, local
daily the Star reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Uganda mainly consist of industrial goods and raw
materials, construction and transport machinery, newsprint and
sugar.
</P>
<P>
Senior Ugandan Trade Ministry official Richard Kamajugo was
quoted as saying that the sharp rise in South African exports to
Uganda was the result of cooperation between the two countries
after the 1994 general election, and subsequent signing of trade
and double taxation agreements.
</P>
<P>
Before 1994 there was no recorded trade between Uganda and
South Africa and the little trade that did not exist had to go
through a third country because there was no cooperation between
the two governments.
</P>
<P>
According to Kamajugo, Uganda had remain a deficit exporter to
South Africa, with only 185,900 U.S. Dollars worth of goods
exported in 1996, and 2.4 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Local trade experts predicted that South African exports to
Uganda will rise further owing to promotional campaigns by South
African industrialists and the shorter period of goods delivery
from South Africa compared with Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Freight costs from South Africa expected to fall drastically
once the country's railway network linking southern, eastern and
central Africa gets operational.
</P>
<P>
A South African trade delegation headed by Trade and Industry
Minister Alec Erwin visited Uganda in July in a bid to promote
its export to the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that an ever increasing number of South
African firms is establishing branches in Uganda with an eye on
the country's 20 million population strong market, as well as
those in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
According to Uganda Investment Authority figures, South Africa
has become a leading source of investments to Uganda, upstaging
traditional sources such as Kenya, India, and Canada.

</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said in a statement that he was

Nzo paid tribute to the responsible manner in which all the
parties had committed themselves to placing the interests of the
people of Lesotho above their own.

<P>
"The spirit of compromise by the Lesotho government and
opposition alliance needs to be commended and encouraged. This
now opens the way for the vital process of reconstruction to
start."
</P>
<P>
Nzo welcomed United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan's
statement on Wednesday, in which he committed U.N. assistance to

<HEADLINE> 30 Lesotho Mutinous Soldiers Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Thirty of Lesotho's rebel
soldiers who participated in a mutiny in September were arrested
early Thursday morning, South African Press Association (SAPA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho Defense Force (LDF) chief Makhule Mosakeng said in
Maseru that the group was selected from more than 1,500 soldiers
who returned to army headquarters after Southern African
Development Community (SADC) commanders requested the arrests.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted military sources as saying that the group tried to
resist arrest, saying SADC troops had no power to arrest them.
But they later agreed to be taken to Lesotho's maximum security
prison near Maseru.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho opposition parties immediately called on South African
High Commissioner Japhet Ndhlovu to question the arrests and
demanded the immediate release of the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"Their arrest violates the spirit of agreements reached at
yesterday's (Wednesday) talks which are aimed at normalizing
things in Lesotho," said opposition alliance spokesman Vincent
Malebu.
</P>
<P>
"We want those people to be freed immediately. We can't want
to normalize things and at the same time arrest others..."
</P>
<P>
Malebu called on the signatories of Wednesday's agreement to
ensure that intervening forces were not in Lesotho to arrest
people, but to maintain law and order, peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's agreement provided for the establishment of a
transitional structure to prepare the nation for new general
elections in 15 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Junior Lesotho soldiers launched a mutiny in early September,
accusing Mosakeng and 28 other senior army officers of being
puppets of the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy. Mosakeng
and the senior officers were forced to resign at gun point.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili's government called for SADC
intervention and on September 22, SADC troops arrived in Lesotho
to deal with what SADC officials described as a coup in the
making.
</P>
<P>
Skirmishes broke out between SADC troops and Lesotho soldiers
and more than 70 people died, including 18 LDF soldiers and eight
South African soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Reaches $8 Billion in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
in August reached 1,157.6 billion yen (about 8.0 billion
U.S. dollars), or up 43.6 percent from the same period last year,
marking the 17th straight monthly increase, the Japanese Finance
Ministry said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Exports came to 3,842.9 billion yen (about 26.6 billion
dollars), up 0.7 percent largely due to brisk demand for aircraft
and automobile engines, and steel products, the ministry said in a
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports dropped by 5.5 percent to 2,752.2 billion
yen (about 19.0 billion dollars) because of the declining domestic
demand.
</P>
<P>
Although imports from the United States rose by 9.3 percent,
those from Japan's Asian neighbors and the 15-member European
Union slipped by 3.0 percent and 2.4 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Fewer Japanese were traveling abroad due to the weak yen,
causing the services deficit to shrink by 50.2 billion yen (about
347 million dollars) to 544.0 billion yen (about 3.8 billion
dollars), the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The current account measures the flow of goods and services, as
well as investment income and other monetary transfers.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen averaged 144.67 to the U.S. dollar in August,
compared with 117.90 yen a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Tibetans Learning How To Protect Rights Via The Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The word 'lawyer' was largely met
with indifference by most Tibetans 20 years ago, but law firms
have become a fairly common part of their lives today.
</P>
<P>
Yangzomg, a Tibetan woman who lives near Lhasa, the capital of
Tibet Autonomous Region, turned to lawyers for help when she
discovered that her ex-husband had concealed his possessions when
they got divorced.
</P>
<P>
When she got the house back and got child-support payments, she
explained her actions by saying, "Quarreling with him was futile
and I knew that only the law and lawyers could help me defend my
rights."
</P>
<P>
A construction company in Rinbung County also benefited from
the law when it won a lawsuit involving more than 700,000 yuan in
unpaid debts. Tsering Qoipei, the manager of the company, said
they used to rely on administrative mediators, but that their
problem remained unsolved until they turned to the law. "The court
is more efficient and impartial than administrative offices," he
explains.
</P>
<P>
Tibet currently has 11 law offices with 48 professional
lawyers, 40 percent of whom are Tibetans. Since law firms opened
for business here in 1985, they have handled about 3,800 cases and
worked as advisers for more than 300 corporations and government
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Yangjim, head of the Hengfeng Law Office, which was the first
to open in Tibet, said that the law business is one of the most
significant changes in Tibet in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Dojie, a judicial official, said that, with social and economic
development, the demand for legal services has been on the rise,
and lawyers, instead of merely defending people in criminal cases,
have played an important role in economic and civil and
administrative affairs.
</P>
<P>
The law business is booming in Tibet these days, and 48 lawyers
is hardly enough to cope with the increasing number of lawsuits,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the central government, the Autonomous
Regional Judicial Department has drafted a development plan for
the business to increase the number of the lawyers here to 100 by
the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> Compaq's Earning Falls By 78 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Compaq Computer Corp. of
the United States said Wednesday that its profits in the
July-September quarter fell by 78 percent to 115 million
U.S. dollars from 517 dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
But according to the company's report, its sales jumped by 36
percent to 8.79 billion dollars from the 6.47 billion dollars the
company reported last year.
</P>
<P>
One major reason behind the fall of earnings and rise of sales,
said market analysts, is Compaq's integration recently acquired by
Digital Equipment Corp.
</P>
<P>
Compaq, the world largest personal computer manufacturer, said
it had closed six overseas plants and eliminated 5,000 jobs,
including 1,000 at its Houston headquarters as part of a
cost-cutting drive following the Digital acquisition.
</P>
<P>
"The third quarter was the first full quarter of operating the
combined companies of Compaq and Digital," Eckhard Pfeiffer,
Compaq's president and chief executive, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, Pfeiffer said his company will achieve continued
strong growth in the fourth quarter.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Briefed on Ethiopia-Eritrea Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Thursday received a message from Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi on the developing crisis on the Ethiopian-Eritrean border.
</P>
<P>
The message was delivered by Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum
Mesfin to Mubarak during their meeting which focused on the
Ethiopian-Eritrean crisis.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Mesfin told reporters that the message dealt
with the present situation between Ethiopia and Eritrea,
Egyptian-Ethiopian relations and problems facing the Horn of
Africa in general.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian top diplomat, who arrived here Thursday,
expressed regret over the present situation, noting that chances
for a peaceful settlement are still "unclear."
</P>
<P>
But he expressed hope for the mediation efforts by the
Organization of African Unity to succeed in sending proposals to
all parties next month.
</P>
<P>
Mesfin said the main objective of his visit was to discuss ways
to enhance relations between Egypt and Ethiopia and that his
meeting with the Egyptian president was a good opportunity to
exchange views on a number of major African issues of mutual
interest.
</P>
<P>
Mesfin's visit as a number of African presidents are making a
proposal for solving the Ethiopian-Eritrean border dispute.
</P>
<P>
According to African sources, the new proposal has been frowned
upon by Eritrea because it entails Asmara's pullout from Ethiopian
territory it occupied in the wake of armed clashes between the two
countries in May.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the new proposal also provides for sending an
African peacekeeping force to run the area pending negotiations
between Asmara and Addis Ababa on disputed border areas.

<HEADLINE> Romania to Export Agricultural Products to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Romania will export meat,
edible oil and corn to Russia in the hope of regaining the
important market, said Agriculture and Food Minister Dinu
Gavrilescu.
</P>
<P>
An economic mission is expected to go to Russia for talks on
the export, Gavrilescu was quoted by the country's Nine O'clock
daily as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that Romania has stockpiled for export quantities of
meat amounting to "scores of thousand tons," 100,000 tons of
export-bound edible oil and 500,000 tons of additional
corn. Besides, massive quantities of chicken and wine are also
available for export.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian market is a purely financial question and they
will probably resort to a barter for natural gas and crude oil,"
Gavrilescu said.
</P>
<P>
The situation of agriculture in Russia is reportedly rather
critical. Corn production will likely drop to 50-60 million tons
this year compared with 88.5 million tons in 1997 and 106.8
million tons in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sets Up Remittance Center for Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National Bank
(PNB) announced here Thursday that it has set up a remittance call
center to serve the needs of overseas Filipino workers and their
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
The PNB said in a statement that the remittance call center
will provide easy access and quick response to inquiries on the
status of incoming remittances.
</P>
<P>
Instead of going to PNB branches to check on the availability
of remittances, all the beneficiaries need to do now is to simply
dial the number of a hotline connected to the PNB's overseas
remittance division, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the beneficiaries will be quickly apprised by the
bank's customer service officers on the status of their expected
remittances.
</P>
<P>
The PNB advised clients not to worry about busy signal because
the hotline has a total of 10 dedicated lines. In case all these
lines are engaged, the incoming call is automatically routed to
the bank's telephone operators.
</P>
<P>
As of June this year, the PNB has processed over a million
overseas remittances valued at 1.27 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has about six million overseas workers in more
than 100 countries and regions. These workers are expected to
remit six billion U.S. dollars back to the country this year.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Govt, Opposition Agree on Transitional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho government and
opposition parties have reached an agreement on setting up a
transitional structure to oversee the upcoming elections, local
media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deal was struck after 11 hours of talks between the ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) and the opposition alliance
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
South African Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi,
who chaired the multi-party talks in Maseru, said the composition
of the structure would be decided at a later stage following
moves to legislate the formation of the body in the Lesotho
parliament this month.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the timetable agreed to, Lesotho's electoral
system would be reviewed by October 31, 1999. Its Independent
Electoral Commission would be restructured by December 31 this
year and a new code of conduct for political parties would be
reviewed by the transitional structure and the electoral
commission by March 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said the transitional structure would seek to create
and promote a climate in Lesotho that would be conducive to free
and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
The transitional body was proposed by the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) during the second round of
multi-party talks last week as the LCD and its opposition rivals
failed to agree on who should govern the country in the run-up to
fresh elections.
</P>
<P>
The opposition insisted on a government of national unity,
which the LCD firmly rejected.
</P>
<P>
Under the SADC proposal, the transitional structure would be
powerful as it would have access to information held by the
government that was relevant to the elections. It would also take
decisions on all electoral matters including the role of the
police, the military, the intelligence, finance, foreign affairs,
and media.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not clear whether all the terms were agreed to
by both sides. Mufamadi only said a task team would be set up to
define the finer workings of the body.
</P>
<P>
The LCD earlier Wednesday rejected the idea of the
transitional body, arguing that it would be unconstitutional
since its functions coincided with those of the government.
</P>
<P>
The multi-party talks came after political turmoil paralyzed
the mountain kingdom, resulting in military intervention by the
SADC last month.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Uganda's GDP Too Dependent on Foreign Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Some 60 percent of Uganda's
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is dependent on foreign aid inflows,
a situation that irks parliament members here.
</P>
<P>
Gabrel Opio, chairman of the parliamentary sessional committee
on finance and economic planning, told parliament in a recent
session of the committee that while the economy has continued to
register an overall positive trend, there is need to address
over-dependence on foreign aid, the New Vision paper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said external aid inflows account for 60 percent of
the GDP while exports make only 30 percent. About 60 percent of
the exports is dependent on export of coffee which is faced with
fluctuation of prices on the world market.
</P>
<P>
The committee recommended that the government divest "healthy"
companies directly to the public through the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested that the government and core investors in
privatized healthy enterprises should float shares on the stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
The MPs blamed the recent crisis in the local banking industry
on the laxity of top managers of the Bank of Uganda and asked the
central bank to step up its supervision role.
</P>
<P>
Absolom Ongom, a member of the committee, said the government
should persuade the majority share-holders in British-American
Tobacco to give up their preemptive rights and to cede 10
percent of their 70 percent shares to Ugandans as stipulated in
the law.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some other MPs said measures should be instituted
to ensure the quality of Ugandan coffee and that the Finance
Ministry should desist from allocating itself a lion's share of
the budget at the detriment of other government departments.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Sees Speedy Industrial Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- China's southernmost province of
Hainan recorded nearly 3.74 billion yuan in industrial added value
in the first three quarters of this year, a 7.6-percent rise from
the same 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
Provincial government officials attribute the rapid growth to
the great local effort made in recent years to restructure the
industrial framework for building the province into a new national
industrial giant.
</P>
<P>
Big changes have taken place in Hainan's industrial sector
since 1988, when the province was established and industry lagged
far behind agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The output value of the local industrial sector caught up with
that of agriculture in 1993, and topped 10 billion yuan in
1994. And local industrial added value has grown at an annual rate
of 11.3 percent in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
A group of new industries producing automobiles, motorcycles,
chemicals, textiles, pharmaceuticals and beverages are mushrooming
in the province.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has built a plant to produce 60,000 tons of polyester
chips, a mill capable of printing and dying 15 million meters of
silk, and a factory producing 1.4 million woollen blankets, all on
an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the output value of the local
automotive industry has soared 27 percent annually, while the
cement sector has risen 15.6 percent and canned foods 10.3 percent
annually.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Budget Deficit Up in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's budget deficit
increased from 39 percent in August to 46 percent in September,
the Arabic daily Al Anwar reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance said in a statement Wednesday that
expenditure in September amounted to 443.12 million U.S. dollars,
while revenues were 240 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Fouad Sinyoura, Minister of State for Financial Affairs,
explained that there were expenses which the government had to
bear last month such as the end-of-service benefits for retired
public employees.
</P>
<P>
He said that debt servicing and payments for contractors and
hospitals were also among the reasons for the growth in
government expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The government has pledged to reduce the budget deficit to 42
percent by the end of this year after over-spending by 59 percent
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
But the huge debt of 16 billion dollars has been a heavy burden
for government's efforts to achieve its goal.
</P>
<P>
The government has issued 1.45 billion dollars in eurobonds
this year as part of its plan to restructure the national debt
which is predominated by the high-interest-rate local currency.
</P>
<P>
Another 550 billion dollars in eurobonds has been approved by
the Cabinet and is expected to be issued in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Sinyoura stressed that despite the rise in expenditures in
September, the government managed to reduce the deficit from 51
percent in the first nine months of 1997 to 39 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The total revenues in the first nine months this year stood at
2.24 billion dollars and expenditures were 3.67 billion dollars,
of which 1.52 billion dollars went to debt servicing.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Govt, Opposition Agree on Transitional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho government and
opposition parties have reached an agreement on setting up a
transitional structure to oversee the upcoming elections, local
media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deal was struck after 11 hours of talks between the ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) and the opposition alliance
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
South African Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi,
who chaired the multi-party talks in Maseru, said the composition
of the structure would be decided at a later stage following
moves to legislate the formation of the body in the Lesotho
parliament this month.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the timetable agreed to, Lesotho's electoral
system would be reviewed by October 31, 1999. Its Independent
Electoral Commission would be restructured by December 31 this
year and a new code of conduct for political parties would be
reviewed by the transitional structure and the electoral
commission by March 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi said the transitional structure would seek to create
and promote a climate in Lesotho that would be conducive to free
and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
The transitional body was proposed by the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) during the second round of
multi-party talks last week as the LCD and its opposition rivals
failed to agree on who should govern the country in the run-up to
fresh elections.
</P>
<P>
The opposition insisted on a government of national unity,
which the LCD firmly rejected.
</P>
<P>
Under the SADC proposal, the transitional structure would be
powerful as it would have access to information held by the
government that was relevant to the elections. It would also take
decisions on all electoral matters including the role of the
police, the military, the intelligence, finance, foreign affairs,
and media.
</P>
<P>
However, it is not clear whether all the terms were agreed to
by both sides. Mufamadi only said a task team would be set up to
define the finer workings of the body.
</P>
<P>
The LCD earlier Wednesday rejected the idea of the
transitional body, arguing that it would be unconstitutional
since its functions coincided with those of the government.
</P>
<P>
The multi-party talks came after political turmoil paralyzed
the mountain kingdom, resulting in military intervention by the
SADC last month.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties refused to accept the results of the May 23
general election, claiming that it was rigged in favor of the
LCD, which won 79 of 80 seats in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In the first round of talks on October 2, the government and
the opposition agreed to hold fresh elections in 15 to 18 months.

<HEADLINE> Thai Officials On Single European Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Thai officials Thursday called
on the European Central Bank (ECB) to delicately balance the
priority of price stability to avoid contributing to the global
economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The call was made at a seminar on "Implications of the Single
European Currency on International Trade and Banking".
</P>
<P>
With the European single currency ready for introduction on
January 1 next year, there have been concerns that if the ECB sets
interest rates too high with an aim to curb inflation, it will
risk deepening the global recession and lead to further bank
failures.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if the rates are set too low, the ECB will
risk breaching the goal of maintaining price stability.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said at the
seminar that the dilemma the ECB is facing at this moment is the
formulation of a monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
He said financial shocks that started in 1997 represent higher
risks to the European economies and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The United States recently responded to such risks by cutting
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said that with Japan being mired in an economic
recession, the EU is the only remaining pillar that still has
breathing room to support the global economic and financial
systems. If the development taking shape outside the "economic
fortress" is ignored, knock-on effects of any global economic
slowdown may later prove to be significant.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said that as the arrival of the European single
currency draws near, Thai banks need to solve their problems
before getting ready to face a drastic change in the international
financial system.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Thai banks have already studied the euro, but
the next step is that the banks must explain to their customers
any upcoming effects of the changes," he noted.
</P>
<P>
More trading among EU member countries would not severely
effect Thailand's exports, he added.
</P>
<P>
A common currency, he said, will facilitate the broadening of
European financial markets, given that bond and equity markets
will become comparable and competitive to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
Peter Bekx, the European Commission's head of the unit for
monetary affairs, noted at the seminar that the ECB would try to
introduce the economic and financial stability both for the
European countries as well as the world.
</P>
<P>
"However, we have to realize that the main objective for the
introduction of a single currency in Europe is to facilitate the
economy among member countries in Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Michel Caillouet, head of the Delegation of the European
Commission to Thailand, said that given the economic importance of
the euro zone, the euro is likely to become an international
currency in the global trade system.
</P>
<P>
The global banking industry would face a drastic change after
the euro is put into place. Not only will it have to forego a
permanent loss of fee income and earnings from foreign exchange
dealings, but it will also face a huge one-time transaction cost
for the change-over.
</P>
<P>
According to Supachai, the negative effects from the euro
arrival would not be substantial as trading between European
countries and Thailand accounts for only 15 percent of Thailand's
total trading.

<HEADLINE> New Gold Mine Commissioned in Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry John
Rawlings has commissioned a new gold mine at Damang, the ninth to
be opened in the Western Region since 1986, the Ghana News Agency
(GNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An investment of 135 million U.S. Dollars has been injected
into the Damang Gold Mine, which is 90 percent owned by the
Perth-based Ranger Minerals and 10 percent by the Ghanaian
government over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Exploration activities started in 1989 and were initially
focused on the feasibility of retreating the tailings from the
old Abosso underground mine which was closed in 1956.
</P>
<P>
With adequate funding by public listing in 1993, drilling
continued until 1996.
</P>
<P>
Studies for a surface mining operation were carried out in
1996 and it showed that about 280,000 ounces of gold could be
produced annually which was economically viable.
</P>
<P>
Actual mining started in November 1997 and production at the
end of September, 1998 was 200,000 ounces. It is projected the
mine would produce about 300,000 ounces for 1998/99.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings expressed the hope during the commissioning ceremony
Wednesday that "great harmony and cooperation would be enforced
among the work force and management of the mine and the
communities."
</P>
<P>
"We on our part would like to assure investors, both local and
foreign, that we would persist our efforts to provide a stable
environment for their operation," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president said while mining could cause damage to the
environment, proper management could significantly reduce the
degradation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ghanaian government has decided that no new
mines would be licensed without the approval of the Environmental
Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
Prospective mining companies would be required to produce the
appropriate Environmental Impact Assessment and Environmental
Management Plan.
</P>
<P>
Mines and Energy Minister Ohene Kena said as of December 1997,
over three billion Dollars of private investment capital had been
put into the mining sector.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's focus now is to ensure that these
investments attain the maximum possible beneficial impact on the
country's economy as a whole and to sustain them "in an orderly
manner."
</P>
<P>
The government is committed to the development of all other
mineral potentials and has in line with this policy sponsored
airborne geophysical survey in some unexplored areas of the
country, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
It is the government's hope that the result of the survey
would spark investors' interest in minerals other than the
traditional ones.
</P>
<P>
Ghana is the second largest gold-producing country in Africa
after South Africa. It is also rich in other minerals such as
diamond, bauxite and manganese ore.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Zambia Trade Increases Drastically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Trade between China and Zambia
has been growing steadily in recently years with 1997 witnessing
a 140 percent increase in bilateral trade, from 15.47 million
U.S. Dollars in 1996 to 37.19 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The annual trade had hovered around 10 million Dollars in the
early 1990s and increased steadily since.
</P>
<P>
Professor He Xiankai, Economic and Commercial Counselor of
the Chinese embassy in Zambia, told Xinhua that China attaches
great importance to African market and African resources in its
bid to open more markets and to secure more resources worldwide.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 23 teams of Chinese entrepreneurs came to Zambia for
feasibility studies on business and investment. And the number
of teams increased to 33 in 1997 and this year 44 teams have
flocked to the country.
</P>
<P>
Referring to unfavorable conditions for the bilateral trade,
He said Zambia is an inland country and far from China, therefore
the cost for Chinese goods is higher than those from Zambia's
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Countries in southern and eastern Africa offer each other
favored trade conditions because they have formed regional trade
blocs.
</P>
<P>
Since China does not enjoy these favored conditions, Chinese
goods is less competitive than those of Zambia's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
However, Zambia's opening and privatization policies offers a
lot of opportunities and it needs funds and technologies.
</P>
<P>
He urged Chinese companies to promote trade by injecting more
investments into Zambia, producing and processing products and
assembling machines before selling them locally or for export.
</P>
<P>
Chinese companies running factories and mines in Zambia can
import production equipment from China free of import duty, thus
enhancing trade with Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has abundant agricultural resources such as land and
water and its climate is suitable for a variety of crops. To
encourage agricultural production the government imposes no tax.
Some Chinese farms perform very well in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chinese firms can undertake projects such as building or
rehabilitating schools, clinics and paving roads. The projects
undertaken by the Chinese firms will exceed 20 million Dollars
this year alone.
</P>
<P>
There is great room for Chinese firms to give a full play, He
concluded.

<HEADLINE> China faces Grave Environmental Situation: Li Peng (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUILIN, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Top Chinese lawmaker Li Peng
today described China's environmental situation as "extremely
grim" and said the country faces the arduous task of protecting
environment and natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The tremendous pressure on natural resources and the
environment comes mainly from population growth, said Li, chairman
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, at
the 6th General Assembly of the Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians'
Conference on Environment Protection and Development that opened
here today.
</P>
<P>
Despite government endeavors in population growth control,
China still has an increase of about 13 million people each
year. Official estimates put total population in China at 1.3
billion by year 2,000.
</P>
<P>
Li reviewed the flood-fighting and relief efforts in China this
summer and said the main reason for the occurrence of serious
floods is an abnormal climate, especially intense rainfall and
huge precipitation.
</P>
<P>
"China's capabilities in combating floods and waterlogging are
not strong and there are many problems awaiting solutions," Li
said, adding the Chinese government will give top priority to
harnessing rivers and lakes, undertaking water conservancy
projects, planting trees and grasses and reducing soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
All these tasks were outlined by president Jiang Zemin
in his speech at the recent national conference for
commending flood-fighting heros, which will help raise China's
capability to prevent floods, fight natural disasters and improve
the quality of the ecological environment, Li said.

environment, natural resources and sustainable development of
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Li said in the area of environment and development, all
countries in the Asia-Pacific region share common long-range goals
and common interests. The parliaments, governments and
non-governmental organizations of all countries can accomplish
much in the field.
</P>
<P>
The National People's Congress greatly appreciates the
exchanges and cooperation between parliaments and people of all
countries in the region in promoting the cause of environmental
protection since the the Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians' Conference
on Environment and Development was initiated five years ago, Li
said.

He hoped the conference would continue to play a greater role
as a bond and bridge between and as a forum for exchanges between

broke out across Lebanon this week, the government decided to form
a ministerial committee to handle the situation.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star newspaper reported Thursday that the cabinet
made the decision on Wednesday and appointed Deputy Prime Minister
and Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr to head the committee which
comprises ministers of defense, agriculture and environment.
</P>
<P>
The committee will report fires to the cabinet and study
fire-fighting mechanism, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision came when the country's northern,
central and southern mountainous and coastal areas have been hit
by blazes.
</P>
<P>
Civil defense figures have shown that 68 fires broke out on
Sunday, 87 on Monday and 125 on Tuesday, leaving at least 11 civil
defense personnel wounded and 1.75 million square meters of
orchards and forest damaged.
</P>
<P>
The meteorological department said the dry and windy weather
was the main reason behind the fires.
</P>
<P>
But politicians and farmers blamed the quickly spreading fires
on the government's negligence and severe shortage of fire
fighting equipment.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Receives $18m Loan From China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Ghana will receive a loan of
18 million U.S. Dollars from China to further promote economic
and technical cooperation between the two countries, the Ghana
News Agency (GNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed in Accra Wednesday by Victor
Selormey, a Deputy Minister of Finance and Yang Zhengchi, chief
representative of Eximbank, the loan will be used to finance
joint venture projects and would be administered by Eximbank of
China.
</P>
<P>
Ghana, according to the pact, will have 15 years to pay back
the loan, which attracts an interest of three point five per cent
per annum, including three years grace period.
</P>
<P>
Two supplementary loan accords of six million Dollars for gold
mining and 8.7 million Dollars for cocoa processing were also
sealed.
</P>
<P>
Selormey described the loan as concessional because the
Chinese government has subsidized the "generally high interest"
of such Eximbank loans.
</P>
<P>
He said bilateral relations with the Chinese date back to the
pre-independence era and that "these relations have been cordial
since then."
</P>
<P>
Eximbank, which was established in 1994, will continue to
offer support to Ghana in its efforts to achieve economic
prosperity, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Ghana has received about 30 million Dollars interest-free
loans from the Chinese government since 1972.
</P>
<P>
Some of the projects that have benefited from the loans
include the National Theater, Juapong Cotton and Textile Factory
and Afife Irrigation Project.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Ghana is to hold the second
Ghana International Tourism Fair from September 24 to October 3,
1999, the Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Wednesday by Ghanaian Minister of Tourism
Mike Gizo in the capital Accra.
</P>
<P>
The fair which seeks to bring together players and
facilitators in the industry will run on the theme "Vision 2020,
Ghana the tourism gateway to Africa".
</P>
<P>
It is aimed primarily at portraying and promoting Ghana's
culture as the major tourist attraction to the foreigner in the
context of Vision 2020, the national development strategy.
</P>
<P>
"We must endeavor to give it a truly international character
which transcends the borders of the sub-region and the African
region at large," said Gizo.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, mobilization of resources necessary
to carry out specific tasks on schedule and marketing of events
must all be professionally handled by competent and dynamic
organizations and fully monitored.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that Ghana will also host the 1999 Africa
Travel Association Congress to be held in Accra from May 3 to 8.
</P>
<P>
"The principal challenge to us now is how fully prepared we
are to cope with the influx in terms of infrastructure and
tourist demand for services and thereby demonstrate also our
ability to handle an anticipated larger turnout for Emancipation
Day."
</P>
<P>
He called on local investors to invest in the tourist industry
since it is the most viable place for making money.
</P>
<P>
Ghana is ranked among the top 20 tourism destinations in
Africa. The first Ghana International Tourism Fair organized by
the Ghana Tourist Board was held in Accra in 1986.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- In a major decision, India
agreed to abide by the Paris convention for the protection of
industrial property and the patent cooperation treaty, a financial
daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Express said both treaties, considered as main
records regarding international protection of intellectual
property, would be binding on India as of December 7.
</P>
<P>
The Paris convention lays down the basic principles governing
protection of patents, trademarks and industrial designs while the
patent cooperation treaty makes it possible to fill out a single
application for a patent that will be valid in several countries,
reducing costs and paperwork.
</P>
<P>
The decision was welcomed by patent lawyers, India's trading
partners and the United Nations alike Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
India has claimed biopiracy in a case involving a patent
granted to a company in the United States for rice similar to
India's famous Basmati grain.
</P>
<P>
A controversy broke out recently between India and Britain over
patent of a nearly extinct Indian cattle breed called "Vechur
cow".
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Roslin Institute of Scotland, which
produced the world's first cloned sheep "dolly", has applied for
the patent rights to the genetic material of this rare cow, which
India said draws its name from Vechur, a village in its
southwestern state of Kerala.

DAR ES SALAAM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will get 200
megawatts of power supplies from the neighboring Zambia under a
153 million U.S. Dollars agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed between the state-owned Tanzania
Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) and its counterpart Zambia
Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO), offers to build a
700-kilometer 330-kv transmission line in three years.
</P>
<P>
According to Tanzanian newspapers Thursday, the line will
extend from Zambia's Serenje to Tanzania's Mbeya Region in the

The project, whose feasibility study took four years, will
further enable TANESCO to fully participate in the Southern
African Power Pool which aims to create a common market for
electricity in the 14-nation Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC).

<HEADLINE> Highest Science Body Supports Backward Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- China's highest scientific
research institute announced today that it will support the
underdeveloped Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region with the most
advanced high technologies.
</P>
<P>
"While organizing our elite experts to focus on the most
sophisticated frontiers of modern science, the academy will
mobilize the major force to help develop the national and regional
economy," said Lu Yongxiang, president of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia's economy consists mainly of farming, animal
husbandry and mining.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, the CAS has established observatories for
surveying the natural resources and ecological environment of the
region.
</P>
<P>
"We should further develop our cooperation with the region in
the field of scientific upgrading," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to its long-term research on the agriculture, ecology
and the environment of the region, the CAS will provide
decision-makers with its development projects.
</P>
<P>
The technology will include support for harnessing the desert
and improving farming and mineral exploitation.

China's highest authorities recently decided to invigorate
agriculture through science and technology and earnestly protect
natural resources and the environment.

<P>
SHENZHEN, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Believe it or not. Local
researchers have found that China's first stock had no legal
basis. But nobody would say it was illegal, because there was
absolutely no law governing this field at the time the stock was
issued.
</P>
<P>
It was 1982, just two years after Shenzhen was severed from
Bao'an County in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The money-tight county government of Bao'an, which borders a
capitalist Hong Kong, was pondering the idea of learning something
about fund-raising from its rich neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Hu Yaobang, then general secretary of the Communist Party of
China (CPC), agreed with the county leaders.
</P>
<P>
"I propose to raise the point among the people," Hu said,
"that on the one hand, the government lacks funds for development,
and on the other hand, the people have the money to invest. Why
not bring the two together?"
</P>
<P>
In November 1982, the country government established an
investment firm, the Bao'an County Joint Investment Company, with
capital of 200,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In July 1983, the county government allowed the company to sell
shares nationwide. On July 8, the company followed Hong Kong's
model of joint-stock firms and set up a shareholders congress
and board of directors.
</P>
<P>
The new-born publicly held company had its certificates of
shareholding rights printed at a local printing house in
Guangzhou, the provincial capital, by using samples from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
On July 25, the company published an ad in a local newspaper
inviting investors, though the stock issue had received no
approval from the central government, and the government itself
had little knowledge about stocks, something deemed by many as the
very essence of capitalism.

<HEADLINE> Jingye Cradle of Top Swimmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- You may call it the national
team, but half of its members come from one place -- Shanghai
Jingye High School.
</P>
<P>
The 24-member Chinese swimming team, who are competing in the
International Schoolsports Federation (ISF) World Gymnasiade
here, have 12 swimmers from the Jingye, who made a big splash
after winning four out of eight gold medals in the first day's
competitions.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth time that Jingye has been commissioned by
the State Education Ministry to organize a national High Shcool
Students Swimming Delegation to take part in the ISF World
Gymnasiade.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, Jingye has been the training base for the Chinese
student swimmers preparing for the ISF World Gymnysiade and the
World High School Students Swimming contest. The delegations
have won a total of 20 gold medals, 12 silvers and eight bronzes.
</P>
<P>
Jingye has a history of 250 years while its student swimming
team was founded more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The school gets its name from the old Chinese idiom "Jing Ye
Le Qun", which means respecting work and enjoying company. The
idiom has served as the school's motto.
</P>
<P>
Although this oldest high school in Shanghai has been famous
for its academic accomplishments since its establishment in 1784,
the school has always attached an importance to physical exercise
and sports. The school has become distinguished with swimming
since the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
"The school set up its swimming team then and never stopped
training," said Qian Guoguang, head coach of the Jingye swimming
team. "We are pround that swimming becomes a traditional sport of
our school."
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Education Bureau named Jingye as an experimental
school for nuturing a high-level student swimming team in 1986.
Since then, Jingye has increased its efforts to develop the sport
and improve the team's records.
</P>
<P>
The team selects student athletes from all districts and
counties of the city, most of whom have started training since
childhood.
</P>
<P>
The team has a special coaching group which involves
professional coaches from the Shanghai Sports Education College
and the Shanghai's swimming team. The school asked all teachers
help student athletes make up missed classes.
</P>
<P>
"All of our young athletes are fond of swimming and they hold
a clear goal when they enter the school: to improve their
swimming skills while completing the high school education," Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
"The school throws all its weight behind the team wherever
possible. In this way, our swimming team grows up with satisfying
performances."
</P>
<P>
In five National Juniors Swimming Contests held from 1996 to
1998, team members have won a total of 43 gold medals, 17 silvers
and 11 bronzes. Over 20 students have been chosen for the
national and Shanghai swimming teams.
</P>
<P>
"As well as focusing on young champions, our school is also
dedicated to promoting the sport of swimming," Qian said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Soon, this first stock issued on the Chinese mainland since
1949 attracted investors from over 20 inland provinces and
municipalities as well as from Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The first issue raised more than 13 million yuan, including two
million yuan in shares held by the State, 1.6 million yuan shares
bought by companies, and 9.4 million yuan shares purchased by
individual investors.
</P>
<P>
On June 25, 1991 Shenzhen Bao'an caused a stir when it was
listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange with the code number
No.009. The stock pocketed 225 million yuan from the sale, and it
became the largest listed company in the country, then accounting
for 43 percent of the total volume of shares on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
In the following years, Shenzhen Bao'an continued to draw great
attention from Chinese investors.
</P>
<P>
The company is the country's first issuer of convertible bonds and
medium- and long-term certificates of share-purchasing rights.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the Bao'an Group stunned the country by buying 19.8
percent of the Yanzhong company's shares on the Shanghai Stock
Exchange, which was the country's first successful take-over of a
publicly held firm through the purchase of stock.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the group has a controlling interest in three local
joint-stock firms, while holding shares in 30 listed companies. It
is also the second largest stockholder in six other listed
companies.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the legendary company boasted total
assets of 5.64 billion yuan, compared with 200,000 yuan 15 years
ago. It has also paid 336 million yuan in pre-tax profits to the
government.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Mortgage Rates at 28-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Banks in New Zealand have
dropped floating mortgage rates to their lowest in 28 years,
providing thousands of home owners with a timely cash bonus before
Christmas, a local newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion said all the main lenders slashed their floating
rates by one percent to 6.95 percent Wednesday, the first time
variable rates have fallen below seven percent since December
1970, according to Reserve Bank (central bank) records.
</P>
<P>
The floating mortgage rate cuts, which take effect for present
borrowers next month, will reduce repayments on a 100,000 NZ
dollar (54,000 U.S. dollar), 20-year mortgage by 61 NZ dollars (33
U.S. dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
"The sharp decline in mortgage rates this year is part of the
Reserve Bank's medicine for the ailing economy. The bank has eased
monetary conditions in an attempt to stimulate economic growth,"
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Just half a year ago, local floating mortgage rates reached
11.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
But though lower mortgage bills are a tonic for borrowers,
savers have less to cheer about. Local deposit rates have also
dropped by about four percent in the past three months, almost
halving the interest investors earn.

<HEADLINE> Undersea Volcano Project Ends in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A joint New Zealand and
German scientific research project studying underwater volcanoes
north of New Zealand wound up in Wellington Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post, a Wellington-based newspaper, said that the
German research vessel Sonne berthed in Wellington Thursday after
a five-week, 2.5 million NZ dollar (1.35 million U.S. dollar)
expedition which used a submersible to video and collect samples
from the seabed.
</P>
<P>
Joint chief scientist Dr. Ian Wright was quoted as saying that
it was hoped the project would aid understanding of the make-up
and operation of undersea volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
Scientists explored a series of undersea volcanoes and carried
out rock sampling along the South Pacific "Ring of Fire" between
Tonga and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The submersible completed three dives to depths of 190 meters
and took the first gas and water samples of volcanic seafloor
vents. It was discovered that vent sites coincided with active
seafloor fault lines, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Tamil Rebels Halt Court Proceedings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Threats by the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have resulted in the indefinite
suspension of the five courts of law in Jaffna city, according to
reports reaching here from Sri Lanka's north.
</P>
<P>
Members of the judiciary, lawyers and officials attached to the
courts Tuesday unanimously decided to keep away from official
duties as their lives were under threat, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, work at the Jaffna, Mallakam, Point Pedro,
Chavakachcheri and Kayts courts have come to a complete
standstill.
</P>
<P>
Warning letters signed by "Thoovayan" describing himself as the
"Organizer of the Tamil Eelam Administrative Services" have been
received by members of the judiciary instructing them to cease
official duties from that day, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile all members of the 17 local bodies in the Jaffna
Peninsula in the north of Sri Lanka have also been threatened with
death by the LTTE calling on them to resign.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has followed up earlier death threats by killing two
mayors of Jaffna, Sarojini Yogeswarana and Ponniah Sivapalan, and
the chairman of the Karaveddi Area Council, Kangasabapathy
Rajathurai.
</P>
<P>
The members of 17 local bodies were elected as representatives
democratically by the people of the peninsula in the polls held on
January 29 this year. But the LTTE rejected the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Jaffna Peninsula had been the stronghold of the LTTE rebels
before it was lost to the government forces in May 1996. The LTTE
rebels have been fighting the government since 1983 for a separate
state in the north and east of the island country.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Expects One Percent Economic Growth in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has projected an
economic growth of 1.0 percent next year against the forecast 4.8
percent negative growth for this year.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that our economy will grow by 1.0 percent (next
year) although for this year we will have a negative growth of 4.8
percent. This means we will have a turnaround of 5.8 percent,"
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The government would adopt a deficit budget for 1999, Mahathir,
who is the first finance minister, told reporters after he
explained the nation's financial situation and the strategy for
the 1999 budget at the Parliament Pre-Council meeting here.
</P>
<P>
"It is certain that the 1999 budget will be influenced by the
unhealthy economic situation and we will have a deficit budget for
next year," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said the government was planning to improve the
financial position of the country and intensify the economic
recovery measures through monetary and fiscal measures.
</P>
<P>
"The budgetary measures are designed to stimulate the economy.
So some tax measures will be introduced but mainly it is in the
fiscal policies that are going to contribute towards stimulating
economic growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 budget is expected to be presented by Mahathir in
Parliament on October 23.

<HEADLINE> Most Chinese Teenagers Disapprove of Extramarital Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey reveals that
though Chinese adults have become more tolerant of extramarital
sex, most teenagers are still against such behavior.
</P>
<P>
About 8,000 people including quite a number of students have
expressed their attitudes towards marriage and sexual relations
generally through an Internet survey conducted by the Horizon
polling company.
</P>
<P>
Adopting concubines and calling on prostitutes are considered
the worst sexual activities by people surveyed, but they seem to
be more tolerant of extramarital affairs, cohabitation and sex
before marriage.
</P>
<P>
A smaller proportion of people below the age of 20 are tolerant
of these activities than their elders, according to the survey,
and some even believe that infidelity should be against the law.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that three-fifths of the teenagers agreed that
people who destroy others people's marriages by having an affair
should be punished either financially or by other means, while 70
percent of people aged between 37 and 45 do not think there should
be any punishment for such activities.
</P>
<P>
About two-thirds of the teenagers surveyed believe there can be
pure friendship between men and women, a much larger proportion
than that of people in other age groups, but very few teenagers
said they would accept "Platonic love," or love between men and
women without any sexual contact, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Experts say these results demonstrate that most teenagers are
still following traditional concepts of marriage and sex, and this
may ease the minds of those who think that Chinese youngsters are
being influenced by some negative aspects of modern society.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Launches Project to Fight "Hidden Drought" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi Ministry of
Agriculture has taken up a 3-year project to address the problem
of "hidden drought" faced by 2.8 million hectares of rain-fed
rice-growing fields in post-monsoon season every year.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Agricultural Secretary A.M.M. Shawkat Ali
Wednesday, The Independent newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will cost 1.15 billion taka (24.5 million
U.S. dollars), involves extending input support to farmers for
supplementary irrigation to overcome the problem.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Meteorological Department has been asked to
develop further its agro-meteorological forecasts with a view to
guiding farmers about what they should do when they face the
"hidden drought".
</P>
<P>
The Space Research and Remote Sensing Organization has been
asked to conduct a research on the effects of El Nino and La Nina
weather phenomena on agriculture, and the research work in this
regard is expected to start soon.
</P>
<P>
About 30 percent of rain-fed rice yields is affected by the
"hidden drought" every year on average, and this kind of rice
accounts for about half of the annual rice output, according to
the agricultural secretary.
</P>
<P>
The 2.8 million hectares of rain-fed rice fields that face the
"hidden drought" are located in the northwestern and southwestern
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 2.18 billion taka (46.4 million dollars)
supplementary irrigation project taken up for the current year is
being scaled down because there has so far been no water stress
because of the lingering floods.
</P>
<P>
The project has been taken on the basis of the 1987 experience
of a severe post-monsoon drought that was considered as an effect
of El Nino, periodic warming of the Pacific waters that affect the
global weather.

BANGKOK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Thailand kicked off three days
of sports events Thursday to test the facilities of the 13th
Asian Games scheduled for December 6-20.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from some 10 Thai sports associations will
compete in the pre-games in three major sports complexes in
Bangkok, Pattaya and Nakhon Sawan Province.
</P>
<P>
The games aim to test the sports facilities, none of which are
yet complete, in addition to the telecommunications, security and
traffic control provisions.
</P>
<P>
Competitors will take part in athletics, swimming, boxing,
gymnastics, tennis, shooting, cycling, canoeing, rowing,
widsurfing and soccer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Sports Authority of Thailand (SAT) has begun
drug tests on national athletes.
</P>
<P>
"The team will test 50 athletes from 10 sports that are known
to lure athletes to use dope," Dr Chaturaporn Na Nakorn, head of
the Sports Science Center of Thailand, said.
</P>
<P>
The testing is intented as a preventive measure to keep some
800 Thai athletes away from doping, said Chaturaporn. It will
also serve as a test run for procedures to be used during the
games.
</P>
<P>
The SAT specifically requested that 1994 Olympic boxing gold
medallist Somluck Khamsing be tested, Chaturaporn said.
</P>
<P>
No suspicions have been raised about Somluck. But ensuring
that he is drug-free now would avoid any possible embarrassment
at the games.
</P>
<P>
The inspection team will drop by training centers without
notifying athletes ahead of time, he added.
</P>
<P>
Test result will be submitted to the Olympic Committee of
Thailand, which makes the final decision on which athletes will
represent the country.

HANGZHOU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The sea level along the coast
of east China's Zhejiang Province has been rising steadily in
recent years, prompting oceanographers to deepen their research
into this change in a bid to prevent the province from possible
disaster.
</P>
<P>
Data collected from twelve sea-wave sample sites indicates the
sea level has risen more than 20 centimeters in the last four
decades, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
A rapid rise in the sea level could increase the incidence of
typhoons and lead to serious port and dike damage. Zhejiang
Province has the country's longest coastal line and bountiful
ocean resources, almost two-thirds of the province's production
is concentrated in the coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
If the sea level rises by 30 centimeters, the province could
suffer economic losses of more than one billion yuan (about 120
million U.S. dollars), according to experts.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Enroll More Students From China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Thursday decided
to increase the quota for students from the People's Republic of
China from the current 1,000 to 4,000 places each year.
</P>
<P>
Observers here are of the view that the increase of the quota
is purely for earning money and hunting talents.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Minister of Immigration Tuariki John Delamere,
while announcing the decision, said this increase is expected to
provide a net benefit of about 30 million NZ dollars (16.2 million
U.S. dollars) in New Zealand's international student sales and
benefit a wide range of education providers in secondary, tertiary
and English language training institutions in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to him, one student in New Zealand for 12 months will
spend approximately 20,000 NZ dollars (10,800 U.S. dollars) in
tuition fees and living expenses.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in the quota is also a real opportunity for
students from the People's Republic of China to develop a pathway
to residence by studying in New Zealand," Delamere added.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, he also announced the decision to allow
foreign students to work for up to 15 hours a week during
term-time to replace the current stipulation of only allowing them
to work during the Christmas vacation.
</P>
<P>
"Working part-time is an important factor for foreign students
choosing where to study," he explained.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 7,500 foreign students studying in New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"We do want to be certain that the benefits to the economy will
outweigh any costs, so we have asked Work and Income NZ to monitor
any impact of foreign students on the labor market and report to
the government on this," Delamere said.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Good Grain Harvest This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite heavy summer flooding,
China is expected to harvest 492.5 billion kg of grain this year,
roughly the same as last year's output, the Ministry of
Agriculture said today.
</P>
<P>
The harvest of cotton is predicted at 1.6 million kg this year,
though the acreage sown to the crop had been reduced, said the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The annual output of autumn oil-bearing crops is expected to
surpass that of last year, though oil-bearing crops harvested this
summer was greatly reduced.
</P>
<P>
Sugar-bearing crops, vegetables, fruits, tea and silkworm
cocoons also are expected to have good harvests.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributes the anticipated good harvest to the
application of modern agricultural techniques and a higher rate of
mechanization.

<HEADLINE> India Takes Steps to Curb Crime, Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government decided
Wednesday to set up a special task force to evolve and implement a
plan of action to tackle inter-state crime and terrorism in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during a marathon meeting of chief
ministers of eight northern states and Union Home Minister L. K.
Advani, the Hindu daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed to monitor and audit external funding to
non-governmental organizations working in various areas of the
country, a move clearly aimed at checking the possibility of
funding by foreign agencies to carry out subversive activities.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also suggested that central government make
stringent laws for driving license and passports.
</P>
<P>
Advani informed the chief ministers of the magnitude and extent
of damage caused by terrorism in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Hindu said that the Indian government had spent 460 billion
rupees (about 11.5 billion U.S. dollars) on army and para-military
forces deployed on internal security duty and other security
related expenses mounted to 1850 billion rupees (about 4.625
billion U.S. dollars), mainly account of compensation to victims,
border fencing and raising of counter-terrorist forces.
</P>
<P>
As many as 34,252 people have been killed and public and
private property worth over 20 billion rupees (500 million U.S.
dollars) has been damaged by terrorist activities, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the meeting, Advani urged chief ministers of
the northern states to take effective measures for early disposal
of court cases.
</P>
<P>
It is significant that the meeting was held just one day before
the resumption of talks between India and Pakistan in Islamabad,
during which India will focus on trans-border terrorist activities
especially in Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Restaurant Cited For Serving Giant Lizard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A restaurant in southwest
China's Yunnan Province is facing penalties after it was
discovered they have been serving wild giant lizards, according to
today's Beijing Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
The police in the city of Baoshan recently received a report
from local residents that a restaurant on Baoxiu West Road was
serving giant lizards that enjoy first-class government protection.
</P>
<P>
As part of their investigation, police officers called the
restaurant and pretended to order a banquet. During the bargaining
they were told that the restaurant had a special dish--chicken and
lizard soup.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, plainclothes policemen came to the restaurant
and asked to see if the giant lizard was fresh or not. The owner
of the restaurant, Hao Huijie, then proceeded to take two
prepeared giant lizards out of the ice box.
</P>
<P>
Policemen had caught the restaurant redhanded, and confiscated
the giant lizards on the spot. After careful examination,
specialist confirmed they were indeed the wild giant lizards.

</P>
<P>
It was the second time for the new Brazilian national team to

<HEADLINE> Committee Chairman May ``Streamline'' Impeachment Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers from the White House
and the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives
will meet next week for the first time to discuss the impeachment
inquiry regarding President Bill Clinton's conduct.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Committee Chairman Henry Hyde is reportedly
considering trimming back the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Paul McNulty, a spokesman for the committee, said Wednesday the
panel's lawyers would invite White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff
to provide "exculpatory information."
</P>
<P>
The session next Tuesday will cover how the House and the White
House could "work together to expedite the process," McNulty said.
</P>
<P>
Hyde, a Republican, said he may reduce the number of
allegations against Clinton in order to finish the panel's work by
the end of the year and recommend whether or not the House should
begin impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Allegations against Clinton may have to be reduced if the
inquiry is to meet the December 31 deadline imposed by Hyde.
</P>
<P>
Republicans postponed on Wednesday the only impeachment-related
hearing scheduled prior to the election, an October 22
Constitutional subcommittee session at which scholars were to
testify on historical standards for removal from office. Since the
House has remained in session longer than expected this year,
lawmakers did not want to interrupt their campaigns to return for
the hearing, Republican officials said.
</P>
<P>
Representative Bobby Scott, a Democrat and ranking Democrat on
the Constitution subcommittee, said if Republicans really want to
streamline the inquiry, they would hold the hearing on schedule.
And the Judiciary Committee could determine standards for
impeachment and decide whether the allegations meet those
standards.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Hyde said the committee would "focus on
the core charges against the president of lying under oath,
obstruction of justice and witness tampering." Chief committee
investigator David Schippers has prepared 15 "substantial and
credible" grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Republicans won a bitterly partisan 258-176 vote
to authorize an investigation without limits on subject matter or
time.
</P>
<P>
The new poll released Wednesday by CNN, USA Today and the
Gallup organization, indicates that 55 percent of likely voters
disapprove of the way Republicans are handling the current
investigation, while 43 percent approve.
</P>
<P>
A majority of likely voters, 54 percent, favors holding
impeachment hearings, although they oppose an impeachment trial or
Clinton's ouster.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 1,004 adults was taken Friday through Monday.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- As many as 60 members of a
cult, whose leader prophesied Denver would be destroyed,
disappeared more than two weeks ago, a cult monitoring group said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A news report from Denver said those who disappeared were
members of Concerned Christians. They abandoned their homes and
jobs to follow their charismatic leader Monte Kim Miller, 44, said
Hal Mansfield, director of the Religious Movement Resource Center.
</P>
<P>
Family members have been calling. They are worried and have not
heard from their missing relatives. They said the members were
fleeing Denver because Miller prophesied the city would be
``ground zero'' for an apocalyptic disaster last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Miller, who founded Concerned Christians, is suspected of
leading the group to either Jerusalem or Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Miller's empty home in southeast Denver is for sale. He and his
wife, Marcia, declared bankruptcy a year ago, owing more than
600,000 U.S. dollars, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Calls for Int'l Cooperation to Tackle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina has called for international cooperation and initiative to
tackle natural disaster, English newspapers here reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
She made the call Wednesday while addressing the inaugural
function on International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction
Day '98 in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Different countries might be the victims of the same disaster
simultaneously as this year's devastating floods in China, Nepal,
India and South Korea at the same time, she observed.
</P>
<P>
Her government is thinking of preparing and implementing
development programs to cope with natural disasters, the prime
minister said. "For this, we are going to prepare far-reaching
programs."
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is a natural disaster-prone country, and quite often
heavy loss of life and properties are caused by natural disasters
like cyclone, tidal surge, flood, river erosion, drought and
earthquake, Hasina told the function.
</P>
<P>
"It is humanly impossible to prevent natural disasters
totally," she said, adding that it is necessary to make the
structural reform and development on the one hand and wide
publicity about disaster on the other.
</P>
<P>
With the coordination of these two, it is possible to reduce to
a great extent the loss and damages caused by disaster, Hasina
stressed. Side by side with the government initiatives,
cooperation and all-out efforts of the mass media is important in
this regard, she stated.
</P>
<P>
"We've ensured all-out and effective use of our mass media in
reducing the havoc caused by natural disasters," the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
About the far-reaching programs, she stressed the need for
dredging of rivers, saying "dredging of our big rivers will be
made to reduce the probabilities of flood as well as to increase
their navigability".
</P>
<P>
The government buildings like schools, colleges and hospitals
would be built in such way that they could be used as flood and
cyclone shelters in flood-and cyclone-prone areas of the country,
Hasina said, adding that the height of highways and roads would
also be raised from the present level.
</P>
<P>
She said that the government had decided to construct an
embankment to keep the capital city of Dhaka free from flooding.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the government was planning to take initiative to
plant such variety of paddy and crops that could be able to grow
up higher with the rise of flood water, the prime minister added.

refueling.
</P>
<P>
Its sister ship mv Kengtung and two other 440-seat passenger

BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The construction of exhibition
halls and the preparation of exhibits for the '99 Kunming World
Garden-Art Fair will be completed by the end of next March,
according to the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA).
</P>

<HEADLINE> Free Visits to Scenic Spots for Teachers in Zhejiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting scenic spots and
museums without buying tickets -- what a sweet dream for
travellers! Now more than 100,000 teachers in east China's
Zhejiang Province will enjoy this privilege.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial People's Congress recently passed a regulation
which offers free visits for teachers to parks and museums.
</P>
<P>
Teachers who have taught in the province for at least 30 years
and have received honorary certificates from the provincial
government will be able to visit any scenic spot or museum in
Zhejiang free of charge.
</P>

Zhejiang has scenic spots covering an area of 3,500 square
kilometers, ranking first in China. It has more than 100 museums
including the China Silk Museum, the China Tea Museum and the
Hemudu Site Museum.
</P>
<P>
"To have a view of Zhejiang's wonderful sights is my
long-cherished wish," said Xie Guangtian, head of the Hangzhou
Teachers College. Xie's family is regarded as "the home of
teachers," since three of the six teachers of his family have
received certificates.
</P>
<P>
"Free visits also show a trend toward holding teachers in
great esteem and attaching great importance to education," said
Xie.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 teachers in Zhejiang have at least 30 year's
teaching experience, and to date about 50,000 of them have been

<HEADLINE> Thai Currency Still Competitive: Bank Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Thailand Governor
Chatumongol Sonakul has said that Thailand's export
competitiveness is still acceptable despite the fact the baht
value is strengthening.
</P>
<P>
"The baht, although making strong gains recently, remains
competitively priced against other currencies," the governor said
in remarks published by Thursday's Nation newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the competitiveness level is still in a range
suggested earlier by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
regarding the devaluation of the Thai currency.
</P>
<P>
Calculation of export competitiveness is based on a study
comparing exports of 22 countries. Inflation, exchange rate and
export goods of each country are taken into account to gauge the
competitiveness against each other. The study does not exclude
Japan, which competes with Thailand in trade.
</P>
<P>
So far, the baht has continued to escalate against the
greenback on the back of the Japanese yen's rally. Baht ended on
Wednesday at 38.10 to the U.S. dollar from Tuesday's finish of
38.25.
</P>
<P>
The real effective exchange rate reached the highest level at
37.06 percent in late January as the baht hovered around 57 to the
dollar. But the baht had then risen against the greenback, leading
the country's export competitiveness to hit the lowest level at
12.46 percent as of September 30.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol said the central bank will allow the dollar/baht
exchange rates to move in line with the market mechanism.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to force the baht to weaken (to boost exports),
but the most important thing is to improve efficiency in various
sectors such as production, exports, agriculture and industrial,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"That will certainly raise the country's export
competitiveness in the long run," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chatumongol said the bank may intervene to prevent rapid
changes in the value of the baht, given that the central bank does
not want it to dramatically change in the short-term.
</P>
<P>
He said the central bank continues to monitor the movement of
the baht in order to ensure that it remains at a competitive
level.

HAVANA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States isolation in
pursuing its policy to Cuba has grown as 157 members of the
U.N. General Assembly voted for a resolution calling for
Washington to repeal its embargo, Cuba said Wednesday.

<P>
Gonzalez said that the U.S. policy violates human rights and
the basic rule of respecting other independent states.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have been aware of the adverse impact of the
policy. The nearly four-decade long U.S. blockade has brought
damages not only to Cuba, but to the international stability as
well, Gonzalez said.

<HEADLINE> Biotechnology Provides New Opportunities for Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Rapid advances in molecular
genetics, computing and information technology will dramatically
transform global agriculture in the 21st century and provide new
opportunities, particularly for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
An independent panel of international experts made the
prediction in its assessment report on the work of the
Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research.
</P>
<P>
The panel consists of experts from the United States, Japan,
Germany, South Africa, Britain and India.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 840 million people, mostly women and
children, were hungry today, and that the world's population would
rise by three billion by the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
Therefore global efforts should be made to harness
biotechnology to meet the needs of people and the environment.
</P>
<P>
The world was at cusp of a new scientific revolution in the
biological science. Breakthroughs included food crops with higher
yields and nutrition content, plants resistant to drought and
pests, livestock immune to disease, and sustainable fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The experts predicted that key contributions of biotechnology
could include:
</P>
<P>
-- higher food production without expanding farmland into
wilderness, rain forest or marginal lands that support
biodiversity and vital ecosystem services.
</P>
<P>
-- reducing post-harvest loss of food and improving the quality of
fresh and processed foods, thus boosting the "realized nutritional
yield" per acre.
</P>
<P>
-- displacing resource-and energy-intensive input, such as
fuel, fertilizers, or pesticides, thus reducing unintended impacts
on the environment and freeing those resources for other purposes
or conserved for the future.
</P>
<P>
-- encouraging the reduction of environmentally damaging
agricultural practices and adoption of more sustainable methods,
such as conservation tillage, precision agriculture, and
integrated crop management.
</P>
<P>
The private sector was investing enormous sums in biotechnology
research, nine billion U.S. dollars in 1997 in the United States
alone, the report said.

<HEADLINE> CFA Suspends Coaches from Team Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Football
Association (CFA) on Wednesday handed out the severest punishment
since the professional league was launched in the year 1994,
suspending two second division coaches from any team activities
for "play passive games".
</P>
<P>
Chen Yiming, coach of Chongqing Hongyan, and Wang Hongli,
manager at Liaoning Tianrun, were immediately revoked of coaching
licence because they "had inescapable responsibility for the
consequences" of the 21st round second division league matches
last weekend which "had extremely nasty implications", CFA
vice-president Nanyong said.
</P>
<P>
Hongyan, the third-placed side but already out of the
promotion race, was thumped by relegation-treatened Yunnan Hongta
4-0 while Tianrun, who had secured their top flight spot with two
games remaining, went down 4-2 to Chengdu Wuniu, the side they
stuffed a total of 17 goals in their three encounters this year.
</P>
<P>
The two clubs were each fined 50,000 RMB.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tianrun club sacked Wang immediately after the
CFA announcement.
</P>
<P>
CFA made the decision among rampant media accusations that
match-fixing scandals have gripped and ripped the Chinese soccer
and the sport in the country is on the brink of being out of
control.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese soccer governing body did not exactly say the two
matches had been rigged in their Wednesday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
"The two clubs played passively and slacked off in the crucial
moment of the league, which violated the National Soccer
Competition Discipline Regulations and is against the fundamental
sporting spirits of fairplay," Nan said at the routine soccer
briefing yesterday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The second division league will start its last round of
matches on October 17.

<HEADLINE> Role of Japan in Regional Recovery to be Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Economic and Industrial Cooperation Committee (AMEICC),
which comprises heads of ASEAN economic ministries and Japan's
Ministry of International Trade and Investment (MITI), will also
hear Japan's appraisal of world economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, Supachai Panitchpakdi, who is also president of
AMEICC, met with Hajime Furuta, director-general of MITI Economic
Cooperation Department to discuss detail of the agenda for the
meeting, the Bangkok Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
one of the major items for discussion will be more industrial
cooperation between Japan and ASEAN countries, Supachai was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, in particular, wants assistance from Japan to
strengthen its small-and medium-sized enterprises (SME'S)
</P>
<P>
The recent economic crisis clearly revealed that the country's
SME's were very weak, Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand would also ask for more Japanese investment in
Thailand's automobile industry as the country is a large
production base for many leading Japanese vehicle makers.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected that the forthcoming meeting will discuss
the form of assistance to be provided to new ASEAN members --
Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar -- in preparation for them joining the
ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) by 2008.
</P>
<P>
The original ASEAN members have set a target of 2003 to
implement the free trade area.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian National
Assembly Wednesday approved the government's proposal to allow the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) aircraft to fly over
its territory in the event of military action against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was passed by most parliament members from six
parties during a special meeting.
</P>
<P>
All members of the Federation of Young Democrats-Hungarian
Civic Party (Fidesz), the Independent Smallholders Party (FKGP),
the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) and most of the Hungarian
Democratic Forum (MDF) and the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP)
voted for the proposal.
</P>
<P>
But all MPs from the Hungarian Justice and Life Party (MIEP),
and several MPs from the MDF and the MSZP voted against the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that once NATO launches its threatened air
attacks on Yugoslavia over the Kosovo crisis, alliance's aircraft
will use Hungarian air space during a second round of air strikes,
which could occur about a week after the first round of strikes.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Launch Anti-AIDS Awareness Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's National AIDS Committee
plans to launch a month-long awareness campaign on AIDS prevention
beginning on November 1st in light of the increasing rate of
HIV/AIDS infection in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
According to an official report Thursday, 10,336 HIV/AIDS
carriers had been identified in 60 of Vietnam's 61 provinces and
cities by October 10.
</P>
<P>
Of the infected, 1,893 have developed full-blown AIDS and 1,008
have died, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh City and the northern border province of Quang Ninh
have the highest numbers of HIV/AIDS cases in the country.
</P>
<P>
Only the northern border province of Ha Giang remains free from
the fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
The disease is spreading quickly in northern Vietnam,
especially among youths and working-age people.
</P>
<P>
Tests conducted on new army recruits in 1998 found 1.7 percent
to be infected with HIV compared with 1.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The rate of HIV carriers among prostitutes picked up at random
for tests has also increased from 4 percent last year to 7.3
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Increasing drug abuse among young people is one of the reasons
behind the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will set up an HIV/AIDS behavioral surveillance system
early next year in addition to the current two HIV/AIDS-related
surveillance systems, according to Chung A, vice president of the
national committee.
</P>
<P>
Surveillance activities will be carried out in 20 provinces and
cities with high rates of HIV/AIDS infection with the aim to
define the mode of HIV transmission in Vietnam and to seek the
solutions.
</P>
<P>
The current two are the HIV/AIDS epidemiological surveillance
system and the monitoring and managing system of
sexually-transmitted patients.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Officials Foil Attempt to Smuggle Snakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian security officials
at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport here have foiled an
attempt to smuggle eight snakes to Moscow, the Jakarta Post
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The suspected smuggled, a Russian named Vladimir, was about to
board Aeroflot Flight 566 last Thursday evening when the airport
security noticed moving items in his bag through the X-ray
monitoring screen, head of the airport's animal quarantine center
Lukas A. Tonga said.
</P>
<P>
After a brief check, quarantine officials found the Russian's
specially designed bag was filled with snakes, including three
hazardous Papuan Taipans, which were unique to Irian Jaya
province.
</P>
<P>
"All of the snakes are very expensive. The dreadful taipans,
for example, cost 300 U.S. dollars here in Indonesia," said Wawan
Sutian, one of the quarantine's veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
He speculated that Vladimir was going to sell the snakes'
poison as it could be converted into valuable antivenin.
</P>
<P>
"The price of the antivenin ranges between 250 U.S. dollars and
1,000 U.S. dollars per ampoule, depending upon the level of the
poison," he said.
</P>
<P>
Similar to last month's finding, the airport's officials said
they failed to arrest the suspect as the Russian was already
boarding, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On September 29, airport officials also foiled a similar
attempt to take out of the country a collection of 67 reptiles,
including pythons, monitors and turtles, which were about to be
smuggled to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The alleged owner of the bag Leong Kok Tieng managed to fly
without being able to be touched by the airport authorities.

<HEADLINE> Italian Government Calls for New CONI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Italy's caretaker Sports Minister
Walter Veltroni on Wednesday called for a new Italian Olympic
Committee (CONI) after saying the government had found evidence
that CONI dope tests breached International Olympic Committee (I
OC) criteria.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to CONI vice-president Bruno Grandi, Veltroni
slammed the independent body for the way it ran sport in Italy
and ordered it to completely reform itself.
</P>
<P>
Veltroni wrote to Grandi after examining the findings of a
three-man government commission set up to investigate test
practices at CONI labs.
</P>
<P>
The investigation opened on September 14 following persistent
allegations in the Italian media that there were malpractice in
CONI's doping tests.
</P>
<P>
Since the commission was set up, CONI president Mario Pescante
has resigned, the head of the organisation's anti-doping panel
has stepped down, CONI's Rome laboratory has been shut and five
of its employees have been sacked.
</P>
<P>
Veltroni said the CONI of the future had to be "leaner and l
ess bureaucratic" and suggested a deadline of January 1, 1999, by
which reforms should be implemented.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak Economy Falling Deeper into Mire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The first quarter of 1998-99
fiscal year (July 1 to June 30 ) has ended on a rather dismal note
as the U.S.-led economic sanctions exert negative influence on
Pakistan's fragile economy.
</P>
<P>
All major economic indicators paint a vague picture and show
that Pakistan's economy, beset with years of structural problems,
is indeed in troubled water, altering the prospects of any
economic development in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The revenue collection during the first three months of the
current fiscal year has declined by 15 percent from an estimated
target of 67.70 billion rupees (46 rupees equals one U.S. dollar)
to about 58 billion rupees.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the government's bank borrowing for
budgetary purposes has burst the ceiling for the year, reaching an
astonishing 45 billion rupees in three months against the
estimated target of 43 billion rupees for the whole financial
year.
</P>
<P>
Panicked by the early trend seen in the revenue collection, the
government is reported to have decided to scale down the
projection of revenue collection for the current fiscal year from
354.6 billion rupees as envisaged in the budget for 1998-99 to 325
billion rupees.
</P>
<P>
The declining trend in revenue collection reflects the almost
total stagnation in the vital industrial sector and negative
production of investment related items like cement and steel. And
the consumption of oil make it more than obvious that in the
coming months this trend in revenue collection will become much
more marked.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Pakistan's current economic crisis, with a
mountain of accumulated outstanding debt, is aggravated by the
economic sanctions in the wake of its nuclear detonation at the
end of May and freezing of foreign currency accounts. It is
undoubtedly the most serious one since Pakistan's inception in
1947.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown of the economy was initially started due to mainly
to the stagnancy of the agriculture sector after repeated failures
of the cotton crop. However, the crisis has been deepened by
contraction of the industrial sector and decline in the foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
The export sector has made the matter doubly worrisome. The new
fiscal year has begun with a decline of as much as 20 percent in
exports in the three months, falling from 1.7 billion dollars to
1.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The imports, on the other hand, also continue to decline
keeping the trade deficit well in control. But that is no
consolation because the imports decline has affected the revenue
collection by the customs and it also indicates a declining trend
in investments which threatens to make the economy worse in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
The workers' remittances are also showing declining trend. In
the first quarter of current fiscal year, the amount of
remittances is paltry 350 million dollars, a fall of as much as 40
percent against the comparable period in the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign private investment during July, the first
month of current fiscal year, was estimated at only 22.7 million
dollars against 108 million dollars during the same month of last
fiscal year, registering a decrease of nearly 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Textile exports, which play a pivotal role in the country's
export sector, have also decreased by 168.44 million dollars in
the first quarter of 1998-99, depicting an unabated recession.
</P>
<P>
The economic barometer suggests that Pakistan's economy is
facing serious problems, and it is extremely hard for an early
revival in the present setting.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that limited capital, the non
availability of foreign exchange, the stagnant industrial sector
marked with weakening exports and lower investment will make the
economy of this south Asian nation all the more difficult in the
coming months.

<HEADLINE> hke101503--Indonesian President Issues Anti-discrimination Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie has issued an instruction barring government agencies and
officials from discriminating against Indonesians based on their
origins, the Jakarta Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a decision dated September 16, the President ordered
ministers, heads of state agencies, governors, mayors and regents
to dispense with use of the terms pribumi (indigenous) and
nonpribumi (nonindigenous).
</P>
<P>
The instruction was "to give equal treatment and services to
all Indonesian citizens... and to remove any discrimination in any
form, nature or level, to all Indonesian citizens, be it based on
tribal, religious, racial affiliations or origins", the decision
said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese-Indonesians have often complained that the government
systematically treats them as second-class citizens. Their
identity cards are given special codes, and careers in the
military and government bureaucracy are practically closed to
them.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the country's top newspaper editors in June,
Habibie said he would regard any citizen who was concerned about
and committed to improving the fate of the nation as indigenous,
regardless of their ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
In his instruction, the president also decided to review any
unfair laws or government regulations in business and service
sectors, "including the issuance of permits in business, finance
and banking, education, health, job opportunity and scheme of
salary or income for workers".
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Frans Hendra Winarto told the Jakarta Post that he
welcomed the decision, but urged concrete steps from all
government institutions to eradicate any form of discrimination
against Chinese-Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
"The government still needs to repeal one by one policies that
discriminate against ethnic Chinese," said Frans, a longtime
observer of Chinese-Indonesian issues and himself of Chinese
ancestry.

September, when industrial enterprises generated 8.08 billion yuan
in added value, 814 million yuan more than the previous month and
up 8.9 percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Of the 65.8 billion yuan worth of added value, 37.1 billion
yuan was accomplished by state-owned and state-controlled
industrial enterprises, up by 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the past nine months, added value generated by
collectively-owned industries rose by 11.8 percent, and that done
by large and medium-sized enterprises in the province grew 2.1
percent to 33.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the state's increased investment in improving
infrastructure and spurring domestic demand, the province saw a
faster growth in heavy industrial production and production of
some raw materials. Heavy industrial enterprises in the province
completed 41.1 billion yuan of added value from January to
September, up by 8.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the marketing of locally produced goods also
experienced significant improvement. Henan sold 198.1 billion yuan
worth of manufactured goods in the first nine months this year, up
4.7 percent, and achieved a marketing-production ratio of 95.62
percent.

<HEADLINE> NBA Studying Luxury Tax Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- NBA is studying carefully
the union's new luxury tax proposal Wednesday to see if it will
reduce the players' salary growth.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to examine every element of this tax to see
whether under some circumstance, at the right levels and in the
right amounts, a tax could work," commissioner David Stern said.
</P>
<P>
If the owners accept the idea and work out a counterproposal
Friday, it means the sides have found a way to negociate the core
issue in the lockout.
</P>
<P>
The lockout is now over 100 days, and the league canceled the
first two weeks of the season Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Both sides are awaiting a ruling from arbitrator John Feerick
on the union's grievance over whether more than 200 players with
guaranteed contracts should be paid during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
The players made their tax proposal Tuesday, indicating to
owners that they are willing to give ground to get the season
started. The tax would theoretically be a deterrent against
owners signing their own free agents to overly lucrative
long-term contracts.
</P>
<P>
But the owners said the tax proposal was far from a
breakthrough, yet they seemed surprised nonetheless that the
union was offering a way to control superstar salaries.
</P>
<P>
Under the union's offer, a 50 percent tax would be levied on
the amount of any annual salary over 18 million, with the tax
money to be redistributed to low-revenue teams.
</P>
<P>
Stern indicated that the owners might accept a luxury tax
proposal if it included a fall-back provision that included a
hard cap.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Grain Warehouse with Huge Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
decided to put 15 billion yuan (1.8 billion US dollars) into
building grain warehouses this year, an investment in a single
year 30 times as much as in previous years to deal with the
country's acute shortage of grain storage capacity.
</P>
<P>
It is part of 100 billion yuan that was raised in the latest
treasury bond issue aimed at boosting infrastructure investment
and will be used for warehouses to keep 25 billion kilograms of
grain in state reserves, according to the State Development
Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the facilities will be completed before the
harvest next summer, the commission said, adding that 45 of them
are under construction.
</P>
<P>
Every year, only about 500 million yuan is used for grain
warehouses for state reserves, far less than what is needed.
</P>
<P>
There are only 15 special warehouses for state grain reserves,
which can hold a mere 0.02 percent of the total reserves. The rest
is stored in rented facilities.
</P>
<P>
Local warehouses are small and many are located in remote
areas, which affects macro-economic controls of the central
government, said a commission official.
</P>
<P>
China's grain market reforms call for the strict separation of
central and local government grain reserves, so more warehouses
are badly needed, he added.

<HEADLINE> Big Names Fail to Shine at Euro Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- World soccer big names failed
to impress at the European Soccer Championships qualifying
matches on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
World champions France, who were expected to score a hatful
against their neighbouring part-timers Andorra, managed only a
2-0 win at the Stade de France, their first match back in the
stadium where they defeated Brazil to lift the World Cup in July.
</P>
<P>
They were forced to wait until the 53rd minute before Vincent
Candela opened the scoring in their group four match, and even
though Youri Djorkaeff added a second eight minutes later, the
moral victory was Andorra's if not the points, which moved France
up to second behind Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
European champions Germany, who started the defence of their
European title with a shock 1-0 group three defeat in Turkey on
Saturday, were given another scare when they went behind after
only eight minutes to Moldova -- before re-asserting the natural
order of things with a 3-1 win.
</P>
<P>
Just as on Saturday there was another big shock in Turkey --
but this time it was the hosts who went crashing, losing 3-1 to
Finland.
</P>
<P>
The Finns, who have never qualified for a European
championship or World Cup, currently top the standings with six
points, ahead of Turkey on goal difference -- but Germany, on
three points, have a match in hand.
</P>
<P>
England, another big name who have made an indifferent start
to the qualifiers. again failed to impress despite winning 3-0 in
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
They remained third in group five on four points behind
Poland, who did not play, and Sweden, who won a tough match in
Bulgaria 1-0.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, who beat England 2-1 in their first match five weeks
ago, won with a 62nd minute goal from Henrik Larsson for a
victory that gave them a maximum return of six points from their
opening games.
</P>
<P>
Spain, another traditional force struggling to find form, also
had to come from behind to beat Israel, winning 2-1 in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Spain remain third in group six behind Austria, who won 4-1 in
San Marino, and the Israelis, who have both played one match more.
</P>
<P>
But there was no respite for Russia, who slumped to their
third successive defeat in group four, losing 1-0 to Iceland in
Reykjavik and finishing a thoroughly miserable night with only 10
men after Alexei Smertin was sent off 16 minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Iceland's winner came two minutes from time from Runar
Kristinsson.
</P>
<P>
Russia had previously lost to Ukraine and France and already
look out of contention.
</P>
<P>
There was a thrilling group eight match in Zagreb where
Croatia beat Macedonia 3-2 thanks in part to two goals from
Zvonimir Boban after 45 and 70 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia had started the day in top place in the group, but
fell back to third with Croatia moving up to second after winning
two of their three opening games.
</P>
<P>
And there was another good game in Cardiff, where Wales, who
have been in the international doldrums for years, chalked up
their second win in four days with a 3-2 comeback victory over
Belarus.
</P>
<P>
That win lifted Wales level on points with group leaders
Italy, who have one match in hand.
</P>
<P>
In the same group Ole Tobiasen scored in the last minute as
Denmark, the 1992 European champions, forced a 1-1 draw with
Switzerland in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's 22 matches completed a "double-header" round of
qualifiers following the 20 played on Saturday but there is still
an unfamiliar look to most of the groups with Latvia, Ukraine,
and Ireland setting the pace in their tables.
</P>
<P>
Latvia remain on top of group two despite going down 1-0 to
Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine maintained their 100 percent record and first place in
group four with a 2-0 win over Armenia, while Ireland stayed top
of group eight and were the biggest winners of the night by
crushing Malta 5-0.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic stay top of the group after crushing
Estonia 4-1.
</P>
<P>
Scotland, who are second and won for the second time in four
days after beating Estonia on Saturday, were jeered by the
Aberdeen crowd who felt let down by their team's performance in
their 2-1 win over the Faroes Islands.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile there was a memorable night for Liechtenstein.
</P>
<P>
After losing 19 of their 20 previous competitive matches,they
won a competitive game for the first time ever -- beating
Azerbaijan 2-1 in Vaduz.
</P>
<P>
Liechtenstein, who lost nine and drew one of their 10 Euro'96
qualifiers and lost all 10 of their France '98 World Cup
qualifers, finally broke their duck with a 47th minute penalty
from Mario Frick and a second two minutes later from Martin
Telser.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan replied with a Kurban Kurbanov goal after 59
minutes, but that was not enough to spoil the celebrations of the
1,900 home crowd.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Top Clubs Hope to Have Closer Co-operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Twelve of Europe's top clubs
asked European soccer governing body UEFA for closer co-operation
in the organisation of the European Champions' League and
insisted on having more input in financial matters.
</P>
<P>
The 12, including all the biggest names in the European game,
met in Milan on Wednesday to discuss the latest developments in
the Super League saga and issued a joint statement through AC
Milan, who hosted the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"These clubs (Ajax Amsterdam, Barcelona, Bayern Munich,
Borussia Dortmund, Inter Milan, Juventus, Liverpool, Manchester
United, AC Milan, Olympique Marseille, Porto, Real Madrid) have
found that they share the same opinions, interests and intentions
with respect to their relations with UEFA," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"While acknowledging UEFA's authority in sporting matters, the
clubs express their determination to be henceforth involved in
all decisions pertaining to activities concerning the format of
the European Champions' League, the exploitation of television
rights to which the clubs are entitled, and the advertising
activities associated with the football events of which the clubs
are the undisputed protagonists.
</P>
<P>
"These historic clubs have asked UEFA for a hopefully
collaborative meeting during which they intend to present their
specific proposals, based on the aforementioned principles.
</P>
<P>
"The 12 clubs are confident that their initiative will be
favourably received by UEFA and are certain that the proposals
will favour all the clubs involved in European competitions today
and in the future."
</P>
<P>
The clubs faxed their message to UEFA president Lennart
Johansson and European soccer's governing body said in statement
that they had received it in a positive way.
</P>
<P>
UEFA general secretary Gerhard Aigner said UEFA had already
shown their willingness to co-operate, starting with the
formation of the task force.
</P>
<P>
"UEFA and the clubs have many interests in common," said
Aigner. "If the clubs want to be more deeply involved in the
organisation of the competitions, then we also have to speak
about responsibility.
</P>
<P>
"So far, only UEFA have borne the financial risk of a hundred
million Swiss francs.
</P>
<P>
"The dialogue will continue within the next weeks."
</P>
<P>
Last week UEFA announced changes to the format of the
Champions' League expanding the competition from 24 to 32 clubs
next season when the UEFA and Cup Winners' Cup will also be
merged. They intend giving details of their financial
arrangements after their next Executive Committee meeting in
Israel in December.
</P>
<P>
The changes came in response to attempts by Milan-based Media
Partners to set up a 1.2 billion U.S. dollars Super League.
</P>
<P>
Media Partners were not involved in Wednesday's meeting but
will continue to talk to the clubs.

<HEADLINE> Gamma Bursts May Come from Supernovas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Some of the powerful gamma ray
bursts may come from the explosion of dying stars called
supernovas, astronomers suggested Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, United States, said they have observed an unusual
supernova, which occurred at about the same time, and in
approximately the same direction, as a burst of gamma rays.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the scientific journal Nature, the researchers said
the supernova was accompanied by a relativistic shock wave, which
they suggested produced the burst of gamma rays.
</P>
<P>
The supernova may have generated the gamma ray burst by
ejecting a stream of material at close to the speed of light, the
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
The sources of gamma ray bursts, which produces high-energy
powerful light, have puzzled astronomers for more than twenty
years. Until now scientists had thought that supernovas and gamma
ray bursts were unrelated.
</P>
<P>
The supernova connected with the gamma ray burst occurred
relatively close to the earth, a phenomenon so unusual to the
researchers that they argued this unusual supernova established a
distinctly different second class of gamma-ray burst.
</P>
<P>
The American researchers' conclusion was echoed in a separate
report in Nature. Scientists form the University of Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, suggested that the very unusual supernova may have
been the birth of a black hole.

<HEADLINE> Rudolph Charged with 1996 Olympics Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal authorities on
Wednesday charged Eric Robert Rudolph, one of the FBI's 10
most-wanted fugitives, with bombings including one blasted in
the Centennial Park in Atlanta during the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno said the criminal complaint
charging Rudolph with the Olympic blast and the 1997 bombings of a
gay bar and an abortion clinic was being filed with a federal
court.
</P>
<P>
Reno said that Rudolph is on the run. But she said, "We are
going to keep searching until we find him and we're not going to
rest until we bring him to justice."
</P>
<P>
Louis Freeh, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI), said Rudolph "now is charged with six bombings," including
three in Atlanta and the January 29 bombing of a Birmingham,
Alabama, abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
Rudolph was placed on the FBI's Most Wanted List last May, and
a one million U.S. dollars reward was offered based on earlier
charges that he bombed a Birmingham abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
Rudolph was publicly linked to the Atlanta attacks last month
when it was learned a Tennessee gun dealer identified Rudolph as
the man who bought a special order of 50 pounds of smokeless
powder four years ago. Law enforcement official determined that
powder has been connected to the 1996 bombing at Centennial
Olympic Park.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic bombing killed one person and wounded more than 100
others. An off-duty policeman working as a guard was killed and a
nurse was injured in the Birmingham bombing.

<HEADLINE> Least Developed Countries Vulnerable to Price Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The inclement weather
and the commodity prices falls are likely to put a brake on the
recent economic recovery in the 48 least developed countries
(LDCs), the United Nations warned on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The LDCs, mostly in Africa, have a combined population of 600
million and an average per capita GDP of about 230 U.S. dollars.
They recorded another solid performance in 1997, the latest year
that the U.N. has been able to comply data.
</P>
<P>
LDCs gross domestic product averaged 4.8 percent against 3.2
percent for the world economy and 5.4 percent for developing
countries as a whole, down from the 5.5 percent they chalked in
1996, the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said
in its latest report on LDCs.
</P>
<P>
Looking ahead, UNCTAD said devastating floods in Bangladesh and
above-average rainfall in Bhutan and Nepal this year and hurricane
damage in Haiti foreshadow further difficulties in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"What makes the LDCs especially vulnerable to the vagaries of
the weather and world commodity prices is their lack of export
diversification", UNCTAD said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, most LDCs' exports have been limited to
two or three products, almost all of which were sold in raw or
semi-processed form.
</P>
<P>
Of the 28 LDCs for which there are comparable export data, only
five reduced their commodity dependence during the decade.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, their integration into world trade has declined,
compared with that of other developing countries, UNCTAD noted.
</P>
<P>
Output in 1996 represented less than one percent of world GDP
and their export share was only around 0.4 percent. Among the 48
LDCs, only 29 are World Trade Organization members.
</P>
<P>
The LDCs received only 1.5 percent of foreign direct investment
flows into developing countries and their share of worldwide flows
was only 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Official development assistance (ODA) from OECD (Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development) countries dropped to
0.05 percent of their GDP in 1996, down from 0.06 percent
previously.
</P>
<P>
The LDCs faced a grim debt picture with a combined external
debt of 134 billion dollars in 1996, equivalent to 90 percent of
their total GDP.
</P>
<P>
Many LDCs have been unable to meet debt-serving obligations and
have had to request rescheduling of official debt, UNCTAD said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Records Surplus, Cautious on Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Finance Minister Paul
Martin said Wednesday that the Canadian government has got a
3.5-billion-dollar (2.3 billion U.S. dollars) budget surplus, but
it is still not the time for big tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
"This is an historic milestone. And it is an achievement that
belongs not to the government but to Canadians themselves," Martin
told the House of Commons Finance Committee in his annual economic
and fiscal update.
</P>
<P>
The surplus has been applied directly to the national debt,
which were 579.7 billion dollars at the end of the 1997-98 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Yet, despite the improvement in the country's finances, Martin
said it is still too early to cut taxes. "We must be realistic
about the resources at our disposal," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Safeguarding our financial health at home is the sine qua non
of riding out the global storm we are now in," he noted.

<HEADLINE> FAO Promotes Women's Role on World Food Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Marking this year's World Food
Day on October 16, a world food body will use global telecast to
encourage the participation of women in food production, and raise
money to help them become more productive.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference at the Near East head office of the Food
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Cairo
Wednesday, Atif Y. Bukhari, the FAO representative for the Near
East, announced the inauguration of the TeleFood '98 campaign in
the Near East.
</P>
<P>
TeleFood global telecast, an annual project initiated by FAO in
1997 in support of its campaign to end hunger around the world,
will highlight women's decisive role in household and national
food security during this year's World Food Day celebrations
events from Thursday to Sunday, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Under the theme "Women Feed the World" of TeleFood 98,
television and radio programs will transmit to the world pictures
and information highlighting women's contribution to the battle
against poverty and hunger, and urging solidarity to reach the
goal of "Food for All."
</P>
<P>
On a global scale, women produce more than half of all the food
that is grown. In sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, they
produce up to 80 percent of basic foodstuffs. In Asia, they
provide from 50 to 90 percent of the labor for rice cultivation.
</P>
<P>
Despite their contributions to food security, women tend to be
invisible actors in development and their role is poorly
understood and often underestimated, Bukhari told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The fight against hunger is not an issue of charity: it is an
issue of justice... We have to act to help poor farmers,
especially women, gain access to the tools and knowledge to feed
their families and community. TeleFood offers us an opportunity to
express our solidarity and commitment to eradicate hunger," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the Arab countries' television stations will
broadcast programs since October 15, to raise the public awareness
to the tragedies of 800 million people who suffer from chronic
hunger and the fact that more than 10 children under the age of
five die of hunger or malnutrition every minute. Donations will be
collected to finance more projects for ending poverty.
</P>
<P>
"Give women the money, the education and whatever help they
need to produce, and see what they can. I think that's what the
TeleFood 98 is all about," Assel el-Dessouky, the assistant to
information officer at the Near East office, told Xinhua after the
press conference.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 500 million people in more than 60 countries
participated in the first global TeleFood campaign, which featured
performances and statements of solidarity from international
singers, actors, and athletes.
</P>
<P>
Viewers learned face to face about the affliction of hunger and
contributed more than 2 million U.S. dollars to help poor farmers
produce food where it is most needed.
</P>
<P>
Bukhari said the Near East countries have benefited
considerably from these donations, getting a total of 125,540
dollars, which enabled FAO to establish 20 projects in seven
countries, including the famine-stricken Sudan where the
percentage of employed women working in agriculture is 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Donations from last year's first TeleFood are not huge, but
they will definitely grow in the future. And after all, TeleFood
is more about awareness than money," he added.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Govt Endorses Milosevic-Holbrooke Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government on
Wednesday fully endorsed the accord reached by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, the Yugoslav
Information Secretariat said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The accord, reached on Tuesday after nine days intensive talks,
"provides for resolving all issues in Serbia's southern province
of Kosovo in a peaceful manner, respecting the territorial
integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Serbia and the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and averts the threats of military
intervention against the country," Yugoslav news agency Tanjug
quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Yugoslavia will allow a 2,000-strong
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) force
into Kosovo to ensure it complies with U.N. demands for the
withdrawal of Serbian troops and the return of refugees driven out
of home during the seven-month conflict in the province.
</P>
<P>
"The Yugoslav government fully endorses the decisions and
stances defined by Serbian government and Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic in order to implement the accord," said the statement
which was issued after the government held a session chaired by
Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic.
</P>
<P>
The government of Serbia, which makes up the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia with Montenegro, endorsed the Milosevic-Holbrooke
deal on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug said the Yugoslav government has finalized the text of
its agreement with OSCE on its Verification Mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government had also empowered Foreign Minister
Zivadin Jovanovic to sign this agreement with OSCE Chairman,
Bronislaw Geremek, who is expected to fly into Belgrade on Friday
to sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
As part of the process of verification and implementation of
the Security Council Resolution 1199, "Yugoslavia will allow a
non-combat airplane to observe the situation in Kosovo with the
aim of peaceful verification," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy Stresses Comprehensive Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) envoy said
Wednesday that there will be no just peace in the Middle East
unless the peace drive on Syrian- and Lebanese-Israeli tracks are
also revived.
</P>
<P>
Miguel Angel Moratinos, the EU special envoy to the Middle
East, made the remarks after talks with Syria Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa on the latest developments in the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
His words came just one-day ahead of the three-way summit near
Washington among U.S. President Bill Clinton, Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said it is high time to stress that all the tracks in
the peace process should be stimulated.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Netanyahu will arrive in Washington Thursday to try
to wrap up a deal on further Israeli troops redeployment in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos said that he has briefed Sharaa on the outcome of his
recent talks with Palestinians, Israeli and U.S. officials and the
EU's role in the Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks have been stalled since early 1996 and
Syria has refused to resume talks with Israel unless it agrees to
return the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos also said that he has discussed with Sharaa the
on-going tensions between Syria and Turkey and the EU's efforts to
defuse the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Syria has been criticizing the U.S. for conniving at Israel's
intransigence.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that since the signing of the Oslo Accords in
1993, Israel has been building settlements in occupied Arab land
while demolishing Palestinian homes.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Opposition Leader Returns From Exile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian opposition leader and
Nobel literature laureate Wole Soyinka Wednesday returned home
from four years of self exile.
</P>
<P>
Soyinka, who arrived at the Lagos International Airport
Wednesday evening aboard a Lufthansa flight, was met at the
airport by his friends and well-wishers, said local radio
reports.
</P>
<P>
Soyinka's return marks a major step taken by the country's
exiled opposition groups in response to Nigerian Head of State
General Abdulsalam Abubakar's repeated call on them to return and
join the on-going democratization program.
</P>
<P>
Several other opposition members had already returned to the
country from exile earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to pay a condolence visit to the family of
Moshood Abiola, the alleged winner of the annulled June 12, 1993
presidential election who died last July on the eve of his
release from four years of detention.
</P>
<P>
Soyinka is also expected to deliver a speech in Lagos Friday
on the transition to civil rule program and the future of the
most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader escaped Nigeria in 1994 after he was
banned from traveling by the then government of late General Sani
Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Since his succession of Abacha in June, Nigeria's new leader
Abubakar has taken bold steps in promoting national
reconciliation and democratization.
</P>
<P>
He has released all political detainees and opened dialog with
opposition groups, and announced a new transition program that is
scheduled to usher in an elected civilian government by May 29,
1999.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar called on the country's self-exiled opposition
members to return and join what he called the "all-inclusive"
democratization process. To show his sincerity, the Nigerian
head of state ordered the withdrawal of all charges against them.
</P>
<P>
Soyinka indicated his willingness to return in September when
he met with Abubakar in New York where the latter was attending
the 53rd United Nations General Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Parliament Okays Access by NATO Aircraft over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 14 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Parliament on
Wednesday passed the decision of the Supreme National Defense
Council (CSAT) to grant access over its airspace to NATO "in
emergency and unforeseen situations".
</P>
<P>
CSAT, on October 11, as an answer to the request by the NATO,
decided to allow the NATO aircrafts access the Romanian airspace
"in emergency and unforeseen situations", and also gave green
light to Romania' participation in peace-keeping and humanitarian
operations with a Humanitarian Support Multifunctional Mobile
Detachment, formed by a medical section, another section for
refugees housing and a third one for reconstructing crashed
dwellings.
</P>
<P>
Romanian political parties were divided in their reaction to
the decision. Many appreciated the non-participation decision in
NATO military operation in Yugoslavia and considered it to be in
line with international practice to offer Romania's airspace to
NATO in emergency.
</P>
<P>
But others emphasized that Romania should not provide any help
to NATO by noting that to open airspace is equal to providing
logistic assistance to it.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Victor Babiuc, one of the key members of CSAT,
Wednesday stressed in the Parliament sitting that the decision of
CSAT has "humanitarian" and not "military" goals. "Romania has
never intended to involve at a military level, just at a
humanitarian one," he said, explaining that the CSAT decision
singles out four ideas: peaceful playing down of the conflict,
allowing NATO aircrafts to fly over Romania's territory in
emergency and unforeseen situations, Romania' s staying back from a
military involvement in the conflict and a post-conflict
participation with a multifunctional mobile division for
humanitarian support.
</P>
<P>
Romania makes no act of aggression against Yugoslavia by this
decision, as long as the support towards NATO is of humanitarian
nature, the Defense Minister added, in response to some previous
statements of the oppositions.
</P>
<P>
President Emil Contantinescu hailed the Parliament soon after
the vote, appreciating this legislative institution's capacity to
overcome its political disputes and biases.

<HEADLINE> Canada Condemns Shooting Down of Congo Airlines Jet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada Wednesday condemned the
recent shooting down of a Congo Airlines jet near the town of
kindu, in the Democratic Republic of Congo and urged all parties
to renew immediately negotiations to achieve a cease-fire in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The use of missiles represents an intensification of the
fighting, with its possibility of further deterioration, making it
even more urgent for all parties to resume negotiations under the
leadership of African leaders for a cessation of hostilities,"
said Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy in a release.
</P>
<P>
The Minister also underlined his previous calls for action by
the international community to support African efforts in the
search for an immediate cease-fire, the withdrawal of foreign
troops and a negotiated settlement to the current dispute that
will ensure the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
Democratic Republic of Congo and its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"Civilian populations are once again the principal victims in
this conflict, which has sparked civilian acts of ethnic violence
and discrimination," added Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
The downing of the Congo Airlines commercial jet is the latest
major development in the conflict, in which forces loyal to the
Congolese government have been opposed by rebel fighters since
August 2.
