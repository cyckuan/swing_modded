SARAJEVO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of the Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) announced on Thursday that it has
decided to extend the deadline of in-country voter registration
for Bosnia's local elections.
</P>
<P>
The extension of the deadline from June 16 to June 28 was aimed
at allowing more voters inside Bosnia to register, according to
David Foley, a spokesman for OSCE. The deadline for out-of-country
voter registration remains on June 14.
</P>
<P>
Foley said that out of estimated 3.5 million eligible voters,
only 1.8 million have registered, including both people inside
Bosnia and refugees abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian local elections, arranged by OSCE, will be held in
September and the race is participated by more than 100 parties.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, OSCE Provision Election Commission, which is
in charge of the local elections, announced that it has demanded
the removal of presidents of the Brcko election commission and of
voter registration centers there for pervasive violation of
registration rules.
</P>
<P>
OSCE said that cases of violation such as providing false
documents and bringing refugees from outside have been found in
Brcko that the voters were forced to close down on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Foley said that a new voter registration for Brcko will start
on June 18 and last until July 12.

Boat Racing Championships from June 12-15 and the Hong Kong Dragon
 Boat Festival International Races from June 15-16.
</P>
<P>
At the venue of Shing Mun River in Sha Tin, some 1,300 athletes
 from 18 countries and regions are competing in the four-day world
 championships.
</P>
<P>
Under the auspices of the International Dragon Boat Federation
(IDBF), the sport's world governing body, the world championships

<HEADLINE> US Retail Sales Decline for Third Straight Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in the U.S.
declined by 0.1 percent in May, the third straight drop, the U.S.
Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that U.S. retail sales slipped another 0.1
percent last month following declines of 0.9 percent in April and
0.3 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The three straight declines in the retail sales were the first
since consecutive drops in September through November of 1981, at
the end of the severe 1980-81 recession.
</P>
<P>
The drop of retail sales were led by a 0.2 percent decline in
auto sales, the third straight decrease. Auto demand had slumped a
sharp 2 percent in April and was down 1.2 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The nation's largest department stores also reported weak sales
for May compared with the same month a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The setbacks in retail spending, which account for one-third of
total U.S. economic activity, are the clearest signal so far that
the U.S. economy has slowed from its 5.8 percent growth rate in
the first three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of moderating growth that will keep inflation
under control has been a key factor behind the recent surge in the
stock market. Investors are growing more confident that the U.S.
Federal Reserve (Fed) will not increase interest rates when its
policy-makers meet July 1-2.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Improves World Rating in UNDP Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has been ranked
90th, compared to 100th last year, out of 175 countries worldwide
in achievements of life expectancy, educational attainment and
adjusted real income, according to the United Nations Human
Development Report for 1997 released in Cape Town today.
</P>
<P>
South Africa improved its score this year maily to revision of
the data for life expectancy and real gross domestic product
(GDP) per capita, said the report, which also includes the human
development index (HDI).
</P>
<P>
However, the report pointed out that the progress in South
Africa's fight against human poverty remains uneven, and stark
disparities still exist between different race groups.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, the per capita income of the richest 20
percent was 19 times that of the poorest 20 percent, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The real per capita GDP of the richest 20 percent stood at
9897 US Dollars while that of the poorest 20 percent was 516 US
Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Africa's HDI rank of 90 was still below its
ranking of 80th with regard to real per capita GDP in terms of
purchasing power parity.
</P>
<P>
Statistics in the report further showed that 17 percent of
South Africans were not expected to survive until the age of 40,
among which only three percent of the Whites and 18 percent of
the Blacks.

president of India's Congress Party, has been re-elected according
to the results of the elections held on June 9, Press Trust of
India reported today.
</P>

<P>
Kesri became provisional party president in September last year
when his predecessor P.V. Narasimha Rao was forced to step down
due to his alleged involvement in a scandal.

<HEADLINE> Chinese CPPCC Leader's Europe Tour A Success: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
Li Ruihuan's visit to Portugal, Greece and Germany has been a
great success and has greatly promoted China's ties with the three
countries, a Chinese official accompanying Li during his visit
said on their way home today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xun, the CPPCC's secretary-general, said Li's Europe
tour, which lasted from May 26 to June 11, was made at the
invitation of the Portuguese, Greek parliaments and the German
government. The three countries attached much importance to Li's
visit and granted him a warm welcome.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said Li told his hosts he had attached much importance to
China's exchanges and cooperation with the three nations in
political, economic and cultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
Li said China is ready to make concerted efforts with the three
countries to continue to develop their friendly, long-term
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li also expressed heartfelt thanks, on behalf of the Chinese
government and its people, to the Greek government for helping
Chinese nationals in Albania withdraw from the country in
March.
</P>
<P>
The three nations think highly of China's reform policies and
its outstanding economic achievements and will follow China's
future development with great interest, Zhu added.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that China will stick to the late Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics. This is because the theory, representing the
people's interests and desires and having permeated into China's
political, economic and cultural sectors, has proved correct.
</P>
<P>
Li said the third-generation leadership of the Central
Committee of Chinese Communist Party, with Jiang Zemin at the
core, is a powerful unity loyal to Deng's theory and therefore is
totally capable of pushing even further China's reforms and
modernization.
</P>
<P>
There are three things essential to present-day China, Li
said. First, to stick to Deng's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics. Second, to maintain social stability and
order. Third, to resolve knotty economic and social problems
without delay. The Chinese people are confident that they will
step into the new century together with a more vigorous China.

<HEADLINE> German Car Industry Reports Surge in Domestic Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany car industry today reported a
19 percent surge in domestic orders in May, but only a two percent
slight increase in foreign demand.
</P>
<P>
According to the Frankfurt-based German Automobile Industry
Association VDI, Germany's production of all types of vehicles was
400,300 in May, down five percent from May last year. Adjusting
for the fewer working days in May this year, production was about
at the same level compared with the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
For the first five months of 1997, Germany has produced 2.13
million vehicles, unchanged from the level of the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Germany's car exports in the first five months were 1.28
million, up five percent over the same period of 1996, while
domestic sales dropped five percent to 1.62 million, the VDI said.

WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- An Asian-American lawyer in Los
Angeles will be named to the government's top civil rights post,
media reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton will appoint Bill Lann Lee, 48, as
assistant attorney general for civil rights, making him the first
person other than a white or black to hold the job.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed by the Senate, Lee, the son of Chinese immigrants,
would fill a position that has been vacant since the resignation
of Deval Patrick seven months ago. The division is charged with
litigating discrimination cases in housing, employment, education
and public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
Lee's father was penniless when he arrived as an immigrant in
New York City, but managed to establish Lee's Hand Laundry on the
outskirts of Harlem, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
With the help of a scholarship, Lee graduated Phi Betta Kappa
from Yale and later attended Columbia University Law School. He
has worked for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc.

<HEADLINE> New Budget Placed in Bangladeshi Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah
A.M.S. Kibria today placed in parliament 277.85 billion taka
(about 6.46 billion U.S. dollars) proposed national budget for the
1997-98 fiscal year from this July to next June.
</P>
<P>
The new budget, which includes a development outlay worth 128
billion taka (about 2.98 billion dollars) and food-for-works and
non-development project allocation of 4.4 billion taka (about 102
million dollars), set the economy growth rate as 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Although this was the second budget of the year-long government
of Sheikh Hasina, the new budget was considered as the first one
of its own because the last budget was made on the estimates of
the caretaker administration.
</P>
<P>
The budget estimated a revenue receipt of 196.24 billion taka
(about 4.56 billion dollars) and revenue expenditure of some
145.44 billion taka (about 3.38 billion dollars), leaving a
revenue surplus of 50.8 billion taka (about 1.18 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The revenue surplus will go to finance the Annual Development
Program (ADP), the government's development budget, which is 11
billion taka (about 256 million dollars) more than the revised ADP
of 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
The ADP, with 54 percent of the fund coming from the domestic
resources, is to raise growth of gross domestic product (GDP) to
at least 6 percent from the current 5.7 percent, said the finance
minister.
</P>
<P>
He said the tax proposals for the year 1997-98 had been
formulated keeping in mind introduction of a broad-base tax
system, in which the existing tax exemptions would be gradually
eliminated and every well-to-do person in the country would be
brought under the tax-net.
</P>
<P>
The budget proposals also introduced moderate tax rate and
simple collection procedures, while a tariff policy in line with
the international and regional trends has been proposed, said the
finance minister, adding that the progressive tax policy can
ensure social justice and equity.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts here said that the key aspect of the next
fiscal budget would be the implementation of the new pay scale for
government officials.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that an additional amount of 16 billion
taka (about 372 million dollars) would be required to implement
the new scales. To meet the gap, the government will have to
borrow from the banking sector, which was described by the central
bank governor as being "on the verge of collapse".

<HEADLINE> Sassou N'Guesso Threatens to Stop French Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Former president of the Congo
Republic General Sassou N'Guesso today threatened to stop French
planes from landing at the Brazzaville airport, if French troops
do not prevent his rival, President Pascal Lissouba, from using
the airport to receive reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
Sassou N'Guesso made the threat at an impromptu meeting with a
superior French officer stationed in Brazzaville, according to
Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
"We cannot accept that Lissouba use (airport) to transport
troops and ammunitions... We are at the end of the runway. If
necessary, we will ban all landing (of planes)," said Sassou
N'Guesso.
</P>
<P>
France has ruled out the possibility of intervening in the
fighting between the forces of Sassou N'Guesso and Lissouba, and
said that the 1,250 French troops deployed in Congo would leave as
soon as they have completed evacuating foreigners stranded in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
French troops have been using the Brazzaville airport to
evacuate thousands of foreigners from Brazzaville over the past
several days.
</P>
<P>
One French soldier was wounded today on the runway of the
airport, bringing the casualties inflicted upon the French troops
to one dead and seven wounded, two of them seriously, reported
AFP.
</P>
<P>
The leg of the French soldier was hit by a bullet in an
exchange of fires between Congolese government troops and the
"Cobra" militiamen of Sassou-N'Guesso.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, mortar shellings and shootings of automatic weapons
resumed this afternoon in Brazzaville between the government
forces and the Cobra militiamen along the "Peace Avenue"
approximately diving the northern and southern parts of the city
controlled separately by the two sides, according to reports
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
French troops were using armored vehicles to look for
foreigners stranded in dangerous areas and escort them to the
airport.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank aims to cut in half
the figure of the poor people in the world by 2015, World Bank
President James Wolfensohn told reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
Three billion people live with less than two U.S. dollars a day
and 1.3 billion on less than one U.S. dollars a day, Wolfensohn
said, pledging that the World Bank aims at "halving the figure of
poor people by 2015". Wolfensohn said that "Our world is a world
of great differences between countries: the rich and the poor, a
world of great inequities within countries, between the rich and
the poor, and those inequities are increasing".
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn is not satisfied with the investment flows of the
private sector. Of 240 billion U.S. dollars from the private
sector, he said, 75 percent goes to 12 countries or regions. 140
countries get less than five percent and Sub-Saharan Africa gets
around one percent.

<HEADLINE> Chinese CPPCC Leader's Europe Tour A Success: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhu Xun said that during his visit, Li explained China's
principled stance on civilization and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Li said countries with different cultural backgrounds should
respect and learn from each other and keep their own cultural
characters. Only when these principles are observed can human
society achieve peace and stability, diversity and progress.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with German leaders and reporters, Li elaborated
on China's basic views on human rights: the universally accepted
principles on human rights should be respected; they should be
combined with different situations in different countries; the
realization of the principles was a gradual process.
</P>
<P>
He said all countries should improve the development in the
cause of human rights through exchanges and dialogues on an equal
footing.
</P>
<P>
Some people were over-confident about their countries' human
rights conditions and made unwarranted charges against other
countries, especially the developing nations. This was by no means
helpful to the realization of the universally accepted principles.
</P>
<P>
Li's remarks drew much attention from the three countries'
leaderships and the media there.
</P>
<P>
Li praised those leaders' foresight and sagacity reflected in
developing bilateral relations with China and in other
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li said that a state leader, especially of an influential
country in the world, shoulders important historic responsibility
and should, therefore, be responsible for his words, actions and
decisions, and contribute more to the human society.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said there are some people in the world who spread the
rumor of "China Threat" with evil intentions. Li refuted the
rumor by calling it sheer fabrication.
</P>
<P>
Li said China had suffered a lot from foreign imperialist
aggressions and humiliations and paid a heavy price in blood in
resistance.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Chinese people hate and oppose hegemonism and
will never harm other countries by practicing it.
</P>
<P>
China is still a developing country with a rather backward
economy and culture. China will not bully and threaten others even
if it becomes strong and prosperous someday, he continued.
</P>
<P>
Li said the "China threat" is nothing but a pretext fabricated
by a handful of people who hate to see China continue to progress
on the road it chose for itself, for fear that a powerful China
would hinder their own practice of hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
When explaining China's foreign policy, Li stressed on more
than one occasion that "China's own conditions have determined
that we must create a friendly and peaceful international
environment in order to concentrate on developing the economy,
improving people's living standards, cooperating with other
countries and learning from others' experiences."
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to have brushes or contradictions with any
other nation. The progress of China, with a population of 1.2
billion, is in itself a great contribution to the international
community."
</P>
<P>
Li also told the leaders of the three countries about the
transition of Hong Kong and Deng's great concept of "one country,
two systems" for resolving the Taiwan, Kong Kong and Macao issues.
</P>
<P>
Portuguese leaders expressed confidence in continuing close
cooperation with China to achieve Macao's smooth return to China.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the three countries said they are confident Hong
Kong will remain stable and prosperous after its return.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed them about the makeup and basic functions of
the CPPCC as well as the construction of China's socialist
democracy.

Under the agreement, Westmont Offshore will install and
commission a 100 megawatt (MW) capacity barge-mounted plant at
Khulna and supply electricity to PDB within 10 months of signing
the agreement on a Built-Own-Operate basis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, three separate agreements for private sector power
generation were initialed in May and June for installation and
commissioning of three barge-mounted power plants of 100 MW
capacity each at Haripur, Sikalbaha and Khulna city respectively.

<P>
To solve the long-standing power crisis throughout the country,
the Bangladeshi government last October changed its policy and
allowed power generation by the private sector.

<HEADLINE> Japan Critised at CITES Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan appeared today to be on a
collision course with animal rights groups which are accusing the
economic giant of bribing weaker third world countries to buy
support for its marine policies.
</P>
<P>
The International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) said in a
report at the ongoing 10th conference of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Harare that
Japan was now applying its strategy on other wildlife issues such
as the ivory trade to support its agenda.
</P>
<P>
Lesley Sutty, author of the report co-sponsored by the Eastern
Caribbean Coalition for Environmental Awareness (ECCEA), told a
press briefing that Japan had systematically targeted countries
in the south Pacific, Latin America and Africa, offering
multi-million dollar grants and soft loans.
</P>
<P>
She said having seen its technique succeed in staving off
anti-whaling measures in the 1980s and early 1990s, Japan had now
extended it to elephants, a species considered in danger of
extinction by CITES.
</P>
<P>
She said Japan, with a potentially huge and lucrative market
for ivory, was supporting the downlisting of the elephant from
the CITES appendix i to appendix ii.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace, a leading environmental group today said Japan,
which is willing to buy Africa's ivory, does not have adequate
measures to control illegal trade.
</P>
<P>
The organisation held that in the event of a partial
relaxation of the international trade ban on ivory and other
elephant products, poaching is likely to restart.

HARARE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Harare city council today said
the health status of the capital, which has a population of more
than 1.4 million, continues to deteriorate as infant mortality
rose by 11 percent during the past year.
</P>
<P>
According to its annual report for 1996, the falling health
standards in the capital were attributed to increasing poverty,
overcrowding and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
City health director Lovemore Mbengeranwa said in the report
the rapid urbanisation was causing an increase in poverty-related
deaths, diseases associoted with industrialisation and social
instability.
</P>
<P>
"The city's health status continues to deteriorate as
evidenced by the rising infant mortality and the mortality of
those under the age of five years," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the problem of HIV/AIDS epidemic is also an
important factor.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak New Budget to Be Unveiled amid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The government led by Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif, which came to power in mid February, is to
present its first budget Friday amid mixed expectations and in the
backdrop of chronic economic problems.
</P>
<P>
With the national budget for the 1997-98 fiscal year to be
unfolded by Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz, the government is
confronted with an uphill task of reviving an almost collapsed
economy.
</P>
<P>
Despite unprecedented perils looming over Pakistan's economic
frontiers, the government seems quite determined to execute
massive surgery of the economy which is already on through drastic
economic measures.
</P>
<P>
Extensive economic agenda pursued by the government for the
resurgence of the crisis-strapped economy still needs a lot to be
done for the consumers, who are facing acute problems of price
hikes and eroding purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
The current fiscal year will be remembered as the worst in
Pakistan's economic history, which is experiencing a rapid
deterioration of macroeconomic management.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's economy used to grow at a healthy rate of around
seven percent on average, yet it saw a major breakdown in its pace
in the 1996-97 fiscal year with estimates indicating its
deceleration to 3.1 percent by the end of June 30.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector, which accounts for a quarter of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP), is assessed to record a near negative
growth and the large-scale manufacturing sector, 1.4 percent in
the out-going fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal deficit, targeted to be four percent of the GDP, is
in no way near the target.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's total national debt has reached a staggering 60
billion US dollars and is expected to eat away almost two-thirds
of the federal tax receipts in the next fiscal year only in terms
of its servicing.
</P>
<P>
The low rates of investment stagnated at 18 to 20 percent of
GDP, and poor domestic saving rate, fluctuating between 10-15
percent, is very low by the standards in comparable countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, with exports falling well short of targeted 10
billion dollars and imports crossing 12 billion dollar mark, the
trade deficit is expected to reach 3.2 billion dollars by the end
of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe that in this serious situation, the
budget for the next fiscal year will be very tough.
</P>
<P>
The present government of the Pakistan Muslim League (PML) came
to power on February 17, with just the last quarter to go before
the end of the current fiscal year. The new government had to
react promptly to at least arrest further economic decay.
</P>
<P>
The PML government has put forward seven economic reform
packages, primarily aiming to boost exports, reform the banking
system, revive industrial growth and augment capital market to put
the economy back on track.
</P>
<P>
To ease the ever growing debt burden, the government has also
approved a program for privatization of all state-owned
enterprises. It is widely considered as a prime tool to get rid of
the debt burden which has long been a major cause for lower
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the present government has been making great efforts
in reforming the banking sector, most noticeably by granting the
autonomous status to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the
controlling institution of the entire banking network.
</P>
<P>
Through an amendment to the State Bank of Pakistan Act 1956,
the SBP has been given full autonomy in administrative matters. It
has been empowered to decide the limits of the bank borrowing by
the federal and provincial governments from commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Because of the revenue shortfall and the burgeoning budget
deficit, the government's borrowing from commercial banks during
the past few years has been increasing rapidly.
</P>
<P>
The government's bank borrowing in the current fiscal year
alone is expected to reach about 100 billion rupees (about 2.4
billion dollars) as against the revised budget ceiling barrier of
44 billion (1.07 billion dollars) the whole fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
It had led not only to the rising budget deficit but made the
private sector desperately look for working capital, which was
eaten away by the public sector.
</P>
<P>
The budget, to be presented Friday in this dismal backdrop, is
nothing but a serious challenge for the government to turn around
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Debt-servicing and defense expenditure will, as usual, occupy
the top two slots on the expenditure side. In the fiscal 1995-96,
the debt-servicing was 186.1 billion rupees (4.54 billion dollars)
with the defense budget consuming 131.4 billion rupees (3.2
billion dollars) out of the total outlay of 500 billion rupees
(12.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The National Economic Council has already approved the proposed
Public Sector Development Program worth 95 billion (2.3 billion
dollars) for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Aiming to achieve an export target of 10.5 billion dollars, the
government intends to bring down the trade gap to 2 billion
dollars from the current level of more than 3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cutting down the non-development expenditure and increasing the
revenue are believed to be the only two options for the government
to extricate the economy from the current difficult position.
</P>
<P>
The government has already introduced measures to cut down the
current expenditure, and according to Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz
about 30 billion rupees (703 million dollars) has been saved since
the government came to power in mid February.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Direct Talks Help Cyprus Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
formally extended Wednesday invitations to Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to
attend the U.N.-sponsored direct negotiations on the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Annan himself will open the first round of negotiations
scheduled between July 9 and 13 somewhere near New York.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming event will be the first face-to-face meeting
between Clerides and Denktash since October, 1994 when they held
two rounds of informal talks under the U.N. auspices, which ended
in a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Both the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides have responded
positively to the invitations. Government Spokesman Manolis
Christofides described the U.N. move as "the beginning of a new
effort" towards a solution to the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said Wednesday that he would go to the talks with good
will and to defend the rights of the Turkish Cypriot community,
adding "We hope it will be a new beginning with a new spirit."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
took control of the northern third of the island in the wake of a
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Nine years after the division of the island, the Turkish
Cypriot side established a breakaway state "The Turkish Republic
of Northern Cyprus," which is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N., keeping a 1,200-strong peacekeeping force in Cyprus,
has been mediating between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides for
a solution for the past 23 years, but no tangible results have
been achieved so far.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.'s fresh peace initiative started from March this
year, when U.N. Chief's Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave
Feissel conducted the proximity talks between Clerides and
Denktash in an effort to create a right climate for the direct
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Both the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides have shown their
good-will gestures during the talks by announcing the suspension
of the Greek and Turkish military aircraft flying over the Cyprus
air space, thus reducing the tension on the island.
</P>
<P>
However, the prospects of these long-waited direct negotiations
are not so optimistic since differences on main aspects of the
Cyprus problem have remained unsolved between the two sides
despite the U.N.'s shuttle mediations.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Direct Talks Help Cyprus Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fundamental issues of the Cyprus problem, such as
sovereignty, political equality, security, territorial adjustment
and free movement, free settlement and respect of property, are
expected to be on the agenda of the direct talks.
</P>
<P>
Among them, Clerides has singled out security as a key issue
whose solution closely links to the fate of the whole Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side has been advocating a demilitarization
idea, which deprives both communities of armed protection and
entrusts a proposed international force with security
responsibility instead.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, put forward by Clerides in 1993, also suggests
the abolition of the intervention right of Greece, Turkey and
Britain, the guarantors of Cyprus' independence under the 1960
treaty of establishment of the Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
But it has met rejection by Denktash who insisted on the
maintenance of around 30,000 Turkish troops on the island to
protect the Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has also asked the Greek Cypriot side to respect the
Turkish Cypriots' "rights, equality and sovereignty" -- or to
accept the fact "that we shall only be good neighbors in our own
areas."
</P>
<P>
Speaking after conveying the U.N. Chief's invitations to
Clerides and Denktash, U.N. Resident Representative Gustave
Feissel called for contribution from both sides to an overall
settlement, saying "No settlement is possible if one side or the
other side says this or that is out of bounds."
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the forthcoming U.N.-sponsored
direct negotiations will be a step forward in finding a
comprehensive solution to the protracted Cyprus problem, but
expressing an cautious optimism.
</P>
<P>
They echoed statements Wednesday by the newly-appointed U.S.
Presidential Emissary for Cyprus, Richard Holbrooke, that "if
the talks make progress it gives us a little momentum to
build on. If not, at least we will have a clearer picture
where the issues are, so there is no downside to this
meeting."

<HEADLINE> UNSCOM Inspectors Attempt to Smuggle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has formally informed the
U.N. of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) inspectors' attempt
to smuggle articles which are not allowed to be taken out of the
country under Iraqi laws, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
A letter, addressed Wednesday by Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
said Iraq considers the act as violation of its laws and a
flagrant bid to undermine its national economy, as well as a
premeditated contravention of the international norms.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that Iraqi authorities have obtained
information that on June 5, certain UNSCOM inspectors in Iraq
tried to transport illicitly certain articles, which are not
allowed to be taken out of the country under the laws, out of Iraq
through UNSCOM helicopters at an Iraqi airport. The articles are
allegedly in the trunks belonging to the helicopters' pilots.
</P>
<P>
However, neither the letter nor the INA elaborated what the
articles are.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi authorities concerned have informed Nels Karlstrom,
chief of the UNSCOM Monitoring Center in Baghdad, said the
letter.
</P>
<P>
However, Karlstrom refused to attend a joint examination of
the trunks at the airport.
</P>
<P>
This attempt of smuggling is apparently harmful to Iraq's
national interests, the Iraqi foreign minister concluded,
demanding his letter be circulated as a Security Council
document.

ISLAMABAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Islamic Taliban
militia have suffered another setback in two days when opposition
forces today made some territorial gains in eastern Konar
province, Taliban sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban sources in Peshawar, Pakistan's northwestern major
city, said that the Islamic militia lost the Strategic Esmar
valley, which is near Pakistan border and about 200 kilometers
east of Kabul, to the Eastern Shura forces led by some former
government officials there.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban fighters now were retreating to the west to
Asadabad, capital of Kunar province, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Opposition sources also claimed that they have captured three
other districts in Konar province, which has not been confirmed by
independent sources so far.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Islamic Taliban militia were pushed back by
opposing forces led by former military chief Ahmad Masood from
Pul-e-Khomri, capital of northern Baghlan province, where a large
number of Taliban fighters were being trapped.
</P>
<P>
But Taliban sources claimed that it was a "tactic retreat",
adding that the Taliban were preparing a fresh attack on
Pul-e-Khomri, about 150 kilometers north of Kabul.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today expressed regret at continued fighting and
bloodshed in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Turkmen Foreign Minister Boris Shikhmyradov
who arrived here today for a visit to Iran, Rafsanjani said that
military confrontation is not the solution to the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The infighting should be brought to an end through
negotiations and respect for the interests of the Afghan
people," he was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Afghanistan's Taliban militia, in control of most
the country since last year, launched a large-scale offensive
in the north against opposition forces.
</P>
<P>
According to the IRNA report, the Iranian president also
welcomed expansion of bilateral cooperation between Iran and
Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani mentioned the positive outcomes of trilateral
cooperation among Iran, Turkmenistan and Armenia, saying that it
is useful to foster regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Shikhmyradov said that Iran and Turkmenistan have expanded
cooperation in the region and there is no problem in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkmenistan believes that ending civil war in
Afghanistan was a prerequisite for return of peace and security
in that country.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's National
Association for the Blind today called for job opportunity for
blind women.
</P>
<P>
The call came from Tesfanish Beyene, secretary of women's
affair section in the association at a ceremony here to hand- out
certificates to 20 blind women who attended a five-month training
in knitting and other vocations.
</P>
<P>
She noted that 60 blind women trained over the last three
months couldn't get job despite their efficient performance.
</P>
<P>
"The life of these blind women could go even more sour if they
are not given job opportunity in the respective trades they were
trained," she said.
</P>
<P>
She urged pertinent governmental and non-governmental
organizations to address the problem and strive to make blind
women self-reliant.

<HEADLINE> OECD Predicts Fair Economic Growth in Industrialized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) today predicted a 3 percent
average economic growth in 1997 in its 29 industrialized member
countries, the highest in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
But the international organization regretted high public
deficit and high unemployment rate in continental European
countries, notably Germany, France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
In its half-yearly report published today, the OECD said that
the economic growth will drop to 2.7 percent in 1998 in its 29
industrialized member countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States will score a 3.7 percent growth, Germany 2.2
percent, France 2.5 percent and Italy only 1 percent, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The three European powers will have difficulty cutting their
public deficit to below 3 percent of their gross domestic product
(GDP), the criteria set by the European Union Maastricht treaty to
qualify for the euro, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Their public deficit will stand at 3.2 percent of their GDP by
the end of 1997, it said. This estimation conforms with a
previous one made by the International Monetary Fund in April.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Italy's public deficit will rise to 3.8 percent of its
GDP, while those of France and Germany will fall to 3 percent and
2.7 percent of their GDP, it said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Germany, France, Italy, as well as Greece which will
have its public deficit stay at 6 percent by the end of this year,
all other EU countries will cut their public deficit to below 3
percent of their GDP this year, said the OECD report.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment rate stands at an average of 11.2 percent in EU
countries in 1997, compared with 11.3 percent in 1996, and it will
drop to 10.8 percent in 1998, noted OECD.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate in Germany will rise from 10.3 percent in
1996 to 11.1 percent in 1997, France from 12.4 percent to 12.6
percent, and Italy's unemployment rate will stand at 12.1 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
The OECD calls on Germany, France and Italy to reduce their
banking rates and make their labor market more flexible in order
to stimulate growth and cut unemployment.

<HEADLINE> German Bundesbank Optimistic About Resolving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- German central bank, the Bundesbank,
today said it saw "good prospects" for an agreement with the Bonn
government to resolve their row over revaluing the country's gold
reserves.
</P>
<P>
"On the basis of the negotiating results so far, the central
bank council sees good prospects for a solution," said the
Bundesbank central council said in a statement issued after its
regular meeting in Frankfurt Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer
and his deputy, Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, have been asked to continue
the talks with German Finance Minister Theo Waigel in a bid to
negotiate a detailed quick solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
But the Bundesbank gave no indication of how the negotiations
with the government were proceeding and appeared set to insist on
its opposition to transferring the windfall profits generated from
the gold revaluation to the government this year.
</P>
<P>
The Bonn government has triggered a feud with the Bundesbank
with its plan announced last month to revalue the bank's
traditionally undervalued gold reserves in line with market prices
and to use the windfall to reduce the country's massive debt in
order to help Bonn qualify for the planned single European
currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank has warned that the government plan would
infringe on the bank's independence, and risk "a loss in trust in
the stability of the future European currency".
</P>
<P>
While not opposed to using the profits from the gold
revaluation to pay off federal debt, the Bundesbank has been
strongly against being ordered to do so this year.
</P>
<P>
As a compromise, Waigel has proposed to use the money in 1998.
But details of the plan are still under negotiations.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Urges Nations to Close Gender Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) today urged nations to commit
themselves to gender equality in order to unleash the energy and
productive capabilities of women around the world.
</P>
<P>
In its Human Development Report 1997 launched today, UNDP noted
that there is much work to be done in this field.
</P>
<P>
In developing countries, illiterate women outnumber men by 60
percent; women earn only three-fourths of what men earn; women
bear a disproportionately large share of chores and child-bearing
responsibilities; they have less access to land, credit and
employment opportunities. In industrialized countries, the
unemployment rate among women is higher than that among men, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
To help nations monitor their progress in closing the gender
gap, recent editions of the report present two measures of the
disparities in opportunities for men and women around the world.
This year's report includes the following findingds:
</P>
<P>
-- the "Gender-related Development Index," or GDI, measures 146
countries' achievements in life expectancy, educational attainment
and income and compares in status of men and women. Canada, Norway
and Sweden rank the top three, followed by Iceland and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
-- no society treats its women as well as its men as GDI values
in every country are lower than values on a "Human Development
Index", which measures people's well-being;
</P>
<P>
-- gender inequality often accompanies "human poverty," which
reflects limited choices and opportunities; and
</P>
<P>
-- some developing countries outperform much richer
industrialized countries in gender equality in economic and
political opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Remain Prosperous: Mrs. Chennault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The concept of "one country,
two systems" will guarantee sustained prosperity and stability for
Hong Kong after July 1, said Anna Chennault, chairman of the
Council for International Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Mrs. Chennault, widow of
late General Claire Lee Chennault who led the U.S. Air Force
commandos of Flying Tiger against the Japanese invaders in China
during the World War II, expressed her optimism about the future
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The concept of "one country, two systems," proposed by late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, is "a great innovation" and will go
down in history, Mrs. Chennault said.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Chennault, who returned here from Hong Kong two months ago,
said that she was deeply impressed by the patriotism of the people
in Hong Kong during her five-month stay there.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong people, from ordinary citizens to business
leaders, have been actively participating in patriotic
activities," she said. "With Hong Kong's return to the embrace of
the motherland, they will become the masters of Hong Kong. So they
are more confident that they can build Hong Kong into a better
place."
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Chennault also noted that the smooth transition and
sustained economic prosperity and development of Hong Kong would
be a model for the peaceful reunification of the motherland with
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
She said she believes that the differences between the two
sides of the Taiwan Strait will be narrowed through further
negotiations, if they follow the Hong Kong model.
</P>
<P>
People on either side of the Taiwan Strait are Chinese, and
"the issues of the Chinese people should be resolved by
themselves," she stressed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Payment Deal Worries UN Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Diplomats and United
Nations officials were less than enthusiastic today about a deal
worked out by the U.S. Clinton administration and the
Republican-controlled Senate for the payment of the American debt
to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, reportedly reached earlier in the week after
long and tough negotiations between the White House and Congress,
calls for large-scale budget and personnel reductions in the world
body.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported today that at least some of the
U.S. demands that U.S. lawmakers propose to make on the U.N.
reform are unlikely to be accepted by many member countries.
</P>
<P>
Most of the requirements the Clinton administration has agreed
to are beyond the power of the U.S. Congress or the U.S.
government to impose on the organization, the paper pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The deal would only pay 819 million U.S. dollars in delinquent
dues over the next three years. The U.N. has calculated the U.S.
debt at over 1 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Prominent among these U.S. requirements are reductions of
American assessments to 20 percent form 25 percent of the regular
U.N. budget and to 25 percent from 31 percent for U.N.
peacekeeping operations. The original percentage was set by
international agreement.
</P>
<P>
The author of the agreement was U.S. Republican Senator Jesse
Helms, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and
Joseph Biden, ranking Democratic on the committee.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. Congressmen have broken ranks with their colleagues
and argued for full payment of U.S. arrears without conditions.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to decide if we want a strong and viable United
Nations that can serve United States interests or a United Nations
that is crippled by insolvency and hobbled by controversy and
uncertainty," Republican Senator Richard Lugar said in a letter to
Trent Lott, the U.S. Senate majority leader.

<HEADLINE> German Defense Minister Reassures Bonn's Participation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe
said here today that Germany would take part as planned in the
Eurofighter project despite financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting comments made earlier today by Finance Ministry State
Secretary Manfred Overhaus that Germany's defense budgets must be
cut, Ruehe reiterated that he had received pledges from Finance
Minister Theo Waigel on German participation in the
four-European-nation warplane project which also involves Britain,
Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe said earlier this month that he expected the Bonn
government to decide on the purchase of Eurofighter jets before
Summer recess in July.
</P>
<P>
Bonn is currently under huge pressure to tighten budgets and
qualify for the single European currency, the euro, which is due
to be launched from 1999. There remain doubts over how to pay for
the bill for the costly Eurofighter jets.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Italy and Spain have already approved the project.
London plans to buy 232 Eurofighter jets, Rome 121 and Madrid 87.
The German armed forces intends to buy 180. The total price for
the four-nation project is estimated at over 65 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Waigel has proposed to redirect Germany's state aid for the
European Airbus Industrie aircraft consortium to help fund the
planned 23 billion German mark (13.6 billion U.S. dollar)
Eurofighter purchase by Germany.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's President Arrives in Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
arrived today in Libya for a two-day official visit, according to
reports reaching here from Tripoli, capital of Libya.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan news agency quoted an official source as saying
that Mubarak arrived in the northeast city of Tobruk by car, and
immediately held talks with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. The
two leaders were later joined by members of the two countries'
delegations.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is accompanied by a ministerial delegation
comprising Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, Information Minister
Safwat el-Sherif and Finance Minister Mohi Eddin el-Gharib.
</P>
<P>
In an arrival statement, Mubarak said he will exchange views
with Gaddafi on Arab and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will attend during his stay the meetings of a joint
Egyptian-Libyan committee, which will be held later in the day in
Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
The joint committee will consider a plan for a free trade zone
between the two countries and a number of other commercial
projects of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's visit to Libya is taking place 24 hours after Libya
has informed the United Nations about the destructive
consequences of the sanctions imposed against it. The issue of
the sanctions is expected to lead the agenda of the talks between
Mubarak and Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
Libya sent a message to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan Wednesday to the effect that the harm and damages done on
account of the international sanctions had recently been
calculated at some 23.5 billion U.S. dollars, apart from other human
and moral damages sustained by the Libyan people.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been under U.N. sanctions since 1992 after Gaddafi
refused to hand over two Libyans suspected in the 1988 bombing of
an American airliner over Locherbie, Scotland that killed 270
people.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Defends U.S. Favor for Three Countries for NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- United States Defense Secretary
William Cohen defended on Thursday his government's choice for
only three new members to join NATO in the first group by saying
that this would underscore that there was going to be addiSmaller enlargement, b
ut this move is said to have shocked some
member states, including France, which has pushed for a broader
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
France, together with some southern European NATO states, has
been voicing strong support for membership of Romania and
Slovenia, in an attempt to balance the expansion to the east with
a "southern strategy".
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the defense ministers' meeting, Mr
Cohen said that the U.S. approach was appropriate given the fact
that NATO's door would remain open and that there would be ample
opportunities to invite additional members.
</P>
<P>
He argued that by limiting the numbers of new members the
problem of cost of enlargement would be diminished.
</P>
<P>
"A limit initial group will underscore that the process is a
deliberate one,...and there is going to be additional rounds," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Secretary added that the first group of countries
to be invited should enjoy strong consensus since this was "such a
momentous decision" for the alliance.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General told reporters after the meeting that
the final decision had not yet been taken on which countries would
join in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the United States was "a very important
country" in the alliance and that its position would have "without
any doubt a weight" on the decision NATO would finally make.

JOHANNESBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is planning to
close five of its border posts with land-locked neighboring
Swaziland as part of the drive to combat cross-border crime.
</P>
<P>
South African Customs Union spokesman Christo Henning said in

part of a national exercise to scale down the number of exit and
entry points into South Africa, reported the African Eye News

</P>
<P>
The closure was also part of South Africa's national crime
prevention strategy and was aimed at reducing the influx of
smuggled and fake goods, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Only six of the current 11 border posts with Swaziland would
be retained. Some of the border posts expected to be closed were
still operating but would be phased out before the end of the
year.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Affirms China's Success in Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China has made impressive
reductions in human poverty in the past 45 years, the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) reported here today.
</P>
<P>
In its just-released Human Development Report 1997, the UN
agency said that between 1949 and 1995 China reduced infant
mortality from 200 per 1,000 live births to 42, and increased life
expectancy at birth from 35 years to 69.
</P>
<P>
"Today almost all children go to school and adult illiteracy,
80 percent in the 1950s, has fallen to 19 percent," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The report devoted two pages to China's remarkable progress in
poverty-reduction since 1978.
</P>
<P>
In 1978 the government, concerned about rural poverty, carried
out a special investigation that concluded that 260 million people
lived below the poverty line -- a third of the rural population.
Since then Chinese government took measures to attack rural
poverty, including land reform, market orientation, price reform
of farm produce.
</P>
<P>
By mid-1995, the number of rural people living in income
poverty fell to 65 million, presenting a 75 percent decrease of
poverty-plagued population in less than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
However, China still faces the following challenges in the
fields as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- Up to a third of rural population has an inadequate supply
of drinking water -- 130 million people use untreated surface
water contaminated by domestic, industrial or agro-chemical
wastes, and 43 million people live in water-scarce areas;
</P>
<P>
-- 97 percent of the rural population do not have access to
adequate sanitation;
</P>
<P>
-- health services in poor rural areas are still inferior to
those in cities;
</P>
<P>
-- more than 2 million children were not enrolled in school in
1991-92;
</P>
<P>
Though China has achieved great progress in recent decades,
there is a long way to go before China eliminates income poverty
-- and even further before it eradicates human poverty, UNDP
report stressed.

<HEADLINE> Vehicle Theft on Increase in Swaziland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- An unprecedented surge in
violent vehicle hijackings in Swaziland has prompted police to
launch a series of spot roadblocks and vehicle searches in the
land-locked kingdom, a local press report said today.
</P>
<P>
Swazi police spokesman Victor Dlamini said in Mbabane, capital
of the kingdom, that 107 of 299 vehicles stolen since January
were taken at gun point, reported African Eye News Service.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini said the Royal Swazi Police had already recovered 165
of the 299 stolen vehicles, an over 50 percent recovery rate.
</P>
<P>
"The worst month for vehicle theft this year is January, when
thieves stole 69 cars and for some reason during May, when they
took 65 vehicles," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Swazi police cracked a syndicate channelling stolen
cars from southern Africa to as far afield as Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Because of the trans-national nature of the thieves'
opeations, countries in the region have recently established a
"frontlie" crack police squad to combat vehicle theft syndicates.
</P>
<P>
The squad comprises officers from South Africa, Zimbabwe,
Mozambique and Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Rise in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria recorded a 3.9 percent
price increase in March from the previous month, the Federal
Office of Statistics (FOS) said today.
</P>
<P>
The composite consumer price index (CPI), a measurement of FOS
for consumer price rises, stood at 2830.7 in March, according to
the latest edition of Statistical News, a FOS publication.
</P>
<P>
The government agency attributed the rise to significant
increases in the prices of food items and in the cost of
services.
</P>
<P>
In March, urban and rural indices registered increases of 2.8
percent and 4.4 percent, respectively, as against February, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the same period last year, the average annual
rate of rise of consumer retail prices moved up by 22.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The composite food index rose by 5.7 percent due to "substantial
increases in the prices of the staple food, vegetables and
fruits."
</P>
<P>
The "all items excluding farm produce" index rose slightly by
0.9 percent in March as against a decline in February.
</P>
<P>
The agency said the March CPI figure also indicated that the
retail prices of goods and services purchased by consumers in
both urban and rural areas rose by 28.3 times between September
1985 and March this year.

<HEADLINE> House of Representatives Passes Constitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives voted 310-114 Thursday for a proposed
constitutional amendment against flag desecration, an issue pushed
by conservatives since Republicans took over Congress in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the measure faces an uncertain future in the Senate where
it failed two years ago after an equally strong show of support by
the House.
</P>
<P>
It was Congress' third attempt to approve the amendment since a
1989 Supreme Court decision said burning the U.S. flag was a form
of speech protected by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The flag amendment's future also is in doubt because
controversial social issues advocated by many conservatives that
would involve changing the Constitution haven't fared well in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Amendments to require balanced budgets have passed the House,
but lost narrowly twice in the Senate. Another to limit the terms
of federal lawmakers was defeated in 1995 and earlier this year,
while the flag amendment failed in 1990 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
Constitutional amendments require approval by two-thirds of the
House and Senate and ratification by three-quarters of the states.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendment would not outlaw flag desecration but
would authorize Congress to do so. It says, "The Congress shall
have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the
United States."
</P>
<P>
Proposals for the amendment stem from the 1989 Supreme Court
ruling that overturned statutes in 48 states. Congress then passed
a law protecting the flag, but the high court declared it
unconstitutional in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Congress failed to get a two-thirds majority that year for a
constitutional amendment. The House voted 312-120 in favor of a
similar measure in 1995, but the Senate fell four votes short of
the needed support.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today announced his support for Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in
the first wave of expansion.
</P>
<P>
"After careful consideration, I've decided that the United
States will support inviting three countries -- Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic -- to begin accession talks to join NATO
when we meet in Madrid next month," U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Clinton formally expressed support
for the three to join NATO first. Some Western European nations
insist that Romania and Slovenia should also be included in the
first group.
</P>
<P>
"We have said all along that we would judge aspiring members by
their ability to add strength to the alliance and their readiness
to shoulder the obligations of NATO membership," Clinton said in
the written statement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic
clearly meet those criteria and have currently made the greatest
strides in military capacity and political and economic reform.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton said that the door for NATO membership will be
open.
</P>
<P>
"As I have repeatedly emphasized, the first new members should
not and will not be the last. We will continue to work with other
interested nations such as Slovenia and Romania to help them
prepare for membership," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Other nations are making good progress, and none will be
excluded from consideration," he added.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Pledges Support for Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
today reaffirmed that his country will extend any kind of support
to Albania's development.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with visiting Albanian Prime Minister
Bashkim Fino, Demirel said that Albania is a friendly country
of Turkey, adding Ankara is willing to help the Albanian people
overcome their current difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Demirel expressed the hope that Albania can play a special role
in promoting peace and stability in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the forthcoming Albanian general elections on June
29, the Turkish president said that he believes that the Albanian
people will heal their wounds through the elections.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Fino said that Albania attaches great importance
to its ties with Turkey, adding that his visit to Ankara will
further enhance friendship and cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Fino also expressed his gratitude for Turkey's
50-million-U.S. dollar aid promise to his country.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan and
Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller also met with Fino, and both of
Erbakan and Ciller expressed Turkey's support for the
turbulence-hit Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that peace in Albania is important for the peace of
the whole region, Erbakan said "we wish the Albanian people to
overcome their present difficulties and to maintain its
integration with Europe."
</P>
<P>
Ciller, also Turkey's deputy prime minister, told Fino that
Turkey hopes that its participation in the multinational
peacekeeping force will contribute to Albania's peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian prime minister, accompanied by cabinet ministers
and other senior officials, arrived here on Wednesday for a
two-day official visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the aim of Fino's Ankara tour is to
seek economic aid from the Turkish government to boost his
country's sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
The high-ranking Albanian delegation also wants Turkey to
increase its investments in Albania and to help reconstruct its
armed forces, which is described by Fino as almost totally
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
At present, Turkey has 850 troops in Albania, as part of the
6,000-strong multinational peacekeeping troops stationed there to
assist local army and police in keeping order.
</P>
<P>
Political turmoil has brought Albania, the poorest country in
Europe, to the brink of a civil war recently and also caused serious
refugee problem, which aroused grave concern from the
international community.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Group Wants Turkish Military Operation to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP), one of the major rival parties in northern Iraq, has asked
Turkey to continue its military operation until the situation
there is stable.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's semi-official Anatolia News Agency today quoted KDP
officials as saying that the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) rebels, who had earlier escaped into Iran after suffering
hard hit by the Turkish forces, returned to the Iranian-Iraqi
border area again.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the Turkish government troops should
not withdraw from northern Iraq until an effective order was
established in the region.
</P>
<P>
The reports, however, failed to tell when and where the KDP
officials made such an appeal.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the KDP officials also accused the outlawed
Hazbollah organization of assisting PKK in an attempt to attack
the KDP again in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
They said that those PKK rebels had received medical treatment
in several camps and hideouts in the Iranian villages after they
escaped this country to flee Turkish troops' offensive.
</P>
<P>
On the request of the KDP, about 50,000-strong Turkish
government troops launched a massive cross-border military
operation in northern Iraq on May 14 to wipe out the outlowed PKK
separatist rebels.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's military attack has drawn criticism from many
countries, especially neighbors, who accused Ankara of violating
Iraq's independence and territorial integrity, demanding an early
pull-out of the Turkish troops from the region.
</P>
<P>
In response to the criticism, Turkey alleged that its military
operation was aimed at eliminating the threat of PKK to its border
area, describing it as a hit against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Despite a denial from Iran, Turkey has been accusing Iran
of backing the PKK rebels in eastern and southeastern Turkey
and trying to export its Islamic revolution to the secular
republic.
</P>
<P>
Turkey military said last week that Iran, among several other
countries, had supplied PKK with sophisticated anti-aircraft
missiles, which were used to shoot down two Turkey's military
choppers.

<HEADLINE> US Treasury Department Unveils New Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Treasury Department
unveiled a new 50-dollar bill today aimed at preventing
counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
The new currency, to be issued this fall, is the second batch
of U.S. currency to include new and modified security features to
stay ahead of advances in reprographic technology. The newly
designed 100-dollar bill was issued in March 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 50-dollar bills will replace the older series gradually as
they reach U.S. Federal Reserve banks. About 46.5 billion dollars
in 50-dollar notes are in circulation.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the large number "50" on the back of the
notes, the redesigned bills include:
</P>
<P>
--A larger portrait of President Ulysses Grant, moved
off-center to create space for a watermark to the right which can
be seen only when held up to light.
</P>
<P>
--A security thread to the right of the portrait that glows
yellow when exposed to ultraviolet light. "USA FIFTY" and a flag,
which contains microprinting, are printed on the thread.
</P>
<P>
--Color-shifting ink in the numeral on the lower right-hand
corner of the bill front that changes from green to black when
viewed from different angles.
</P>
<P>
--Microprinting in the border and in Grant's shirt collar.
</P>
<P>
--Concentric fine-line printing in the background of the
portrait and on the back of the note.
</P>
<P>
--The engraving of the Capitol on the new bill has been
enlarged to include more detail and reflects a contemporary view
of the west front of the building.
</P>
<P>
"With this redesign, government demonstrates its ability to
stay ahead of the technology curve and meet the needs of all those
people around the world who use and trust our currency," U.S.
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said in a ceremony at the Bureau
of Engraving and Printing.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the introduction of the new 100-dollar bill was
extremely effective against counterfeiters using advanced
technologies including color copiers, scanners and printers.

racial and economic conditions in the South.
</P>
<P>
The official said Harvard University law professor Christopher

<HEADLINE> Uganda's GDP Growth Stands at 5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's growth rate of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) stood at five percent during the 1996/97
financial year.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Minister of Finance and Economic
Planning Mayanja-Nkangi here today while presenting to parliament
the annual budget for the 1997/98 financial year.
</P>
<P>
The rate is lower than the GDP growth rate of the 1995/96
financial year which stood at 8.2 percent and that of 1994/95 at
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is also lower than a 6.5 average registered between 1986
and 1990.
</P>
<P>
Observers here attributed the lower growth to the war against
the rebel Lord's Resistance Army in the north in the previous
financial year.
</P>
<P>
However, Nkangi said that the economy is now moving beyond
rehabilitation and adjustment stage which started in 1987 towards
the development phase.
</P>
<P>
He told the nation that the government is committed to
macro-economic stability and fiscal consolidation, arguing that
the central government expenditure in 1996/97 was contained
within the provisions of the overall macro-economic framework
despite a significant shortfall in revenue.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government's medium-term development
strategy is to promote economic growth of at least five percent per
annum, sustain macro-economic stability, reduce poverty and
create an enabling and conducive environment for private sector
investment in order to stimulate national economic growth.

KAMPALA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's total stock of external
debt has increased to 3.6 billion U.S. Dollars at the end of
December 1996 from 3.28 billion U.S. Dollars at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Minister of Finance and Economic
Planning Mayanja-Nkangi here today when presenting to parliament

</P>
<P>
However, the debt burden is moving towards sustainable levels
as a result of the debt relief initiatives from international
communities and the government's efforts to boost exports.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that government's fiscal program for the
next three years will seek to reduce the overall fiscal deficit
to sustainable levels #,to increase government savings, and to
finance essential government expenditures.

<HEADLINE> NATO Defense Ministers Meet to Prepare Madrid Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- NATO's defense ministers of 16
member countries ended here today their semi-annual meeting at
which they were doing the final work to prepare NATO's landmark
summit in Madrid less than a month away.
</P>
<P>
Major topics at today's meeting included the situation in
Bosnia and NATO's peacekeeping mission there, and NATO's plans for
wide-ranging reforms.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministers were briefed at the meeting by General
George Joulwan, the outgoing Supreme Allied Commander Europe of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, on the first six months of
operations by NATO's peacekeeping Stabilization Force.
</P>
<P>
They also strongly called on all Parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina
to implement the Dayton peace accord "fully and without further
delay."
</P>
<P>
On NATO's internal reform, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
told a press conference after the meeting that the phased
implementation of the Combined Joint Task Force concept, which
makes the future European-only operation possible, was "proceeding
well."
</P>
<P>
As for the rearrangement of the alliance's command structure,
he said, "Some issues remain to be agreed," referring to the still
unsolved U.S.-France dispute for control of NATO's joint command
headquarters, Allied Forces Southern Europe, in Naples, Italy.
</P>
<P>
France has been demanding the post in the Southern Region,
which is always held by an American general, to be handed over to
a European officer in order to make the European defense identity
more visible within NATO, but the suggestion is rejected by the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters that he had
met with the new French Defense Minister Alain Richard at the
meeting and was told that the French position on this matter had
not changed.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the U.S. and France had been put on hold because
of the French election last week. Cohen said that he was not sure
when the talks would be resumed.
</P>
<P>
On external relations, the ministers worked on the terms of the
new NATO-Russia Council, created by the bilateral accord signed by
Russia and NATO on May 27.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Cohen presented Washington's position on which
countries should be invited to join the alliance in the first wave
at the Madrid summit on July 8 and 9.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. wanted only three countries, Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic, to be included in the first
accession group.
</P>
<P>
Even though it has already been clear for some time that
Washington favored a smaller enlargement, this move is said to
have shocked some member states, including France, which has
pushed for a broader enlargement.
</P>
<P>
France, together with some southern European NATO states, has
been voicing strong support for membership of Romania and
Slovenia, in an attempt to balance the expansion to the east with
a "southern strategy."
</P>
<P>
This morning, the defense ministers also met as 15 -- without
France -- within NATO's Defense Planning Committee and the Nuclear
Planning Group, discussing routine questions related to the
defense review for the next two years in the integrated military
structure.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming the signing of the NATO-Russia Act, the defense
ministers said they looked forward to reciprocal exchanges with
Russia on nuclear weapons issues, including doctrine and strategy
and consultations on nuclear safety issues.
</P>
<P>
They also renewed their call to Russia to bring to completion
the reductions in its tactical nuclear weapons announced in 1991
and 1992 and to consider making additional significant reductions.

UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
decided today to extend the mandate of the U.N. Mission of
Observers in Tajikistan for a period of three months until 15
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
In adopting the resolution, the Security Council reaffirmed its
commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
Republic of Tajikistan and to the inviolability of its borders.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over the still precarious security and
humanitarian situation, the council called on the parties to
implement fully the agreements reached in the inter-Tajik talks
and encouraged them to sign the General Agreement on the
Establishment of Peace and National Accord in Tajikistan as a
priority.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Revenue for 1997/98 Expected to Reach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's total revenue for
1997/98 fiscal year is expected to reach 840 billion Ugandan
Shillings (about 840 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
This was announced bys Minister of Finance and Economic
Planning Mayanja-Nkangi here today while presenting to parliament
the annual budget for the 1997/98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, excludes taxes on the government and donor
funded procurements.
</P>
<P>
He said, of this total, 829 billion Shillings are expected to
be generated locally from the Uganda Revenue Authority (URA)
collections and other taxes. The balance of 11 billion Shillings
will come from appropriations in aid.
</P>
<P>
However, for the first time, this year's budget speech
contained no increment in salaries of civil servants.
</P>
<P>
For this, Nkangi explained that the combination of revenue
shortfall, the local government elections to be held in September
this year and the doubling of primary school enrolment in 1997
mean that all areas of government will have to make some
sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
In the budget proposals, Nkangi said the objectives
of the 1997/98 financial year revenue strategies are:
</P>
<P>
1. to revamp the administration of URA;
</P>
<P>
2. to simplify, modernise and consolidate tax-laws;
</P>
<P>
3. to make some significant reforms in taxation, to
promote trade liberalisation, international competitiveness and
relief on poverty;
</P>
<P>
And to make a substantial move fowards having a more
imform, more transparent and much simpler tax system.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Supports Three New Members in NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today announced his support for Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in
the first wave of its expansion.
</P>
<P>
"After careful consideration, I've decided that the United
States will support inviting three countries -- Poland, Hungary
and the Czech Republic -- to begin accession talks to join NATO
when we meet in Madrid next month," said President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Clinton formally expressed support
for the three to join NATO first. Some Western European nations
insist that Romania and Slovenia should also be included in the
first group.
</P>
<P>
"We have said all along that we would judge aspiring members by
their ability to add strength to the alliance and their readiness
to shoulder the obligations of NATO membership," Clinton said in
the written statement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic
clearly meet those criteria and have currently made the greatest
strides in military capacity and political and economic reform.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton said that the door for NATO membership will be
open.
</P>
<P>
"As I have repeatedly emphasized, the first new members should
not and will not be the last. We will continue to work with other
interested nations such as Slovenia and Romania to help them
prepare for membership," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Other nations are making good progress, and none will be
excluded from consideration," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen formally presented to
the allies the U.S. position today at the defense ministers'
meeting in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Asked why Clinton decided to announce the support until today,
White House spokesman Michael McCurry said, "Achieving consensus
is helped by the United States clarifying publicly its views."
</P>
<P>
"It's clear in the discussions we've had so far that there
are no objections to these three entrants," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Slovenia, McCurry said that it still is in a
position where there is more they can do to fully demonstrate the
military capacity to join the alliance and to fulfill the military
obligations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Romania, McCurry said the country needs "some
progress" in both economic areas and the political reform process.
</P>
<P>
NATO is expected to convene a special summit in July in Madrid
to choose the first group of countries that it will accept as its
new members by 1999.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, Cohen cited three main reasons for limiting the
Madrid invitations to three: the smaller the initial expansion,
the more cohesiveness NATO will retain; the bigger the expansion,
the higher the bills; concern that the initial expansion not be
perceived as the last.

<HEADLINE> Stable Grain Market in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China's grain supply has basically
caught up with its demand so far this year, leading to a stable
grain market nationwide, according to the China Price Information
Center.
</P>
<P>
Grain output in Chine hit a record 480 billion kg last year,
giving a boost to grain in stock.
</P>
<P>
The country's demand for feed grain and that for industrial use
has climbed in recent years, compared with the slight drop in the
citizens' demand for grain.
</P>
<P>
The average annual consumption of grain per capita went down
from 130 kg in 1990 to 97 kg in 1995 in the country's urban areas,
and from 262 kg to 259 kg in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
These have led to a stable grain price in the country, the
center said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Seeks U.N. Chief's Help in Pressing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has called on
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to stop the U.S. from causing
the delay in the approval of Iraqi oil-for-food contracts,
according to the Iraqi News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Annan released by INA today, Iraq's Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf asked the U.N. chief "to urge
the government of the United States to stop using the (U.N.)
Sanctions Committee as a tool to delay the approval of the
contracts through presenting unfounded and unnecessary pretexts."
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf accused the U.S. representative to the Sanctions
Committee of "delaying the approval of the contracts to achieve
ill-intentioned political goals and thus prolonging the
sufferings of the Iraqi people who have been living under a
comprehensive embargo for seven years now."
</P>
<P>
The letter, dated June 11, said that during the first six
months of the oil-for-food deal, the U.S. representative to the
committee suspended 166 contracts out of 669 presented to the
committee's secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food deal, which signed in May last year, allows
Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars of oil over six months on a
renewable basis to buy humanitarian goods for its people who were
hit by the U.N.-imposed sanctions on Iraq since its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait. It has been renewed for another six months from June 7.
</P>
<P>
However, every contract for such goods signed by Iraq and
foreign companies must be approved unanimously by the
U.N. Sanctions Committee in advance, consisting of representatives
of all the 15 U.N. Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent security council member, the U.S. insists that
the U.N. impose tight control to make sure the supplies are
distributed fairly and not used for military purpose.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) has finalised its test to detect the drug
erythropoietin (EPO), IOC member Jacques Rogge said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The test is ready, EPO can be traced but we still need to
cover ourselves better legally," Rogge told the Belgian Het
Nieuwsblad newspaper in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Rogge, who is also chairman of the federation of European
National Olympic Committees, said "the door will certainly be
closed" for EPO users at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
EPO, which stimulates the production of red blood cells which
transport oxygen around the body, is considered one of the most
dangerous drugs. Extended use can thicken the blood and cause
heart attacks, studies have shown.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Rogge said there was also a 50 percent chance that the
human growth hormone, seen as the ideal substitute for steroids,
could be traced by Sydney 2000.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women's Status Rising, Problems Still Remain: Survey (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A recent official survey indicates
that Chinese women's political and social status has risen
steadily over the years, yet their legitimate rights must be
further protected by law.
</P>
<P>
The presence of Chinese women in the political arena has become
more and more common, and their personal rights and those of their
employment and education are well ensured, according to the survey
on how the Law on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests
is being enforced by local governments.
</P>
<P>
Because the social and economic situations are changing fast
and conditions differ in various locations, women's rights are not
fully protected and in some places are seriously violated, the
survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Three survey groups were sent to provinces of Shanxi, Sichuan
and Guangdong last month by the Civil and Judicial Affairs
Committee under the National People's Congress (NPC). Five other
provinces were ordered to conduct self-examinations and
self-evaluations.
</P>
<P>
They presented their results to a committee meeting attended by
senior lawmaker and top women's rights activist Chen Muhua, who
is vice-chairwoman of the NPC Standing Committee and president of
the All-China Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
It was reported at the meeting that the number and ratio of
women officials and deputies to people's congresses are up in all
the provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions surveyed.
</P>
<P>
A breakthrough has been made in Shanxi Province, where for many
years there had not been a female official at the provincial level
in the provincial government. And a female city party chief, a
female mayor and a female head of the prefectural people's
congress have been selected in the province.
</P>
<P>
In Sichuan Province, there are one to two percent more deputies
to township, county and provincial people's congresses than in the
previous term of office.
</P>
<P>
Women may be especially hard-hit by the wave of reforms to
unprofitable state enterprises, according to reports at the
meeting. To help re-employ laid-off women, local governments have
encouraged the development of the service sector and tried to find
other employment avenues for women.
</P>
<P>
Following these measures, Changzhi County of Shanxi Province
hired more women, and now females comprise 47 percent of its total
work force.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women's Status Rising, Problems Still Remain: Survey (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To curb sex discrimination against women in the workplace,
local governments have set rules demanding that employers hire a
designated percentage of women. The number of female workers in
Sichuan Province, for the first time in history, increased faster
than that of the males.
</P>
<P>
All the reports claimed provincial governments have emphasized
the need to safeguard women's rights to personal safety, and
equality in marriage, family and possessions. As a result of
China's "Strike Hard" anti-crime campaign, the crimes of
kidnapping women and the number of women abducted have decreased
in the past two years in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong Province sentenced 79.6 percent of the criminals
convicted of cruelly injuring or killing women to five or more
years in prison, or even execution, in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Many places have formulated specific rules and regulations to
ensure equality between men and women.
</P>
<P>
In terms of education, statistics from the places surveyed show
that more than 97 percent of the eligible female children are now
in school. In prosperous Guangdong Province, the number of
illiterate women is near zero.
</P>
<P>
But the gender gap still exists. For instance, according to the
reports, women's involvement in politics is at a
far-from-satisfactory level, women are still discriminated in
workplaces, and their situations in overseas, private and township
enterprises have not been improved.
</P>
<P>
In some places, family violence is up, and bigamist marriages
and extra-marital affairs are becoming prevalent.
</P>
<P>
After listening to these reports, Chen Muhua said, "We may
fully affirm our achievements in protecting the rights and
interests of women, but should never overestimate them."
</P>
<P>
She believed the most effective solution for all the problems
found in the survey is to educate society about the Law on the
Protection of Women's Rights and Interests.
</P>
<P>
"By doing so, we may make women realize that they can resort to
legal means to tackle their problems, and let men be aware that
the problems of the opposite sex are not only the problems of
individuals, but of the whole society," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the key segment of those to be educated
should be officials of the male sex. Women's organizations and
activists should forward their suggestions on specific matters,
she added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the ongoing national move to promote ethical and
cultural progress should also focus on the issues of bigamy and
extra-marital affairs, for they are serious moral and social
problems, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The sexual revolution in the West has produced some harmful
trends that should be prevented, and some of China's own backward
customs should be reformed to protect the equality of sexes, she
said.

<HEADLINE> France Rules Out Intervention in Congo Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- France today ruled out any
intervention in the continued fighting in the Congo Republic, or
in joining any kind of interposing force in the country.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said the
1,200 French soldiers in Congo are "exclusively" for evacuating
foreign expatriates.
</P>
<P>
"This detachment does not have any vocation to intervene in the
fighting or participate in whatever interposing force," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former Congolese President Denis Sassou N'Guesso, who is head
of one side in the fighting, said in a telephone interview with
the French daily "Le Figaro" that an international force should be
deployed to secure the presidential election on July 27.
</P>
<P>
So far French troops have evacuated 3,420 foreign expatriates,
half of them French nationals, from Brazzaville on military
aircraft to neighboring Gabon.
</P>
<P>
Rummelhardt said France agreed to participate in a meeting of
"plenipotentiaries" of Congo as was proposed by Gabonese President
Omar Bongo, to seek a solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sassou N'Guesso today accused President Pascal
Lissouba of using Angola's UNITA rebel soldiers as mercenaries to
fend off his "Cobra" militiamen.
</P>
<P>
He said an Antonov aircraft of the Congo air company is
"ensuring regularly the transport of arms between the UNITA zone
of Angola and Pointe-Noire" in western Congo, and a Lebanese man
was running the transport of armaments between Pointe-Noire and
Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
Sassou N'Guesso Thursday asked French troops to stop Lissouba
from receiving reinforcements from the Brazzaville airport.

<HEADLINE> EU Presents New Law to Beef up CITES </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today

Endangered Species (CITES).
</P>

Head of EU delegation Wim Wessels told the press conference at

</P>
<P>
Under the new law which came in to effect on June 1, the

<HEADLINE> NPC Standing Committee Refutes EU Commission's Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A solemn statement on the
resolution of the Commission of the European Union (EU) on a Long
Term Policy for Europe-China Relations, issued today by the
Foreign Affairs Committee of China's National People's Congress
(NPC), warned that the resolution has "poisoned the atmosphere of
Sino-European relations and disrupted their normal development."
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued with the authorization of the NPC
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was adopted by the European Parliament on June
12. The statement of the NPC Foreign Affairs Committee said that
although the resolution supports the European Union's long term
China policy and wishes to develop relations and cooperation with
China in the economic, trade, cultural and other fields, the
resolution unjustifiably accuses and vilifies China at great
length in terms of its judicial system, its policies towards
minorities and religion, its domestic economic policies and
foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, its wording on the issues of human rights, Tibet,
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao constitutes a gross interference in
China's internal affairs," the statement pointed out, adding that
the resolution advocates for Taiwan's membership in international
organizations and has even gone so far as to suggest that the
efforts for the reunification across the Taiwan Straits would
"lead to conflict".
</P>
<P>
"This resolution adopted by the European Parliament has
poisoned the atmosphere of China-Europe relations and thus
disrupted their normal development. The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress hereby expresses its utmost indignation
at the anti-China clamor of this Resolution."
</P>
<P>
It said that to promote peace and development is the mainstream
of the world today, and that to seek mutual respect and equality,
oppose power politics and hegemonism, and promote dialogue and
cooperation and refrain from confrontation and conflicts -- this
has increasingly become the consensus of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
But some people in the European Parliament, still with the
Cold-War mentality and the old colonialist ideas, hate to see
China develop and grow strong, it said, and that they have
repeatedly instigated the European Parliament to adopt anti-China
resolutions, thereby interfering in China's internal affairs,
damaging China's image and hurting the feelings of the Chinese
people, in a premeditated, but vain attempt to confront China and
obstruct its development.
</P>
<P>
"These perverse acts of theirs have run counter to the desires
of the European Union and its members for better relations with
China and have impaired their efforts in this regard," the
statement noted, adding that furthermore, they have also blemished
the very image of the European Parliament itself and will
undoubtedly damage the fundamental and long-term interests of the
peoples of the European Union eventually.
</P>
<P>
"It is only over ten days before China's resumption of the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, which is a significant
step forward in our efforts to accomplish the great cause of the
reunification of the motherland," the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that Macao will smoothly return to
China in two years' time, and that Taiwan will also return to the
embrace of the motherland eventually.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people have long stood up and have firmly embarked
upon the broad road of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics. Those in the European Parliament who have tried
to change China according to their will by exerting pressure have
apparently miscalculated the situation, No one can stop China from
getting reunified, prosperous and powerful."
</P>
<P>
The statement continued that China has always pursued an
independent foreign policy of peace and is willing to develop
friendly relations and cooperation with all other countries in the
world including member states of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
China's National People's Congress attaches importance to the
development of relations with the European Parliament. But their
relations can only be based on mutual respect, equality and mutual
non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to seriously demand these people in the European
Parliament that they should discard the Cold-War mentality,
conform to the trend of the times and do something useful for the
healthy development of China-Europe relations and for world peace
and progress," the statement concluded.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Lags Behind in Income, Human Development: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A Nepali expert said here today
that Nepal is the poorest even among South Asian countries not
only in per capita income, but also in most of the key human
indicators, such as adult literacy, mother and child mortality,
food consumption and provision of water and health services.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kishor Guru-Gharana, a member of the Nepali National
Planning Commission, made a presentation on the 1997 Human
Development Report (HDR) from Nepalese perspective at a press
conference held here by the United Nations Development Programme
to launch the HDR, which focuses on poverty eradication through
human development and other strategies.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Guru-Gharana said Nepal was placed at 151 last year among
174 countries in the world, this year it stands at 154 on a list
of 175 countries, only above Bhutan among the seven South Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
But Nepal lags behind more in human progress than in economic
achievement, noted Dr. Guru-Gharana, saying Nepal has to pay
special attention to gender issues because it is one of the two
exceptional countries in the world with life expectancy of women
less than that of men.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Nepalese women lag far behind men in literacy,
access to education, health services, land and credit, while their
workload is considered one of the largest in the world, on average
about 40 percent larger than men, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Guru-Gharana said in preparation of the Ninth Five Year
Plan (1997-2002), Nepal has given due consideration to the
development strategies suggested in the HDR.
</P>
<P>
For example, the ninth plan gives high attention to ending all
kinds of disparities and discriminations between men and women
through increased access of females to education, health, land and
job opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
And the National Planning Commission has listed poverty
eradication within a given time frame through pro-poor growth and
employment -friendly strategies as the overriding objective of the
ninth plan, he added.

<HEADLINE> IAAF Likely to Issue Wild Cards for Johnson and Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- World athletics governing body IAAF
is likely to offer "wild card" invitations to Michael Johnson and
other top U.S. athletes who don't qualify for the World
Championships.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, USA Track and Field said
Thursday it would support the move if the International Amateur
Athletic Federation awarded wild cards for the Aug. 1-10 world
championships in Athens, Greece.
</P>
<P>
"This is like an open door,"' IAAF spokesman Giorgio Reineri
said Friday. "It's now in the hands of the IAAF to decide. The IAAF
has the possibility to invite the reigning world champions, and
maybe the world record-holder."
</P>
<P>
IAAF president Primo Nebiolo has said he is not against the idea.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team for the World Championships is determined by the
U.S. nationals, which are being held this week in Indianapolis. The
first three finishers in most events qualify.
</P>
<P>
But many big stars such like Johnson, Dan O'Brien, Gwen
Torrence, Mike Powell and Carl Lewis are among the top names
missing from the nationals.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the 1995 world champion and 1996 Olympic gold medalist
in the 200 and 400 meters, is out with a strained left quadriceps
suffered during his 150-match race agianst Donovan Bailey on June 1.
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, the three-time world champion and Olympic gold medalist
in the decathlon, missed the national championships because of a
stress fracture of the right tibia.

BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Wannian, vice-chairman of
the Central Military Commission (CMC), today urged the army to
fully understand the urgency of strengthening logistics management.
</P>
<P>
Zhang made the comments at a meeting which was held today to
study and implement Chinese President and CMC Chairman Jiang
Zemin's instructions on scientific management being the best way
to strengthen army building.
</P>
<P>
All top Chinese leaders have been placing great emphasis on the
army's logistics management, Zhang noted, adding that the
development of a modern army places higher demands on military
management.
</P>
<P>
He called on the whole army to expand its fine traditions of
hard work and thriftiness, and urged military officials at various
levels to improve rules and regulations on logistics work.
</P>
<P>
As China is facing new circumstances and new problems, the army
should be active in exploring scientific and effective ways in
logistics management in order to meet the needs of socialist
market economy and the actual conditions of the army, Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Economic Growth Continues in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The German economy continued to grow
in the second quarter of this year, but will have to expand
further in order to meet the government target for a 2.5 percent
growth for the year as a whole, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The June economic report of the German Economics Ministry
Friday did not mention any figure for second quarter growth, but
said conditions for a further acceleration of the economy "remain
favorable".
</P>
<P>
There were expansions both in foreign orders and domestic
demand, the report said. Production was also clearly above the
level of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the report also registered continuing weakness in
private consumption and a slack construction sector.
</P>
<P>
Germany's gross domestic product (GDP) expanded by 1.4 percent
in the first quarter of this year after zero growth in the fourth
quarter of 1996. The latest report of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) predicted that the
German economy would grow by 2.2 percent in 1997 and 2.8 percent
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Capital Supports Cash Crop Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Capital Territory
(FCT), where the Nigerian capital is located, is to distribute 24
tons of assorted cash crop seeds to about 36,600 farmers this
farming season through its agricultural development project
(ADP).
</P>
<P>
At present, enough chemicals to cover about 150 hectares of
land have been acquired while arrangements have been concluded to
provide sufficient tractor services to back up the cash crop
production efforts, according to ADP Project Manager Bamiro
Obamiro.
</P>
<P>
Assigned the sole production of cashew in exportable quality,
the FCT ADP has already taken the challenge by establishing 15
cashew farms in the nine development centers of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ADP has also introduced cotton, wheat and
cowpea to the farmers, Obamiro said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, non-cash crops will be made available to the
farmers with the seeds of about 5.5 tons of maize, 13 tons of
rice and six tons of soybeans to be distributed to farmers this
farming season.
</P>
<P>
The ADP is also involved in livestocks, fishery and piggery
production in commercial quantities.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany to Urge NATO's Admission of Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany are expected to
jointly propose to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
that it admits Romania as a member.
</P>
<P>
French officials attending the Franco-German summit today in
Poitiers, south-central France, said President Jacques Chirac and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl are "reflecting on" a joint proposal, which
also calls for the admission of another unnamed country, most
probably Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
The reflection came after a surprise announcement by the United
States that only Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic can enter
NATO in the first wave of NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Kohl discussed the issue of security and defense
soon after they began their meeting, with French Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin present.
</P>
<P>
United States Secretary of Defense William Cohen said in
Brussels Thursday that President Bill Clinton's primary concern
was to ensure a two-thirds majority in the U.S. Senate, which is
required to ratify any enlargement of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
He said the American position is "non-negotiable."
</P>
<P>
Germany has so far restrained from publicly expressing its view
on which countries should join NATO in the first wave. France has
supported the candidacy of Romania for a long time.

<HEADLINE> New Index for China-Affiliated Companies on HK's Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Hang Seng Index (HSI) Services
Limited announced here on Friday the launch of a new index, the
Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporations Index, on June 16 this
year, which is to track the performance of locally-listed
companies with a significant equity interest held by entities in
China.
</P>
<P>
The new index comprises 32 constituent stocks which have at
least 35 percent of their share holding held, directly or
indirectly, by state-owned organizations or provincial or
municipal authorities in China.
</P>
<P>
The stocks should have been listed for at least 12 months on
The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited and have a trading record
of at least 12 months under the control of the Chinese entities.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the stocks must not be constituent stocks of the
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which includes locally-listed
state-owned enterprises in China.
</P>
<P>
"There has been growing investors' interest in China-affiliated
companies listed on the Hong Kong stock market. This is reflected
by the increase in the market capitalization of the companies
covered by the Index from 2.7 percent at the end of May 1996 to
6.4 percent at the end of May 1997, and by the growth in their
turnover from 4.1 percent to 15.5 percent over the same period,"
said Anthony Wong, Chairman of HSI Limited.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is the seventh-largest stock market in the world and
the second-largest in Asia after Japan. Strategically located in
southern China, Hong Kong is the gateway for foreign companies to
expand into China's inland areas. With its sophisticated
financial infrastructure, Hong Kong has also become an important
fund-raising center for companies in China's inland," Wong said.
</P>
<P>
"The Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporations Index is designed
to meet the increasing demand for a benchmark to gauge the
performance of China-affiliated companies listed on the stock
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Each of the constituent stocks of the new index is weighted so
that it will influence the Index proportion to its respective
market value. The market value weightings will be updated on a
monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporations Index is backdated
to January 4, 1993 with a base value of 1,000. The Index stood at
2,490.20 at the close of business on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
From June 16, 1997, the Index will be released on a
minute-by-minute basis on each trading day. It will be widely
disseminated through international and local data services.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hurdler Barred from U.S. Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- World athletics governing body IAAF
said Friday that American hurdler Stephon Flenoy remains suspended
and is not authorized to run in the U.S. national championships.
</P>
<P>
The International Amateur Athletic Federation said it would
invoke its "contamination rule" in the Flenoy case, meaning that
any athlete who competes against him risks being suspended, a
report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The warning came one day after Flenoy, a 400-meter hurdler who
allegedly failed a drug test last year, was reinstated by an
American arbitrator in time to compete in the U.S. nationals in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
Flenoy had elevated levels of the hormone testosterone in a
urine sample taken at last year's U.S. Olympic trials. He was
suspended by USA Track and Field on April 4, and the IAAF
announced its own suspension on May 31.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minister Outlines Communications Cooperation With HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Wu Jichuan, Chinese minister of
Posts and Telecommunications, said here today that after the
return of Hong Kong, the central department in charge of
communications will continue to cooperate with its Hong Kong
counterparts and expand operations, by adhering to the principle
of equality and consultation.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Wu said the communications affairs
of Hong Kong will be administered by the government of the Hong
Kong Special Administration Region (SAR) itself after July 1.
</P>
<P>
The central department in charge of communications and its Hong
Kong counterparts will not be subordinate to each other, and no
posts and telecommunications departments in the inland areas may
interfere in affairs that the SAR shall administer on its own, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the staff in posts and telecommunications departments
at various levels are now carrying out numerous activities to
greet the return of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
To mark the historic event, the Chinese Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications started in 1995 to issue three sets of stamps
reflecting Hong Kong's scenery, economic development, and the
return, he added.
</P>
<P>
Entrusted by some relevant state departments, the ministry has
also shouldered the work of designing and printing the first set
of stamps for the Hong Kong SAR, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the exchanges and cooperations between the inland
areas and Hong Kong in the field of communications, Wu said both
sides have not only maintained close ties in the communications
network and business, but also been successful in communication
development, technical exchanges and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
He cited such cities as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Tianjin,
Haikou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Nanning and Shenzhen as having been
installed with a direct electric circuit linking Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In addition to traditional communications business, digital
mobile telephone roaming systems, and telephone cards have become
available between Hong Kong and the inland areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the status of Hong Kong as an international financial
and trade center is closely related to its status as an
international information center.
</P>
<P>
After the return of Hong Kong, communications departments of
both sides will increase cooperation and offer a better
communication service for the prosperity of the two sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
In referring to the Hong Kong investors involved in the
communications issue, Wu said his ministry will follow relevant
policies, encourage the Hong Kong businessmen to invest in some
specific projects with the prerequisite that they will not
participate in management, and give returns to the investors.
</P>
<P>
Given the unique situation of Hong Kong after its return, the
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will study how to further
absorb investment from the region, and offer preferential
treatment to Hong Kong investors, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Bans Use of CFCs in Aerosol Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China announced today that after
December 31, 1997, all aerosol product manufacturers should stop
using chloroflourocarbons (CFCs), substances that seriously damage
the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the country has banned an industry
from using substances harmful to the ozone.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference here today, nine central government
departments including the State Bureau of Environmental
Protection, the China National Council of Light Industry and the
Ministry of Chemical Industry, jointly issued the notice.
</P>
<P>
The notice said that the government will no longer register
aerosol products using CFCs after January 1, 1998, and no
factories that manufacturing such products will be approved to be
set up.
</P>
<P>
The factories that have already been established will be dealt
with according to the law, the notice added.
</P>
<P>
The ban also prohibits the planning and economic departments at
all levels from approving projects that deal with the aerosol
products that contain CFCs.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the bulk of the aerosol products used
currently in daily life such as mousse, cosmetics and pesticide
contain CFCs, damage the ozone layer upon entering the atmosphere,
which in turn allows more ultraviolet rays to reach the earth's
surface.
</P>
<P>
Experts here said that the increase in ultraviolet rays will
lead to higher incidence of cancer and cataracts, will lower
people's immunity to disease and adversely affect crop yields.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the country has decided to replace CFCs with
liquefied petroleum gas and dimethyl ether in the aerosol
industry, and to supervise the industry's products that formerly
used CFCs.
</P>
<P>
"Enterprises that violate the ban will be punished," officials
said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Holds Talks with Partner Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Defense ministers of the 16 NATO
states started today in Brussels an one-day meeting with their
counterparts from the alliance's 27 partner countries in the
framework of the newly established Euro-Atlantic Partnership
Council (EAPC).
</P>
<P>
The EAPC was formally launched two weeks ago in Sintra,
Portugal, at NATO's foreign ministers' meeting, with the aim of
promoting the political dialogue and military cooperation between
NATO and its partner countries.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at the meeting, NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana said that the new security body "has great promise,
offers new opportunities and carries with it new challenges".
</P>
<P>
He briefed the defense ministers from partners countries on the
outcome of NATO's defense ministers'' meeting on Thursday and the
development of the practical cooperation activities taken place in
the past year.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time for the ministers (from NATO and
partner countries) to discuss in depth the military cooperation in
the enhanced Partnership for Peace (PfP) Program," a NATO
official said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that from now on partner countries would be
actively involved in both planning and implementation of the PfP
activities "right from the beginning".
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Slovenian defense minister Turnsek Tit expressed
disappointment about Thursday's announcement by the United States
that it wanted only Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic to be in
NATO's first expansion, leaving outside Romania and Slovenia which
were strongly supported by a majority of NATO's European alllies,
including France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
"It is unlogical to exclude candidate countries which have
already met the accession criteria to joint in the first group,"
Tit was quoted by the same official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We hope NATO's open door will open again," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Prior to today's defense ministers' meeting, Solana has held a
short separate meeting with the first deputy defense minister of
Russia, Andrei Kokoshin.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, which is described by NATO officials as "a
good one", Kokoshin is said to have told Solana that Russian
President Boris Yeltsin was "enthusiastic" to see the early
implementation of "all the aspects" of the Russia-NATO Act, which
was signed by him and leaders of NATO states on May 27 in
Paris.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Leader Meets Russian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese people would like to
see a prosperous Russia where the people live happily, Li Ruihuan,
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) said here today during a
meeting with Chairman of the International Affairs Committee of
Russia's Federation Council Prusak Mikhail Mikhailovich.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia are each other's biggest neighbors, and the
Chinese people cherish special feelings towards the Russian
people, Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said the development and prosperity of China and Russia,
their good-neighborliness and mutually beneficial cooperation are
not only in the fundamental interests of the two countries and
their peoples, but are also significant to the peace and stability
of the Asia-Pacific and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, Li said, the exchange of high-level
visits between China and Russia have done much to improve the
overall development of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC and Russia's Federation Council have a good
relationship, and so do the special committees under them, Li
said. "We hope the two sides will intensify the cooperation and
increase the mutual understanding and friendship," he added.
</P>
<P>
Prusak said in the good discussions between his delegation and
the Chinese friends, both sides expressed the hope that Russia's
Federation Council and CPPCC, and also the two countries will work
to maintain and develop their friendship.
</P>
<P>
The International Affairs Committee of Russia's Federation
Council will do its best to reach this end, Prusak stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation arrived in Beijing Thursday on a
goodwill visit at the invitation of the Subcommittee of Foreign
Affairs of the CPPCC.

<HEADLINE> New Budget Ensures Social Justice, Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah
AMS Kibria said here today that the proposed budget for 1997-98
has been formulated with the aim to fulfill the election pledges
of the Awami (people's) League government by ensuring social
justice and poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
"We have translated slogans, given for a long time, into
realistic steps by making proposals in the proposed budget for
rural infrastructure and ensuring social justice," he told a
post-budget press conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Minister on Thursday night placed in Parliament the
budget for 1997-98 fiscal year, outlaying a total expenditure of
277.86 billion taka (about 6.46 billion U.S. dollars) and leaving
an overall deficit of 81.62 billion taka (about 1.9 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has turned
down the proposed new budget as "anti-people" and called upon the
people to build a movement against this budget.
</P>
<P>
The BNP alleged that this budget would lead mill, factories,
industries to destruction through encouraging smuggling from
neighboring India.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jatiya (national) Party Chairman HM Ershad, whose
party supported Awami (people's) League to form the government,
has also criticized the new budget and said the present government
will have to bear all its liabilities.
</P>
<P>
Defending his budget, the Finance Minister pointed out that
64.3 billion taka (about 1.49 billion dollars) has been earmarked
for direct and indirect expenditure in the social justice sector.
</P>
<P>
He said under the programme for providing allowance to the
elderly people, 4.5 million senior citizens would be benefited.
</P>
<P>
"This might be a small step but it is for the first time in
Bangladesh that such a measure for ensuring social security has
been proposed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Minister said the agriculture sector has been given
priority as two-thirds of the country's population are involved in
the sector directly or indirectly.
</P>
<P>
He said, to encourage investment in the agriculture sector, the
1997-98 budget has proposed and allocation of 10 billion taka
(about 232 million dollars) to be disbursed as agricultural loan
under the supervision of the Bangladesh Bank.
</P>
<P>
Besides, in order to generate employment, the budget has
proposed for setting up an "employment Bank" which would provide
assistance to youths for self-employment, he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of GDP (gross domestic product) in the 1997-98
fiscal is expected to be six percent and within the next five year
it would rise to seven percent, said the Finance Minister.

alliance's expansion to Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
-- Capitulating under political pressure, Congressional
Republicans passed a long-awaited 8.6 billion dollar disaster
relief bill yesterday, but not before the process revealed sharp

relations fiasco reminiscent of the Government shutdown 18 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton yesterday named a seven-member advisory
board that will organize town hall meetings, analyse date and
otherwise guide him as he prepares to launch a broad effort to
narrow America's racial divide.
</P>
<P>
-- Federal jurors in the Oklahoma City bombing case who 10 days

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today called on all qualified Filipinos to go out on Saturday and
register for the May 1998 national elections.
</P>
<P>
All Filipinos of voting age must register "as concerned
citizens of the country who are qualified voters" in their
respective registration centers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Commission on Elections has set two weekends -- June 14 and
15 and May 21 and 22 -- for the general registration of voters.
President Ramos also released 300 million pesos (11.4 million U.S.
dollars) for the registration.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said he and the first lady will register Saturday morning
in his hometown in Pangasinan province, the northern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the country's Supreme Court upheld its ban
on a charter change campaign, dimming hopes that President Ramos
could seek a second term by amending the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
According to the Constitution, Ramos should step down as his
term ends in June in 1998.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Annual Check-up of Extra-budgetary Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The check-up of extra-budgetary funds will start this month,
according to the notice, which was jointly issued by the Ministry
of Finance, the State Planning Commission, the State Auditing
Administration, the People's Bank of China and the Ministry of
Supervision.
</P>
<P>
Great success made in last year's effort to check up
extra-budgetary funds has effectively stopped a trend of illegally
setting up funds, increasing the number of fees and charges and
recklessly collecting and spending money, the notice said.
</P>
<P>
But problems connected with extra-budgetary funds have
accumulated over a long period of time, and some of them have not
been completely corrected, it noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are still areas that the previous review
failed to reach, the notice said.
</P>
<P>
This year's examination of extra-budgetary funds will focus
primarily on units in the police system, in industrial and
commercial administration and in the system for civil affair
administration, according to the notice.
</P>
<P>
In some places, the work to check up extra-budgetary funds has
already begun, it said, adding that the five government
departments will send special work teams to some areas or
departments to guide the check-up effort.

CANBERRA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed at
its highs for the day against the US dollar, after silence from
the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) this morning on interest

</P>
<P>
The local unit closed at 75.30 US cents, up from 75.18 at

<HEADLINE> Turkish Tourism Minister Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Tourism Minister Bahattin
Yucel resigned today before Welfare Party (RP) Chairman and
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's handover of his post to his
junior partner True Path Party (DYP) leader Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Yucel, a DYP deputy, said at a press conference in parliament
that "Any government model which will include the RP gives
signals that it will turn the growing tension in the country to a
clash."
</P>
<P>
He said that tension created by the RP escalated and new
efforts to find a solution with the participation of the Grand
Unity Party (BBP) will "drag the country along with a new crisis
instead of overcoming the problems."
</P>
<P>
Yucel became the fourth minister to quit the cabinet in less
than two months to pressure Ciller to end the alliance with
Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, also deputy prime minister and foreign minister, said
Thursday that Erbakan promised to leave his position and present
his resignation to President Suleyman Demirel on June 18, adding
that on the same day, she will ask the president to assign her
with the task of forming a new government.
</P>
<P>
This means that Ciller will take over power from Erbakan,
one year ahead of schedule set in a bi-partite agreement.
</P>
<P>
The RP and DYP formed the coalition government in 1996 and
signed the power-sharing protocol which stipulated that Erbakan
would head the government for the first two years and then turn
it over to Ciller for the remaining two years.
</P>
<P>
After near one year in power, the government is now faced
with growing impatience with Erbakan's inclination to inch the
country toward an Islamic entity and his reluctance to curb
the fundamentalist force in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The military and opposition regarded Erbakan's policies as a
threat to Turkey's secularism enshrined in its constitution.
</P>
<P>
Ciller and the DYP issued an ultimatum early this month to
Erbakan, asking him to hand out his post before June 18 or to
face a collapse of the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan and Ciller met with BBP leader Muhsin Yaziciouglu, a
prospective new coalition partner, for several hours Thursday to
seek a way out of the current political crisis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the three party leaders came amid an
increasing political tension due to another military warning
against the rapidly expanding fundamentalist activities in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Forum Calls for More Western Aid for Africa (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The second Asia-Africa Forum today
urged the international community, Western developed countries in
particular, to continue its help in Africa's economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
The call is contained in "the message to the Denver Summit of
the Eight" (countries), which was adopted here today before the
forum concluded its three-day meetings.
</P>
<P>
The forum "expressed the hope that the summit will make
significant contributions in support of African development
efforts," the message said.
</P>
<P>
The forum also "urged the participating countries of the Denver
summit to reinforce their support to inter-regional and triangular
cooperation aimed at furthering African development."
</P>
<P>
The forum today also adopted "the Bangkok Statement for
Furthering Asia-Africa Cooperation," which urged African countries
to "intensify the pace of structural transformation of their
economies in order to enhance mutually beneficial relationships
with Asian countries."
</P>
<P>
It noted that trade and investment between Asia and Africa,
though relatively low, have been rising steadily in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The forum emphasized the crucial role of the private sector and
observed that successful economies in Asia and Africa have
implemented policies and strategies conducive to private sector
development.
</P>
<P>
The forum recognized that there were numerous opportunities for
public and private sector cooperation -- the development of
infrastructure, communications, deepening of the financial sector,
managerial and vocational skills training and the promotion of
foreign investment and development of joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The three-day forum focused on Africa's capacity building
including institutional, political and economic aspects,
sustainable agricultural development and food security and private
sector development.
</P>
<P>
It said agriculture is one of the areas where Asia's experience
and success can be put to use in Africa and that more needs to be
done to expand networks among agricultural institutions and the
private sector of the two continents.

<HEADLINE> Sweden Helps Zambia Boost Rural Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's rural enterprises will
benefit from a seven-billion-Kwacha economic expansion in
outlying areas (EEOA) project sponsored by the Swedish
International Development Agency (SIDA).
</P>
<P>
The 5.38-million-U.S.-Dollar project aims at improving the
rural dwellers' economic base by creating infrastructure and
fostering a sense of ownership among the stakeholders, according
to a project brief.
</P>
<P>
The EEOA is already in operation in Northern and Eastern
provinces.
</P>
<P>
However, this is not a handout type of project as partakers
will have to contribute 20 percent of the total cost for a
individual project either in case or in kind.
</P>
<P>
One of the components of the EEOA is the credit guarantee fund
aimed at helping rural entrepreneurs access to capital from
commercial financial institutions as well as assist new viable
projects in target areas.
</P>
<P>
Because of past experience in loan recovery, the risk factor
of lending will be shared between the bank and the EEOA project
to guarantee that all efforts will be made to recover the loans.
</P>
<P>
In this case, the credit guarantee fund will only consider
medium and small scale entrepreneurs with a proven record of
sound financial management. The bank will also only consider
applications for viable projects.
</P>
<P>
The EEOA program will provide management training for
successful applicants as they may require.

At the forum, Chinese representative Li Guoqing, who is deputy

Cooperation, said that during the last four decades, China has
provided various kinds of official assistance to Africa. The most
significant one was the 1,860-km-long Tanzania-Zambia Railway.
</P>
<P>
China's assistance to African countries covers a wide range of
sectors, including agriculture, animal husbandry, fishery, textile
industry, energy, road and transportation, broadcast and
telecommunications, irrigation and electric power,
machine-building, public and civil works, public health and
education, handcraft as well as food processing, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The forum was attended by senior officials from 44 African
countries, 11 Asian countries, 12 donor countries and 10
international organizations.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A foreign private
telecommunications company, Telecel, will start operation late
this month in Zambia, "Times of Zambia" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Telecel Commercial Director Clive Shamwana said here on

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Cheng was punished for petty theft
when he was 15. Now he is studying at a key university in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Without Aunt Shang's help, it would be impossible for me to
have this opportunity," Cheng said with his voice quivering.
</P>
<P>
"Aunt Shang" is Shang Xiuyun, a judge dealing with juvenile
delinquents at Beijing's Haidian District People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Shang, 54, is one of China's first generation of judges devoted
to juvenile cases. In the past decade she has seen many sorry
scenes in her court, and has enthusiastically directed a large
number of youngsters back on a meaningful path in life.
</P>
<P>
Twelve youngsters Shang has dealt with have been accepted as
students by some of the best universities including Beijing and
Qinghua universities, while a further 18 have studied at key
vocational schools and secondary schools. Moreover, 99 percent of
the delinquents whose cases have been dealt with by Shang have
firmly broken away from their criminal pasts.
</P>
<P>
The new lives of the 170-plus youngsters are closely connected
to Shang's determination and dedication to offer them help.
</P>
<P>
Haidian District has the greatest concentration of schools in
Beijing. The number of secondary schools there alone exceeds 120.
</P>
<P>
An official said that the District People's Court handles about
one-third of the city's juvenile cases every year.
</P>
<P>
"To punish isn't a judge's aim," Shang says.
</P>
<P>
"I should help these youngsters," Shang told herself on the
first day that she handled juvenile cases 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Some of them were up in court for stealing a designer T-shirt,
others a book, while a few stole bikes, maybe to sell and raise
cash for a birthday party or present.
</P>
<P>
One reason they committed these petty crimes was that they were
never given the necessary attention, care, help and education from
their family and society, she said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Urged to Draw Up New Aviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has been
urged to formulate a new aviation policy to bring maximum
benefits to Zambia, according to "Zambia Daily Mail".
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper today quoted a civil aviation official as
saying here on Thursday that the government has at many times
pronounced a liberalized policy in air transport but without
legal framework for implementing it.
</P>
<P>
Sam Namukombo, AERO Zambia special assistant to the managing
director, said that Zambia has yet to formulate a comprehensive
long term aviation policy, which could be monitored and managed
by a national civil aviation board.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's registered airlines' role in the socio-economic
development is unspecified and therefore the government should
take into account the rapid changes taking place in a number of
countries to take measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said civil aviation in Zambia is still guided by two
outdated laws and this scenario is now giving problems to other
foreign airlines operating air services to and from Lusaka
International Airport in respect of the provision of ground
handling services, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
On one occasion Shang invited a defendant's mother to the court
room in order to make an emotional impression on the accused.
</P>
<P>
Once she had formally pronounced the court's decision, she
shouted with emotion, "Lad, just look at your mother... look at
her... It's clear that she works her hands to the bone to care for
you!"
</P>
<P>
Ashamed, the pathetic lad knelt down at the feet of his mother
as tears rolled down his cheeks. "Mother, I'll improve. I'll..."
</P>
<P>
At that moment, many in the court room were overcome with this
emotional scene.
</P>
<P>
To keep track of the youngsters after they exit the courts,
Shang holds files on each of them. She calls them on the phone and
sometimes meets them. It's time consuming, but worth it, she said.
</P>
<P>
To a certain extent this dedicated, motherly judge has become a
real aunt. Shang has all the childrens' birthdays noted down, and
phones them to give her best wishes on their big days, always
encouraging them to make further, honest progress.
</P>
<P>
"The kids seem willing to tell Shang what's on their minds, and
many actually call her Aunt," the judge's assistant Lu Haifei said.
</P>
<P>
Shang is also mother to two of her own children. But sometimes
they feel neglected.
</P>
<P>
"I'll never forget my daughter's angry words to me one
night. She roared at me, 'other children can have meals with their
father and mother at night, but not me. You often forget my
birthday, but always remember theirs'. Who is your child?" Shang
recalled her daughter as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, delinquents do need more love and care," Shang said.
</P>
<P>
In an educational show room attached to the court, there is a
sculpture, appropriately and simply named "Hand". It was given to
Shang by one juvenile offender.
</P>
<P>
It symbolizes the countless, helping hands she has held out.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Parliamentarians Ask Military to Step </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Parliamentarians in Sierra Leone on
Thursday released a mediation plan calling on the ruling junta to
step down, according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), set up in the
wake of the May 25 coup that overthrew the civilian government,
is reported to hold a meeting today to consider the calls.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, other proposals by the four-member
cross-party mediation team include the "formation of the
broad-based government of national unity including all political
parties represented in parliament, the (rebel) Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) and other interest groups".
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the team called for the release of Foday
Sankoh, leader of the RUF, from alleged detention in Nigeria "to
enable him to participate in the further political arrangements
of the country".
</P>
<P>
The AFRC has appointed Sankoh as its vice-chairman and
repeatedly called on Nigeria to release him.
</P>
<P>
The document issued by the team, entitled "Proposals for
Parliamentary Mediation in the Current Constitutional Crisis and
Political Stalemate in the Country", also calls for "the
guaranteed future of all officers and men involved in the
military takeover".
</P>
<P>
As for the army's bitter rivals in civil defense units, these
should be disarmed and demobilized, while all RUF fighters should
be encamped, according to the proposals.
</P>
<P>
"United Nations and ECOMOG peacekeeping force should be
stationed throughout Sierra Leone to strengthen security in the
country," the plan suggested.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, government and private sector
employees in capital Freetown continued to refuse to go back to
work, while schools, colleges, hospitals, banks and other
commercial houses remained closed.
</P>
<P>
This is "a vivid manifestation of opposition to the military
takeover," the report said, quoting Ibrahim Sorrie, secretary of
the mediation team.
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of a breakout of civil conflict among various
factions of the community continues to increase," he added.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Human Development Index Ranking Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's ranking in the human
development index has fallen to 134 out of 175 nations this year
from 128 out of 174 countries in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 Human Development Report compiled by the United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) said that Kenya ranked 113 in
1991 in the world.
</P>
<P>
The report released by UNDP Deputy Resident Representative
Nancy Assanga on Thursday attributed Kenya's downward spiral to
the social and economic adjustment programs introduced in the
1980s, which have impoverished many people.
</P>
<P>
Cost-sharing in education and health and the liberalization
of the economy carried out by the Kenyan government had also had
adverse effects on the human development index, said John
Githongo at a reception who assisted in analyzing the data.
</P>
<P>
Recent drought and political changes have also impacted
negatively on the country's socio-economic developments, he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, about 42 percent of the people in
Sub-Saharan Africa and 40 percent of that in South Asia live
below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, the report said, poverty is increasing in
Sub-Saharan Africa in proportion and in absolute numbers.
</P>
<P>
The HIV/Aids scourge is taking an immense toll on many
nations, leading to a reduction in life expectancy in the region,
and conflicts have also led to the decline in life expectancy in
countries like Rwanda and the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The human development index indicates how far a country has
gone to attain certain defined goals, including an average life
expectancy, universal access to education and decent living
standards.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan, China to Further Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev told Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian today that
Kazakhstan is confident that relations with China will be further
developed.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev said there is not any obstacle in the development of
relations between the two countries, adding that their relations
have developed comprehensively and smoothly since the two
countries established diplomatic ties in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The frequent exchange of high-level visits between the two
countries has set up a solid foundation for the long-term
bilateral relationship, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev said the Kazakhstan-China borders are peaceful since
the four CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) nations,
including Kazakhstan, and China signed an agreement on
strengthening mutual trust in the military field on the borders
last year as well as an accord on arms reduction on the borders
this year.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Kazakhstan has been always supporting the
territorial integrity and unity of China and opposing any
activities harmful to Chinese sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He praised China's defense policy which insists on non-military
alliance and is devoted to strengthening its own defense, saying
that Kazakhstan would improve military cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
The kazakh president said, "the return of Hong Kong to China on
July 1 is an event of great historic significance. We will share
the joy with the Chinese people," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the convening of the 15th National Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party this autumn, he said he wished the Chinese people
greater achievements in their modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who arrived here Wednesday at the head of a military
delegation on a six-day visit, said he hoped that his visit would
help strengthen cooperation between the two countries in all fields.
</P>
<P>
He said China adopts a peaceful, independent foreign policy and
will never seek military alliance, external expansion or
establishment of military bases on any other countries.
</P>
<P>
he said the friendly cooperation between China and Kazakhstan
would be in line with the interests of the two peoples and
conducive to peace and stability in the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
Chi also held talks today with Kazakh Prime Minister Akezhan
Kazhegeletin on economic ties between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Urges U.S. to Refund F-16 Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan today urged the United
States to find an amicable way out of the impasse regarding the
refund of 628 million U.S. dollars which it paid for 28 F-16
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan urges the U.S. Administration to find a solution to
the issue now that the option of refund from the F-16 aircraft
sale to Indonesia has fallen through, a Foreign Office spokesman
told a news briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan, during his visit to
the U.S., took up the issue with State Department and other
officials, emphasizing that American must deliver the aircraft or
refund the money, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"But the U.S. Administration says that a legislation prohibits
them from the sale," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has contacted lawyers to consider the legal option
before the statute of limitation expires in 1999, he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also expressed serious concern over the reported
deployment of the Prithvi missiles by India near Pakistan's
border.
</P>
<P>
"The deployment of Prithvi missiles across our borders entails
a qualitative change in the security environment in South Asia,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that our region can ill-afford a missile race," he
said. "At the same time, we have to address our legitimate
security concerns and will take all necessary measures to meet any
threat."
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has addressed letters to the
leaders of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, drawing their attention to the serious degradation in the
security environment of our region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"He (Sharif) has reminded them of their special responsibility
for the preservation of international peace and security and urged
them to call upon India to excise restraint," the spokesman said.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The Swedish Electrolux company, a world leading producer of
household appliances such as vacuum cleaners and ovens, Thursday
announced a plan to close 25 factories and 50 warehouses in two
years, which would result in the lay-off of 12,000 employees in
the 60 countries where the company is established. The plan came
after the company earned a 591 million franc (102 million
U.S. dollar) profit in the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
-- France and Germany will hold a summit today in Poitiers,
France, the first one since the Socialist government led by Lionel
Jospin came to power. Observers said Germany and France are eager
to solve their difference over the Stability Pact for European
single currency, the size of the European institutions and the
role of the European parliament, in order to avoid a crisis in the
process of European integration.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
will speak in a single voice at the Franco-German summit today in
Poitiers as well as the EU Amsterdam summit scheduled for next

not attend the summit of the G-7 summit to be held next week in
Denver, the United States, because his presence was not
"indispensable."
</P>
<P>
-- France has ruled out the possibility of intervening in the
on-going conflict in the Congo Republic. Former Congolese President
Denis Sassou-N'Guesso, head of one side of the conflict, has
proposed deployment of an international peace-keeping force in
Brazzaville, while President Pascal Lissouba said that his
priority was to arrange the presidential election on July 27.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The South Afrian power
utility Eskom is studying the possibility of using the country's
numerous disused mineshafts to generate electricity with falling
water, the local daily the Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
The theory is that the water, which occurs naturally at the
bottom of the mines, would be pumped to the surface then released
back down the shaft to drive a turbine generator, the report
quoted Eskom spokesman Peter Adams as saying.
</P>
<P>
The proposal held great promise becuase it could provide a
clean sources of energy, a Eskom sources said.
</P>
<P>
Dave Blake, one of the scientists working on the project, said the
research was at an early stage.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 meeting of the
International Valuation Standards Committee (IVSC) will be held in
China.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be sponsored by the China Appraisal Society
(CAS), which joined the IVSC in 1995, according to an announcement
which was made public Thursday on the last day of a three-day
symposium on international appraisal standards.
</P>
<P>
IVSC, a London-headquartered self-discipline organization in
the asset evaluation industry, was founded in 1981. It now has 45
member countries.
</P>
<P>
Pan Yue, deputy director-general of China's State
Administration of State Property, said that asset evaluation has
developed rapidly in China in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that there were 3,343 approved asset
appraisal agencies and more than 55,000 professional valuers in
China at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
More than 44,300 asset evaluations were carried out in China in
1996, with the book value of assets and appraised values reaching
569.4 billion yuan and 770 billion yuan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
IVSC Chairman Philippe Malaquin highly commended CAS,
describing it as an important organization for setting asset
evaluation standards in China.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, jointly organized by CAS, the United Nations
Development Program and China International Economic and Technical
Exchange Center of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
cooperation, attracted industry officials and experts from China,
the United States, France, Australia, Denmark, Hong Kong and other
countries and regions.

</P>
<P>
Chand also said that the Nepalese people are glad to see Hong
Kong's return to China on July 1.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rawlings Sceptical About Coupists' Ability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings
has rebuffed an eight-man diplomatic mission from Sierra Leone's
military leader Major Johnny Koroma to discuss possible ways of
averting military action against the junta.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, Rawlings on
Thursday expressed doubts over the ability of the junta to
convince anybody with its diplomatic shuttles.
</P>
<P>
He told the delegation "in clear terms" to abdicate power and
restore the civilian government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
ousted in the coup on May 25.
</P>
<P>
According to him, this was the only honorable path open to the
military leaders to avoid any military assault from the west
African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a four-hour parley with the delegation led by
former Sierra Leonean Ambassador to Germany Dauda Kamara,
Rawlings also blamed Sierra Leone's military leaders for
Tuesday's heavy exchange of gunfire between ECOMOG and
supporters of the junta.
</P>
<P>
The clash around Lungi International Airport near the capital
Freetown, according to the military regime, took place when some
of the soldiers that were dispatched to Lungi used a wrong road.
</P>
<P>
Castigating the military regime for fraternizing with the rebel
Revolutionary United Front (RUF), Rawlings was quoted as asking
the delegation "what does your government stand to gain from
associating with that kind of force that was held in low esteem
by all?"
</P>
<P>
"From all indications, your friendship with RUF is a
reflection of weakness on the part of your government," he said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation reportedly wore long faces as they departed the
venue of the meeting with Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Koroma had asked Ghana not to join any international
force that might want to take military action against the junta.
He also sought the assistance of Rawlings to persuade other
African countries not to invade Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Koroma was reported to have warned that any international
invasion would create "serious difficulties", while pleading that
the rebels be given a chance to prove their commitment to peace
and democracy.
</P>
<P>
The RUF had been fighting a civil war in Sierra Leone since
1991 and a ceasefire was reached only in November last year when
an agreement was signed between it and Kabbah's government.
</P>
<P>
It allied to the military regime after the May 25 coup with
its former leader Foday Sankoh appointed vice-chairman of the
ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary Council.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Foreign Trade Sees Favorable Balance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia had a favorable trade
balance of 28.3 million U.S. dollars in the first five months this
year, reversing a 6.8 million dollar trade deficit in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics issued by the Mongolian National Statistics Bureau
show that Mongolia's foreign trade in the first five months
totalled 280.9 million dollars, of which 154.6 million were
exports and 126.3 million were imports.
</P>
<P>
The favorable trade balance resulted in a rise in the nation's
foreign exchange reserve which registered 52 million dollars this
June, a 2 million dollar increase from the registered 50 million
dollars at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia has developed its trade relations with China, Japan,
the United States, Switzerland, South Korea and Italy since the
beginning of the 1990's.
</P>
<P>
Of its total exports, 44.1 percent went to Switzerland, 21
percent to China and 8.6 percent to Russia. Of its total imports,
32.4 percent was from Russia, 13.8 percent from Italy and 10.1
from China.
</P>
<P>
Copper takes more than half of Mongolia's total export
volume. It imports crude oil from Russia and food and daily
necessities mainly from China.

JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Illovo Sugar, South Africa's
major sugar producer, has announced that it will be listed on the
Swaziland Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came shortly after Illovo acquired the

has plans to diversify its product range by concentrating on
sugar-based byproducts.
</P>
<P>
The local daily "Business Day" quoted Illovo sources as saying
that the listing and consolidation with Swaziland's counterpart
will give additional impetus to Illovo's development.
</P>
<P>
"As a regional player, Illovo operates in 15 sugar mills
throughout Africa," Swaziland government spokesman Meshack
Shongwe said.
</P>
<P>
Illovo's industry position is expected to sweeten the sour
relations between the Swaziland Sugar Association and the South

LONDON, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Tory leadership contenders have agreed to face a
cross-examination by the entire parilamentary party on the
eve of Tuesday's second round ballot.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England,
promised Thursday that the central bank would not use its
newly granted independence to depress the economy
unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The British government is seeking to postpone up to
two years the implementation of laws on workers' rights
contained in the European Union's social chapter. The demand
for a lengthy transitional period for British firms is a
further sign of Prime Minister Tony Blair's determination
not to allow the social chapter to be used to impose
burdensome new rules and regulations on business.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Tony Blair will use his first +meet the
people+ law and order question time today to announce plans
to protect witnesses who fear intimidation or reprisals if
they report crime to the police or give evidence in court.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham said Thursday
it was +disappointing+ that Britain's proposals for
ending the worldwide ban on British beef exprots had been
dismissed as +inadequate+ by veterinary experts meeting in
Brussels.

<HEADLINE> Pupil Enrollment Down in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The annual gross enrollment in
Kenya's primary schools fell by two percent to 55 percent this
year mainly due to the introduction of cost-sharing in schools,
which has locked out children from poor background.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 23 percent of the pupils enrolled in the country's
16,000 primary schools dropped out before reaching grade five
between 1990 and 1995, according to a lastest Human Development
Report.
</P>
<P>
The decline was also a result of lack of adequate teaching
facilities and qualified teachers in many schools in the eastern
African country, the local press quoted the report as saying
today.
</P>
<P>
The requirement that children must go to school in uniform,
buy a variety of textbooks and pay numerous levies and fees have
also contributed to the drop in school enrollment, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya's adult illiteracy rate was sharply down to
21.9 percent in 1995 from about 35 percent in previous years,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kenyan Education Director Sammy Kyungu said the
government has drafted guidelines to liberalize the education
sector in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines, procurement of textbooks, supply and
distribution would be school-based rather than dependent on the
Kenya Institute of Education, he said on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Shelterbelts Will Help Boost Grain Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- More than 2.4 million hectares of
farmland shelter-forests have been planted in the three northern
areas of China -- the northeast, north and northwest --
benefiting 21.5 million hectares of farmland, the China Forestry
News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Shelter provided by the belts could help boost grain production
in the north by 10 million tons a year, or 10 to 30 percent,
the paper estimated.
</P>
<P>
The planting of farmland shelter-forests is an important part
of China's "Three Northern Shelterbelt Project", the world's most
ambitious project to combat desertification and soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
So far 65 percent of northern farmland has been well protected
by the mass planting of trees, the paper said, adding that initial
shelterbelt systems have been established in more than 50 counties
or banners (administrative county-level regions in Inner Mongolia)
in the region.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Surpasses Japan in Shipbuilding Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korean shipbuilding industry
outperformed its Japanese rivals in the orders received so far
this year, but underperformed in terms of value, industry sources
said today.
</P>
<P>
The orders received by South Korean shipbuilders during the
first five months reached 3.59 million tons for 58 ships, about
150,000 tons more than Japan's 3.44 million tons for 136 ships.
</P>
<P>
However, the value of the five-month orders stood at 2,722
million U.S. dollars, about 85 percent of the 3,203 million
dollars registered by Japanese shipbuilders.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that South Korean shipbuilders have obtained
orders at low prices regardless of the type of ships, while
Japanese shipbuilders selected the orders with high added values.
</P>
<P>
"South Korean shipbuilders replaced the Japanese ones to lead
in shipbuilding orders, but their management difficulties are
expected to persist due to expansion of facilities and low ship
prices," a business source said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea used to emerge as a world leader in shipbuilding
orders in 1993 with 8.32-million-ton orders, compared with Japan's
7.53 million tons.

<P>
SHANTOU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a ground station
for two international marine cables is expected to be launched
shortly in Shantou, a port city of south China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the construction will be completed
by the end of this year, and the ground station will go into
operation in early next year.
</P>
<P>
The ground station is one of the two ground stations scheduled
to be built in China for the Eurasian International Marine Cable
and Sino-American International Cable. The other ground station
will be built in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The investment for the two optical cables, the largest of their
kind in the world, will reach a total of some 2.5 billion
U.S. dollars. When completed, the two cable systems will be able
to transmit simultaneously 1.2 million digital lines and will
become an international information highway as the cables traverse
a vast number of countries and are the world's best equipped
marine systems.
</P>
<P>
China will bear more than 40 million U.S. dollars of the
investment required to lay the marine cables. The ground station
in Shantou will cover an area of more than 2.67 hectares, with a
construction space of 40 million sq m. Its total investment is
expected to reach some 100 million yuan (12 million US Dollars).

ISLAMABAD, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has proposed to host an
intra-Afghan meeting in Islamabad under the U.N. auspices, a
Foreign Office spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Apart from all the Afghan warring factions, the meeting will
also be attended by countries sharing land border with Afghanistan
as well as Russia and the United States, the spokesman told a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"It is our conviction that a solution to the Afghan problem has
to emerge from the Afghans themselves," he said. "The Afghans
would not accept any solution imposed on them from outside."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan is sounding out the Afghan groups and is in touch
with the neighboring counties about the proposed meeting," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Decisions made at the intra-Afghan meeting could be guaranteed
by the U.S. and Russia to provide funds for the reconstruction of
Afghanistan as an incentive for the Afghan leaders to implement
the decisions which themselves have reached, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that such an intra-Afghan dialogue will provide
a useful forum for the Afghan leaders to achieve national
reconciliation for the establishment of a government in which all
ethnic groups are represented," the spokesman said.

<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Advancing the long-term and stable
friendship and relations of cooperation between China and
Australia and their armed forces not only accords with the basic

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The German government will provide
12 million marks in aid to southwest China's Sichuan Province for
a forest project on the upper reaches of the Jialing River.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with an agreement signed by the German government
and the Sichuan provincial government, the money, the largest
amount received by the local forestry departments, will be used
primarily to improve the ecological environment in Guangyuan City,
located on the upper reaches of the Jialing River,
</P>
<P>
With a low forest coverage, the city has suffered from soil
erosion for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The Jialing River, 1,120 km long and with 160,000 sq km of a
basin area, is the most important tributary of the Yangtze River
on the River's upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
According to the Provincial Department of Forestry, over the
next five years, trees will be planted on 32,000 hectare of
mountainous sides in Guangyuan with the funds from the German

<HEADLINE> South Korean Overseas Investment to Be Liberalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 13 (Xinhua) -- South Korean companies will be free
to invest overseas as from August 1, a deregulation package
unveiled by the ministry of finance and economy said today.
</P>
<P>
Under the package, South Korean firms can invest abroad freely,
without regard to the amount of investment, by merely reporting to
their main creditor banks.
</P>
<P>
"The package is aimed at simplifying procedures for outward
direct investment and relieving the financial burden of
corporations when investing abroad," ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
Under the current regulations, companies must report to the
Central Bank of Korea if the amount of investment exceeds 10
million U.S. dollars, and if the investment abroad amounts to 50
million dollars companies must first get approval from the
government screening committee.
</P>
<P>
Despite the loosened rules, in case of projects valued at more
than 50 million dollars, companies exposed to heavy debts will
have to undergo deliberation by the screening committee, said the
officials.
</P>
<P>
As from August 1, South Korean companies will also be free from
the obligation system under which companies must raise their own
capital as part of the overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The ministry officials said since the current overseas direct
investment has shown signs of waning, "there is no need to keep
the system intact," which has been in operation since 1995 to
regulate the rush of South Korea's outward investment.
</P>
<P>
Growth in South Korea's investment abroad amounted to 6.1
billion dollars last year on an approval basis, but the
year-to-year growth dropped to 25 percent from the 90 percent in
1994 and 37 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In return for giving full freedom to corporations in outward
investment, the ministry plans to strengthen rules on corporate
public notices on the South Korea Stock Exchange with regard to
overseas investment.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Calls for Wider Debts Write-Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki on Thursday called for an international
debt forgiveness program to be extended to more poor nations in
the world, the ocal daily the Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki made the plea in Cape Town at the launching of a
United Nations Development Program report on poverty, urging the
world's industrialized nations to practice debt-forgiveness when
dealing with Africa.
</P>
<P>
"There has to be debt forgiveness. Some of the steps that have
been taken with regard to some of the least developed countries,
where there has been this debt forgiveness, needs to be extended
to a larger number of countries," said Mbeki, adding debt-relief
is critical for African development.
</P>
<P>
The debt forgiveness program, launched last year by the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Paris Club of
creditor nations, is aimed to write off up to 80 percent debts
for about 25 of the world's poorest countries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has been identified as the first country to benefit,
and will have about 20 percent of its 3.5 billion US Dollars debt
forgiven in April next year.
</P>
<P>
Other probable candidates in Africa include Cote d'Ivoire,
Burkina Faso, Benin, Mali, Mozambique and Togo.
</P>
<P>
Africa has a total international debt of 340 billion US
Dollars which costs 24 billion US Dollars a year to service.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Huaihua Prefecture in central
China's Hunan Province has increased economic and technological
cooperation with other areas in a bid to shake off poverty.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture, one of the nine major poverty-stricken areas in
the country, launched 186 projects involving total investment of
304 million yuan (about 36.6 million US dollars) last year in
cooperation with other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 1996, total output value of township
enterprises in the prefecture topped 10 billion yuan, an increase
of 73 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture, inhabited by a group of minority ethnic groups,
has been underdeveloped for years. In recent years, China has
shifted its economic development to central and western regions,
providing opportunities for Huaihua.
</P>
<P>
The prefectural government has sent a dozen group of officials
to coastal areas in southeast China to draw on management
expertise.
</P>
<P>
Twelve counties and cities in the prefecture all have
established cooperation relations with prosperous counties or
cities in coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
Through economic and technological cooperation, 23 state-owned
enterprises in Zhijiang and Jingzhou counties in the prefecture
have stepped out of financial difficulties, providing jobs for
more than 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The Jingjiang County Timber Mill, which was on the verge of
bankruptcy, has been revived by introducing five million yuan from
Hainan and Anhui provinces. The mill is capable of generating an
annual output value of 30 million yuan and earn 20,000 yuan in
profits.

<HEADLINE> More Work Needed to End Stalemate: Egyptian Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian mediator Osama al-Baz
failed to persuade Israeli and Palestinian officials to return
to the negotiating table in the latest round of mediation drive
between the two sides, reported the state-run Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with both Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat Thursday, al-Baz, Egyptian presidential adviser,
told reporters that more work is needed to terminate the deadlock
in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks that have broken off since
Israel began construction of a new settlement at Har Homa in East
Jerusalem in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
Al-Baz's meetings were to have been followed by a second
round of talks between the two negotiating teams, led by Israeli
cabinet secretary Danny Naveh and Palestinian chief negotiator
Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
During their one-hour meeting in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu and
al-Baz tried to bridge the gap between Israel and the PNA over
the Har Homa construction.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has been demanding a six-month settlement
freeze in the West Bank including East Jerusalem as a
prerequisite for convening final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Al-Baz then proceeded to Ramallah, West Bank, for a two-hour
session with Arafat and other Palestinian officials. Palestinian
sources said that the gaps between the two sides apparently
remained as wide as ever.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian envoy, who left for home immediately afterwards,

<HEADLINE> Five Men Run under 10 Seconds at U.S. Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Five American sprinters, led by
Jon Drummond, ran stunningly-fast 100-meter times in preliminary
rounds at the U.S. championships in Indianapolis Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Drummond clocked 9.92 seconds and four others run under 10
seconds in first-round races. While Marion Jones produced the
year's fastest two women's 100-meter times, dominating the
semifinals in 10.92 seconds after running 10.98 seconds in her
opening race, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Only seven men have ever run faster than Drummond, a 1996
Olympian, and no one has been faster in a non-final.
</P>
<P>
Headwinds slowed the parade of speedsters in the men's
semifinals, where three-time Olympian Dennis Mitchell was
eliminated after placing sixth in his race.
</P>
<P>
The top three finishers in the finals earn a place on the
U.S. team for the Athens world championships in August.
</P>
<P>
The shot put final was almost as impressive as the 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
World record-holder Randy Barnes decided the competition with a
put of 22.03 meters, the best in 1997. Second went to Kevin Toth
with a lifetime best of 21.78 meters and Olympian C.J. Hunter --
Marion Jones's boyfriend -- claimed third at 21.34 meters.
</P>
<P>
World champion John Godina missed a chance to defend his title,
placing fourth at 20.49 meters.
</P>
<P>
Steve Fritz, fourth in the Atlanta Olympics, won the decathlon
with 8,604 points, the second-best mark of the year, while
Olympian Kelly Blair was first in the heptathlon with a lifetime
best of 6,465 points.
</P>
<P>
The American men had not been among the year's top-five
100-meter runners until Thursday. Maurice Greene changed that with
a 9.96-second clocking in the opening heat. Only Trinidad's Ato
Boldon, at 9.89 seconds, had run faster.
</P>
<P>
Drummond came even closer to Boldon's mark with his 9.92 in the
third heat. Kareem Streete-Thompson was second at 9.96 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Also under 10 seconds were Mike Marsh, winner of the fourth
heat at 9.97 seconds, and Tim Montgomery, the fifth-heat winner at
9.96 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The wind shifted into the runners' faces before the men's
semifinals and times slowed.
</P>
<P>
Marsh ran 10.13 seconds and Drummond clocked 10.18 seconds to
pace one semifinal. Greene led the second in 10.08.

<HEADLINE> SADC to Speak with One Voice at CITES Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Africa Development
Community (SADC) has agreed to speak with one voice at the
ongoing 10th meeting of the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species (CITES) to increase winning chances of their
various proposals.
</P>
<P>
Zambia and Tanzania, which were once said to be against the
region's stance of taking a common approach at the meeting,
cleared the misconceptions at a press briefing yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries announced that they will support their
fellow SADC member countries in their proposals.
</P>
<P>
The briefing, which was attended by representatives of 12 SADC
delegations, was chaired by South African high commissioner to
Zimbabwe Kingsley Mamabolo.
</P>
<P>
Director of National Parks and Wildlife Services of Zambia
Ackim Mwenya said although his country was not proposing to
downlist the African elephant, "she endorses the proposal by the
three proponent countries".
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Botswana and Namibia are proposing the downlisting
of the African elephant from Appendix I to Appendix II, which
allows restricted commercial trade in the animal's products.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the Tanzanian delegation said her country
supported the three countries, since the states had provided
enough scientific data to show reasons why they wanted their
elephants downlisted.
</P>
<P>
The SADC is also advocating for a secret ballot, if ever a
vote was to be conducted at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, some delegates, mainly from the west, appeared not to
listen to the problems being faced by the countries of the
region.

<HEADLINE> China to Reform Trade Practices in WTO Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China, which initiated the
opening-up policy 20 years ago, has promised to further liberalize
its trade practices.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (Moftec) reaffirmed China's commitment to reduce its
general tariff level from the current 23 to 15 percent, an average
for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zixian in charge of policy research at Moftec made the
statement during an investment policy forum here last week.
</P>
<P>
His remarks, coinciding with China's accelerated talks on entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO), indicated that the market
economy is still on track despite the death of Deng Xiaoping who
had transformed the country's decades-old central planned economic
system.
</P>
<P>
Although Wang, like other Chinese officials, defined China's
market economy as being socialist in nature, he was quick to say
"prevailing international economic practice is to be pursued."
</P>
<P>
Within three years of China's accession to WTO, foreign
businesses will be allowed to deal in international trade through
an automatic registration system, he explained.
</P>
<P>
The WTO has agreed that China can join as a developing member
which can remove such trade barriers as tariff and non-tariff
control gradually.
</P>
<P>
But a clear time-table for China to gain WTO membership still
has not been announced.
</P>
<P>
International companies, especially those in the Asia-Pacific
region, have demanded an early deal be made so as to promote their
profits in China.
</P>
<P>
Moftec Vice-Minister Long Yongtu has said China's 10-year long
strenuous process of applying to integrate with the world free
trade family has helped establish a market mechanism in the
Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
Old-time convoluted government meddling has been cleared out of
businesses, Wang noted. "Trade liberalization has proven to be
effective," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Long said last week China's current priority is to perfect a
market economy, no matter whether a time-table for WTO entry is
available or not.
</P>
<P>
A market economy, according to early British theorist Adam
Smith, is the very source of a nation's wealth, while a central
planned one usually stifles creativity.
</P>
<P>
Wang estimated China's foreign trade volume by 2010 to be
around 800 billion US dollars -- if the trading sector stays on
the right track.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Province to Green All Barren Hills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi province
has decided to designate the year 1997 as the "afforestation
year", in an effort to plant trees on all the barren hills within
two years, the China Forestry News reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the province's plan, this year trees will be
planted on a total of 300,000 hectares of mountainous sides, the
paper said, adding that at present the total area of remaining
barren hills suitable for tree-planting is 520,000 hectare.
</P>
<P>
During the past years the province has made great progress in
planting trees, with many cities and counties turned all their
barren hills green,
</P>
<P>
But, the paper noted, the task of afforestation of barren
mountains is still arduous, since most of the remaining barren
hills are in the loess areas where natural conditions are harsh.
</P>
<P>
"The whole province, including six million rural households,
should be mobilized for the afforestation drive," the paper quoted
Shaanxi vice-Governor Wang Shousen as saying.
</P>
<P>
In order to make a success of this year's afforestation effort,
the province decided to allocated five million yuan (600,000 US
dollars) for tree-planting.

<P>
GUIYANG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- People often regret, especially
about what they have done hesitantly.
</P>
<P>
But Chen Yongben from Taiwan was all smiles when recalling his
wavering decision six years ago to initiate an investment in
Dulaying, a col miles away from Guiyang, the capital city of
southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
"It demands real gut to set up joint ventures in this
mountain-surrounding area, but the result proved to be much better
than in coastal areas, " said the president of Taiwan Xuya Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Though only slightly interested in its Guizhou partner's
advantages on equipment, transportation and bamboo resources at
first, the Taiwan company increased its investment three months
later, immediately after the landlocked enterprise produced
quality samples. Today the venture has risen into the most
profitable investment of Xuya Group in the inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the booming economic development zones appealing for
foreign investors, the col, known as Dulaying, attracted no
foreign investment until six years ago.
</P>
<P>
But since then, overseas fund has been flocking there by the
day from the United States, France, Australia, Hong Kong and
Taiwan, making it a rising star in southwestern Guizhou province.
</P>
<P>
And there are already 14 joint ventures for the present, all of
them having a same partner -- Guiyang Freight Car Works.
</P>
<P>
Although moved to landlocked areas in inland Guizhou province
in a national strategy of industrial relocation to prepare for
major wars in 1960s, the freight car producer under the Ministry
of Railways still holds strong appeal to foreign capital due to
its great advantages on talents, technology, equipment and
management.
</P>
<P>
Actually, Guiyang Freight Car Works is not the only one of such
relocated old industrial firms which came out to be hot spots for
foreign capital after the opening-up drive was adopted.
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that infrastructure in Dulaying counts heavily in
luring more overseas funds. Besides a sufficient supply of water
and electrical power, the area also has convenient access to railway
transportation.

Manager from the US partner of the Sino-American Universal Wire
Rope Co. Ltd said he was deeply impressed with the outstanding
management expertise in the enterprise, which turned a
money-losing enterprise into profit-making and had its products
exported worldwide.
</P>
<P>
All the employees of these joint ventures originally worked in
the Guiyang Freight Car Works.
</P>
<P>
"They are just as good as workers in Shanghai," said Eric
Gravell, executive vice president of the American Pacific
Aviation &AMP; Technology Corp, a co-sponsor.
</P>
<P>
Besides a vast group of trained technicians, Guiyang Freight
Car Works also runs a special technical school to train more
professionals.
</P>
<P>
When the US company started to tap the Chinese market last
year, it launched two production lines in areas such as coastal
Shanghai, Nanjing, and Dulaying of Guizhou, respectively. Today
there are already 14 such production lines in Dulaying, making it
the company's biggest production base of micro-electrical
appliances in China.
</P>
<P>
"Both experts and our clients are satisfied with quality of
products from the joint venture in Dulaying, and personally I'm
definitely sure that more and more foreign businesses will come to
discover here an ideal place to make investment," said Eric
Gravell.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Gives Priority to Transportation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, a new municipality
directly under the central government following Beijing, Shanghai,
and Tianjin, will give priority to the construction of
transportation facilities in the near future.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2020, the city government is projected to invest
41.8 billion yuan (5 billion US Dollars) to build 4,680 km of
highways, including more than 950 km of superhighways, according
to its new plan.
</P>
<P>
Taking 1997 as the "Year of Road of Construction," the
government has poured a total of 2.5 billion yuan (301 million US
dollars) into this project this year, accounting for half of its
annual fiscal income.
</P>
<P>
Local transportation authorities told Xinhua that the
government plans to complete a network of highways centering on
Chongqing and covering a batch of national trunk highways and
peripheral roads, as well as a round-the-city expressway.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing area was once described as "more difficult than
ever" in a poem by Li Bai, a famous poet in the Tang Dynasty
(618-907).
</P>
<P>
Local transportation conditions have been improved after
decades of construction since 1949. At present, more than 27,000
km of highway have gone into operation in the city.
</P>
<P>
Limited by adverse geological landscape, however, including too
many rivers, mountains, and hillocks, the city's transportation
still cannot cater to economic expansion, authorities point out.
</P>
<P>
"Chongqing's economic growth should start from transportation,"
said Pu Haiqing, the newly-elected mayor.
</P>
<P>
This is also in response to the country's strategy of shifting
the focus of economic expansion to central and western areas, and
in line with the concrete conditions of the city -- Chongqing is
too big a city, and has too large tracts of rural areas, officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Thirteen Wounded in Albania During Election Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen people were reportedly
wounded by gun shoots on Thursday when Albanian President Sali
Berisha was addressing an election rally near this capital.
</P>
<P>
The president was not hurt in the shootouts at Elbasan, a town
about 30 kilometers southeast of Tirana, media reports said.
</P>
<P>
An Interior Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying that "five
armed men had fired in the air, then into the crowd" of thousands
of Berisha's supporters before the police responded.
</P>
<P>
But witnesses said they saw two men firing automatic weapons in
the air as the president was addressing the rally.
</P>
<P>
The two men were hurt in the subsequent shootouts along with
two police and two civilians, the witnesses said. But hospital
officials said seven people were wounded, including three
policemen and four civilians.
</P>
<P>
A separate gunfire between Berisha's bodyguards and armed
residents was reportedly to have occurred at a street corner, in
which six were wounded.
</P>
<P>
Berisha narrowly escaped an assassination attempt on June 4 at
Rushbull, 30 kilometers west of Tirana, during another campaign
function for the June 29 general elections.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 people have died and thousands injured in the
country since February this year, when the collapse of shady
investment schemes deprived many Albanians of their life savings
and triggered widespread violence.
</P>
<P>
The coming elections were designed to restore order in the
Balkan state.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Denounce Proposed Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) has denounced the proposed new budget as
"anti-people" and called upon the people to build a movement
against the budget.
</P>
<P>
"It's an anti-people, anti-development and pro-Indian budget,"
BNP Secretary General Mannan Bhuiyan told an instant street
protest after Finance Minister Shah AMS Kibria Thursday night
presented to the parliament the budget for the 1997-98 fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The budget has a total expenditure of 277.86 billion taka
(about 6.46 billion U.S. dollars) and leaves an overall deficit of
81.62 billion taka (about 1.9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The entire economy of the country would be destroyed if this
budget is to take effect, Bhuiyan charged.
</P>
<P>
A series of new tax measures, including expansion of the
value-added tax (VAT) to retailing for some items to obtain 3.82
billion taka (about 88.8 million dollars) in additional revenue,
were proposed in the budget to take effect on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The BNP leader said this budget would lead mills, factories and
industries to destruction through encouraging smuggling from
neighboring India.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jatiya Party Chairman HM Ershad, whose party
supported the Awami League to form the government, has also
criticized the new budget and said the present government will
have to bear all its liabilities.
</P>
<P>
"We can't call it a good budget. It's not a welfare-oriented
budget," he noted in his initial reaction to the national budget,
which he said has failed to increase expenditure on the
investment-oriented sectors.

<HEADLINE> Italy Aims to Qualify for EMU by 1999: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Italy will push forward with its
campaign to meet the criteria for Economic and Monetary Union
(EMU) by its launch date in 1999, Italian Treasury Minister Carlo
Azeglio Ciampi said here today.
</P>
<P>
Italy is ready to adopt the euro from the start, he said at a
reception for the country's Euro Committee at the presidential
Quirinale Palace.
</P>
<P>
It would be a big mistake to start out with a "mini" euro,
limited to a small number of countries in 1999, Ciampi said, as
the success of the single currency will be measured by the number
of countries involved and by a balance between participating
northern European and Mediterranean countries.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France have been divided over whether to impose a
strict reading of the Maastricht treaty, which requires countries
joining the euro to get their public deficits to below 3
percent of Gross Domestic Product.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi said Italy is fully aware of the economic stability
required for the implementation of the single currency and is
working to improve the economy. Rome has promised a three-year
plan to cut its debt and deficit.
</P>
<P>
Italy has approached "an advanced stage" of economic
convergence, he said, "we have slashed inflation, have the
strongest balance of payments in Europe and are correcting public
accounts."
</P>
<P>
However, a forecast by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development published today showed that Italy,
with, its deficit estimated at 3.2 percent of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) this year and likely to rise to 3.8 percent in 1998,
will not meet the Maastricht criteria.
</P>
<P>
It said France and Germany would also have a 3.2 percent
deficit/GDP ratio this year, but would cut them to 3.0 and 2.7
percent respectively in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi said Italy's efforts to revamp its economy were not only
launched for Maastricht. "... what we do for Europe and for
correcting our accounts ... are two aspects of the same thing," he
said.
</P>
<P>
An EU meeting in April and May 1998 will decide which countries
among the 15 EU members will qualify for the single currency at
its launch in 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Poland and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia signed five agreements here today to boost bilateral
economic ties.
</P>
<P>
The accords, covering cooperation in agriculture and food, health
and medical care and double taxation avoidance, were signed by Polish
Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz and visiting Yugoslav Prime
Minister Radoje Kontic.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony followed talks between the two on the
normalization and development of bilateral economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Cimoszewicz described Kontic's visit as an
important event and said with international sanctions against
Yugoslavia lifted, the time for the resumption of high-level
economic cooperation and the establishment of political relations
between the two nations had come.
</P>
<P>
Poland and Yugoslavia enjoyed good economic and trade ties
before the civil war broke out in former Yugoslavia with bilateral
trade at an annual 400 million U.S. dollars. It is now down to 60
million dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
Kontic arrived here today for a two-day working visit. He is due
to meet Polish President Alexander Kwasniewski tomorrow.

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari said here today that Hong Kong's return to China on July
1 will be a remarkable event.
</P>
<P>
On his 60th birthday party held in the presidential palace this
evening, Ahtisaari told reporters he trusts the Chinese
leadership to respect Hong Kong's status after its return.
</P>
<P>
China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on
July 1, ending Britain's 150-year rule over the region.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has promised that it will keep Hong Kong
unchanged as it is for 50 years under the policy of "one country,
two systems, Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong, a high degree
of autonomy, and prosperity and stability".
</P>
<P>
The Finnish president told Xinhua that he agreed with his
special adviser Alpo Rusi that China will develop into an economic
power in the 21st century. It's only a matter of time before China
gains the status of an economic power.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari said he was satisfied with the positive developments
in Finnish-Chinese relations in recent years, saying the two
countries have strengthened cooperation not only in politics and
trade, but also in legislation and other areas.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his meeting with Chinese President Jiang Zemin during
his visit to China in April, Ahtisaari said that he and Jiang
agreed that the two countries should try to double the bilateral
trade within three years.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Finland's domestic situation, the president said
Finland's economy is recovering and steadily growing at an annual
rate of 4.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
He promised the country would take steps to lower unemployment
from the present 15 percent to 10 percent or so by the end of
the century.
</P>
<P>
On international affairs, Ahtisaari said 1997 represents a
turning point in establishing a new European security structure
and Finland will continue to contribute to enhanced cooperation
and security in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that it was vital for the European Union to
remain strong and prosperous, urging it to seize the opportunity
to take in new members and optimize its foreign and security
policies.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Rodman Gets Fine and Apologizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The NBA issued a fine of 50,000
U.S. dollars on Chicago forward Dennis Rodman Thursday for a pair
of obscene and insensitive remarks about Mormons.
</P>
<P>
The fine is the biggest in NBA history, but the league stopped
short of suspending Rodman, who will be allowed to play Friday in
Game Six of the NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday in Salt Lake City, Rodman told a media gathering he
was having trouble getting his struggling game in sync because of
the "Mormons." Given an opportunity to retract the statement two
days later, he instead repeated it and offered no apology.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the fine, NBA Commissioner David Stern said that
actions that insensitive or derogatory comments involving race or
other classifications are unacceptable in the NBA. "Dennis
Rodman's comments were exactly the kind of offensive remarks that
cannot be tolerated or excused."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday morning, Rodman apologized for what he said.
</P>
<P>
"As far as religion, it's not about trying to put down
anybody's religion...I apologize for that," said Rodman.
</P>
<P>
But he was upset over the NBA fine. "They (NBA) have no reason,
no business to even get involved. Like I said, I apologize for the
religion," Rodman said.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls coach Phil Jackson also speak for his player. "To
Dennis, a Mormon may be just a nickname for people from Utah."
</P>
<P>
Rodman has been in trouble all season. The Bulls suspended him
two games in December for swearing during a live postgame
interview. In January, he drew an 11-game league ban and was fined
25,000 dollars for kicking a cameraman in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls player, who often dressed his hair with color in
playing games, was suspended for another game for a tussle with
Milwaukee Bucks forward Joe Wolf.

<HEADLINE> Japan Expects to Have Its Own Space Shuttle in 2010 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Science and Technology
Agency expects to have its own space shuttle by 2010, said a
Japanese press report available here today.
</P>
<P>
Research and development costs for the shuttle, capable of
shuttling cargo between Earth and orbit, will be included in the
fiscal 1998 budget, the report quoted officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
By replacing the current signal-use rockets with the shuttle,
the report said, Japan's launch-related expenditures will be cut
by 8.5 billion yen (about 74 million U.S. dollars) per mission.
</P>
<P>
Regular space missions are likely in the next century for
building an international space station and inevitable maintenance
calls for orbiting communications satellites, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's shuttle will be used in transporting personnel and
materials for such missions, it said.
</P>
<P>
To cut the cost, the shuttle is expected to be powered by
Japanese-made rocket engines based on the U.S.-made HZA rocket.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Opposes Foreign Interference, President Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic
said today that his country opposes outside interference in its
own affairs on the pretext of human rights and the issue of
minorities, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The country had become a target for foreign political pressure,
the news agency quoted the president as saying in a speech at a
military school.
</P>
<P>
Certain foreign forces, taking advantage of issues of human
rights and the rights of minorities in Kosovo, southern
Serbia, had exerted political pressure on the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
So far as Kosovo was concerned, the problem was not one of
expanding autonomy there, but of some Albanian nationalists in the
region not recognizing the country's constitution, he said.
</P>
<P>
These people, trying every means to internationalize the issue,
wanted to set up an independent "republic of Kosovo," and then
might integrate it into some other country, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, an autonomous province of over 10,000 square kilometers
in southern Serbia, one of Yugoslavia's two republics, is home to
some 2 million people, 90 percent of whom are ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Some Albanians there have long wanted to set up an independent
state of their own in the region.

<HEADLINE> Nepali MP Refuses to Join Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Just a day after Prakash Chandra
Lohani resigned as the Nepali foreign minister, another member
from his party turned down the portfolio offered him in the
cabinet reshuffle following Lohani's resignation.
</P>
<P>
MP Mahendra Raya, who was given the portfolio of state minister
for land reforms and management, said Thursday evening that he had
refused to join the ruling coalition led by Prime Minister
Lokendra Bahadur Chand, who is from his own National Democratic
Party (RPP), The Kathmandu Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
Raya told a press briefing held at Lohani's residence that he
met Chand Thursday morning following the announcement of his
appointment, but he rejected the offer despite pressures from the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Raya said he had written to the prime minister expressing his
aversion to take up the post offered to him "since I feel it is
not proper to carry on the coalition with the UML in the present
context."
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the growing size of the cabinet, saying it
was against the government's avowed policy of sleek governance.
</P>
<P>
Besides Lohani and Raya, three other RPP lawmakers were also
present at the press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Lohani, who resigned as foreign minister Wednesday in protest
against alleged widespread irregularities in the local elections,
said at the press briefing that the coalition in the present
political context is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chand appointed a new foreign minister from his
cabinet and expanded it by inducting three RPP MPs including Raya.
</P>
<P>
Lohani said he has not pressured any of his colleagues in the
government to resign, but is confident that they would take their
decision according to their conscience.
</P>
<P>
"The individual efforts of party members have to be transformed
into a collective effort," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chand formed the present government with the participation of
the CPN-UML in March when he managed to topple the former
coalition by withdrawing his RPP party from it.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Launch New Development Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government will
launch a new massive rural development plan with income and
employment generation as the prime objective, according to a
Presidential Secretariat release.
</P>
<P>
"In future we will attempt to provide the type of projects that
would promote self-employment and training for self-employment,"
the release quoted President Chandrika Kumaratunga as saying here
Thursday evening while addressing representatives of donor
countries, agencies and implementing authorities.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure projects such as minor roads and small
irrigation works would also be one of the prime aspects to be
implemented under the new rural economic development plan, she
said.
</P>
<P>
The country first launched an Integrated Rural Development
Program in 1978 and the program is still being implemented in 15
districts at an annual cost of 20.6 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The president said the program will be re-oriented in keeping
with the new focus, according to the release.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the president as saying that during the past many
years successive governments implemented many welfare schemes such
as free food, free health services and free education.
</P>
<P>
These had helped create a comparatively highly educated and
healthy society but one that was economically poor, she said,
noting that in view of the present needs, there is no alternative
but to re-orientate development programs toward income-generating
schemes for sustainable development.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress today passed
an 8.6-billion-U.S. dollar disaster aid bill after stripping it of
provisions that sparked a veto by President Clinton earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
The bill was approved by a vote of 78-21 in the Senate and
348-74 in the House, paving the way for President Clinton to sign
it into law soon.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement, Clinton said he applauded Congress for
approving a compromise disaster relief bill that will pump money
into states racked by natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was "especially pleased" the Republican
majority in Congress "heeded the call of common sense" by passing
a bill that did not include two unrelated riders.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, 5.6 billion U.S. dollars will be provided for
emergency relief for victims of disasters in 35 states, and 1.9
billion dollars to support a Bosnia peacekeeping mission and
maintain a no-fly zone over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Two controversial provisions that Republicans inserted into the
vetoed bill were dropped from the replacement measure.
</P>
<P>
One was designed to prevent a government shutdown this fall and
the other was a proposal to ban sampling in the next U.S. census.

BANGKOK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's national blood bank is
facing a serious shortage of blood, which has significantly
affected medical services for people around the country, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's National Blood Center collects 25,000 to 28,000
units of blood each month, but hospitals nationwide require 30,000
to 33,000 units monthly for their patients, Chaivej Nujproyoon,
head of the blood bank, said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The center can supply only 700 to 800 units of blood a day,
while daily demand from hospitals is at least 1,000 units,
Chaivej was quoted today as saying by local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Lack of blood supply often causes delay of surgery operations
on patients, he added.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the blood from the center is used for
surgery and the rest for patients who need blood transfusions as
part of their treatment, according to the official.

<HEADLINE> New Memory Drug Offers Hope to Alzheimer's Sufferers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- American scientists have shown how
a drug can improve working memory, the part of a human being's
memory used to temporarily hold information, the Daily Telegraph
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The study, the first to use a brain scanner on the
memory-enhancing drug physostigmine, gives hope to those who
suffer from Alzheimer's disease and patients with other memory
problems.
</P>
<P>
Dr Maura Furey, lead scientist of the study carried out by
the National Institute on Ageing in Bethesda, Maryland, in the
United States, said that volunteers given the drug were better at
recognizing faces they had seen.
</P>
<P>
She suggested that since physostigmine improved the brain's
response to memory tasks, similar drugs enhancing the so-called
"cholinergic system" might help Alzheimer's sufferers.
</P>
<P>
The drug might enhance efficiency by focusing on the task at
hand, or it could help minimize the effects of distracting
stimuli.
</P>
<P>
Either way, a more efficient working memory could be a great
help to those with Alzheimer's disease.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee today passed a bill clearing the way for
payment of U.S. arrears to the United Nations, but with
substantial conditions attached.
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved by a vote of 14-4, was described by
Democrats and Republicans as the best possible arrangement
hammered out during four months of detailed bipartisan
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the U.S. will pay the United Nations 819
million U.S. dollars in back dues. But in return, the world body
must cut spending and staff and reduce Washington's annual dues.
</P>
<P>
The bill said that the United States would pay the debt only
when the United Nations agrees to reduce the U.S.'s contribution
to its regular budget from 25 percent to 20 percent within three
years, and its share of the peacekeeping budget from 31 to 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been sharply criticized by other
U.N. members, including its allies, for not paying its U.N. dues in
time.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations says the United States owes it some
1.4 billion dollars, but Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, insists that the figure is 819
million dollars.

BANGKOK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- A Thai textile mission will visit
Italy and Germany from June 14 to 22 to promote trade in textiles,
according to the Thai Industry Ministry.
</P>
<P>
the delegation, to be led by Thai Deputy Industry Minister
Sompob Amartayakul, will meet textile industry entrepreneurs in
Rome, Milan, Bonn and the German state of Saxony in a bid to
persuade them to buy more Thai textiles.
</P>
<P>
Sompob was quoted today by the local press as saying Italy is a
highly successful exporter of garments worldwide despite its high
labor costs. Thailand's textile industry should be developed in a
similar way to cope with the rising cost of labor here.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the delegation returns to Thailand, it would
keep in touch with the Italian and German entrepreneurs to pursue
trade and investment relations and the transfer of technology.

<HEADLINE> Thai Army Denies Placing Order for U.S. Tanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Army has dismissed the
report that it is ordering 107 tanks from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Lt.-Gen. Chokechai Hongthong, deputy chief-of-staff of the Thai
Army, was quoted today by the local press as saying the army had
not ordered any tanks from the United States since 125 M60A3 tanks
were bought in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The denial followed a news agency report that the United States
was to sell M60AS tanks as part of a 100 million U.S. dollar deal
that included training and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the tanks ordered had yet to be delivered.
</P>
<P>
"We have not ordered one tank from the United States since
then," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, an army source said Thailand still needs tanks. He
noted that the army, which plans to buy 200 new tanks to replace
the M41s which have been in use for nearly three decades, is
considering U.S. M60s or Stingray 2s and German Leopards.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Expert Warns Authorities of "El Nino" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A Peruvian meteorology expert has
warned of the potential damage to the country from the
increasingly frequent occurrence of the weather phenomenon known
as El Nino, characterized by heavy rain and storms.
</P>
<P>
He has called on the government to strengthen and reinforce
river bridges so that they can resist the substantial increases in
the volume of water currents El Nino could bring.
</P>
<P>
Ena Jaimes Espinosa, director of Climatology at the National
Meteorology and Hydrology (Senamhi) was quoted in the media today
as saying authorities must take into account the increasing
frequency of El Nino to anticipate potential problems caused by
changes in weather patterns.
</P>
<P>
El Nino's frequency has increased from once every eight years
to once every four years, Espinosa said. It is caused by
extraordinary water currents initiated from the eastern part of
the Pacific Ocean and typically causes temperatures in the Pacific
Ocean off the coast of Peru to rise one to two, or sometimes two
to five degrees higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
The phenomenon generally appears around Christmas time, but its
latest appearance started in the autumn, Espinosa said.
</P>
<P>
This change implies that the consequences cannot be anticipated
yet.
</P>
<P>
"The phenomenon is in its initial phase in our country. The
establishment and development stages are yet to come. However, it
is difficult to say what can happen," Espinosa said.

<HEADLINE> Traditional Mongolian Medicine Thrives in Inner Mongolia (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, June 13 (Xinhua) -- As part of the effort to develop
traditional Chinese medicine, the government has stressed research
on ancient Mongolian medicine and made it boom over the past 50
years.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian ethnic group is one of China's 55 national
minorities. The majority of its people live in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region in north China. With its unique theoretical
system and diagnostic methods, Mongolian medicine is a key
component of China's traditional herbal medicine.
</P>
<P>
With a history of 2,000 years, Mongolian medicine is also a
major part of the Mongolians' outstanding culture.
</P>
<P>
"Mongolian medicine has its unique advantages in treating
chronic and difficult diseases, such as stomach trouble, liver and
gall disorder, coronary heart disease, gynecological disease, and
problems related to blood, skin and bone," said Uliji Tugus,
vice-president of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Hospital
for Chinese and Mongolian Medicine.
</P>
<P>
The senior specialist in Mongolian medicine said clinical
research on this type of medicine has made considerable progress
in recent years. The treatment of hemiparalysis caused by
cerebrovascular accident, a method developed by doctors at the
hospital, was awarded by the Ministry of Health as a major
scientific achievement.
</P>
<P>
And the doctors have also developed therapies for blood
platelet-related disease, anemia, hepatitis B, impotence and
rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
In traditional Mongolian medicine, five magic therapies--
acupuncture, moxibustion, medicinal bathing, massage and blood
letting-- had been widely used but were nearly lost in modern
times.
</P>
<P>
Ulan, a 34-year-old woman doctor with the hospital, has
retrieved the lost therapies through painstaking research over
eight years. Her achievement in relieving the pain of patients has
won approval from her counterparts both in China and around the
world.

An injured Japanese sportsman, at the suggestion of the World
Health Organization (WHO), came to the hospital in 1991, when he
was unable to walk or remember things. After being treated for one
and a half months, he resumed his memory and was able to walk
again.
</P>
<P>
A patient from the People's Republic of Mongolia, who had
suffered from a knee joint spur, had to undergo amputation
according to the diagnosis of foreign doctors.
</P>
<P>
Reluctant to receive such a surgical operation, he came here
and was treated in Mongolian medicine for two and a half months,
he saved his leg which had improved greatly.
</P>
<P>
Uliji said that recommended by WHO since 1990, the hospital has
received dozens of overseas patients who suffered from chronic
rheumatoid arthritis, cerebral hemorrhage and bed-wetting, and the
treatment proved effective and satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1958, the hospital is located in the central
part of Hohhot, capital city of Inner Mongolia, as a center for
traditional Chinese and Mongolian medicine, and medical research
and training.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region 50
years ago, it has established 45 institutions related to Mongolian
medicine, including six research institutes, one medical college
and four secondary schools with more than 3,800 professionals in
Mongolian medicine.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, medical workers have collected more
than 550 classical works in Mongolian medicine and published some
50 medical works. Medical workers have also presented over 1,000
academic papers in China and overseas. In addition, they have
collected 1,200 traditional prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, medical scholars from Mongolia, the
Commonwealth of Independent States, Poland, Hungary, Japan, the
Republic of Korea, the United States and Britain have come here to
study Mongolian medicine.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Province to Green All Mountains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province in northeast
China plans to bring greenery to all its mountains by the end of
1998.
</P>
<P>
The province's forest area has increased from 2.8 million
hactares in 1949 to the present 4.67 million hectares over the
past four decades and more, with a forest reserve volume of 180
million cubic meters. But there are still 700,000 hectares of
barren hills in the province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Guangdong Province in south China made all its
barren hills green seven years ago, becoming the first province in
China to eliminate barren hills. The number of such provinces as
Guangdong rose to 13 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Forestry set forth a goal of having additional
nine such provinces by the end of the century, which will include
Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Most of the barren hills in Liaoning are located in
economically-backward counties and regions, with adverse natural
conditions and low precipitation.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has decided to increase bonuses to
those counties and regions for fulfilling the task of planting
trees on barren hills, and financial input in the afforestation
drive at all government levels.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, various kinds of preferences, including those for
share holding system, contract signing, and drawing foreign
investment, have been worked out by the provincial government to
encourage more people to participate in the drive.

<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- China Post under the Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications will speed up express mail service
(EMS) deliveries between major Chinese cities and Hong Kong this
month, today's China Daily quoted a China Post official as saying.
</P>
<P>
From June 16 to August 15, express mail will be delivered to
customers on the following day between eight mainland cities and
Hong Kong, said Xu Kuai, deputy director of China Post.
</P>
<P>
The cities are Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Nanjing,
Hangzhou, Xiamen and Shantou. And express mail from Tianjin,
Zhuhai, Suzhou, and Wuxi can also arrive in Hong Kong the next day.
</P>
<P>
EMS deliveries rely heavily on aircraft, Xu said, adding that
China Post has gained the support from and cooperation with the Civil
Aviation Administration of China(CAAC), and customs departments.
</P>
<P>
China Post will give a 30 percent discount to EMS deliveries
whose destination is Hong Kong during this period, to mark the
forthcoming return of Kong Kong to the motherland on July 1, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The move is also aimed at competing for a bigger EMS market
with foreign-funded EMS companies operating in China, which have
an upper hand in the Chinese market, forcing China Post's market
share to gradually decrease.
</P>
<P>
China Post began to provide express mail service 17 years ago,
and has set up EMS links with more than 200 countries and
regions.

HAVANA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's steel output rose 36 percent
to 137,200 tons in the first five months of the year over the same

<P>
Based on this figure, the authorities predicted today that the

Rising production has been accompanied by lower spending per
ton on raw materials, electricity and fuel.

Cuba's steel output has been increasing steadily over the last

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 13 (Xinhua) -- The inland, underdeveloped city of
Liupanshui will take advantage of its natural resources, open
itself to the outside world in a major effort to turn over a new
leaf, and become Southwest China's energy powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
Guan Yanhe, secretary of the committee of the Chineses
Communist Party of Liupanshui, told China Daily that other cities
are advancing with giant strides while Liupanshui has lagged far
behind.
</P>
<P>
"We must not procrastinate until the situation turns worse,"
Guan said.
</P>
<P>
The city is rich in natural resources with over 30 kinds of
minerals from coal, iron, lead, zinc, copper, silver, gold,
limestone, dolomite and barite to iceland spar.
</P>
<P>
Its large reserves of high-quality, easy-to-mine coal won
Liupanshui the titles of "coal metropolis of the south" and "the
black pearl."
</P>
<P>
But burdened with sluggish enterprises, insufficient
infrastructure and lack of capital, Liupanshui, with a population
of 2.6 million consisting of 38 nationalities living in 9,914
square meters, trails far behind China's booming coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
Guan noted that the opportunity is here. Under the Ninth
Five-year Plan (1996-2000), the State Council, together with other
State ministries and Guizhou province, plans to build Liupanshui
into a super-scale mineral development area and a center of
coal-derived electricity, coal chemistry, iron and steel, building
materials and aluminium.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Yi Shengjin said the city's development plan and strategy
set the target of the city's gross domestic product at 4.8 billion
yuan (578 million US dollars) by 2000, compared with 2.9 billion
yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
To accomplish that, the city must achieve an average yearly
growth rate of 10.5 percent from 1996 to 2000. And for its GDP to
reach the expected 13.6 billion yuan by 2010, an average annual
growth rate of 11 percent curing the 2000-2010 period will be
called for.
</P>
<P>
To secure those goals, Mayor Yi said the city government will
carry out the opening of the city with a series of preferential
polities not only to attract investment, but to introduce
technology and bring in capable personnel from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city mayor described Liupanshui as a virgin place
for overseas investment and also a place full of fortune and
opportunity.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Old Movies a Hit in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 13 (Xinhua) -- Nostalgia is mixing with the
spirit of celebration here among townspeople who are expressing
their feelings for the return of Hong Kong by watching old Hong
Kong movies.
</P>
<P>
Recently, downtown cinemas kicked off a retrospective show of
Hong Kong films shot over the past four decades. Box office sales
topped those of new releases, and ticket sellers report that
phones are ringing non-stop from callers wanting show times.
</P>
<P>
Some hard-core fans can recall their experience 10 or 20 years
ago when they stood in line overnight for a ticket to see movies
such as "Three Smiles," a romantic comedy about an ancient scholar
and a pretty housemaid. The movie is remembered especially for
breathing fresh air into Chinese cinemas in the aftermath of the
Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
"Black market prices used to deter me in those days," said
movie-goer Mao Juan. "Now I've got a chance to see these movies,
and I won't let it go."
</P>
<P>
She's not alone: a man in his 40s braved a two-hour bus ride
from the outskirts of town just to catch a morning movie. And one
young man who was low on cash left his pager at the ticket office as
collateral for a ticket, and came back for it the next day. Many
women have called the cinemas urging that each movie be shown more
than once -- in case they miss the first viewing.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai cinemas have responded well to their customers, adding
additional movie showings, and bringing to town 14 more old Hong
Kong movies from nearby Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and also
Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks Business Leaders Help for China's MFN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton today
asked U.S. business leaders to convince Congress of the necessity
to extend the Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status to China for
the coming year.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Business Round Table, an association of
business executives, Clinton said, "What... I hope you will say to
members of Congress in both parties is that this (MFN status)
is... about what is in the interest of the American people and
what is most likely to give us the largest amount of influence and
cooperation with China in the years ahead."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said every president since 1980 has extended MFN to
China. "Ending that would end our strategic dialogue," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said MFN is the most wrongly worded term in government
language, and the United States just simply seeks to continue the
status quo, treating China as "we do" other normal trading
partners.

<HEADLINE> Canada Still Best Place to Live: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada is still the best place to
live, according to this year's United Nations Human Development
Report officially released today.
</P>
<P>
For the fourth time in a row, Canada has claimed the top spot
on the UN Development Program's human-development index, which
measures life expectancy, literacy and income.
</P>
<P>
France, Norway and the United States came next in line.
</P>
<P>
Canada also scored first on a separate gender-related index,
which measures the status of women. That was an improvement from
last year's second-place showing.
</P>
<P>
"This year's report shows that Canada not only remains the best
country in the world, but that we continue to improve our living
standards," Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said in a
statement today.
</P>
<P>
"I am also very pleased that Canada ranked number one on the
gender-related development index. We will work hard to maintain
this position and to advance in other areas, especially youth
employment," Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the confidence that new jobs and improved economic
conditions would come with the progress in restructuring public
finances.
</P>
<P>
"Canada's position in the world, as ranked in this report, is a
feather in our cap," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"But it also means that we have a great responsibility, not
only to all Canadians, but to the less fortunate in developing
countries," he added.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Surges Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar ended a weeklong
decline today with the biggest one-day jump against the yen in
nearly two years after Japan's top foreign-exchange policymaker
said the Japanese currency was too strong.
</P>
<P>
Traders who had bet on further dollar drops turned to buy the
dollar instead as it rose on the comments by Eisuke Sakakibara,
director of the Finance Ministry's international finance bureau,
early in the trading day.
</P>
<P>
The dollar touched an intraday high of 115.70 yen before
settling in New York at 114.25 yen, up 3.05 yen or 2.7 percent
from 111.20 yen Wednesday. It was the biggest one-day rise in the
dollar against the yen since a 4.15-yen advance on August 15,
1995, and erased much of the U.S. currency's retreat over the past
week.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also cost 1.7300 marks, up from 1.7160 Wednesday and
the highest level since May 5. The pound cost 1.6316 U.S. dollars,
down from 1.6377 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other late-dollar rates in New York compared with late
Wednesday: 1.4436 Swiss francs, up from 1.4375; 5.8360 French
francs, up from 5.0835; 1,698.85 Italian lire, up from 1,694.50;
1.3842 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3873.

<HEADLINE> US Congress Cannot Legislate for UN: Annan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said here today that the United States Congress could not
legislate for the other 184 U.N. members, who might not accept its
conditions for paying back dues.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a bill on paying 819 million dollars of U.S.
arrears with a number of conditions, Annan told a news conference,
"One can discuss these things in Congress. It does not mean that
it is going to become law in the U.N. It does not necessarily mean
that the member states are going to accept it."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. owes the world organization 1.3 billion dollars,
accounting for more than half of the total outstanding
contributions.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. would have to come and negotiate and
discuss with the other member states. It was going to be quite a
challenge for U.S. diplomacy, he added.

Annan said the U.S. government realized this. He did not think
that Congress could take decisions and impose them unilaterally on
the other 184 member states.
</P>
<P>
As a condition of the U.S. payment, the bill before the
Republican-dominated Congress would demand a string of U.N.
spending cuts, a reduction in U.S. annual dues and other
concessions.
</P>
<P>
As the legislation was still being negotiated between the U.S.
government and Congress, Annan said he was very pleased with a
speech by Senator Richard Lugar, a leading Republican senator, who
pressed for U.S. fulfillment of its obligations.
</P>
<P>
Annan said, "The president himself is convinced that the U.N.
is essential for the United States, just as we need the U.S. to
participate actively in this organization. He also believes that
if the United States is going to lead and play an effective role
in this organization, it has to pay its way."

The secretary-general said he was briefed by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and the State Department last week on the very
tough and delicate negotiations between the government and
Congress.

NEW YORK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rocked to record
highs for the fifth consecutive session today, as a weak May
retail sales report erased any worries or fear that the Federal
Reserve would soon raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average pushed through 7,600 easily
and then sailed past 7,700 to close at 7,711.47.

<P>
The Dow jumped 135.64 points for the whole session. The
blue-chip gauge is up over 20 percent from its intraday low on
April 14.

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 592.73 million
shares as against 513.74 million in the previous session.

The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 13.19 to 882.76, and

gain of 0.3 percent in May.
