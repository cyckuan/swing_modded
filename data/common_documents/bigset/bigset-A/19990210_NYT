   ATLANTA _ In the final, frenzied push before the International
Olympic Committee's vote to award the 1996 Centennial Games,
Atlanta bid chief Billy Payne considered a college scholarship,
medical treatment and free plane tickets as gifts for IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   In a memorandum Payne addressed to a top aide, he suggested
inducements such as a University of Georgia scholarship for IOC
Executive Board member Pal Schmitt's daughter and an invitation for
medical treatment from the Emory Clinic to Bashir Mohamed
Attarabulsi, the Libyian IOC member who recently resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum, written Aug. 20, 1990, one month to the day
before the announcement of Atlanta's stunning win in Tokyo, is the
first evidence Payne even considered gifts for IOC members that he
acknowledges today were ``out-of-bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne said Tuesday he doesn't remember the memo, but concedes he
must have written it after it emerged in a search of Olympic
records currently stored at the Atlanta History Center. He also
said he does not recall whether he sent the memo, which was
addressed to his bid team colleague Ginger Watkins. Nor does he
believe any of his suggestions were acted upon.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to characterize the environment in which he wrote
the memo, Payne said the final few weeks before the vote were
``unbelieveably tense and busy,'' and the competition among the six
bidding cities ``was fierce.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In those frantic few weeks before the announcement, I was
continually thinking out loud about things which might have made a
difference in our campaign,'' he acknowledged. ``None of these
directives were ever seriously discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the memo was ever sent _ and I suspect it never was since
no one remembers receiving it _ none of those suggestions, which
could have been deemed inappropriate, were ever acted upon,'' Payne
said.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins said Tuesday she didn't remember receiving the memo,
titled ``Personal Gift List'', and agreed with Payne that even if
she did, none of his suggestions was acted upon. ``None of the
things that are on there ever occurred,'' she said Tuesday, sitting
at a table in the History Center archives with the original copy of
the memo in front of her.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the memorandum was sent to the Atlanta Journal-Consti-
tution this week. When queried about the memo Monday, Payne's
attorney and Watkins searched the records and found the original in
a box containing some of Watkins' files.
</P>
<P>
   Payne's memo suggested an array of gifts, such as complimentary
airline tickets for two IOC members from South America; a suit of
clothes made by a specific Korean haberdasher for the member from
Panama; and a letter showing support for Atlanta signed by all the
members of the U.S. Supreme Court for the head of the IOC's
juridical commission.
</P>
<P>
   The most damaging gift ideas, however, were the medical
treatment for Attarabulsi and a tennis scholarship for Schmitt's
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The first item on the list was headed ``Attarabulsi.''
Underneath that name, Payne suggested they come up with ``a letter
from Emory Clinic acknowledging that we would like him to come to
Atlanta for medical treatment whenever he needs it and an offer to
pay his air transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   An Emory Clinic spokeswoman said corporate policy prohibited the
clinic from confirming or denying whether Attarabulsi ever received
treatment. Attarabulsi, an IOC member since 1977, resigned from the
IOC because of revelations that his son, Suhel, received tuition to
attend an English language center at Brigham Young University and a
community college, plus $700 a month for expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the name Pal Schmitt, Payne wrote: ``Get a letter from the
University of Georgia offering a scholarship to his daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   A UGA spokesman said there is no record of Schmitt's daughter,
Petra, attending the university. She enrolled at the University of
Southern California in 1992 and was two-time all-American on the
tennis team.
</P>
<P>
   That perk came with the aid of Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice
president from Los Angeles. DeFrantz acknowledged she telephoned
the former athletics director at USC and asked him to consider a
position on the tennis team for Schmitt's daughter. She denied
trying to sway Schmitt's vote toward Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz and Schmitt are members of the IOC's 11-member
executive board.
</P>
<P>
   Schmitt is on the IOC's special investigation panel reporting on
allegations that Salt Lake City bidders bribed IOC members with
scholarships for their relatives, free medical care and lavish
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said he believes providing medical treatment and
scholarships would be improper. But he suggests because his
proposal to do just that was dismissed is ``testimony to the high
standards, under enormous pressures, used by our team in pursuit of
the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   The other six gift ideas on his list were simply personal items
that would have fallen within the IOC's rules at the time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only ones that would have been out-of-bounds would have
been the offer of free non-emergency medical assistance and the
scholarship,'' he said. ``I was brain dumping, which is not
uncharacteristic of me. For every good idea I had, I had a thousand
bad ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Payne said he never acted on his bad ideas, they
likely will come under the scrutiny of the IOC, which, in the wake
of revelations of payoffs in Salt Lake City, is investigating all
candidate cities from 1996 through 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has sent an inquiry letter to the U.S. Olympic Committee
seeking any evidence of improprieties in Atlanta's bid. Payne said
he has not received a formal inquiry from the USOC or the IOC.
However, he has prepared a response that maintains the Atlanta bid
team violated no laws or Olympic rules. It also asserts no bribes
or inappropriate gifts were sought by IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, no specific evidence of wrongdoing has surfaced in
the Atlanta bid. And Payne and Watkins both contend that none will.
``Our Games were won fairly,'' Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the memo does indicate that Payne, who has vigorously
portrayed Atlanta's bid in the world press as squeaky clean, was at
least pondering some of the same types of gifts that have forced
the expulsion of nine IOC members. Four have already resigned.
</P>
<P>
   And Payne and his lawyers still decline to release their 4,000
boxes of Olympic records _ which could verify his claim _ to the
public. He said they will be made public after they are inventoried
and archived, although some will be released individually if needed
to refute specific allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are private records,'' said Joe Bankoff, the King &AMP;
Spalding lawyer who combed the boxes with Watkins to unearth the
original memo. ``When a specific issue is raised we will respond.
But we are not going to make the documents generally available.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne and other members of the volunteer bid team have
acknowledged extensive pampering of visiting IOC members, which
included first-class air travel, luxury accommodations, dinner in
private homes, chaffeured venue tours and bountless small gifts.
Local corporations, including Cox Enteprises provided private jets
to fly IOC members to and fro. Many went golfing at Augusta
National Golf Club, others went yachting on Malcolm Forbes'
Highlander, docked in Savannah _ all in the name of courtship.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for IOC votes in the final two years of the bid
effort, cost $7.8 million for everything from travel and
entertainment to publishing a slick five-volume bid book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we spent less than our competition when we bid for
the Games, it was a high-stakes endeavor to show the best of
Atlanta, the quality of our people and our desire to host the
Games,'' Payne said Tuesday. ``Competition, as in all years, was
fierce.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Atlanta bid team's secret weapon was personalized gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A part of our plan was to try and find small personal gifts
that meant something to each IOC member,'' Watkins explained.
``There were discussions among the people on the committee that
knew the IOC members, what are their interests, what are their
hobbies.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the months leading up to the bid, the personal entreaties
flowed. There was a print of a building at Amherst College for
Prince Albert of Monaco, an alumnus; a carved walking stick for an
IOC delegate from San Juan who walked with a cane; and a bulldog
for a Cuban IOC delegate who admired a statue of the University of
Georgia mascot in Payne's office, among others.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the suggested gifts on Payne's list are simply more
of the same.
</P>
<P>
   He sought ``some kind of horse memorabilia'' from Cot Campbell,
for Phillipp von Schoeller, an Austrian show-jumping champion.
Campbell is a Georgian who owns the reputable Dogwood Stables and
races top-notch thoroughbreds.
</P>
<P>
   He considered a ``signed card from hundreds of school children''
in Savannah inviting the IOC's now-retired Irish delegate, Kevin
Patrick O'Flanagan back to grand marshall another parade.
O'Flanagan marshalled the St. Patrick's Day parade earlier in the
year. Payne suggested tossing a photo of him at that event in with
the card.
</P>
<P>
   For Raymond Gafner, a now retired IOC member from Switzerland,
Payne thought ``an agreement to publish his novel in English''
would be nice. Gafner has published several books in French, but
none have ever been publishing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Payne suggested complimentary American Airlines tickets for Ivan
Dibos from Peru and Fidel Mendoza from Columbia. Watkins believes
the two may have been attending an International All-Star Baseball
game in Atlanta two days later, but she did not know if the tickets
were provided or if the IOC members actually came.
</P>
<P>
   For Virgilio de Leon, a retired member from Panama, Payne
considered calling the owner of L.A. Town in Korea and ordering up
a suit. Payne apparently knew at the time de Leon bought clothes
there, and the owner would have his measurements.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, Payne dreamed big when he hoped for the signatures
of support of the entire U.S. Supreme Court for Juge Keba Mbaye of
Senegal, who is the honorary chief justice of the Supreme Court of
Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   Today Payne laughs at that possibility. ``I know no judges on
the supreme court; I know that was not produceable. No one took
these musings as anything but that -- musings. ``
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Payne is a dreamer,'' said Watkins, who worked at
Payne's side through the 10-year effort to win and organize the
Games. ``We wouldn't have had these Games in Atlanta if Billy
hadn't been a dream, thinking big, thinking creatively. You can't
take a person who is a dream and put him in a box and say you can't
have any big ideas for two years.''

   AMMAN _ Two Jordans buried their king Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There was the formal, westernized nation with its Scottish-style
bagpipers and new, English-accented monarch who invited the world's
statesmen to bury the ``fallen warrior'' on his polished gun
carriage, Hussein's Arab steed _ empty boots reversed in the
stirrups _ clopping obediently behind the coffin.
</P>
<P>
   And what the world saw _ indeed, what the world was supposed to
see _ was the adoration of kings, presidents, prime ministers and
princes: Clinton, Bush, Blair, Assad, Yeltsin, Chirac, Charles,
Shamir, Netanyahu, Mubarak, Weizman, Arafat, Sharon, Carter,
Ford... After all, was this not the man whom the American president
had already consigned to paradise?
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the other Jordan. Outside the gate, sweating and
shrieking to God, smashed back by gun butts, sworn at by the
descendants of Glubb Pasha's Arab Legion as they clawed their way
towards King Hussein's coffin, the other Jordan didn't quite fit in
with the pageantry on the other side of the palace wall.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jordanians broke through the troops and charged in
their thousands towards the gates, they were confronted by hundreds
more armed soldiers. ``In the name of God, help me,'' an old woman
moaned as the crowd stamped her into the mud.
</P>
<P>
   So which was the real Jordan? Was it the nation enshrined just
above the marble floor of the Rhagadan Palace, where the coffin of
the king was honored, prayed to, watched and nodded at by all the
dangerous, untrustworthy allies who had variously loved, hated or
plotted against him?
</P>
<P>
   Such sincerity, such affection they all showed Monday. There was
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who sent his killer
squad into Jordan only a few months ago to assassinate a Hamas
official, bowing stiffly before the coffin.
</P>
<P>
   There was American ex-President George Bush who just eight years
ago regarded Hussein as little more than an enemy agent.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, whose gunmen once sought to
destroy Hussein's kingdom, snapped to attention in his olive
fatigues and kuffiah scarf, twice saluting the flag-draped wooden
box in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   And behind the coffin, scarcely moving, was the studied, often
frowning face of King Abdullah the Second and his two
half-brothers, Crown Prince Hamzeh and Prince Hashem.
</P>
<P>
   They stood there, hands out in prayer from time to time, all
dressed in immaculate suits and ties and all wearing the same kind
of checkered red-and-white kuffiah as Arafat.

   I suppose it wasn't surprising that history was being rewritten
for the watching world. On the satellite television channels, the
dead king was being eulogized as the man who freely made peace with
Israel, whose country was praised _ this from CNN _ because it was
now closer to Israel than to many Arab states.
</P>
<P>
   So forget what the king once privately called the ``manacles''
of the Oslo agreement _ which forced Jordan into an unpopular peace
treaty with Israel _ and remember what President Clinton told us on
Sunday: that King Hussein is now in paradise. Which is where we
were told Egyptian President Anwar Sadat had gone after his death _

   As for the crowds, whose voices could be heard baying beyond the
palace gates by the beautifully-groomed kings and presidents
inside, they had somewhat different ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they loved the king, some of them. But there was less
enthusiasm for Abdullah and much less for Prince Hamzeh, Hussein's
son by his last wife, the half-American Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamzeh was chosen as new crown prince by the United States,''
a girl insisted. She was a Palestinian Jordanian.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbish, I snorted. You shouldn't believe in the ``moammarer,''
the plot, I told her. But then, an hour later, I saw the full list
of dignitaries at the palace and was struck by the list of State
Department men, the boys from the Washington ``peacemaking''
department led by Martin Indyk _ former head of the largest Israeli
lobby group and the man who somehow couldn't manage to persuade
Netanyahu to stop building Jewish settlements on Arab land but
insists that Arafat must ``crack down on terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   So was the real Jordan, then, among the swaying mass of
shabbily-dressed, shouting youth on the highway to the royal
palace, many of them poorly educated, some of them pathetically
adorned with crinkled pictures of the dead king glued to their
shirts and scarves?
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan has a 90 percent literacy rate _ thanks, of course, to
the late king _ then I had come across an oddly unrepresentative
sample of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   They were peasant families, many of them, the old women's faces
covered in tattoos, the men sitting quietly on blankets under the
trees alongside the palace road. &QL;

<P>
   But when the king's coffin approached, a kind of ripple, half
sound and half movement, spread through the lines of tired, somehow
broken faces, as if a stone had been thrown into a human pond.
</P>
<P>
   There was no signal from them in advance, no instruction or
indication save perhaps for a line of children who suddenly moved
from the trees into the road. Then en masse the people swarmed
towards the coffin and its jeep-loads of head-scarved Jordanian
troops, tears streaming down their faces, hands outstretched to
touch, even to seize the flag or perhaps the coffin itself.
</P>
<P>
   I remember thinking, before a panicking soldier struck two men
with his rifle and punched me in the chest as the crowd fell on us
that it was like throwing petrol onto a kitchen stove.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strange, frightening kind of hysteria because it
combined both love and fury in almost exactly equal measure,
intense loyalty married to absolute rage.
</P>
<P>
   When I rolled over, I found the soldier lying beside me and
helped him to his feet. He shrugged as the crowd surged past him,
shouldered his rifle and walked after them in resignation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Teheran funeral of Ayatollah Khomeini, the crowds pulled
their Imam's body to the road and tore at his shroud. And if the
Arab Legion's descendants had not shouted in the name of their dead
king, and if the other soldiers had not laid into the first of the

   How, one wondered, did the mass outside feel about the large
presence of Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon in front of their
king's coffin, the very man who sent Israel's Lebanese Phalangist
allies into the Sabra and Chatila Palestinian refugee camps in 1982
to ``hunt down terrorists,'' militiamen who then proceeded to
murder _ Serb-style _ hundreds of Palestinian civilians?
</P>
<P>
   What did they think of the presence of Liamine Zeroual, the
outgoing president of Algeria whose security forces _ in their
battle against ``Islamic'' killers _ have been accused of
systematic torture of men and women?
</P>
<P>
   What did they make of the arrival of President Hafez Assad of
Syria, who ordered his soldiers to ``eliminate'' an Islamic
uprising at Hama in 1982, an operation that left the dead in their
thousands?

<P>
   Or of former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres, another of
Clinton's ``champions of peace,'' whose 1996 offensive against
Lebanon culminated in the Israeli massacre of 106 Lebanese
civilians in a U.N. camp at Qana?
</P>
<P>
   In every case, the victims had been Muslims, just as they had in
the war unleashed by the one man who most astonished the world by
turning up in Amman Monday and who may soon end up in a state
similar to the late King Hussein: Boris Yeltsin, whose butchery in

   There were a few intriguing moments. Clinton paused to talk
briefly to Assad before the Syrian leader took a car to the palace
mosque rather that walk behind the coffin with the others. He
didn't want, I suppose, to be seen with Sharon and Netanyahu and
Shamir.
</P>
<P>
   But few outside saw more than a glassed-over vision of the men

</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the pavement by a motorway bridge, the people of the

Arafat's frozen, sick features, a gaggle of robed Saudis in their
racing Mercedes, Prince Charles staring straight ahead as if

ridden again. &QL;

   AMMAN _ Two Jordans buried their king Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There was the formal, westernized nation with its Scottish-style
bagpipers and new, English-accented monarch who invited the world's
statesmen to bury the ``fallen warrior'' on his polished gun
carriage, Hussein's Arab steed _ empty boots reversed in the
stirrups _ clopping obediently behind the coffin.
</P>
<P>
   And what the world saw _ indeed, what the world was supposed to
see _ was the adoration of kings, presidents, prime ministers and
princes: Clinton, Bush, Blair, Assad, Yeltsin, Chirac, Charles,
Shamir, Netanyahu, Mubarak, Weizman, Arafat, Sharon, Carter,
Ford... After all, was this not the man whom the American president
had already consigned to paradise?
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the other Jordan. Outside the gate, sweating and
shrieking to God, smashed back by gun butts, sworn at by the
descendants of Glubb Pasha's Arab Legion as they clawed their way
towards King Hussein's coffin, the other Jordan didn't quite fit in
with the pageantry on the other side of the palace wall.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jordanians broke through the troops and charged in
their thousands towards the gates, they were confronted by hundreds
more armed soldiers. ``In the name of God, help me,'' an old woman
moaned as the crowd stamped her into the mud.
</P>
<P>
   So which was the real Jordan? Was it the nation enshrined just
above the marble floor of the Rhagadan Palace, where the coffin of
the king was honored, prayed to, watched and nodded at by all the
dangerous, untrustworthy allies who had variously loved, hated or
plotted against him?
</P>
<P>
   Such sincerity, such affection they all showed Monday. There was
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who sent his killer
squad into Jordan only a few months ago to assassinate a Hamas
official, bowing stiffly before the coffin.
</P>
<P>
   There was American ex-President George Bush who just eight years
ago regarded Hussein as little more than an enemy agent.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, whose gunmen once sought to
destroy Hussein's kingdom, snapped to attention in his olive
fatigues and kuffiah scarf, twice saluting the flag-draped wooden
box in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   And behind the coffin, scarcely moving, was the studied, often
frowning face of King Abdullah the Second and his two
half-brothers, Crown Prince Hamzeh and Prince Hashem.
</P>
<P>
   They stood there, hands out in prayer from time to time, all
dressed in immaculate suits and ties and all wearing the same kind
of checkered red-and-white kuffiah as Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   It was if they were acting out some kind of unusual ritual, more
like English public schoolboys in an unfamiliar play than Arab
warrior princes, trying to cut a dash among the tall men of the old
Arab Legion _ Hussein renamed them the Jordan Arab Army after he
dismissed Glubb _ who guarded the coffin and its royal standard.
</P>
<P>
   Vulnerable was the word that came to mind. The princes didn't
look old enough or hard enough or cynical enough to handle the
sleek men who passed before them to honor their father.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them gentlemen, others venal dictators, quite a few with
an awful lot of blood on their hands, the harmless and the harmful
one after the other, they paraded before the coffin as if waiting
for group passport pictures.

<P>
   AMMAN _ As the solemn procession of world leaders walked past
the body of King Hussein Monday, many of them must have remembered
they had attended a similar ceremony sixty miles away across the
Jordan River in Jerusalem just three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is an ominous precedent. In 1995 it was King Hussein himself
who was among the leading mourners to stand by the coffin of
Yitzhak Rabin, the assassinated Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Monday it was his turn to receive the same florid tributes from
President Clinton and the leaders of half the world as a
``visionary and peacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Television correspondents spoke piously of Jordan, as they had
of Israel, as ``a nation in mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   One Jordanian, noting the parallel between the two funerals,
said nervously that he hoped King Hussein's political legacy would
last longer than Rabin's.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after the death of their leader, Israelis chose
Benjamin Netanyahu, a man whom Rabin detested, to be their prime
minister. They voted even more decisively for a parliament which
opposed the peace terms with the Palestinians signed by Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   People in Jordan were flattered by the sight of President
Clinton and three former U.S. presidents arriving for the king's
funeral followed by Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president and the
leaders of half the world.
</P>
<P>
   They also noticed that in one of the most politically turbulent
regions of the world there was no threat to their safety. ``It is a
problem of logistics, not security,'' said one Jordanian official.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, however, Jordanians have an acute sense of
the vulnerability of their country.
</P>
<P>
   Though the television cameras zoomed in immediately on mourners
in tears as they lined the streets, the real mood of Jordan is of
anxiety about their future as much as grief for the dead king.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians understand that King Hussein never had much room to
maneuver. He ruled a small country surrounded by more powerful
neighbors. Nobody knew this better than himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was once asked why he had grown a beard. He replied: ``I grew
it because it is one of the few decisions I can take without having
to ask somebody else if it is OK to go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   His ceaseless diplomatic activity was at bottom a sign of
weakness. He needed to insert himself into every problem in the

through its own strength and prevent his country from becoming the
victim of events it could not control.
</P>
<P>
   His dilemma was the same as that of Yasser Arafat, though the
king escaped the Palestinian leader's reputation for
untrustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man ever had many political cards in his hand. Both
balanced uneasily between the needs of their own people and the
demands of outside powers. Both switched alliances repeatedly. They
cultivated the U.S. but tried to avoid becoming its pawn. Neither
was entirely successful.
</P>
<P>
   The king balanced between Arab nationalism and the need to
conciliate Israel and keep Washington friendly. It was ultimately a
defensive policy. He could not afford to take too many risks.
</P>
<P>
   He needed to ensure that Jordan was not cut out of negotiations
between Israel and the Palestinians, but not to the point where
Palestinians thought he was presenting himself as their sole
leader.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein's ambivalent policies were not only the result of
the ever-present threats facing Jordan from Israel, Iraq, Syria and
Saudi Arabia. The country itself is a buffer state created by
Britain after the First World War. Some 60 percent of its
population is of Palestinian origin.
</P>
<P>
   A survey carried out by the Center for Strategic Studies at the
University of Jordan several years ago shows that Palestinians
resent the control of most government jobs and all sensitive
military and security posts by citizens of Jordanian origin.
</P>
<P>
   They believe they are under-represented in the cabinet and
parliament and that the bureaucracy discriminates against them.
</P>
<P>
   For their part Jordanians resent Palestinian control of private
business. They fear more Palestinian refugees entering the country;
some 350,000 Palestinians expelled from Kuwait came to Jordan in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   They see Palestinians with Jordanian citizenship as ungrateful
and having dual loyalty to Jordan and the Palestinian leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan every change in its complicated relations with its
neighbors has the potential to create a crisis at home between the
two main groups in the country. &QL;

   There is a further problem. Television commentary Monday
stressed that King Hussein was much loved by his people. This is
true. But the commentators forbore to mention that the king's
popularity in Jordan was at its peak in 1991 when he maintained a
friendly neutrality towards Saddam Hussein and Iraq during the Gulf
war. Official policy and the popular mood were for once at one.
Democratization was at its height.
</P>
<P>
   It could not last. Jordan was diplomatically isolated.
Then-President George Bush would not even see his old friend King
Hussein. James Baker, the U.S. secretary of state, told the king:
``It's a tough row to hoe to repair Jordan's relationship with the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact it was repaired more quickly than he thought. The U.S.
needed Jordan to deal with Israel and the Palestinians. Jordan
moved back into U.S.-Israeli orbit.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994. A year
later he broke definitively with Saddam Hussein. He felt, rightly,
that he had no choice. But neither move was popular at home. The
treaty with Israel was commonly called ``the king's peace'' and
seen as an Arab defeat.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-Iraqi and pro-Israeli policy abroad meant less tolerance
of dissent at home. The king responded to riots in 1989 in the
Jordanian heartland in the south of the country by granting greater
freedom of expression and more democracy.
</P>
<P>
   From the mid-1990s these policies went into reverse. In the last
two years a stringent press law and government ownership of part of
the media has meant that Jordanians once again turn to foreign
radios and television for their information. &QL;

<P>
   AMMAN _ As the solemn procession of world leaders walked past
the body of King Hussein Monday, many of them must have remembered
they had attended a similar ceremony sixty miles away across the
Jordan River in Jerusalem just three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is an ominous precedent. In 1995 it was King Hussein himself
who was among the leading mourners to stand by the coffin of
Yitzhak Rabin, the assassinated Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Monday it was his turn to receive the same florid tributes from
President Clinton and the leaders of half the world as a
``visionary and peacemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Television correspondents spoke piously of Jordan, as they had
of Israel, as ``a nation in mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   One Jordanian, noting the parallel between the two funerals,
said nervously that he hoped King Hussein's political legacy would
last longer than Rabin's.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after the death of their leader, Israelis chose
Benjamin Netanyahu, a man whom Rabin detested, to be their prime
minister. They voted even more decisively for a parliament which
opposed the peace terms with the Palestinians signed by Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   People in Jordan were flattered by the sight of President
Clinton and three former U.S. presidents arriving for the king's
funeral followed by Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president and the
leaders of half the world.
</P>
<P>
   They also noticed that in one of the most politically turbulent
regions of the world there was no threat to their safety. ``It is a
problem of logistics, not security,'' said one Jordanian official.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, however, Jordanians have an acute sense of
the vulnerability of their country.
</P>
<P>
   Though the television cameras zoomed in immediately on mourners
in tears as they lined the streets, the real mood of Jordan is of
anxiety about their future as much as grief for the dead king.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians understand that King Hussein never had much room to
maneuver. He ruled a small country surrounded by more powerful
neighbors. Nobody knew this better than himself.
</P>
<P>
   He was once asked why he had grown a beard. He replied: ``I grew
it because it is one of the few decisions I can take without having
to ask somebody else if it is OK to go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   His ceaseless diplomatic activity was at bottom a sign of
weakness. He needed to insert himself into every problem in the
Middle East, win for Jordan an influence it could not command
through its own strength and prevent his country from becoming the
victim of events it could not control.
</P>
<P>
   His dilemma was the same as that of Yasser Arafat, though the
king escaped the Palestinian leader's reputation for
untrustworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man ever had many political cards in his hand. Both
balanced uneasily between the needs of their own people and the
demands of outside powers. Both switched alliances repeatedly. They

THIS TIME, A NOT-SO-SWEET PRINCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By B.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The members of the Frog and Peach Theater Company
have decided that ``Hamlet'' is pretty much a guy thing: a lethal
game between a young man and his stepfather who are out to destroy
each other and who end up obliterating their entire family, along
with another hapless family that just happened to be around.
Turning the play into a thriller of this kind requires very
different pacing from the usual classical productions and a marked
change in the personalities of some key characters.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing tentative about the Hamlet (Ted Zurkowski) in
this presentation; he has never heard of psychology, not to mention
psychiatry. He is all outside and very little inside, not much
given to introspection; his ``too too solid flesh'' speech is a
comment on his efforts to wipe his fingers clean after a handshake
with Claudius, and ``to be or not to be'' is spoken as a kind of
challenging flirtation to Ophelia. He hates Claudius and means to
kill him from word one; if it takes a little time, that is only
because Hamlet is gathering evidence of his stepfather's crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Claudius (Austin Pendleton), on the other hand, is all inside
and so little outside that courtiers walk right past him at the
outset, scarcely noticing he is there. But he is there, all right.
At first Pendleton makes it seem that Claudius hardly knows what to
say; he stops in mid-line to think about it.
</P>
<P>
   But in time this thoughtful caution becomes a calculating
menace. This Claudius is devious down to his toenails, and thus his
prayer scene is more convincing than in any performance I can
recall, ending as it does with his recognition that nothing can
stop him now, since he is damned anyway. And anyone who has ever
wondered what Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are doing in this play
need only watch Pendleton's crinkly-eyed self-satisfaction as he
manipulates them to realize what pawns of evil they are.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to cast Pendleton as the ghost of Hamlet's father
as well is rather ingenious. There is the advantage of the obvious
resemblance of the brothers. But more to the point, as the scheming
Claudius occasionally makes himself almost invisible to other
characters, the ghost is a commanding presence no one can ignore,
not even those who can't see him.
</P>
<P>
   Lynnea Benson, the director, makes this very much a domestic
drama by the simple device of staging virtually every one-on-one
confrontation out of sight and earshot of other characters. The
discrete, almost secret development of the crisis brought on by the
enmity of Hamlet and Claudius has a claustrophobic feeling that
fits the conception of the play as a thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Making Hamlet so brawny has telling effects on Horatio and
Laertes. Horatio (Joe Corey) is a kind of crumpled good old boy who
turns up when needed, and this notion works quite well until the
end, when ``good night, sweet prince'' sounds peculiarly soppy in
his mouth. For Laertes (Matthew D. Barton), the toughening of
Hamlet levels the field. When Hamlet is a brooding intellectual,
Laertes always seems just a youthful victim. Here Hamlet is no
smarter than Laertes, and Laertes' plotting with Claudius to poison
Hamlet makes both young men seekers of blood vengeance fated to
kill each other.
</P>
<P>
   And what happens to the women, Gertrude and Ophelia, roles so
appealing that directors almost always spotlight them? Ophelia
(Josephine Gallarello) does in fact seem a bit lost, just a nice
girl who walked into the wrong place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   Gertrude (Vivien Landau) is something else. First, she is so
definite about her opinions and perceptions that she seems at times
almost to prop up the worried and ingrown Claudius. And that makes
what happens when Hamlet examines her conscience in her bedroom
especially striking; she looks absolutely terrified, so much so
that when the ghost tells Hamlet she is shaken, you wonder how he
thinks anyone could miss it. Besides all that, Ms. Landau's sense
of poise and style keeps making you wonder whether Wallace Warfield
Simpson might not have looked like this if she had ever been
allowed to run Buckingham Palace.
</P>
<P>
   There are some unfortunate moments in this production and some
creaky transitions. But the determination of Ms. Benson and the
cast to realize all the implications of their overall conception of
the play makes it a very different and thought-provoking experience
of ``Hamlet.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It has not gone as UCLA freshman forward JaRon
Rush planned, not even close. He was homesick in December. He was
too scared to fly in January. Last weekend he was booted from
practice and benched for the Oregon State game. His jumper arrived
just recently.
</P>
<P>
   Examine Rush through the lens of Los Angeles and his
vulnerabilities seem incongruous with his big, bad reputation and a
resume that includes a public feud with Kansas coach Roy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   But the key to unlocking his present is a past that tugs at him
from his native Kansas City, where he is both exploited and
glorified, where a circle of friends, family and hangers-on have
made him both the center of their universe and an outsider, filled
with contradictions and insecurities, trying to please others while
being true to himself.
</P>
<P>
   For Rush, college is a reclamation project, and the subject is
his soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I feel like my life is everybody else's,'' he said.
``Sometimes, I feel like it it's not my mind, it's theirs.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
__ Early and often &QL; 
Rush was cursed by being too good too young. In 1994, when Hoop
Scoop Magazine annointed him the best player in the high school
freshman class, his life disappeared. Coaches, boosters and
recruiters saw Rush as a meal ticket and scrambled for a piece of
the 15-year-old. (By contrast, Baron Davis was 5-foot-3 and unknown
as a ninth grader.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Late-bloomers have it easier,'' Rush said. ``I've always been
in the spotlight and it's not much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush was Kansas City's version of L.A. phenom Schea Cotton. He
became immersed in expectations and attention. Every game was a
story, his recruitment a public saga and, even now, Rush makes
headlines in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   When he did not play Sunday against Oregon State, it was on the
front page of the Kansas City Star's sports section and a topic of
conversation on sports radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big celebrity back there,'' said UCLA guard Earl
Watson, a Kansas City, Kan., native. ``Anthony Peeler saved
basketball in Kansas City. JaRon was supposed to be the next
Peeler.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush's inner circle expanded with his fame. He had four homes,
five families and a slew of sycophants. It was a fantastic,
fractured world _ cars and trips for free, seductive yet
smothering, overpowering his core, vanquishing his sense of self.
</P>
<P>
   ``JaRon feels he has to please too many people,'' said Rush's
cousin, Tyrone Jacobs. ``A lot of people have tried to influence
him.''
</P>
<P>
   There is Tom Grant, the Kansas booster who became Rush's
benefactor, offering his house and car, funding a scholarship at
Pembroke Hill School and flying Rush around the country to visit
colleges. (The NCAA approved the Rush-Grant relationship,
concluding Grant was not acting on Kansas' behalf and has assisted
other prep athletes.)
</P>
<P>
   There's Myron Piggie, the former AAU coach who commanded a
stable of prep stars that included Watson. Through Grant, Piggie
gained early influence with Rush and eventually orchestrated his
recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   There's his girlfriend, Sarah Hofstra, the mother of his
14-month-old son, Shea. And Hofstra's parents. There's his mother
Glenda and his brother Kareem, himself a well-regarded prospect who
might sign with UCLA. Finally, Rush has his grandmother, Jeanette
Jacobs, whom he trusts above all, who sees through the presents,
the promises and the posturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When JaRon's (in Kansas City), he has people giving him what
he wants because they all want a piece of him,'' Jeanette said.
``It's been giving and giving. The Grants taking him on trips has
done this to him. He hasn't been able to live his own life.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to choose a college, Grant and the Hofstras
wanted Kansas, Jeanette and Glenda did not. They saw the pressure
and the pampering and realized Rush could not be a Jayhawk if he
wanted a life. Glenda refused to co-sign the letter of intent, Rush
criticized Kansas coach Roy Williams' substitution pattern and,
with a city outraged, committed to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been great theater if it hadn't been his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's always telling him what he should do, what he
shouldn't do, where he should go to school, where he shouldn't go
to school,'' Jeanette said. ``I got tired of it. The best thing was
for him to go to California and be his own boss. He needs a life,
and if he stayed here he wouldn't have it.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
__ The price of fame &QL; 
Rush was never more vulnerable than on the frightening flight to
the Louisville game. Trembling, crying, he put his head on Watson's
lap and prayed for his life, then refused to board the connecting
flight and drove from Memphis to Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not the only instance of insecurity. Throughout the
season _ in Puerto Rico and Eugene, Ore., against Kentucky and
against Stanford _ Rush has talked of nerves. His honesty is
refreshing, his problem mystifying: How can one of the nation's top
prep players be nervous, and not just once or twice, but for 15
games? The answer is in Kansas City, ground zero for pressure and
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   His Christmas break was a perfect example. He spent time with
Grant and with his friends and his family and with Piggie, who
tried to regain lost influence and, a source said, pressured Rush
into not returning to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Piggie is just another voice,'' Rush said. ``He has tried to
take advantage of me financially.'' (Piggie could not be reached
for comment.)
</P>
<P>
   Rush also spent time with Shea _ gave him a bitty basketball set
for Christmas _ and with Sarah. Her parents suggested a transfer so
he could be closer to home, closer to his son.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere he went, every house he entered, someone had an
opinion. After five months away, he was once again at the center of
attention, people tugging at him from all directions. He wasn't so
much homesick as home-obligated. But what they really wanted,
everyone except Jeanette, was what was best for them. Deep down, he
knew he had to leave. It was just so hard to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   He returned a few days late, served a one-game suspension, then
returned to his internal war with nerves and expectations. His jump
shot arrived Feb. 4, with a 6-of-9 performance against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, he was kicked out of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was out of character and that's why I threw him out,'' UCLA
coach Steve Lavin said. ``Because he's finding a way to cope with
the pressure and the homesickness and having so much on his plate,
maybe being silly is a way to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rush walked out of Pauley Pavilion, picked up the telephone and
dialed Jeanette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he needs to grow up a little,'' she said. ``Being
here, where people give him things, that's not the real world. I'm
trying to keep him out there, in the real world. I'm doing
everything I can. He's just been under tremendous pressure. I'm
surprised he hasn't gone bonkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does the saga end? Will Rush wilt under the pressure and
return to his Kansas City comfort zone? Or will he endure the
distance and forge his own life in L.A.? Watson, who battled
homesickness last year, believes Rush will be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year, he'll be fine, just like I am now,'' Watson said.
``It's a long road. It definitely takes a year, but he'll mature.''
</P>
<P>
   Out here, at least, he has a chance.

 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
SALT LAKE CITY _ The printed report, with copious footnotes and
appendixes, was as thick as a phone book, but there was little
trouble cutting to the chase. After an investigation covering
nearly eight weeks and involving some 50,000 pages of documents, a
look into the inner dealings of the Salt Lake Bid Committee's
efforts to land the 2002 Winter Olympic Games yielded one
inescapable conclusion.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's largely a world without rules,'' David Jordan, a member
of the five-person Board of Ethics charged with investigating a
process gone badly wrong, said Tuesday. ``Some function well in a
world without rules. Some don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a roomful of national and world media, Jordan and his
group shed a little more embarrassing light on some of those who
don't, implicating 10 more International Olympic Committee members
in the growing bribery scandal, bringing the grand total to 24.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations include cash payments, a bogus scholarship
program, expensive travel (including Super Bowl trips), medical
services, gifts and shopping sprees _ even a suspect deal involving
the United States Olympic Committee and an agreement to provide
training and support for Sudanese athletes.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the board blamed the largest scandal in
Olympics history on two men _ former Salt Lake Organizing Committee
head Tom Welch and his top lieutenant, Dave Johnson. SLOC chairman
Robert Garff went so far as to describe the behavior of the two as
``disgusting and disguised.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of things, though, it became clear there was
plenty of dirt to go around, much of it involving sticky-fingered
IOC delegates and relatives who were more than willing to accept
SLOC cash and favors. According to the report, ``the behavior of
some IOC members was eye-opening as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The board's findings also cast aspersions on the USOC's efforts
on behalf of Sudanese athletes in citing electronic mail from
former USOC official Alfredo LaMont, who wrote that ``a lot of
promises were made to secure votes.'' LaMont also is linked to a
pair of questionable consulting deals with ties to African Olympic
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding hints that the support had been linked to votes, USOC
executive director Dick Schultz noted that the organization
commonly gives aid to foreign athletes and insisted there had been
no wrongdoing on the organization's part.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to help Salt Lake,'' he said. ``There was no
attempt to buy votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the board painted a picture of a bid committee allowed
to run amok after the unsuccessful 1991 bid for the 1998 Winter
Games, which went to Nagano, Japan. While concluding that Welch and
Johnson were under a mandate to secure the Games for 2002 after
what several of those interviewed called ``more sophisticated and
extravagant'' efforts by the rival Japanese, Garff lamented that
the quest clearly had gotten out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was not part of the plan,'' he said, ``was Mr. Welch and
Mr. Johnson making direct payments to IOC members.''
</P>
<P>
   Those included more than $70,000 in cash to Jean-Claude Ganga,
part of an estimated $250,000 in benefits the Republic of Congo
native allegedly received. They also involved questionable
employment arrangements for relatives of IOC members and a
``scholarship program'' that often was nothing more than a front
for cash payments.
</P>
<P>
   Benefits included a Super Bowl trip (cost: $19,991) for three
couples with IOC ties, including Australian member Phillip Coles
and Guatemalan Willi Kaltschmitt, each of them newly linked to the
Salt Lake end of the scandal. Others were treated to trips to New
York City, Las Vegas and Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   The board stressed, however, that it could find no evidence of
rumored ``escort'' services for IOC visitors, a subject of
considerable local gossip in recent weeks and months.
</P>
<P>
   While the group lacked subpoena power, and some subjects _
notably former SLOC finance chief Craig Peterson and one-time Welch
secretary Stephanie Pate _ declined to cooperate, the report
offered more detail than the IOC investigation and drew more of its
membership into the web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand there is a great amount of detail in this,'' IOC
vice president Dick Pound, head of the organization's own
investigation, said in a conference call with reporters. ``This
will certainly supplement what we've been able to find, and I hope
it will fill in some of the gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights:
</P>
<P>
   SLOC's now-famous ``scholarship program'' was fertile and common
ground for abuse. Among the more blatant examples: $23,000 in
living expenses for Nancy Rignault Arroyo, 44-year-old divorced
daughter of Ecuadorean IOC member Augustin Arroyo.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga, among six IOC members facing expulsion in the wake of the
scandal, accepted about $250 million in medical care, gifts,
travel, lodging and cash while making at least a half-dozen visits
to Salt Lake City during the bid process.
</P>
<P>
   The report estimated travel expenses alone for Ganga and his
family in excess of $115,000, plus $13,900 in meals and lodging.
Other benefits included an additional $45,000 in either paid or
donated medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Ganga and his wife commonly ran up big bills on
bid-committee-sponsored shopping trips while in town. Between Oct.
25, 1994, and March 27, 1995, the bid committee also provided what
the report termed ``unexplained direct payments'' to Ganga totaling
$70,010.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Mukora, an IOC delegate from Kenya, received direct
payments totaling $34,650 between Nov. 26, 1993, and May 5, 1995.
Welch told the Board of Ethics that all but the first payment of
$5,200 was for Mukora's personal use.
</P>
<P>
   Chilean IOC member Sergio Santander-Fantini, president of his
country's National Olympic Committee during the time of Salt Lake's
bid for the 2002 Games, received two checks totaling $20,050,
believed to have been used for a political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in December 1994, the bid committee authorized four
$15,000 payments to Rene Essomba, the since-deceased IOC member
from Cameroon. It also spent $108,350 on tuition and living
expenses for Essomba's daughter, Sonia Essomba, and provided legal
advice in her efforts to break an apartment lease.
</P>
<P>
   The bid committee arranged for the daughter of Dr. Un Yong Kim,
the IOC member from Korea, to perform with the Utah Symphony on
March 24 and 25, 1995. Pianist Hae Jung Kim received $5,000 for her
appearance. Welch also helped John Kim, the IOC member's son, to
find consulting work at a local communications company, with the
bid committee paying at least $45,000 of the younger Kim's salary
and perhaps as much as $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bjarne Haeggman, then-husband of Finnish IOC member Pirje
Haeggman, received $33,750 for a consulting job with Great Basin
Engineering of Ogden.
</P>
<P>
   LaMont, the recently resigned director of international
relations and protocol for the USOC, was linked to a pair of
questionable consulting deals. In the course of the successful 2002
effort, the bid committee paid more than $18,000 to Arca Inc., to
which LaMont has been tied.
</P>
<P>
   Among fresh names undergoing scrutiny, Mohamed Zerguini of
Algeria reportedly was involved in securing a cash payment of
$14,500 for a grandson through consultant El Farnawani of Toronto;
$3,000 a month was found to pass through a consulting firm linked
to Austin Sealy of Barbados; and three others (Rampaul Ruhee of
Mauritius, Anani Matthia of Togo and Ashwini Kumar of India)
allegedly accepted trips for wives or family to attend the 1995
site election in Budapest, where Salt Lake City finally got the
call.
</P>
<P>
   While Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt lauded the report as the first step
in ``moving on,'' initial response elsewhere was less enthusiastic:
The John Hancock Co., a major Olympic sponsor, canceled
negotiations with NBC for $20 million in advertising to protest the
IOC's handling of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, meanwhile, officials hoped the disclosures would begin
to shift the focus to the Games, which now are less than three
years away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what happened here wasn't right, and we're setting it
right,'' Leavitt said. ``Olympic corruption didn't start here, but
it must end here.''

TIME TO CUT MARINERS SOME PRESEASON SLACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For months, or rather, for more than a year, the
favorite game in town has been ``Pin the Tail on the Mariners.''
</P>
<P>
   Rancor. Mistrust. Skepticism. Ridicule. You name it, the
Mariners have been dealt it.
</P>
<P>
   From John Ellis' crying game about the new stadium to Chuck
Armstrong's announcement in November '97 about no deal for Randy
Johnson to Glenallen Hill's beanball tactics in left field to Russ
Davis' bloopers, bleeps and blunders at third base to Bobby Ayala
and Heathcliff Slocumb's gas-house bullpen gang all the way down to
Woody Woodward's giving away the Mariner farm in trading-deadline
giveaways . . . no stone has been left unturned, no stone has been
left unthrown.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday marked the start of a kinder, gentler view of our
little M's.
</P>
<P>
   Until further notice, i.e. until the Mariners are 10 games out
of first place in the AL West (OK, maybe eight games out), this
columnist is not going to assume _ even in the face of substantial
evidence _ that the M's don't have a clue about what they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: In major league baseball, three days are reserved
for unabashed optimism.
</P>
<P>
   One is the first day of spring training, with that mind-altering
first brush with sunlight and the sweet, hypnotic THWACK sound of
batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   The other is Opening Day, when the standings list every team as
being equal and the butterflies and excitement are palpable, from
the fans in the 300 level down to the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Third, if your home team is the Mariners, the other day for a
Pollyanna-ish demeanor is the team's annual Prespring Training
Luncheon at the Edgewater Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere else in the presence of a rubberized, vaguely edible
chicken fillet (not that we're complaining) can so much skepticism
be throttled by a such a gush of open-mindedness and good humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be positive and brief,'' Ellis said. ``You always have
such optimism this time of year. Any baseball fan does.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something very homey and nice about the Mariners'
prespring training gathering. The Pepsi people show up. The Compaq
computer guy is there. The KIRO gang, including broadcaster Dave
Niehaus, turns out.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward was on hand, too, pleasantly answering all the
questions about players and the minor league ranks and deals he
would have liked to have made, if money had been no object this
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way salaries took off, there was no way I can justify
spending that kind of money without wondering if it's good for
baseball,'' Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we could have, we would have gone after Tim Belcher or
Todd Stottlemyre, two veteran pitchers who would have been a
welcome addition to any club.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, the M's did nothing to get a front-line pitcher, thanks to
the Microsoft and Nintendo millionaires who can't spend any more
money. (Hey, it's their money.)
</P>
<P>
   Just for being honest, Woodward made it hard to secretly crucify
him for trading away two or three players in deadline deals when
the other team was only expecting one or two Mariner prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was Lou Piniella's turn at the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella always comes in from Tampa with a nice tan, which
really helps freshen up this gray, wintry place. And this time,
Piniella looked rested, ready and, best of all, miraculously devoid
of that ``I am definitely going to kill someone'' look he exuded
throughout 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this, we were all disappointed with last year's
record,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sometimes, I think you can take winning for granted. What
happened last year has made me more determined. We might be picked
third in our division, which is to be expected. But I'll tell you
one thing, we're not going to finish third. We're going to finish
on top.''
</P>
<P>
   On such a day as this, you had to believe Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   When he starts slinging around the fact that he still has Alex
Rodriguez, Jay Buhner, David Segui, Edgar Martinez, Dan Wilson and
Ken Griffey Jr., it's hard to focus on the fact that Jamie Moyer,
Jeff Fassero and Billy Swift (three-fifths of the Mariners'
starting rotation) are nearly as old as the Kennewick Man.
</P>
<P>
   The point is, Piniella has had a change of attitude, which _
Mariner players beware _ will translate into a killer spring
training regime.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, head trainer Rick Griffin speculated drills would be
longer and harder, like in the old days, when ``five or six guys
vomited'' during a workout.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the past two seasons, instead of walking into spring
training thinking World Series, the M's won't forget the
embarrassment of '98 and will have to work their butts off to stay
competitive. The Angels and Rangers will share top billing in the
West, even though the M's own those two teams, and not just
psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   A team with this sort of work ethic and mind-set is tough to
harp on.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, after vilifying the Mariners for A) Everything
(stadium costs, Randy Johnson debacle, the unwillingness to wade
into the sky-high free-agent market) and B) Anything (when will
Griffey and Rodriguez be locked up?), it suddenly dawns on you:
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, just maybe, it's time to back off pummeling the good old
M's.
</P>

JAZZ TUNES IN FOR 4TH QUARTER, TOPS MAVERICKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ This time the Mavericks did not have enough gas left in
their tanks to force overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Employing a defense that suffocated the Mavericks in the fourth
quarter, the Utah Jazz erased an 11-point, second-quarter deficit
and spoiled the Mavericks' home opener with a 90-79 victory before
a fired-up crowd of 17,070 last night at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   In the frantic fourth quarter _ which started tied at 66 _ the
Mavericks made only 1 of 12 shots and committed eight turnovers
that led to 10 points for the Jazz (3-0).
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a real good job for three quarters,'' Mavericks
coach/general manager Don Nelson said. ``They just turned it up in
the fourth quarter and outplayed us, and that's what great teams
are supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not discouraged. We did some good things. We just weren't
clicking on all of our cylinders.''
</P>
<P>
   In the somber Mavericks locker room, rookie Dirk Nowitzki drew a
large crowd after his 15-point, nine-rebound effort. Two stalls
over, point guard Steve Nash was taking the loss personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as though I let the team down,'' said Nash, who was
1-of-9 from the field and scored only four points. ``If I would
have shot the ball better, we would have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone had nine of his game-high 31 points in the fourth
quarter. Malone scored seven consecutive points, and, combined with
John Stockton, helped the Jazz ease ahead, 85-77, with 2:26
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton finished with 12 points and five assists. Malone added
12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're the favorites because they were there last
year and took the best team in the NBA to the wire,'' said Cedric
Ceballos, who led the Mavericks with 19 points. ``They're real
competitive, they play at a high level, and they've got two great
players that really carry that ballclub and get them out of almost
any kind of danger that they get into.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks had put the Jazz in a lot of danger in the second
quarter. Dallas led, 39-28, after two baskets by Samaki Walker
midway through the second period.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone, who had 16 points in the first half, helped Utah
close to within 45-41 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pack, the Mavericks' backup point guard, scored nine
points in the third period. He highlighted the quarter when he
split the Utah defense, scored on a reverse layup, was fouled, and
completed the three-point play that sent the two teams into the
fourth quarter tied at 66.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fourth period the Jazz turned up the heat, and the
Mavericks couldn't hold onto the ball or make a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome left Michael Finley, who scored 15 points on 6-of-15
shooting, shaking his head in disbelief. But he said the Jazz
should be given credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to put them up there, being that they're the
\Rtwo-time\S defending Western Conference champions, being that
they went to other arenas and won,'' Finley said. ``They're a
veteran crew, and until someone dethrones them they're the team to
beat in the West.''

MAVS HAVE NO ANSWER FOR MALONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It began with the lights off and Mavs Man suspended
upside down from the ceiling like some malevolent vampire last
night at Reunion Arena. If Don Nelson could somehow have arranged
to have him dropped on Karl Malone, maybe the Mavs would have had a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was ``The Mailman'' who drained everything in sight
and even gave the Mavs' head coach a forearm shiver to remember him
by as the Jazz spoiled the Mavs' home opener with a 90-79 victory
in front of a near sellout crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he hits you, you remember it,'' Nellie laughed afterward
of the psychological battle with Malone that actually turned
physical late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me a little bump,'' Nelson confirmed of the forearm
Malone smacked into the coach's shoulder as he came by the sideline
at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Busy trying to hold his unraveling team together at the time,
Nellie barely reacted to Malone's hit. Malone looked back over his
shoulder as he loped down court, watching Nelson for a response
that never really came.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took that pretty good for an older fella,'' Malone chuckled
as he soaked his feet in a bucket of ice following Utah's third
consecutive victory to start the season.
</P>
<P>
   If the distracted Nelson was an easy target, the Mavs were like
tin cans in a shooting gallery. Malone drilled them for 31 points
and a dozen rebounds. Sitting at courtside, it felt more like 60
and 25.
</P>
<P>
   The stats sheet says Malone made 14 of 22 shots. Funny, I don't
remember him missing a thing, including Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never easy, but you get into a kind of rhythm in some
games and it feels like every shot you take is going in,'' Malone
said. ``They went small in the fourth quarter and I just tried to
exploit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Exploit it? Watching Malone toy with the Mavs was like watching
Gulliver playing H-O-R-S-E with the Lilliputians. At any moment you
can expect word from Reunion Arena that Malone has scored again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were giving him the jump shot and he was hitting it,''
Nelson conceded.
</P>
<P>
   One question: What kind of brilliant defensive strategy
``gives'' Malone the jump shot?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe giving Malone his jumpers wasn't in the game
plan. Maybe it's just what Malone took from hapless defenders like
A.C. Green, Hot Rod Williams and Cedric Ceballos.
</P>
<P>
   The warm, fuzzy feelings left over from the Mavs' 45-41 halftime
lead had pretty well dissipated by the time the fourth quarter
began. Everyone in Reunion realized that the Jazz was just getting
warmed up while the Mavs seemed to be falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz turned up the intensity in the fourth quarter and the
Mavs couldn't match it. Veteran point guard John Stockton simply
wouldn't let the Mavs get anything going offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sniffed our poor passers out and gummed about five
possessions up,'' Nelson said. ``We're not ready to beat this team
yet. But I did think I could put a team out there that could score
more than 79 points. You shoot only 35 percent from the field, it's
going to be hard to beat anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially the defending Western Conference champion Jazz, the
team many figure will supplant the Bulls as this year's NBA champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a veteran team and we're supposed to win that game,''
Malone said. ``They have a young team over there but they're
talented and everybody wants to beat the Jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Nelson was trying to throw Malone off his game when he
said something to him in the first half last night. Malone did a
double-take, stared at the Dallas coach and then began to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not important what I said,'' Nelson said with a smile.
``I've loved the guy so much over the years and have so much
respect for him. I was just having a little fun with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone seemed to enjoy the give-and-take.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't say anything bad, but I'm not going to repeat it,''
Malone said, also grinning. ``I like having fun with him. There
aren't a lot of coaches around who'd do something like that and I
enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's because ``The Mailman,'' as usual, got in the last
and best shot. In more ways than one.

AXELSSON, BRUINS TOO SLICK FOR OILERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta _ His nickname is Gumby because of the way he
bounces off checks from bigger, stronger players. His blond hair,
impish grin, stick-thin frame, and perennial good mood make him the
target of good-natured ribbing from his Bruins teammates.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have great offensive gifts and has been known to miss
the net a time or two. But his determination and chemistry on
Boston's top defensive line earned him a regular job last season as
a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night P.J. Axelsson played the role of hero as he broke
a scoreless tie with a goal at 5:30 of the third period, propelling
Boston to a 2-0 victory over the Edmonton Oilers at the Skyreach
Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Anson Carter, playing for the first time since spraining his
ankle Jan. 2 against Anaheim, scored the insurance goal when he
teed up a slapper from the right point at 10:07.
</P>
<P>
   Boston goalie Byron Dafoe stopped 31 Edmonton shots to register
the shutout, his sixth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The win, in the opener of a three-game road trip, extended
Boston's unbeaten streak to three games (2-0-1).
</P>
<P>
   Axelsson drove down the right circle, shook off an attempted
mugging by defenseman Janne Niinimaa, and beat Mikhail Shtalenkov
into the top right corner. It was Axelsson's sixth goal of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw that I had a step on the defense, so I tried to go
around him,'' said Axelsson. ``He missed the hit on me, so I tried
to go to the net and he grabbed my jersey, so I just had to throw
the shot away and it went in. It was a little bit of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston found itself outmanned in a scoreless first period when
it lost two players. At 15:10, Darren Van Impe suffered a shoulder
separation when he was crushed by Georges Laraque after moving the
puck out from behind his net.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins also lost forward Peter Ferraro late in the period
with a foot contusion.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns said Van Impe will fly home to Boston  &UR; today &LR; ,
and Ferraro's foot isn't broken but is very swollen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had five guys left on defense,'' said Burns, ``and of the
five, three of their ages probably add up to over 100. They hung in
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good effort. We lost some soldiers along the way but
we battled strong. It didn't faze us. We hung in there and played a
patient game, and that's our strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter wasn't supposed to be back until Friday, but because of
his progress and the aid of a cortisone shot last Friday, he suited
up.
</P>
<P>
   After missing so much time _ first because of a contract dispute
and then the injury _ Carter had played only 25 games this season,
less than half of the schedule. The rust showed. It seemed that
both his conditioning and timing were off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous,'' said Carter. ``You never know how you're
going to react after being out for a month. It felt good to be
sitting on the bench and in the heat of battle again. My timing is
a little bit off, but my legs were fine.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle period, Boston got a huge scare at 11:16 when
Dafoe was crushed by former Boston University star Mike Grier. The
Bruins were on the power play and the puck got by Ray Bourque at
the point. Grier poked it ahead and started chasing it down. Dafoe
came rushing out of the net up through the left circle, and after
he cleared the puck, Grier ran right into him, hitting the
netminder in the head and sending him sprawling.
</P>
<P>
   After several seconds, Dafoe shook it off and remained in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' top line of Jason Allison, Sergei Samsonov, and
Dmitri Khristich turned in a good effort during a power play midway
through the second but couldn't get anything past Shtalenkov.

CELTICS END HEAT'S DOMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The cameras were on Antoine Walker, Paul Pierce, and
Rick Pitino. They were saying some nice things about their 108-101
win over the Heat at Miami Arena Tuesday night. They were measured
in their remarks. Kenny Anderson was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, man,'' the point guard announced near the entrance of the
locker room, ``this is a new era for the Celtics. This is the
Pitino Era. We're about to play some ball here.''
</P>
<P>
   The point guard was just getting started. He had heard that the
Celtics hadn't defeated the Heat since February 1996. Walker and
Pierce were in college then. Pitino was coaching Walker at the
University of Kentucky. And the Celtics were, well, a joke.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the past, man,'' Anderson said. ``I hope teams
understand they are playing the Boston Celtics. We are not the
rebuilding Boston Celtics. When we're on our game, we can do some
damage. Look at the Pitino Era. We're not going to be blown out by
teams. Do teams know that? If they don't, they better ask
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, if teams don't know, they can ask Pat Riley. The Miami
coach was not in a good mood before the game. He stood against a
wall and spoke in a near whisper when discussing the status of
starting small forward Jamal Mashburn. Mashburn did not play
Tuesday night. Neither did Voshon Lenard. The Heat have major
problems and the Celtics made them feel worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 2 1/2 years since we've had this kind of a feeling
and doubt,'' Riley said of his team. It's also been that long since
the Celtics walked into this arena and beat the Heat. They had lost
nine consecutive games against Miami. But then, this is the first
time the Heat had to look at the trio of Walker, Pierce, and
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was dominant, scoring 31 points and securing 10 rebounds.
Pierce had his third 19-point game of the season, excited the crowd
of 15,200 with two terrific dunks, rejected a Dan Majerle attempt
off the backboard to begin a fast break, and had 7 rebounds. And
while Anderson made only 4 of 14 shots, he was perfect from the
line (14 for 14), managed 22 points, and had 7 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done a thing yet,'' the veteran said. ``We got some
guys here. We've got the Rook (Pierce). We've got a young star in
Antoine. Popeye Jones. Dana (Barros) off the bench . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Every pro basketball fan in South Florida knows that now. They
know because the Celtics would not go away, even after shooting 25
percent in the first quarter and 33 percent in the first half. They
trailed only 46-45 after all that missing, not a good sign for the
Heat. Many teams understand that when you are playing a Riley team
of the 1990s, you don't necessarily have to shoot well to win. All
you have to do is be willing to take bruises and deliver some of
your own. So take a look at the box score this morning. You will
notice that the Celtics shot 41 percent and won.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, this matchup was destined for a close finish.
Never mind that the Celtics went ahead, 80-70, on a Pierce dunk in
the fourth quarter. Anyone in tune with the game's flow could sense
that neither team would be able to shake the other.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of drama, too. Both coaches were upset with the
uneven calls of Ronnie Nunn. And the man responsible for blowing
the horn at the official scorer's table seemed to have something
against the home team. Twice he blew the horn as Heat players were
taking free throws. The last time he did it, Alonzo Mourning (14
points, 9 rebounds) turned to the table and yelled, ``Would you
stop that (expletive)?''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' night was full of quirks, too. They went through an
awful 4 1/2-minute stretch in the third quarter in which they were
outscored, 14-0. You would think that drought would have lost the
game for them, but they ended the quarter ahead, 71-66. When they
struggled with their offense midway through the fourth quarter,
they got a 3-pointer from Bruce Bowen _ known for his defense _ to
put them up, 85-78. They also survived a second-quarter scare in
which Walker asked out of the game. He was experiencing back pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just some spasms,'' Walker said. ``I'm not about to let that
keep me out of a game. This win was just so big for us. We've got a
long break coming up, so you don't want to go into that with a 1-3
record. Now we're .500 and have some time to get our guys (Ron
Mercer, Walter McCarty) back.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino said he wasn't necessarily excited about beating Miami.
``We're not looking at who we beat, we're looking at the victory.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what he said. But you could sense this was something
special for Pitino. It was his first win over Miami. And it is the
first time in years that if Miami looks at the Atlantic Division
standings, it sees itself below Boston.

UCONN WOMEN GET EVEN WITH BOSTON COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLLEGE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD _ All week, maybe longer, the Huskies have been talking
about revenge against Boston College, payback for the upset loss at
Conte Forum last month. That long, dismal afternoon was an
embarrassment they had no intention of reliving in their rematch
Tuesday night, and they didn't care who knew it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most furious Husky was fiery guard Shea Ralph, who
in January could only watch dejectedly from the sideline with a
knee injury as her University of Connecticut teammates came out
flat, foundering, and fizzling their way to a rare Big East loss.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night the sophomore started her first game and turned in
a career-high 36 points (83 percent shooting) in leading the
Huskies to a crushing 107-77 win over BC before 16,294 satisfied
fans in the Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, fourth-ranked UConn improved to 21-3 overall, 14-1
in the league, while BC fell to 17-6 and 9-6. It was the third
straight loss for the Eagles, who have faced three Top 12 teams in
a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight's just another night,'' said Ralph, grinning while
trying to shrug off her 10-for-12 shooting effort, including 4 for
5 from beyond the 3-point arc and 12 for 12 from the line. ``It's a
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Her teammates were more effusive. ``She's so aggressive,''
explained Marci Glenney, who played 22 minutes off the bench. ``You
know she has games like that inside of her just waiting to come
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Alissa Murphy, who scored a career-high 32 points in BC's 78-66
upset of the Huskies, fouled out with 10:27 left after scoring 18
points to share the Eagles' scoring lead with backcourt mate
Brianne Stepherson. Becky Gottstein (5 points) soon joined Murphy
as the Eagles were in foul trouble early in a game in which 53
fouls were called.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating,'' said Murphy, who was called for three
fouls in less than a minute midway through the second half. ``I
don't know what else to say about that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier meeting, UConn appeared hesitant, flat from the
outset. Not this time. Ralph hinted at things to come when she hit
a 3-pointer to open the scoring, and the outcome, for all intents
and purposes, seemed decided by halftime, even though UConn led by
only 14, 58-44.
</P>
<P>
   There were some bright spots for the Eagles, who coach Cathy
Inglese said were not at all nervous coming back to face a team
that had beaten them 16 straight times before last month's stunner.
One was freshman forward Nicole Conway, who had a career-high 14
points. After UConn jumped out to a 16-8 lead, the Eagles fought
back (thanks in large part to a couple of Conway 3-pointers) to
within 2 points, 20-18, with 12:30 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   But the Huskies put together runs of 15-6 and 11-2 on the way to
their halftime lead, earned largely on the back of Ralph (24
first-half points).
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Boston College could never whittle the lead
below 13, shooting only 37 percent coming out of the locker room to
UConn's 60.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Ralph. ``There's a certain way she plays that
makes you really appreciate the game of basketball,'' said UConn
coach Geno Auriemma. ``She knows exactly what to do when she gets
on a roll.''

BATTERED FREIGHTER DUMPING OIL ON OREGON BEACHES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   COOS BAY, Ore. _ Salvage crews will race time, weather and a
gooey mess befouling a pristine coastline Wednesday to protect a
beached freighter from a fierce storm expected tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Three fuel tanks on the New Carissa continued to leak oil slowly
Tuesday, spreading the thick tar on six miles of sandy beaches. The
tanks may hold as much as 140,000 gallons.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the rescue tug Salvage Chief will try to turn the
freighter's bow into the sea to better protect the ship from the
worsening weather.
</P>
<P>
   Winds of 50 knots and gusts of 60 knots are forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intent is to put the bow into the seas, so we don't incur
anymore more structural damage,'' said Gene Maestas, a chief petty
officer with the U.S. Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   But the weather will provide a brief window to do that. ``We
have one good day, then it gets worse,'' said Alan Hoffmeister, a
spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   Preparations also will begin Wednesday that could lead to
pumping oil out of the ship and into containers on the shore.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, environmental officials set in motion
preparations to deal with the spill in the state's beaches and
bays. Surveys of bird populations were begun and an advance team
from Washington state was dispatched to Coos Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the freighter is 200 miles from Washington,
officials worried that the northerly currents and southern winds
that are typical this time of year may push the heavy oil to the
north.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect it to move north,'' said Steve Hunter, who
supervises spill response at the Washington Department of Ecology.
``Just how and where it will move is hard to tell. But in the past
in winter spills, it has moved north.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the freighter carries as much as 400,000 gallons of
fuel, Hunter said the beached vessel has ``tremendous potential for
a major spill.'' Officials in Coos Bay said they did not know how
much oil the vessel was carrying when it beached.
</P>
<P>
   Most at risk are bird populations wintering on the Washington
coast, coastal razor clams and oyster beds in Willapa Bay and Grays
Harbor, said Dick Logan, who assesses spill damage for the Ecology
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The best guess is that tar balls from the New Carissa could come
ashore in Washington in three to five days, Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Oregon, Coast Guard officials said they were doing
everything possible to contain the oil seeping from the 646-foot
freighter's ruptured fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Close to 200 workers from 13 agencies in yellow slickers and
hard hats were called in to mop up oil the consistency of peanut
butter with shovels, squeegees and absorbent pompons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're skating on the edge here, hoping, praying, working hard
to avoid a disaster,'' said U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., who
was given a helicopter tour of the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber said he may declare a state of
emergency, which would allow the National Guard to help in the
salvage and cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Salvage helicopters hauled heavy cables onto the ship that will
be used to stabilize it and ultimately pull it back out to sea. And
a crew of 13 was on board to check for structural problems and
prepare for the salvage.
</P>
<P>
   The 200-foot tug Salvage Chief, a veteran of the 1989 Exxon
Valdez recovery, is scheduled to motor out to the ship at first
light this morning.
</P>
<P>
   The tug will set out two huge anchors, then attach lines to the
bow of the freighter. A gun will fire the lines to the bow or they
will be dropped by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Then the tug will try to pull the bow around to prevent the
expected storm from breaking the vessel up.
</P>
<P>
   Construction also will begin on a series of posts that may
ultimately allow lines to be slung out to the ship from shore and
the remaining fuel to be pumped out.
</P>
<P>
   William Milwee, the salvage consultant representing the owners
of the ship, said salvage plans ``do not consist of just going out
there and pulling hard on the vessel and having it come off. It's a
matter of the Salvage Chief holding the vessel and working with the
sea to bring the vessel off.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the crew to use powerful pumps to suck sand from
underneath the ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll use the ocean as one of the tools,'' Milwee said. ``We
have a saying in the salvage industry, `The ship will come when it
wants to come and stay there as long as it wants to stay there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Three oil-covered birds were found soon after the ship began
leaking Monday. Five more oily birds were spotted in the water
Tuesday. Crews equipped to deal with oiled wildlife were standing
by in case the slick moves into the nearby habitat of the Western
snowy plover, a threatened shorebird.
</P>
<P>
   Also in danger were oyster and clam beds in Coos Bay as well as
important estuaries farther south.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard said three of the ship's five fuel tanks were
leaking and one, containing heavy bunker oil, was ``seriously
breached.''
</P>
<P>
   The oil was described a ``blurping,'' slowly leaking out of the
boat with the rising and falling seas.
</P>
<P>
   Other leaks were found Tuesday in two empty cargo tanks toward
the back of the vessel, sending water gushing in and causing
structural problems. Heavy waves have turned the bow seaward,
causing it rock 15 degrees side to side.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, owned by a Japanese company, registered in Panama and
staffed with a Filipino crew of 23, went aground Thursday morning
about 150 yards offshore as it waited to come into port to pick up
a load of wood chips. Helicopters removed the crew the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Oil fumes mixed with salt air Tuesday as workers packed
oil-soaked sand into clear plastic bags and used front-end loaders
to pile up blackened driftwood.
</P>
<P>
   The thick oil penetrated less than an inch of the sand surface
and pooled into depressions. Hundreds of bags of oil-soaked sand
had been collected by Tuesday afternoon, but long stretches of
beach remained fouled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nasty, dirty hard work,'' said Milwee, the salvage
consultant. He said lighter elements of the oil have evaporated,
leaving behind only a gelatinous muck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just looks like somebody spray-painted the sand black,''
said Jamie Smith, who walked out to the beach to take a look at the
ship.
</P>
<P>
   The oil was relatively simple to pick up in sandy areas. Bits of
sand were scooped up and disposed of, said Hoffmeister, the
spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management. ``This morning there
was oil everywhere,
</P>
<P>
   but they did a great job of cleaning up.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, officials began notifying Indian tribes as well
as administrators of state and national parks about the potential
for a spill.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters were standing by to check for the spill, said Hunter
of the Ecology Department.
</P>
<P>
   Bird surveys were begun. Dead birds were being removed from
beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys and removal of dead birds will help the state get a
better estimate of the damage done.
</P>
<P>
   Spilling oil is against the law in Washington state. Those
responsible for the spill are required to make restitution, said
Logan, the Ecology Department official.
</P>
<P>
   The state's last major oil spill occurred in 1991. A Japanese
fish processor sank after colliding with a Chinese freighter in
heavy fog. Up to 170,000 gallons of fuel were spilled.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, insurers and the owners of the processor and
freighter agreed to a $9 million settlement. That included $5.2
million for damage to natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   An advance team from the Ecology Department was in Coos Bay
Tuesday to learn about the vessel and to study how effective
cleanup efforts area.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the advance team will soon have to apply in Washington
what they learned remains an open question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early for us to know what the oil is going to do,''
said Robert Pavia, an oceanographer with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Where the oil will go will depend on how much oil leaks and how
fast it is released, as well as on tide, wind and wave conditions,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ecology Department officials were preparing for a
landfall in Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   The hope Tuesday was that the flow of the Columbia, bolstered by
heavy rains, will push the oil out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   That may mean the oil would miss Willapa Bay and perhaps come
ashore around Westport and Ocean Shores, officials said.

   KARACHI-CRIME (Karachi, Pakistan) _ Murderous and macabre,
Karachi is a patch quilt of robust commerce and urban detritus,
where for nearly a decade, two predatory political factions with
terrorist elements have fought each other and, very often, the
police and the army. Karachi has slipped back and forth between
times of deadly mayhem and brutal crackdowns, and now is a period
of crackdown. Much of Pakistan, not just Karachi, suffers from
lawlessness. While the get-tough tactics of Pakistan's Prime
Minister, Nawaz Sharif, may combat crime, it is commonly believed
that he also wants tighter control over his economically troubled
country at a time when his popularity has plummeted. By Barry
Bearak.

ACADEMY VOTERS LOVE `SHAKESPEARE,' `RYAN'
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three weeks ago, a beaming Steven Spielberg was
holding two Golden Globe statues won for directing and producing
his acclaimed World War II drama ``Saving Private Ryan.'' When
asked whether the awards, which often foreshadow the eventual
Academy Award winners, meant that he would cruise through the
Oscars with victory assured, Spielberg laughed nervously.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to be crazy to think that,'' Spielberg said. ``If
anything, this makes me (italics) more (end italics) nervous. You
just don't know how voters are going to think.''
</P>
<P>
   That much was certain Tuesday when nominations for the 71st
Academy Awards were announced. When the dust settled, it was
Miramax's festive costume romp, ``Shakespeare in Love,'' not
``Saving Private Ryan,'' leading the way. ``Shakespeare'' scored 13
nominations to 11 for ``Private Ryan.'' The three other best
picture nominees racked up nominations in bunches as well.
``Elizabeth,'' ``The Thin Red Line'' and ``Life Is Beautiful'' each
had seven nods.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, it was a good day for war movies and Elizabethan
period pieces and a great day for Roberto Benigni, nominated for
writing, directing and starring in his touching Holocaust fable,
``Life Is Beautiful.'' Benigni is only the fourth person to be
honored for a single film in the actor, director and original
screenplay categories. The others: Orson Welles (``Citizen Kane''),
Woody Allen (``Annie Hall'') and Warren Beatty (``Heaven Can
Wait,'' ``Reds'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that I were a bluebird so that I could fly to
everyone's window and thank them,'' Benigni said. ``I'm
overjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Beatty could have scored the hat trick again for ``Bulworth,''
but came away with only one nomination for original screenplay.
Perhaps for that reason, he was a little more subdued than Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, at least maybe now Rupert Murdoch will see my goddamned
movie,'' Beatty said. Murdoch owns 20th Century Fox, which produced
``Bulworth.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Benigni in the best actor category are two-time winner
Tom Hanks (``Saving Private Ryan''), art-house favorites Ian
McKellen (``Gods and Monsters'') and Nick Nolte (``Affliction''),
and surprise nominee Edward Norton (``American History X'').
Notably absent: Golden Globe winners Jim Carrey and Michael Caine
and ``Shakespeare's'' Shakespeare, Joseph Fiennes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's very encouraging is to see Edward Norton's
nomination,'' McKellen said. ``He said to me I was the reason he
became an actor. I hope I'm the reason he doesn't win an Oscar.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolte, meanwhile, was happy to see his low-budget movie
recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a small picture, $6-million-budget picture to gather
this much attention,'' said Nolte, who was also nominated in 1991
for ``Prince of Tides.'' ``One doesn't anticipate that. You make
those kinds of films for the sake of making them. You can't really
lose money on them, but it's just the love of filmmaking. It makes
it very special in that sense.''
</P>
<P>
   For best actress, nominations went to two Elizabethan women
(Gwyneth Paltrow for ``Shakespeare in Love'' and Cate Blanchett for
``Elizabeth''), two women struggling with illnesses (Meryl Streep,
``One True Thing''; Emily Watson, ``Hilary and Jackie'') and
Brazilian actress Fernanda Montenegro for ``Central Station.''
</P>
<P>
   Streep has now been nominated 11 times, tying her with Jack
Nicholson and leaving her one away from record-holder Katharine
Hepburn. Blanchett, Montenegro and Paltrow are all first-time
nominees. Watson was nominated in 1996 for ``Breaking the Waves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet a director friend of mine in Australia that I'd have to
buy her a pair of Rollerblades if we got seven nominations, and now
we have,'' Blanchett said. ``I'd better get moving.''
</P>
<P>
   In other categories, James Coburn (``Affliction''), Robert
Duvall (``A Civil Action''), Ed Harris (``The Truman Show''),
Geoffrey Rush (``Shakespeare in Love'') and Billy Bob Thornton (``A
Simple Plan'') were nominated for supporting actor; Kathy Bates
(``Primary Colors''), Brenda Blethyn (``Little Voice''), Judi Dench
(``Shakespeare in Love''), Rachel Griffiths (``Hilary and Jackie'')
and Lynn Redgrave (``Gods and Monsters'') were the choices for
supporting actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine was the fifth name read, and I have to tell you I was
getting a little nervous,'' Redgrave said. ``But they read it, and
that's the important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many others in the movie industry would second that emotion
today.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Shakespeare in Love,'' basking in the glow of 13
Academy Award nominations, and ``The Thin Red Line'' should see the
biggest box-office boost from Tuesday's Oscar nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the pair, both nominated for best picture, could
more than double their current domestic grosses, now $36.2 million
for ``Shakespeare'' and $30.4 million for ``Line.'' ```Shakespeare
in Love' has clearly seen its value enhanced, even though having
`Shakespeare' in the title limits its audience a little bit,'' said
movie analyst Arthur Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   The film played last weekend in only 833 theaters, or less than
a third of those allocated to box-office leader ``Payback,'' and
its screen count will rise to 1,900 in coming weeks. ``The best
picture nomination benefits movies like `Shakespeare' that haven't
gone into the mainstream yet by up to 150 percent,'' said Robert
Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service.
``Everyone loves to see those five before they watch the
telecast.''
</P>
<P>
   The nomination for ``The Thin Red Line'' should save the war
drama from obscurity following a lukewarm box-office performance.
``It can ride `Saving Private Ryan's' coattails,'' Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan,'' already the 27th-highest domestic
grosser ever with $194.6 million, moved back into wide release last
weekend on 1,027 screens and will probably add another 100 this
weekend. ``It was smart to pull it in November and then relaunch
it,'' said Bucksbaum, who predicts it will finish between $225
million and $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful,'' currently with $18.6 million, could reach
$50 million, despite the drawbacks of being in Italian and focused
on a concentration camp. ``For moviegoers, `Life Is Beautiful' is
new and refreshing,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth,'' with $21.3 million, will see its screen count
grow from 418 to over 600 in the next two weeks. Gramercy
spokeswoman Claudia Gray said the acclaim for ``Shakespeare in
Love'' will help ``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The nominations also represent a huge benefit for smaller
distributors, such as Lion's Gate with five, including best actor
nods for Nick Nolte in ``Affliction'' and Ian McKellen in ``Gods
and Monsters.'' ``Affliction, which played in only a dozen theaters
last weekend, grossing $635,750 overall, will be on 300 screens by
Feb. 19; ``Monsters,'' with $3 million so far, will go from 86 to
about 150.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lighting candles and saying mantras today to express my
gratitude to the Oscar gods,'' said co-president Mark Urman.

a third of those allocated to box-office leader ``Payback,'' and
its screen count will rise to 1,900 in coming weeks. ``The best
picture nomination benefits movies like `Shakespeare' that haven't
gone into the mainstream yet by up to 150 percent,'' said Robert
Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service.
``Everyone loves to see those five before they watch the
telecast.''
</P>
<P>
   The nomination for ``The Thin Red Line'' should save the war
drama from obscurity following a lukewarm box-office performance.
``It can ride `Saving Private Ryan's' coattails,'' Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan,'' already the 27th-highest domestic
grosser ever with $194.6 million, moved back into wide release last
weekend on 1,027 screens and will probably add another 100 this
weekend. ``It was smart to pull it in November and then relaunch
it,'' said Bucksbaum, who predicts it will finish between $225
million and $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful,'' currently with $18.6 million, could reach
$50 million, despite the drawbacks of being in Italian and focused
on a concentration camp. ``For moviegoers, `Life Is Beautiful' is
new and refreshing,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth,'' with $21.3 million, will see its screen count
grow from 418 to over 600 in the next two weeks. Gramercy
spokeswoman Claudia Gray said the acclaim for ``Shakespeare in
Love'' will help ``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   The nominations also represent a huge benefit for smaller
distributors, such as Lion's Gate with five, including best actor
nods for Nick Nolte in ``Affliction'' and Ian McKellen in ``Gods
and Monsters.'' ``Affliction, which played in only a dozen theaters
last weekend, grossing $635,750 overall, will be on 300 screens by
Feb. 19; ``Monsters,'' with $3 million so far, will go from 86 to
about 150.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lighting candles and saying mantras today to express my
gratitude to the Oscar gods,'' said co-president Mark Urman.

TO THE PODIUM BORN: A TRUE BELIEVER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By K. ROBERT SCHWARZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a young violinist, Joseph Swensen had a rapidly blossoming
international career. He was retained by top management, ICM
Artists, which booked him for some 100 events a season. He had an
exclusive contract with a major label, BMG/RCA, which produced six
compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   He had studied with the world's most revered violin pedagogue,
Dorothy DeLay, at the Juilliard School, and had a blistering
technique second to none. He also had something infinitely more
precious: a restless, probing, highly personal musicianship.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991, at 31, Swensen did something shocking if not
downright heretical. He abandoned the violin and announced that he
would accept engagements only as a conductor. Eight years later,
violin cognoscenti still shake their heads at mention of his name,
whether in sadness, admiration or disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Swensen has paid a heavy price for his independence. He no
longer has personal management or an exclusive recording contract,
and he has become nearly invisible in his native America. Based in
Copenhagen, he commutes to Edinburgh, where, since 1996, he has was
been principal conductor of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Now making their first American tour, Swensen and the orchestra
perform on Saturday at the Aaron Copland School of Music, of Queens
College, and on Sunday at Town Hall. Finally, New Yorkers will be
able to judge for themselves the wisdom of Swensen's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Many an instrumentalist has taken up conducting after
establishing a reputation as a soloist: Daniel Barenboim, Vladimir
Ashkenazy, Pinchas Zukerman and Mstislav Rostropovich, to name a
few. But most have pursued the two careers in tandem rather than
sacrificing the first.
</P>
<P>
   Swensen adamantly rejected that path, insisting that a complete
break with the past was necessary to underscore the gravity of his
decision. ``I didn't think I could be the conductor I wanted to be
if I also had to practice the violin every day,'' Swensen said
recently from Atlanta, where the Scottish Chamber Orchestra was
beginning its tour.
</P>
<P>
   The pianist Emanuel Ax, who used to perform chamber music with
Swensen, remembers a more compelling reason. ``He felt that he
would not be taken seriously as a conductor if he continued to play
the violin,'' Ax said. ``He didn't want people to treat his
conducting as a sidelight, something he would do in addition to
violin playing. Rightly or wrongly, he felt that the only way to
overcome this was to say, `Look, I am no longer a violinist.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Swensen may have been right. But even those who admire his
courage are saddened by what they consider an enormous loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a strictly selfish point of view, I was upset, because I
was robbed of my favorite violinist colleague,'' said Carter Brey,
the principal cellist of the New York Philharmonic. ``What made him
such a special artist was his originality of style. Joey wasn't
about technique. His technique was so deeply integrated into his
music-making that only other string players were aware of what he
was accomplishing. Playing with Joey was like a drug, and I miss
it.''
</P>
<P>
   What few of Swensen's colleagues knew was that since the age of
9, he had harbored a desire to conduct. Advised by his father, a
clarinetist, to master an instrument first, Swensen unwittingly
backed into a major career as a violinist. He waited patiently
until the time was right to make the switch, but in the end he had
to act quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important factors in deciding to do it when I
did,'' he said, ``was that I was afraid the career as a violinist
was getting too big, and I would not have the courage to throw it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Swensen, born in New York in 1960 to Norwegian and Japanese
parents, began playing the violin at 5. At 10, he was accepted as a
DeLay pupil in the preparatory division of the Juilliard School. A
year earlier, he had initiated a private ritual: he would lock
himself in his parents' bedroom, retrieve a chopstick he had hidden
in his mother's bureau drawer, turn on the radio, stand in front of
the mirror and conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Even 10 years later, Swensen, then a Juilliard college student,
avoided mentioning his dream to most of his colleagues for fear of
ridicule. No 19-year-old violinist, especially an acknowledged
superstar of Miss DeLay's class, was likely to find support in his
effort to walk away from the instrument.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly everyone I told at Juilliard discouraged it,'' he said.
``Many people said things to the effect that I was being
treasonous, that I was somehow turning my back on my friends and
going over to the enemy. There was that sense of `us' and `them'
when it concerned conductors.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people are still so angry at Swensen that they have not
spoken to him since 1991. ``The people who were most frustrated by
my decision have had no contact with me as a conductor,'' he said.
``So as far as they're concerned, I'm a useless failure who gave up
a useful violin career.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Swensen was engaged as a guest conductor with the
37-member Scottish Chamber Orchestra. Already at the first
rehearsal of Beethoven's ``Eroica'' Symphony, the players knew they
had stumbled on something special.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started the minute he arrived,'' said Ursula Leveaux, the
orchestra's principal bassoonist. ``It was the quality and
intensity of his vision, and his ability to communicate it.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one critic reacted as if Beethoven himself had returned
from the grave. ``Back in January an unexpected bomb exploded on
the Scottish music scene,'' Michael Tumelty of The Edinburgh Herald
wrote in November 1995. ``The incendiary device was Beethoven's
`Eroica,' and the man with his finger on the trigger was a
conductor called Joseph Swensen. At the hands of Swensen, who
erupted acrobatically and volcanically, the stupendous performance
recalled the musical revolution that formed the background to the
composition itself.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, a self-governing
ensemble, agreed. ``He drew everyone out, and he got the orchestra
not only to play their best but to forget about themselves and
therefore take risks,'' Ms. Leveaux said. ``We knew that if we
wanted to grab him, we had better take another huge risk, because
if we waited a year, until he came back to conduct, we might have
lost him.''
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of that single concert, Swensen was engaged in the
fall of 1996 as the orchestra's principal conductor, and his
three-year contract was recently renewed. By all accounts, the
honeymoon of orchestra and conductor is not yet over.
</P>
<P>
   Swensen says he is unable to describe his approach to
conducting, but he regards the profession with lofty idealism. ``A
conductor has the responsibility to go deeply into a piece of
music, and by doing so, also to go deeply into the core of one's
soul,'' he said. ``The marriage of those two elements creates a
third thing that is new, original, authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Swensen the conductor have in common with Swensen the
violinist? ``Joseph's style is extreme physical engagement,'' Ms.
Leveaux said. ``As a violinist, he expressed himself so much
through physical movement, and he continues to do that. He has a
very clear stick technique, and he communicates rhythm with the
whole of his body. He makes eye contact with everybody, so he gets
the best out of all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Leveaux has detected a new maturity, a new poise, in
Swensen's approach of late. ``The element of fire and brimstone
allowed him to draw the orchestra out of itself, which unleashed
huge reserves of energy that had to be be contained,'' she said.
``In this new phase he's finding more colors, more variety of
sound. He's focusing the energy so it doesn't escape in all
directions. A new sense of space in the music seems to have
surfaced in the past few months.''
</P>
<P>
   So why has Swensen the conductor been so slow to reveal his
extraordinary talents to American audiences?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true, I've barely appeared in the United States at all as
a conductor,'' he said. ``I married a Danish woman and live in
Copenhagen and have a young son, and I have a deep commitment to
the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, which takes most of my musical
energy. Having said that, I think American orchestras present a
challenge that so far I haven't been able to rise to.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, it seems, is psychological, not physical. When
Swensen conducts in America, he feels surrounded by invisible yet
implacable foes: the same colleagues who were angered by his
decision and have never forgiven him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether they're there or not,'' he said, ``I feel the presence
of my former colleagues, who saw me as having gone over to the
other side.''
</P>
<P>
   He sees this tour as a turning point. In his own mind, he knows
that despite the loss of fame and fortune, his change of career was
inevitable, and he has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I stopped accepting violin engagements, I had one week of
work as a conductor in my date book,'' he said. ``So I'm far beyond
my expectations. I conduct primarily because I feel as if I was
born to do that, and so I can only say I'm grateful to have done as
much as I have. One of my dreams would be to have a relationship
with a big symphony orchestra in a major city in America, where the
trust level would be as it is with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had turned out to be a terrible conductor, I might have
felt I made a foolish decision, but so far it hasn't developed that
way.''

 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE B. JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back when the LP still reigned, long before the classical CD
glut, a new recording of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony or
Tchaikovsky's ``Pathetique'' would inevitably draw some critic's
weary sigh, ``Do we really need another one?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as CD bins groan _ and the browser's mind reels _ with
choices beyond number, a new wave of mainstream classical CDs from
England washes on these shores. And the old refrain echoes: do we
really need this?
</P>
<P>
   Not to milk the suspense, the answer in this refreshing case is
yes. Well, mostly yes. At hand is a boxful of budget-price CDs
offering a potpourri (or is it a hodgepodge?) of composers and
works, all performed by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra of London
with various conductors.
</P>
<P>
   While rhyme may not be evident, the reason is fairly solid: many
first-rate performances, handsomely recorded, at the irresistible
price of $6 per disk.
</P>
<P>
   The first batch of releases, on the Intersound label, includes
60 disks, most of them recorded in the mid-1990s and none ever sold
previously in the United States. Another 120 disks are scheduled
for release by midyear.
</P>
<P>
   To get a sense of Intersound's multifarious project, I focused
on 30 releases chosen through a quasi-scientific scheme of whim,
hunch and curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   As I made my way through the heap, I separated the auditioned
disks into three piles: those distinctive at any price; those quite
acceptable and representative of the work, and those that might
serve as pocket-size Frisbees. Surprisingly, more than half
measured up to the blue-chip competition, and several others did
the music justice. I'm holding five disks back for the first warm
day of spring.
</P>
<P>
   The long roster of conductors involved somewhat mirrors the
extensive cast of characters who hold official leadership positions
with the Royal Philharmonic. Founded in 1946 by Thomas Beecham, the
orchestra today lists eight conductors in one formal capacity or
another, starting with Yehudi Menuhin as president and associate
conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Menuhin appears in these recordings, but the orchestra's music
director, Vladimir Ashkenazy, and its principal conductor, Yuri
Temirkanov, do not.
</P>
<P>
   Although most American record collectors are probably familiar
with the Royal Philharmonic, this concentration of releases may
afford a new appreciation of an ensemble that has tended to dwell
in the shadow of the London Symphony and the Philharmonia. The
Royal Philharmonic generally displays a thoroughly musical
temperament; its strings are pliant and its winds almost liquid in
their blend.
</P>
<P>
   And at its best, which is heard consistently under the baton of
the Russian conductor Yuri Simonov, the Royal Philharmonic plays
with a collective sense of rhythm as finely tuned as its pitch.
Simonov, a former music director of the Bolshoi Opera, leads
several distinguished performances, including a sinuous and
colorful account of Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring,'' coupled with a
dynamically charged ``Firebird'' Suite (Intersound 2829).
</P>
<P>
   In elegantly cast suites from Tchaikovsky's ``Nutcracker'' and
``Swan Lake'' (2812), Simonov uses more elastic rhythms to set off
opulent textures.
</P>
<P>
   A listener might well assume that a Russian also presides over
the Royal Philharmonic's darkly poetic reading of Rachmaninoff's
Second Symphony (2822). But in fact the baton belongs to Vernon
Handley, one of the orchestra's four associate conductors.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly less captivating is Handley's treatment of a spate of
Wagner favorites (2808). Speaking of rhythm: it is wonderful to
hear ``The Ride of the Valkyries'' lifted above hurdy-gurdy
mechanics to the pulse and urgency of human passion.
</P>
<P>
   As for heart, adaptability and sheer musical elan, the Royal
Philharmonic's grand old maestro, Menuhin, brings the insight of a
lifetime to two radically different works that nonetheless share a
profound humanity: Elgar's ``Enigma'' Variations (2833) and
Tchaikovsky's ``Pathetique'' Symphony (2811). In both, Menuhin
elicits subtextures (and even subtexts) where one often hears only
harmonic underpinnings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If there is one area in which Intersound's $6 bargain becomes
problematic, it is in the core repertory of Austro-German
Classicism. Performances of Beethoven and Brahms, with various
conductors, range from benign to benumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ermler's lugubrious treatment of Beethoven's ``Pastoral''
Symphony (2801) leaves one wishing to come back when rehearsals are
farther along and the band is ready to play at tempo. And James
Judd's meandering Brahms Second Symphony (2850) gives routine a bad
name.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing predictable or cloudy about Jane Glover's
excursions into Haydn and Mozart. Her pairing of Haydn's ``Clock''
and ``Drum Roll'' Symphonies (2849) exudes the vibrancy, wit and
finesse that made the English mad for the composer two centuries
ago.
</P>
<P>
   And at these prices, Ms. Glover's Mozart is a gift, pure and
simple. Her wondrous Symphony No. 40, driving but somehow lighter
than air, is only topped by a ``Jupiter'' Symphony that begins with
splendorous pomp and ends in a hair-raising contrapuntal blaze
(2804).
</P>
<P>
   On grander canvases, Charles Mackerras, the Royal Philharmonic's
principal guest conductor, leads two impressive performances: a
Shostakovich Fifth Symphony (2837) that seems to take energy from
the conductor's very restraint and a Berlioz ``Symphonie
Fantastique'' (2831) that shimmers with stylish decadence. These
disks also share the luxury of first-class sound. In each case,
Intersound's bargain-basement price only masks the value of an
exceptional CD.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another supersonic disk, Dvorak's ``New World'' Symphony
conducted by Paavo Jarvi (2810), inspires a bit of deja vu. Jarvi
engages Dvorak's dance rhythms and long-lined melodies with the
same affinity that helped make the reputation of his father, Neeme
Jarvi, a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   And like Jarvi pere, the younger conductor has a knack for
delineating tunes beneath the music's surface. This
well-constructed, eloquently played ``New World'' is a compelling
reminder of why collectors-at-heart will always welcome one more.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, a disk of Vaughan Williams' most popular pieces
might seem as redundant as that Dvorak symphony. But a Vaughan
Williams program conducted by Christopher Seaman (2836) is an
exceptional compendium, both in its completeness _ ``The Lark
Ascending,'' the ``Tallis'' and ``Greensleeves'' Fantasias and
other works _ and in its idiomatic flair. Talk about empathy!
Britain's National Orchestra, as the Royal Philharmonic styles
itself, wears Vaughan Williams on its sleeve (not necessarily
green).
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on standard repertory in this first batch of
recordings extends to the concerto. And here the musical results
are spotty. Performances of the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto by Zino
Vinnikov (2832) and the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto by Leland Chen
(2823) both suffer from a lack of vision and, for that matter, a
lack of brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   More successful is a pairing of Mozart's Piano Concertos Nos. 21
and 23 by Ronan O'Hora, whose silvery tone serves the vitality and
songfulness shared by the two works (2843).
</P>
<P>
   A surprise pleasure is Vivaldi's ``Four Seasons,'' with Jonathan
Carney, the Royal Philharmonic's concertmaster, as soloist and
conductor (2809). Carney's tempos are brisk; his own playing is
clean and animated, and a reduced ensemble produces clear textures
with confident style.
</P>
<P>
   The overall effect also profits from Harold Lester's harpsichord
continuo, which is prominently displayed in the sound balance. As
foil to Vivaldi, Carney leads a propulsive turn through Bach's
Third ``Brandenburg'' Concerto.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Adagio from Rodrigo's ``Concierto de Aranjuez'' has
been loved nearly to death, its beauty and mystery emerge anew in
the hands of the guitarist Carlos Bonell (2820). Naturally, that
concerto is paired with the ``Fantasia Para un Gentilhombre,''
which Bonell likewise dispatches with affection and craft. A
bargain at twice the price.

THE BLACK ART SONG: A FORGOTTEN REPERTORY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Cori Ellison is the dramaturg at the New York City Opera and a
singer.  
 By CORI ELLISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since Aristotle, and on through Newton, Baudelaire and Scriabin,
progressive thinkers have linked the aural sensation of music to
the visual sensation of color. But is the color of the composer
ever audibly discernible?
</P>
<P>
   The distinguished American mezzo-soprano Florence Quivar
explores that question Sunday afternoon, when she and the pianist
Wayne Sanders present a recital of art songs by black composers at
the 92d Street Y.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Quivar has long wished to mine the rich but
little-known lode of black American art songs, this is only the
third opportunity she has had to do so. She performed a variant of
the current program in 1997 to celebrate the centennial of her
church in Philadelphia, and later gave a similar recital in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I offered a program like this to an African-American school
which shall remain nameless, and I was told thanks but no thanks _
it wouldn't sell,'' Ms. Quivar said recently from her home in
southern New Jersey. ``They wanted a traditional `European'
recital.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the difficulty of getting American art songs
performed _ let alone commissioned, published, kept in print,
recorded, and embraced by critics and the public _ is not peculiar
to black music, as any American singer trying to assemble and
peddle a program of home-grown material can attest.
</P>
<P>
   But for blacks, the challenge may be greater. The phenomenal
success and influence of jazz, the blues and the many forms of
popular music sprung from them have tended to stereotype black
music and musicians in the eyes of the public _ even the black
public.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the fine six-part documentary on black American artists
recently shown on PBS barely mentioned classical musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Black classical music is, like almost all American music,
``hyphenated'': a result of the fusion of old- and new-world
cultures. But as involuntary emigres, African-Americans have often
had understandably mixed feelings about both ends of the hyphen.
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual, the earliest music of black Americans, was
crossbred from tangy, sinewy African melody and the foursquare
hymnody of white Protestant churches. And like many a bastard, it
was often viewed with abashed ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The freed men have an unfortunate inclination to despise this
music as a vestige of slavery,'' Thomas Fenner wrote already in
1865. ``If efforts are not made for its preservation, this country
will soon have lost this wonderful music of bondage.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Reconstruction era, the spiritual, previously passed
down by oral tradition, acquired another layer, in the form of
hymnlike choral harmonies. Beginning in 1871, they were introduced
to the world by the tours of the Jubilee Singers, a small choral
group from Fisk University in Nashville, one of several schools
founded for the education of former slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Spirituals then entered the solo singer's repertory through
Harry T. Burleigh's moving arrangements for voice and piano. Though
remembered chiefly for these, Burleigh yearned to make a mark in
mainstream vocal literature.
</P>
<P>
   His mentor, Antonin Dvorak urged him to draw inspiration from
black folk sources, but Burleigh's 300-odd art songs are closer in
form and spirit to the parlor ballads of white contemporaries like
Horatio Parker and Edward MacDowell, as Ms. Quivar will demonstrate
when she sings two of Burleigh's succinct, lyrical ``Saracen
Songs'' of 1914.
</P>
<P>
   If Dvorak was a mentor, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, the
Afro-British composer and conductor, was a role model.
Coleridge-Taylor took a lively interest in black American culture,
which culminated in three extended visits to the United States
between 1904 and his death in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time, he gave of his sympathy, advice and help,'' Wendell
Whalum, a musicologist, wrote in 1977. ``Each time, he left young
Negroes with new hope and broader vision.'' Black pride
notwithstanding, Coleridge-Taylor's ``Sorrow Songs,'' which Ms.
Quivar will excerpt, mirror the perfumed lilt of Christina
Rossetti's Pre-Raphaelite verses.
</P>
<P>
   During the first few decades of this century, the blacks who had
begun to gain access to American and European mainstream
conservatories and universities were ready to reclaim their musical
heritage and synthesize it with their new skills and perspectives,
exercising what W.E.B. Du Bois, a spark plug of the Harlem
Renaissance of the 1920s and 30s, termed ``dual consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Gifted composers including Edward Boatner, Margaret Bonds,
William Dawson, Nathaniel Dett, Hall Johnson, Camille Nickerson,
Florence Price and John Work expanded the art-song repertory, yet
most of them are known for their arrangements of spirituals.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first black American to etch a profile predominantly in
classical music was William Grant Still. Having attended Oberlin
Conservatory and later studied with the conservative George
Whitefield Chadwick and the avant-gardist Edgard Varese, Still
aimed for a happy medium: in his words, ``to elevate Negro musical
idioms to a position of dignity and effectiveness in the field of
symphonic and operatic movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Still was long obliged to earn his living in popular music,
serving as an arranger for Artie Shaw, Ethel Waters and Sophie
Tucker, playing the blues with W.C. Handy and tossing off film
scores.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, a Guggenheim Fellowship finally allowed him to focus on
classical music. His large and diverse catalog holds seven operas
(including ``Troubled Island,'' the first opera by a black American
to have been performed by a major company); symphonies (including
the landmark ``Afro-American Symphony,'' of 1931), and choral,
band, chamber and keyboard music, but only a handful of songs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quivar will present several items from Still's ``Songs of
Separation,'' a 1949 cycle of five songs about separated lovers, on
texts by black poets. These sophisticated, vaguely impressionist,
mildly dissonant miniatures belong to what the musicologist Aldrich
Adkins, in his 1971 study ``The Development of the Black Art
Song,'' calls Song Period II, from 1934 to 1949.
</P>
<P>
   During these years black composers often based their songs on
the poetry of black Americans, and they felt less constrained to
please white composition teachers and freer to plumb their African
roots, using syncopation, blue notes and the pentatonic scale.
</P>
<P>
   The simmering civil rights movement sparked Song Period III,
which extended the innovations of the second period into atonal,
polytonal and polyrhythmic realms, as well as incorporating jazz
and blues idioms. Songs by composers including Ulysses Kay, Julia
Perry, John Carter and Betty Jackson King sometimes made use of
nontraditional accompaniment like percussion and electronic tape.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Edwards' ``Ballad of Birmingham'' is a particularly powerful
example from this period, underlaying traditional strophic
structure with spiky harmony and swelling drama to achieve a
visceral impact reminiscent of Ives' ``General William Booth.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights movement of the 1960s and the American
bicentennial celebrations of the 70s spurred serious consideration
of black classical music. The pioneering musicologist
Dominique-Rene de Lerma and his Black Music Center, then based at
Indiana University, sponsored conferences and performances from
1969 to 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Willis Patterson, a singing teacher, edited a groundbreaking
anthology of black art songs in 1977. More recently, adventurous
vocalists have issued modest but fascinating recordings of this
repertory.
</P>
<P>
   But the lion's share of this literature still languishes
unpublished or out of print and unrecorded. Ms. Quivar and Sanders
began their unscientific search for material by raiding the music
cabinet of Benjamin Matthews, a baritone who is the artistic
director of Opera Ebony in New York and has been collecting black
American art songs for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just started reading through things and saw what hit our
spirits,'' Sanders said. They supplemented what they found there
with songs pulled from their own collections, sent by colleagues or
drawn from the archives of the Schomburg Center in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``A program like this is just the tip of the iceberg,'' Sanders
said. ``There's a wealth of material out there. I've been at it for
a while, but I'm still just on the fringes. We'd love to perform
and record as much of it as possible. It's our obligation but also
a great joy. I really believe it's a question of accessibility. All
we need to do is get these songs off the closet shelf and do them
as simply and honestly as we can, and their quality will speak for
itself.''

WHAT JAZZ COULD USE ABOUT NOW: `INDIE CRED'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note subslug for JAZZ-LABELS-MERGER)  
 (af)  
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, two of the seven recording imprints that make up
the major-label jazz industry _ Verve and Impulse! _ merged. They
came together under the umbrella of the Verve Music Group, a
subsidiary of the new, expanded Universal Music Group.
</P>
<P>
   (They will still be kept separate as labels, but they will be
presided over by the same marketing and sales department and
general manager.) Aside from the lost jobs, it's a sure thing that
plenty of artists will be dropped from the rosters.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer major-label jazz records coming out, and many great
musicians without contracts, it's now or never for for the
independent label to become an important force in jazz again. Much
of the jazz canon came out on independent labels: Blue Note was one
until the mid-70s; Riverside recorded Thelonious Monk's best
groups; Prestige put out as much fresh John Coltrane and Miles
Davis music as could be pried from their horns.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if there's a paucity of independent labels in jazz.
But few of them mean much. What they're lacking is summed up by the
term ``indie cred.'' Used in rock since 1985 or so, it refers to an
unhyped credibility based on unpredictability, on the thrill of new
music that is not formulaic.
</P>
<P>
   To consumers, indie music at its best alters old forms and
creates new modes of listening; it carries a buzz that comes from
meaning rather than from advertising. It's time for independent
labels in jazz to get radical _ to flout convention, to put care
where big labels worry about bottom-line and to produce labors of
love that create excitement and further careers.
</P>
<P>
   The new indie jazz needn't be brattily oppositional to the
mainstream. It should, however, suggest the river of potential in
jazz's future.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few smart ideas from 1998's jazz records that indie
labels could take and run with. Some are actually small records on
major-labels, but indies have always scavenged ideas wherever they
can find them. With more ideas like the following, jazz could have
its own form of indie cred. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOUND On Sex Mob's ``Din of Inequity'' (Columbia/Knitting
Factory). For its debut, an eclectic jazz quartet hired as engineer
and mixer Scott Harding, most of whose credits had been on hip-hop
records by groups like the Wu-Tang Clan and Gravediggaz. It was an
inspired move. Hip-hop is all about sound enhancements that you can
feel, smell, taste, whereas in jazz, engineers seem afraid of the
idea that there could be anything to jazz records beyond the
musicianship in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Din of Inequity'' has a thoroughly different character than
most jazz records: it leaps out at you, with a shockingly hot
sound. The trumpet solos crackle like the sound of ripping
newspapers; the drums are crisp cracks, not muffled thuds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GRAPHIC DESIGN On Dave Douglas' ``Charms of the Night Sky''
(Winter and Winter) and Tim Berne/Michael Formanek's ``Ornery
People'' (Screwgun). Stephen Byram's CD cover designs used to adorn
all the releases on the now-defunct JMT label; he's now the house
designer for Winter and Winter and Screwgun. For Screwgun, his
designs are arch: in a riot of type and ink drawings, he slips
baking recipes in among the recording credits.
</P>
<P>
   For Winter and Winter his impulses are more subdued: he makes
colored, corrugated-cardboard boxes with an attractive paper image
stuck to the front. Compare this to the design on most indie-jazz
labels, which tend to adorn their releases with high-school
yearbooklike color photographs of the band, usually dressed in ugly
sweaters. (The current lack of wardrobe-style among jazz musicians,
though, is a whole other issue.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VERITE-STYLE RECORDING On the Jacky Terrasson Trio's ``Alive''
(Blue Note). It's too simple: indies should approach artists with
good working bands and offer to record them live and loose. In
jazz, performance is the coin of the realm, but live jazz records
still haven't reached their potential; too often they're just
studio albums that happen to have an audience. At a club, young
jazz groups like Terrasson's experiment with their rhythm section,
their pacing, their form. Shouldn't that be captured on the fly and
hustled quickly into the public's hands? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LOCAL-SCENE DOCUMENTATION On ``Los Hombres Calientes'' (Basin
Street). There's often something special going on in regional
scenes; Basin Street records nascent New Orleans groups, like this
one, a Latin-jazz band that includes the drummer Jason Marsalis,
the trumpeter Irvin Mayfield and two singer-percussionists. After
all the genuine buzz three years ago about the jazz scene at
Smalls, in New York's West Village, one wonders why there are still
so few independent-label records that capture those bands. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXPANSION OF JAZZ PALETTE On ``Brian Blade Fellowship'' (Blue
Note). A drummer-led album, it's anchored by strong rhythms. But
its overall textures are from the ambitious side of 1970s Los
Angeles pop, halfway to film-soundtrack music: steel guitar,
electric guitar and two saxophones create large, pretty chords that
slide into each other. As it happened, the album came out on a
major; but jazz with such a new sense of form could have been the
high-priority project of an indie. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LABEL CROSSOVER On Chicago Underground Duo, ``12 (DEG) of
Freedom'' (Thrill Jockey). The indie-rock scene has reached a dry
point, so more small rock labels ought to take a chance on jazz, as
this one did; their approach to recording the music, and the
meaning of their imprimatur to an entirely different group of
listeners, could rejuvenate jazz's constituency. Young people put
their money where the excitement is; they don't care what it's
called.

SPEECH THAT TRIPS ON THE TONGUE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Franz Lidz, the author of ``Unstrung Heroes,'' and Steve Rushin,
the author of ``Road Swing,'' are senior writers at Sports
Illustrated.  
 By FRANZ LIDZ and STEVE RUSHIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alexander Graham Bell's famous pronouncement _ ``Watson, come
here, I want you.'' _ was the first intelligible sentence spoken by
telephone. And the last intelligible sentence spoken by a Scotsman,
in any medium. Or so it would seem to unaccustomed ears.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the Scottish director Bill Forsyth, whose 1981 film
``Gregory's Girl'' had to be redubbed for American and English
audiences. Thick burrs were rendered thinner than cock-a-leekie
soup.
</P>
<P>
   Things have gotten worse. ``My Name is Joe,'' a Glasgow-set
feature from the director Ken Loach, was recently released here
with subtitles, as if it weren't even nominally in English. When we
phoned him for comment, Loach was indignant. At least we think he
was indignant. At least we think he was Loach. Frankly, we couldn't
understand a word.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said for a whole rash of recent British movies:
from the Newcastle horseracing saga ``Eden Valley'' (1994) to the
Edinburgh junkie saga ``Trainspotting'' (1996) to the Nottingham
boxing saga ``24-7'' (1998).
</P>
<P>
   To American audiences, these films might as well be in Northern
Malawian CheCheewa. Moviegoers on these shores have long been
baby-powdered by British actors who pamper every line as if the
English language were a newborn's bottom. If we weren't savoring
the plummy consonants in stuffy Merchant-Ivory productions, we were
relishing the plumped vowels in stifling Elizabethan costume
dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, though, British movies have become both less mannered
and less manored. And the grittier the fiction, the muddier the
diction. The British cinema isn't dead, it's just not speaking as
clearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up in Glasgow in the 1960s, to move ahead,
to make money, to get a job anywhere that required opening your
mouth, you had to speak BBC English,'' says Lex Braes, an abstract
painter who now lives in Brooklyn (the borough that served as the
setting for ``Goodfellas'' _ a film whose dialogue was equally
incomprehensible to British audiences). ``These days it's not just
OK to have a burr or a brogue over there, it's desirable. It's like
New Labor _ `Hey, we're all included.' That attitude carries over
to the British cinema, where it's suddenly fashionable to have a
regional accent.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, the height of British cinematic fashion may be ``My Name
is Joe,'' a film about a recovering alcoholic whose name we could
never quite make out. Loach has been making pointed, poignant
features about England's underclass since ``Kes'' (1969), a
boy-meets-falcon tale that should have been closed-captioned for
the Leeds-impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe'' is an even harder go. If you close your eyes (and you
will), it is difficult to ascertain a single line of dialogue. The
cast was voice-coached, evidently, by the guy who announces stops
on New Jersey Transit trains. The title character has all the
elocution of Mickey Rourke, which explains why the French loved him
so. Peter Mullan, who plays Joe, won the best actor prize at
Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   Another British export in need of explication was last year's
``Nil By Mouth. &UR; '' &LR;  Even the title could use a subtitle. Alas, the
newly-released video has none. Of  &UR; `` &LR; Nil's &UR; '' &LR;  cockamamie Cockney
_ which borders on Mockney _ the &UR;  &LR; director Gary Oldman has said:
It &UR; ' &LR; s like watching Shakespeare. It all sounds like gobbledygook
for the first ten minutes, you just have to work.
</P>
<P>
   (italics)William(end italics) Shakespeare? Funny, we do not
recall him writing, ``A orse, a orse, me kingdom fer a orse.'' With
the exception of a very few phrases in ``Nil'' _ ``Good mornin',
Guvnor''; ``a coupla geezers''; ``the ol' carrot-an'-onions'' _
what little we worked out could not be printed in a family
newspaper. Volume 6 of the Encyclopedia Brittanica contains fewer
F-words.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another picture lacking both subtitles and subtleties is
``Among Giants,'' which will be released Stateside in March.
``Giants'' is a high-voltage electrical tower romance set in the
vertical world of utility pylons along the Yorkshire Moors.
</P>
<P>
   This dizzying love story was written by Simon Beaufoy, whose
growing Sheffield-based ouevre began with ``The Full Monty,'' the
1997 crossover smash about redundant steelworkers baring the ol'
carrot-an'-onions. ``Monty'' became the highest-grossing British
film ever largely because non-British Midlanders didn't need a
Berlitz course to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Not so ``Giants.'' The most gripping _ or rather, least gripping
_ scene in ``Giants'' sees a fearless Australian backpacker (Rachel
Griffiths), imprudently mountaineering without her partner (Pete
Postlethhwaite), fall from a rock face and into oblivion (Joe
Piscopo). What makes the fall doubly devastating for American
audiences is that Griffiths is the film's only comprehensible
actor.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-social climber's calamity, which she survives, leads to
the film's climactic exchange between Ray, played by Postlethwaite,
and a co-worker named Steve (James Thornton) who happens to be the
hypotenuse of a bizarre love triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton: ``She gamma az inna, Ray! She fella sheeba fa fluv!''
</P>
<P>
   Postlethewaite: ``Whaa!''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton: ``Jaga zina spittle, Ray!''
</P>
<P>
   Postlethwaite (despondent): ``Stu PaBasta!''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton (agitated): ``She fuga luvdja. (italics)She fuga
luvdja!''(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, as anyone would be by this revelation, Postlethwaite
races to Griffiths' hospital room and makes a moving bedside
confession: ``Beffa fubbahopang engla gland leega bunz maw.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths: ``Say goodbye to Steve for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Postlethwaite: ``Neela braygiz amuffa feffla!''
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths (tearfully): ``Ray, I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Postlethwaite (tenderly): ``Mee tulip, goo timi zowap.''
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, as anyone would be by this revelation, Griffiths leaves
town for good. The audience is left stranded atop an electrical
Tower of Babble.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in this script, we are sure, has been encrypted the
$250 Neiman Marcus cookie recipe.

 Steven Henry Madoff is executive editor of Joe, a forthcoming
cultural magazine from Time Inc. and Starbucks.  
 By STEVEN HENRY MADOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The proposal sent by e-mail seemed typical enough, full of talk
about ``digital genetics, autonomous robotics, recursive chaotic
algorithms and knowbots.'' Anyone who has ever waded past the low
breakers of America Online's chat rooms and taken a dunk in
cyberspace has bumped into the same scientific jargon, into the
discussion groups and Web sites of geeks at work.
</P>
<P>
   But what was startling was the proposal's subject: not an
engineering conference but ``Life 2.0,'' an international art
competition mating digital media with a high-tech project of
simulating evolution. Recursive chaotic algorithms? Digital
genetics? Welcome to an entirely new art world. Welcome to the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   With the stealth force of technology slipping under every door
of modern life, this new art is suddenly gaining critical mass,
moving closer to the mainstream. There are festivals dedicated to
it from Sao Paulo to Los Angeles, Linz to Liverpool. A smartly
produced new magazine, ArtByte, covers its every pulse. The ZKM
(German initials for the Center for Art and Media) in Karlsruhe,
Germany, and the InterCommunication Center in Tokyo are young
museums with a single focus on the digital and electronic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, traditional institutions like the Museum of Modern
Art in New York, the Walker Arts Center in Minneapolis, the
Institute of Contemporary Arts in London and the new
contemporary-art museum Kiasma in Helsinki are broadening their
collections and exhibition programs to include works on CD-ROMs and
the Web, with a keen interest in objects full of chips and code
and, yes, artificial life.
</P>
<P>
   If anything characterizes this work, it's the fashionable taste
for sociology over the sublime so typical in the art world today.
But no generality is general enough for a field that's like a new
continent heaving into view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to call what's going on a movement,'' says
Sarah Rogers, director of exhibitions at the Wexner Center for the
Arts in Columbus, Ohio, and curator of the recent exhibition there,
``Body Mecanique: Artistic Explorations of Digital Realms.'' ``It's
not limited by any medium. People are coming from painting,
architecture, sculpture, engineering, dance, video, film. There are
people working alone. There are people gathering together. In that
sense, it connects with older, more utopian times _ with the
Bauhaus, the Suprematists, the Constructivists, who worked across
disciplines and were fascinated with technology. But you can hardly
talk about `technology' as if there was one unified approach. It's
too difficult now, too messy. Artists are using technology in so
many different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. As you peruse the exhibitions, the
catalogs and online sites, no great acumen is required to
distinguish the stuff obsessed with high-tech showboating from the
work that's sophisticated, ingenious and provocative. In either
case, it's easy to be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of new media
things ticking, shuttering, flashing and often disappearing, and
Ms. Rogers' show served as a kind of agnostic bellwether for all
that.
</P>
<P>
   It encompassed everything from the septugenarian choreographer
Merce Cunningham's collaboration with artists and architects to
create a software-driven spectacle of skeletal forms dancing on a
screen, to a computer game, devised by the husband and wife team
Janine Ciricione and Michael Ferraro, replete with
Surrealist-inspired landscapes, a plot derived from ``Dead Souls,''
Gogol's metaphysical novel of lost identity, and, of course, a
joystick.
</P>
<P>
   This work seemed at least passably recognizable for anyone with
a reasonable knowledge of modern art and the occasional video game.
And there was a range of sculpture, painting and video works
involving computers in one way or another that, for all their
varying degrees of science-project familiarity or real poetic
punch, still felt like safe ground.
</P>
<P>
   But then there was ``Embryonic Housing,'' the architect Greg
Lynn's 3,000 digitally generated forms for housing structures that
are biomorphic and strange and glowing, like the abstract shapes of
a next-century Brancusi.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where the question of what constitutes the art in
techno-art begins to seem like a highly ethereal crap shoot.
</P>
<P>
   The approach to an answer for critics and curators already swept
up by new media might easily be called environmental. Barbara
London, the video curator at the Museum of Modern Art, says matter
of factly: ``Well, technology is part of our landscape. We're all
involved with computers, e-mailing, faxing. This new work
represents the world as it is now, just as the Modernists decades
ago reacted to what they saw. We're inching our way toward
something else that we can't even fathom yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Jeremijenko has her own sense of the question, sitting
for an interview in the one-bedroom apartment in Manhattan she
shares with her husband and their 11-month-old girl named e _ just
e. Her explanation of the child's name _ ``It's interactive; you
can make of it what you will'' _ is a sly mix of the earnest and
the mischievous, and it's telling indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jeremijenko, 32, an Australian PhD candidate in engineering,
now lecturing on product design in the department of mechanical
engineering at Yale, has made some of the most abstruse and
provocative works of techno-art over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the art in techno-art?'' she echoes. ``In a general
sense, I think about this work as an opportunity for social change
when everything in our culture of new technologies is up for grabs.
I consider my work a kind of pseudoproduct, a device that
functions, and its function is to offer a vision of how things
could look different _ which is what artists are about.''
</P>
<P>
   She picks up a little aluminum box a bit larger than an ice cube
with a Motorola chip inside. ``This is a piece I made three years
ago called `Voice Box,''' and she hands over a business-card-size
card that has a photo of the box and the words: ``object oriented
sound records(GT)plays(GT)stores 12 sec 3D digital sound. . . .
smart device will trigger when picked up, moved, thrown or dropped
PROVIDES UNSCRIPTED OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD. open to record insert
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   She made 100 of the boxes for an exhibition in Los Angeles,
where they were scattered on shelves and plinths. Visitors picked
them up, talked into them, stacked them to create instant sound
sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were about what people said, not the technology,'' Ms.
Jeremijenko says. ``I thought of them as celebrating the social
possibilities of interaction. But they were also about how we use
things, what we expect a recording device to look like, to be
like.''
</P>
<P>
   Her latest project, ``OneTree,'' is a likely candidate for
``Life 2.0.'' Working with tree specialists in California, she
engineered 100 genetic clones of a hybrid walnut appropriately
named a paradox tree. Recently exhibited as specimens at the Yerba
Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, they will be planted
next year around the Bay Area to show how the social environment
and climate affect each tree's growth _ her argument against the
notion that biotech companies churning out clones can promise an
industrial uniformity for living things.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, you can buy her CD-ROM ``Mutate'' to grow your
own artificial tree, exfoliating among the electrons of your
personal PC.
</P>
<P>
   The evident social provocation of Ms. Jeremijenko's brave new
boxes and carbon-copy trees is simply one point on new media's wild
compass. Meanwhile, the internal twitch of art criticizing art has
already seized the field.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Artists and computer hackers are dissecting, morphing,
reformulating and parodying the graphic styles, the interfaces and
means of navigation that come as the packaged code, the terra firma
of their programs and video games.
</P>
<P>
   By its own pretzel logic, this work is no different from that of
any group of artists reacting to the constraints of the art canon
it inherited. The roiling debates, the examples and counterexamples
of digital styles, give off the distinct whiff of history in the
making, or at least of historical curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond the Interface,'' an online exhibition viewable at the
Walker Art Center's site
(www.walkerart.org/gallery9/beyondinterface), offers two dozen
glimpses into the reimagining of how a computer's interface might
look and act. Coming in June, ``Cracking the Maze,'' a Web show
with accompanying text at switch.sjsu.edu/CrackingtheMaze, will
present a far stranger efflorescence of the new media culture.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition will survey patch art, what its curator,
Anne-Marie Schleiner, calls ``the natural outgrowth of the huge
youth gaming culture that inserts new code or changes the code of
computer games like Tomb Raider and Doom to alter their look or
action.''
</P>
<P>
   Changing landscapes, costumes or the sex of game characters (the
SimCopter hack from www.rtmark.com); parodying shoot-'em-ups
(``Control Space'' from www.jodi.org/ctrl-space); even as
outrageous as trying ``to induce convulsions and blurred vision in
information-weary users,'' according to Ms. Schleiner (Parangari
Cutiri's epileptic game patch for her shown), patch art has the
riotous, subversive commentary of a new kind of folk art.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could liken it to graffiti art,'' Ms. Schleiner says,
``though I think with the number of young gamers out there, it's
really an infiltration of pop culture on a much broader scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorting through this limitless variety of Web works is like
``catching a dragon by its tail and figuring out from its scales
whether it's a good dragon or a bad dragon,'' according to Aaron
Betsky, curator of architecture and design at the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, he has been snatching up Web sites for the museum's
permanent collection, but he sighs at the hugeness of the task.
``If we're lucky, a hundred years from now curators will see these
things and think of them as more than place-holders, see them as
early works of lasting value.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of how they will actually see them is another
matter. Will there be computers that can still read them, similar
software still available, CD-ROMs and their players, even the World
Wide Web as we know it today? Lots of curators and collectors are
holding back for these very reasons, but others are just leaping
into the technological void.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't start now, it will be impossible to catch up,''
says Tuula Arkio, director of the Kiasma contemporary art museum in
Helsinki, which has been commissioning as well as collecting new
media works. ``We'll do what we can and worry later. But this isn't
only a problem for collections,'' she adds. ``It's a problem for
every part of society today, and surely for the artists
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Two artists who stand at these crossroads typify the tug of
technology and the real need to have stable, conventional works to
show. Lilla LoCurto and Bill Outcault, sculptors in their 40s, have
been working for the last year with a high-end full-body scanner,
the Cyberware WB4, making images of themselves that they convert
into large photographic prints; pictures of startlingly
reconfigured flesh that aren't quite like anything else in the long
history of the nude.
</P>
<P>
   The WB4 collects thousands of surface points of the body with
lasers, which are then translated by cartography software, so that
the body becomes an infinitely variable topography. ``Initially,
what excited us was the idea of simultaneity, the way you can see
the figure from all different angles at one time,'' Ms. LoCurto
says, sitting in front of a computer in the couple's studio in the
Red Hook section of Brooklyn.``It went back for us to Cubism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But what has become so mesmerzing,'' she continues, ``is that
the process is sculptural and yet, because it's all done on
computer, it has become so abstract that the work is like pure
idea. It's incredibly seductive, and yet it's scary that objects
just don't mean so much to me anymore. They feel, in a way, like
nothing more than the artifacts of the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of a long horizontal print that's somewhere
between a Rorschach and a Francis Bacon, with a little bit of
Cubist Picasso thrown in, Outcault adds, ``I suppose kids in the
future, growing up with joysticks in their hands and staring at
monitors, won't need physical objects the way we do. But it's
funny. We bring people in and show them the images on the screen
and they somehow can't see them. They've got to see the prints,
then they can make them out. I guess that's a good reason to not go
digital all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   With an exhibition of the work scheduled for the List Gallery at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in January 2000, they
have clearly set their course. Yet going digital would seem to be
the way that an astonishing corps of artists are building an art
world with different rules, different tools and imaginations that
start from here and will end up someplace after Modernism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been making marks for an awfully long time,'' Ms. Rogers
says. ``And even if that mark is made with a keyboard and a mouse,
the process is still going to go on and on for a very long time to
come.''

RECORDS BEGIN TO RISE FROM THE VINYL UNDERGROUND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 14) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FLETCHER ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, a market in vintage records has quietly flourished
among a small but dedicated group of collectors. They buy and sell
through an informal network of used-record stores, mail-order
houses, magazines and, more recently, Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some call it the vinyl underground. Of late, however, even the
auction houses have begun to take notice. A few years ago, a New
York house put a collection on the block, but the sale, by all
accounts, was a disappointment because many of the offerings were
overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   But with rare albums now commanding as much as five figures, the
William Doyle Galleries in New York are betting that the time is
right. On Tuesday, Doyle will hold what it's billing as
``Rockin'/Rhythm-and-Blues: The Fine Vinyl Auction,'' the sale of a
collection of some 50,000 45s, LPs, CDs and memorabilia that span
the history of post-war popular music, from rockabilly and early
rhythm to rock, country, jazz and blues.
</P>
<P>
   It was amassed by Thomas Margellar Jr., a little-known
Detroit-area disk jockey. The biggest prize is a 45 of Elvis
Presley's first recording, ``That's All Right, Mama,'' still in its
original Sun label paper sleeve (estimate, $3,000 to $5,000). The
collection also includes hits like ``Walkin' in the Rain'' by the
Ronettes ($150-$250) and ``Lucille'' by the Shantons ($700), along
with rarities from Buddy Holly, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers see the sale as an opportunity for records to
cross an important commercial threshold: from the domain of the
hobbyist to that of the high-powered collector, much as baseball
cards and comic books have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It elevates records into a different level of collectible,''
said Greg Loescher, editor of Goldmine, the biweekly magazine that
is considered a bible among collectors.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the collection and its owner is the stuff of
rock-and-roll legend. Margellar, who was known professionally as
Tom Knight, devoted much of his life to building the collection. In
June 1997, Margellar, 47, was killed in the basement of his
suburban home in Brighton Township during an argument with his
wife, Linda.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother, Robert Bulger, intervened to help his sister,
hitting Margellar with a crowbar. Bulger and his sister later
admitted that they had cleaned up the blood stains from the carpet
and walls and dumped Margellar's body along a gravel road near his
home. Both pleaded no contest to charges: he to second-degree
murder and she to being an accessory after the fact. Both are
serving prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Ashleigh, a Doyle representative responsible for
spotting potential consignments in the Midwest, learned of the
collection when she read an account of the killing in The Detroit
Free Press. After gaining permission to inspect the collection, she
drove out to Margellar's home, a ``nondescript ranch-style house,''
as she put it, that was ``in the middle of absolutely nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   She was astounded by what she found inside. Margellar kept his
collection in a 20-by 34-foot climate-controlled space in the
basement. The records were arranged alphabetically by artist on
shelves, stacked floor to ceiling. ``Everything was documented,''
Ms. Ashleigh said.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle acquired the collection from Margellar's parents, Thomas
and Estelle. (Doyle declined to say how much it paid.) Their son
had died without a will, and they gained possession of the
collection as a result of a wrongful-death suit against his widow.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Doyle shipped the collection, which weighed 21,000
pounds, to its headquarters on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. It
also hired Chester Prudhomme, of Port Townsend, Wash., an appraiser
with 25 years of experience, to assess the collection.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at the Doyle gallery expecting to spend five days
inventorying the collection. But, he said, working with six Doyle
employees, it took eight 11-hour days to go through the boxes that
filled ``a very large room'' on the fourth floor of the gallery.
The first thing he pulled out was a 45 with two hits by Norman Fox
and the Rob Roys, ``Dream Girl'' and ``Pizza Pie'' (estimated
price, $600).
</P>
<P>
   The collection was so chockablock with gems, he said, that it
got to a point where pulling out a handful of $100 records ``didn't
even impress me.'' Many of the records were in such pristine
condition that it was clear that they had never been played.
Prudhomme said that Margellar had apparently bought records ``by
the bushel'' simply to put them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was more an archivist than a collector,'' Prudhomme said.
He put the value of the collection at $1.2 million, four times the
estimate of the auction house.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle is pleased by the presale buzz generated by the
collection. Tara Ann Finley, the director of collectibles at Doyle,
said she had received numerous requests for catalogues and other
information about the sale, much of it coming from those she hoped
to reach: newcomers to the auction process. Many inquiries, she
said, were from record collectors who wanted to know how to sell
their own collections.
</P>
<P>
   Prudhomme, however, offers a different perspective on the
changing marketplace. He noted that while he was appraising the
Margellar collection, another copy of Elvis's' ``That's All Right,
Mama'' sold in California for $17,820. Perhaps records, ``dare I
say it, are becoming an investment category,'' he said. Prudhomme
foresees the day when collectors will keep valuable records in safe
deposit boxes alongside their stocks and bonds.

   FORT WORTH _ Meet Sean Hamilton, the man behind the scenes.
Behind the on-air presence of KXAS/Channel 5 sports anchor Scott
Murray. Behind the high-flying acrobatics of Aaron Jackson, one of
the best high school gymnasts in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Murray goes on the air and every time Jackson soars
into it, Hamilton has played a part.
</P>
<P>
   But you never see him.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, a former gymnast at L.D. Bell High School, is used to
playing the role of the Invisible Man.
</P>
<P>
   As a gymnast, he was part of one Blue Raiders state
championship, but was not the star. As a coach, he was instrumental
in the early development in Jackson _ now one of the state's top
all-around gymnasts at Trinity High School _ but does not share any
of the glory.
</P>
<P>
   And as executive sports producer for Channel 5, Hamilton helps
make the calls on what you see and hear on air. Except you're
seeing and hearing the high-profile Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton even remains largely unnoticed in the world of high
school gymnastics. He judges various events throughout the state,
including the Texas high school state tournament, but is usually
another suit and tie with a scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton has perfected the art of invisibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't get all the accolades that someone in the public
eye would get,'' Murray said. ``There are pros and cons to that.
But I can't give him enough credit for what he does. If you have a
good producer, it speaks volumes as to how your product will come
across to the viewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys training camp? Hamilton was there. The Super Bowl?
Hamilton was there. For the past two years, he has been behind the
scenes at most of the important sports events in the Fort
Worth-Dallas area.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Channel 5 from WFAA/Channel 8, where he was a
producer of ``Good Morning Texas''. But before Channel 8, he was an
intern for Murray at Channel 5. And when the opening came up for an
executive sports producer, Murray called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't ask for anybody better,'' Murray said. ``He brings
to the job great knowledge, great creativity, great consistency,
great credibility and great continuity, but most importantly, he's
honest and he's real.''
</P>
<P>
   But being honest and real doesn't make it any easier when you
are dealing with professional athletes, Hamilton said. They are a
far cry from the occasional media interview requests you get when
you are a high school gymnast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing about this job now is probably dealing with
the athletes that don't want to be dealt with,'' Hamilton said.
``You've got Dallas Cowboys who you do specials on and you want to
do a one-on-one interview with Deion Sanders, and he limits you.
You go to Rangers spring training and try to talk to John
Wetteland, and he won't talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Sports has dominated Hamilton's life. His father, Terry
Hamilton, was a high school coach in Lewisville, Andrews and
Mineral Wells. His uncle was a sportswriter. And at Bell, Hamilton
was an important role player for Raiders gymnastics teams in the
mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Those teams were led by state champions such as Shaun Bonavita,
Jim Endres and Chris Keller. But Hamilton was there, too, competing
in floor exercise, vault and pommel horse.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was part of Bell teams that made it to state in 1985,
1986 and 1987. He competed at state his final two years.
</P>
<P>
   At Bell, he was not the star, but he shined anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't a great star, but he was a great worker and he
contributed and did everything he was asked to do,'' said former
Bell coach Emil Milan, now the executive director of the Texas High
School Coaches Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of kids on your team, and some of them have
that right attitude that helps the others who need to improve their
attitudes. Sean was just a good influence.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Hamilton's influence that Jackson remembers. As a skinny
sixth-grader, Jackson's only interest in gymnastics came from
watching his older brother _ future state all-around champion Micah
Jackson _ compete. But one day, Hamilton approached him and gauged
his interest in picking up the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, a former coach in the Hurst-Euless-Bedford gymnastics
feeder program, also worked with other gymnasts, future Bell and
Trinity stars such as Chip Zahn, Brett Isbell and Marc Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave me the basics, and then some, to pretty much every
event,'' Jackson said. ``He's one of the reasons why I stuck with
it and why I learned so much. It's important to start a gymnast off
with the right attitude and right skills, so you can build on those
skills you learn. He did a great job of giving me the foundation to
go up.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years after he met up with Jackson, Jackson can do it all.
</P>
<P>
   And it all started with Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaching is something I really do miss,'' he said. ``It's fun
seeing the kids progress. It makes you feel a part of their
success. The D/FW area is such a mecca for high school gymnastics.
To me, gymnastics was not only about the individuals. It was the
team. It teaches you discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   The days as a Bell gymnast are far behind him, but his days in
high school gymnastics have not faded. This past weekend, he was at
it again, judging at an area optionals meet, making gymnasts
breathlessly wait for his score just as he once did.

BY LISA VAN PROYEN, PHIL DAVIS AND STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An ordinary errand _ a nighttime run to get
diapers for his baby _ ended tragically for Chris Rawlings, with a
vicious abduction that left police Tuesday searching for clues.
</P>
<P>
   The former Crespi High School football star lay in critical
condition with serious head injuries, a day after two men snatched
him from the garage of his Woodland Hills home, stuffed him into
his Bentley's trunk and led police on a wild, 100-mph chase that
ended in a fiery crash in suburban Tarzana.
</P>
<P>
   The crash Monday knocked out power over a 20-block area as
police searched unsuccessfully for the two men.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, police puzzled over whether the attack was merely a
robbery or whether he was targeted for personal, business or other
reasons. Also unclear is whether the attack was timed to occur on
his 30th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't know,'' said Los Angeles Police Department
spokesman Lt. Anthony Alba. ``We just hope that we can get a break
in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives were investigating whether the attackers followed
Rawlings from a supermarket where he had gone on an errand or lay
in wait at the home that he and his wife, Barbie, 26, were leasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know, because there's so many things,'' said
Detective Andrew Purdy, who is heading the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One avenue of investigation is whether the attack is tied to an
attempted robbery of a home not far from the Rawlings' and some 45
minutes before the abduction, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The prowlers tried to gain entrance, but failed and left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suspect they are related,'' said Officer David Ralph.
</P>
<P>
   If the motive for the attack was a residential robbery, it would
be among several hundred that occur every year in the San Fernando
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Police widened their manhunt Tuesday for the two men, one of
whom escaped into the Tarzana neighborhood and another who
carjacked a car, later abandoning it on a freeway near suburban
Sylmar. Because the men were masked, police are unable to provide a
description of the pair.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and business partners described Rawlings as
successful, hard-driven and focused on money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very successful. He's a hustler. Money's his gig. He's
into making it,'' said Roland Winkler, who lives next door to
Rawlings' parents in Chatsworth. Rawlings frequently visits his
parents and has lived there on and off, Winkler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris is definitely an intense guy. He's alive. He's got
plans,'' Winkler added. ``He's a flashy kind of guy. Not a lot of
people in Woodland Hills drive Bentleys. It's a Bel-Air car, not a
Valley car.''
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, the Rawlingses began leasing a home in
suburban Woodland Hills, which, according to property records, is
2,845 square feet and was valued at $514,000 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings, who police said is not related to the Rawlings
sporting goods company family, is part owner of the Gentlemen's
Quarter's, a Woodland Hills clothing store.
</P>
<P>
   He also works for Amazon Leasing, where he conducts seminars and
sets up and sells software, said John Perrin, Amazon's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fabulous individual. He's a wonderful dad. We're really
all devastated,'' Perrin said. He added that Rawlings has leased
several cars from Amazon and refers customers.
</P>
<P>
   Perrin added that Rawlings graduated from college, having
attended on an athletic scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a silver and gold medalist in track,'' Perrin said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Rawlings made a living through auto leasing
and the stock market, Alba said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 Daily News retrospective story on the 1986
championship Crespi football team, Rawlings was listed as a
financial adviser for the gaming industry.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred as Rawlings returned home from the
supermarket, where he had gone to pick up diapers and other items.
</P>
<P>
   After he pulled into the garage and the automatic door closed
behind him, two men carrying at least one gun assaulted Rawlings,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Wondering why her husband was taking so long to enter the home,
Rawlings' wife opened the inner door that connects the garage to
the home and saw her husband being beaten, said Sgt. Gregory Hoyte
of the Los Angeles Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   She shut the door, locked it and led their children upstairs,
where she called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Officers in the neighborhood spotted the white Bentley pulling
away from the house and began to chase the $250,000 luxury car.
</P>
<P>
   Police pursued the Bentley east on the Ventura Freeway, reaching
speeds of 100 mph before the gunmen exited at Tampa Avenue and
drove north, Alba said. The turbocharged Bentley often outdistanced
the patrol cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just had incredible acceleration,'' Alba said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the driver lost control, hit a blue 1995 Chevrolet
Cavalier and then knocked down a power pole, coming to rest on a
tree near Califa Street, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The trunk of the car flew open, spilling groceries, baby food _
and apparently Rawlings, Alba said. The Bentley then burst into
flames.
</P>
<P>
   Police initially thought a deep puncture wound to Rawlings'
temple was a gunshot, but later decided the wound was caused by the
crash, Alba said.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The men fled on foot, and one carjacked a 1981 white Mazda RX-7
minutes later on Wilbur Avenue, police said. The Mazda owner,
identified as an attorney, was not injured, Alba said. This vehicle
was found abandoned on the Foothill Freeway at Maclay Avenue. The
victims in the Cavalier suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   At the all-boys Crespi Carmelite Catholic High School in Encino,
Rawlings was remembered as a popular, affable and dedicated
student. He specialized in the 100-meter dash and wore No. 28 as a
defensive back for their championship football team.
</P>
<P>
   Former Crespi football linebacker Chad Santander, 29, now a
mortgage broker in the Bay Area, said Rawlings was widely popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got great grades and was seen as an overachiever at the
time. He wasn't really into the partying scene. Just a real
responsible guy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Quirici, who taught Rawlings in his morality and social
justice classes, remembered Rawlings as ``very intense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked very hard at what he wanted to achieve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His coaches remember him for making a pivotal play in the 1986
California Interscholastic Federation-Southern Section football
playoffs, in which Crespi won a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris was one of the leaders,'' Quirici said. ``He had
tremendous athletic aggressiveness, but was self-disciplined. He
was very committed to what he believed in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it meant his life, he would give it up for his family,'' he
said. ``He never dropped the ball when he was responsible for
something.''

K-SWISS SHARES GAIN FOOTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. _ Despite the carnage on Wall Street on
Tuesday, K-Swiss Inc. escaped the ax that befell many stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of the Westlake Village-based shoemaker shot up $7.875
to $42.50 for a 23 percent gain on volume of 530,000 shares, more
than 12 times the 30-day average of 43,000 shares per day.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were impressed by a strong earnings report, issued
after the market closed Monday, and a subsequent upgrade by analyst
Margaret M. Mager at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. to ``trading buy'' from
``market outperform'' with a 12-month target price of $50 a share.
</P>
<P>
   K-Swiss' fourth-quarter earnings per share came in at 65 cents,
beating a Wall Street consensus estimate of 54cents. The company
attributed its sterling quarter to strong domestic sales that
offset some weakness in international markets.
</P>
<P>
   K-Swiss also disclosed in Monday's announcement a 2-for-1 stock
split effective on March 26 and a 50 percent increase in its
quarterly cash dividend payable April 15.

RESERVES GET EXTENDED TIME AS SONICS CRUISE TO 3-0 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When games start piling up faster than days off, the
Sonics will need to rely on their reserves to make sure the
mainstays remain fresh and sharp.
</P>
<P>
   A few games like Tuesday night will come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   Against a Golden State Warriors team that couldn't shoot
straight almost from the national anthem, the Sonics bolted to a
double-digit lead in the first 10 minutes and methodically expanded
the bulge into an eventual a 90-71 victory _ Seattle's third
straight to open the season _ before 17,072 at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more blowouts we can get the better it will be, and
tonight was good for us,'' said guard Gary Payton, who scored a
team-high 20 points in 30 minutes. ``I hope we get more of these.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Seattle starters played in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But there wasn't much of a dropoff as the Sonic bench
contributed 42 points, four coming on a pair of impressive slam
dunks by Aaron Williams. Dale Ellis, a reserve who plays starters'
minutes, had a season-high 13 points, and Hersey Hawkins added 10.
</P>
<P>
   After two difficult wins to begin the tardy season, Sonic coach
Paul Westphal was able to substitute freely, using all 14 of his
players. Everyone except rookie Jalani McCoy scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really looking for a chance to get those young guys into
the game,'' Westphal said of Vladamir Stepania (two points), James
Cotton (one point), Rashard Lewis (four points) and McCoy. ``With
the shortened preseason and no summer leagues, we're kind of going
blind with what we have. I liked what I saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Don MacLean also got his first minutes of the season,
scoring four points.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The reserves) held the lead and might even have built on
it,'' Westphal said. ``It didn't get crazy out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics built a 23-point lead in the first half and led by 21
at the break before the Warriors chipped away and sliced the gap to
13 points at 62-49 before Seattle regained control.
</P>
<P>
   An appropriate promotion occurred between the first and second
quarters when a blindfolded fan attempted to make a basket from the
free throw line and in the paint. He resembled a Warrior in missing
all 10 of his ``shots.''
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable display of inaccuracy, even for this early in
the season, the Warriors didn't score until the game was nearly
four minutes old and ended the quarter with as many turnovers as
points. Golden State shot 21.4 percent (3-for-14) to fall behind
23-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible start,'' Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo said.
``We weren't sharp early, got some `touch' fouls and got some
people in foul trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors became tentative, never became assertive and fell
to 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out and did what we wanted to do,'' Sonic forward Vin
Baker said. ``We played good defense and limited them to one
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   And a majority of them missed.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State shot 35.2 percent (25-for-71) from the field and
had 20 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense and rebounding are going to be the keys for the whole
season,'' said Olden Polynice, who had nine rebounds. ``If we can
play the Sonic defense that we know we can play and keep teams off
the boards, we're always going to have chances to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all games will be against the at-times inept
Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   But the next one is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we think it's going to be easy (Wednesday night in Oakland)
because we rested our starters a little bit or because we had a big
win (Tuesday), we'll go down there and get beat,'' Westphal said.
``So it's good, but at the same time it doesn't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   First-year Warrior guard John Starks didn't leave the arena
waving a white flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get back in there and fight again,'' he said. ``We
as a team have to be ready. The starting unit has to come out and
set the tone of how the game is going to be played. The last two
games we haven't done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Starks led the Warriors with 12 points and also got plenty of
rest.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that went wrong for the Sonics was free
throw shooting. Baker, for instance, continued his free throw woes,
missing four more Tuesday to extend his consecutive misses to 10
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Sonics were 20-for-35 from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to shoot free throws better than we are,'' Westphal
said.

AMAZON.COM AGREES TO CALL DISCLOSE PAYMENTS FOR PLACEMENT
OF  BOOKS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By JAMIE BECKETT and JON SWARTZ 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Responding to allegations that it charges book
publishers for recommendations on its Web site, online bookseller
Amazon.com Tuesday offered customers full refunds for any book it
had touted, and promised to begin disclosing when it has received a
fee for prominent placement of a book.
<P>
   ``We heard from our customers,'' said Bill Curry, spokesman for
Seattle-based Amazon.com, the largest online bookseller and one of
the most successful Internet companies of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported Monday that Amazon had stepped up
its sale to booksellers of promotional packages, costing up to
$10,000. A package might include prime placement on a particular
page, inclusion in the ``What We're Reading'' feature, an author
profile or interview and ``complete Amazon.com editorial review
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said, ``Such promotions do not contain any notice or
visual clue to indicate that publishers have backed the
recommendations with advertising dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry would not comment on the Times story. But Amazon said in a
press release that ``its recommendations are not and never have
been for sale to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The company did acknowledge that publishers can pay for prime
placement. And beginning March 1, it will list which featured
placements are paid for and which are not.
</P>
<P>
   Effective immediately, Amazon also said it would ``widen'' its
book-return policy. ``Customers can return any book Amazon.com has
recommended, even after it has been read.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos added, ``It doesn't matter how
dog-eared or worn it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Payments for prime placement of products is common in
bookstores, supermarkets and other ``bricks and mortar'' retailers.
But, as Amazon.com learned, the rules are different on the Web,
where editorial content such as book or product reviews is
interspersed with, and often indistinguishable from, paid
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's expectations are different online,'' said Julie
Wainwright, chief executive officer of movie retailer Reel.com,
which does not publish any paid editorial content. ``The problem
(for Amazon.com) is that they tried to appear more pure than they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Ron Rappaport of Zona Research Inc. in Redwood City,
Calif., said the Amazon affair ``casts a slight smudge on
e-commerce. Consumers already have a stigma about shopping online
because of concerns over privacy. An admission from the leading
e-commerce company that it has misled them is a hit for e-commerce.
This isn't fastbuck.com that stacked the deck; it's Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon had revenues of $610 million last year and expects more
than a billion this year. It has 6 million customers around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Internet observers said the Amazon situation illustrates how
consumers should be aware when they visit any Web site that the
lines between advertising and editorial content are not always
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's got to be a clear distinction between what is content
and what is not. Right now there isn't,'' said Susan Scott,
executive director of TRUSTe, a nonprofit Internet privacy group in
Palo Alto, Calif. ``Consumers should be aware what on a Web site
has been paid for and what hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott criticized Amazon.com's refund offer as a ``Band-Aid,''
saying that few consumers would bother to return books or recall
which books they had purchased based on a recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the line between advertising and editorial will
become clearer as consumers get more sophisticated and e-commerce
matures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers aren't stupid, especially book lovers,'' said Peggy
O'Neill, an Internet analyst at Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif.,
research firm. ``They will jump on you if they figure out you're
shilling for publishers.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said she expects that other Web retailers will be forced
to follow Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo and Excite, the two leading Internet guide companies, said
that advertisers cannot pay for higher placement of Web sites
listed under search results. But they do sell ad space in specific
areas under sponsorship arrangements. Charles Schwab, for instance,
is one of the sponsors of Excite's Money &AMP; Investing section.
</P>
<P>
   GoTo.com, a Pasadena, Calif.-based Internet search engine, does
charge companies to have their Web sites listed in search results.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company's pay-for-placement system only lists Web
sites that pay a fee. Those that pay the most get the highest
billing. The Web site promotes itself as ``the only search engine
where you can actually determine your placement within the search
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com stock, a high-flyer, fell $9.13 to $100 per share
Tuesday.

   1. AND ANOTHER THING FROM DAVID HARE British playwright David
Hare loves an argument and so, it seems, does Broadway, which will
have imported four of his plays within a single year. By Sarah
Lyall. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (3,000 words)
+ edited article available. 2. 'ER'S' GEORGE CLOONEY ANSWERS HIS
FINAL CALL Dr. Ross is about to make his final regular appearance
on ``ER.'' David Kronke takes a retrospective look at George
Clooney's years on the series, what it was that made him so popular
with audiences, what comes next for the departing star and what the
future holds for ``ER.'' By David Kronke. From TV Guide Canada.
1,300 words + photo. 3. MEN ARE FROM MARS, ELIZABETH HURLEY IS FROM
VENUS Elizabeth Hurley is a one-woman conglomerate: actress, model,
producer and also a stunningly beautiful woman who, with longtime
companion Hugh Grant, is a prime target for paparazzi all over the
world. Hurley talks about her next movie, the comedy ``My Favourite
Martian,'' her cameo role in ``Austin Powers 2,'' how her
relationship with Grant has survived his 1995 arrest for soliciting
a prostitute and why it's hard for an actress to be simultaneously
beautiful and funny. By Jeanne Wolf and Shep Morgan. 1,400 words +
photo. 4. MOMENTS OF THE HEART : THE STORIES BEHIND HOLLYWOOD'S
FAVOURITE LOVE SCENES Not all of the movies' most celebrated love
scenes were all that romantic, at least to the stars who made them.
Here are some behind-the-scenes stories. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400
words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 5.
AN IGLESIAS FOR THE NEXT GENERATION When you're the son of singer
Julio Iglesias, it's only natural that you might take advantage of
the industry doors that open to you. But young Latin superstar and
heartthrob Enrique Iglesias, 24, first applied to record companies
under an anonymous name, refusing to use his dad's influence. Once
he had a contract he didn't tell Julio until four months later,
typical of his desire to do things on his own. By Steve Morse. From
The Boston Globe. 1,000 words + photo.

   6. RENEE FLEMING READY TO FLY SOLO Renee Fleming shines as the
brightest soprano star in opera today. In this interview she talks
about her life and career - she creates a glamorous image on stage,
but is streetwise about her singing. By Richard Dyer. From The
Boston Globe. 1,700 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
JOHN BOORMAN IN COMMAND For more than 25 years, John Boorman has
been an Englishman in Ireland, residing and raising a family in
County Wicklow. The director-writer has used the countryside around
the former Georgian rectory that he calls home for such far-flung
movie backdrops as the illusionary utopia in the science fiction
film ``Zardoz,'' (1974) and Camelot in ``Excalibur,'' (1981.) For
his new film, ``The General,'' Boorman employs these locations to
play, finally, Ireland in the 1980s and early '90s. ``Belonging to
the European Union has made a huge difference for Ireland,'' he
says. He cites two other developments as having radically changed
the nation: ``The Catholic Church has lost its grip on the country.
And a huge amount of political corruption has come to light.
There's a revolution taking place.'' By Betsy Sherman. BPI. 1,400
words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
IRAN THROUGH THE EYES OF CHILDREN It has been argued that
filmmakers in Iran often tell stories through the eyes of a child
in order to get around the Islamic regime's strict censorship code.
Whatever the motive, Iran has produced films about children that
share a delightful down-to-earth quality and a refreshing attention
to the moral weight of the decisions made in everyday life. In
``Children of Heaven,'' Majid Majidi's film about a poor Tehran
family, the emotionally charged object is a pair of pink shoes. By
Betsy Sherman. BPI. 1,200 words + photo. 9. ``LAST DAYS'' REVISTS
THE HOLOCAUST Steven Spielberg's Survivors of the Shoah Visual
History Foundation is releasing its first feature-length Holocaust
documentary, ``The Last Days.'' The powerful 90-minute film takes
five Hungarian-Jewish survivors back to Europe for the first time
in more than 50 years to revisit their home towns. By Tamara
Conniff. BPI. 900 words + photo. Please fax to Paris

 &HT;    Some fine tunes to hit the road with
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I geared up for a recent road trip by
making some tapes of a few new CDs I've bought over the past few
months.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four artists I brought along with me are from
Texas. The other one ought to be. I thought I'd pass along my
observations in case anybody's interested in listening to some good
ridin' down the road music.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Speak of The Devil,'' by Chris Isaak. Isaak, alas, is an
ex-surfer from California. He is also, I'm convinced, the
reincarnation of the late Roy Orbison, the great West Texas
rockabilly singer and songwriter. I've been in mourning since
Orbison died 10 years ago last December. Isaak is doing his best to
fill the ``My baby done left me'' void in the rockabilly genre.
</P>
<P>
   Issak sounds like a young Roy Orbison, writes nearly all his own
songs, and wears his hair slicked back. I figure women swoon over
him.
</P>
<P>
   A word of warning: Don't listen to Isaak if you're already down
in the dumps over a woman (or man, as the case may be.) You'll end
up lower than road kill after listening to songs like ``Breaking
Apart'' and ``Walk Slow.'' He's got the tearjerker down pat.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,'' by Lucinda Williams. Williams
and my other two picks for this road trip, Robert Earl Keen and
Chris Wall, are more-or-less headquartered in Austin, Texas, though
all three tried their luck in Nashville to no avail. Tennessee's
loss is the Lone Star State's gain. Williams is a fine songwriter
whose tunes have been covered by Emmylou Harris and others. ``Sweet
Old World,'' a song on her last album about suicide, is possibly
the saddest song ever written. The latest CD continues the theme of
lost loves and sorry boyfriends who either end up in prison, jump
off bridges or drink themselves into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Nacogdoches even gets a mention in a song entitled ``Lake
Charles.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' voice won't appeal to everyone. Think of Sheryl Crow
with a slight twang. But she sure knows how to tell a story.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Walking Distance,'' by Robert Earl Keen. Keen still hasn't
made it to the big time despite an avid following among college
students that borders on idolatry. He plays around these parts
regularly, and always packs the house. His latest CD is a tad
uneven, in my view, but still contains enough strong selections to
make it worth buying. For example, ``I'll Be Here for You'' is a
sweet love song along the lines of ``I'm Coming Home,'' one of
Keen's better-known tunes:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be here
</P>
<P>
   when the sky turns gray
</P>
<P>
   The sun goes blind
</P>
<P>
   and the moon won't stay
</P>
<P>
   I'll be the light to guide your way
</P>
<P>
   onto some place new
</P>
<P>
   I'll be here
</P>
<P>
   When the crowd is gone
</P>
<P>
   The last note fades
</P>
<P>
   on the very last song
</P>
<P>
   I'll be the road to take you home
</P>
<P>
   I'll be here for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Keen's penchant for funny, throwaway songs results in ``That
Buckin' Song,'' which will doubtless be loved by beer-swilling
college students but doesn't add much to the CD. The CD concludes
with ``Happy Holidays, Y'all,'' a sequel to ``Merry Christmas From
the Family.'' Unfortunately, like most sequels, it's not nearly as
funny as the original.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Keen's latest is well worth the price even with its weak
spots. If you ever get a chance to see him live, go for it. He puts
on a heckuva show.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Finally, Chris Wall, my favorite country-rodeo singer, is back
with ``Tainted Angel.'' Wall wrote ``I Like My Women A Tad on the
Tacky Side.'' He went to Nashville and never got discovered, and it
hacked him off. He now bears a grudge against pony-tailed
heartthrob Billy Ray Cyrus that borders on the hilarious, since it
keeps showing up in his songs. He's also the only country singer
and writer I know that quotes Shakespeare and uses the Pythagorean
theorem in his lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   This selection contains such gems as ``Gimme Half of What Killed
Elvis'' and ``I Never Really Got Over Losing You.'' It's good road
music.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up one or more of the above and head on down the road. It's
good to get out of town every once in a while.

 &HT;    American partners, waiting to dance
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ `I, too, sing America,'' wrote poet
Langston Hughes. For black people, this cry expresses a profound
hunger, a need to assert the important truth that despite the
limits that laws and institutionalized bias impose, black people
helped make this country great.
</P>
<P>
   That premise sums up the purpose of Black History Month, a
celebration made necessary because our unique experience of racial
slavery in this country has predisposed many of us to hate
ourselves, and many of our fellow countrymen to deny our worth as
citizens. The tendency is to judge all of us by the least of us and
to declare our greatest achievers separate and apart from the rest
of us. If we applied that perspective to all ethnic groups, none
would escape hanging.
</P>
<P>
   This month, newspapers are recounting local black history.
Schools and colleges are putting on celebratory programs and art
exhibits. Magazines contain ads that herald the accomplishments of
black people and articles disclosing facts of black history unknown
to me though I have been a zealous student and minored in American
history.
</P>
<P>
   No longer can any of us say that we don't know black American
history because we were not taught that part of the record in
school. All that's required to complete our education is a desire
to fill in the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Most commendable for this purpose are the many presentations on
the black experience offered by WXEL, the Boynton Beach public
television station.
</P>
<P>
   A must-see is Africans in America. First shown last fall, this
four-part PBS series, covering the period from Jamestown in 1607 to
the Civil War in 1861, will air for 90 minutes every Friday night
this month.
</P>
<P>
   This documentary informs us that many slaves labored unceasingly
to purchase their own freedom, becoming landowners and planters,
until this possibility was outlawed. Unlike white indentured
servants, indentured black people ultimately were denied freedom,
and their bondage was extended to their children. Many benevolent
masters, in gratitude for service rendered, would have set
individual slaves free, but state laws required them to pay a
prohibitive emancipation tax.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's WXEL-FM has a centennial-year tribute to Duke
Ellington on Feb. 15. Remembering Slavery, on Feb. 21 and
broadcasts the recorded voices of slaves complemented with dramatic
readings of slave monologues by noted actors. The arts have magic
to prove universal human worth.
</P>
<P>
   That thought came to me the other night at the Rinker Playhouse
of the Kravis Center, as I witnessed the extraordinary dance of
Koffi Koko, an internationally acclaimed African dancer from the
Gulf of Benin. In his ritual dance for ancestors, symbolized by the
ashes of a loved one presumed to be in an earthenware urn, he
performed with a disciplined fluidity. In the second movement, Mr.
Koko, painted white from head to toe, became Everyman _ and Woman.
Through dance, he lived out the passage from birth to death,
transforming himself from vibrant youth to decrepit age with total
control. The sufficiency inherent in one's own humanity was also
symbolized in the music, created with drums, sticks, bowls, even
the musicians' own bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the audience, I was enthralled. I also became
aware that, at some point in my education, I was taught to devalue
all art indigenous to my African roots _ except when African
artistic expression is incorporated in the artistic works of other
cultures, such as in the paintings of Picasso or dance movements of
a Broadway show.
</P>
<P>
   Because of conscious or unconscious prejudice, most Americans
share my plight. This destructive blight on the intellect and the
spirit can be cured by a dose of uncensored American history. To
grow beyond our prejudices, we must drink it down. In our current
state of ignorance, we are unlikely to ever sing America, together,
in harmony.

 &HT;    Names grace Bubbaland's brash statues
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Last week, I asked y'all to submit names for the
trio of classical-looking statues who are holding a bowl on their
shoulders. The winning entry came from Patricia Scott of San
Leanna, in south Travis County, Texas. She played on the angle that
these synthetic goons are out there next to the highway with no
pants on.
</P>
<P>
   The bald-headed statues are on top of a 69-foot-tall tower at
the theater, which is scheduled to open Feb. 26. It's lucky we're
having a mild winter, or these guys would be covered with
unattractive goosebumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just looked at that and saw they didn't have anything on and
thought, `Wow, the perfect South Austin thing,' because every
convenience store you walk into, that's what (the sign) says,''
Scott explained of her choice to name the trio.
</P>
<P>
   I call this work in its entirety the Colossus of Roads (Rhodes _
get it?), since it is big and sits next to a major road.
</P>
<P>
   Another significant aspect of this artwork is that it's lit up
at night. So it's like the Statue of Liberty, since you can see it
from a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   It's the new town greeter. Shoot, pilots going and coming from
the new airport are bound to use it as a landmark.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be long before fraternity boys climb up on this
monstrosity and paint mustaches on these cats.
</P>
<P>
   I received about 70 suggestions for names for these statues.
Some were what you'd expect _ Moe, Larry and Curly; Huey, Dewey and
Louie, that kind of stuff. But not all the suggestions were
intellectual. Artly Snuff, of South Austin, suggested calling the
statues Owah, Taygoo and Siam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember this Boy Scout initiation chant?'' Snuff wrote.
``When you say all three words together, it sounds like: `Oh! What
a goose I am!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Snuff pointed out that the statues fill an artistic void because
of a shortage of statuary in South Austin. Sadly, most of the
statues south of the river are private yard works, such as ceramic
toads.
</P>

   ``North of the river, there are plenty of statues of people,
mostly around the state Capitol building and the University of
Texas,'' Snuff wrote. ``How many statues are there in South Austin?
I can only think of Stevie Ray Vaughan and these GBHF (great big
honking fiberglass) guys. ... South Austin seems to be
statue-impaired. Is this a problem?''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other name suggestions I received:
</P>
<P>
   Crosby, Stills and Nash; The Counts of Bubba Cristo; Stud, Buck
and Jake; Bo Diddley, Diddley Squat and Don't Know Diddley; Dick,
Jane and Spot; The Burghers of Bubbaland; Shadrach, Meshach and
Abednego; Hoss, Bubba and Tex; Hear No Evil, See No Evil and Speak
No Evil; and Manny, Moe and Jack, the guys who make up the logo for
the Pep Boys auto parts chain.
</P>
<P>
   I thought one offshoot of the Pep Boys logo was more original,
however, since it lends a Cajun twist to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Austin attorney Carter White suggested calling the fiberglass
works Manni, Meaux and Jacques. And now I'm out of here because I
can't stand no Meaux of this.

 &HT;    Yankee ingenuity no good here
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ As more Yankees seek out the warmer climes,
these bits of wisdom sent to me offer some helpful hints for those
``not from around these parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Rules for a Northerner movin' South
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Save all manner of bacon grease. You will be instructed later
how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you forget a Southerner's name, refer to him (or her) as
Bubba. You have a 75 percent chance of being right.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Just because you can drive on snow and ice does not mean we
can. Stay home the two days of the year it snows.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you do run your car into a ditch, don't panic. Four men in
the cab of a four wheel drive with a 12-pack of beer and a tow
chain will be along shortly. Don't try to help them. Just stay out
of their way. This is what they live for.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't be surprised to find movie rentals and bait in the same
store.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Do not buy food at the movie store.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If it can't be fried in bacon grease, it ain't worth cooking,
let alone eating.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Remember: Y'all is singular. All y'all is plural. All y'alls
is plural possessive.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  There is nothing sillier than a Northerner imitating a
Southern accent, unless it is a Southerner imitating a Boston
accent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Get used to hearing, ``Y'all ain't from around here, are ya?''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  People walk slower here.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't be worried that you don't understand anyone. They don't
understand you either.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The first Southern expression to creep into a transplanted
Northerner's vocabulary is the adjective Big ol, as in Big ol truck
or big ol boy. Eighty-five percent begin their new Southern
influenced dialect with this expression. One hundred percent are in
denial about it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The proper pronunciation you learned in school is no longer
proper.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Be advised: The ``He needed killin' defense is valid here.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If attending a funeral in the South, remember, we stay until
the last shovel of dirt is thrown on and the tent is torn down.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you hear a Southerner exclaim, ``Hey, all y'all, watch
this!'' stay out of his way. These are likely the last words he
will ever say.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Most Southerners do not use turn signals, and they ignore
those who do. In fact, if you see a signal blinking on a car with a
Southern license plate, you may rest assured that it was on when
the car was purchased.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Northerners can be identified by the spit on the inside of
their car's windshield that comes from yelling at other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The winter wardrobe you always brought out in September can
wait until November.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If there is the prediction of the slightest chance of even the
most minuscule accumulation of snow, your presence is required at
the local grocery store. It does not matter if you need anything
from the store, it is just something you're supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Satellite dishes are very popular in the South. When you
purchase one it is to be positioned directly in front of your
trailer. This is logical bearing in mind that the dish cost
considerably more than the trailer and should, therefore, be
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tornadoes and Southerners going through a divorce have a lot
in common. In either case, you know someone is going to lose a
trailer.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Florida is not considered a southern state. There are far more
Yankees than Southerners living there.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In southern churches you will hear the hymn, All Glory, Laud
and Honor. You will also hear expressions such as, Laud, have
mercy, Good Laud and Laudy, Laudy, Laudy!
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  As you are cursing the person driving 15 mph in a 55 mph zone,
directly in the middle of the road, remember, many folks learned to
drive on a model of vehicle known as John Deere, and this is the
proper speed and lane position for the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  You can ask a Southerner for directions, but unless you
already know the positions of key hills, trees and rocks, you're
better off trying to find it yourself.

 &HT;    Affirming inequality: U.S. Supreme Court needs to hear appeals
on race-based admissions
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Texans know how Boston schools officials felt when
a federal appeals court ruled that a race-based admissions policy
at America's oldest public secondary school was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people in Louisiana, Mississippi and California also
understand the bind many Boston citizens found themselves in after
the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Nov. 19 against Boston Latin
School's affirmative action program.
</P>
<P>
   Boston school officials should have appealed the federal appeals
court ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. They nearly did.
Unfortunately, they were talked out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Boston school officials first swore they would appeal the
adverse ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. Boston school board
members so voted.
</P>
<P>
   Then, according the Associated Press, school officials began to
hear from representatives of the NAACP and other civil rights
groups who pleaded for the board to rescind its decision to appeal
the ruling against the celebrated school's affirmative action
program.
</P>
<P>
   Boston school officials now have done a full about face. They
voted unanimously to not pursue an appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole country would have to live with the decision,''
Superintendent Thomas Payzant told the Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legal Defense fund of the NAACP certainly was very strong
in their encouragement of us not to appeal, as were a number of
civil rights organizations,'' said another school official.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fight to maintain their affirmative action program,
Boston school officials accepted the arguments that a Supreme Court
ruling against Boston Latin School's admission policy could shut
down all race-based affirmative action programs throughout the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi are disappointed
with the Boston decision to back out on an appeal to the Supreme
Court. That's because the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck
down a race-based admission policy once used by the University of
Texas Law School to increase black and Hispanic enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   From a Texas point of view, that ruling meant that my alma mater
and all other Texas colleges and universities suddenly had to
compete for minority students under a court-ordered handicap not
imposed on the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi come under the 5th Circuit
Court ruling. California colleges come under a self-imposed ruling
due to the referendum approval of Proposition 209, an
anti-affirmative action proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Latin School and the colleges in four states now are
struggling to enroll minority students who are attracted to schools
that maintain race-based policies for admission, scholarships and
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Supreme Court hears an appeal of a race-based
affirmative action program, different parts of America will have to
play by different rules, which is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is a diverse state and it needs to have that diversity
represented on its college campuses, in its work force and in its
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights officials responsible for getting Boston school
officials to drop their appeal probably are right about a Supreme
Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the justices rejected hearing a challenge to
Proposition 209 that prohibits discrimination in state programs
based on ``race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that language tracks the language in the Civil Rights Act,
which tracks the Constitution, it is likely that policies that
offer preferences based on race or gender will be ruled
unconstitutional discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to something as fundamentally important as pursing
racial and gender diversity, all of America should play by the same
set of rules.

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: King Hussein died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Isn't that what
Jackie Kennedy died of? And is there a Hodgkin's lymphoma?
</P>
<P>
   A: Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did indeed die of non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma. Other well-known victims of the disease have included
Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi of Iran, former Democratic Sen. Paul
Tsongas of Massachusetts, former CIA Director William Casey and
Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef Antall.
</P>
<P>
   Lymphomas are cancers of the lymphatic system. There's a
Hodgkin's disease, named after Thomas Hodgkin of London, who first
described it in 1832. And there are a number of other forms,
grouped under the umbrella name of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Hussein's cancer was believed to be the most common type of the
latter group, known as B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. While many
people with lymphoma live for decades, others _ such as King
Hussein _ develop highly aggressive forms and succumb quickly. He
died less than eight months after the diagnosis was first made.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A psychologist friend told me that Dr. Laura Schlessinger's
doctorate is in nutrition, not psychology or psychotherapy. Is that
true?
</P>
<P>
   A: She earned a doctorate in physiology at Columbia University
before heading for Los Angeles, where she evolved from a talk-show
caller to a host. She also has done postgraduate work in psychology
and has had a private practice as a marriage and family counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent movie about the '60s on TV prompts the question:
When did our military draft start, and when did it stop?
</P>
<P>
   A: The draft existed well before the '60s. Conscription in this
country dates to Colonial times when the colonies drafted men to
serve in their militias during the Revolutionary War. In 1790,
Secretary of War Henry Knox and President George Washington
proposed a universal military service plan, but Congress rejected
it. During the Civil War, both the Union and the Confederacy
drafted men.
</P>
<P>
   In more recent times, the United States used a draft in 1917-18
during World War I, and the government began to draft men again in
1940, the year before the United States entered World War II. That
draft ended in 1946. The government also drafted men from 1948
through 1972 because of the country's deep involvement in world
affairs, the tensions created by the Cold War, and U.S. commitments
in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, the government stopped drafting men and began accepting
only volunteers into its armed forces. A stand-by draft also was
created, but it was discontinued in 1975. In 1980, Congress passed
legislation resuming registration requirements for the draft.
Beginning in 1981, all men were required to register, but no one is
being drafted now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much is the national debt now, and is it continuing to
grow?
</P>
<P>
   A: In recent decades, the national debt has known only one
direction _ up and up and up. The debt at the end of fiscal year
1998 was estimated to be $5.544 trillion, up from $5.370 trillion
the year before. Despite payments in recent months of $145 billion
against the debt, the interest clock is ticking faster than the
payments. For fiscal 1999, which ends Sept. 30, the U.S.Treasury
estimates the debt will be $5.738 trillion; for fiscal 2000, $5.916
trillion; and for fiscal 2001, $6.079 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent news article referred to Philips Electronics as an
early marketer of the compact disc player, but was not Sony the
manufacturer that developed the compact disc player?
</P>
<P>
   A: Credit for developing and marketing the CD player can go to
both Philips and Sony, according to Famous First Facts. The players
were first sold in the United States in 1983, and were made by Sony
using technology pioneered in 1979 by Philips.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does country music singer Mel Tillis really stutter or is it
just part of his act?
</P>
<P>
   A: The stuttering is for real. Born in 1932 in Pahokee, Fla.,
Tillis contacted malaria as a 3-year-old child and the fever left
him with a chronic stutter. When he sings, however, the stutter
disappears, and in the 1970s and 1980s he recorded a number of hit
country songs, including six that reached the No. 1 spot. Tillis
lightheartedly used his speech impediment to name one of his
albums, ``M-M-Mel Live,'' and his autobiography, ``Stutterin'
Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is New York City called the Big Apple?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Big Apple has been New York's nickname since the early
1960s, but its origin is unclear, according to the Facts on File
Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins. It is known, however, that
Big Apple was used for a while in New Orleans around 1910 by jazz
musicians as a loose translation of the Spanish ``manzana
principal,'' the main ``apple orchard,'' meaning the main city
block downtown, the place where all the action is. In addition,
Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins says the Big Apple
nickname for New York possibly relates to a popular dance of the
1930s called the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I often hear or read of people, including some famous people,
receiving cancer treatments at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center in Seattle, but nothing is ever said about the center
itself. Who was Fred Hutchinson?
</P>
<P>
   A: Known among cancer researchers and doctors as ``the Hutch,''
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center was established in 1975
by Dr. William Hutchinson and the Pacific Northwest Research
Foundation that Hutchinson started in 1960 with the help of the
federal government. The center, staffed by 2,300 scientists,
doctors, researchers and assistants, is widely known for its bone
marrow research. Many people, including famous ones such as the
late astronomer and TV personality Carl Sagon, have received bone
marrow transplants at the center.
</P>
<P>
   William Hutchinson named the center after his brother, Fred
Hutchinson, who died of lung cancer in 1964, at the age of 45. Fred
Hutchinson, as long-time baseball fans will remember, was a Major
League baseball pitcher and manager. He pitched for the Detroit
Tigers in the 1940s and 1950s, then managed the Tigers, St. Louis
Cardinals, and Cincinnati Reds, whom he piloted to the World Series
in 1961. William Hutchinson died in 1997 at age 88.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard on the radio recently that an employer can look at my
credit report if I ask for a job. That sounds like an invasion of
privacy to me? Is it true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Invasion of privacy it might be, but the Fair Credit
Reporting Act permits a potential employer to look at your credit
report. However, the employer must notify you in writing of the
intent to look at the report and get your permission in writing.
You don't have to give permission, of course, but that probably
means you won't get the job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that the Postal Service recorded a $550 million
surplus for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, and it was the fourth
year in a row that it had recorded a surplus. If that is the case,
why did it increase first-class mail postage to 33 cents?
</P>
<P>
   A: Michael Miles, a Postal Service spokesman in Atlanta, said
the Postal Service receives no tax dollars and has to fund its
operations from the sale of mail service and other products. The
increased funds from higher postage will help the Postal Service
continue to invest in new facilities and equipment to boost
productivity so the agency can compete better with private delivery
services, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1971, the Postal Service has been a semi-independent
agency with oversight by a board of governors appointed by the
president and approved by Congress. Otherwise, however, the Postal
Service operates basically as a private business.

   News Questions
</P>
<P>
   (Eds: continued)
</P>
<P>
   Q: How far is the distance from Earth to the moon?
</P>
<P>
   A: The moon is a moving target. Although people generally say
the moon is a quarter-million miles (250,000 miles) away from
Earth, the distance actually varies because the moon's orbit around
Earth is not a circle but an oval, which resembles a slightly
flattened circle. At its ''perigee,'' the closest approach to
Earth, the moon is 221,456 miles away. At its ``apogee,'' the
greatest distance from Earth, the moon is 252,711 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the Euro, the new European currency, backed by gold? Were
any of the old currencies that the Euro is replacing backed by
gold? Is the U.S. dollar backed by gold?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Euro, which became the common currency of 11 European
nations on Jan. 1, is not backed by gold, says Pierce Nelson,
spokeman of the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank. In recent years, the
old currencies of the 11 nations _ Spain, Portugal, Ireland,
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany
and Italy _ have not been backed by gold. The U.S. dollar, although
once tied to a gold standard, is no longer backed by gold. The
dollar and the Euro are backed by the ``faith and credit'' of the
nations they represent. For the time being, the 11 European nations
are accepting both the Euro and their old currencies as legitimate
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that Congress may soon consider legislation
permitting local telephone companies to charge a toll each time the
Internet is accessed?
</P>
<P>
   A: The issue at hand here is not accessing the Internet for
information purposes, but making long-distance telephone calls over
the Internet. The Federal Communications Commission has been
studying the matter, but has yet to make final recommendations to
Congress. With regular long-distance telephone service, the
long-distance provider pays ``access'' fees to the local companies
where the call originates and terminates. So, the question to be
answered eventually is whether the providers of Internet
long-distance telephone service should also pay similar fees to
local telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the words to the honor codes at West Point and the
Naval and Air Force academies?
</P>
<P>
   A: The words to the honor code at the U.S. Military Academy at
West Point are: ``The cadet will not lie, cheat or steal nor
tolerate those who do.'' The Air Force Academy's honor code is
similar, adding only the words ``among us'' after ``those.''
</P>
<P>
   The Naval Academy has a ``honor concept'' that is longer. It
reads: ``Midshipmen are persons of integrity. They stand for that
which is right. They tell the truth and ensure that the full truth
is known. They do not lie. They embrace fairness in all actions.
They ensure that work submitted as their own is their own, and that
assistance received from any source is authorized and property
documented. They do not cheat. They respect the property of others
and ensure that others are able to benefit from the use of their
own property. They do not steal.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happens to all the Social Security money that belongs to
someone who dies before retiring?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the deceased person had no spouse or minor children, no
benefits are paid from the taxes that she or he paid while working
_ except, of course, the benefits they helped to pay other
retirees. If the deceased left a spouse or young children, benefits
may be paid to them depending on a number of factors, including
their ages.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently read about William McCorkle's conviction in
Orlando on fraud charges. I sent money to him and ordered his
books. Is there someone I can contact about getting my money back?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call the U.S. attorney's office in Tampa at 1-813-274-6245
for information on filing a claim for possible return of your
money, or at least part of it. McCorkle has been ordered by a
federal judge to forfeit more than $10 million to the court, but
it's uncertain how much of the amount will be collected.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle, an infomercial con artist, and his wife were sentenced
last month to 24 years in prison each for swindling customers with
a get-rich-quick real estate scheme. McCorkle, 32, and his wife,
Chantal McCorkle, 30, were sentenced for fraud and money laundering
in the scheme that grossed about $72 million in sales of books,
videotapes and seminars that fraudulently promised to teach victims
how to make money on foreclosed real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A politician was described by the media as giving a
``stem-winding'' speech. What is the origin of that expression, and
what does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: Stem-winding means strong persuasion or powerful rhetoric,
according to the New Directory of American Slang. It's assumed to
be related to the 19th century term ``stem-winder'' that meant
``something excellent,'' in turn related to the stem-winding watch,
which was considered advanced and first-rate when introduced. Older
people also may recall that early auto models that had to be
handcranked were sometimes called stem-winders.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the date that tobacco advertising on billboards is
scheduled to end?
</P>
<P>
   A: April 22 is the date the Marlboro Man and other tobacco
billboard advertising is scheduled to end. Forty-six states have
signed a $206 billion settlement with Big Tobacco. In addition to
stopping billboard advertising, tobacco companies agreed to sharply
restrict sponsorship of sporting events and to quit putting brand
names on T-shirts, caps and other similar items.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has any Super Bowl team ever played the game on its home
field?
</P>
<P>
   A: It hasn't happened yet, but Super Bowl teams have played in
their home areas, including the San Francisco 49ers who played in
Stanford Stadium in Palo Alto, Calif., in 1985, and the Los Angeles
Rams who played in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., in 1980. The
game is scheduled for the Georgia Dome in Atlanta next year. Who
knows?
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I move to Puerto Rico, do I have to pay federal income
taxes on my retirement benefits?
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't pack your swimsuit yet. In its Publication 17, the
Internal Revenue Service says that ``generally if you are a U.S.
citizen and a resident of Puerto Rico, you have to file a return if
you meet the filing requirements'' for your age and income. Puerto
Rican natives normally pay a local income tax, but not federal
taxes unless they receive income from outside Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I keep reading and seeing references to the 21st century and
the millennium beginning with the year 2000. Is that not wrong? I
thought it began Jan. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   A: Since our calendar began with the year 1, that means the 1st
century was year 1 through year 100 inclusive. In turn, that means
the 2nd century began with year 101, the 3rd with 201, and so until
the 21st, which begins Jan. 1, 2001. Millennium means any period of
1,000 years; for example, the year 500 to the year 1500 was a
millennium. But, in normal usage, a millennium covers the same
years as a century.
</P>
<P>
   Given our fondness for seeing special meaning in numbers (such
as lucky 7 and unlucky 13), it's not surprising that the year 2000
carries special significance. Add to this the potential problem of
the Y2K computer bug when 1999 becomes 2000, many people are
concerned about what may happen in 2000, whether or not the new
century and millennium start then.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of when the millennium really begins, you'll
never be able to stop people from celebrating Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have seen the signs on the Interstates stating it is the
Eisenhower Interstate System. I assume the Eisenhower is President
Dwight Eisenhower, but why is the system named after him?
</P>
<P>
   A: When older people think of Eisenhower, they probably remember
him as a military hero and leader of Allied forces during World War
II. But it was as President Eisenhower, in 1956, that he persuaded
Congress to pass legislation and funding that began the
construction of the Interstate highway system. In 1990, to honor
Eisenhower, Congress voted to name the system after him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I lived in Miami many years ago and don't remember anything
about South Beach. But we hear or read so much now about South
Beach. Where is South Beach in relation to Miami Beach?
</P>
<P>
   A: South Beach, which received extensive publicity during the
Super Bowl, is a ``has been'' that has made a big comeback in the
last decade or so. It is situated at the bottom _ or southern _ end
of the long series of beaches that make up greater Miami Beach.
South Beach is generally considered to be centered on Ocean Drive
south of 15th Street. From Miami, it is most easily reached by the
MacArthur Causeway, the southernmost causeway across Biscayne Bay.
</P>
<P>
   South Beach was one of the ``original'' beaches in the area that
lost its lure as new hotels and clubs were built on beaches north
of it and, by the late 1960s, it was inhabited largely by retirees
and Cuban refugees. But a recovery began in the 1980s, with the
area's old Art Deco hotels being renovated. Younger inhabitants
started moving in, which led to the construction of cafes,
boutiques, clubs and other commercial construction. The growth has
accelerated in recent years, and _ in addition to models, actors
and other ``beautiful people'' _ South Beach has become a
destination spot for tourists seeking a warm place in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am confused by the Clinton impeachment deal. I know that a
Senate conviction would remove him from office, but now they are
talking about conviction, but not removal, from office. How can
that be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since it now seems likely the Senate will vote to reject the
articles of impeachment against President Clinton, some senators
are looking for a way to punish him for his actions. A censure, or
some similar action, is not a conviction _ so therefore the
president remains in office.

<P>
   Q: King Hussein died of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Isn't that what
Jackie Kennedy died of? And is there a Hodgkin's lymphoma?
</P>
<P>
   A: Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did indeed die of non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma. Other well-known victims of the disease have included
Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi of Iran, former Democratic Sen. Paul
Tsongas of Massachusetts, former CIA Director William Casey and
Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef Antall.
</P>
<P>
   Lymphomas are cancers of the lymphatic system. There's a
Hodgkin's disease, named after Thomas Hodgkin of London, who first
described it in 1832. And there are a number of other forms,
grouped under the umbrella name of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Hussein's cancer was believed to be the most common type of the
latter group, known as B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. While many
people with lymphoma live for decades, others _ such as King
Hussein _ develop highly aggressive forms and succumb quickly. He
died less than eight months after the diagnosis was first made.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A psychologist friend told me that Dr. Laura Schlessinger's
doctorate is in nutrition, not psychology or psychotherapy. Is that
true?
</P>
<P>
   A: She earned a doctorate in physiology at Columbia University
before heading for Los Angeles, where she evolved from a talk-show
caller to a host. She also has done postgraduate work in psychology
and has had a private practice as a marriage and family counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent movie about the '60s on TV prompts the question:
When did our military draft start, and when did it stop?
</P>
<P>
   A: The draft existed well before the '60s. Conscription in this
country dates to Colonial times when the colonies drafted men to
serve in their militias during the Revolutionary War. In 1790,
Secretary of War Henry Knox and President George Washington
proposed a universal military service plan, but Congress rejected
it. During the Civil War, both the Union and the Confederacy
drafted men.
</P>
<P>
   In more recent times, the United States used a draft in 1917-18
during World War I, and the government began to draft men again in
1940, the year before the United States entered World War II. That
draft ended in 1946. The government also drafted men from 1948
through 1972 because of the country's deep involvement in world
affairs, the tensions created by the Cold War, and U.S. commitments
in the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, the government stopped drafting men and began accepting
only volunteers into its armed forces. A stand-by draft also was
created, but it was discontinued in 1975. In 1980, Congress passed
legislation resuming registration requirements for the draft.
Beginning in 1981, all men were required to register, but no one is
being drafted now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much is the national debt now, and is it continuing to
grow?
</P>
<P>
   A: In recent decades, the national debt has known only one
direction _ up and up and up. The debt at the end of fiscal year
1998 was estimated to be $5.544 trillion, up from $5.370 trillion
the year before. Despite payments in recent months of $145 billion
against the debt, the interest clock is ticking faster than the
payments. For fiscal 1999, which ends Sept. 30, the U.S.Treasury
estimates the debt will be $5.738 trillion; for fiscal 2000, $5.916
trillion; and for fiscal 2001, $6.079 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent news article referred to Philips Electronics as an
early marketer of the compact disc player, but was not Sony the
manufacturer that developed the compact disc player?
</P>
<P>
   A: Credit for developing and marketing the CD player can go to
both Philips and Sony, according to Famous First Facts. The players
were first sold in the United States in 1983, and were made by Sony
using technology pioneered in 1979 by Philips.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does country music singer Mel Tillis really stutter or is it
just part of his act?
</P>
<P>
   A: The stuttering is for real. Born in 1932 in Pahokee, Fla.,
Tillis contacted malaria as a 3-year-old child and the fever left
him with a chronic stutter. When he sings, however, the stutter
disappears, and in the 1970s and 1980s he recorded a number of hit
country songs, including six that reached the No. 1 spot. Tillis
lightheartedly used his speech impediment to name one of his
albums, ``M-M-Mel Live,'' and his autobiography, ``Stutterin'
Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why is New York City called the Big Apple?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Big Apple has been New York's nickname since the early
1960s, but its origin is unclear, according to the Facts on File
Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins. It is known, however, that
Big Apple was used for a while in New Orleans around 1910 by jazz
musicians as a loose translation of the Spanish ``manzana
principal,'' the main ``apple orchard,'' meaning the main city
block downtown, the place where all the action is. In addition,
Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins says the Big Apple
nickname for New York possibly relates to a popular dance of the
1930s called the Big Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I often hear or read of people, including some famous people,
receiving cancer treatments at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center in Seattle, but nothing is ever said about the center
itself. Who was Fred Hutchinson?
</P>
<P>
   A: Known among cancer researchers and doctors as ``the Hutch,''
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center was established in 1975
by Dr. William Hutchinson and the Pacific Northwest Research
Foundation that Hutchinson started in 1960 with the help of the
federal government. The center, staffed by 2,300 scientists,
doctors, researchers and assistants, is widely known for its bone
marrow research. Many people, including famous ones such as the
late astronomer and TV personality Carl Sagon, have received bone
marrow transplants at the center.
</P>
<P>
   William Hutchinson named the center after his brother, Fred
Hutchinson, who died of lung cancer in 1964, at the age of 45. Fred
Hutchinson, as long-time baseball fans will remember, was a Major
League baseball pitcher and manager. He pitched for the Detroit
Tigers in the 1940s and 1950s, then managed the Tigers, St. Louis
Cardinals, and Cincinnati Reds, whom he piloted to the World Series
in 1961. William Hutchinson died in 1997 at age 88.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard on the radio recently that an employer can look at my
credit report if I ask for a job. That sounds like an invasion of
privacy to me? Is it true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Invasion of privacy it might be, but the Fair Credit
Reporting Act permits a potential employer to look at your credit
report. However, the employer must notify you in writing of the
intent to look at the report and get your permission in writing.
You don't have to give permission, of course, but that probably
means you won't get the job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that the Postal Service recorded a $550 million
surplus for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, and it was the fourth
year in a row that it had recorded a surplus. If that is the case,
why did it increase first-class mail postage to 33 cents?
</P>
<P>
   A: Michael Miles, a Postal Service spokesman in Atlanta, said
the Postal Service receives no tax dollars and has to fund its
operations from the sale of mail service and other products. The
increased funds from higher postage will help the Postal Service
continue to invest in new facilities and equipment to boost
productivity so the agency can compete better with private delivery
services, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1971, the Postal Service has been a semi-independent
agency with oversight by a board of governors appointed by the
president and approved by Congress. Otherwise, however, the Postal
Service operates basically as a private business.

   News Questions
</P>
<P>
   (Eds: continued)
</P>
<P>
   Q: How far is the distance from Earth to the moon?
</P>
<P>
   A: The moon is a moving target. Although people generally say
the moon is a quarter-million miles (250,000 miles) away from
Earth, the distance actually varies because the moon's orbit around
Earth is not a circle but an oval, which resembles a slightly
flattened circle. At its ''perigee,'' the closest approach to
Earth, the moon is 221,456 miles away. At its ``apogee,'' the
greatest distance from Earth, the moon is 252,711 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the Euro, the new European currency, backed by gold? Were
any of the old currencies that the Euro is replacing backed by
gold? Is the U.S. dollar backed by gold?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Euro, which became the common currency of 11 European
nations on Jan. 1, is not backed by gold, says Pierce Nelson,
spokeman of the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank. In recent years, the
old currencies of the 11 nations _ Spain, Portugal, Ireland,
Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany
and Italy _ have not been backed by gold. The U.S. dollar, although
once tied to a gold standard, is no longer backed by gold. The
dollar and the Euro are backed by the ``faith and credit'' of the
nations they represent. For the time being, the 11 European nations
are accepting both the Euro and their old currencies as legitimate
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that Congress may soon consider legislation
permitting local telephone companies to charge a toll each time the
Internet is accessed?
</P>
<P>
   A: The issue at hand here is not accessing the Internet for
information purposes, but making long-distance telephone calls over
the Internet. The Federal Communications Commission has been
studying the matter, but has yet to make final recommendations to
Congress. With regular long-distance telephone service, the
long-distance provider pays ``access'' fees to the local companies
where the call originates and terminates. So, the question to be
answered eventually is whether the providers of Internet
long-distance telephone service should also pay similar fees to
local telephone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the words to the honor codes at West Point and the
Naval and Air Force academies?
</P>
<P>
   A: The words to the honor code at the U.S. Military Academy at
West Point are: ``The cadet will not lie, cheat or steal nor
tolerate those who do.'' The Air Force Academy's honor code is
similar, adding only the words ``among us'' after ``those.''
</P>
<P>
   The Naval Academy has a ``honor concept'' that is longer. It
reads: ``Midshipmen are persons of integrity. They stand for that
which is right. They tell the truth and ensure that the full truth
is known. They do not lie. They embrace fairness in all actions.
They ensure that work submitted as their own is their own, and that
assistance received from any source is authorized and property
documented. They do not cheat. They respect the property of others
and ensure that others are able to benefit from the use of their
own property. They do not steal.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happens to all the Social Security money that belongs to
someone who dies before retiring?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the deceased person had no spouse or minor children, no
benefits are paid from the taxes that she or he paid while working
_ except, of course, the benefits they helped to pay other
retirees. If the deceased left a spouse or young children, benefits
may be paid to them depending on a number of factors, including
their ages.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently read about William McCorkle's conviction in
Orlando on fraud charges. I sent money to him and ordered his
books. Is there someone I can contact about getting my money back?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call the U.S. attorney's office in Tampa at 1-813-274-6245
for information on filing a claim for possible return of your
money, or at least part of it. McCorkle has been ordered by a
federal judge to forfeit more than $10 million to the court, but
it's uncertain how much of the amount will be collected.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle, an infomercial con artist, and his wife were sentenced
last month to 24 years in prison each for swindling customers with
a get-rich-quick real estate scheme. McCorkle, 32, and his wife,
Chantal McCorkle, 30, were sentenced for fraud and money laundering
in the scheme that grossed about $72 million in sales of books,
videotapes and seminars that fraudulently promised to teach victims
how to make money on foreclosed real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A politician was described by the media as giving a
``stem-winding'' speech. What is the origin of that expression, and
what does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: Stem-winding means strong persuasion or powerful rhetoric,
according to the New Directory of American Slang. It's assumed to
be related to the 19th century term ``stem-winder'' that meant
``something excellent,'' in turn related to the stem-winding watch,
which was considered advanced and first-rate when introduced. Older
people also may recall that early auto models that had to be
handcranked were sometimes called stem-winders.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the date that tobacco advertising on billboards is
scheduled to end?
</P>
<P>
   A: April 22 is the date the Marlboro Man and other tobacco
billboard advertising is scheduled to end. Forty-six states have
signed a $206 billion settlement with Big Tobacco. In addition to
stopping billboard advertising, tobacco companies agreed to sharply
restrict sponsorship of sporting events and to quit putting brand
names on T-shirts, caps and other similar items.

 &HT;    CD REVIEWS: `Valence Street' sets higher a standard for the
Neville Brothers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Valence Street''
</P>
<P>
   Neville Brothers
</P>
<P>
   Columbia
</P>
<P>
   If not quite an artistic rebirth, the Neville Brothers' first
album since signing with Columbia is easily their best in a decade.
Not since 1989's ``Yellow Moon'' has the New Orleans band fashioned
such an ambitiously cohesive song cycle while refusing to reduce
the brotherly collective to the Aaron Neville show. Though the
results may not satisfy either the cult of Aaron or the
groove-happy, neo-hippie contingent that the band inherited from
the Grateful Dead, the production _ by the Nevilles with Tommy Sims
_ underscores the crucial distinction between the recording studio
and the concert stage, a consideration often ignored on lesser
Neville releases.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of renewal announces itself with the album-opening
``Over Africa'' as the whip-crack dynamism of the arrangement
reinforces the oracular authority of Art Neville's baritone, while
the chorus' fraternal harmonies soar around him. A similar spirit
infuses his reading of Richard Thompson's ``Dimming of the Day,''
where Art's open-hearted phrasing is so down-home country it
recalls George Jones, yet the soulfulness of the sound is pure
gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Such performances transcend conventional categories, while
synthesizing the disparate strengths of the Nevilles. Where
youngest brother Cyril has typically served as the band's social
conscience, the romantic balladry of his ``Utterly Beloved'' shows
the softer, more supple side of his vocal range, while the closing
``Tears,'' written with saxophonist Charles, offers a full-circle
return to the spiritual/mystical roots of rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   The four songs showcasing Aaron's trembling, aching falsetto
never succumb to schmaltz. Instead, the album's first single, ``A
Little Bit of Heaven,'' has enough of a liltingly rhythmic
insistence to it that the song seems very much a part of the pulse
of the album as a whole, as does a reggae transformation of ``If I
Had a Hammer.'' On Wyclef Jean's ``Mona Lisa,'' Aaron even ventures
into hip-hop territory, his warble providing effective complement
to Wyclef's streetwise drawl. Only the Cate Brothers' ``Give Me a
Reason'' reflects the sort of balladry that one might more
typically find on an Aaron Neville solo album.
</P>
<P>
   As for saxophonist Charles, his horn work effectively punctuates
the performances of the others, providing as much of an
instrumental signature as Art's keyboards, but his spotlight turn
on the title cut finds him stuck in a time-warped '70s groove.
Similarly, Art's ``Real Funk'' genre excursion might well move some
bodies in concert, yet sounds like filler on a studio recording.
Though such filler was way too prevalent on previous Neville
albums, ``Valence Street'' raises the standards and the stakes.
After almost 50 years of making music, individually and
collectively, it's something of a miracle for the brothers to sound
as fresh as the Nevilles do here.

   ``How It Feels to be Something On''
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Day Real Estate
</P>
<P>
   Sub Pop
</P>
<P>
   Since its initial breakup in 1995, Seattle's mood-swinging
indie-rock outfit Sunny Day Real Estate has sort of taken over the
Flatlanders' slogan of being ``more a legend than a band.'' Many
people found out about the group after the split, when it released
its second album (self-titled) just as bassist Nate Mendel and
drummer William Goldsmith joined the Foo Fighters and singer Jeremy
Enigk began work on his freakish yet acclaimed solo debut, ``Return
of the Frog Queen.''
</P>
<P>
   Reformed last year minus Mendel, Sunny Day is apparently out to
further its cult-legend status rather than just lay claim to it.
The band's third album, ``How It Feels to be Something On,'' is its
most realized and fine-tuned if not gutsiest effort to date.
Brooding and biting at the same time, it features the emotional
roller coaster sound that originally made the band so likable.
There's greater attention paid to arrangements, though (check out
the ``Quadrophenia''-derived track ``The Prophet''), perhaps a
result of Enigk's work with a 21-piece orchestra on his solo album.
</P>
<P>
   This one deserves to be filed next to Radiohead more than Foo.
Enigk takes on a Roger Waters-like quality on songs such as ``Two
Promises'' and the gorgeous ``Guitar and Video Games.'' The band as
a whole, including guitarist Dan Hoerner and new bassist Jeff
Palmer, sounds like it never even took a holiday, especially on the
tight-as-sardines title track. A reunion for all the right reasons,
this installment of Sunny Day may be the one that indeed becomes
the stuff of legend.

   ``Blaze Foley: In Tribute and Loving Memory''

   Various artists
</P>
<P>
   Deep South
</P>
<P>
   Coming 10 years after his murder, and some five years after this
project was started, Blaze Foley's much-deserved tribute album has
all the qualities one would hope for _ which is a lot of heart and
warmth, if not perfection. Best known as the songwriter of ``If I
Could Only Fly,'' covered by Waylon and Willie, as well as the
posthumous subject of Lucinda Williams' ``Drunken Angel,'' Foley
wrote lovin' and drinkin' songs that could melt the toughest of
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the singer-songwriters featured here were cut from the
same cloth, including Townes Van Zandt and Jubal Clark, themselves
now deceased, plus Timbuk3 (broken up) and Austin fixtures such as
Kimmie Rhodes, the Texana Dames, Mandy Mercier, Calvin Russell and
more. The disc has an unwavering old-Austin feel to it, which is as
appealing now as it was back before Foley was shot. As this tribute
points out, a piece of that Austin was lost with Blaze, but it can
be reclaimed anytime we want.

   ``I Left My Heart . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Red Garland
</P>
<P>
   32 Jazz
</P>
<P>
   The late Texas pianist Red Garland was a major force in the
evolution of modern jazz through his classic work with the
legendary Miles Davis Quintet of the '50s, but he virtually
disappeared from the scene in subsequent years as he returned home
to Dallas and maintained a low profile until his death in 1984.
Garland, however, was lured out of semiretirement in 1978 for a
recording session at San Francisco's quintessential jazz venue,
Keystone Korner, and the results stand the test of time quite
nicely on the newly reissued recording.
</P>
<P>
   Garland, frequently stepping outside his signature block chords
for a more enlightened swing approach, is ably backed by a rhythm
section of Bay Area stalwarts, drummer Eddie Moore and bassist
Chris Amberger, but it's a fellow Texan who lights the spark that
sets the session on fire. Garland leads the trio through several
straight-ahead standards, including ``Bye Bye Blackbird'' and a
bluesy rendition of Percy Mayfield's ``Please Send Me Someone To
Love'' before alto saxophonist Leo Wright, an early fixture on the
Dallas scene who became a successful European jazz emigre, joins in
the action.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, beginning with a gorgeous treatment of ``Body and
Soul,'' elevates what was previously an enjoyable live piano trio
date into something special with uniformly superlative soloing.
Garland, who backed everyone from Coleman Hawkins to John Coltrane,
exhibits his deft expertise at accompaniment while also
contributing some tasty moments of his own. The quartet bops the
blues on Milt Jackson's ``Bag's Groove'' before concluding the
session with a timeless take of ``I Left My Heart in San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not a barrier-breaking set by any means, but it is an
excellent and highly entertaining example of the subtle and
unpredictable synergy of live jazz, as well as a rare and valuable
addition to the Texas jazz catalog.

Patricia Scott of San Leanna, in south Travis County, Texas. She
played on the angle that these synthetic goons are out there next
to the highway with no pants on. The bald-headed statues are on top
of a 69-foot-tall tower at the theater, which is scheduled to open

   JEFFERSON-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ `I, too, sing

expresses a profound hunger, a need to assert the important truth
that despite the limits that laws and institutionalized bias
impose, black people helped make this country great. That premise
sums up the purpose of Black History Month, a celebration made
necessary because our unique experience of racial slavery in this
country has predisposed many of us to hate ourselves, and many of
our fellow countrymen to deny our worth as citizens. The tendency
is to judge all of us by the least of us and to declare our
greatest achievers separate and apart from the rest of us. If we
applied that perspective to all ethnic groups, none would escape
hanging. (Jefferson, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

AMAZON.COM PLANS TO REVISE ITS AD PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds, fixes hed; no other changes)   (nk)  
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faced with e-mail rebukes from its customers, the online
retailer Amazon.com on Tuesday revised its new advertising policy,
pledging to disclose every time when book publishers pay to feature
titles on its electronic bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based company said it was still figuring out the
mechanics of this new policy, but it will take effect March 1. In
the meantime, Amazon has expanded its book-return policy to
demonstrate its faith in its recommendations, vowing to accept
titles from dissatisfied customers ``no matter how dog-eared or
worn it is,'' in the words of the company's chief executive and
founder, Jeff Bezos.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy comes after The New York Times reported Monday
that Amazon had fashioned an ``e-merchandising'' program for book
publishers that sought advertising dollars for featured treatment
of titles in categories that range from ``What We're Reading'' to
``Destined for Greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon did not disclose the advertising fees, which ranged from
$250 to $12,500, to its customers. The bookseller contended that
its sites were not for sale because editors screened and vetted
books worthy of highlighting.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's change in policy signaled a recognition that Amazon _
with its reviews, recommendations and friendly interaction with
customers _ is a hybrid, both bookseller and electronic adviser,
somehow different from bookstore chains or supermarkets that
commonly sell shelf space for products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always listening to our customers and it was clear that
our customers had a higher expectation for us than the physical
bookselling world,'' said Bill Curry, a company spokesman, who said
that customers had sent electronic mail expressing surprise at
Amazon's advertising approach.
</P>
<P>
   Curry said that Amazon would continue to offer the advertising
program to publishers, but that it would create a system indicating
which features have been paid for. Amazon started the program last
June and then expanded its scope and prices in January, attracting
money called ``cooperative advertising allowances'' from many major
publishers including Random House, Simon &AMP; Schuster, HarperCollins,
Warner Books and Penguin Putnam.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon had offered the program to about 20 to 50 publishers, and
planned to extend the same opportunities to more publishers later
this year. The program drew a mixed response from publishers,
ranging from smaller presses that feared they would not be able to
afford to play to larger publishers who considered the promotions
equivalent to the front table space or shelf-end caps offered for
co-op advertising dollars by bookstore chains.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Random House, now owned by Bertelsmann A.G., paid
Amazon for featured treatment of Peter Jennings' best seller, ``The
Century.'' Simon &AMP; Schuster, a unit of Viacom, backed titles on
Amazon ranging from Stephen King's ``Bag of Bones'' to a seasonal
Valentine's promotion for ``Best American Erotica.''
</P>
<P>
   The most expensive category for promotion was computer books,
critical placement that resulted in significant sales increases for
IDG Books Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Laurence J. Kirshbaum, chairman of Time Warner Trade
Publishing, which includes Warner Books and Little, Brown &AMP; Co.,
called Amazon's new policy of openness ``a sensible step'' that
will only enhance the credibility of the online bookstore and
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   His own company had paid to feature more than a dozen titles,
some of which experienced significant sales increases such as Roy
Blount Jr.'s photo book of dog poetry, ``If Only You Knew How Much
I Smell You: True Portraits of Dogs'' or Tom Grace's first novel,
``Spyder Web.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kirshbaum said he did not believe that Amazon's change in
policy would have an impact on future promotions subsidized with
advertising dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the customers will respond to the new system because
the publishers can muster very effective advertising concepts that
will appeal to them,'' he said. ``All we really want as publishers
is a chance to display our wares and this will give it.''

 &HT;    Beach billboards may be coming to a vacation site near you
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Forget sweet proclamations of love. The
next message you read in the sand at dawn's first light may be
urging you to drink Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Dori, the owner of a small New Jersey ad agency, is pitching
a concept as new as beaches are old: Billboards in the sand. And
the Sunshine State is high on his list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first new medium since the Internet,'' says Dori, who
said the idea to mass produce advertisements on the beach came to
him in a dream. ``It's biodegradable advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   It works like this: A 4-foot-high cylinder wrapped in a rubber
mat and imprinted with a commercial advertisement is pulled behind
a truck that rakes the beach every morning. As the cylinder rolls,
graphics and slogans from the mat are pressed a half-inch deep into
the sand. The result is a parquet of product placement which
crumbles as soon as it's touched.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial possibilities, Dori gushes, are endless: Soft
drinks, sun tan lotion, ice cream, restaurants, movie promotions,
mile after mile of slogans, row after row of peppy mascots 12-feet
long and 4-feet wide. Forget Frank Loves Angela. Welcome to `Your
Ad Here.'
</P>
<P>
   Dori landed his first client last summer. He ran a one-month
trial hawking Skippy Peanut butter on the beaches of Seaside
Heights on the New Jersey Shore. Skippy paid Dori $25,000 for the
exposure, the town charged him about $3,000 to use the beach, and
everybody who went to the shore looking for suntan got an ad
between their toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very happy with it,'' said Michael Lyon, director of
promotions for Skippy in New jersey. ``We weren't able to measure
sales with it but were happy to be able to remind people of our
product, especially where there are a lot of families and they're
feeling good.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyon said Skippy will do it again, and this winter, patent
firmly in place, Dori has been traveling the coasts _ east and west
_ pitching his product. He says the ads drew applause from
passersby on the cliffs overlooking the San Diego shoreline. But in
Miami, where Dori show-cased the billboards during Superbowl
weekend, the city's tourism and promotions Director, Michael Aller,
said no way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over-commercialism,'' he said. ``We want to keep the
beach the beach.'' Fort Lauderdale, Fla. has been more liberal with
its definitions. The city's beach advisory board voted 13-2 in
favor of letting Dori sell their sand this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would bring revenue to the city,'' said Johnny Alexander,
an advisory board member. ``I don't have a problem with it. I know
some people thought it was a bit much but with it being in the sand
I thought it was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant Smith, another board member disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a horrible idea,'' he said ``People come to the
area to enjoy the natural beauty here. This won't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Before billboards in the sand start rolling out in Fort
Lauderdale, city attorneys have to determine whether they violate
an ordinance prohibiting billboards on the beach. If they get a
legal OK, the issue goes to the city commission, said Fort
Lauderdale Parks Superintendent Phil Thornburg. He said the city
will likely make a decision by May.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Dori said he expects his idea to catch on, but right
now he must sell it beach by beach. In Florida he has pitched the
product to five high-traffic hot spots. Officials in Volusia
County, Fla., who oversee Daytona Beach, heard about the wash-away
billboards through word-of-mouth and are considering the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a commercial beach and we have a lot of promotions so
this might work here,'' said Joe Wooden, Deputy Chief of Volusia
County Beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden said the promotion could appeal to tourists without
flattening the beach's other draw: nesting turtles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any concern, the turtles win,'' he said. ``But
they're not incompatible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lake Worth, Fla. Mayor Tom Ramiccio, who has not yet been
approached by Dori, said the idea had some merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want alcohol advertised but yeah, I'd consider
it,'' Ramiccio said.
</P>
<P>
   To make the pitch more palatable to cities queasy about the
overt commercialism, Dori says every ad will carry a reminder not
to litter or to avoid trampling sea turtle nests. He says the
billboards are win-win deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only taking this to beaches that are high traffic
areas,'' he said. ``As much as anything, it's a public service.''

 &HT;    Mother-daughter feminists still clash over Barbie
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Growing up with a nationally recognized
feminist for a mother, Katie Roiphe had a special perspective on
Barbie dolls and The Brady Bunch, she told a woman's group Monday.
Her mother, author Anne Roiphe, stood beside her at the lectern,
grinning.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather brought us a giant Barbie Beauty Palace,'' said
Roiphe the Younger. ``And we spent a whole day playing with it,
setting up the shampoo machine and the hair dryer and cutting
Barbie's hair. And we went to bed that night and woke up the next
morning, looking forward to this wonderful toy ...
</P>
<P>
   ``And the Barbie Beauty Palace was gone!
</P>
<P>
   ``And we went to my mother and asked her where the Barbie Beauty
Palace was. And she looked at us and said it was lost. This
gigantic thing! It was lost!''
</P>
<P>
   The Barbie Incident still rankled a bit, even years later.
``This Barbie Palace was trash for a very good reason,'' Roiphe the
Elder told the women's group, who turned out to show support for
Israel's Ben-Gurion University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to me wrong at the time to tell little girls they
should be playing with their hair, they should be leaving math
equations alone.''
</P>
<P>
   As for The Brady Bunch, Roiphe permitted her five girls to watch
the show but insisted on ``hovering the entire half hour, telling
us, `Girls shouldn't want to be cheerleaders, girls shouldn't want
to be cheerleaders,''' Katie Roiphe recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The Roiphes (pronounced roy-phees) have written several books
and numerous newspaper and magazine articles exploring the twists
and turns American feminism has taken in the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Roiphe is the author of Up the Sandbox and Fruitful: My
Real Life As A Modern Mother. Katie Roiphe stirred a minor
controversy when she wrote an article for Esquire magazine titled
The Independent Woman And Other Lies, in which she confessed
enjoying having the man pay for dinner on a date.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Roiphe told a lunchtime crowd at Palm Beach's Poinciana
Club that early, radical feminism had erred occasionally, in its
strident militancy. The errors have had surprising after-effects,
she said, including President Clinton's current imbroglio in
Congress over his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began with two slogans that turned out to be completely
mistaken,'' the older Roiphe said. ``One was: `Women need men like
a fish needs a bicycle.' Wonderful statement, but completely
untrue. Women need men for the next generation, and we also have
hormones that make us so we cannot live without men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second slogan was: `The personal is political.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Washington,'' Katie Roiphe interrupted, ``what we're seeing
now is this slogan taken to its astounding, natural extreme. It
started with Clarence Thomas and even before that, when every dirty
joke a man told in the workplace was seen as a political act. The
personal is not political. This is an error of the feminist
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Both women pointed to the president's wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, as a living example of the ambiguities and contradictions
that becloud feminist issues that once seemed crystal-clear. Should
a woman leave, or stay with, an unfaithful husband? Is such
fidelity a sign of weakness?
</P>
<P>
   The Roiphes are undecided but clearly find the first lady
fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us to figure out what we feel about Hillary
at present,'' Anne Roiphe said. ``To some of us she seems extremely
noble, she has a lot of strength. At first she was despised the way
Eleanor Roosevelt was despised. Now she is widely admired and
looked up to. Is it just because she started to stand by her man?''
</P>
<P>
   Katie Roiphe likened the shift in public opinion in Hillary
Clinton's favor, after the scandal broke, to the thawing in British
opinion toward Princess Diana, after she went on television and
confessed she had bulimia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like her because we see weakness. We like her because she
seems vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparks flew at this point. One woman rose to blast Clinton, even
as the plates containing the remains of the poached salmon and
caviar with herbs, which had been served for lunch, were being
cleared away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is emotionally and psychologically abusive to his
wife. I don't see why anybody should be lionized for standing next
to a man who is an icebox. He was unfaithful!'' the attendee
declared.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's name is still one to conjure with: Angry murmurs
and even shushes could be heard as the woman spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say that I agree with you that I would not want to
be married to the man,'' Katie Roiphe replied. ``But I do see some
strand of something that is romantic in this relationship. I think
she really loves him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Lady Bird Johnson once said of Lyndon Johnson: `My husband
loves all the world's people, and half the world's people are
women.'''
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon raised at least $100,000 for the Ben-Gurion
University medical school in one fell swoop: Retired biochemist Meg
Kramer, a well-known Palm Beach philanthropist, pledged the sum
after hearing Dr. Rivka Carmi describe how the university, which is
located at the edge of the vast Negev Desert in southern Israel, is
working to improve women's health, not only among Jews but among
Bedouin women.

MOMENTS OF THE HEART: THE STORIES BEHIND HOLLYWOOD'S FAVORITE LOVE
SCENES 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a color slide of Michelle Pfeiffer and Jeff Bridges in a
scene from ``The Fabulous Baker Boys.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Love scenes mean never having to say you're sorry.
 &HT;    Except when your elbow blocks someone's closeup. Or you're
rubbing your co-star's lips raw by take 30.
 &HT;    Or if you're curled up in a car trunk with George Clooney and
having major leg cramps, as Jennifer Lopez learned making ``Out of
Sight'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``After 45 takes,'' she says, ``I was praying, `Please, let all
this cuddling be over.'''
 &HT;    In reality, not all of the movies' most celebrated love scenes
were all that romantic, at least to the stars who made them. 
 -0- 
 ``PRETTY WOMAN'' (1990)  
 &HT;    The scene: A wealthy businessman (Richard Gere) and his
enchanting hooker (Julia Roberts) relax in the tub in his luxury
hotel suite.
 &HT;    ``The bathtub scene wasn't as fun as it looked,'' Roberts
recalls. ``No one wants to spend a day in water, even if it's with
Richard Gere. Your body stocking is pinching. At one point I'm
lathering up Richard's chest for the 20th time and he goes, `Julia,
my skin is cracking open. You've got to stop using the soap on
me.'''
 ``DIRTY DANCING'' (1987)  
 &HT;    The scene: A poor dance instructor (Patrick Swayze) and a rich
college girl (Jennifer Grey) crawl passionately toward one another
across the floor of a Catskills dance studio.
 &HT;    ``A few days before we did the scene, my knee mysteriously
filled with fluid,'' Swayze says. ``I had to have it drained with a
needle. Needless to say, it was no picnic crawling on it. I might
look like I'm happy and in love, but I was in horrible pain.''
 ``A STAR IS BORN'' (1976)  
 &HT;    The scene: A singer on his way down (Kris Kristofferson) and his
wife, a singer on her way up (Barbra Streisand), express their love
in a tub.
 &HT;    ``It's my favorite scene of the film,'' Kristofferson says,
``but it was tough. I remember our producer, Jon Peters, was also
Barbra's boyfriend at the time. He wanted me to wear a wetsuit in
the tub _ I guess he was jealous. I would have been jealous of me,
too.
 &HT;    ``In the end, I did wear some boxer shorts in the tub. It's
disappointing, because it would be a better story if I wore
nothing.''
 ``BULL DURHAM'' (1988)  
 &HT;    The scene: An aging baseball player (Kevin Costner) and a
philosophical fan (Susan Sarandon) finally get up close and
personal with each other.
 &HT;    ``We approached these scenes from a perspective of fun,''
Sarandon says with a laugh. ``Kevin and I knew we had to have movie
sex in a tub, sex on the kitchen table and so on. We wanted to look
like it was the best time in our lives.
 &HT;    ``I remember being nervous and hoping he moved in the right
angles to hide parts of my body.''
 ``THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY'' (1995)  
 &HT;    The scene: An Iowa housewife (Meryl Streep) and her photographer
lover (Clint Eastwood) realize that she can never leave her family.
On his way out of town, they spot each other and gaze longingly
across the road neither will cross.
 &HT;    ``It's my favorite scene,'' Streep says. ``I remember we shot it
in the rain. Clint is standing there with his hair plastered to his
forehead, and the entire time I was wishing the script could change
and my character would go to him.
 &HT;    ``But that would have ruined the movie.''
 ``OUT OF SIGHT'' (1998)  
 &HT;    The scene: A fugitive (George Clooney) breaks out of jail,
stuffs a federal marshall (Jennifer Lopez) in the trunk of the
getaway car and slips in next to her. His buddy drives off, leaving
the two to get acquainted.
 &HT;    ``We did 45 takes, which took two days,'' Lopez says. ``What I
remember the most is that I could curl up like that for about four
hours and then I needed a break. I needed to stretch.''
 &HT;    Clooney has a different take on the scene.
 &HT;    ``We rehearsed the scene on the very creaky couch in my office,
which was fun,'' he says roguishly. ``Later, it was funny because
we had to do reshoots on the trunk scene. I was like, `Yes! Yes!
Yes!'
 &HT;    ``Then I said, `Really? That's too bad.'''
 ``AS GOOD AS IT GETS'' (1997)  
 &HT;    The scene: Nasty Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) finally softens,
telling his might-be girlfriend (Helen Hunt) why they belong
together: ``You make me want to be a better man.''
 &HT;    ``I loved doing this scene,'' Nicholson says. ``We didn't have
to do too many takes, but I remember thinking, `This is one of the
most beautiful things I've ever heard one human being say to
another.'''
 &HT;    Hunt agrees: ``I teared up for real every time he said the
line.''
 ``THE MASK OF ZORRO'' (1998)  
 &HT;    The scene: The dashing Zorro (Antonio Banderas) matches swords
with a beautiful maiden (Catherine Zeta Jones) and, in the
processes, whittles away at her dress until it finally comes off.
 &HT;    ``My dress was attached by wires,'' Jones recalls. ``All of a
sudden someone offstage pulled a string and, whoosh, I was almost
nude. Antonio had this devastating smirk the entire time.''
 &HT;    ``The only bad part is that Catherine slashed my back a little
bit during the scene,'' Banderas adds jokingly. ``Also, I came home
and told my wife, Melanie Griffith, about it and ... well, I still
have the bruise.''
 ``THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS'' (1989)  
 &HT;    The scene: A sultry singer (Michelle Pfeiffer) slithers across a
piano singing ``Makin' Whoopee'' to her handsome pianist (Jeff
Bridges).
 &HT;    ``I thought that either I would look like the biggest fool alive
or the scene would be cinematically great,'' Pfeiffer says. ``I
trusted the director, who said, `I promise I won't make you look
like a fool.' I said, `But I'm standing on top of a piano. How can
I not look like a fool?'
 &HT;    ``Plus that dress was very slippery. I was worried about falling
off the piano, which thankfully didn't happen.''
 ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE'' (1998)  
 &HT;    The scene: The Bard (Joseph Fiennes) and his lady love (Gwyneth
Paltrow) spend a day in bed, reading to each other from his new
play, ``Romeo and Juliet.''
 &HT;    ``I remember thinking during the filming that we were getting
it,'' Paltrow recalls. ``We were conveying the passions of these
people in a beautiful, seamless way.''
 &HT;    Fiennes takes a less romantic view, however.
 &HT;    ``Oh, it wasn't as glamorous as one might think,'' he says.
``Let's start with the fact that Gwyneth's boyfriend, Ben Affleck,
is in the movie, and he's a big guy. You don't want to get on the
wrong side of Ben and say, `Guess what? I will be spending the
duration of the day in bed with your girlfriend.''
 ``PRETTY IN PINK'' (1986)  
 &HT;    The scene: The high-school prom. The poor girl (Molly Ringwald)
dances with the school geek (Jon Cryer) who's always been madly in
love with her.
 &HT;    ``The day we shot the big dance scene I had the flu,'' Ringwald
says. ``Every single time poor Jon would twirl me around, I would
have to say, `Excuse me.' Then I would run in the corner and throw
up. It wasn't exactly romantic.''
 ``JERRY MAGUIRE'' (1996)  
 &HT;    The scene: A sports agent (Tom Cruise) returns to his estranged
wife (Renee Zellweger) and tells her, ``You complete me.''
 &HT;    ``The day Tom looked in my eyes and said that line was
fantastic,'' Zellweger says. ``We did 15 takes. When it was over, I
was actually shaking.
 &HT;    ``I remember I sat down in this fake kitchen and Tom came in. He
sat down next to me and smiled, and then said, `Renee, just think _
we'll be together forever.'
 &HT;    ``Of course, he meant on the screen.''

`ER'S' GEORGE CLOONEY ANSWERS HIS FINAL CALL 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a color slide of George Clooney in a scene from ``ER.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As he prepares to leave NBC's hit series ``ER,'' George Clooney
is being showered with praise for his acting abilities. After all,
dozens of critics say, it's his talent more than anything else
which has made the show television's highest-rated drama.
</P>
<P>
   Just don't expect him to agree. When I interviewed Clooney in
his trailer outside the ``ER'' soundstage a couple of years ago, he
did his best to convince me he wasn't much of an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an actor, I'm somewhat of a hack,'' he said, perfectly
seriously. ``I find myself stealing from the actors that I really
like, as opposed to coming up with interesting choices of my own.
The truth is, you don't have to be a great actor on a show that's
this well written.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled appearing on stage before an audience which included
his uncle, Oscar-winning actor/director Jose Ferrer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crying and yelling and spitting and doing everything in
it,'' Clooney said. ``Jose was sitting in the back, and afterward I
went to him and said, `What do you think?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said, `Get the scenery out of your mouth, you don't
know where it's been!'''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney freely admitted that the constraints of a television
production schedule make series acting much different from film or
stage work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're working on a TV series and a director comes in,
you can't really do what they tell you,'' he said. ``They come on
the show and want to make their episode something special _ `This
is the one where Dr. Ross cries.' But you can't do every one of
those. So you learn how to direct yourself and not pay attention to
the director.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll say, `Do it this way,' and you'll say, `Yeah, yeah,
yeah' _ and you'll do it your way, and everything is moving too
fast for them to notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing it his way has worked out for Clooney. He's leaving ``ER''
to focus on a film career which so far has drawn critical praise
more often than box-office gold.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for Dr. Ross to have a memorable death scene, a la
Det. Bobby Simone's much-hyped departure from ``NYPD Blue'' in fall
1998. Clooney isn't burning any bridges _ he's already made it
known that he's up for an occasional return to the series. There
may be a few golden eggs left in the proverbial goose, and the
canny Clooney isn't ruling anything out.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, executive producer John Wells has opted not to make
the actor's departure part of any sort of season-ending
cliff-hanger, but to incorporate it into the season's natural arc
of stories, much as the series did when Sherry Stringfield left
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney comes by that show-business savvy naturally. He hails
from a show-business family _ besides Ferrer, singer Rosemary
Clooney is his aunt and actor/television host Nick Clooney is his
father _ and has paid his Hollywood dues. Before scoring with
``ER,'' he had done his share of failed pilots, had been jettisoned
from 1990's ``Baby Talk'' before it even hit the air and had done
time as a supporting player on a few successful series, ``The Facts
of Life,'' ``Roseanne'' and ``Sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   So he came in knowing how Hollywood works, how something as
simple as a lucky break or a good time slot can make the difference
between obscurity and global stardom, and he was able to maximize
the benefits of his success on ``ER,'' neither bailing out at the
first opportunity _ as, for example, David Caruso did with ``NYPD
Blue'' _ nor staying so long on the series that it stifled his
big-screen potential.
</P>
<P>
   And to date ``potential'' is the key word for Clooney's career
as a movie star.
</P>
<P>
   His two most impressive performances _ opposite Michelle
Pfeiffer in the slight-but-charming romantic comedy ``One Fine
Day'' (1996) and as a raffish criminal in ``Out of Sight'' (1998) _
both suffered from bad timing: The former was bulldozed at the box
office by Tom Cruise's ``Jerry Maguire,'' which was released a week
later, while ``Out of Sight'' was a subtle, intricately paced crime
comedy/drama that foundered amid the leviathans of summer 1998.
</P>
<P>
   His other films have been less distinguished. ``The Peacemaker''
(1997) was a turgid political thriller, heavy on technobabble and
light on chemistry between Clooney and co-star Nicole Kidman.
``From Dusk Till Dawn'' (1997) was a cheesy B movie _ one with some
style, but a cheesy B movie nonetheless _ while ``Batman &AMP; Robin''
(1997) was a brain-dead behemoth swamped in the kind of lavish
special effects that are antithetical to an actor like Clooney,
whose appeal lies in his relaxed, easygoing charm.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the stakes are high as he leaves ``ER.'' His viability as
a leading man will probably be determined by his first couple of
post-television films, which makes it all the more troubling that
he isn't sure exactly what they'll be.
</P>
<P>
   Recently ``Leatherheads,'' an early-days-of-football piece that
would have reunited him with ``Out of Sight'' director Steven
Soderbergh, was cancelled before it went into production.
</P>
<P>
   He's currently working on ``Three Kings,'' a film about a trio
of Gulf War soldiers with a little time on their hands who decide
to hunt for a lost gold reserve. His unlikely co-stars include
rapper/model-turned-actor Mark Wahlberg and rapper Ice Cube. Behind
the camera is David O. Russell, who wrote and directed Ben
Stiller's knockabout, love-hurts comedy, ``Flirting with Disaster''
(1996).
</P>
<P>
   Shrewdly, however, Clooney is hedging his bets. He may be
dreaming of movie stardom, but he's keeping his hand in on the
television front as well. His production company is developing
``Blood Brothers,'' an hour-long mob drama, for CBS, as well as
``Double Helix,'' a drama written by Mike Werb and Michael
Colleary, who wrote ``Face/Off'' (1997).
</P>
<P>
   The actor also has a production deal with HBO and Warner Bros.
Television, which produces ``ER,'' to mount ``Kilroy,'' a
laugh-track-free comedy in which a fictional aspiring actor will
visit the sets of real-life television shows. His fictional
``gigs'' will be actual appearances on the real shows _ a
mind-bending wrinkle reminiscent of ``The Larry Sanders Show,''
which clearly appeals to Clooney.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he's fascinated by the retro-possibilities of live
television. Clooney was one of the principal movers behind ``ER's''
famous live episode, and has several live television movies in the
works for CBS. Possible subjects include a remake of Sidney Lumet's
``Fail-Safe'' (1964) and ``Murrow and Me,'' a biography of the
famed television-journalism pioneer Edward R. Murrow. He plans to
appear in the former, and perhaps in the latter as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``ER,'' Clooney's departure comes at an awkward time, the
same season that NBC agreed to break the bank and fork over a
not-even-close-to-precedented $13 million an episode.
</P>
<P>
   The show's biggest star will not be replaced, at least not in so
many words. The series' ratings have remained strong, and the
producers will play up existing characters and story lines rather
than importing a new actor or an established star to take up
Clooney's slack.
</P>
<P>
   Noah Wyle would seem to be the biggest benefactor of Clooney's
exit, which leaves open the position of resident hunk. But don't
count out Eriq La Salle, who has never gotten the attention that
the caliber of his performances ought to warrant. That may be
changing, however _ the week after Clooney leaves, ``ER'' will
showcase La Salle in one of those periodic episodes that focuses on
one character.
</P>
<P>
   In short, fans of ``ER'' and of George Clooney need not worry,
at least initially. Neither the series' staying power nor the
actor's career shows much sign of a weakening pulse.

THE TWO AND ONLY: TONY RANDALL AND JACK KLUGMAN ARE BACK ON
`BROTHER'S KEEPER' 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a color slide of Tony Randall and Jack Klugman with
William Ragsdale and Sean O'Bryan in a scene from ``Brother's
Keeper.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Call it a two-for-one sale _ two great actors, that is, for one
terrific team.
 &HT;    Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are used to working in tandem. The
two are old pals, not to mention co-stars not only of television's
beloved series ``The Odd Couple'' (1970-1975) and a 1993 reunion
telemovie, but also of numerous stage plays and television
commercials.
 &HT;    On Feb. 19 they'll be back, turning up in the ABC sitcom
``Brother's Keeper,'' in a episode entitled ``An Odd Couple of
Days.''
 &HT;    What convinced them to agree to this latest pairing?
 &HT;    ``That's easy,'' Randall says by telephone from his New York
apartment.
 &HT;    ``A lot of money,'' Klugman says by telephone from his Los
Angeles home.
 &HT;    Ba-da-bing!
 &HT;    ``For television, we actually don't get that many offers to work
together,'' the 76-year-old Klugman says more seriously, his voice
still hoarse after a successful battle with throat cancer. ``Tony
and I work together mostly in the theater.
 &HT;    ``In this case,'' he says, ``the show's producer, Jonathan
Axelrod, was the son of a friend of Tony's. He gave us carte
blanche in terms of improvising and doing anything we wanted. That
made it very attractive.''
 &HT;    Randall, who will turn 79 on Feb. 26, interrupts.
 &HT;    ``Jack put his finger on it right away,'' he says. ``They paid
us a lot of money.''
 &HT;    And the two share a laugh.
 &HT;    For those not familiar with ``Brother's Keeper,'' it's a sitcom
nestled in ABC's family-friendly Friday-night schedule. The show
revolves around 8-year-old Oscar (Justin Cooper), who lives with
his straitlaced father (William Ragsdale) and his father's brother
(Sean O'Bryan), a likable but chronically reckless sports star.
 &HT;    In the upcoming episode, Ragsdale and O'Bryan encounter Klugman
and Randall, who play bickering brothers-in-law, and wonder if
they're seeing their own future before them.
 &HT;    ``It'll be familiar stuff,'' Randall says. ``We play characters
people are pretty accustomed to seeing us play. We get into
struggles and we fight.''
 &HT;    The episode marks the first time in 24 years that Klugman and
Randall have teamed for a sitcom.
 &HT;    ``It was 1975 that we finished `The Odd Couple,''' Randall says.
``But it's really like riding a bike when Jack and I work together.
We did long runs of `Odd Couple' as a play, and we did `The
Sunshine Boys' for eight months last year, a good part of that on
Broadway. We work together frequently.''
 &HT;    ``As often as we can,'' Klugman says.
 &HT;    Some actors have resisted being paired with the same performer
too often _ Richard Burton famously warned Elizabeth Taylor that he
didn't want them to turn into Laurel and Hardy _ but Randall and
Klugman don't mind at all.
 &HT;    ``We work well together,'' Randall says. ``I guess that's
obvious. It's a pleasure to work with Jack.''
 &HT;    ``We appreciate each other,'' Klugman says. ``We work the same
way. It's good to work together a lot, because you get to know the
other person.
 &HT;    ``You get a sense of comfort, but also a spontaneity that you
can spark in each other,'' he adds. ``On stage, we're confident we
can do anything, and we know the other guy will be there to support
it.''
 &HT;    ``And there's no competition between us,'' Randall says.
 &HT;    ``It's very, very rare,'' Klugman concludes, ``to find someone
you can act with who makes you feel so comfortable.''
 &HT;    Randall's career dates back to 1941 and his stage debut in the
play ``The Circle of Chalk.'' His numerous subsequent credits
include the movies ``Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?'' (1957),
three Doris Day-Rock Hudson outings and ``The King of Comedy''
(1983). On television he's starred in ``Mr. Peepers'' (1952-1955)
and ``Love, Sidney'' (1981-1983), while on the stage he's appeared
in everything from ``The Music Man'' to ``M. Butterfly.''
 &HT;    Since 1991, Randall has immersed himself in his dream project,
The National Actors Theatre, a not-for-profit company that stages a
variety of shows each season.
 &HT;    Klugman launched his career in 1949 opposite Rod Steiger in the
play ``Stevedore,'' and subsequently appeared in ``Mr. Roberts''
and ``Gypsy,'' as well as a 1998 production of ``Death of a
Salesman'' in Los Angeles. His films include ``12 Angry Men''
(1957), ``Days of Wine and Roses'' (1962) and ``Dear God'' (1996).
 &HT;    On television, Klugman acted in several classic episodes of
``The Twilight Zone,'' starred as the title character in ``Quincy,
M.E.'' (1976-1983) and won an Emmy for a 1964 appearance on ``The
Defenders.''
 &HT;    And, along the way, they met each other.
 &HT;    ``We met doing a show people mention frequently,'' Randall says,
deadpan. ``I bet people think of it all the time.''
 &HT;    He and Klugman crack up.
 &HT;    ``It was called `Appointment with Adventure,''' Randall says.
``That was sometime in the last century.''
 &HT;    ``It was 1954,'' Klugman says. ``It was a summer replacement.
Shows would play all winter, and in the summer a stock company
would come in with a replacement.
 &HT;    ``Who was in it with us, Tony?''
 &HT;    ``Gena Rowlands,'' Randall says. ``She was the only good thing
in it.''
 &HT;    Klugman laughs.
 &HT;    ``It was terrible,'' he says. ``Terrible.''
 &HT;    ``Jack played a gangster and I was a professor,'' Randall says.
``It was really bad.''
 &HT;    It never occurred to either actor that, 45 years later, they'd
still be friends, still sharing the stage and screen.
 &HT;    ``No, no, no,'' they say simultaneously.
 &HT;    ``We didn't see each other for almost 20 years after that
show,'' Klugman says. ``Until we did `Odd Couple.'''
 &HT;    Airing from 1970 to 1975, ``The Odd Couple'' cemented the
perception of Randall and Klugman as comedians. Both men swear,
rather unconvincingly, that the label doesn't bother them.
 &HT;    ``Whatever the public likes is fine,'' Randall says. ``They
decide, but we know better.''
 &HT;    ``In the final analysis,'' Klugman adds, ``you can get
categorized, but if you categorize yourself or put yourself in a
pigeonhole, then you become that type.
 &HT;    ``When I was up for `Odd Couple,''' he recalls, ``they said to
Garry Marshall, `But he only does drama. He can't do comedy.' Then
when I was doing `Quincy' they said, `He only does comedy. He can't
do drama.' You can't listen to anything they say.''
 &HT;    ``People only remember the last thing they saw,'' Randall says.
``That's not only the public, it's the people who give jobs. And
it'll never change.
 &HT;    ``After I did `The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao'' (1964),'' he
recalls, ``I was offered nothing but ancient Orientals! It sounds
ridiculous, but it's true. For one of the movies I couldn't do they
got John Gielgud _ I've always liked that.''
 &HT;    ``I never knew that, Tony,'' Klugman says, chuckling. ``Look,
it's just a way of a studio protecting itself, protecting its
dollars.''
 &HT;    Randall and Klugman are both busy with a variety of activities.
Randall, the father of a 2-year-old daughter and an 8-month-old
son, is gearing up for the National Actors Theatre production of
``The Night Must Fall,'' starring Matthew Broderick. Klugman, the
father of two grown sons, hopes to star soon in a two-hour
``Quincy'' movie for television.
 &HT;    Later this year, the two will return to the stage for a
production of Tom Stoppard's ``Rough Crossing.'' If a Florida
tryout proves popular, they'll take the show to Broadway.
 &HT;    ``We've actually found two or three plays we might do in the
future,'' Randall says. ``The public likes to see us together, it
seems. That's good, because Jack and I like to work together.''
 &HT;    ``We've got a good thing going,'' Klugman says. ``Why stop
now?''

MEN ARE FROM MARS, ELIZABETH HURLEY IS FROM VENUS 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a color slide of Elizabeth Hurley with Jeff Daniels in a
scene from ``My Favorite Martian.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF and SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Elizabeth Hurley isn't always as sexy as she looks in those
television commercials.
 &HT;    If you're in any doubt, check out her latest film, ``My Favorite
Martian,'' opening Feb. 12. The adaptation of the old television
series features Hurley and a great deal of mugging _ or, as she and
other Brits call it, ``pulling faces.''
 &HT;    ``I went to a screening this week, and I found myself quite
frightening,'' she says. ``I make those faces all the time in real
life, and now I realize what I must look like. From now on I'm
going to try to imagine that my features are frozen so I'll never
pull another face again.''
 &HT;    Director Dan Petrie has praised Hurley's willingness to set
aside her supermodel image to deliver the kind of off-the-wall
performance the film required.
 &HT;    ``I think you just have to throw away your inhibitions,'' she
says with a shrug. ``Otherwise every day on that set would have
been excruciating. If you get self-conscious, you're a goner. You
just have to close your eyes, take a deep breath and say to
yourself, `OK, get silly!'''
 &HT;    One particularly silly scene finds Hurley possessed by the title
alien, to the point of sprouting tentacles.
 &HT;    ``I practiced alone in my trailer for that scene,'' she admits.
``But occasionally Chris Lloyd, who plays the Martian, would come
by to give me a few tips. That was actually a nightmare, because
there I was, contorting my body for this brilliant comedian while
he was critiquing me.''
 &HT;    Hurley's character is an obnoxious television reporter, but she
denies modeling her on any single real person.
 &HT;    ``I can tell you it was not Barbara Walters,'' the actress says
with a laugh. ``Actually, it was sort of my revenge on some of the
reporters who've tortured me in interviews over the years. I just
sort of made a composite of all the worst so-called journalists
I've had to face, and there was my character.
 &HT;    ``It was actually quite liberating to play someone so beastly,''
she adds. ``Normally you get so obsessed with making yourself
charming and likable _ it was actually quite nice to forget all
that and just be a cow.''
 &HT;    There's nothing noticeably bovine about Hurley as she relaxes in
a Hollywood hotel suite. Her stunning beauty is set off by a pair
of tightfitting leather jeans and a form-hugging black sweater.
 &HT;    ``Normally it takes me a few good hours of hair and makeup to
look good on camera,'' she insists. ``People who see me looking
groomed and perfect in those cosmetics commercials don't realize
how much work it takes. In real life I like to dress down.
 &HT;    ``Actually, I think being pretty can sometimes be a liability,''
she adds. ``People think you're not very smart or interesting.
 &HT;    ``I fell into that trap the other day,'' Hurley admits.
``Somebody was talking about a very handsome actor for a dramatic
part, and I made a face. I realized I was thinking, `He's probably
too gorgeous to have any depth.' That's a hideously unfair
assumption _ it's absolute rubbish that people who look good can't
be clever.''
 &HT;    The actress has spent the last couple of years working to prove
that she's more than a pretty face. She and her longtime boyfriend,
actor Hugh Grant, have their own production company, Simian
Productions. They produced ``Extreme Measures,'' which fizzled at
the box office in 1997, and have another coming later this year.
 &HT;    ``It's called `Mickey Blue Eyes,''' she says. ``It's sort of a
romantic comedy about the Mafia. Hugh is the leading man, and he's
very, very funny in it. I think it's his best acting in a long
time. He spends half the movie trying to become a New York
goodfella with some help from James Caan, but he just can't get it
together.
 &HT;    ``Being a producer is not nearly as cushy as being an actor,''
Hurley adds with a laugh. ``When you're acting, you do your 10
weeks' work and get spoiled rotten, and very well paid to boot.
When I'm producing I spend a lot of time taking care of those perks
for my stars, and I don't get any.
 &HT;    ``But I love having the control over what we're doing. If things
don't work out you have no one to blame but yourself, and I rather
like that.''
 &HT;    When they aren't working, Hurley says, she and Grant hardly lead
glamorous lives.
 &HT;    ``We don't actually go out that much at the moment,'' she says,
``but I don't sit at home and watch TV, either. I don't have a set.
I probably haven't watched an entire program in 25 years _ I just
don't have the patience to sit still that long.''
 &HT;    The two spend much of the year in Los Angeles, but Hurley misses
her native Britain.
 &HT;    ``There's no street life here,'' she says. ``Nobody walks around
or sits at an outdoor cafe or anything. But I do find that I have a
little more privacy here. If you think the tabloid press is bad in
Hollywood, you should go to London _ the English press is insane.''
 &HT;    Few have endured the kind of press blitz that Grant and Hurley
faced after his 1995 arrest for soliciting a prostitute, and Hurley
says that she's still dealing with the consequences.
 &HT;    ``You have to be careful not to cocoon yourself,'' she says.
``Suddenly you find you're missing out on life. You say to
yourself, `I want to sit at a sidewalk cafe and watch people pass
by, because that was one of the favorite things that I ever did.'
You start to do your own grocery shopping again, just because it
feels weird not to do what normal people do.
 &HT;    ``Gradually you find a way to live with people staring at you
and stuff, as long as you feel safe. I live much more normally now
than I did a couple of years ago.''
 &HT;    Looking ahead, Hurley denies any master plan behind her rather
eclectic choice of projects.
 &HT;    ``I kind of look at a stack of scripts in the office and take
what seems best and right to do at the moment,'' she says,
laughing. ``However, I do get bored when I see a part that begins,
`A beautiful girl pulls up in a sports car, gets out and takes off
her dark glasses.' That's when I hear a voice in my head saying, `I
don't think so.'''
 &HT;    Next up is a cameo appearance in the sequel to ``Austin Powers:
International Man of Mystery,'' her surprise hit of 1997.
 &HT;    ``I wasn't disappointed that I don't last for the whole movie,''
she says. ``Austin Powers is like James Bond, he wants a new Pussy
Galore in every film. Anyway, the original was such a huge hit that
it gave my career a tremendous boost.
 &HT;    ``What's strange is, I get all these little boys coming up to me
wherever I go who loved the movie,'' she adds. ``They want me in a
silver miniskirt. It's a little bizarre, but quite cute.''
 &HT;    Those young fans don't get her thinking about a family of her
own, though.
 &HT;    ``My sister has two children, and I've become an extremely good
aunt,'' she says. ``I was a bit scared of them at first _ I didn't
have the faintest idea of how to talk to them. But now I'm
absolutely in love with them.''
 &HT;    Hurley pulls a face.
 &HT;    ``I don't think I'm quite ready to be a mother myself,'' she
adds. ``I don't think I'm that responsible. But, you know,
gradually I am getting more grown up.''

 &HT;    Mini reviews if movies released on video
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Rounders'' (R) _ The snappy dialogue, Matt Damon's star
presence and John Malkovich's over-the-top Russian accent are the
main reasons to see this high-stakes gambling drama. Damon plays a
law student and card sharp trying to go the straight and narrow.
Edward Norton plays his unreliable friend, Worm. Problem is, Worm
is such a loser, we start to lose sympathy for Damon, whose loyalty
verges on self-destructive. Other minuses: A hypocritical,
mixed-message ending and whiny, blank Gretchen Mol as Damon's
girlfriend. (Famke Janssen, in a small role as one of his old
flames, blows her right out of the water.) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Clay Pigeons'' (R) _ The latest Tarantino/Coen brothers
clone, mixing serial killers, small-town crackers and general bad
taste. Joaquin Phoenix plays a guy who gets mixed up in the bloody
hobby of giggling psycho Vince Vaughn (who's very good). Janeane
Garofalo is also her reliably dry, sly self as a federal agent
tracking the killer. But the movie stumbles over a few too many
improbably plot twists. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Next Stop, Wonderland'' (R) _ A small wonder in its own
modest way. This charming low-budget romantic comedy about the
relationship travails of a Boston nurse (Hope Davis) is stronger on
character nuance than on plot; in fact, filmmaker Brad Anderson
loads it with too much plot. But by applying a naturalistic
independent film sensibility to a vintage glossy Hollywood
predicament, he comes out ahead. Think of a film where John
Cassavetes shares pillow talk with Doris Day. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   _ Eleanor Ringel
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Underground'' (unrated) _ Emir Kusturica's exhausting,
three-hour epic examines the recent history of what was once
Yugoslavia with his usual mix of exuberance, humor and surreal
imagery. Spanning 50 years and three kinds of war, the film starts
in 1941, setting up the love triangle involving Marko (Miki
Manojlovic), his best pal Blacky (Lazar Ristovski) and Blacky's
mistress, Natalija (Mirjana Jokovic). The film leaps 20 years
forward to find Blacky and dozens of others hiding in a basement,
convinced by Marko (now Natalija's lover) that Germany is
undefeated. From there the film leaps another 30 years, to the
Bosnian conflict, where the comic tone sours into bleak, bloody
absurdity. ``Underground'' changes moods constantly, ranging from
the heartbreaking bombing of a zoo, to an image of heaven that's
beautifully rooted in the Slavic soil. Grade: A-

 &HT;    Bugging out to his own beat
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Antz'' (PG)
</P>
<P>
   When our nebbishy hero, Z, frets to his shrink about his
insecurity, the voice is instantly recognizable as Woody Allen's.
The body isn't. Sporting six legs, a set of antennae and a bulbous
posterior, Z looks exactly like his gazillion neighbors in this
totalitarian ant colony. But he's about to make a very distinct
impression, as he literally decides to walk (and dance) to his own
beat.
</P>
<P>
   This visually remarkable, computer-animated feature, like ``Toy
Story,'' finds witty human satire in the least human places.
</P>
<P>
   But the script tends to be by-the-numbers predictable in its
fable about nonconformity and heroism. It doesn't help that almost
all of the characters look identical. Grade: B

 &HT;    And the Oscar goes (or should have gone) to . . .
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The announcement of the Oscar nominations this week reminds us
that some of the most famous movies Hollywood ever made didn't make
the cut for best picture the year they were eligible. Consider
these titles, none of them nominees: ``City Lights,'' ``Young Mr.
Lincoln,'' ``Bringing Up Baby,'' ``King Kong,'' ``The Public
Enemy,'' ``The Women,'' ``Modern Times,'' ``Little Caesar,'' ``The
Bride of Frankenstein,'' ``The Blue Angel,'' ``My Man Godfrey,''
``Nothing Sacred'' and ``Intermezzo.'' And those are just from the
'30s. Here are some other what-were-they-thinking omissions:
</P>
<P>
   The '40s
</P>
<P>
   And the Nominee Wasn't:
</P>
<P>
   ``His Girl Friday'' (1940)
</P>
<P>
   This whip-smart reworking of Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's
famous newspaper play, ``The Front Page,'' got its inspiration at a
dinner party attended by director Howard Hawks. He had a young
woman read the part of reporter Hildy Johnson and he read the part
of Hildy's editor, Walter Burns. He then called up Hecht and said,
``What do you think about changing Hildy Johnson and making her a
girl?'' Hecht replied, ``I wish we'd thought of that.'' Not just
any girl, however. Rosalind Russell is at her fast-talking best as
Hildy, and Cary Grant is at his Cary Grant best as Burns. Hawks got
used to being snubbed by the academy. His classics ``The Big
Sleep'' and ``Red River'' were also ignored in the best picture
category.
</P>
<P>
   The '50s
</P>
<P>
   And the Nominee Wasn't:
</P>
<P>
   ``The African Queen'' (1951)
</P>
<P>
   The stars, Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn, were nominated
(Bogart won). So was the director, John Huston. But the movie
itself, a shamelessly entertaining opposites-attract tale about a
gin-soaked river rat (Bogart) and a prim missionary (Hepburn) going
downriver to elude the Germans, wasn't deemed as ``important'' as
the quasi-biblical epic ``Quo Vadis,'' which got a best picture
nomination. But then, the '50s were famous for that kind of
thinking. In 1954, ``Three Coins in the Fountain'' was considered
worthier than ``A Star Is Born'' or ``Rear Window.'' In 1955,
``Love Is a Many Splendored Thing'' was chosen over ``Rebel Without
a Cause.'' Ditto ``The Ten Commandments'' and ``Friendly
Persuasion'' over ``The Searchers'' (1956).
</P>
<P>
   The '60s
</P>
<P>
   And the Nominee Wasn't:
</P>
<P>
   ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1968)
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Kubrick's sci-fi mind-bender starts with apes and an
enigmatic obelisk and ends with a psychedelic orgasm and an
enigmatic embryo. In between, there are waltzing space stations,
``The Blue Danube'' and, of course, HAL the computer, who has
become a part of our culture (what other movie icon from the '60s
had a cameo in a recent Super Bowl commercial?) Maybe the film's
``stoner'' reputation scared off the academy. Ironic, considering
that, 30 years later, ``2001'' is on the pope's list of recommended
movies. Meanwhile, back in '68, with America going to hell in a
handbasket _ assassinations, protests, riots _ Hollywood decided to
accentuate the positive and nominate, not one, but two musicals:
``Funny Girl'' and ``Oliver!'' (the eventual winner).
</P>
<P>
   The '70s
</P>
<P>
   And the Nominee Wasn't:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mean Streets'' (1973)
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring Martin Scorsese's phenomenal early feature was just the
beginning of a long-standing Mexican standoff between one of our
greatest directors and the Academy Awards. Scorsese is the only
member of the '70s new wave (which ranges from Francis Ford Coppola
to Steven Spielberg) to never win an Oscar. ``Mean Streets'' may be
rough around the edges, but this story of some Little Italy
small-timers crackles with energy, intelligence and fine acting. It
helped establish careers for Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel and
put Scorsese on the Hollywood map (his next film was the very
conventional ``Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.'') Scorsese would
go on to win his share of nominations _ for ``Raging Bull,'' ``Taxi
Driver'' and ``GoodFellas'' to name a few _ but has yet to go home
a winner.
</P>
<P>
   The '80s
</P>
<P>
   And the Nominee Wasn't:
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Velvet'' (1986)
</P>
<P>
   Academy members had nothing against director David Lynch. They'd
nominated him before for ``The Elephant Man'' in 1980 (in both the
picture and directing categories). But when it came to his
disturbing walk on the wild side of ``See Spot Run'' America _ Kyle
MacLachlan and Laura Dern as amateur sleuths drawn into a nightmare
netherworld of sex, violence and unbridled Dennis Hopper _ the
academy went schizoid. It failed to nominate Lynch's film _ too
malignant, too provocative, too controversial _ but did nominate
Lynch himself for best director. Which meant Randa Haines, the
director of one of the best picture nominees, ``Children of a
Lesser God,'' was left out. Another case of The Movie Directed
Itself.
</P>
<P>
   The '90s
</P>
<P>
   And the Nominee Wasn't:
</P>
<P>
   ``Thelma &AMP; Louise'' (1991)
</P>
<P>
   It was ``The African Queen'' all over again. The stars (Susan
Sarandon and Geena Davis) were nominated. The director (Ridley
Scott) was nominated. The movie was one of the most talked about of
the year with its sexy feminism (an oxymoron according to some).
But while audiences were applauding Sarandon's and Davis'
accidental outlaws, Oscar voters were more comfortable with movies
focusing on lady psychiatrists (``The Prince of Tides'') and FBI
agents (``The Silence of the Lambs''). Sarandon and Davis canceled
each other out, giving ``Silence's'' Jodie Foster her second win.
But the film did take home one Oscar; it went to neophyte Callie
Khouri for best original screenplay. And the long-overdue Sarandon
finally did win an Oscar _ for playing a nun in ``Dead Man
Walking'' (1995).

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Divining for dollars
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share their memories of growing up in small-town
America. Back then, or at least the way we remember it, life was
like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Milton Watts
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   JEFFERSON, Texas _ My ancestors were deep in the Ozarks during
the Civil War. They settled in a community called Richland along
the Buffalo River in Searcy County, Ark. My dad left the Ozarks for
East Texas in 1923. I was born in Texas in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   I still have kin in the Harrison, Ark., area. On visits to see
our folks we always go back to the old homestead sites in the
Richland area. We call it the Old Country.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago my brother and I made an Arkansas trip to visit our
Uncle Jewel Watts. He was, then, running a grocery store in a small
town called St. Joe that was near Richland.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit, Uncle Jewel revealed to us about this ``gift''
he claimed he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys,'' he said, ``I can 'witch' money. Can't everybody do it,
but I've got the electricity for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimming a small forked peach tree limb, he proceeded to
demonstrate, instructing us to take some dimes, quarters and halves
and hide them in little piles in the backyard, out of his sight.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Jewel came out grasping the forks of the peach tree limb
and _ by golly! _ with the limb bobbing and dipping, more times
than not he would find the coins where we had hidden them.
</P>
<P>
   After several demonstrations, my brother and I became excited
about the prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Jewel said, ``Boys, this is big. We can do something with
this.'' And he told us this story:
</P>
<P>
   ``Above Richland, in the Point Peter Mountains, there's this
place called McCutcheon's Gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, during the Civil War, Missouri guerrillas attacked a
company of Yankee soldiers at this gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fought all day. During the night the Yankees pulled out,
leaving an empty payroll wagon and other supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word is that they hid the gold and silver payroll, and it's
never been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the morning we'll take axes, picks and shovels _ I've got
some dynamite _ and we'll go find that Yankee treasure!''
</P>
<P>
   So it was that early the next day, we struck out in Uncle
Jewel's four-wheel drive pickup on our way to McCutcheon's Gap.
</P>
<P>
   It was rough country. Precipitous bluffs bordered either side of
the gap. Boulders and smaller fallen rock crowded the base of the
bluffs.
</P>
<P>
   Not the least bit daunted, we unloaded our gear while Uncle
Jewel trimmed a forked peach tree limb and starting doing his
thing.
</P>
<P>
   For a long while nothing happened. But finally there was some
indication at a pile of smaller rock.
</P>
<P>
   We rolled rock and dug for better than an hour. The limb quit
bobbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not here,'' Uncle Jewel concluded. ``Let's move.''
</P>
<P>
   Caressing the limb, he took a few deep breaths and, right away,
got a strong indication by a boulder at the base of a high cliff.
</P>
<P>
   ``This feels like this is it,'' he exclaimed. ``Let's dynamite
this rock out of the way, dig down and that's where the money will
be!''
</P>
<P>
   As instructed, we dug under the boulder, buried half a stick of
dynamite, lighted the fuse and then ran for cover.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty as you please, the explosion rolled the boulder away, and
we eagerly set to work with picks and shovels.
</P>

THE FUTURE ARRIVES FOR THE `X-FILES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ At the very end of watching the upcoming ``The
X-Files'' episode in my office, I took off my headphones and began
to yell, ``Holy ...''
</P>
<P>
   An immediate cry went up from a co-worker: ``DON'T TELL US!''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about it, I won't.
</P>
<P>
   But for fans who have followed this Byzantine show for almost
six seasons, this is the moment you've been waiting for: answers,
and Mulder's vindication.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's ``The X-Files'' movie, integral to understanding the
show this season, was subtitled: ``Fight the Future.'' Well, the
wait is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future is here,'' Mulder says Sunday, ``and all bets are
off.'' The ``perfect conspiracy with an alien race'' is out in the
open. The door was kicked in this past Sunday with the first of a
two-part episode. This Sunday (9 p.m. EDT on Fox, check local
listings), Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson)
will come storming through.
</P>
<P>
   You will find the answers, too. To what happened to Mulder's
sister. To the background of the Cigarette Smoking Man (``Smokey's
got a name,'' Mulder says). To the agonizing decision made by
members of the Syndicate. To whether Agent Fowley is working for or
against Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   The last episode was titled ``Two Fathers.'' This coming episode
is called ``One Son.'' On Sunday, Mulder will get what he wants.
But he and the viewers are left with the same question: Now what?
</P>
<P>
   There is a built-in caveat for fans of the show: call it the
Christmas Eve factor. While these conspiracy episodes are
well-executed, expect a letdown. The anticipation is always better.
</P>
<P>
   And here is fodder for debate: Will ``The X-Files'' still be
able to do those offbeat, light episodes it has artfully mixed in,
especially as worldwide cataclysm looms? The show that has built a
lasting legacy by piling on more questions than answers, ``The
X-Files'' is an intriguing position.
</P>
<P>
   The show probably has one more season left after this _
creator/executive producer Chris Carter has said repeatedly seven
years was the goal. And even as more within the FBI believe Mulder
_ at one point he turns skeptic and Scully becomes the conspiracist
_ the agent still has the toughest task left: The future. It's
here. And, yes, all bets are off.

   MOUNT VERNON, Va. _ Nearly two centuries have passed since
George Washington _ after being bled by would-be healers and
prophetically reviewing his will _ whispered `` 'tis well'' and
died in an upstairs bedroom of his beloved mansion beside the
Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the bicentennial year of Washington's death on Dec. 14,
1799, the keepers of his historic homestead and his legacy are
fearful that the Father of His Country is being forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The number of visitors to Washington's carefully maintained
plantation has stagnated, and many schoolchildren are shockingly
ignorant about the life and times of the Revolutionary War
commander and the nation's first president, said Michael Quinn,
programs director at Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Today's youngsters don't even know the boyhood legend of young
George declaring ``I cannot tell a lie'' and admitting to chopping
down his father's favorite cherry tree, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask people if they've ever heard of George Washington and
the cherry tree and they say 'No','' marveled Quinn, recalling the
familiar but apocryphal tale.
</P>
<P>
   So, seeking to restore Washington to his traditional place of
``first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his
countrymen,'' the directors of Mount Vernon have begun a $3 million
campaign to spread his story far and wide during the bicentennial
year of his death.
</P>
<P>
   The effort features new programs, a re-enactment of his funeral
at Mount Vernon and a traveling exhibit of 100 artifacts ranging
from his infamous false teeth (made of ivory, not wood) to a
miniature replica of his home. This ``Only in 1799'' collection
will be at the Atlanta History Center from Oct. 14, 1999, until
Jan. 6, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers also have set up new Internet web sites
(www.gwashington1999.org and www.mountvernon.org) and contacted
communities across the country about staging their own
commemorations.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Vernon's bicentennial events officially opened on
Presidents Day (Washington's real 267th birthday is tomorrow) and
will continue into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to create a nationwide buzz about George Washington,
Quinn explained.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Washington's death, there was a remarkable
outpouring of emotion throughout the new nation. President John
Adams _ Washington's successor _ issued a proclamation that every
American wear a black armband for 30 days and most of the citizens
willingly complied, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   The Daughters of the American Revolution later did an historic
fashion study that showed most American women wore black mourning
dresses throughout the year of 1800, he said. Over 150 communities
staged their own funerals for this first national hero.
</P>
<P>
   The official funeral was held at Mount Vernon on Dec. 18, 1799.
From his deathbed, Washington had issued emphatic orders that he
not be entombed for at least three days. There was a widespread
fear of premature burial at the time. Washington also looked over
his last will and testament during the long day on his deathbed. He
died in the early evening of suffocation _ stricken by quinsy, an
abscess of the throat.
</P>
<P>
   After spending much of her husband's final day at his bedside,
Martha Washington said ``all my trials are over'' after seeing his
life slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall follow soon,'' she predicted.
</P>
<P>
   She died three years later and is entombed next to her husband
in the Washington family vault.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Dandridge Custis had been a widow when she married George
Washington in 1759. She had two children at the time but the couple
would have no offspring of their own. Mount Vernon was inherited by
Bushrod Washington, nephew of the first president, after Martha
Washington died.
</P>
<P>
   In 1853, Washington's heirs sold 550 surrounding acres, the home
and outbuildings, and the tomb of George Washington to the Mount
Vernon Ladies Association _ one of the nation's earliest historic
conservation groups. The national organization has maintained and
preserved the place with private money ever since. Authentically
restored to its original appearance, Mount Vernon is open to the
public every day and close to a million people visit each year.
</P>
<P>
   However, annual attendance peaked at 1.3 million visitors in the
1960s. Now Mount Vernon's directors are hoping the bicentennial
year activities will inspire greater interest and enthusiasm about
the master of the manor.
</P>
<P>
   After considerable controversy over maintaining historical
purity, Mount Vernon was air-conditioned last year. One result of
the new, high-tech climate control was that collectors and museums
across the country were no longer afraid to lend back artifacts
that had been taken from Mount Vernon over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   So Washington's home is now even more stocked with stuff that
was there when he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Following his death, the law required that an inventory be
taken,'' said curator King Laughlin. That room-by-room accounting
of objects ``provided a virtual snapshot'' of what was in Mount
Vernon at the time and where everything was placed. Thousands of
those artifacts are now displayed in their rightful setting.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's library is now _ as it was then _ ``crammed full''
of books and chairs and maps and letters and a globe and 12
telescopes and ``a small arsenal,'' said Laughlin. Washington kept
seven rifles, several pistols, swords and ``a small cannon'' in the
room, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used the cannon to fire friendly salutes at ships passing
by'' on the Potomac, Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The huge table in the main dining room is arranged with 20 place
settings of the Washingtons' favorite china and silverware. The
first First Couple entertained often. In the Blue Room, a parlor
Washington called ``the best room in my house,'' the family's
gaming tables are set up with their chess set and playing cards.
The first president was an enthusiastic gambler. Among the displays
are lottery tickets that he signed.
</P>
<P>
   The upstairs bedroom is like it was the day Washington died.
There are even dark stains on the rug. Nearly a third of
Washington's blood, believed to be diseased, was drained in his
physician's effort to save his life. Curators considered piping in
odors but decided that authenticity couldn't be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias Lear, Washington's friend and secretary, was at his
bedside for most of his final day. During the bicentennial year, a
new multi-media presentation entitled ``Washington No More'' and
based on Lear's detailed account of those dramatic hours will be
shown in a theater built in the historic greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will be provided black armbands for a new ``Death and
Funeral Procession Tour'' that will follow the route of cavalry,
Masonic brethren, family and friends from the dining room where
mourners viewed the casket to the tomb where he was laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Dec. 18, there will be a televised re-enactment of
the full funeral.
</P>
<P>
   During February, in observance of Black History Month, a daily
30-minute guided tour is focusing on the lives and contributions of
the slave who built and maintained the plantation home of the
Washingtons.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mount Vernon Museum has been renovated and filled
with new artifacts, including furnishings from Washington's
presidential office in Philadelphia (the White House was not
finished until after he left office) and a carefully restored bust
of Washington cast in 1785 by French sculptor Jean-Antonine Houdon.
The terra-cruda(cq), or unfired clay, bust was made from a plaster
mask that Washington wore, and it is said by historians to be
supposed to be his best likeness.
</P>
<P>
   After layers of white paint were removed from the bust,
Washington ended up having a smaller nose and ears than had been
seen earlier, said Meg Craft, the curator restoring the bust.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Vernon's director James Rees hopes the bust and the rest
of the bicentennial campaign will help correct the ``travesty'' of
how little most people know about ``the man who led our country to
liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled one ``well-spoken adult'' visitor who asked a guide,
``Where's the mountain?'' The guide thought the visitor was
referring to the Blue Ridge Mountains but the tourist said, ``No,
the mountain with all of the presidents' heads.''
</P>
<P>
   The tourist had confused Mount Vernon with South Dakota's Mount
Rushmore, Rees said.

   MOUNT VERNON, Va. _ Nearly two centuries have passed since
George Washington _ after being bled by would-be healers and
prophetically reviewing his will _ whispered `` 'tis well'' and
died in an upstairs bedroom of his beloved mansion beside the
Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the bicentennial year of Washington's death on Dec. 14,
1799, the keepers of his historic homestead and his legacy are
fearful that the Father of His Country is being forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The number of visitors to Washington's carefully maintained
plantation has stagnated, and many schoolchildren are shockingly
ignorant about the life and times of the Revolutionary War
commander and the nation's first president, said Michael Quinn,
programs director at Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Today's youngsters don't even know the boyhood legend of young
George declaring ``I cannot tell a lie'' and admitting to chopping
down his father's favorite cherry tree, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask people if they've ever heard of George Washington and
the cherry tree and they say 'No','' marveled Quinn, recalling the
familiar but apocryphal tale.
</P>
<P>
   So, seeking to restore Washington to his traditional place of
``first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his
countrymen,'' the directors of Mount Vernon have begun a $3 million
campaign to spread his story far and wide during the bicentennial
year of his death.
</P>
<P>
   The effort features new programs, a re-enactment of his funeral
at Mount Vernon and a traveling exhibit of 100 artifacts ranging
from his infamous false teeth (made of ivory, not wood) to a
miniature replica of his home. This ``Only in 1799'' collection
will be at the Atlanta History Center from Oct. 14, 1999, until
Jan. 6, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers also have set up new Internet web sites
(www.gwashington1999.org and www.mountvernon.org) and contacted
communities across the country about staging their own
commemorations.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Vernon's bicentennial events officially opened on
Presidents Day (Washington's real 267th birthday is tomorrow) and
will continue into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to create a nationwide buzz about George Washington,
Quinn explained.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Washington's death, there was a remarkable
outpouring of emotion throughout the new nation. President John
Adams _ Washington's successor _ issued a proclamation that every
American wear a black armband for 30 days and most of the citizens
willingly complied, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   The Daughters of the American Revolution later did an historic
fashion study that showed most American women wore black mourning
dresses throughout the year of 1800, he said. Over 150 communities
staged their own funerals for this first national hero.
</P>
<P>
   The official funeral was held at Mount Vernon on Dec. 18, 1799.
From his deathbed, Washington had issued emphatic orders that he
not be entombed for at least three days. There was a widespread
fear of premature burial at the time. Washington also looked over
his last will and testament during the long day on his deathbed. He
died in the early evening of suffocation _ stricken by quinsy, an
abscess of the throat.
</P>
<P>
   After spending much of her husband's final day at his bedside,
Martha Washington said ``all my trials are over'' after seeing his
life slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall follow soon,'' she predicted.
</P>
<P>
   She died three years later and is entombed next to her husband
in the Washington family vault.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Dandridge Custis had been a widow when she married George
Washington in 1759. She had two children at the time but the couple
would have no offspring of their own. Mount Vernon was inherited by
Bushrod Washington, nephew of the first president, after Martha
Washington died.
</P>
<P>
   In 1853, Washington's heirs sold 550 surrounding acres, the home
and outbuildings, and the tomb of George Washington to the Mount
Vernon Ladies Association _ one of the nation's earliest historic
conservation groups. The national organization has maintained and
preserved the place with private money ever since. Authentically
restored to its original appearance, Mount Vernon is open to the
public every day and close to a million people visit each year.
</P>
<P>
   However, annual attendance peaked at 1.3 million visitors in the
1960s. Now Mount Vernon's directors are hoping the bicentennial
year activities will inspire greater interest and enthusiasm about
the master of the manor.
</P>
<P>
   After considerable controversy over maintaining historical
purity, Mount Vernon was air-conditioned last year. One result of
the new, high-tech climate control was that collectors and museums
across the country were no longer afraid to lend back artifacts
that had been taken from Mount Vernon over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   So Washington's home is now even more stocked with stuff that
was there when he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Following his death, the law required that an inventory be
taken,'' said curator King Laughlin. That room-by-room accounting
of objects ``provided a virtual snapshot'' of what was in Mount
Vernon at the time and where everything was placed. Thousands of
those artifacts are now displayed in their rightful setting.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's library is now _ as it was then _ ``crammed full''
of books and chairs and maps and letters and a globe and 12
telescopes and ``a small arsenal,'' said Laughlin. Washington kept
seven rifles, several pistols, swords and ``a small cannon'' in the
room, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used the cannon to fire friendly salutes at ships passing
by'' on the Potomac, Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The huge table in the main dining room is arranged with 20 place
settings of the Washingtons' favorite china and silverware. The
first First Couple entertained often. In the Blue Room, a parlor
Washington called ``the best room in my house,'' the family's
gaming tables are set up with their chess set and playing cards.
The first president was an enthusiastic gambler. Among the displays
are lottery tickets that he signed.
</P>
<P>
   The upstairs bedroom is like it was the day Washington died.
There are even dark stains on the rug. Nearly a third of
Washington's blood, believed to be diseased, was drained in his
physician's effort to save his life. Curators considered piping in
odors but decided that authenticity couldn't be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias Lear, Washington's friend and secretary, was at his
bedside for most of his final day. During the bicentennial year, a
new multi-media presentation entitled ``Washington No More'' and
based on Lear's detailed account of those dramatic hours will be
shown in a theater built in the historic greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will be provided black armbands for a new ``Death and
Funeral Procession Tour'' that will follow the route of cavalry,
Masonic brethren, family and friends from the dining room where
mourners viewed the casket to the tomb where he was laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Dec. 18, there will be a televised re-enactment of
the full funeral.
</P>
<P>
   During February, in observance of Black History Month, a daily
30-minute guided tour is focusing on the lives and contributions of
the slave who built and maintained the plantation home of the
Washingtons.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mount Vernon Museum has been renovated and filled
with new artifacts, including furnishings from Washington's
presidential office in Philadelphia (the White House was not
finished until after he left office) and a carefully restored bust
of Washington cast in 1785 by French sculptor Jean-Antonine Houdon.
The terra-cruda(cq), or unfired clay, bust was made from a plaster
mask that Washington wore, and it is said by historians to be
supposed to be his best likeness.
</P>
<P>
   After layers of white paint were removed from the bust,
Washington ended up having a smaller nose and ears than had been
seen earlier, said Meg Craft, the curator restoring the bust.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Vernon's director James Rees hopes the bust and the rest
of the bicentennial campaign will help correct the ``travesty'' of
how little most people know about ``the man who led our country to
liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled one ``well-spoken adult'' visitor who asked a guide,
``Where's the mountain?'' The guide thought the visitor was
referring to the Blue Ridge Mountains but the tourist said, ``No,
the mountain with all of the presidents' heads.''
</P>
<P>
   The tourist had confused Mount Vernon with South Dakota's Mount
Rushmore, Rees said.

THREE BOOKS UNLEASH THE FLAVORS OF SOUTHWESTERN CUISINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM M. DOWD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What we have here is a convergence of tastes that border on ...
well, the border.
</P>
<P>
   The bold, brassy flavors of the American West and Southwest, and
the pleasures of Mexican food teamed up to dominate the trio of new
cookbooks presented here.
</P>
<P>
   If you hunger for the likes of roasted corn soup, sopa seca,
tenderloin alambre and ensalada con camarones, pull up a chair and
start studying.
</P>
<P>
   But before you do, please park the outdated notion that all this
food is spicy-hot. Some is, of course, but you can find that in any
cuisine. Look, instead, for the wonderful variety of flavors and
textures created by the many national and ethnic influences.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuisine of the American Southwest, Second Edition,'' by Anne
Lindsay Greer (Gulf Publishing Co. 288 pages, $29.)
</P>
<P>
   Greer is a restaurant consultant with several cookbooks to her
credit _ ``The Ultimate Low-Fat Mexican Cookbook'' and
``Contemporary Mexican Cooking.'' This effort, however, neither
overly relies on Mexican food, nor is it a Texas-centric cookbook,
as are so many that purport to represent the entire Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   In this second edition, Greer has cleverly divided recipes from
all over the Southwest into intelligent categories, including
vegetables, beverages and morning meals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dozens of recipes, Greer has made this a solid,
if somewhat awkwardly sized (8 1/2-by-11-inch) reference book for
those unfamiliar with this cooking style. An excellent glossary
from achiote to zarzuel, ingredient lists, equipment and techniques
section, and menu and party suggestions will help you get started
or improve current skills.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Spirit of the West,'' by Beverly Cox and Martin Jacobs
(Artisan/Workman Publishing. 224 pages, $25).
</P>
<P>
   You can take the girl out of the country _ and in this case, it
was waaaay out of the country. Wyoming-born-and-raised Bev Cox left
the family cattle ranch to study at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris. She
used that classical training to work out her version of American
West cooking, and the industry has noted that.
</P>
<P>
   When she teamed up with photographer Martin Jacobs, the
collaboration resulted in ``Spirit of the Harvest: North American
Indian Cooking,'' which won a James Beard Cookbook Award. This new
``Spirit'' book is a Literary Guild selection.
</P>
<P>
   The collection of 100-plus recipes is a true representation of
the amalgam of backgrounds of people who developed the West, but
Cox included some family recipes. Cream Biscuits is particularly
interesting, developed by her great-great-grandmother, whose
husband founded the first dairy in Cheyenne, Wyo., in the late
1860s.
</P>
<P>
   Cox has a knack for relating anecdotes, catching bits of history
on ranches, and breaking recipes into periods such as pioneering
days _ both Spanish mission and U.S. expansion eras _ right up to
dude ranches. But when it comes to recipes, she shines even more
with such intriguing possibilities as atole (blue cornmeal
porridge), King Ranch chili steaks, butterscotch rolls, Dakota
golden pheasant fricasse and Oklahoma cowboy stew.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The El Paso Chile Company's Sizzlin' Supper,'' by W. Park Kerr
(William Morrow &AMP; Co. 194 page, $18.95).
</P>
<P>
   This is Kerr's third Southwestern cookbook, ``Burning Desires''
and ``The El Paso Chile Company's Texas Border Cookbook'' being the
first two. And, yes, there is an El Paso Chile Co. It's run by Kerr
and his mother, producing Southwestern food products.
</P>
<P>
   This nine-chapter offering relies heavily on robust-sounding
recipes (Fork and Knife Chicken Soup With Chile Corn Dumplings,
Horseradish Potato Salad, Going-to-Hell-in-a-Handbasket Pasta). And
the ingredients and preparation instructions support that attitude.
This is a small book of big tastes _ the fiery and sweet chiles so
popular in the Southwest; thick sauces and gravies for meats and
poultry; fresh vegetarian salads and salsas. No lists of utensils,
definitions or tips. Just flat-out, easy-to-follow recipes. Yee
hah!

 &HT;    Hail to their chief chow-down choices
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We who cook are known to follow the calendar closely, searching
for inspiration. Most of the time it's easy. Special occasions and
holidays usually have a signature dish that we merely need to find
a new and interesting twist for to keep our culinary repertoire
fresh.
</P>
<P>
   But Presidents Day is tough.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't exactly find such a signature dish on the Internet,
</P>
<P>
   but we did find some intriguing information about presidential
food preferences, as well as some interesting possibilities for
Presidents Day fare.
</P>
<P>
   At http://detroitnews.com/menu/stories/35819.htm we found ``All
the Presidents' Menus,'' a newspaper article that included a number
of recipes proving that if there is any food preference common to
most of the presidents, it's corn.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with George Washington, who regularly ate hominy and
hoe cakes made of cornmeal, most presidents, according to
historical record, are known to have enjoyed some form of corn.
James Madison loved Dolley's spoonbread. Rutherford B. Hayes and
Herbert Hoover could not pass up cream of corn soup. And Eleanor
and Franklin were known to start each day with fried cornmeal mush
for breakfast. And then, ``the corniest of all'' presidents,
according to the article, was Jimmy Carter, who served grits not
only at family meals but to foreign dignitaries as well. While all
this was interesting, the idea of grits and cornmeal mush on
Presidents Day did not set our hearts to fluttering.
</P>
<P>
   For that we went to http://www.soupsong.com/bfaves.html, a
humorous, award-winning site chock-full of _ of all things _ the
favorite soups of celebrities, presidents included.
</P>
<P>
   There is the mock turtle soup of Abraham Lincoln, JFK's cream of
chicken and onion soup, Gerald Ford's navy bean soup, Ronald
Reagan's hamburger soup and many more. Incidentally, Linda Tripp's
(who is listed as a late 20th-century audiotape specialist)
favorite is cabbage soup, and her friend Monica's favorite is
pumpkin (this info from the tapes).
</P>
<P>
   And then, at http://www.monticello.org/Day/dining/home.html, we
visited Thomas Jefferson, probably the greatest foodie president of
all and the one who came closest to giving us the quintessential
Presidents Day dish, or for that matter the quintessential American
dish _ macaroni and cheese. While early Colonists were known to add
this or that to boiled noodles, it wasn't until Jefferson came home
from Paris in 1787 with a pasta-making machine from Italy and had
his Monticello cooks start making ``Macaroni Pie'' that the dish
became de rigueur at American tables. For more on America's ``First
Gourmet,'' visit http://members.home.net/jjschnebel/Cookup5.html.

   A NICE GUY WHO COOKS
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Joe Dobrowolski is a cream puff, according to Fran
Plunkett of Peachtree City (Ga.) _ who is also Mrs. Dobrowolski.
She met him at the airport in December 1997 while she was waiting
for her sister's flight to arrive and he was killing time before
departing to his hometown of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was eating a burger and drinking a beer when I asked to
borrow his pen so I could jot down my parking spot number,'' she
recalls. They talked for several hours, and during that time Joe
revealed to her that he would never marry again _ and that he loved
to cook.
</P>
<P>
   They exchanged telephone numbers and ``as we parted, I thought
`what a nice man,' and I would probably never hear another word
from him.'' Two weeks later he called, and Valentine's weekend of
1998 she enjoyed the first of Joe's fabulous meals. They married in
October and Joe even catered their wedding. Her favorite thing in
Joe's repertoire: his cream puffs with chocolate sprinkles, which
he made for her birthday in place of a cake.

   THE WAY TO A MAN'S HEART . . .
</P>
<P>
   Cheese souffle never fails to revive poignant memories for
Janice Vernon Slocum of Kennesaw (Ga.) of her beloved late husband,
Richard.
</P>
<P>
   She relates this scenario, which she said played out several
times over the course of her married life:
</P>
<P>
   ``The children are tucked into bed, stories read and prayers
said. Now I hurry down the stairs to begin a special meal for my
</P>
<P>
   dearest Richard. . . . I hear the car drive up and the buzzer go
off at the same time. How perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quickly I put the salad on the table, light the candles and,
pulling the souffle from the oven, I carry it gingerly to (the
table.) As he comes through the door tired and dragging, his face
lights up at the sight of that fluffy, puffed-up golden souffle
sending out the most wonderful aroma. I get a great big bear hug
from my man, and the rest of the evening is a delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheese souffle always soothed away the rough edges and made
him soft and delectable, just like the dish.''

   APHRODITE'S FAVE: CHICKEN POTPIE
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicken potpie is an aphrodisiac. Just ask my husband,
Robert,'' wrote Betty Jean Jordan. She made it for him on their
second date, and Robert, who at that time was used to eating frozen
dinners, was smitten. In the four years they have been married,
Betty Jean has tried many new dishes on Robert, who, she says, ``is
still a good guinea pig.'' He is diplomatic, too. When something
isn't any good, the worst Robert will say is, ``It's interesting,''
she reports. Sometimes, though, she adds, ``I go back to the
tried-and-true favorites such as the aphrodisiac _ I mean chicken
potpie.''
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Chicken Potpie
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings Preparation time: 1 hour, 20 minutes Cooking
time: 30-40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 whole chicken breasts
</P>
<P>
   For pie crusts:
</P>
<P>
   2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup shortening
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   For white sauce:
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2 cups (or more) milk
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 10-ounce package frozen mixed vegetables
</P>
<P>
   Place chicken in a saucepan, cover with water and boil until
done, about 30 minutes. Chill thoroughly, then cut in bite-size
chunks.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly oil an 8-by-8-inch casserole dish.
</P>
<P>
   For the pie crusts: Blend flour and salt in a medium bowl. Cut
in shortening until pea-size balls form. Add water, 1 tablespoon at
a time, stirring after each addition. Divide dough in half. Roll
out each half on a floured surface. Place one pie crust in the
bottom of the prepared dish and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   For the white sauce: Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high
heat. Add flour and stir. Gradually add enough milk in batches to
reach desired consistency and to make at least 2 cups sauce. Stir
constantly with a fork or whisk. Sauce will thicken as you stir.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large mixing bowl, combine
cubed chicken, mixed vegetables and at least 2 cups white sauce.
Add salt and pepper to taste. Mix thoroughly and pour into
casserole dish. Place second crust on top and trim overhang. Cut
out shapes with the trimmings and place on top of crust for
decoration, or freeze leftover dough for later use. Bake about
30-40 minutes, or until crust is browned.

   ALL'S FAIR IN LOVE AND WAR
</P>
<P>
   As Ken Cain was preparing to move, he called Bobbie Pardue, the
agent who had sold him his home, to list it for sale. ``He
suggested I come to dinner and I thought it a little strange but
said, `why not?' said Bobbie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken started the evening with a glass of wine, then shrimp
cocktail, and then on to salmon steak. At that point I thought the
next course was going to be breakfast,'' she laughed. She did go
home that night with a doggie bag of delicious desserts, though.
</P>
<P>
   Three nights later he called again ``under the guise of showing
me something on the computer,'' said Bobbie. The menu consisted of
Rock Cornish hens and wild rice. They eloped 90 days later.
</P>

   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Roast Cornish Game Hens
</P>
<P>

section of supermarkets) or sweet-and-sour sauce
</P>
<P>
   Canned mandarin orange slices (optional)

<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Wash hen inside and out with cool
water. Pat dry with paper towels. Sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon salt and
1/2 teaspoon pepper into body cavity and rub it all over inside.
Sprinkle remaining salt and pepper on the outside and rub it all
over. Put quartered onion in body cavity. Truss bird by crossing
legs and tying them together, then folding the wings as though you
were putting an arm in a hammerlock. It might be necessary to tie a
string around the breast area to hold the wings in place. Smear a
thick coat of mayonnaise all over bird. Place on rack in shallow
baking pan lined with heavy aluminum foil. Place in center of oven
and cook for 1 hour, then baste liberally with orange or
sweet-and-sour sauce. Raise oven temperature to 400 degrees and
continue cooking for 30 minutes, basting with sauce every 10
minutes. Place on plate and garnish with drained orange slices
drizzled with sauce. Serve with rice pilaf.

<P>
   The year was 1969 and Laura Shevlin, who now lives in the ``the
far exurbs of Atlanta _ Auburn, Ala.,'' was newly and unexpectedly
single and setting up a new apartment. She needed to lay carpet and
called on her friend Phil Shevlin to help. As compensation for his
efforts, she prepared a meal they still remember: Chicken Cordon
Bleu, Twice Stuffed Potatoes and her mother's recipe for Coffee
Mallow. They sprawled out on the new shag carpet and watched the
movie ``The Young Lions.''
</P>
<P>
   They married a few months later. This Valentine's Day, as they
fondly remember that ``lastingly successful dinner from long ago
and far away,'' the Shevlins will likely sip champagne by the fire
and maybe even rent ``The Young Lions.''

   COUPLE MAKES LOVING DEAL
</P>
<P>
   As far as Sally Boice is concerned, the present her husband,
Chris, gave her for Christmas was better than diamonds. Sally is a
dietitian and health educator, so food and nutrition play a big
part in her professional life as well as at home, where she is the
primary chef.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eating her delicious meals day after day, I realized I may
have been taking her efforts for granted,'' said Chris. So for
Christmas he presented her with a ``check'' for 52 meals, to be
cooked by him every Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's even part of the deal that I don't have to clean up,''
says Sally. And that, to her, ``has to take the cake for the most
romantic cook.''

 &HT;    Cupid in the kitchen
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Henry Kissinger was wrong. Power is not the ultimate
aphrodisiac. Seductive as private jets, fat stock portfolios and
overnights in the Lincoln Bedroom may be, it's food that truly
warms the heart, heals the hurt and nourishes not only the body but
the soul.
</P>
<P>
   This was the sentiment shared by readers who wrote and called to
tell us sometimes funny, sometimes poignant and often very romantic
stories about how food, thoughtfully prepared and lovingly served,
sparked love and lasting admiration for a special person in their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   In Donna DiLoreto's case, that would be her husband, Vincent
(she calls him Vincenzo). He's been lavishing his Irish-American
wife with loving gestures and romantic culinary feats for 32 years.
He sent flowers after their first date, roses on the second, then a
poem with her name in every line and, finally, an engagement ring
sparkling in a cocktail. On their fifth date, they married.
</P>
<P>
   One Valentine's Day, she recalls, he prepared her swordfish in
the shape of a heart, and then surprised her with a heart-shaped
diamond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people go on cruises to faraway places and think it's so
romantic,'' says Donna, a high school Spanish teacher from
Alpharetta (Ga.). ``For Vincent and me, preparing a meal together,
sipping wine, listening to music, and then eating fabulous food,
now that's amore.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dr. George Shambaugh III, his talents in the kitchen helped
lead him to the altar.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the widowed Chicago endocrinologist retrieved
from his briefcase the business card of a woman he'd met briefly
seven years earlier at a convention here. Recalling the pleasant
conversation they'd had at a booth at the World Congress Center, he
decided to write her. A telephone friendship ensued. He invited her
to visit him in Chicago. But having suffered a traumatic divorce,
she was skeptical _ until her daughter convinced her to go for it.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the chicken etouffee, the twice-cooked catfish and the
homemade cherry pie, and things warmed up considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ``His food was a balm to emotional recovery,'' said Roberta
Shambaugh, who then struck up a long-distance romance with him and
married him a year later. ``Before he would return to Chicago, he
would even make sure I had food in the freezer until the next time
he came.''
</P>
<P>
   He continues to ensure she's well-fed in between commutes until
he retires this summer and moves to Atlanta permanently.
</P>
<P>
   A great meal was also the turning point in Byron and Shannon
Price's relationship. The two had been platonic friends for years.
After Byron helped Shannon cope with the death of her mother, the
two began to realize that their relationship went deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon invited him to her apartment for ``a thank-you meal to
see what was what.''
</P>
<P>
   After dining on steamed artichokes with lemon mayonnaise,
chicken cordon bleu, green beans amandine and homemade garlic
mashed potatoes, Byron declared his love that night. ``I don't know
whether it was me or the food, but we were engaged a year later and
married last November,'' Shannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Greg and Rachel Grimes of Jasper don't go so far as to credit
her chocolate chip poundcake with their engagement. But it will
forever hold a place in their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   When the couple decided to marry, Rachel, a college student on a
limited income, wanted more than anything to buy Greg a fine
wedding ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was praying about how to get the ring when I heard God say,
`You can cook, can't you?' ''
</P>
<P>
   She could _ and she did, making more than 70 of her renowned
poundcakes and selling them for $10 apiece. Today, ``Greg never
takes his ring off and I still make these cakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was not always a sumptuous feast or prized culinary
specialty that resonated in the hearts of the people who wrote to
us.
</P>
<P>
   For Deanna and Walt Pettit of Marietta (Ga.), it was the memory
of a disastrous chocolate cake they made together nearly 50 years
ago as kids. She was 11 and he was 12 ``when somehow we got elected
to bake a chocolate cake for a Valentine's Day party we were having
with our friends,'' Deanna wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The cake was ``so bad we threw it around like a Frisbee, dropped
it and it bounced . . . but we put icing on it and served it
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   That memory lingered long after Deanna's family moved away and
they married different people. But both marriages ended in divorce,
and eventually the childhood friends found their way back to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   They've been married 39 years and have three children and three
grandchildren. And yes, every time they eat chocolate cake, they
remember.

NEWSPAPERS FACE DELUGE OF LETTERS ON IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some Americans may be tired of the impeachment
trial of President Clinton, but not Wil Watkins of Vallejo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The self-described artist and patriot has written 100 letters
this year to newspapers and members of Congress urging that Clinton
be removed from office. He has watched the Senate proceedings every
day on public television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care a great deal,'' said Watkins, 69, who writes under the
pen name Captain Omoo, a character in a Herman Melville novel.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins is one of many people who have flooded newspapers around
the country with letters, faxes and electronic mail about
impeachment in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The response represents the largest volume of correspondence to
the San Francisco Examiner on any news story in at least a decade,
and editors at newspapers across the country say they, too, are
hearing from huge numbers of readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may not care, but they're writing us to tell us they
don't care,'' said David Boerner, Voice of the People editor for
the Akron Beacon-Journal in Ohio. ``They keep writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Johnson, letters editor at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
said the flood of mail began last August when independent counsel
Kenneth Starr released his report on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Starr report came out, we were just inundated,''
Johnson said. ``We were getting upwards of 300 letters a day. It
ran that way for two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the volume of letters has since dropped, but
remains heavy _ about 75 impeachment letters each day, or half of
all letters received.
</P>
<P>
   David Kirp, a professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy
at the University of California at Berkeley, said the people
writing letters represent the vocal minorities on both sides of the
impeachment debate who remain engaged, while polls show most
Americans want Congress to move on to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the CNN junkies, the MS-MonicaWatch junkies,'' Kirp
said. ``It doesn't surprise me that there is a continued
fascination with it. The people who watch the impeachment trial all
the time are the same folks who want to talk about it and write
about it as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Ora Jones, an employment counselor at St. Anthony Foundation in
San Francisco, was steamed up enough last week to fax a letter:
``Even Jerry Springer knows when to stop the show. Why don't the
Republicans?''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 54, a die-hard Democrat from Richmond, said the story
remains the hot topic of conversation at her office and her Baptist
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like it to be over with, but I still keep up with
what's going on,'' Jones said. ``The man made a mistake. He
apologized. I think we should forgive him.''
</P>
<P>
   Letter writers tend to break into two types: first-time writers
who get fired up about a particular issue, and regular writers who
make a hobby of making their opinions known.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter camp is Thomas Edwards of San Francisco, a
67-year-old conservative Republican. He boasts that he stopped
counting after 6,000 of his letters were published in the Examiner,
gay newspapers, news magazines and on ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and his partner, Thomas Lundquist, 45, also a regular
letter writer, share a disdain for Clinton. They often post their
published letters in the front window of their San Francisco flat,
along with a couple of anti-Clinton books.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of one-finger salutes,'' said Edwards, who posts
all his letters with stamps of President Richard Nixon, his hero.
``It's politically incorrect to be a gay Republican. I wear that
badge with honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards served in the U.S. Army in Europe for two years, and has
repeatedly blasted Clinton in print for dodging the draft. He
detested the New Deal liberalism of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt,
and calls the Clintons the ``Marxist god-children'' of the
Roosevelts.
</P>
<P>
   For Edwards, impeachment has just provided another avenue for
his anti-Clinton rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that a man who is an admitted liar, who is
significantly a perjurer, who is an adulterer, who is a
draft-dodger who turned his back on his country. ... I don't think
the man deserves to be in office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others said only something as serious as the possible
removal of the president would inspire them to write.
</P>
<P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Warren Callister, an 82-year-old architect from Tiburon, said he
was so bent out of shape by the Republican efforts to impeach
Clinton that he typed nearly two dozen letters to members of
Congress, newspapers, the American Civil Liberties Union and the
California Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``In architecture, we think of things being in scale. This is
just so out of scale,'' said Callister, who said he fears the
precedent of removing a president for relatively minor misdeeds.
``It's like making the medicine cabinet the most important project
in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Louise Hullinger, a retired elementary school teacher from
Chicago, said she decided to write to the Examiner while reading
the newspaper on a Hawaiian cruise and seeing an item asking for
readers' views on impeachment. On stationery from American Hawaii
Cruises, she wrote: ``Despite the polls showing that people favor
Clinton, I have NEVER MET a person who thinks he should remain in
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Woodruff, editorial page editor for the Missoulian in
Montana, said he has seen a slight drop in letters since January.
``I think what you see and have seen is a realization that the
president is not going to be removed from office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Writers of letters to the editor do not necessarily reflect the
views of the populace. According to Richard Aregood, editorial page
editor of the Newark Star-Ledger in New Jersey, they are more
likely to be older, retired and ``have more time to fulminate and
get p----d off.''
</P>
<P>
   And editors say the letter-writers reflect a more conservative
point of view than that of the communities the newspapers serve.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment letters still make up close to 75 percent of the
average 225 letters the Star-Ledger receives each week. But Aregood
said he believes the people writing are the only ones who still
care about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm about as tired of (impeachment letters) as I am of this
whole thing,'' Aregood said. ``The ones who hate him, hate him. The
ones who don't hate him, don't hate him. ... I can remember no
issue with the boring sameness of opinion in such profusion.''

SCHOOL DAZE WITH THE CHRISTIAN RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ All right, put down your pencils, Republican
presidential candidates, your time is up. Pass your litmus tests to
the right.
</P>
<P>
   I do mean right.
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, magazine publisher Steve
Forbes and ``traditional values'' activist Gary Bauer spent last
week answering a 10-page take-home questionnaire from a
conservative group called the Committee to Restore American Values.
</P>
<P>
   The group numbers among its members such right-wing
heavy-weights as Paul Weyrich and Phyllis Schlafly, and Randy Tate,
executive director of the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to know how the candidates stood on such burning
issues as whether they'd support the removal of the words ``under
God'' from the Pledge of Allegiance and whether they'd allow a
nativity scene on the White House lawn.
</P>
<P>
   I think I can figure out the right answers to those.
</P>
<P>
   But how about this one: ``Do you normally call games of chance
`gambling' or `gaming?'''
</P>
<P>
   I guess it depends if you're a politician from Nevada or not.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Dan, spelling counts. Stop erasing and hand in that
questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   Just the fact that Quayle, Forbes and Bauer and a few even
lesser Republican lights agreed to take a written litmus test in
order to run for president should rule them out as candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Do you want a president who does homework when ordered? Forbes
went to Princeton, and now he has to write essays about the Pledge
of Allegiance? Do you want a president who lingered over the
question of whether ``gambling'' is more politically right than
``gaming''?
</P>
<P>
   Do you want a president who labored, pencil in mouth, over the
question ``Would you require judicial nominees to possess
philosophical qualifications in addition to appropriate experience
and judicial temperament?''
</P>
<P>
   No, I want someone with absolutely no philosophy. Is that the
right answer?
</P>
<P>
   The Committee to Restore American Values (or ``CRAV,'' and why
not add ``Eventually or Now,'' and get ``CRAVEN''?) followed up its
creche question with: ``Would you place a creche on the White House
lawn if ordered to refrain from doing so by the Supreme Court?''
</P>
<P>
   They stopped short of asking would-be presidential candidates
whether they'd use troops to defend the model manger.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the most important questions on the 79-question
litmus test were about abortion, and candidates should know how to
answer those questions in order to win the primary and lose the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the questionnaire, the conservative group asked
candidates to sign a pledge that their ``voting patterns'' would
reflect the views expressed in the questionnaire about abortion,
judicial appointments, the size of the federal government, gaming,
gambling, gun control and nativity scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that a president doesn't vote on such issues, but
only vetoes legislation. I don't think the president is even in
charge of White House Christmas decorations.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else you say about Texas Gov. George W. Bush, former
American Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole, former Tennessee Gov.
Lamar Alexander and Arizona Sen. John McCain, at least they refused
to take the test.
</P>
<P>
   That makes me think better of them. But it's going to count
against them with the people who count.
</P>
<P>
   You have to bow in the right direction on issues of abortion,
gun control and creches, or your candidacy is dead in New Hampshire
and every other primary.
</P>
<P>
   Being a Republican candidate for president is hard. It's a lot
harder than being Al Gore, who can just stand there looking upright
next to Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidates have impeachment managers burning down
their party. They have porno kings trying to catch them in
infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   They have right-wingers with pots of money and squads of
fanatical primary voters giving them questionnaires, litmus tests,
and probably even little cups to take into the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder we're starting to hear the phrase ``compassionate
conservatism'' coming from slightly left-of-right, referring mainly
to the stance of the leading Republican candidate, Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Some say ``compassionate conservatism'' is an oxymoron like
``military intelligence.'' Some say it's trickle-down economics
with a tear trickling down its cheek.
</P>
<P>
   I say that compassion begins at home, and we should have some
for conservatives like George W. Bush, Elizabeth Dole and John
McCain. No liberal will ever be as hard on them as the
uncompassionate conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   And they can't make up for not taking that test by doing
extra-credit work.

CASPIAN PORT'S OIL GUSH TRICKLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKU, Azerbaijan _ In a way, Scott Barber's map of the Caspian
Sea resembles those lottery tickets Americans scratch to win _
except the jackpot here could be worth several trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Barber, who heads the Baku office of the US oil company Unocal,
displayed a line of green patches extending offshore from
Azerbaijan's capital. These are the winners, where ``world class
oilfields,'' as Barber puts it, have been found, fueling dreams of
rapid prosperity for Azerbaijan and the other impoverished former
Soviet republics of the Caspian basin.
</P>
<P>
   But those dreams, echoes of Baku's storied past as a source of
the oil fortunes of the Nobels, Rockefellers, and Rothschilds have
yet to come true. An ambitious $4 billion plan to build a pipeline
to ship the crude out of the landlocked region to Western markets
has stalled; so has the Clinton administration's strategy to change
the geopolitical order in a part of the world that has spent most
of the century as Moscow's colonial outpost.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the delay is that world oil prices have hit
25-year lows, making potential investors wary of spending to build
a new pipeline. But Barber's map reveals another snag. Around the
green patches are many more pink spots. These are areas where there
ought to be oil, but no one will know for sure until someone
explores them. And then there are the offshore projects that have
already turned up losers.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the field where a consortium led by Unocal has
already drilled twice, and come up dry. If one more scratch of the
ticket, a test drilling scheduled for this summer, fails to yield a
winner, Barber says the consortium is going to pack it up. It would
not be the first. Last month, a $3 billion project led by the US
company Pennzoil, another of the Western oil giants that flocked to
Azerbaijan after the 1991 Soviet collapse, announced it would close
down its operation after its test wells revealed disappointing
crude reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is: Which estimates of the Caspian's reserves
are true? Some say 200 billion barrels, which would make it second
only to the Persian Gulf and the world's most important new source
of energy well into the next century. Others say it is closer to 20
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Oil executives here say it is too early to declare Baku's boom a
bust. About 15 other international consortiums are still in the
early stages of seismic research of their plots. But the mood has
definitely soured in this rundown medieval city of abandoned oil
derricks and faded mansions _ traces of last century's boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are starting to get negative about it,'' said
Sabit Bagirov, a former president of Azerbaijan's state oil
company. ``The early estimates were exaggerated, and now we are
coming down to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Azerbaijan International Operating Co., a consortium
of international oil majors that in 1994 signed the $7.4 billion
``Contract of the Century'' to drill the first wells, announced
plans to cut costs by 20 percent and eliminate 25 to 30 expatriate
staff members.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the international consortium controls the winners on
Scott Barber's map. The flow from these fields is being pumped out
through two small pipelines, one that takes it north through Russia
out to the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk, and another that travels
through the Georgian port of Supsa. These two routes are capable of
carrying the 105,000 barrels per day that Azerbaijan International
Operating Co. expects to be shipping by the end of the year, but
inadequate to manage the 800,000 barrels a day expected by the year
2007.
</P>
<P>
   To meet this demand, the plan has always been to build a larger
pipeline out. But now questions have arisen about the Azerbaijan
International Operating Co. timetable. Plans to raise production
from current levels to 300,000 barrels per day in 2002 are on hold,
the consortium's officials say, because the transportation costs
too much to make it profitable given the low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Now, low prices and concerns about reserves have added doubts to
plans for a new pipeline already embroiled in international
controversy over which of several routes should be chosen. The US,
Azerbaijan, and Turkish governments are pushing to build it through
Turkey to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan. But oil companies, wary
of the high cost, would prefer the shorter, cheaper route through
Supsa, where it could be shipped across the Black Sea and through
the Bosphorus out to the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a final decision on the route for the main pipeline
was delayed three times. This year looks like more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're by no means close to deciding which of these routes we
should take,'' said the consortium's vice president, Robin
Branagan. ``What we need as we move toward making this decision is
an idea of how much oil there is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, oil executives are indicating that the amount of oil
flowing out of Azerbaijan will not exceed the capacity of the
existing pipelines for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's naturally dialing down each time we delay the formal
announcement,'' said Barber of Unocal, which is also a member of
Azerbaijan International Operating Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration contends that the Ceyhan route, which
runs 1,075 miles through Georgia and across Turkey, would secure
Turkey's role as a major player in the Caspian region. That, in
turn, would enhance the status of a loyal NATO ally and Islamic
nation whose secular, European-style society could serve as a role
model for post-Soviet states like Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and
Turkmenistan. The Turkish route would also mean the oil would avoid
Russia and Iran, traditional powers in the region that covet the
pipelines for the chance they provide to earn transport fees and
influence local politics.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is building a pipeline to the Caspian in an apparent effort
to lure the oil companies, but while that would be the shortest
route, the threat of US sanctions against companies that deal with
the Islamic state has kept American firms from participating and
put a damper on any other deals.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is also lobbying to have the large pipeline go through
its territory. Initially seen as a security risk, because of a
60-mile stretch that goes through separatist Chechnya, the Russian
route has operated without problems since the first small amounts
began flowing out in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea of Russia controlling all the oil has little
support in Azerbaijan, where Moscow's past rule is remembered with
bitterness and current intentions are seen with suspicion. When
Russia recently agreed to base state-of-the-art weapons in
neighboring Armenia, with whom Azerbaijan fought and lost a war ,
Azerbaijani leaders saw it as an attempt to pressure them, and one
official even called for NATO bases near Baku to counter the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest opponents to the Turkish route are the oil
companies, who say the $4 billion cost is too steep.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put the oil out through Ceyhan, you could be looking at
$4 per barrel transport costs, which, given today's low cost of
oil, could make profits nonexistent,'' Branagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has threatened to block the other routes by limiting
traffic through the Bosphorus straits, which it controls. All this
adds up to a mess no one has figured out how to solve. Some oilmen
are encouraged by a Ukrainian project to build a pipeline from
Odessa to its main pipeline that transports Siberian oil to Europe,
but that, too, has its pitfalls, among them the proximity of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   About the only people optimistic that a deal will be concluded
are Clinton administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there can be an agreement within the next year,''
Richard Morningstar, US special envoy on Caspian issues said last
week, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijanis are beginning to realize that their economy will
not feel the salutary effects of their oil for years to come. The
first profits will go to the companies to pay for their costs. And
that is only when the pipeline is built.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought there would be instant millions,'' said Etibar
Mammadov, who finished second in Azerbaijan's presidential
elections in October. ``Now these hopes are fading.''

BOWLING BUDDIES SEE `FACE-SAVING EXERCISE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The politics of the sometime bowlers in lanes
seven and eight follow the same trajectory as too many of their
rolls: far left of center.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the six breaks 100; two score 81. Everyone cheers
the rare spare. Gutter balls elicit a group groan. No one really
wins, and no one playing below an impressive collection of neon
beer signs really loses.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than the friends can say about Washington and the
rest of the country these days. A while back, they decided to stop
discussing the presidential impeachment proceedings at the
nonprofit housing agency where they all work. Otherwise, they
figured, someone might quit in a huff.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they wish the Senate would do the same. They say they want
the closed-door debate that got under way Tuesday to lead to a
quick resolution. None of them expects serious discussion, on the
assumption that all minds are made up already. Instead, hours,
maybe days, will be devoted to devising strategies to do no more
than save face, as they put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they're trying to do is figure out how to get it over
with,'' said Anne Mavity, 35, who scored a
none-too-shabby-for-her-crowd 96.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just finishing the face-saving exercise,'' said Herb
Frey, who ran unsuccessfully for the Minnesota legislature and
didn't fare much better at the bowling alley, bringing in an 81.
``I don't expect anything out of Washington anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Steve Thomas, 42 and the victor with a score of 125, ``The
biggest issue for people is frustration. And it's both parties.
There's nothing coming out of the Democrats or Republicans. They're
all meant for one another.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say these bowlers don't lean toward one side. They
do. Two voted for consumer advocate Ralph Nader in the last
presidential election, and another two say he's too centrist for
their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the friends and colleagues are clearly among the 65
percent of Americans who polls say did not favor impeachment by the
House and who do not want President Clinton removed from office by
the Senate. Although they vary in their condemnations of his affair
with a former White House intern _ ranging from ``Who cares?'' to
``His behavior disgusts me'' _ they mostly say enough with the
partisan attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is we've elevated this to an impeachment trial,''
Thomas said. ``He did wrong. But it seems like this was the only
way they could come up with to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Melanie Majors, a 32-year-old who bowled an 81: ``It
proves we don't control the process, or else this wouldn't be
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even in go-its-own-way Minnesota, where former wrestler
and Reform Party candidate Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura is now
governor, the friends' political views are uncommonly liberal. And
yet they assume _ and polls show _ that their outrage over wasted
time and energy in Washington isn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this country really wants to be outraged about ethical
issues, let them be concerned about homelessness,'' Majors said.
``Those of us who don't live in Washington and aren't glued to our
TV sets are concerned about real problems. I tell you I want my
money back.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Thomas, untying his rented black-and-tan bowling shoes,
``I'm not saying I'm not outraged by what happened (between Clinton
and Monica Lewinsky) but how much more do we need to talk about it?
What does anyone in Congress have left to say on the subject?''
</P>
<P>
   The colleagues, taking in a quick game or two at trendy Bryant
Lake Bowl, say no one they know obsesses about Clinton's fate
anymore. Each read sex-drenched report put out by independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr, but now they try to avoid news on the
trial. Thomas even turned off Minnesota Public radio, a beloved
institution in the state where the program Lake Wobegon is set,
after a report left him explaining ``sexual relations'' to his
7-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me everyone is apathetic by now,'' said Mavity, an
ardent Clinton defender who calls him ``a policy wonk
extraordinaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Interjected Thomas, ``Well, everyone has an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' said Mavity, ``but when you're out with your friends,
this isn't what you're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bowling alley's smoky restaurant and bar, Eileen Shore's
reaction to a question about the trial seemed to underscore
Mavity's remark. Shore laughed. Then she added that she had sworn
off the subject after a friend asked if she could please change the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been following it way too closely,'' said Shore, a
51-year-old lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Added her sister, assistant preschool teacher Donna Shore, 46,
``Every waking moment, I'd say.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sisters opppose forcing Clinton from office, although both
also say he should have resigned. Both also voted for him twice but
say they might not again, if he was able to run and depending on
his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, they have grown disillusioned: with Clinton,
with Congress, with press coverage that they say has focused too
much on the salacious aspects of the scandal and not enough on the
substance. They don't expect their opinions to change in the coming
days because they have no expectations of Washington politicians
these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's going to be a discussion in the Senate, it's going
to be all about saving face,'' said Donna Shore. ``I don't think
anyone is under the illusion that he's going to be convicted.
Whatever they talk about at this point doesn't matter. The whole
thing is moot.''

NYC POLICE KILLING RENEWS BRUTALITY CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Amadou Diallo walked home last Thursday morning,
a little past midnight, he probably had little cause for worry. His
block on Wheeler Avenue, in the Bronx, is quiet and reasonably safe
_ a row of two-story brick apartment houses, with well-kept stoops
and nice cars parked along the curb.
</P>
<P>
   But, as he stood in his doorway, the world now knows, Diallo _ a
22-year-old African immigrant, a street vendor who kept out of
trouble and carried no weapon _ was gunned down by four police
officers firing a total of 41 bullets from their 9mm semiautomatic
handguns, hitting Diallo with 19.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since, Diallo has supplanted Abner Louima _ the
Haitian immigrant who was tortured and sodomized by police officers
two summers ago _ as a symbol of New York City's problem with
police brutality and race.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting has also rekindled concerns that the brutality
might be the flip side of the police department's crime-fighting
strategy, which has led to the city's lowest level of felonies in
over 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, more than 2,000 protesters, mainly black, held a
peaceful rally outside the US courthouse in downtown Manhattan to
demand that federal prosecutors take over the case. The US
attorneys office is ``monitoring'' the probe, which is being
handled by the Bronx district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   This was a follow-up to a rally in the Bronx last Sunday, half
as large. The Reverend Al Sharpton, who led both demonstrations,
promised more to come.
</P>
<P>
   The four officers, who have been placed on desk duty but not yet
arrested, are members of an elite corps called the Street Crimes
Unit, whose unofficial motto is ``We Own the Streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The unit's 200 officers _ one-half of one percent of the city's
police force _ were responsible for 40 percent of the gun seizures
last year. They are openly aggressive, frequently shaking down
``suspicious'' characters for the slightest reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is that the aggressive policy is one of the
cornerstones of why crime has been reduced,'' Norman Siegel,
director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said Tuesday. ``On
the other hand, it is also why civilian complaints against the
police have increased.''
</P>
<P>
   Formal complaints have risen 39 percent since Rudolph Giuliani
became mayor, from 3,600 in 1993 to 5,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Though African-Americans constitute a quarter of the city's
population, they have filed more than half the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The darker your skin,'' Siegel said, ``the more chance you'll
have your civil rights violated.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, Latinos, who tend to be lighter-skinned,
have filed 27 percent of the complaints. They make up 26 percent of
the population.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesmen have said Diallo was ``acting suspicious'' when
the four plainclothes officers approached. They also say the
officers mistook him for a rapist and that he did not respond when
they told him to ``freeze.''
</P>
<P>
   Every speaker at Tuesday's rally scoffed at this claim, and said
it did not explain, in any case, why the officers fired 41 bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the officers emptied their 16-bullet chambers. One fired
five bullets, another four.
</P>
<P>
   A deliveryman for a nearby hamburger and pizza restaurant, who
gave his name only as Robert and said he is known to everyone in
the neighborhood as ``Flaco,'' said he was standing on the corner,
a few hundred feet away, when the shooting took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like an Uzi war,'' he said Tuesday afternoon,
standing outside Diallo's apartment house. ``I thought it was a
drug fight.''
</P>
<P>
   This description was consistent with that of another witness,
who told columnist Juan Gonzalez in Tuesday's Daily News: ``First
came three shots _ bang, bang, bang. Then there was a pause. Then
came a barrage . . . like a machine gun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the questions that must be answered,'' Siegel
said. ``If they fired, then paused _ and, as they now admit, Diallo
was unarmed _ why did they proceed to fire some more?''
</P>
<P>
   The red vestibule at 1157 Wheeler Ave., where Diallo stood as
his body was pumped with bullets, has an area of only about 24
square feet. The bullet holes _ made by the 22 shots that missed
him _ are now labeled with detectives' markings: ``BH1'' (for
bullet hole 1), ``BH2,'' and so forth. Some of the holes are more
like gashes, tearing out huge slices of the side wall's plaster.
</P>
<P>
   The streets a couple of blocks away are not considered safe at
night. Drug sales are common, and the police are a constant
presence.
</P>
<P>
   But Wheeler Avenue, a working-class block of mainly Africans and
Dominicans, appears different. ``This is a quiet block,
family-oriented, people know each other,'' Maria Gonzalez said,
walking her daughter home from school.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Delgado, a retired warehouse worker, remarked, ``This is
safe. You can send your kid to the corner store any time.''
</P>
<P>
   A retail manager, who would give his name only as Joe, agreed:
``Rarely anything happens on this block.''

EX-SCHOOLMATES REMEMBER A KING IN THE MAKING 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   He waited on tables, vacuumed rugs, made his bed, shot pool,
chewed tobacco, obeyed curfew, captained the wrestling team, and
often played a prank that would trigger an international crisis
today.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's newly crowned king, during his formative years at
boarding school in Western Massachusetts, delighted in his ability
to ditch his well-armed bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he could scare them,'' recalled Jim Smith, a coach and
instructor at Deerfield Academy when King Abdullah of Jordan was
just a boy and a prince. ``He was a rascal. But he was a wonderful
young man.''
</P>
<P>
   That man, who watched somberly Monday as his 63-year-old
father's shroud-wrapped body was lowered into a grave at the royal
cemetery in Amman, Jordan, has indicated he will continue his
father's moderate policies _ a task for which his western friends
and former schoolmates said he is well-prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, they said, has always exceeded the expectations of
headmasters and coaches, teachers and proctors, and kings and
queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always known Abdullah to be extremely wise,'' said
Christopher Smith, one of the king's closest friends at Deerfield
and a guest at his 1993 wedding. ``He was more mature really than
people of our age when we were growing up. I've always known him to
be compassionate. This is a man who is truly genuine and eager to
take advice from wherever it may come.''
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old father of two was first sent off to boarding
school in England when he was 4. But most of his youth was spent in
Western Massachusetts, where in 1977 he enrolled as a sophomore at
Deerfield, where the boys wear ties, today's tuition is $23,500,
and even princes are expected to toe the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met Abdullah, he was beautifully attired in his
best Seville Row clothing, and I said, `Young man, do you know how
to run a vacuum cleaner?' '' said Bryce Lambert, a now-retired
English teacher. ``And he said, `I've Hoovered.' I told him to keep
on `Hoovering' because he was moving into the cleanest dormitory at
Deerfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert said Toni Gardiner, Abdullah's English-born mother and
the second wife of King Hussein, told Deerfield faculty members
that she was intent on raising her son to ensure that he could take
care of himself if his father ever suffered a reversal of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   That meant, with the exception of the beefy security guards who
waited outside his classrooms and accompanied the team bus to
sporting events, that Abdullah was treated like any other student
in a school whose alumni include US senators, Nobel laureates,
acclaimed authors, and titans of industry.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Smith, whose duties at the school included running its
dining hall, recalled how Abdullah feigned indignation when it was
his turn to wait on tables, a duty expected of every Deerfield
student.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up to me and said, `I think it's a shame that the
prince of Jordan has to wait on tables,' '' Smith recalled. ``It
was tongue in cheek, you know. And I grabbed him by the necktie and
I said, `Your old man might be king of Jordan, but I'm king of this
dining hall.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, when the prince put up a large contingent of
American friends at a plush Jordanian hotel for his wedding, he
greeted Smith at the airport, telling him: ``I wanted another king
at my wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see him today and I think, God bless him, he's really got it
in his lap now,'' said Smith. ``We know this is a kid who can do
it. I'm sure he's going to rise to the challenge. Being an old
football coach I just want to say to him, `You know, kiddo, it's
now the second half. Get out there and give it your best.' And I
know that's exactly what he's going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Smith, a Connecticut native and now an advertising
copy writer in Los Angeles, said he has turned down national
television interviews because he did not want to risk saying
anything that could be misinterpreted about his close friend and
old classmate, now a key figure in the fragile world of Mideast
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abdullah has many of the same qualities that his dad did,
including that great human ability to touch people without making a
big deal of who he was,'' Smith said. ``At the same time, Abdullah
has always had the confidence and natural leadership ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Their friendship, Smith said, was cemented by the unwritten rule
that the prince's station in life would command him no special
deference except for intense loyalty and protection of his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the occasions when Abdullah had to be the prince, it was
instantly clear that he was prepared and capable of acccepting the
mantle of responsibility,'' said Smith, who as a 17-year-old
acompanied his friend to his native land. ``When I witnessed him
meeting with dignitaries and the people of Jordan, he had a direct
way of communicating and still had a very common touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert said he recently sent a letter to Abdullah, who as a boy
lived with him at the 1760 Ephraim Williams House, where they shot
pool and watched football games together. The letter, he said, was
to encourage the new king during trying, transitional times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had such a great sense of humor, and I wrote him and I
said, `Whatever you do, don't let them take that wonderful smile
away from you that you always had at Deerfield,' '' Lambert said.
``It was interesting to watch him today as he carried himself with
such dignity and then to think of the times I'd beat him in pool.''

   As any regular television watcher knows, sex is not exactly
taboo on TV.
</P>
<P>
   But one subject seems to be largely off-limits, according to a
major new study released Tuesday that deals with the ``risks and
responsibilities'' of sexual activity.

<P>
   A survey of 1,351 randomly selected shows by the Henry J. Kaiser
Family Foundation found that 56 percent of all TV programs _ and 67
percent of all prime-time shows _ contained sexual content in word
or deed over the course of one week. Yet only one in 10 such shows
mentioned contraception, safe sex, or the possibility of delaying
sexual activity, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   After narrowing their focus to only the 88 scenes in which
sexual intercourse was either ``depicted or strongly implied,''
researchers discovered that not one program in the smaller sample
``made even a passing reference'' to safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   With teenage pregnancies reaching 1 million per year and
sexually transmitted diseases annually striking more than 3 million
teenagers, the sexual messages sent by TV are a matter of growing
significance, according to Vicky Rideout, director of the
foundation's Program on the Entertainment Media and Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surveys indicate that TV is one of the top sources of
information for young people about sex,'' Rideout said in an
interview. ``Obviously, parents and sex-ed classes in schools are
important, but TV is a part of the sexual socialization of young
people. It shows how men and women relate to each other, and what
the norms of sexual behavior are.''
</P>
<P>
   Just in case anyone was still in doubt, the study makes clear
just how preoccupied television has become with sex. Fully 85
percent of soap operas were found to contain sexual content; TV
movies, 83 percent; talk shows, 78 percent; dramas, 58 percent;
newsmagazines, 58 percent; sitcoms, 56 percent; reality shows, 23
percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, the study defined TV sex broadly, counting everything
from passionate kissing to flirting to ``intimate touching'' to
sexual intercourse depicted or implied. Only 7 percent of programs
fell into the latter category.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in detailing the extent of sexual content on TV,
the study sheds a statistical light on the dramatic turnabout in
recent years from the repressive attitude toward sex that
characterized television's early years.
</P>
<P>
   ``On `I Love Lucy' in the '50s, Lucy and Ricky didn't share the
same bed, even though they were married,'' observed TV historian
Steven D. Stark. ``Sex on television was fairly nonexistent until
fairly recently. In the '80s, with `Hill Street Blues,' it really
opened up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's everywhere,'' he added. ``It's even in the ads and
promos all the time. There are no barriers anymore.'' (In this,
Stark noted, television mirrors the movies.)
</P>
<P>
   But television's preoccupation with the subject does not extend
to sexual precautions, the study found. In general, the subject of
safe sex is treated in a grudging and perfunctory fashion. For
instance, even when shows did make references to sexual ``risks and
responsibilities,'' half the time they were ``minor or
inconsequential.'' In addition, only 1 percent of the shows with
sexual content made sexual risks and responsibilities a primary
emphasis of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers did find that on shows with sexual content involving
teenage characters, the shows were twice as likely to make
reference to safe sex or delaying sex. However, that still amounted
only to fewer than one in every five shows, and Rideout noted that
many shows popular among teenagers feature young adults, programs
in which safe-sex messages were rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unprotected sex in this day and age? Where are they coming
from, with AIDS a major life-and-death disease?'' remarked Peggy
Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television.
</P>
<P>
   But the foundation's study also encountered some criticism
Tuesday within hours after it was released. Privately, some network
executives complained that studies like the Kaiser foundation's
apply a quantitative measure to a qualitative issue, that simply
counting the number of sexual remarks or acts does not convey the
subject's treatment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Robert J. Thompson, head of the Center for the
Study of Popular Television, said it is unrealistic to expect
sitcom repartee to include safe-sex messages, and objected to what
he saw as attempts to ``mandate what television ought to be
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As uncomfortable as I am that every time I turn on a sitcom at
8 o'clock there's an erection joke, we also have to look at the
potential positive role television may be playing in sexuality,''
said Thompson. ``Some of the shows are beginning to talk about sex
in a sophisticated way. It can be done crudely or very well; `Ally
McBeal' is doing it very well, Howard Stern may not be doing it
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rideout emphasized that the Kaiser foundation, a
California-based, independent philanthropy that has recently begun
including the entertainment industry in its studies on public
health issues, is ``not approaching this from a moral or
ideological point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not see ourselves as sex police,'' she said. ``We're not
blaming TV for teen pregnancy. We're saying that when one out of
every two shows is communicating something about sex, it's a great
opportunity for people in the television industry to play a
positive role, to inform at the same time they're entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there's a lot of people in the television business who
care very much about the impact they have and are trying to
incorporate responsible messages into their shows,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rideout praised the WB network's popular ``Dawson's
Creek'' for depicting two teenagers ``talking about wanting to be
prepared with condoms if they have sex.'' She also lauded the UPN
network's ``Moesha'' and the WB's ``Felicity,'' two other shows
popular among young people, for incorporating discussions of safe
sex into story lines.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also acknowledged that sex is more talked about than
consummated on most shows, citing racy banter on ABC's ``Spin
City'' and ``Dharma and Greg''; NBC's ``Friends,'' ``Veronica's
Closet,'' and ``Working''; and the WB network's ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rideout said the consequences of sex should be
``part of the picture'' even when it's just talked about, because
``the way people talk about sex is communicating important
information about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 88 shows that depicted or ``strongly implied''
intercourse without any discussion of safe sex, the study singled
out a pair of daytime soap operas, CBS's ``The Young and the
Restless'' and NBC's ``Sunset Beach,'' along with TV's top-rated
show, NBC's ``ER,'' and one of its most talked about, Fox's ``Ally
McBeal.'' The study also cited Fox's ``Party of Five'' and CBS's
``Chicago Hope'' as shows that have tried to convey safe-sex
messages.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that some in the TV industry have grown uneasy
with the medium's increasing preoccupation with sex. Scott Sassa,
the new president of NBC Entertainment, recently told TV critics he
has directed NBC writers and producers to cut down on the amount of
gratituitous sexual banter and situations.
</P>
<P>
   CBS spokesman Chris Ender, while saying the network would
reserve comment on the study until officials have a chance to read
it, said that ``overall, we believe we're very responsible in our
portrayals of sex.'' Spokespersons for NBC, ABC, Fox, and the WB
said network officials would have no comment until they see the
study.

PATRIOTS LOSE REHBERG IN DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ The Cleveland Browns decided not to do their
established opponents any favors. In Tuesday's expansion draft,
they left the salary cap cloggers alone and decided to take chances
with the young, the unproven, and the inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the established Todd Rucci, who had played in 44
straight games for the Patriots, the Browns selected third-year
guard/tackle Scott Rehberg, a 6-foot-8-inch, 335-pound project who
never could climb past Damon Denson, Ed Ellis, and even rookie
center Jason Andersen on New England's depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns made Rehberg their third pick. Pro and college
personnel assistant Joe Ziobro, who was representing the Patriots
at the draft in Canton, Ohio, then pulled back running back Sedrick
Shaw from their list of exposed players, a logical move given the
recent injury to running back Robert Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Rehberg was drafted by New England in the seventh round, the
230th player taken in 1997, out of Central Michigan. His claim to
fame is that he was a teammate of New York Yankees shortstop Derek
Jeter at Central High in Kalamazoo, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Rehberg had been notified by the Browns that he would be
selected early in the draft, and he made the trip to Canton, where
he donned a Browns cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting,'' said Rehberg. ``I enjoyed my time with the
Patriots and I think I've learned a lot from (former offensive line
coach) Paul Boudreau and (assistant line coach) Jeff Davidson. To
come to a new situation where there's a chance to step in and play
is something I've been building up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehberg might be one of the linemen protecting Tim Couch, the
University of Kentucky quarterback who is expected to be the top
selection by the Browns in the college draft in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wonderful to block for a guy like Couch,'' said
Rehberg. ``But I'll do my job for whoever is back there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns liked the film they saw of Rehberg, who started his
Patriots career as a tackle and was moved to guard at the start of
training camp by Boudreau (who was let go at the end of the
season).
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a couple of our younger offensive linemen ahead of
Scott,'' said Patriots head coach Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   No other Patriot players were taken by the Browns, so wide
receiver Vincent Brisby ($1.8 million), defensive lineman Ferric
Collons ($2.2 million), and Rucci ($1.75 million) remain on the
Patriots' payroll.
</P>
<P>
   But for how long?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we feel a player isn't playing up to the salary we're
paying him, we may attempt to restructure the contract so it's more
in line with what we feel the player should be paid,'' said
Patriots vice president Andy Wasynczuk. ``The players not selected
come back to us, and now we'll make decisions based on our cap
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   They have already attempted to restructure Brisby's deal, but
agent Michael George has resisted.
</P>
<P>
   Rucci's agent, Jack Bechta, said, ``As long as other starters
are being paid in Todd's range, I see no reason to restructure the
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bechta is concerned about Rucci returning to the Patriots,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally and emotionally,'' said Bechta, ``Todd and his
fiancee were planning on living in Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, of the five Patriots on the list, the most logical to be
taken was Rucci, a younger veteran whose salary was high but not
enormous. The Browns made Detroit Lions center Jim Pyne, at $1.85
million, their top pick, and the salaries of players chosen
thereafter seemed to decline rapidly until the Browns took 49ers
cornerback Antonio Langham and his $3.02 million salary at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear that the Browns' objective was to take younger
players with smaller salaries,'' said Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Collons, whose salary rises from $535,000 to $2 million next
season, with a $725,000 bonus due March 1, may not be back. The
Patriots put him on the list because they didn't want to pay that
large an increase in his salary. Two years ago, the Philadelphia
Eagles made Collons a big offer as a restricted free agent and the
Patriots matched it, feeling they couldn't do without him at the
time. But since then, Chris Sullivan has supplanted Collons as the
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, the first player selected with a Bill Parcells
compensation pick (third round in 1997), hasn't blossomed as
Patriots vice president Bobby Grier had hoped. Shaw did come to
camp last summer with a better attitude, but it became evident that
Edwards was a better player and he easily took the starting job
after the first week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots attempted to use Shaw as a kick returner, but he
never showed the ability to break one. Late in the year, after Shaw
had a meeting with Grier, he began to play more to give Edwards a
break.
</P>
<P>
   Had Edwards not been injured, Shaw would have been left exposed.

WHEN DAD NEEDS TIME OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since winning the first gender bias case brought under the 1993
Family and Medical Leave Act last week, H. Kevin Knussman has been
pursued by the media.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Kim, 36, appeared on ``Good Morning America.''
The Associated Press sent reports on his victory over national news
wires on Thursday. People magazine interviewed the Knussmans at
their Maryland home on Friday, and Time magazine spoke to the
couple while they were in New York for their appearance on morning
TV.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone calls, letters, messages, and requests for
interviews haven't stopped coming. Naturally, all this attention
has caused the Knussmans to conclude (rightly) that many US
workplaces still have trouble accepting working dads who need time
off for family business. More than five years after the FMLA's
enactment, that kind of devotion still can sabotage a man's career.
</P>
<P>
   Knussman (pronounced Ka-noose-man), a 41-year-old father of two
children who works as a helicopter paramedic, sued the Maryland
State Police in 1994 after it denied him three months leave
following the birth of his daughter. Although he was given 10 days,
Knussman later requested more time after his wife developed
complications due to childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a jury awarded Knussman $375,000 in damages for
mental anguish in the first sex discrimination case filed under
FMLA. Meanwhile, attorneys for the Maryland State Police, which
operates the helicopter paramedic unit, are considering an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim Knussman developed pregnancy induced hypertension and, as
a result, the baby was three weeks early,'' noted Debbie Jeon, an
American Civil Liberties Union attorney who represented Knussman.
``Then, he got a teletyped message about a new Maryland law that
provides 30 days of paid sick leave if the employee is the primary
provider. But the state police said no again. People also said,
`Unless your wife is dead or in a coma, you could not be the
primary provider.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Other off-the-wall comments from supervisors included: ``God
made women to have babies, not men'' and ``men cannot breast
feed.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Knussman said she was disturbed by all the comments and
controversy, but when she thought long and hard about it, she
wasn't really surprised. ``Fathers take a big, big risk,'' she said
in an interview. ``A lot of men have gone through this. They're
forced to sneak out of their offices to go out and pick up their
children for fear of retribution. It's so tragic . . . A lot of
employers don't realize times have changed. Women are now
breadwinners, too. There's equality now. Family leave isn't just
for women, it's also for men.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Knussman faired better at the Maryland State Police when
his wife delivered their second child in 1996. ``They did exactly
what they should have done the first time,'' he said. ``I was
permitted 12 weeks leave with pay, leave that I had accumulated
already.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one at work has congratulated him on his good fortune,
probably because of fear or possibly because of anger for rocking
the boat. ``I guess there is still a good bit of reluctance on
people's parts,'' Knussman said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his colleagues may feel, there is an awful lot of
sympathy from the outside for the Knussmans. Just about everyone
can attest to the importance of the FMLA, but problems still arise,
particularly for males at firms where leave-taking is considered a
woman-only affair. ``There are still many places where fathers
cannot honestly ask for support with respect to family matters,''
said Robin Hardman, spokeswoman for the Families and Work Institute
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   When the institute surveyed more than 1,000 US firms with 100 or
more employees last year, it found that companies with a high
number of women or minorities in senior positions were more likely
to support workers who have family responsibilities. Among the
industries most likely to disapprove? The retail industry, the
institute said. Those most likely to approve of it? Financial
services.
</P>
<P>
   The institute reports that those most likely to offer at least
12 weeks of paternity leave are companies with more than 250
workers or large numbers of unionized employees. Not surprising,
the study also showed maternity leave is more acceptable than
paternity leave, even though companies are legally bound to provide
either to any worker who needs time off. In all, 53 percent of the
companies surveyed offered time off for maternity leave with
replacement pay of some kind. For paternity leave, however, it was
only 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies give workers 12 weeks of unpaid paternity leave
as required by the federal law, but 10 percent offer fewer than 12
weeks and 2 percent do not even comply with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there has been progress: Thirteen percent of all firms
with more than 100 employees now offer 13 to 26 weeks of unpaid
paternity leave. And, 3 percent offer more than 26 weeks of unpaid
paternity leave. A handful, such as Boston-based consultants WFD
Inc., go further. They offer four weeks of paid paternity leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``At WFD, there has always been support for me to take the full,
four weeks of leave,'' said Paul Rupert, leader of WFD's
Flexibility Consulting Practice. ``But I did not take all of it
because of client pressures. There is still the assumption that
women take maternity leave, and they do it because it is related to
the pregnancy. But it is also true that those first few weeks are
chaos, and people are simply exhausted, which is also true of men.
. . I actually had clients call me up while I was on paternity
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 Catalyst study of dual-career couples found that more
than 70 percent of the respondents, including 67 percent of the
men, would require the family leave benefit from a new employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men definitely perceive that there will be a negative
repercussion to their career,'' said Nancy Kane, a senior associate
at Catalyst, the New York research organization. ``They are not
considered players when they take family leave. Typically, they
will use vacation days for new births and other personal or medical
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those high-level executives or politicians whose
departure from their careers for family reasons drew so much
attention a few years ago, Kane noted: ``That happens all too
infrequently. The truth is, there are really few role models in the
senior ranks who use the FMLA.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be even fewer who are willing to admit they were late
because the baby-sitter did not show up.

EX-SCHOOLMATES REMEMBER A KING IN THE MAKING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He waited on tables, vacuumed rugs, made his bed, shot pool,
chewed tobacco, obeyed curfew, captained the wrestling team, and
often played a prank that would trigger an international crisis
today.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's newly crowned king, during his formative years at
boarding school in Western Massachusetts, delighted in his ability
to ditch his well-armed bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he could scare them,'' recalled Jim Smith, a coach and
instructor at Deerfield Academy when King Abdullah of Jordan was
just a boy and a prince. ``He was a rascal. But he was a wonderful
young man.''
</P>
<P>
   That man, who watched somberly Monday as his 63-year-old
father's shroud-wrapped body was lowered into a grave at the royal
cemetery in Amman, Jordan, has indicated he will continue his
father's moderate policies _ a task for which his western friends
and former schoolmates said he is well-prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, they said, has always exceeded the expectations of
headmasters and coaches, teachers and proctors, and kings and
queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always known Abdullah to be extremely wise,'' said
Christopher Smith, one of the king's closest friends at Deerfield
and a guest at his 1993 wedding. ``He was more mature really than
people of our age when we were growing up. I've always known him to
be compassionate. This is a man who is truly genuine and eager to
take advice from wherever it may come.''
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old father of two was first sent off to boarding
school in England when he was 4. But most of his youth was spent in
Western Massachusetts, where in 1977 he enrolled as a sophomore at
Deerfield, where the boys wear ties, today's tuition is $23,500,
and even princes are expected to toe the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met Abdullah, he was beautifully attired in his
best Seville Row clothing, and I said, `Young man, do you know how
to run a vacuum cleaner?' '' said Bryce Lambert, a now-retired
English teacher. ``And he said, `I've Hoovered.' I told him to keep
on `Hoovering' because he was moving into the cleanest dormitory at
Deerfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert said Toni Gardiner, Abdullah's English-born mother and
the second wife of King Hussein, told Deerfield faculty members
that she was intent on raising her son to ensure that he could take
care of himself if his father ever suffered a reversal of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   That meant, with the exception of the beefy security guards who
waited outside his classrooms and accompanied the team bus to
sporting events, that Abdullah was treated like any other student
in a school whose alumni include US senators, Nobel laureates,
acclaimed authors, and titans of industry.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Smith, whose duties at the school included running its
dining hall, recalled how Abdullah feigned indignation when it was
his turn to wait on tables, a duty expected of every Deerfield
student.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up to me and said, `I think it's a shame that the
prince of Jordan has to wait on tables,' '' Smith recalled. ``It
was tongue in cheek, you know. And I grabbed him by the necktie and
I said, `Your old man might be king of Jordan, but I'm king of this
dining hall.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, when the prince put up a large contingent of
American friends at a plush Jordanian hotel for his wedding, he
greeted Smith at the airport, telling him: ``I wanted another king
at my wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I see him today and I think, God bless him, he's really got it
in his lap now,'' said Smith. ``We know this is a kid who can do
it. I'm sure he's going to rise to the challenge. Being an old
football coach I just want to say to him, `You know, kiddo, it's
now the second half. Get out there and give it your best.' And I
know that's exactly what he's going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Smith, a Connecticut native and now an advertising
copy writer in Los Angeles, said he has turned down national
television interviews because he did not want to risk saying
anything that could be misinterpreted about his close friend and
old classmate, now a key figure in the fragile world of Mideast
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abdullah has many of the same qualities that his dad did,
including that great human ability to touch people without making a
big deal of who he was,'' Smith said. ``At the same time, Abdullah
has always had the confidence and natural leadership ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Their friendship, Smith said, was cemented by the unwritten rule
that the prince's station in life would command him no special
deference except for intense loyalty and protection of his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the occasions when Abdullah had to be the prince, it was
instantly clear that he was prepared and capable of acccepting the
mantle of responsibility,'' said Smith, who as a 17-year-old
acompanied his friend to his native land. ``When I witnessed him
meeting with dignitaries and the people of Jordan, he had a direct
way of communicating and still had a very common touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert said he recently sent a letter to Abdullah, who as a boy
lived with him at the 1760 Ephraim Williams House, where they shot
pool and watched football games together. The letter, he said, was
to encourage the new king during trying, transitional times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had such a great sense of humor, and I wrote him and I
said, `Whatever you do, don't let them take that wonderful smile
away from you that you always had at Deerfield,' '' Lambert said.
``It was interesting to watch him today as he carried himself with
such dignity and then to think of the times I'd beat him in pool.''

LASER BEAM DESTROYS A NAVY CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lt. Jack Daly is looking for some answers to a mysterious laser
incident 22 months ago that left him in constant pain and has
wrecked a once-promising career in U.S. naval intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Daly was serving as a liaison officer to the Canadian Maritime
Defense Force at Esquimalt, B.C., in the spring of 1997 when he
went on a routine surveillance flight to photograph a Russian
freighter suspected by U.S. and Canadian officials of snooping on
the Trident ballistic missile submarines based at Bangor, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   While photographing the M/V Kapitan Man, Daly and the Canadian
helicopter pilot, Capt. Pat Barnes, were struck by a laser beam
that caused serious lesions to their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a pain-free day since the incident,'' Daly said
in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Daly is scheduled to tell his story to a congressional
committee examining the threat to military personnel from lasers
and other high-tech weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., has summoned the intelligence and
research chiefs from each of the four armed services to testify
about high-tech weaponry and the Pentagon's proposed
countermeasures. Hunter, chairman of the House Armed Services
procurement subcommittee, is also concerned about alleged espionage
by Russian commercial ships inside U.S. waters, according to his
press secretary, Harald Stavanas.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, a 40-year-old Philadelphia native, says he is glad to have
the opportunity to testify about laser threats, particularly since
two U.S. military personnel in Bosnia were similarly injured in
Bosnia last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But his satisfaction is bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career is down the toilet,'' said Daly, who enlisted in the
Navy in 1982 and won an officer's commission seven years later. He
said his downfall came after he and Canadian officials submitted
incident reports on the April 4, 1997, laser firing.
</P>
<P>
   The Kapitan Man was five miles west of Port Angeles in the
eastbound shipping lanes of the Strait of Juan de Fuca when the
Canadian helicopter bearing Daly and Barnes approached to take
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the laser burn symptoms appeared the next morning,
the ship had entered the Port of Tacoma to unload and take on
cargo, Daly and Barnes said in separate interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon ordered a search of the ship but the boarding team
didn't appear until more than 72 hours had gone by, Daly said. No
evidence of a laser was found.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent Pentagon investigation confirmed the two officers
had been struck by a laser beam but said it could not determine
whether the laser was fired from the Russian ship.
</P>
<P>
   Daly claims the investigation into the incident was poorly
conducted and that it tried to disprove that the two men had been
injured by a laser. He filed an official report challenging its
findings. Since then, Daly says, he has been passed over for
promotion and faces the likelihood of having to retire from active
duty later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials would not comment on whether there was
political pressure to warn the Russians of the search and downplay
the incident, as Daley claims.
</P>
<P>
   Several other intelligence officials, who requested anonymity,
have said the Kapitan Man and other ships in the Russian Far
Eastern Shipping Co. fleet have attempted to track Trident
submarines ever since Puget Sound ports were opened to vessels from
the former Soviet Union eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., says he has received briefings
confirming the Pentagon's suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Daly alleged the Pentagon and the Canadian military halted the
surveillance flights of the Russian ships immediately after the
1997 laser incident.
</P>
<P>
   One senior member of the staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at
the time told the Post-Intelligencer there was ``a great desire to
have this incident go away'' because the Clinton administration was
concerned about its relations with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Daly has undergone extensive treatment for the burns to his eyes
at the Brook Army Medical Center in Texas. He says it is not known
whether his eyes will fully heal or whether the pain from the
lesions will subside.

CELLUCCI COP-OUT WON'T HELP DSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Massachusetts families in crisis need an advocate. Governor Paul
Cellucci is sending them a cop.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Jeffrey A. Locke as interim commissioner of
the state Department of Social Services confirms the worst fears of
those who worry that this administration does not know the
difference between child protection and parental prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Locke is a career prosecutor, the former head of a
white-collar-crime unit in the Middlesex district attorney's office
and a specialist in drug cases in the US attorney's office. He has
no background in social work, no experience in child welfare
administration, no record on the divisive issues he will confront
as head of an embattled agency that handles more than 100,000
complaints of abuse or neglect every year.
</P>
<P>
   What he does have is strong Republican ties, and time on his
hands. He is the son of former state Senate Minority Leader David
Locke and the brother of state Representative John Locke. He lost
his campaign for Norfolk district attorney last fall and was then
passed over by Cellucci for public safety secretary. He is said to
be angling for a judgeship, though he denies any such lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Locke's personal merits, it is clear that politics and
public relations played a bigger role than policy considerations in
his selection. Coming on the heels of two high-profile raids on
allegedly neglectful households, the appointment of Locke will
reinforce long-held suspicions on the street that the mission of
DSS is to take your kids, not to help your family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first job is keeping kids safe,'' Locke said Tuesday. ``I
don't think my experience as a prosecutor is a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency, under fire for failing to remove five children from
squalid conditions in Everett, last weekend pulled a total of 10
children out of homes in Methuen and Framingham, citing unsanitary
conditions. This was a coincidence? Does the governor think we do
not recognize damage control when we see it? Does he think reactive
measures are a substitute for a genuine child-protection
philosophy?
</P>
<P>
   In trying to stem the flow of bad ink about DSS, Cellucci
continues to ignore the underlying cause of the hemorrhaging. This
is a department at war with itself. One blue-ribbon commission
after another in the last decade has studied the problems plaguing
DSS, only to have their recommendations ignored or underfunded. The
outgoing commissioner, with no frontline experience in social work
herself, was unable in six years to form an alliance with the
caseworkers she was expected to manage. Caseworkers, scapegoated by
those at the top, resort to practicing defensive social work rather
than risk having their decisions second-guessed on the 6 o'clock
news.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cellucci insisted on Monday, DSS is ``not in crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his record, it is hard to understand why the governor
would think we would take his word for that. During his campaign
against Scott Harshbarger last fall, he refused to participate in a
debate on issues affecting children or even to respond to
pre-election questionnaires about those issues.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Jeffrey Locke is more realistic about the
challenge he is undertaking. ``We certainly have a department that
could use some direction,'' he said. ``I bring an outsider's
perspective, a common-sense approach that, in the interim, might
get the place on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Locke anticipates he will serve no longer than six months,
during which time the Cellucci administration will conduct one of
those ``nationwide'' searches that too often unearth the perfect
job candidate right there on Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Locke should pick up where the last Foster Care Commission left
off. That panel pulled dozens of DSS cases at random for review by
an independent team of experts. Expecting to find a handful of
troublesome cases, the commission instead found widespread problems
with resources and referrals indicative of a systemwide breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Why not repeat the experiment? If, as the governor insists, the
Everett ``house of horrors'' was just an aberration, we will all
feel reassured. If not, perhaps Paul Cellucci might see the wisdom
of having the state's child welfare agency run by a social worker,
not a cop.

THE RACIST LINKS AROUND TRENT LOTT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1992, the Council of Conservative Citizens said Trent Lott
told them, ``The people in this room stand for the right principles
and the right philosophy. Let's take it in the right direction and
our children will be the beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement is loaded since Lott, now the Senate majority
leader and a key shaper of the nation's agenda, spoke at other
council events in the 1990s, including two fund-raisers for an
all-white school that was founded to avoid school desgregation.
</P>
<P>
   It remains loaded because Lott condemned the council only after
his links were exposed. He has not explained his comfort with men
who used mailing lists from the old racist Citizens Councils to
build membership. Lott's uncle, council executive board member
Arnie Watson, said ``Trent is an honorary member.''
</P>
<P>
   It is loaded because of the list of ominous Internet sites that
agree with the Mississippi Republican that the council stands for
the ``right principles and the right philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the Nationalist Observer, a site ``for activists in the
struggle to secure the White Race's survival and advancement.'' The
site says, ``We believe the Aryan Struggle to be an elite one. . .
. We support the Unity of our movement and the revolutionizing of
our spirit into a combined force to take back control of our Race's
destiny, by any means necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The Observer has what it describes as the ``World's Largest
Racist Link List.'' Under ``White Racial Links,'' along with links
for the Ku Klux Klan, the Aryan Nation, and skinheads, the Observer
lists the Council of Conservative Citizens. The council is called
a, ``Semi-racist political pressure group.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the Web page for Politically Incorrect. This site calls
itself ``Grand Central Station for White Nationalists.''
</P>
<P>
   An editorial titled ``Whites Fighting Back'' says ``You will
find the pro-white activities of the Council of Conservative
Citizens and the Nationalist Movement encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   This is enlightening to have an editorial praise the council and
the Nationalist Movement in the same breath. The Nationalist
Movement says ``all efforts to make us a bi-lingual, bi-sexual or
bi-racial society must be defeated.'' The Movement is the Web home
for skinheads. Skinheads have beaten and killed several people of
color in their effort to ``Take America Back.''
</P>
<P>
   That editorial also listed as sources for ``positive action''
former Klansman-turned-politician David Duke, sites that question
the existence of the Jewish Holocaust, and William Pierce, who
fantasizes about angry white men bombing US government buildings
and lynching people of color and white women who cohabitate with
black men. Pierce's ``Turner Diaries'' was a favorite of Oklahoma
City bomber Timothy McVeigh.
</P>
<P>
   The Council has a hotlink to American Renaissance, which pushes
the intellectual superiority of white people. American
Renaissance's hotlink back to the council says the C of CC is ``the
foremost conservative organization in America.''
</P>
<P>
   The council and a Web page called Southern Independence have
hotlinks to each other. Southern Independence lists the council
under ``Freedom Fighters,'' with the Southern Legal Resource
Center, which screams ``Stop the Ethnic Cleansing of Dixie!''
</P>
<P>
   Southern Independence prominently posts a declaration made by
white heritage groups in New Albany, Miss., in 1996. It says that
multiculturalism is ``genocide against Western peoples . . . we
believe equality is the sworn enemy of liberty. . . . the assertion
of equality among races, sexes and moral belief systems is
contradicted by every shred of natural evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   A choice quotation by Southern Independence, from the Charleston
Mercury in 1865, said the Civil War reduced white men ``to the
level of a nigger and a nigger is raised to his level. . . .
Gracious God! Is this what our brave soldierery are fighting for?
To reduce themselves to the level and companionship of niggers? No,
no, never, not in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   (The publication here of the N-word may offend some readers, but
I feel it is necessary here to communicate the mentality of the Web
page.)
</P>
<P>
   It may be of mere coincidence that the New Albany Declaration
was made the same year Lott became Senate majority leader. But it
is impossible to think Lott was ignorant of such bigotry. American
Renaissance has a hotlink to a site called The Last Ditch. A
passage in The Last Ditch says, ``Just as a hothead can learn to
control his temper, and an alcoholic his alcoholism (typically by
total abstinence,) so also can a typical Negro male . . . moderate
his sexual aggressiveness through a continuing act of focus or by
diverting his energies into work or sports.''
</P>
<P>
   This is strikingly similar in tone to a statement Lott made last
year condemning homosexuality. Lott said, ``You should try to show
them a way to deal with that problem, just like alcohol . . . or
sex addiction . . . or kleptomaniacs . . . you should try to work
with that person to learn to control that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   This should make America ask what Lott means by ``the right
principles and the right philosophy.'' He condemned the council,
but he has offered no apology about his speeches to them. This
leaves his words so loaded, it is an open question whether the
leader of the Senate is bigotry's walking bomb.

AS SITE FOR CONVENTION, HUB COUNTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO &UR;  &LR; _ The finalists have showcased their assets and
soft-pedaled their liabilities, but as the Democratic National
Committee decides where to hold its 2000 national convention,
numbers matter.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates, alternates, and hangers-on need to get there, then
find a place to meet and a place to sleep. The numbers are kept by
PKF Consulting, leading analysts of the hospitality business. The
numbers-crunchers at Parnell, Kerr, and Forrester, headquartered
here, tabulate hopes and dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really makes money from a big political convention, but
it does give you exposure,'' says Gary L. Carr, PKF's director of
communications. ``Planning for a big convention goes through a
nuts-and-bolts process that asks three basic questions. One, how
big is the convention center? Two, how many hotel rooms does the
city have? Three, is there good airline access?''
</P>
<P>
   If proximity and efficiency of the airport dominated, Boston
could weave the bunting now. But the size of the hall and the
number of mattresses are powerful, too. PVF's 1998 report finds the
following:
</P>
<P>
   Boston's convention center is 193,000 square feet. It has 12,220
rooms and 22,000 in Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Denver's convention center is 297,000 square feet. The airport
sits in a distant prairie, and Denver has 4,800 hotel rooms
downtown and 17,200 in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the convention center is 894,000 square feet.
While the leading airport, LAX, is frequently fogged in, the City
of the Angels has 92,350 hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Boston argues that the Fleet Center could serve as a big hall
and claims that more hotels are en route, too. ``People who plan
conventions are really uneasy about these things. They want to know
if a facility is up and running,'' Carr says. ``It would be nice if
Boston had that extra square footage, but right now it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But PKF's senior vice president, John A. Fox, sees a bright
future for Boston's convention business even if new hotels are
stalled by politics and financing. (The hotel phrase, ``turn-down
service,'' takes on a perverse meaning in Boston, where bankers and
politicians ignore or oppose projects that provide economic
stability.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In the investment community's view, the break-even point in
hotels is an occupancy rate in the high 60s,'' Fox says. ``Boston's
rate is close to 80 percent. To be precise, in 1998, it was 78.8
percent, with an average room rate of $177.65. That puts Boston
right up there with the highest rates in the Northeast, right
behind New York and Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very healthy occupancy level and one of the highest
that Boston has run for some time,'' says Fox, who has studied the
hotel business since 1971. He suggests that convention centers and
hotels share prospects for a long life. ``We're not looking at the
next quarter, but 20 to 30 years,'' he says. ``Step back and take a
look. Faneuil Hall and the waterfront were all undeveloped in the
early '70s. State Street office building hadn't happened. Boston
had that significant tourist component, the whole historical thing,
but now Boston is known as a much more urbane, sophisticated
business center.''
</P>
<P>
   Geography once dominated convention choices, which explains why
Democrats and Republicans have assembled in Chicago 25 times.
Baltimore is the runner-up, but the Crabcake City last held a
convention in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolic choices are sometimes successful. Republicans met in
Detroit in 1980 to suggest that the GOP was a pal of working
stiffs, even if the choice meant that some delegations stayed in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Denver, where Democrats met in 1908, and Los Angeles, host to
Democrats in 1960, are trying for their second conventions. But
important politics happened in Boston, in 1775. Numbers matter, but
the ``historical thing'' that describes Boston also defines much of
America. In 2000, it would mean more than a mint on the pillow.
</P>

A STEP CLOSER TO PROTESTANT UNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An important religious event took place in St. Louis recently _
and it wasn't Pope John Paul II's whirlwind 30-hour tour through
the Midwestern city on the banks of the Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   In a significant meeting largely overshadowed by the pontiff's
visit, representatives from nine Protestant denominations,
representing 20 million members, convened in St. Louis and moved
one step closer to realizing a 37-year-old goal of forging a united
Christian body.
</P>
<P>
   The Consultation on Church Unity was born out of a desire to
fulfill a Biblical mandate summarized in the book of Ephesians:
``There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God.''
</P>
<P>
   As the report issued at the end of the meeting noted, ``the
unity we seek to manifest is not our choice but God's gift.'' But
living up to the words in Ephesians has been difficult for
denominations with long histories of strained relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have figured after all these years that folks would
have quit, but they didn't, and I think they are going to be
rewarded for it,'' said the Rev. Ed Rodman of the Episcopal Diocese
of Massachusetts, who attended the meeting late last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to divisions among the churches that have, in
many instances, existed for hundreds of years it should not be
surprising that it takes a good number of years to heal those
divisions,'' said the Rev. Diane C. Kessler, executive director of
the Massachusetts Council of Churches, who also was at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   For people in the pews, the agreement among the nine mainline
denominations may eventually mean this: exchanging clergy for
Sunday services; having one universally recognized baptism, and
pooling resources by, for example, combining youth groups and
sharing a youth minister.
</P>
<P>
   These would be big steps considering that in many communities
there is still little collaboration among Protestant churches of
different denominations, even though the churches typically share
very similar theological roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even something that would seem so simple as picking up the
phone can be a big deal for people,'' Kessler said. ``That's what
makes this kind of ecumenical work so challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, a more closely allied Protestant body also might
bring renewed vigor and political clout to mainline denominations
whose influence in wider American society has been steadily
declining for the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   By the year 2002, according to the agreement hammered out in St.
Louis, the nine denominations would publicly proclaim that they
have joined together to form a new religious body _ Churches
Uniting in Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later the denominations would agree to accept each
other's clergy _ a step that is still uncertain because of
disagreements over the office of bishop, which is central to the
Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this agreement were to come to pass it would literally
reverse the Reformation, which led to the fragmentation of
Christianity,'' Rodman said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most difficult obstacles on the road to Christian
unity is the issue of race and racism.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the nine denominations _ the African Methodist
Episcopal Church, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church and
the Christian Methodist Episcopal Churches are among denominations
that exist because blacks were not welcome in white churches. And
the vast majority of the nation's churches are still racially
distinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really can't talk about becoming one until we deal with
racism,'' said the Rev. Gregory Groover, pastor of Charles Street
A.M.E. in Boston, who represented the African Methodist Episcopal
Church in St. Louis. ``If there is one factor that really separates
us more than doctrine, more than theology, more than tradition, it
is race.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine denominations committed themselves to overcoming the
legacy of racism by signing an agreement to, among other things,
identify and end church practices that smack of prejudice and
actively promote the integration of congregations.
</P>
<P>
   The other congregations participating in the Consultation on
Church Union are the Episcopal Church, Presbyterian Church U.S.A.,
the United Church of Christ, the United Methodist Church, the
Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and the International
Council of Community Churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a lot of hard work but I'm very excited about
this,'' Groover said. ``I do believe in Scripture and I do believe
it is the will of Christ that we should be one.''
</P>

Religion Notes
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the defender of Roman Catholic
doctrine and one of Pope John Paul II's closest confidantes, will
come to the United States to discuss the controversial issues of
homosexuality and feminism with bishops.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, starting Wednesday, Feb. 10, will take place in San
Francisco, a stronghold for the gay rights and women's movements,
both of which have criticized the Vatican's position on
homosexuality and the role of women in the church.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican considers homosexuality a sin and opposes same-sex
unions and allowing gay couples to legally adopt children. The
church also has tried to shut the door on debate on whether woman
can be priests.
</P>
<P>
   Ratzinger, a conservative intellectual who has punished liberal
clergy and Catholic theologians, is scheduled to meet with bishops
from North America and Pacific islands.
</P>
<P>
   --Several hundred clergy members across the nation have signed a
petition calling on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to respect
human rights as a necessary step to achieving peace in the Middle
East. The petition is sponsored by the Search for Justice and
Equality in Palestine/Israel in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   --The Massachusetts Historical Commission has awarded the Old
North Church a $100,000 preservation grant to finance the
restoration of two historic church properties.

THE ONES WE LIKE ARE THE ONES LIKE US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The screenwriter Nora Ephron has made a great deal of money
exploiting the premise that a scrawny, shambolic guy with a
receding hairline (Tom Hanks) can hook up with Ms. Wholesome
Suburban Glamorpuss (Meg Ryan) through a random series of events.
In Ephron's ``Sleepless in Seattle,'' the pair met on a radio
call-in show. In ``You've Got Mail,'' they meet via the most random
medium yet invented _ the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The run-up to Valentine's Day provides fertile ground for
Hollywood hankie jobs extolling the chanciness of true love. In the
just-released ``Message in a Bottle,'' yet another megastar with a
hair problem (Kevin Costner) links up with a gorgeous, blond Boston
newspaper columnist, thanks to Neptune's nautical note-bearing
network.
</P>
<P>
   New story same as the old story. Noel Coward worked this
territory in his screenplay for David Lean's enchanting ``Brief
Interlude,'' in which Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard make love (in
the old-fashioned sense of the phrase) in a suburban train station.
It is certainly romantic to imagine that chance encounters at
commuter stops lead to true love, that Internet chat rooms aren't
populated only with sickos and pedophiles, or that messages loosed
upon the waters will be retrieved by drop-dead blondes hankering
for romance.
</P>
<P>
   It is romantic, but not very realistic.
</P>
<P>
   What better time to dust off the lecture on assortative mating,
or how men and women really find their partners? Assortative mating
is the opposite of random mating. Like, say, the otters, we humans
climbed off the ark with one purpose in mind: to make the world a
better place. If you think this means being nice to your neighbors,
pledging money to public television, and voting Democratic, you are
wrong. It means strengthening our gene pool.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish this, we select mates whose characteristics match
our own. This is called positive assortative mating and is probably
the main reason why the chimpanzees were reduced to bit parts in
the movie ``Jumanji,'' while we humans produced it.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists, biologists, anthropologists _ the whole science
gang _ have known for several decades that men and women who marry
tend to have similar IQs, comparable waistlines, a predetermined
height ratio, and even correlate positively for earlobe length.
People with nice teeth marry other people with nice teeth. The rich
marry the rich. Random mating would be disastrous for the gene
pool, as even Hollywood acknowledges. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks
correlate positively on many different indices, not least of which
is asking price per picture.
</P>
<P>
   This subject is close to my heart because I am a victim of
positive assortative mating. When my wife and I tell friends that
we met in the Country Formerly Known as the USSR, we hear the
inevitable reaction: ``Oooh, how romantic!'' Not really. After a
small amount of informational foreplay, we learned that we had
grown up in the same quadrant of the same city and even attended
the same grade school. Indeed, our third-grade teacher came to our
wedding and gave us Ernst Mayr's classic ``Populations, Species and
Evolution'' as a wedding present. (Just kidding about the present.)
</P>
<P>
   The dream dies hard. The largest-selling category of books in
the country is romance. These novels often focus on what the
science gang calls negative assortative mating _ the forbidden
couplings of field hand and mistress of the house, or the
impossible liaisons of lord and scullery maid. People love to read
them because they have so little to do with real life.
</P>
<P>
   It is surely no accident that the most ``romantic'' relationship
in Western literature is an example of positive assortative mating.
Romeo and Juliet were both marriageable teenagers from noble
families in Verona. It would have been a very dull wedding.

ALFREDO IN WONDERLAND 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In his 41 years in the fashion business,
designer Alfred Fiandaca has catered to every kind of lady who
lunches, from Joan Rivers to Joan Collins to Joan Bennett Kennedy.
Still, even this seasoned friend-of-the-prima-donna didn't know
what to think of the devastated client he found crying on his
boutique doorstep here early one morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darling, what's wrong?'' he exclaimed, in his soft
stage-whisper voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alfred, I couldn't sleep all night!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sick?'' Fiandaca asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what came over me Tuesday,'' she said, sniffling.
``I don't know why I ordered chiffon ruffles on my dress rather
than crepe. I hate chiffon!''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Fiandaca's winter wonderland. It's another world down
here; almost a throwback in time. Wealthy women spend their days
shopping, lunching, and then shopping again to prepare for a
whirlwind of at least three charity parties every night of the week
during the social season.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these women are so concerned about image that they
refuse to wear the same dress twice in one season, or even in
subsequent winters. ``I'll pull a dress out in a few years.
Definitely not the next year,'' says Eileen Cornacchia, a Palm
Beach resident and race-horse owner who attends 15 black-tie events
a year.
</P>
<P>
   In this circle, department store shopping isn't an option
because it's imperative to have a dressmaker who keeps track of who
among the who's who bought which gown. ``This is a small town,''
says Joanne Cutner, associate publisher of the local Palm Beach
Society weekly magazine and a Fiandaca customer. ``The worst thing
is to see someone else in your dress.''
</P>
<P>
   So this explains why Fiandaca _ a 60-year-old East Boston, Mass.
native _ winters here rather than near his stores on Boston's
Newbury Street or Madison Avenue in New York. ``Women work in New
York,'' he says. ``They don't have time to shop. Here, women need a
new outfit every night.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic, really, that, amid such a harvest of evening-gown
wearers with money, Fiandaca would be disenchanted. But frankly, he
finds Palm Beach confining. He literally can't go anywhere without
bumping into someone he knows. Virtually all conversation revolves
around money (Who has it and where did they get it) and image (Has
she had a facelift? Who did it? Is she the second or third wife?
Which beachfront property do they own?).
</P>
<P>
   Women introduce themselves the old-fashioned way, by their
husband's name. ``I'm Mrs. William Ireland,'' said one Fiandaca
client visiting his shop recently.
</P>
<P>
   And the party circuit is so ingrained in the city's culture that
even Fiandaca's doorman gets excited when the designer's picture
appears in Palm Beach Society.
</P>
<P>
   Fiandaca _ who spends his evenings with friends when he's in New
York or Boston _ is literally obligated to attend client functions
or dinner parties five nights a week here. ``If the co-chair or
chair of an event is wearing my gown, I have to buy a ticket,'' he
says. ``That's how you drum up business.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Fiandaca isn't complaining. After all, the designer
_ who specializes in day and evening women's wear that can be
customized by fabric, color, and design _ relies on these women for
his livelihood and personal fulfillment. ``This is my passion. Take
this away and you take my life away,'' he says. ``A day without the
next collection would be like a day without the sun. . . . Watching
a woman feel wonderful about herself, that's a joy. It's worth the
price of admission.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this isn't hard labor. Over the course of a recent
weekend, Fiandaca's workload included attending a Friday night
cocktail party at Connoisseur Antiques. Standing in a room filled
with glittering $6,000- to-$180,000 antique European chandeliers, a
dapper Fiandaca _ dressed in a beige Italian suit and yellow Hermes
tie _ sips champagne and munches on shrimp hors d'oeuvres. When
someone asks ``Do you know the lord?'' he doesn't even blink; he
quickly extends his hand. (Jesus? No, Lord Peter Knowland of
Alswick _ Belgium).
</P>
<P>
   The next day, as he and two clients stroll down Worth Avenue (an
upscale boulevard featuring the likes of Chanel, Tiffany &AMP; Co., and
Louis Vuitton), Fiandaca patiently smiles as the two women gossip:
</P>
<P>
   Customer 1: ``Have you been lifted? (That's face-lifted.) You
definitely look different. Not that you looked bad before.''
</P>
<P>
   Customer 2: ``I just had my eyes done. I did the lift last year.
I'm almost too tight.'' She doesn't bother to mention, although
Fiandaca knows, that she's also just had her lips done, which is
why she's talking through her teeth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That evening, Fiandaca keeps a straight face during the pomp and
circumstance of the International Red Cross Ball, the No. 1 party
of the year here, according to some socialites.
</P>
<P>
   For the big event, the designer is picked up at home in a
chauffeur-driven white Jaguar by his date and client Emily DiMaggio
(the wife of former Red Sox Dominic DiMaggio, who didn't want to go
to the ball). ``We're going to have fun tonight!'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Walking through the lobby of The Breakers Hotel, as hotel guests
stop and stare, Fiandaca (in a white tie and tuxedo tails) and
DiMaggio (in a pink-and-red Fiandaca sheath gown) are greeted by
three men in red-velvet medieval costumes who blow trumpets to
announce their arrival.

 PALM BEACH, Fla.: ... their arrival.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The couple pass through a receiving line where nine US
ambassadors to Bosnia, Romania, Sweden, Columbia and other
countries (who are the recipients of Red Cross funds) shake hands
stiffly, alongside their tiara-wearing wives. ``It's considered
tacky to wear a tiara if you're not in the (ambassadorial) court,''
he whispers, referring to other tiara wearers in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Then the real program begins. A Marine color guard enters the
grand ballroom (decorated in fragrant roses, orchids, and lilies)
and all guests rise. Then they sit. Then they stand as the
ambassadors are announced one by one. Then the guests sit. Then
they stand for the national anthem and Fiandaca can't contain
himself. ``This is like going to Catholic Mass,'' he quips.
</P>
<P>
   But his efforts pay off. The following Monday, a picture of
Fiandaca and DiMaggio appears on the front page of The Palm Beach
Daily News in a story about how DiMaggio dropped a $4,000 brooch
from local jeweler Seaman Schepps at the ball. ``There's no way you
can pay for that kind of publicity,'' he says.

   It's funny that Fiandaca is now traveling in the circles his
father envisioned for him when he encouraged him to become a doctor
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiandaca family has been stitching for three generations.
His grandfather Alfred designed women's clothing for a company on
Boylston Street. His father, Pasquile, designed men's suits for a
Cambridge store. And his mother, Adeline, designed costumes for
local performers. Working in his father's store at 12 years old,
Alfred says, ``I learned tailoring there and pattern drafting.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fiandaca says he was never interested in men's clothes.
``Working with my dad, it was the same old suit: two-button,
three-button, single-breasted, double-breasted . . . With women's
clothes there is so much more drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiandaca attended the now defunct Traphagen School of Design in
New York in 1956. At 19, he returned to East Boston and rented an
empty shop on Maverick Street for $25 a month. ``My dad knew all
these men, so he sent me the wives,'' he says. Before long, a woman
named Jennie Volpe showed up. Her husband, John Volpe, had just
been elected governor and she needed an inaugural suit and gown.
The singer Connie Francis followed and then the socialite Frances
Fahnestock. ``She came every week. She became my patroness. From
her, I got anyone who was anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 21, Fiandaca was on Newbury Street, and his
designs were selling in Jordan Marsh's designer salon. Later he
would sell in Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Bergdorf
Goodman as well.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, the actor Michael Douglas called to request a gown for
actress Louise Fletcher to wear to the Academy Awards. Douglas had
co-produced ``One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest'' and Fletcher was
nominated for playing nurse Mildred Ratched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Fiandaca says. ``And then she
actually won!'' Fiandaca would later design clothes for Joan
Rivers, Joan Bennett Kennedy, Anita Baker, and Raquel Welch.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of client roster, Fiandaca would probably be a
household name today except for a disaster that hit in 1981. He
became involved in a palimony suit with a former partner. The
battle between the two men in court generated headlines, which
wasn't good for business. ``He was suing me for half my assets,''
Fiandaca says. ``It was devastating emotionally and financially.
The only way to get out of it was to stop working.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiandaca has since restructured his company, working with
business partner Caroline Collings, a Boston entrepreneur. He
opened his store in Palm Beach three years ago because so many of
his clients winter here. ``I felt it was a shoo-in,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the designer's hunch was right. His cozy salon with
upholstered walls, marble fireplace, and wooden ceiling (located
parallel to Worth Avenue on Via Mizner) is like the town hall.
Customers like Eve Holmes drop in all the time to gossip. ``Has
Jean been in? What did she get?'' Holmes asked on a recent
afternoon, referring to another client.
</P>
<P>
   Clients like Claude Rosinsky _ a former saleswoman in New York
for Hubert de Givenchy _ come in to admire his work. ``His dresses
are elegant and stunning. They're the kind of thing you want to
keep and pass on to your daughter-in-law,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   And shoppers like Joan and Randall Yearwood, of Franklin, Tenn.,
stop by because they consider Fiandaca more than a designer; he's a
friend. ``Alfred, did I hear you may not come to the Swan Ball (a
Nashville society event)? You'd better be there,'' said Randall
recently. ``I want you to come to the house for dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, in a town so caught up in style that even the
parking tickets are wrapped nicely in plastic, there are few other
designers taking up seasonal residence. For women like Cornacchia,
that means Fiandaca's custom-made clothes are one of the few
options in town. ``Start thinking Kentucky Derby, Alfred,'' she
said one recent Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Juggling three stores in three cities takes its toll. Fiandaca _
who does his sketching and design work late at night after his shop
here is closed _ says he sometimes wishes he could just be a
designer who ``sits in an ivory tower'' and creates. ``But then I
would lose human contact,'' he says. ``That's what gives me the
spark, the inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   And _ for better or worse _ the social invitations. ``Next week,
I have three parties so far,'' he says. ``But I think one more is
coming.''

ALBANIA'S YOUTHFUL LEADER EYES US AS KEY TO KOSOVO PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you are the youngest prime minister on the planet,
wide-eyed in the ways of wielding power, you tend to notice things.
</P>
<P>
   When Pandeli Majko, age 31, was chosen for the perilous task of
leading Albania four months ago, the first thing he noticed upon
entering the prime minister's office in his capital, Tirana, was
the bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of them,'' he grinned Saturday in an interview in
Boston. His country of 3.5 million Albanians, with the seething
Serb-run cauldron of Kosovo on its doorstep, is struggling to
restabilize after a chaotic emergence from a half-century of
communist dictatorship that kept that the hilly Balkan backwater
imprisoned in a preindustrial-age straitjacket.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off a giddy meet-everyone-who-counts stop in Washington _
where Petrit Bushati, Albanian ambassador to the United States,
scored face time for his new boss with President Clinton, the
Cabinet officers running State, Defense, Justice and Commerce,
various congresspersons, and Richard Holbrooke, the Clinton
administration's chief Balkan troubleshooter _ Majko (pronounced
May-co) heard Clinton single him out at the capital's annual Prayer
Breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I shook hands with him after the Prayer Breakfast,'' said
Majko over coffee at the Ritz. ``With him praying aloud for us, and
his interest in our problems in Kosovo, after that, I did not feel
(I was) the youngest prime minister in the world. He filled me with
optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeached president was on trial for his political life down
the street, where his enemies run the show, but the Albanian was
convinced he had the commander-in-chief's undivided attention.
``When I met with President Clinton, you cannot imagine how much
attention and how much concern he felt about the problems of our
region, and of Kosovo in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congress may have been derailed by the Impeachment Express,
but the US role of policing the planet is still ongoing, 24-7
despite whatever the domestic squabble, no matter how squalid. Our
NATO allies want up to 4,000 US ground troops in harms way to deter
Slobodan Milosevic, the odious Serb Slaughterer, whose depredations
have roiled the Balkans for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Majko picks his words carefully; he was trained as a mechanical
engineer at University of Tirana, and can converse in Italian,
German, and English as well as his native tongue, though his
French, he shrugged, is a tad rusty.
</P>
<P>
   America's role as superpower, its military might, as well as our
economic firepower, make the United States the one power base that
can make undeniable impact on all the other players, Majko
suggests. It was the threat of air strikes by US and British
aircraft that forced Milosevic to accept an emergency international
diplomatic powwow on Kosovo in Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   Majko thinks having US troops on the ground in Kosovo will be
crucial to separating the combatants. Why? ``American soldiers
proved so far to be the only ones who were not taken hostage in
Bosnia,'' he replied. Neither the Serbs nor the other factions in
the bloodied former Yugoslavia wanted to risk the kind of
retaliation the US Air Force can bring within hours of an outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my strong belief that without this very serious
involvement of the US administration, we will not have a
longstanding peace in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: If you guys don't do it, no one can.
</P>
<P>
   He is embracing the US free-market model, and in the place of a
torn-down monument to the late dictator Envir Hoxa, ``We will again
put a monument there _ to Mother Teresa,'' the Albanian girl who
became a nun.
</P>
<P>
   Did he get everything he wanted in D.C.? Not quite. He wanted to
pick up a toy for his child. And he wanted to meet a Kennedy; JFK
was his hero from boyhood. He raved about a friendly letter from
Ted Kennedy. ``I believe President Kennedy made a real revolution
in politics,'' said Majko, echoing something similar said by
Mikhail Gorbachev years ago of Kennedy's skill:
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a very important element _ communication.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability to communicate with one's political foes is what is
missing in the Balkans, said Majko, where the blood over ethnic
cleansing flows from a root cause that ``we have so much history''
in such a small space.
</P>
<P>
   With a prescience that is in short supply in Washington these
days, Majko stressed the need to communicate, ``talking to people,
particularly your opponents.'' Lean of frame and with streaks of
premature gray in his black hair, Majko laughed. We just had a
``friendly soccer match'' with the opposition in Tirana, he said.
Soccer balls instead of bullet holes in just four months, he
laughed. ``We won, by the way.''
</P>
<P>
   He also won in Washington, scoring diplomatic commitments, and a
$320 million contract between the Albanian telephone apparatus and
New World Telecom, which Majko hopes will lead to further
privatization of formerly state-held enterprises and a new wave of
Western investment.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings laid
groundwork for further investments, he said, and he is hopeful that
the advent of the euro will lift all the boats, in JFK's famous
phrase, even Albania's little put-put of an economy. ``The euro is
one of the good things, new, and very positive for the psychology
of Europe . . . the old Europe after two world wars does not exist
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``the American presence is indispensable in our region to
guarantee a peaceful settlement. Yes, there is the euro,'' and that
it connotes, ``but Europe still needs the American presence,''
which means the attention of whoever is president, for which Majko
is exceedingly grateful.

WAX CONNECTS CANDLES AND CARS AT THIS MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRIFFITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH DEERFIELD, Mass. _ OK, auto aficionados, Valentine's Day
is a week away, and I'm going to whisper two ``can't-miss'' words
in your ear.
</P>
<P>
   Ready?
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Candle.
</P>
<P>
   Did you get it?
</P>
<P>
   Good.
</P>
<P>
   Now to explain what links cars 'n' candles in Western Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, when young Mike Kittredge was following the
American Dream and building his Yankee Candle business, one of his
personal indulgences was a neat car or two.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 was a 1970 Jaguar, bought in 1972 with the first of his
hard-earned candlemaking profits. Fortunately (in retrospect), that
Jag cost him so much to repair that he sold it and used the
proceeds to resume his candlemaking business.
</P>
<P>
   But cars remained a key component of his operation.
</P>
<P>
   As Yankee Candle grew, many times Kittredge would be leaving the
building only to find a cluster of folks around his car, talking
about (no surprise) cars.
</P>
<P>
   These folks were the shopped-out companions of Yankee Candle
patrons. Mostly, but not always, they were males.
</P>
<P>
   They had come along for the shopping, but ran out of gas (so to
speak) before their companions were finished and stepped outside
only to find a special interest car.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yankee Candle, being a good corporate neighbor, also
started hosting an annual antique- and special-interest-car show to
benefit Mothers Against Drunk Driving. The shows were a huge hit,
bringing in big crowds and making some serious money for the
charity.
</P>
<P>
   But they also made a lot of money for Yankee Candle, too. On
auto show days, the daily receipts were up appreciably.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mr. Kittredge didn't build a company that was sold for a
reported $400 million last April by ingnoring details like this.
</P>
<P>
   So he opened a small auto museum across the street from the main
Yankee Candle operation on Route 5. He put some of his own cars on
display and also exhibited other folks' cars as well.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he expanded the main retail building to include a
separate museum (we told you this is a big place) capable of
displaying 85-90 cars. ``The kind of cars that make you go WOW!''
is how YC describes its ever-changing display. An example: A 1977
Volkswagen Beetle with 150 original miles that was bought from
Jerry Seinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cars belong to the museum, some belong to Kittredge,
and many are on loan from individuals. How do these latter cars
wind up in a museum?
</P>
<P>
   That's where museum employees such as historian John Schieffelin
come in.
</P>
<P>
   He's constantly overseeing the collection and schmoozing with
visitors, many of whom surprise him with their revelations of rare
or restored cars, trucks, and motorcycles in their possession and
in need of a safe place to be stored and displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Example: Ken Burian of Hampden, Mass., was visiting the museum
and mentioned to Schieffelin that he had a rebuilt 1948 Indian
Scout racing motorcycle sitting in his grandmother's cellar. The
two got talking, and now the motorcycle is on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people call to offer cars,'' said Schieffelin. ``Some
are just looking for winter storage, but our goal is to find cars
that fit in our displays.'' When the two goals agree, a vehicle
goes on display.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's exhibits fit various loose categories, generally
displayed in rows. There's a row of early 1900 steam, electric, and
gas vehicles; an oddball row, featuring the Seinfeld VW, a
Metropolitan, Isetta, Citroen, Amphicar, and Messerschmitt; a
tremendous collection of eight Ferraris scattered throughout the
room; a row of American Muscle cars; a row of NASCAR and other
American race cars; a row of European sports car racers and much
more.
</P>
<P>
   One current favorite is a 1912 Renault Brewster Landaulette. You
might not recognize the name, but one was in the hold of the
Titanic and now rests at the bottom of the North Atlantic. And a
similar one was used in the movie for a love scene with Leonardo
DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the ``Do not touch'' signs are out on 85 of the 87
cars on display.
</P>
<P>
   But not on two of the cars.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has a 1982 Ferrari 308 GTsi and a 1961 Rolls-Royce
Silver Cloud II on the floor as ``photo op'' cars. Visitors can
climb in and have their pictures taken _ as long as they remembered
a camera.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if they didn't, one-time-use cameras are for sale.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Mike Kittredge didn't build a company that was sold
for a reported $400 million last April by ignoring details like
this.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(Museum admission is $5 for adults, $2 for children under 11;
children under 4 are free.)

BELL ATLANTIC SAYS IT'S READY FOR THE COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's open season on Bell Atlantic Corp.
</P>
<P>
   For years after the Baby Bells were spun off from AT&AMP;T Corp. in
1984, Bell Atlantic lumbered along, wielding its monopoly power
over local phone service. A whiff of competition began after
passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which called for the
Bell companies to open their local markets to rivals. Now, New
York-based Bell Atlantic is under assault on seemingly all fronts _
ranging from local calling and long-distance service to wireless
communications and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts alone, Bell Atlantic faces 87 rivals. Four
years ago, Nynex Corp., the former New England phone company that
Bell Atlantic acquired in 1997, had just four competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real transition year for Bell Atlantic,'' said Fred
Voit, an analyst at The Yankee Group, the Boston market research
and consulting firm. ``They're losing business customers to
competitors, face some significant rivals for the first time in the
residential market and they need to get into long-distance
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's chief executive, 52-year-old Ivan G. Seidenberg,
who joined the company in New York out of high school and rose from
a cable splicer's assistant, maintains that the nation's largest
regional phone carrier is prepared for the competitive assault
arising from regulatory and technological changes sweeping the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing the telecommunications industry transition
itself away from large regional players to a handful of stronger
global players and we want to be one of them,'' said Seidenberg, in
a recent interview with The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the company is taking significant steps to transform
itself beyond a humdrum provider of local phone service in 13 East
Coast states. Its immediate goal is to expand into long-distance
service, initially in New York State. Like other Baby Bells, it is
barred by the 1996 telcomm act from entering the long-distance
market until it proves to regulators it has opened up its local
market. Meanwhile, Bell Atlantic also faces hurdles in gaining
regulatory approval for its $52.9 billion proposed acquisition of
GTE Corp., which would help give it a nationwide presence in local,
long-distance and wireless communications plus a wholesale Internet
business.
</P>
<P>
   Still, rivals are closing in from many directions. Long-distance
providers, most notably AT&AMP;T plus a horde of smaller competitors,
are pressing to get into local calling. Cable television service
providers, which have started to offer phone service over cable
wires, represent a huge new threat to the Baby Bells. Increasing
numbers of wireless carriers, both national and regional, are going
after Bell Atlantic's customers. A new breed of independent
carriers are offering high-speed Internet access. Just last week,
several competitors announced initiatives that turned up the heat
on Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Bell Atlantic's customers have more choices than ever
before, which promises to bring lower prices and improved service.
With all-out competition materializing in 1999, Bell Atlantic finds
itself slugging it out on numerous battlefields: &QL; 
 &QL; 
Local calling &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starting April 20, some residential Bell Atlantic customers in
Massachusetts will begin to see competition for toll calls. Callers
who dial 1+ any of the four Greater Boston area codes (617, 508,
978 and 781) will be able to choose an alternative _ such as AT&AMP;T
and MCI worldCom _ the way they pick a long-distance provider now.
</P>
<P>
   In some Boston suburbs, Bell Atlantic already faces another
competitor: MediaOne Group, the state's largest cable TV service
provider, whose coaxial cables can provide digital local phone
service. Aimed at consumers who make many local calls, MediaOne
offers a flat-rate service in 27 Mass. communities for $26.95 per
month.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week MediaOne obtained Time Warner's Bay State cable
system in a swap that will give MediaOne over one million customers
_ 59 percent of the state's cable TV market _ who are all potential
local telephone customers.
</P>
<P>
   MediaOne is not alone. Also last week, AT&AMP;T, in a bold effort to
challenge the Baby Bells in providing local residential phone
service, cut a deal to offer phone service over Time Warner's cable
lines in much of the country. That venture came on top of ATT's
pending purchase of Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's number
two cable television provider. AT&AMP;T already provides large
businesses in New York and Boston with local telephone service
through its subsidiary, Teleport Communications Group.
</P>
<P>
   Other Bell companies are looking to lock horns with Bell
Atlantic on local service. SBC Communications, San Antonio-based
Bell company, said last week it plans to enter the Boston market
late this year or early next, initially for business customers. It
would mark the first time a Baby Bell is attacking the turf of
another Bell company for local or long-distance services.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another assault on Bell Atlantic's local calling market,
MCI WorldCom last week began offering residential service in New
York State, at a 5 percent discount to Bell Atlantic rates or in
flat-rate monthly packages. MCI WorldCom, the nation's
second-largest long distance company, is leasing lines from Bell
Atlantic. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Long distance &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With long distance considered the brass ring for nearly all
regional Bell companies, Bell Atlantic's primary objective this
year is to offer long-distance service in New York State _ the
single largest source in the United States for domestic and
international calls.
</P>
<P>
   But it faces tough hurdles in proving to federal and state
regulators that it can meet the telcomm act's requirement of
freeing up local markets before being allowed to enter long
distance. Bell Atlantic expects to complete federal and state
requirements by the end of this month and clear all hurdles by the
summer or early fall, according to Seidenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Already several other regional Bells, such as Ameritech, have
tried and failed to gain regulatory approval to offer long-distance
service. But many analysts maintain Bell Atlantic could become the
first long-distance Bell company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a rosy expectation of how it will all come out,''
said Seidenberg.
</P>
<P>
   He bristles at the more than 600 pages of requirements needed to
prove that Bell Atlantic has the technology to switch customers who
may want an alternative local phone carrier. ``In the last few
years, we have not been permitted to have the kind of growth
strategies that our competitors have because of government
policies,'' he added, calling the requirements an ``anachronism.''
</P>
<P>
   After New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania are the next
states where Bell Atlantic plans to offer long distance. The
company says it plans to apply in both states by year-end. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wireless &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Bell Atlantic's overall revenue last year grew only 3
percent to $31.6 billion, its wireless business soared 25 percent.
That success came despite competition from five other wireless
competitors in greater Boston alone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bell Atlantic saw customer erosion as AT&AMP;T and Sprint PCS
offered single-rate calling plans to business and residential
customers that eliminated separate long-distance and roaming
charges. Bell Atlantic responded with a similar plan last year.
</P>
<P>
   And while the pending merger with GTE will significantly expand
its wireless operations to as far as California, Bell Atlantic was
unsuccessful in its bid to acquire AirTouch Communications Corp.,
the nation's largest independent cellular telephone company. Bell
Atlantic was outbid by Vodaphone Group PLC of England.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of GTE and AirTouch would have given Bell
Atlantic wireless coverage in 44 states and enabled it to better
compete against AT&AMP;T Wireless and Sprint PCS, which have
coast-to-coast networks.

   Seidenberg said the loss of AirTouch was a ``missed opportunity,
but not a critical loss,'' adding that the the Bell Atlantic-GTE
combination creates a large coast-to-coast wireless company
nonetheless. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Internet access &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Bell Atlantic plans to begin competing against
MediaOne, RCN Corp. and other area cable TV service providers with
Infospeed, a high-speed Internet service that uses the ubiquitous
telephone wire. The new service, which will cost up to $99.95 per
month compared to $50 per month or less for cable modem service, is
expected to appeal to residential customers in Boston and
communities not served by MediaOne or RCN.
</P>
<P>
   Some small- and medium-sized businesses are turning to other
companies that offer the same high-speed Internet service over
phone lines. These Internet service providers, such as Northpoint
Communications Inc., say they can undercut Bell Atlantic's prices
for high-speed telephone lines leased by businesses for Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts believe cable companies, compared with the
Baby Bells, have the upper hand in assembling a bundle of services
that include Internet access, TV and local dialing.
</P>
<P>
   But don't count the Baby Bells out.
</P>
<P>
   William P. Bane, a telecommunications analyst at Mercer
Management Consulting, said Bell Atlantic is better positioned than
the other Bells for the competitive new era. ``For Bell Atlantic
this is the Olympics, where the best of the best are in the
stadium,'' Bane said.

IMMUNOGEN SAVED BY $45 MILLION INFUSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With just over $2 million in cash and no chance of
commercializing a promising drug, ImmunoGen Inc. was facing a bleak
future.
</P>
<P>
   But in an 11th-hour rescue, SmithKline Beecham PLC, the large
British and American pharmaceutical company, agreed last week to
spend up to $45 million to develop and commercialize ImmunoGen's
proposed cancer-fighting drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were living hand-to-mouth for the past four years, and at
one point we were down to just enough cash to meet two bimonthly
payrolls,'' recalled Mitchel Sayare, chairman and chief executive
of the 18-year-old Norwood, Mass. biotechnology company. ``Now we
can at least focus on science instead of fund-raising, and morale
is up.''
</P>
<P>
   ImmunoGen, whose research pedigree is from Boston's Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute, was among the first generation of Boston-area
biotech firms. At one point it employed 180 people and had
extensive Massachusetts manufacturing facilities in Canton and
Norwood, plus laboratories in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   But it also hit hard times before many others, when its
first-generation cancer drug, a monoclonal antibody, proved
disappointing during extensive clinical trials. Without its lead
drug, the company downsized, laying off more than 100 people and
shutting down most of its manufacturing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, ImmunoGen's auditor, PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP
said it had substantial doubts that the company would be able to
continue, citing significant losses and the need for additional
financing. The company said it had enough cash on hand to last
until February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of its leading drug candidate, ImmunoGen stock
plummeted from a high of 24 in January 1992 to a recent low of 1
1/16, only to climb back to about 3 after last week after the
SmithKline deal was announced. ImmunoGen shares closed Tuesday at 2
3/4, down 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   And while its other research area looks to find potential
cancer-fighting drug candidates under a partnership with BioChem
Pharma Inc., a Canadian pharmaceutical company, ImmunoGen's major
cancer research had to be cut back for lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Sayare maintains the new drug is designed to treat colorectal
cancer, pancreatic cancer, and certain forms of lung cancer. It
works by using toxins, drugs coupled with monoclonal antibodies,
that promise to destroy cancerous cells in tumors without adversely
affecting nearby healthy cells.
</P>
<P>
   ImmunoGen has completed extensive testing of its newest drug in
mice and monkeys, said Sayare. Those trials showed such promising
results that SmithKline agreed to fund human testing. Sayare said
he hopes to begin a phase 1 safety trial this fall. ``We never lost
hope,'' said Sayare.

KISS COLLECTION MAKES A BIG IMPRESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes a kiss is just a kiss, sweeter than wine but just
something to build a dream on. Or something to put in your pocket
and take home like a souvenir ballpoint pen.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Schaible, a 36-year-old eligible bachelor, has been
collecting kisses for the last 16 years. ``I must have, oh, about
1,500, maybe more,'' said the traveling automation technician from
Kirkland, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Some technician, huh? Like, how or why does a guy go about
collecting kisses, say, like butterflies or stamps? ``Well, I do a
lot of traveling in my work, and I began collecting what are really
just `lip prints' so I would have something to show where I was,
and when,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Here we are, on the brink of Valentine's Day, remembering first
kisses _ Scott says his first real kiss was when he was ``about
15'' _ and hoping for others, when along comes a guy who collects
them with all the apparent detached passivity of a postage stamp
collector. (I would use that numiswhatever word, but it always
makes me stumble.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one was a lady here in Seattle. We were just friends
going out, and she had dabbed her lips with a napkin before eating,
and I saw her lip print on the napkin and said: `Hey, would you
sign that and put today's date on it?''' Schaible recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Well, this frequent flier became a frequent trier of lines like
that throughout the United States, Mexico, Canada, South America
and Australia _ everywhere his work took him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, a lot of women think it's weird ... but they still
do it. I figure only 5 percent, probably even less, won't.''
</P>
<P>
   So, let's get this straight. A reasonably good-looking guy from
Seattle is spending the week on a job assignment in, say, Brazil,
and he showers after a long day's work and goes down to the hotel
lounge and orders a pre-dinner drink and notices across the room a
strikingly beautiful woman twirling an ice cube around in a tall
frosted glass.
</P>
<P>
   Right off the travel brochure. She has long, glossy black hair
that falls like silk over her sandlewood shoulders, and her dark
eyes move slowly in the back bar mirror, taking in everything and
everyone and finally stopping as she meets his reflected gaze.
There is just a moment of lock-on as her radar paints his target
... or is it the other way around?
</P>
<P>
   And then he takes his glass, stands up and slowly approaches her
at the bar. He smiles softly, nods, never taking his eyes off hers,
and he puts his drink down, extends his hand. She notices he is
handing her a ballpoint pen like the ones in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me,'' he says, ``but my name is Scott Schaible and I'm
from the United States ... from a place you probably never even
heard of, called Kirkland, actually Juanita, in Washington state,
and I couldn't help noticing your exquisite lipstick color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to have an extensive lip-print collection and was
wondering if you wouldn't mind simply making a lipstick impression
on your drink napkin there and signing it ... just your first name,
and put the date on it, too, if you would. I sure would appreciate
it.''
</P>
<P>
   I was getting all warmed up about this scenario when Scott
assured me that it wasn't like that most of the time. He doesn't
date these women, doesn't even try most of the time. ``That's not
the intention. I just want to have something to remind me of where
I've been,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lip-print trolling is particularly good in Seattle on, say,
Halloween, when women are doing their Vampira numbers. ``Sometimes
I might get into Seattle on Halloween and be partying at the J&AMP;M
(Cafe) and one year I got 113 in one night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, obviously at least one of those black, purple and other
exotic lip impressions should remind him of where he was and what
he was doing on Halloween of a given year.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said he's never met anyone else who collected lip prints,
but that he doesn't consider it particularly odd. ``I don't have
them displayed like trophies or anything like that,'' he said. ``I
do have some albums with some (lip prints), but all of the rest are
in boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, they think I'm joking, or that it's sorta weird,
but they usually do it. I just explain what I'm doing. And I have
bought some drinks,'' he said, to help convince the lipstick wearer
that he's not some subterranean scuzzbag trolling for victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never any pressure. If a lady is sitting with her
boyfriend, usually the boyfriend encourages her to do it. And then
they both think it's sorta funny.''
</P>
<P>
   These lip-printers are not all fabulously beautiful. Neither are
they all complete strangers. ``I have prints from my mother, and
many of my former girlfriends,'' Scott noted. ``And on the
girlfriends, usually I got their prints before we got involved.''
</P>
<P>
   And they don't ask for their lip prints back when they split up,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   There's a country-western song title somewhere in all this
lip-smacking stuff, but I'd better kiss it off.

PROMISE UNFULFILLED AT ALPHA-BETA

<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. _ The year was 1992, and while the rest of the
nation was starting to shake off a devastating recession,
Massachusetts was still in the dumps. Unemployment was 8 percent
and layoffs in the computer industry were almost daily events.
</P>
<P>
   The only Bay State companies showing hope were those in health
care and biotechnology _ and other states were actively wooing the
biotech companies with lower costs and tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   And then Alpha-Beta Technology Inc., a biotechnology start-up
that had been nurtured for five years by a public-private
partnership that provided investment capital and low rent in
Worcester's state-backed biotech park, made its move . . . to Rhode
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha-Beta wanted to build a factory, and couldn't get the
financing it needed in Massachusetts. The Rhode Island Port
Authority and Economic Development Corp. offered an incentive
package that included $30 million in state-backed bonds and a site
in an industrial park in North Smithfield. The plant was expected
to eventually employ 200 people or more.
</P>
<P>
   The company's move set off a political firestorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more Alpha-Betas!'' Governor William F. Weld shouted, as he
successfully pushed for legislative approval of tax credits and
other retaliatory weapons in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The company didn't intend to be a poster child, says Spiros
Jamas, its cofounder and chief executive. ``We were trying to make
the right decisions for the company. At the time, it was a win-win
situation for Alpha-Beta and for Rhode Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Time, however, has dealt a far different outcome than anyone
envisioned, and one that underscores the overconfidence both state
economic development officials and investors once placed in
biotechnology as an industry with unlimited promise.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, after 11 years and nearly $200 million in spending,
Alpha-Beta, with its headquarters still in Worcester, announced it
was going out of business.
</P>
<P>
   A series of costly tests on human patients failed to show that
its infection-fighting drug, Betafectin, worked.
</P>
<P>
   Along with 85 layoffs, Alpha-Beta defaulted on its loan, leaving
Rhode Island with a building and equipment that a Port Authority
spokeswoman said will be difficult to sell and is unlikely to fetch
the $26.8 million still owed. Others at the Port Authority didn't
return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha-Beta's abrupt end is just one in a recent series of
failures among small biotechnology companies whose products didn't
work or that ran out of money. Some were sold to bigger
pharmaceutical companies; some simply disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge NeuroScience Inc. of Cambridge, EcoScience Corp. of
Worcester, Institute of Molecular Biology Inc. of Worcester, and
Seragen Inc. of Hopkinton _ the latter backed heavily by Boston
University _ all are gone. On Monday, ImmuLogic Pharmaceutical
Corp. of Waltham joined the list, announcing the sale of its assets
following setbacks in its development of drugs to combat allergies
and treat multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Far from delivering on its early promise of effective cures for
exotic diseases, biotechnology has instead proved to be a complex
endeavor, with high costs and long lead times requiring the
financial stamina only big corporations can usually deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, faced with uncertainties about when they would get
their money back, have accordingly steered away, often just as many
firms needed fresh money the most, to pay for clinical trials that
determine whether their products do work.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, Massachusetts boasts several successes,
including Biogen Inc., Genzyme Corp., and Genetics Institute Inc.,
all of Cambridge. And Peter Feinstein, whose Cambridge public
relations consulting firm had Alpha-Beta among its clients, says:
``There are few bankruptcies in the biotechnology industry.'' But
delays hurt a company's credibility and worry investors. Without
investment, ``they can't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pops, president of the Massachusetts Biotechnology
Council and chief executive of Alkermes of Cambridge, adds: ``The
risks (for investors) are high; the lead times are long; and there
are alternatives for them.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those alternatives is a new breed of companies that is
abandoning the painstaking and often spotty laboratory approach to
research in favor of using higher mathematics to draw a genetic map
_ the human genome _ to better target that research.
</P>
<P>
   In his cluttered office at the Massachusetts Biotechnology
Research Park in Worcester, Jamas, 38, who founded Alpha-Beta in
1987 while at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, talked
last week about his company's bitter end.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by half-filled boxes, the slightly-built,
black-haired son of Greek parents, born in Zambia and educated in
Athens and in England before enrolling at MIT, said last year was
especially hectic as Alpha-Beta set out on a last-ditch effort to
prove Betafectin would be a useful drug.
</P>
<P>
   Developed to stop staphylcoccus and other infections common to
hospital patients after abdominal surgery, Betafectin failed to
deliver clear-cut results in a first clinical test concluded in
1987. But that test also hinted that it might work in cases
involving only the upper gastro-intestinal tract. Alpha-Beta
commissioned a second clinical trial, involving 612 patients at
more than 30 hospitals _ half of whom would get a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   The new test could cost more than $5 million and would take
until the end of 1999 to complete. But by mid-1998 it was clear
Alpha-Beta would run out of money in early 1999. Through September
1998, the company had spent $157 million, most of it raised in
public stock offerings. Those shares, once worth $30.50 each, by
last fall were trading at less than $2.
</P>
<P>
   By November, Jamas and his chief financial officer, Joseph M.
Grimm, had arranged to raise $3 million more from a New York
investment group. Alpha-Beta got $1.5 million right away. The rest
would be paid only if an interim report on the trials, due Jan. 21,
was rosy. Investors would then get up to 30 percent control of the
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jamas, ``We were running against the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   One evening in mid-January, Grimm went shopping and the next
morning entered Jamas' office with a small burgundy-colored placard
reading, ``Ask me about January 21st.'' It came from a store
counter and referred to an upcoming sale. Jamas put it on his desk.
``It was just a coincidence,'' he said, and amid the tension it
brought laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Then, late on Jan. 21, in a light rain, Jamas and others drove
to Boston, to the offices of Goodwin Proctor &AMP; Hoar, the company's
lawyers. There, closeted in a conference room, three scientists
chosen jointly by Alpha-Beta and the US Food and Drug
Administration _ and whose names are kept secret from others _ were
reviewing the preliminary data.
</P>
<P>
   Around 8 p.m. the scientists emerged and told the Alpha-Beta
team they saw no indication Betafectin worked much better than the
placebo, even in this select group of patients. ``They told us they
did not think the study should continue,'' Jamas said.
</P>
<P>
   About that finding Jamas will say only: ``The facts are what
they are. . . we are still trying to accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning the company announced the news and that in
addition to 60 people laid off last September, 85 more in Rhode
Island and Worcester would also go. Only seven in a Denver
subsidiary with federal funding for its antifungal product research
were spared.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, on Jan. 28, with its shares worth only pennies,
Alpha-Beta announced it had entered into a legal assignment for the
benefit of creditors and arranged to liquidate its assets,
including patents and technology for producing Betafectin's core
ingredient. Jamas believes beta glucans will eventually find a use
_ perhaps by veterinarians; perhaps as a food thickener. ``We feel
after 11 years there is a lot of value here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong? For one thing, Jamas said, initial animal
studies and trials on small numbers of humans may have been too
limited to yield accurate results. But, he said, ``In the heat of
the moment . . . we made a conscious decision to go forward with
the Phase 3 tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamas, who has been in school or running Alpha-Beta all his
adult life, has no idea what he will do next. He sees himself in an
entrepreneurial role, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has probably been the best business school I could go
to,'' he said of his experience.
</P>
<P>
   Others don't see biotechnology's future as sanguinely. Janice
Bourque of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council, an industry
organization, agrees with Feinstein that this is work left to big
companies with big bankrolls.
</P>
<P>
   And in Worcester, the Massachusetts Biotechnology Research
Initiative, formed with state and federal support in 1989 to
attract biotech companies to the research park here, changed its
name last year to Massachusetts Biomedical Initiatives and shifted
its focus to recruitment of medical devices companies _ a sector
with a far better success and employment record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biotechnology has proved to be a very risky investment,'' says
Mark Roosevelt, the Democrat who opposed Weld in the 1994
gubernatorial election and who is now the organization's top
officer. Furthermore, he said, ``the jobs biotech has produced just
aren't as many as people hoped. . . In terms of job growth, medical
devices is a better place to be.''

ASSISTED-LIVING FIRMS TAKING A BEATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new year was barely a month old and the stocks of
assisted-living companies were already taking a beating. Then the
market went from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Carematrix Corp. came under more pressure when an
influential stock analyst sounded a warning Feb. 4 over a wild card
in Washington: a government report on the assisted-living industry
that has been in the works for two years and is likely to be made
public in April. No one knows what it will say.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Sheryl Skolnick of BancBoston Robertson Stephens pulled
her recommendations on a handful of companies, worried about the
unknown conclusions of the General Accounting Office report and the
wet blanket it will likely throw over the stocks for months to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives cried foul. Other analysts downplayed the
impact of the pending GAO report, being prepared for the Senate's
Special Committee on Aging. Skolnick dug in and aggressively
defended her actions.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine a business better positioned to capitalize
on the graying of America than assisted-living companies, which
build and manage residences offering varying degrees of care to
seniors. They are also a prime example of a group of young, small
stocks that were whipsawed by events and fears mostly beyond their
control.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies were already fighting stock slides before the
GAO report became an issue. Some were hurt by a roiling market for
securities backed by commercial mortgages, a source of financing.
Others were affected by confusion over so-called ``black box''
arrangements that help finance the construction of some residences
using development partners. Those deals are expensive but keep
projects off the balance sheets of assisted-living companies.
Critics complained the arrangements mask financial risks and make
it hard to evaluate the health of individual companies.
</P>
<P>
   An important industry merger, the $484 million purchase of
Assisted Living Concepts Inc. by American Retirement Corp.,
collapsed on Feb. 1. The leading issue: a restatement of earnings
based on the accounting of reimbursements from a development
partner.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report, requested in 1997, is based on survey
information in four states. Most observers believe it is highly
unlikely to prompt new regulation of assisted-living companies.
Medicare doesn't pay for assisted living so the government has
almost no ability to institute pricing regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Skolnick's report pulled her recommendations for four stocks.
She had rated Carematrix a ``strong buy'' and the largest public
assisted-living company, Sunrise Assisted Living Inc., a ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she took the action this month because, in her
experience covering health care stocks, such government reports
become market influences once a date is set to make them public.
(Committee officials said Tuesday they hoped to release the report
in April, but no firm date had been set.)
</P>
<P>
   Skolnick warned investors that the GAO report might not lead to
regulation but could still have something to say about prices as a
consumer-protection issue: Do people really get what they pay for
and are they being pitched things they don't need?
</P>
<P>
   It might not have sharp teeth, but the report could be bad
publicity that hurts business. It could be even worse for investor
psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when you have great companies whose stocks
can't get ahead to save their lives,'' she said Tuesday. ``You can
have spectacular earnings reports and it won't matter one iota.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report ``could eventually have no impact on these
businesses, but it will likely have an impact on their stock prices
over the next six months,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Carematrix shares, already beaten down to 24 by Feb. 4, have
fallen to 16 15/16 in the week since. Sunrise lost slightly less
than 10 percent of its value. Some other assisted-living stocks
suffered no impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies lost hundreds of millions of dollars (in stock
market value) on a very speculative report and we think it's an
injustice,'' said Karen Wayne, president of the Assisted Living
Federation of America, which has worked with the GAO on its report.
</P>
<P>
   The industry line on the GAO report is that it will recommend
only that services and expenses are clearly disclosed to clients by
all assisted-living companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a nonissue to us,'' said Robert Kaufman, chief
executive of Carematrix. ``This is just a disclosure issue; it's
not an industry regulation issue. You're talking about something
that's been going on for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony: Skolnick's report really didn't say anything that was
very different. It might have sounded a bit more alarmist and
focused on psychological stock market impact. But it didn't predict
any dire concrete change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this industry is going away and I don't think it
will be regulated heavily by the federal government anytime in the
near future,'' she said Tuesday. ``If investors have patience these
are fundamentally sound companies.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Brandeis University professor Stuart Altman is one popular
guy.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Thier, who runs the growing Massachusetts General and
Brigham &AMP; Women's hospitals, has called, as has Mitch Rabkin, the
former boss at the struggling Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.
He has heard from the chiefs of nearly every other hospital in
town, too.
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old Altman, who has spent a lifetime working in
health care, has known these people for years, but they are not
calling to chitchat. Instead, they are worried _ worried about a
train that is coming down the tracks that could profoundly affect
the future of their institutions and Boston's entire world-class
medical complex.
</P>
<P>
   That train is Medicare reform. And Altman is very much a man on
the spot right now.
</P>
<P>
   From his relatively obscure seat as the Sol C. Chaikin Professor
of National Health Policy at Brandeis, Altman has emerged as one of
two critical swing votes on a presidential commission that is
nearing the end of an increasingly contentious deliberation on what
to do about Medicare, the government program that controls $1 in
every $5 spent on health care in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare story has been pushed off the media's radar by the
Bill &AMP; Monica Show. But the Medicare commission _ now getting Page
22 treatment in the papers _ is debating radical changes in the
basic health care plan for the elderly and disabled that could
affect virtually every baby boomer and the institutions that
provide their care.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the debate: Will Medicare remain a form of social
insurance, with wide responsibility for helping the nation keep
teaching hospitals and hospitals for the poor up and running? Or
will it become a basic, low-cost provider of care, with the rewards
going to whomever can provide care at the lowest price?
</P>
<P>
   All of the giant building blocks of the $200 billion Medicare
program are in play.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John B. Breaux (D-La.), the commission's chairman, is
pushing a ``premium support'' system (read: vouchers) in which the
government would give people money to pay the premium for whatever
health care insurer they want. There is debate on raising the
eligibility age and including prescription drug coverage. And, most
worrisome to teaching hospitals like Mass. General and inner-city
facilities like Boston Medical Center are attempts to end the
Medicare payments that compensate them for teaching and caring for
the poor, and replace them instead with a separate appropriation
Congress would consider each year.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Congress is going to have much to say on these issues.
But the Breaux commission, like the Social Security panels before
it, will go far in shaping the debate. Are the vote there for a
radical remaking of Medicare into a more market-oriented system?
</P>
<P>
   That's where Altman becomes so critical.
</P>
<P>
   All recommendations need 11 votes of the commission's 17
members. The eight Republicans have been in lockstep since Day One.
Breaux and Senator Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) are also on board. That
makes 10 votes.
</P>
<P>
   The swing votes are both Clinton appointees, Laura D. Tyson, the
president's former chief economic adviser, and Altman.
</P>
<P>
   Altman, an economist who worked on health care in both the Nixon
and Clinton administrations, is clear that he could well vote for
moving to a more market-driven system. ``I don't think people are
inherently evil if they make a profit,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But he is just as clear on the price of his vote: Medicare
coverage for prescription drugs, a ``reasonably high'' level of
premium supports, and assurances the needy will not get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   As for the teaching hospitals, Altman said they would lose a
straight up-or-down vote on the commission today. He doesn't want
to see that vote happen; he thinks it is unfair to pick on the
subsidy to the hospitals if the commission isn't willing to put all
subsidies on the table.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help but wonder: Aren't you protecting your hometown
hospitals? Altman's answer: ``So?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a prominent conservative and presidential
adviser, Harvard economist Martin Feldstein has long antagonized
liberals with his views on taxes and social programs. Now, the man
known as ``Dr. Gloom'' has whipped up something so seductive, so
politically intoxicating _ something, his critics fear, that is so
downright diabolical _ that labor unions and left-wing policy
groups have sounded a red alert.
</P>
<P>
   Feldstein has a plan to fix Social Security. Congress is
considering a half-dozen ideas for shoring up the program's weak
finances, but this one makes a nearly irresistible claim: Feldstein
says he can save the program from insolvency without raising taxes
_ all while boosting the payments that retirees receive each month.
</P>
<P>
   So what do the critics say?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Feldstein plan is likely to lead to the unraveling of the
current Social Security system,'' claims Alicia Munnell of Boston
College, a former economic adviser to President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a seductive headline, but it doesn't stand up to
scrutiny very well,'' says David Smith, policy chief for the
AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears as a free lunch. . . But of course there is no free
lunch,'' says Robert Greenstein of the Center for Budget and Policy
Priorities, which advocates on behalf of low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Martin Feldstein to kick up some dust. For more than
a quarter-century, the 59-year-old economist has put himself at the
center of some of the most important policy battles in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as 1974, Feldstein wrote an influential paper on
Social Security that is still fodder for academic debates. As
President Reagan's chief economist in the early 1980s, his warnings
on the dangers of the federal budget deficit earned him the
nickname ``Dr. Gloom'' and led to public fights with other White
House aides. The spectacled, mild-looking economist landed in such
unusual venues as People magazine and ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Feldstein has again become a force in Washington. He is the
most prominent of several Boston economists who play leading roles
in the high-stakes debate over how to repair Social Security, the
nation's most popular and expensive domestic program.
</P>
<P>
   Munnell, director of the new Center for Retirement Research at
Boston College, has become a leading opponent of the most radical
proposals to alter Social Security. Peter Diamond of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology led a prominent panel of
economists in studying Social Security reforms at the National
Academy of Social Insurance. At Boston College, Laurence Kotlikoff
is known for studies on how Social Security, and fiscal policy in
general, affects the broader economy. Boston College's Joseph Quinn
writes about factors that affect the decision to retire.
</P>
<P>
   But more than any academic, Feldstein has made the leap from
economic abstraction to the political realities of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has affected peoples' thinking and the nature of the debate
probably more than any other academic or think-tank participant,''
says economist Robert Reischauer of the Brookings Institution, who
nonetheless opposes Feldstein's prescription for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   At one point last fall, White House aides were intrigued enough
by Feldstein's plan that the AFL-CIO, Jesse Jackson, and a coterie
of liberal and seniors groups mounted a furious campaign to warn
the president away. ``This plan is still alive,'' says Smith of the
AFL-CIO. ``There is still a lot of interest on Capitol Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, a Republican and former economics
professor, studied Feldstein's ideas in detail before writing
legislation that looked remarkably similar. Though he later backed
another proposal, Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire,
clipped a copy of Feldstein's plan from The Wall Street Journal and
sent a copy to all of his Senate colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has drawn such interest _ and heat _ because it claims
there is a pain-free way to do the one thing liberals fear the
most: privatize Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Privatization is the idea that workers should invest their
Social Security taxes for themselves. Those taxes are high: Workers
pay 6.2 percent of their wages, and employers pay an additional 6.2
percent. Yet, it is not enough. Social Security will likely run
short of money early in the next century, as the wave of baby
boomers begins to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of privatization say that if workers could pay some
of that tax money into their own stock and bond accounts, they
would grow a big nest egg for retirement. As it is now, they say,
Social Security offers too little in benefits for all those tax
payments. And benefits might drop lower, once the system is forced
to support millions of baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   But many people believe that private accounts violate the spirit
of the national retirement program. To them, Social Security is not
an investment plan but an insurance policy against poverty in old
age. Everyone pays in, and everyone is guaranteed a pension.
High-earners subsidize pensions for low-wage workers, helping
assure them a decent retirement.

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 WASHINGTON: ... decent retirement.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stock picking, on the other hand, produces winners and losers _
and the losers might fall into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, say opponents of private accounts, Social Security is
already sure to run short of money in a few decades. Allowing
workers to divert tax money into their own accounts would only make
the problem worse, forcing benefit cuts for people who are already
retired or who will retire in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Feldstein's trick is to plant a foot in both camps.
</P>
<P>
   He would keep Social Security intact, but create a private
account for every worker. Under the plan he wrote with Andrew
Samwick, every year the government would deposit money into each
private account equal to 2 percent of the worker's wages. The money
would come from the huge budget surpluses that both Congress and
the White House foresee for the next decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   When the worker retired, money in the account would be used to
buy an annuity, a financial vehicle that gives a fixed payment
annually until death.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike many other private account plans, the worker would
keep only one-quarter of the annuity payments. The rest would go
back to the Social Security system to shore up its weakened
finances. At the same time, the worker would receive every penny of
Social Security benefits that is promised today.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the worker would get all benefits offered by the
current system, plus one-quarter of what he or she accumulated
through years of stock picking for the private account.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mixed system,'' Feldstein said recently at his office
in Cambridge, Mass. ``It's not privatized in the sense that we say
`Good luck, fella. Hope you have a nice retirement.' This is very
much a government-organized system, and it guarantees that the
benefits will be at least as much as you would have gotten from
Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   The obvious question is how the government can afford to do it
all _ continue the underfunded Social Security program that exists
today while putting an extra 2 percent of wages to each private
account.
</P>
<P>
   Feldstein's answer: Use the budget surplus for as long as
possible. Then, he acknowledges, the government might have to raise
taxes for a few years. But by 2030, he says, the system would be
self-financing. All those individual accounts would have
accumulated trillions of dollars _ money that would find its way to
businesses through stock and bond sales. Businesses would use the
money to expand and become more productive. Profits would rise,
producing more corporate tax revenue for the government.
</P>
<P>
   And the government would use that money to finance its hybrid
Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   One notable feature of Feldstein's plan is its political savvy.
By claiming that the current system will survive, Feldstein
challenges the idea that private accounts divert tax money away
from today's retirees. And by saying workers keep all their current
benefits even if stock prices fall, he makes it safe for
politicians to embrace the risk of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people make a bad stock decision, Marty's plan seems to
say, `Don't worry, you won't do worse than under the current
system,' '' Munnell says. ``Now, I view that as extremely clever.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty is not an ivory tower academic who thinks up grand
schemes with no relation to the political system,'' Greenstein
says. ``I think he knows exactly what he is doing politically.''
</P>
<P>
   The fear that these and other analysts have is that Feldstein's
true goal is to eliminate Social Security and to move to a totally
private system. They also say that Feldstein is overstating the
corporate tax revenues that his plan would produce. As a result,
his plan would create a huge budget squeeze in a few decades,
forcing the government to cut vital social programs in order to
keep its commitments to both Social Security and the new system of
private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Even some lawmakers who strongly favor private accounts have
backed away from the Feldstein plan for fear that it would bust the
budget some time in the future.
</P>
<P>
   It is an ironic charge for Feldstein, who is best known as a
deficit-fighter. Nearly two decades ago, President Reagan told the
nation that it could afford to cut taxes while spending more on
defense. Introducing the term ``supply-side economics'' to the
nation, Reagan's aides argued that tax cuts would spur people to
invest and businesses to expand, which in turn would boost tax
receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Feldstein was well known as a conservative thinker. He was an
advocate of cutting capital gains taxes, and he had earned plenty
of enemies for arguing that Social Security should save money by
limiting annual cost-of-living raises. When Reagan appointed
Feldstein to be chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in
1982, even some Republicans who voted for him felt the need to
repudiate his views.
</P>
<P>
   But Feldstein publicly contradicted many of Reagan's economic
ideas. He feuded with the ``supply-side extremists'' who said a
large tax cut would pay for itself. He argued that high budget
deficits hurt the economy. At one point he and then-Treasury
Secretary Donald Regan gave opposite views of the deficit in
speeches on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the White House tried to muzzle and belittle
Feldstein. In one noted example, Reagan spokesman Larry Speakes
appeared to demean him by intentionally mispronouncing his name.
</P>
<P>
   After two outspoken years at the White House, Feldstein returned
to life in Cambridge. He informally advised President Bush in the
1992 presidential campaign. His newspaper column, co-written with
his wife, Kathleen, also an economist, appears in The Boston Globe
and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   A Harvard University professor since 1967, Feldstein also serves
as president of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a major
force in research funding. The post gives him unusual influence in
his profession, and he has held it for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Even Feldstein's political opponents say his time in Washington
combined with his mastery of economics make him a formidable figure
as Congress grapples with Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Says Greenstein: ``Lots of us who work on policy wish we could
find things that intoxicate people.''

LASER BEAM DESTROYS A NAVY CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lt. Jack Daly is looking for some answers to a mysterious laser
incident 22 months ago that left him in constant pain and has
wrecked a once-promising career in U.S. naval intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Daly was serving as a liaison officer to the Canadian Maritime
Defense Force at Esquimalt, B.C., in the spring of 1997 when he
went on a routine surveillance flight to photograph a Russian
freighter suspected by U.S. and Canadian officials of snooping on
the Trident ballistic missile submarines based at Bangor, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   While photographing the M/V Kapitan Man, Daly and the Canadian
helicopter pilot, Capt. Pat Barnes, were struck by a laser beam
that caused serious lesions to their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a pain-free day since the incident,'' Daly said
in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Daly is scheduled to tell his story to a congressional
committee examining the threat to military personnel from lasers
and other high-tech weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., has summoned the intelligence and
research chiefs from each of the four armed services to testify
about high-tech weaponry and the Pentagon's proposed
countermeasures. Hunter, chairman of the House Armed Services
procurement subcommittee, is also concerned about alleged espionage
by Russian commercial ships inside U.S. waters, according to his
press secretary, Harald Stavanas.
</P>
<P>
   Daly, a 40-year-old Philadelphia native, says he is glad to have
the opportunity to testify about laser threats, particularly since
two U.S. military personnel in Bosnia were similarly injured in
Bosnia last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But his satisfaction is bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career is down the toilet,'' said Daly, who enlisted in the
Navy in 1982 and won an officer's commission seven years later. He
said his downfall came after he and Canadian officials submitted
incident reports on the April 4, 1997, laser firing.
</P>
<P>
   The Kapitan Man was five miles west of Port Angeles in the
eastbound shipping lanes of the Strait of Juan de Fuca when the
Canadian helicopter bearing Daly and Barnes approached to take
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the laser burn symptoms appeared the next morning,
the ship had entered the Port of Tacoma to unload and take on
cargo, Daly and Barnes said in separate interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon ordered a search of the ship but the boarding team
didn't appear until more than 72 hours had gone by, Daly said. No
evidence of a laser was found.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent Pentagon investigation confirmed the two officers
had been struck by a laser beam but said it could not determine
whether the laser was fired from the Russian ship.
</P>
<P>
   Daly claims the investigation into the incident was poorly
conducted and that it tried to disprove that the two men had been
injured by a laser. He filed an official report challenging its
findings. Since then, Daly says, he has been passed over for
promotion and faces the likelihood of having to retire from active
duty later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials would not comment on whether there was
political pressure to warn the Russians of the search and downplay
the incident, as Daley claims.
</P>
<P>
   Several other intelligence officials, who requested anonymity,
have said the Kapitan Man and other ships in the Russian Far
Eastern Shipping Co. fleet have attempted to track Trident
submarines ever since Puget Sound ports were opened to vessels from
the former Soviet Union eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., says he has received briefings
confirming the Pentagon's suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Daly alleged the Pentagon and the Canadian military halted the
surveillance flights of the Russian ships immediately after the
1997 laser incident.
</P>
<P>
   One senior member of the staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at
the time told the Post-Intelligencer there was ``a great desire to
have this incident go away'' because the Clinton administration was
concerned about its relations with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Daly has undergone extensive treatment for the burns to his eyes
at the Brook Army Medical Center in Texas. He says it is not known
whether his eyes will fully heal or whether the pain from the
lesions will subside.

SAVARESE GETS A FRESH START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Giovanni Savarese planned to be in Italy
this week, but not with the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese was the New York/New Jersey MetroStars' leading scorer
and the No. 3 scorer in Major League Soccer after the league's
first three seasons. But Savarese felt rejected by the MetroStars
and was unable to negotiate a satisfactory raise from MLS, so he
had been exploring other options.
</P>
<P>
   The search became a return to roots for Savarese, whose family
emigrated from Campania to Caracas and then Massachusetts. He lived
with relatives while training with AS Napoli's ``B'' team and would
have stayed, but the Revolution acquired his rights and offered a
fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   So Savarese returned last week to become acquainted with his new
teammates and left with them Wednesday bound for Tuscany, where the
Revolution begin a six-week training camp.
</P>
<P>
   With the MetroStars, Savarese earned a reputation as an
opportunist and overachiever. He scored 41 goals in three seasons,
the team's most consistent and dynamic offensive weapon. But he was
relegated to reserve status and did not seem likely to emerge under
coach Bora Milutinovic.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution player-coach Walter Zenga hopes to use Savarese in a
starting role to help set the tactical tone. The team's strikers
will be expected to close down opposing attacks before they can get
started _ and score goals as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to Walter about a lot of things,'' Savarese said
Tuesday. ``But we haven't really talked about my role on this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great in New York because of the fans. The people
treated me well. But things didn't go so well with the team. I'd
rather not talk about the problems in New York because I'm happy to
be here now, for a lot of reasons _ I have a lot of faith in
Walter, I have family living here, it's a great stadium to play in
with great fans, and I'm still close to New York and Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   Savarese was recruited to the United States by former Long
Island University coach Arnie Ramirez and played for LIU and the
Long Island Roughriders. He is among the few athletes from
Venezuela to achieve success in the US other than in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to love him in Boston,'' Ramirez said. ``I don't
know why three coaches benched him, but he was still the
MetroStars' top scorer. If they give him confidence there, he will
show what he can do. He's an excellent player who gives everything.
Anyone who watched the MetroStars the last three years can't say he
was ever going through the motions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played sweeper, stopper, and forward at LIU. People think
he can only score very close to the goal, but it's not true. In a
game against Syracuse, he took the kickoff, took a pass from Walter
Bustamante, and scored in seven seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Savarese has had to work fast during the offseason. He was
married in November in Caracas _ there were more than 450 guests _
but skipped the honeymoon to pursue his soccer career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe after the season, we will take a cruise,'' Saverese
said. ``Where? Probably in the Mediterranean.''

asks what I would like to drink. White wine, I tell her. What kind
of white wine, she wants to know. Chardonnay. What style of
chardonnay? She places a stemmed glass _ real glass _ on my tray
table and asks if I'd like to taste her recommendation. I swirl it.
It's fine. But is it the right temperature? she asks. It is. She
calls back to her colleague in the galley, asking her to put
another bottle in the fridge, in case I'd like more.
</P>
<P>
   South Africans take their wine seriously, in the air or on the
ground. I met a group of University of Cape Town students, party
animals all, who knew their way around a wine list as few American
undergrads would (and who mentioned that when students hit a wine
route, one wine farm will call ahead to warn the next one down the
road, which will promptly close in self-defense).
</P>
<P>
   Wine in South Africa is an everyday beverage at an everyday
price. At Delheim Wines near Stellenbosch, east of Cape Town, I
chanced upon a tasting of 15 or so South African whites from
various wine farms _ all selling for under $5 a bottle. Many were
quite good, although some were a bit sweet for American tastes.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing grape variety in South Africa is still chenin
blanc, used primarily in off-dry wines, but the wine industry,
conscious of what sells abroad, is catching up to other countries'
preference for dry wines, focusing more on sauvignon blanc and
chardonnay. The chardonnays are often lighter and less wooded than
Californian and Australian versions, and the sauvignon blancs more
assertive. Before my recent trip to South Africa, a sauvignon blanc
with a flinty finish _ from Neil Ellis, another vintner in the
Stellenbosch area _ had already become my house wine. It sells for
$11.99 in my suburban Boston wine shop, and for $5 at the winery.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa also has a wine unique to the country _ pinotage, a
hybrid born of the 1920s marriage of pinot noir and cinsault. A
South African oenophile tells me that in the 1980s, pinotage used
to taste like nail polish remover (which I had to assume he'd
tried, but I didn't ask under what circumstances). A
light-to-medium red wine, often with banana flavors, pinotage is
being taken more seriously now than in the past and allowed to
mature in oak more often. The new, more grown-up pinotage is
perfectly paired with South Africa's most popular specialty meat _
ostrich.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more liberating aspects of a wine-lover's trip to
South Africa is that even in restaurants and hotels, wine is
affordable. Consider a favorite chardonnay from my trip, the '96
Glen Carlou, a voluptuous, buttery, award-winning wine, the kind of
chardonnay that feels fattening. It was unavailable at the winery,
so I started asking for it in restaurants, even when it wasn't on
the wine list. Finally, I lucked out at a chic Cape Town cafe
called Fresh, which sold me its last bottle for $10.
</P>
<P>
   While the focus on improved table wines is recent, South
Africa's wine industry _ currently eighth largest in the world _
has a long history. Thanks to Jan van Riebeck, founder of the Cape
colony, the beginning of the industry can be pinpointed precisely.
On Feb. 2, 1659, van Riebeck wrote in his diary, ``Today, praise be
to God, wine was made for the first time from Cape grapes.''
Shortly after, Cape Governor Simon van der Stel started South
Africa's first wine estate, Groot Constantia, which became famous
for its sweet wines. French Huguenots, fleeing their native country
because of religious persecution, arrived later in the 17th
century, bringing with them a knowledge of and taste for fine
wines. The exiled Napoleon drank wines from Groot Constantia
exclusively, but that might have had something to do with
bitterness toward France as well as with the sweetness of South
African wines. Truth to tell, the quality of Groot Constantia today
isn't up to the level of many vintages produced by the region's
smaller estates.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has a complex relationship with France in matters
of wine. One South African told me that during apartheid, when
South Africa was cut off from much of the world, guests would be
invited to homes to drink French wine, specifying ``French'' in the
invitation because it was more prestigious than the native tipple.
Another South African told me that was nonsense, that the country
realized the potential of its wines right along, and bought French
wines only for comparative purposes. France exerts a certain amount
of influence over the naming of South African wines. The French
Institute of National Origin, which protects its wine industry,
recently forced South Africa's Haute Provence Vineyards to remove
the labels from 6,000 bottles of its 1998 sauvignon blanc, because
``Haute Provence'' is also the name of a wine region in France.
</P>
<P>
   Politics, phylloxera, government regulation, and the loosening
thereof have all affected South Africa's wine industry. What
matters most to the wine tourist of today, though, is that you can
have a wonderful time exploring the wine estates clustered within
an hour's drive of Cape Town, which is often touted as the world's
most beautiful city. The wine farms are also beautiful, each with
its own personality. The historic ones have Cape Dutch architecture
that suggests Amsterdam South _ whitewashed homesteads topped with
ornate curling gables. Newer ones have a futuristic feel.
</P>
<P>
   Vergelegen is both. The gorgeous property in Somerset West, on
the edge of the winelands, dates from 1700. But in addition to a
classic Cape Dutch manor house with thatched roof, there is an
ultramodern winery whose octagonal shape mirrors Vergelegen's lush
flower garden. The winery burrows into a hilltop, to exploit
gravity in the wine-making process. The grapes travel ever
downward, from harvest to fermentation to press to barrel, which is
at the bottom. The building is actually inside a moat, the water
providing insulation, the theory being that grapes respond well to
gentle handling. Vergelegen's wines are exported to Europe _ but
not yet to the United States. So you'll have to travel to try the
excellent '96 chardonnay reserve.
</P>
<P>
   One of South Africa's greatest reds is the 1993 Saxenburg Shiraz
Private Collection, included in Wine Spectator magazine's 1996 list
of the world's top 100 wines _ the only South African to make the
cut that year. It's an opulent wine, with peppery and blackberry
flavors. Unavailable at the wine farm, it is on the wine list at
the Guinea Fowl Restaurant, another part of the estate. Its price _
about $32 _ is among the highest you'll find on any South African
menu. Saxenburg's Swiss owners are also the proprietors of Chateau
Capion in the South of France. Hence the marriages of wines from
both estates, overseen by winemaker Nico van der Merwe, who divides
his time between South Africa and France.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're exploring South African wines in American shops
or trekking to the country of origin, arm yourself with the current
edition of John Platter's annual ``South African Wines.'' The most
respected overview of the field, it is written with clarity and
without overdoing the technical terms.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the chance to sample the many wines that aren't
exported to the United States, one of the pleasures of enjoying
South African wine in South Africa is the many restaurants attached
to wine farms. They range from humble and publike to world-class
and sophisticated. In the former category is Delheim's Vintner's
Platter. Among the wines I sampled was the fresh, clean,
easy-to-drink Woolworths Bianca Light. After I expressed surprise
at the name, Delheim's vintner, Spatz Sperling, assured me that in
South Africa, Woolworths is a more upmarket store than in the
United States. ``It's more like Harrods,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Among the very top restaurants affiliated with a winery is
Buitenverwachting, where I had an elaborate lunch, trying different
wines with each course. ``Buitenverwachting'' I found impossible to
pronounce, but I had no problem at all with the very familiar name
of the winery's top red. A mostly cabernet sauvignon blend that
regularly ranks among South Africa's greats, it's called
``Christine.''

OFFICIALLY, THIS CALL IS OUTRAGEOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Zebra Chronicles, Part Whatever . . .
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you caught the end of last Saturday's DePaul-Cincinnati
men's basketball game at the Rosemont Horizon. If you did, you may
not have been as outraged as I, but I'd be very surprised if you
weren't, well, perplexed, because what happened was so completely
out there as to border on the surreal.
</P>
<P>
   With 20 seconds or so remaining in the overtime of a tie game,
Cincinnati had the basketball. It was holding for the last shot.
Bearcat star Melvin Levitt was, as Johnny Most would say,
``fiddling and diddling'' with the ball when he got a bit too cute
and attempted a crossover dribble in front of DePaul's Willie
Crawford, who said, ``I'll take that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Crawford was dashing the other way with Levitt in pursuit.
The seconds were trickling away. Not long after he crossed
midcourt, a completely out-of-control Crawford, his (itals)back to
the basket,(unitals) flung the ball in the general direction of the
hoop. The ball fell several feet short. The buzzer went off. Second
OT, no?
</P>
<P>
   Uh, no.
</P>
<P>
   That's because referee Paul Kaster, to the delight of DePaul,
the horror of Cincinnati, and the astonishment of both the crowd in
attendance and the many thousands watching on television, blew the
whistle. He called a foul on Levitt, whose only crime might have
been loitering. If anything, Crawford lunged into Levitt.
</P>
<P>
   Confusing the issue even more was the fact that Crawford was
given two shots when he was clearly far outside the 3-point arc.
Anyway, the DePaul kid missed the first and ba-boinged in the
second. Final score: DePaul 61, Cincinnati 60.
</P>
<P>
   On a 1-to-10 scale of injustice, this was at least an 11 1/2,
and I say that as no lover of Cincinnati, a leading candidate for
the Evil Empire in the college basketball world. But fair is fair,
and what happened to Cincinnati was not just a bad call. A sincere
misjudgment on a block-charge, shot block vs. hack, or goaltend is
one thing, but this was something else. This was a referee
demonstrating a complete and utter lack of common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The referees' guiding principle,'' says Hank Nichols, the
NCAA's national coordinator of men's basketball officials and
himself one of the great referees of all time, ``is to let players
do whatever they can to win the game without your interference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to use `referees' smarts,' '' concurs Atlantic 10
officiating supervisor Micky Crowley, another of the great
common-sense referees in the history of college basketball. ``You
let the kids determine who wins and loses ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these esteemed experts would comment directly on the
call in question, for obvious reasons. Of course, it's not as if I
need any confirmation that this was a truly disturbing call.
</P>
<P>
   This had nothing to do with ``letting them play.'' Many people
are of the opinion that it's not proper for the referee to call
anything short of first-degree murder in the waning seconds of
game, a notion that makes both these gentlemen sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Circumstances are irrelevant,'' stresses Nichols. ``If it's a
foul, it's a foul, and it doesn't matter if it's the first
possession of the game or at the buzzer. If a guy thinks he sees a
foul at the buzzer, he has an obligation to call it. That's why
he's there.''
</P>
<P>
   Who can argue? We've all seen any number of situations at every
level in which something takes place requiring a very tough
decision in the waning seconds. A guy goes to the hoop, for
example, and there is a blocked shot. A referee has to decide if
contact was made either way. That's difficult, but it has to be
done. We all understand that and we all understand that
(itals)someone(unitals) will be outraged, no matter which way it
goes.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But this thing last Saturday now serves as Exhibit A to support
my basic thesis about basketball officiating. Simply put, before
taking the floor, every official should ask himself the following
question: Why am I here?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, I submit, is to adjudicate the smooth flow of the
game. Anyone adhering to that principle may still make errors in
mechanics and specific call judgment, but he will not make idiot
calls such as the one that decided last Saturday's game in
Rosemont.
</P>
<P>
   If Mr. Kaster had any idea why he was sent to officiate the
DePaul-Cincinnati game, he would never have sent someone who had
just flung a basketball _ again, I stress, (itals)with his back to
the basket(unitals) _ to the foul line with a chance to win the
game. If he understood why he was there _ if he understood that
when in doubt, let the players decide the game _ then he would have
allowed the game to head into a second overtime. What he did was
take 44 minutes 59 seconds of hard-nosed basketball and render it
secondary to his bizarre interpretation of what constitutes justice
in a basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the game,'' says Nichols, ``you hope you have
something legitimate if you blow the whistle. But officials aren't
told anything specific about the end of a game. Having common sense
is implicit in the job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to make a call at the end of a game,'' adds
Crowley, ``you'd better be (itals)sure(unitals) you've got
something good.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK, not all officials are created equal. ``I don't know if
there is anything you can say or do to make 700 officials all see
the same thing,'' sighs Nichols. ``That's why you have great
officials, mediocre officials, and bad officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most inappropriate display Saturday was the sorry
act put on by DePaul coach Pat Kennedy, who was beaming broadly and
high-fiving half of Illinois after his team had been handed this
bogus win. Has he no shame whatsoever? What he should have done was
walk with his head down toward Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins and
whisper, ``Hug, I'm truly embarrassed. I hope this evens out for
you somewhere down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be asking too much of a college coach in the pressure
cooker, just as it may be asking too much of every official to ask
himself just why it is someone is paying him to run around with
that whistle. But if some referee wants to know what not to do in
an end-of-game situation, all he has to do is grab the tape of last
Saturday's DePaul-Cincinnati game. It doesn't get any more
ludicrous that that.

AIDS ACTIVIST REGGIE WILLIAMS DIES AT 47 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Ohio, California)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Reggie Williams, the former head of the National
Task Force on AIDS Prevention, died Sunday in the Netherlands of
complications of the AIDS virus. He was 47.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Williams was viewed as a hero for his fight against the
cultural barriers that continue to keep the AIDS infection rate
high among non-white Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we've lost many heroes, but he was an
extraordinary individual. He was one of the more effective leaders
during the entire peak of the AIDS epidemic in the city,'' said Dr.
Sandra Hernandez, who worked closely with Mr. Williams during her
years in San Francisco's AIDS Office and as the city's public
health director.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Williams grew up in Cincinnati, became an X-ray technician
and moved to Los Angeles in the exuberant days of gay liberation in
the 1970s. It was at Cedars Sinai Hospital there that he first
began seeing patients severely ill with what was then called
Gay-Related Immune Disease.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he settled in San Francisco in the early 1980s, the
acquired immune deficiency syndrome was approaching its full fury _
and Mr. Williams was one of the first to recognize that prevention
efforts weren't reaching gay and bisexual blacks, or other gay
minorities. He called a meeting at his home to take action,
according to colleague and friend Al Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the AIDS Task Force of the San Francisco chapter
of Black and White Men Together (now Men of All Colors Together),
from which emerged the National Task Force on AIDS Prevention,
which Mr. Williams ran from 1988 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Its aim was to break down the homophobia and other cultural
barriers that kept black, Hispanic and Asian men who had sex with
other men from seeing themselves as gay _ or from recognizing the
risk of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In the first national survey of its kind, Mr. Williams'
organization discovered that a full third of black gay and bisexual
men were privately homosexual but publicly involved with women.
</P>
<P>
   ``These men go into a relationship with a woman because they
need to feel accepted within the ranks of the black community. As a
result, there's greater risk that the virus will spread not only
among them, but among women and the family when they go home,'' Mr.
Williams said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Williams himself served as a role model, and as a leader who
was able to reach bureaucrats as well as people on the street. All
the while, he battled the human immunodeficiency virus, which leads
to AIDS, for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very much an unsung hero,'' said Hernandez, now head of
the San Francisco Foundation, a philanthropic organization. ``He
didn't get a lot of awards. But he was a bridge builder across a
lot of different communities, especially in the African-American
community, which early on didn't embrace this epidemic as being
relevant to them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Mr. Williams moved to Amsterdam to be with his partner,
German-born Wolfgang Schreiber. Schreiber was prohibited by U.S.
law from moving here because he has HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The organization Mr. Williams founded has since folded. But his
work continues through Cunningham and Yours in the Struggle, a
multimedia and community education project.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities now accounting for 58 percent of new HIV infections
nationally, Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Schreiber, Mr. Williams is survived by four
sisters, Connie Rudolph and Phyllis Williams of Cincinnati, Denise
Williams of Landover, Md., and Vanessa Williams of Encinitas,
Calif.; three brothers, Aaron, Dwight and Michael of Cincinnati;
plus many nieces and nephews.

60S ACTIVIST BLASTS PRISON POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Nearly three decades after political
activism landed her in jail after a celebrated stint on the FBI's
10 Most Wanted list, Angela Davis is more troubled than ever about
the number of black and disadvantaged Americans being swept out of
circulation behind prison walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is this society so willing to lock up people in cages?''
Davis told more than 300 people at Skidmore College.
</P>
<P>
   She argued that prisons are the nation's most common
post-slavery technique for legally denying African-Americans their
civil rights and shutting the door on people troubled by mental
illness, drug addiction, illiteracy and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prisons have become a place to throw away people with problems
... and act as though we have solved those problems,'' Davis said
in the Sunday address. ``Prisons have become places of exile for
people who are considered expendable.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, now in her mid-50s, is a professor at the University of
California at Santa Cruz. She lost an early teaching job at the
University of California at Los Angeles in 1969 because of her
affiliation with the Communist Party, and she spent 16 months in
jail after advocating the release of the ``Soledad Brothers'' held
in a California prison.
</P>
<P>
   She was released in 1972 after she was acquitted on charges that
she was involved in a kidnapping attempt. Today, the Afro is gone,
and her hair is now highlighted and worn in long, soft curls.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Davis said, a black man is five times more likely
to be found in prison than in a state university. And in New York,
she said, increased spending on prison construction is an example
of how the ``prison-industrial complex'' robs funding and attention
from education, health care, and treatment of mental illness and
drug addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Often, those serving long prison sentences for nonviolent drug
crimes would pose little danger to others in their community, but
their incarceration serves a political urge to ``construct an
enemy,'' she said. She equated it with the Cold War view of
Communists as the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, prison expansion serves an ever-expanding world of
capitalist commercial interests _ including collect telephone
services, construction trades and the sale of security technology _
that reinforce the drive to build more prisons, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   As she concluded, Davis urged her listeners to reach out to
those inside prisons. A ``go to prison week'' is slated for April
11-18 as part of a campaign to change U.S. criminal justice and
prison policies, and she encouraged audience members to visit
people they know in prison or arrange prison tours with church or
school groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a little time in jail, and I definitely do not want to
go back, but I will try to get in for at least a few hours,'' Davis
said.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Davis offered a professorial lecture infused with warmth. As a
high school senior, she told the group, she applied to Skidmore and
was accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always tried to imagine what it would have been like if I
had come here,'' she said, evoking murmurs and quiet laughter as
older listeners mulled the unspoken reference to her life as a
famous California campus radical.
</P>
<P>
   Davis spoke for more than an hour and then responded to
questions and comments from her listeners, including anti-prison
activist Alice Green, a frequent critic of Gov. George Pataki and
New York's prison policies.

SCHOOL SYSTEM URGED TO REINSTATE PRINCIPAL ACCUSED OF
ANTI-SEMITISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Stands for SPANISH-TEACHER)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Parents, teachers and students are pushing the
San Francisco school district to reinstate a popular principal who
was accused of making anti-Semitic remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Cesar Chavez Elementary School Principal Pilar Mejia,
who started her career in the school district as a bus driver and
went on to become one of the most outspoken defenders of immigrant
children, apologized Tuesday for having lamented that ``three white
Jewish women'' were teaching Spanish-speaking kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intention was simply to point out that Spanish-speaking
children at the pre-K level were being taught by teachers who did
not speak Spanish and were not of Hispanic descent,'' Mejia said,
drawing a standing ovation from some 100 parents, teachers and
children gathered at Everett Middle School in San Francisco Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time the statement was made, it was not intended to
reflect negatively on anyone's ethnic or religious background, but
I can understand how it could be interpreted as such,'' said Mejia,
52. ``I would like to sit down and resolve this.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's school superintendent, Bill Rojas said: ``If that was
the only thing she said, then it wouldn't be problematical.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas said Mejia's transfer on Feb. 1 to the district's
curriculum improvement and professional development center was
final and non-negotiable. He characterized a claim filed by a
teacher charging Mejia with anti-Semitism as ``an issue of very
serious litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of Mejia's desire to settle the claim, Rojas said, ``That's
nice _ and naive.''
</P>
<P>
   Mejia's transfer from the Mission District school _ where half
the 540 children are Hispanic and 65 percent speak little if any
English, and 71 percent qualify for free or reduced-price lunches _
came more than 18 months after Mejia made the ``three white Jewish
women'' statement.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, Mejia said, she told four part-time
pre-kindergarten teachers that when she first arrived at Cesar
Chavez in 1991, the teachers were Jewish and did not speak Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia said she later had apologized for the remark, explaining
she hadn't meant to offend anyone. The trouble began for Mejia when
she moved to consolidate the four part-time positions into two
full-time positions, according to San Francisco teachers union
President Kent Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mitchell, the four part-time teachers were equally
qualified. One, however, had seniority. Because she was not chosen
for the full-time position, she filed the grievance.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher won the grievance and works part time at Chavez.
``During the course of investigating that grievance, the
allegations came up of anti-Semitic conduct,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, in what began as a candlelight march from the
school to the Board of Education meeting, parents decried the
district, denounced the superintendent and deified Mejia.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia's former husband, Frank Duhl, was the first in line to
assail the anti-Semitic charges against Mejia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Pilar for 30 years,'' said Duhl, who is Jewish.
``We have two sons. She is not anti-Jew. She is a strong, caring
Latina woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The superintendent removed her because she was accused of
intolerance,'' he said. ``This is a woman who has been fighting
intolerance and injustice for all of her life.''
</P>
<P>
   The only person to speak in defense of the superintendent's
decision was Tracy Salkowitz, executive director of the American
Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that angered the crowd, she said, ``The
superintendent is a man of incredible integrity. He has made a
thoughtful decision. If a white principal were to insist that all
white kids be taught by white teachers, that principal would be
removed _ immediately.''

YOU'RE BEING WATCHED _ OR MAYBE NOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I heard that Microsoft is planning to make the
new Pentium with a special transmitter that will let them track you
whenever you log on to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heightened Awareness
</P>
<P>
   DEAR HEIGHTENED: You have a mighty high opinion of yourself. Why
in the world would Microsoft care what you do? You're really not
that interesting. I know. I've been tracking you myself.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, I know everybody thinks Microsoft is pure evil,
but this really isn't its doing. It makes software. Intel makes the
chips, and even though most Intel machines run on Microsoft
operating systems, they don't absolutely have to.
</P>
<P>
   Intel built what amounts to a unique serial number inside the
new Pentium III chips, ostensibly as an added level of security.
Let's say your rat-faced neighbor swipes your user ID and password
for your online travel service. Since your credit card number is on
file there, he can easily sit next door and book himself and his
frumpy wife and ugly kid on the next slow boat to China, all at
your expense. If, however, that site also required that any
transaction be done from a PC with a known serial number, they
could reject the sale and notify you. You'd be well within your
rights at that point to walk next door and knock over his stupid
birdbath and ceramic chickens.
</P>
<P>
   When the self-appointed guardians of Internet privacy got wind
of this serial-number plan, they went ballistic and started
threatening boycotts. Intel reacted by turning the security feature
off, but that doesn't mean some Poindexter with an itch to see how
many times you visit the Nervous Sheep in Bondage home page can't
figure a way to switch it back on.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there are already so many ways to keep track of things
like that, one more isn't going usher in the New World Order. Waste
your paranoia on better stuff.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: The majority of the people believe that the
21st century starts on Jan. 1, 2000. It should commence on Jan. 1,
2001. Please help correct this general fallacy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stickler
</P>
<P>
   DEAR STICK: Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Who cares when
it begins? Our calendar is just an arbitrary numbering system that
not everyone uses anyway. In fact, I declare that the 21st century
begins ... wait a second ... almost ... hold it ... now! Happy New
Year!
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I want to buy a program so that all a seller
has to do is type in the product code and it will print the
invoice, deduct the item from inventory, add in the tax, etc. It
must be so simple that my rather slow wife can use it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Merchant Of Venom
</P>
<P>
   DEAR MERCHANT: You know, I'm so happy my appeal extends even to
folks like you. Here, I'll speak so you can understand:
</P>
<P>
   Wife not slow. Wife no like magic box. Mama Bombay no like magic
box either. You call Mama slow too? Me get club and spear. Unn

COMPUTER BRIEFS: TAKING A WEB MEETING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (ms) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without traveling, how does a San Francisco-based developer of
Web sites get prompt approval for design changes from a client who
is in the South Pacific?
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Web developer Parlez Communications, the
answer is the Webex Meeting Center, www.webex.com, a ``virtual
meeting'' Web site that Parlez and other users have been testing.
The Webex site, which is operated by the start-up company Active
Touch Inc. of Santa Clara, Calif., officially opens for business on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The site allows users who are linked to one another by standard
telephone and the Internet to discuss and work collaboratively on
documents, spreadsheets and other application software for personal
computers running Microsoft Windows. Parlez was able to use the
site, for example, to meet on line with a client in the Cook
Islands to discuss changes for a graphics project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can make changes in real time, and the client can observe
that,'' said Ike DeLorenzo, president of Parlez.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in Webex meetings share control over applications,
so that even if they are miles apart they can add or subtract
elements to a common project. A graphic designer might polish a
document layout, for example, and then turn cursor control over to
a copy editor to edit or trim the text, while all involved in the
virtual meeting watch the changes being made.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can also make telephone conference calls on Webex, for
15 cents a minute. Or they can arrange their own conference calls,
if they prefer. If they would rather dispense with the phone
entirely, they can use their keyboards to communicate through text
chat.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike popular collaborative software already on the market,
such as Lotus Notes or Timbuktu, Webex does not require users to
buy and install special software on their PC's. Either of the two
standard Web browser programs _ Netscape Navigator or Microsoft
Internet Explorer _ will suffice.
</P>
<P>
   Most Webex services except teleconferencing will be free. But
anyone who wants to use the site cleared of advertising will pay a
fee. Active Touch intends to offer business customers an ad-free
meeting service with additional security features for $1,000 a
month. Individuals and small companies can book the site ad free
for $5 a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Active Touch expects the likeliest customers for the service to
be consultants and software companies that want to demonstrate
their products on line. The company is also licensing the
virtual-meeting technology to companies that want to develop their
own services _ as the Baan Co., a producer of corporate computing
software, has done in creating an online service called Cyber
Consult that Baan peddles to its own customers.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Webex catches the market's fancy or is simply a
precursor to other offerings of this type, some analysts expect the
concept to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the telephone did for global voice communication, this
class of product is going to do for data visualization,'' said
Stephen Hendrick, a vice president at the International Data
Corporation, a research firm in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Tact For Sale
</P>
<P>
   Boss has bad breath? Time for Uncle Foster to do something about
that unsightly nose hair? To convey a sensitive message discreetly,
a new Web site called gentlehints.com will send a letter _ along
with an appropriate enclosure to reinforce the message _ for a
small fee. Anonymity assured.
</P>
<P>
   The process is simple: The user selects from 13 offending
characteristics _ including bad breath, talking too much and body
odor _ then fills out an online form with names and addresses.
Thanks to the magic of electronic commerce and credit cards,
gentlehints.com then sends off an anonymous letter along with
mouthwash, say, or a bar of soap.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the list of offenses are dandruff, flatulence and,
specifically for women, facial hair (for which a pair of tweezers
is enclosed).
</P>
<P>
   Most letters cost $7.95, although one that includes a book on
table manners or a trimmer for ear hair goes for $14.95. You can
also request a letter for an offense that is not on the standard
list.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Ford, one of three friends in Los Angeles who started the
business, says all the letters are diplomatic, worded gently to
offer solutions rather than to attack. She and her friends came up
with the idea, she said, because each one had in the past been
faced with the predicament of ``how to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One usually hesitates to say or do anything that will
jeopardize a relationship with another,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That is where gentlehints.com can help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone who cares about you and doesn't want to hurt your
feelings wants you to know you sometimes have halitosis (bad
breath),'' reads one letter. ``It is often difficult to find just
the right words when attempting to bring a problem situation to a
friend, co-worker or family member, as we do not want to offend
that individual or jeopardize our relationship with them. That is
the reason why gentlehints.com was asked to send you this letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Since opening for business last August, the site has received
positive response from senders and recipients alike, Ms. Ford said.
But she and her partners are not banking that a wave of frankness _
even of the masked variety _ will grow into a business that can
support them. Just in case, they have kept their day jobs, in
investment sales, nursing and teaching.

IT'S AT&AMP;T VS. AOL IN LOBBYING WAR OVER HIGH-SPEED INTERNET
CONNECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As AT&AMP;T Corp. aggressively enters the cable
business, with plans to offer high-speed Internet connections to
millions of American homes, a growing group of rivals and consumer
groups has begun a nationwide lobbying effort to force the
telephone giant to open its system to Internet competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The fight pits AT&AMP;T, which has struck cable deals in recent
months that will give it access to nearly half of the nation's
homes, against a coalition led by America Online, the world's
largest internet service provider with 15 million customers. It has
also drawn a large group of companies that are the Internet
gateways for millions of Americans, as well as some prominent
former Washington officials who are now lobbyists working for the
telephone industry, the cable industry and the Internet service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest issue in the whole technology
communications realm,'' said Charles M. Brewer, chairman and chief
executive of MindSpring Enterprises Inc., an Internet service
provider with about 340,000 subscribers, which has joined with
America Online, US West, MCI WorldCom and others on Wednesday in
formally announcing their coalition, called OpenNet.

<P>
   AT&AMP;T is expected to receive approval from federal regulators as
early as this month to complete its $31 billion acquisition of
Tele-Communications Inc., a leading cable company. Earlier this
week, AT&AMP;T also reached an agreement with Time Warner to offer
local telephone service through that company's cable systems, which
serve 12 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   By marrying cable and the Internet, AT&AMP;T will be able to offer
consumers throughout the nation the ability to navigate through the
World Wide Web at speeds up to 100 times as fast as those provided
by ordinary telephone lines. With high-speed service delivered over
cable modems, images on personal computers appear so fast that they
resemble television screens, a prospect that holds the promise of
significantly expanding commerce on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a catch. AT&AMP;T intends to require that any customer
who subscribes to its high-speed cable modem service must also pay
a monthly fee of $40 or so for the Internet access that will be
provided by At Home Corp., of which AT&AMP;T will be the largest
shareholder after it completes its acquisition of TCI.
</P>
<P>
   That has prompted protests by other Internet providers, who fear
they may be frozen out and who complain that AT&AMP;T will control the
computer standards on the Internet for video, audio and other kinds
of transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides say the outcome of the battle _ which is just
beginning before regulators and Congress here and in courts and
municipalities around the nation _ may determine whether the
Internet will continue to be a free-wheeling technology or will be
dominated by a handful of large corporate interests.
</P>
<P>
   And both say the fight will determine the speed with which the
Internet develops into a more accessible force in commerce,
entertainment and research, as well as which companies survive the
shakeout of the nascent industry and which profit the most as the
Internet matures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet would not be happening but for the fact that
consumers can now choose their service provider in an unimpeded
way,'' Brewer said. ``If we had to rely the owners of the last mile
of transmission, it's unquestionable that the Internet would not
have developed as it has.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at AT&AMP;T and the cable companies respond that America
Online and other competitors are trying to muscle in and make use
of technological improvements to the cable systems that are
requiring investments of billions of dollars. They say there will
be plenty of other providers of high-speed access to the Internet,
such as digital telephone technology and satellites. Moreover, they
say, customers will be able to use other Internet providers on
their system, although the customers will have to pay extra.
</P>
<P>
   The executives of AT&AMP;T and its cable allies contend that
revenues from At Home will help to defray the huge capital costs
associated with upgrading the cable system and that the cable
companies did not develop the technology simply to provide what
they call a ``dumb pipeline'' for competitors to take advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the fight is over the most valuable real estate of the
Internet, the desktop, which holds the promise of delivering
advertising, commerce and entertainment on an unparalleled new
scale. Consequently, the struggle is as much over pixels as it is
over pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain arrogance to their position, which confuses
what's good for AOL with what's good for the Internet,'' said James
W. Cicconi, general counsel and head of government relations at
AT&AMP;T. ``It's certainly disingenuous and borders on hypocrisy to say
for years that the government should stay out of regulating the
Internet and then suddenly invite the government in when their
business interests change. This is just a very big competitive
player trying to disadvantage a smaller player that came up with a
better idea.''
</P>
<P>
   While scores of companies are trying to develop higher-speed
Internet service through telephones and satellites, some experts
believe that cable modems ultimately hold the greatest promise of
making the World Wide Web much faster, and therefore much more
attractive to computer users and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   At least 350,000 homes _ some estimates run as high as 700,000 _
now have some kind of high speed Internet service, according to a
study released on Wednesday by the Federal Communications
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts like Forrester Research Inc. estimate that by the
end of 2002, 16 million American households will have high-speed
computer connections to the Internet, and nearly 80 percent of
those will be through cable-based providers like At Home and its
top competitor, Road Runner, a unit of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Although some analysts and executives involved in the fight
believe the regulatory war is simply a sideshow to a possible
commercial settlement, both AT&AMP;T and AOL are prepared to spend
millions of dollars for lobbying and legal expenses and have
retained a number of the biggest lobbying and press relations firms
in Washington and around the nation. The fight is being waged on
four fronts: in Congress, at the Federal Communications Commission,
before local cable regulators in cities around the country, and in
the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups have lined up with AOL, contending that AT&AMP;T and
the cable companies are attemping to control the content of what
passes through their wires, just as they tried to control what
programs appeared on their channels before that practice was
prohibited by an act of Congress.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On one side in the fight are the formidable lobbying forces of
AT&AMP;T and Tele-Communications Inc., two of the most powerful players
in Washington. The companies have an impressive roster of lobbyists
and lawyers who once worked in the federal government and Congress.
They include Cicconi, a former top White House official in Reagan
and Bush administrations and now the general counsel of AT&AMP;T;
Philip L. Verveer, a leading telecommunications lawyer and close
friend of Bill Clinton since their days together at Georgetown
University, whose wife is the chief of staff to Hillary Rodham
Clinton; and Kevin Joseph, who recently stepped down as senior
counsel to Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition on the other side is being led by Greg Simon, the
former domestic policy adviser to Vice President Gore, and Richard
Bond, former chairman of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are doing what Microsoft is accused of doing - building a
system where they say you can't separate the transmission from the
actual content,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the
Washington office of Consumers Union, referring to the government's
antitrust suit filed against the software company. ``They're saying
if you want AOL, we'll let you have it but you have to pay At Home
first. This is precisely what telephone companies can't do. The
request from our side is, Let's open up access to cable wire the
same way we require them to open up for programming.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the Federal Communications Commission has
declined to step into the fight but has said it will watch the
situation closely. Officials there say they do not want to do
anything that might impede the progress of upgrading the cable
lines.
</P>
<P>
   But cable regulators in a growing number of cities, including
San Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle, have held hearings and
vowed to consider the issue as franchise licenses are renewed this
year. And one city, Portland, Ore., has blocked AT&AMP;T's cable
venture from moving in without first opening its proposed new
broadband pipeline to rival gateways like America Online. The move
by the city's cable regulators recently prompted the telephone
company to file a lawsuit in federal court there.

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ As Alan Huang sees it, the key to the
Internet's future may lie in a simple card trick.
</P>
<P>
   In a restaurant here recently, Huang, a 50-year-old former Bell
Labs data network designer, used a new deck of playing cards to
help explain how an esoteric branch of mathematics known as group
theory offers a simple solution to the coming explosion of Internet
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   He separated the cards into three piles, then reassembled them
into a single deck, which he riffled with a flourish to show that
they were in seemingly random order. After several more times of
separating them into three piles and reassembling the deck, he
uttered, ``Abracadabra.'' As if by magic, the cards had been
reordered into the original sequence and suits of the new deck.
</P>
<P>
   Huang offered the card trick, well known among magicians as the
Grand Tour, as a simple demonstration of a type of mathematics
called group theory _ in which it is possible with a given set of
numbers to change their sequence and then reorder them by
repeatedly sorting them by using a specific mathematical function
known as a generator. But more to his business point, Huang
presents the card trick as a symbol for the new method _ an
efficient generator _ he says he has discovered for sorting out the
welter of data that often collides at the Internet's bottlenecks.
</P>
<P>
   Whether theory can translate to practice, though, remains a very
open question. Despite some impressive credentials in
computer-networking circles, so far he has found no backers and has
depleted most of his life savings in an effort to keep his
technological dream alive.
</P>
<P>
   If his technique does work, there would seem to be great demand
for it. Almost everyone agrees that greater Internet efficiency
will be crucial as vast new torrents of data pour onto the network
through new voice and video communications services. What is still
subject to debate is how best to accommodate this traffic. Industry
leaders like Cisco Systems Inc., the biggest maker of so-called
router hardware for directing network traffic, insist that the only
way to increase the current Internet's carrying capacity is to
build bigger, more expensive routers. But Huang, card deck and
group-theory mathematics in hand, contends that he has conceived a
novel way to string together the kind of less-expensive routers
already widely used on the Internet to expand its data-carrying
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, if the prevention of Internet traffic jams is as deft
as Huang's card trick suggests, why have no big companies or rich
investors been willing to give him table stakes?
</P>
<P>
   Deaf ears are hardly the reception that one might expect for a
researcher with Huang's credentials. As an AT&AMP;T Bell Laboratories
researcher in 1982, he was the co-inventor of a traffic-routing
approach to computer networks called Batcher Banyan switching, one
of the first prototype data networks intended to carry both voice
and video. For several years it held the world speed record for a
data network of its type.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1990, while still at Bell Labs, Huang grabbed national
attention when he led a research team that built the world's first
optical processor _ an information traffic controller for data
conveyed as laser light. Though the invention has yet to make its
way into a commercial product, many researchers still think that
optical switching will become an essential component for the data
networks of the future.
</P>
<P>
   But as Huang now seems to be finding the hard way, theoretical
research does not necessarily translate into the practical ideas
the investors and manufacturers are willing to bankroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at his idea and it was solid research,'' said Mike
Volpi, vice president of business development for Cisco Systems.
``But what is lacking is a practical implementation.'' In other
words: What may work in the ivory tower of academic research may
not prove viable in the chaotic real world of the Internet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Huang, the Bell Labs ivory tower was shaken by AT&AMP;T's
decision in 1995 to break into three companies and to split the
Bell Labs team between two of them _ the remaining AT&AMP;T
communications company and the new Lucent Technologies equipment
company. At the same time, Huang was hearing the Internet's
entrepreneurial siren song. And so in 1995 he headed back to
Silicon Valley, where he had been an electrical engineering
graduate student at Stanford University years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Huang set up a company, Terabit Routers, that initially pursued
the idea of building a super-router based on optical switching. But
after about a year, while reading the literature of group theory, a
branch of mathematics credited to Evariste Galois, the early
19th-century French mathematician, Huang had an epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe bigger and more complex was not the answer to Internet
routing. Maybe there was a way to draw upon the mathematics of
group theory and create the order from seeming chaos that might let
data networks operate much more efficiently _ so much so that
clusters of cheap, off-the-shelf routers could be harnessed into
acting as a new, faster, more powerful type of router.
</P>
<P>
   Since working his router ideas out on paper three years ago,
Huang has diligently solicited Silicon Valley's venture
capitalists, hoping to convince someone that his idea deserves
financing.
</P>
<P>
   But he is finding that esoteric and high-risk technology
concepts can be more difficult to sell to venture capitalists at a
time when simple, get-rich-quick ideas for Web commerce seem much
more in vogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to have mastered advanced physics, it's harder to
understand some technologies than the idea of selling wedding stuff
on line,'' said John Shoch, a venture capitalist at Asset
Management Corp. in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But Web wedding sites are not Huang's only obstacle. He contends
that his ideas also run counter to Silicon Valley's infatuation
with ``big iron'' _ ever more complex and powerful routers for
coping with the coming deluge of Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that this will accelerate the growth of the
Net dramatically,'' he said of his approach. ``But this is just
about math, and Silicon Valley is used to building faster chips.
It's not used to faster math.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Haung's so far disappointing search, his prospects have
begun to improve recently. Late last year he received a patent
covering his concept for hooking together computer routers, which
he refers to as a Galois network, in a tip of the hat to the French
pioneer of group theory.
</P>
<P>
   And lately, Huang has found interest and even enthusiasm in some
quarters of the industry. He said that British Telecommunications
was looking closely at his concept and was planning an experiment
to test his theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sat down with Alan in some fierce seminars,'' said Peter
Cochrane, head of research for British Telecom. ``The common sense
underlying his ideas kind of scream out at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Huang faces a daunting task in attempting to catch up
with the giant Cisco, which today makes the world's
highest-performance router, the GSR 12000. Moreover, there are
already three start-up companies _ Avici Systems, Nexabit Networks
Inc. and Pluris Inc. _ all shooting for the market for the next
wave of networking.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, being late isn't always a disadvantage, said Farrokh
Billimoria, a research analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San
Francisco who was co-author of a recent report on the future of the
routing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a unique idea and you start six months behind,
sometimes it's an advantage,'' he said. ``You can start behind and
catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely what Huang, shuffling his deck, is betting
on.

A RADICAL IDEA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lame as Sunday's Super Bowl was, the people who bought tickets
still couldn't have gotten a refund. Too bad the game wasn't
sponsored by Sierra Inc. of Bellevue, Wash. Sierra is a software
company that's busily making amends for its own lousy football
game, and providing an admirable new quality standard for the
entire industry.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, Sierra pulled thousands of copies of its
Football Pro 99 game from store shelves around the nation. No, the
program didn't contain a deadly computer virus. It didn't delete
vital operating system files by mistake, or make smoke come out of
your monitor. Football Pro 99 worked. It just wasn't very good.
</P>
<P>
   To Sierra executives, this was reason enough for a recall. In
addition, Sierra is doling out refunds and free goodies to unhappy
customers, and company president David Grenewetzki publicly
apologized for selling a product before its time. ``We let the
impending end of the football season influence our decision
process,'' said Grenewetzki. ``We figuratively dropped the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   This end-zone grovel is infinitely more attractive than the
preening and strutting we generally see in the computer industry,
so let's give Sierra high marks for doing the right thing. But
let's not forget to ask the obvious question: How does a bad piece
of software come to market in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   I asked Dan Rogers, who oversaw the Football Pro 99 project, and
who describes himself with pulse-quickening candor as ``the guy
that released that really crummy product.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it wasn't supposed to be crummy. The idea was to
create a game that would let hardcore fans simulate entire NFL
seasons, with the computer depicting the probable performances of
actual players and teams. Sort of like Microsoft Flight Simulator
with blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is that simulation games are murderously difficult to
create, and Sierra wanted this one on store shelves before the end
of the football season. People were putting in 120-hour weeks, said
Rogers. ``I had guys who were sleeping there. I was sleeping there.
I hadn't seen my wife in a month.''
</P>
<P>
   And it still wasn't enough. The only way to make the deadline
was to cut corners. ``You start talking to the quality-assurance
guys and inch by inch your quality seems to slip and you start
making compromises,'' said Rogers. ``You don't even realize you're
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The game wouldn't work properly with a number of those popular
three-dimensional graphics accelerator cards that gamers love.
Equally important, it just didn't simulate the NFL with sufficient
accuracy. Running backs didn't gain as much yardage as they should
have; quarterbacks didn't pass for the right number of yards. But
hey, it's a game. Who's going to know or care?
</P>
<P>
   The gamers, that's who. ``The user reactions from our fans was
immediately very bad,'' said Rogers. ``We just said, `My gosh, what
did we do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's more a question of what they didn't do. Software quality
experts say there are fundamental flaws in the way most programs
are designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can deliver much higher quality than they do today. Most
of them just don't understand how to do it,'' says John Pustaver,
president of Creative Data Systems in Sudbury, Mass. and an
experienced software tester. Pustaver said many software firms
neglect rigorous planning and testing, and instead just strive to
get the product out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bampos, vice president of software quality assurance at
Metamor Software Solutions in Newton, Mass., says the Internet has
made the problem worse, by allowing firms to rush bad products to
market and then post repair patches on line.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra, too, is offering a patch for Football Pro 99 users, but
the firm has gone much further. Customers can also get their money
back, plus a credit good for any $30 Sierra game. In addition, the
company created a Web site called Home Team where customers can
consult with Sierra developers about the design of Football Pro
2000, to make sure they get it right. ``We have been overwhelmed
with customer support,'' he said. Then again, Sierra may have
overwhelmed its customers by embracing the radical idea that
software shouldn't be sold until it works.

TRAVELING LITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By Simson L. Garfinkle   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although I do a fair amount of business-related traveling, a few
years ago I realized I was always leaving something important at
home. One time I was at a conference and wanted to get a file off
somebody's laptop, but I didn't have a floppy disk. Another time I
had gone away for a week, planning on getting a lot of writing
done, and discovered that I had left behind my laptop's power
supply.
</P>
<P>
   I dealt with my problem by creating a travel checklist. The list
has important things to bring, and things I should check the day
before I travel. When I remember to use it, my trips generally go
much better.
</P>
<P>
   Norton Mobile Essentials 1.0 from Symantec is supposed to
automate much of the same type of trip planning. Mobile Essentials
has three parts. The first part, ``Before You Go,'' is designed to
help you prepare your laptop and yourself for that business trip.
It tests your modem, runs SCANDISK on your computer's hard drive,
and checks for viruses. Next the program lets you make a backup
copy of your laptop's important files to a floppy or zip drive _
just in case something should go wrong. There's also a database of
important phone numbers, such as hotels, America Online dial-ups,
international phone numbers to report lost credit cards, and even a
traveler's checklist _ one that's remarkably similar to mine.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile Essentials also has a ``Location Controller,'' which is
supposed to reconfigure your laptop's Windows operating system for
different places. Norton will automatically change both your
clock's time and time zone (something that Windows should do, but
doesn't), remap your laptop's drives, configure printers, and so
on. Although this is a good concept, the execution needs more work.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Norton has created the ``Connection Doctor,'' which is
designed to diagnose common dial-up configuration problems.
Unfortunately, the Connection Doctor's main emphasis is hardware
problems: it won't diagnose problems caused by your Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with Mobile Essentials,
because it doesn't do what I need. My big problem these days isn't
configuring dial-ups, but file synchronization: I need some files
that are on my desktop, and others that are on the network. I solve
this problem by using the Windows 95 Briefcase. Before I leave, I
copy the directories that I'll need into the ``Briefcase.'' When I
travel I work out of the electronic briefcase. When I get back, I
use the Briefcase's ``update all'' feature to copy the modified
files back to my desktop computer's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   And Mobile Essentials also doesn't really explore a mobile
user's security needs. Virus checking and critical file backup is a
good start, but what laptop users really need is a program that
makes a complete copy of their laptop's hard drive, so if it gets
stolen they can get a replacement and restore all of the data and
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the program should encrypt all the data on the user's
hard drive, so that the stolen data won't be useful to anyone else.
One program that does just that is PGP Disk, by Network Associates.
It costs $39.95, and it's good insurance for any traveling
info-worker.
</P>
<P>
   Although it always helps to carry a floppy with your laptop,
floppy disks are becoming less useful all the time. The reason is
size: although computer hard disks have gone from 200 megabytes to
20 gigabytes over the past five years, the amount of data that you
can put on a 3.5-inch floppy has remained more or less the same.
Fortunately, high-speed network connections have made floppies
largely a thing of the past for desktop users. Now with a little
bit of work, you can make floppies largely irrelevant for laptops
as well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the easiest ways to get data from one laptop to another
is to beam it using infrared radiation. Practically every laptop
manufactured within the last three years has an infrared port;
Windows 98 makes it easy to use this port with ``Infrared
Recipient.''
</P>
<P>
   Infrared Recipient constantly monitors your laptop's infrared
port, sending out the name of the computer you are using and
looking for other notebook systems that are in range. When it sees
another computer, your laptop makes a funny little purring noise
and the name of the other machine appears inside the infrared
monitor window. Once the other computer shows up, you can send it a
file or a whole directory by simply dragging the file to the
infrared recipient folder. The files automatically get beamed
across the link and end up on the other computer in a directory
called ``My Received Files.''
</P>
<P>
   A much faster way to move files between two laptops is to use
Traveling Software's Laplink Professional and the company's new USB
Cable. The purple cable plugs into the USB ports of two laptops and
lets you send data much faster than over an infrared beam. Unlike
the Windows 98 built-in program, you can use Laplink Professional
to send files in both directions and browse the remote computer's
hard drive. Laplink Professional is also a remote access program:
you can use one laptop to control the second laptop over the USB
cable. Controlling a second machine over the USB cable is useful if
you are giving a presentation and there are too many people to fit
around one computer: just use a second laptop as a spare screen!
(Laplink Professional can also use the infrared port in the event
that you accidentally forget the cable at home.) Together, Laplink
Professional and the USB cable cost about $200.

FOX BRINGING BACK `90210' FOR 10TH SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Fear not, friends of the ZIP code gang. ``Beverly
Hills, 90210'' will still be around in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Already one of the longest-running prime-time dramas on
television, ``90210'' is set to go it at least one year longer.
Doug Herzog, Fox network's entertainment president, announced
Tuesday that the show has been renewed for a 10th season, with
episodes set to air through 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   ```Beverly Hills, 90210' is one of the most entertaining
ensemble dramas on television, and we're happy to be bringing it
back for a 10th season,'' said Herzog, who took over the helm at
Fox in January.
</P>
<P>
   The drama, which marked a comeback for Spelling Entertainment,
has followed a bunch of friends from their sophomore year in high
school into their 20s and adulthood. It originally focused on the
Walsh family _ Brandon (Jason Priestley), Brenda (Shannen Doherty),
Jim (James Eckhouse) and Cindy (Carol Potter) _ who moved from
Minnesota to the high-brow Los Angeles County neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, none of those characters remains. Priestley, who
was also an executive producer and directed several episodes, left
earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Remaining from the original ensemble are Kelly Taylor (Jennie
Garth), Donna Martin (Tori Spelling), David Silver (Brian Austin
Green) and Steve Sanders (Ian Ziering). Original character Dylan
McKay (Luke Perry) returned to the show this season.
</P>
<P>
   The show still wins its time slot in key demographic groups,
including adults ages 18 to 34; the show ranks seventh in prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   There had been talk that Spelling Entertainment would replace
the current ``90210'' and begin another generation of the show with
a new cast that would start out in high school.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came about a week after the network announced
that ``Melrose Place,'' another Spelling show on Fox, would not
return next season. Its final episode will air in May.

Microsoft Encarta African-- a distinguished addition to software
targeting African-Americans 
By Shelia M. Poole  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Walk the bustling streets of Timbuktu.
</P>
<P>
   Trace the trans-Atlantic slave routes and learn about customs
that survive today and can be traced directly to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the gravelly voice of Louis ``Satchmo'' Armstrong belt
out ``Back O' Town Blues'' during a 1965 performance.
</P>
<P>
   All with a mouse click.
</P>
<P>
   Those and other features are now available on Microsoft Encarta
Africana software, which was released on the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr.'s birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tree needs plants to grow, and we need a sense of who we
are,'' said G. Ewa Ealy, co-manager and special events coordinator
for the Shrine of the Black Madonna bookstore in Atlanta who plans
to carry the product. ``I don't think you can underestimate the
potential this product has to our community and to our world.''
</P>
<P>
   Encarata Africana, which sells for $70, offers a groundbreaking,
comprehensive encyclopedia of Africans and people of African
descent throughout the world _ from the shores of Africa to the
United States, the Caribbean, South America and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was the brainchild of Dr. Louis Henry Gates Jr., noted
author and chairman of the Afro-American Studies department at
Harvard University, and Dr. Kwame Anthony Appiah, professor of
Afro-American Studies and Philosophy at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The two made a pact 25 years ago that they would bring the dream
of W.E.B. DuBois, a leading African-American scholar of the 20th
century, to produce a comprehensive encyclopedia of Africana.
</P>
<P>
   The first companies they approached about the project _ then as
a book _ were lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   They were told by one company it was ``not economically viable''
and were asked if Gates could possibly raise $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   They struck gold, however, when an executive at Random House
suggested doing the project on CD-ROM. With financial backing from
the likes of composer Quincy Jones and others, they came up with a
prototype. But even with a good prototype, they continued to hit
snags.
</P>
<P>
   Once, they were told the timing was off and that it might work
better as a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have cried,'' said co-editor Gates. ``They all said,
`Great project, but its not commercially viable.'''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Microsoft. The parties got together, and soon plans were
made to launch Encarta Africana.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing quite like this out there,'' said Gates, who
said the editors and publishers are making a concerted effort to
reach schools, churches and universities. ``This is the whole black
world. This is the bottom line. We want to make the African and
African-American experience a fundamental part of the fabric of
culture itself, of knowledge itself and of education itself. Not
just something that is done in the coldest, darkest, dampest month
of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   He said talks are under way about a second version, which will
be ``bigger and badder'' than the first.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the attention has been focused on Encarta
Africana, other software titles are available that either target
African-Americans or address some aspect of African-American
culture and history.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Learning Co. last summer published Essence
Virtual Makeover, beauty software created specifically for
African-American women. The software, created in conjunction with
Essence magazine, has gotten off to a good start. Learning
officials say it is the seventh-best-selling product in its
category, personal improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Users load a photo into their computer and within minutes can
try out hundreds of different hairstyles, hair colors, cosmetics
and contact lenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has done pretty well considering it has a smaller
demographic target than a lot of our software,'' said Pamela Sooge,
vice president of lifestyles. ``We estimate that 2 million
African-American women use computers at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The project made sense, Sooge said, considering on average
African-American women spend more on hair care and cosmetics than
their white counterparts. But that was not being addressed in
previous computer makeover products. African-American women found a
very limited number of styles that would fit them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issue really comes down to PC penetration and
purchasing behavior, and that will grow obviously as there are more
computers in those households,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other programs available include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Black Wings: The program chronicles African-Americans in
aviation. Black Wings is a joint project of the National Aerospace
Museum and Fairfax, Va.-based SSB Inc. It was released in 1996 and
includes interviews with many of the original Tuskegee airmen and
information on aviators in the Korean and Vietnam wars, then takes
users into the space age. $39.99
</P>
<P>
   _ Clip Art With Color Volumes I-IV: Published by Gikuuri
Software, this series contains more than 300 color images of
African-Americans in different settings. The images can be used in
newsletters, invitations and brochures. $29.99-$49.99
</P>
<P>
   _ Encyclopedia Britannica Profiles Black History: This software
program answers such questions as what was the Dred Scott decision?
When were the Fugitive Slave Acts passed? This interactive program
contains time lines, more than 500 articles, 275 photographs and
audio and video clips. $29.99
</P>
<P>
   While these and other black-oriented software programs have
gotten a thumbs up from many, others bemoan the dearth of computer
products that specifically target African-Americans or that include
African-Americans in prominent roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably an issue of critical mass,'' said Patrick
McElroy, president of the Freedom Group, an Atlanta-based Internet
consulting firm and owner of EverythingBlack.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a company with $20 million in overhead a year, it's
probably not worth your while to do Afrocentric software
exclusively. But if you're a one- or two-person shop, obviously you
can make enough money to pay expenses and have some extra.
Oftentimes we are underserved because we are waiting for some big
corporation to satisfy a niche when perhaps a niche player should
come in and take care of that need.''

   IMPEACH _ WASHINGTON _ Senators hope to wrap up today (Thursday)
the only impeachment trial of this century. Yesterday Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott said that ``if at all possible'' he
would like to set a vote for 5 p.m. EST Thursday on whether to
convict Clinton on the perjury and obstruction of justice charges _
votes that by all signs will fall far short of the two-thirds
majority needed to oust the nation's 42nd president. Sen . Paul
Coverdell asked if Senators could submit their statements without
reading them, which could speed up the deliberation process.

`STAR WARS' PREQUEL BRINGS `FANBOYS' OUT IN FULL FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PATTI HARTIGAN   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They may live in a parallel universe, but they're fun-loving
sorts, peaceful fellows. They fantasize about alien adventures, but
they're really quite down-to-earth. So one of them goes over to the
Dark Side every now and then, wearing his Vader regalia in public.
What of it? So another chap wants to play his favorite movie in the
delivery room when his wife gives birth to their first _ as yet
unconceived _ child. No big deal.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about the ``fanboys,'' the closely knit group of
``Star Wars'' fanatics who spend hours and hours scouring the globe
for tidbits about the upcoming ``prequel'' to the George Lucas
adventure series, which will be released May 21. They're obsessive,
they're tenacious, they're devoted to the cause. And, to say the
least, these fanboys are wired.
</P>
<P>
   They seem to soak up radiation from their computer screens the
way certain sun worshippers lap up ultraviolet rays. Consider: Late
one evening, a mainstream reporter sent e-mail to one of the most
popular sites, www.theforce.net. Within a few minutes, two Web
masters called back, and within five minutes, four messages popped
in from four states. Let the force be with you? The force is
everywhere, just waiting to strike back.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the trailer for the prequel hit movie screens in
November, the ``Star Wars'' Web sites have been rushed with the
kind of urgent traffic you might expect from crowds racing to
catch, say, the last flight out of Saigon. There are thousands of
unofficial fan sites, and a half-dozen of them receive more than
15,000 hits a day. Every day, these sites post new tidbits about
the prequel and the Skywalk convention in Dallas that will coincide
with the release of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lets me nurture my obsession,'' says Brian Linder, a
23-year-old network systems engineer and a Forcenet driving force
from Columbia, S.C., who wins the award for the fastest fanboy to
respond to e-mail. Linder, like most of the other Jedi junkies, was
fascinated by the series as a child, attracted by the
``multicultural, multinational'' cast of characters and by the
Joseph Campbell-style mythological themes. Sure, some of his
friends think he's a bit out there. He dragged his girlfriend to
see the trailer four times, but she's learned to understand. ``But
my roommate likes to bust my chops,'' he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Lou ``T-Bone'' Tambone, a Web master for www.starwarz.com who
lives in Watertown, has a sympathetic spouse: They got married on
May 25, 1997, the 20th anniversary of the release of the first
``Star Wars'' film. Their wedding cake was graced with Han Solo and
Leia figurines, and they marched into their reception to the
adventurous strains of the John Williams theme.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of these networked fans, Tambone, 28, has a sense of
humor about the current craze. ``Some guys think it's their
responsibility to inform the world about every little thing that
every `Star Wars' person does, like `Jake Lloyd (the 8-year-old boy
who plays young Darth Vader in the prequel) scratched his head
today,' '' he says. ``OK, that's obsessive.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, it sure is. The Web world is populated by fanatics. A
Catholic priest in the Netherlands, one Roderick Vonhogen, has put
together a detailed plot synopsis of the prequel, his fellow
fanboys say. John Benson, a Forcenet fanboy who works for IBM in
Atlanta and who can recite android trivia like a missionary quoting
scripture, spent $1,200 on a Darth Vader costume. He and his wife,
Georgie, are planning to have children and he is trying to persuade
her to let him watch the films _ ``or at least play the music'' _
in the delivery room.
</P>
<P>
   The fans are linked together electronically, but their obsession
can be a hindrance to close encounters in the flesh world. ``I'm
not married, and I'm not sure it's been helping my social life,''
says Forcenet staffer Steve Head, a Weymouth resident who works for
a South Shore real estate firm. Given the ratio of 20 fanboys to
every fangirl, it seems as if someone should come up with a
Starmate service, an electronic dating venture of the intergalactic
kind.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Internet fan groups, these folks are not
competitive or cutthroat about their endeavors, and for the most
part, Lucasfilms hasn't struck back at the fans for posting images
and inside information. (The production company has issued a few
cease-and-desist orders to sites that sell ``Star Wars''
memorabilia, but they'd be crazy to alienate their alien-obsessed
fans.) There is a peaceful, almost childlike quality about them,
which is perhaps what the whole thing is all about. It's about
escape, entering a universe where good conquers evil and the heroes
get the best costumes. ``I'm a Han Solo guy: He has that cool vest
thing going,'' says Tambone about the character immortalized by
Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fanboys pause and search for words when asked to
define the appeal, to explain why they spend up to 50 hours a week
on line updating their sites. But Tambone cuts to the chase. ``When
I was 7, my parents were going to get divorced,'' he recalls
wistfully, sounding a bit like Princess Leia in the 1977 classic.
Obi Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope. ``When you're little, your
parents try to keep it from you, but I needed a place to keep the
pain away. `Star Wars' was in full force, and it became a safe
place, a hideaway. I grew attached to it. It distracted me from the
real world.''

APPLE AIMS FOR BUSINESS NICHE WITH NEW GE SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By WENDY TANAKA   
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Apple Computer Inc's powerful new G3 computers
represent a crucial step for the company into the arena of business
computing.
</P>
<P>
   The G3 design has the same unconventional look as Apple's
enormously popular iMac. But that's where the similarity between
the two computers stops.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac is designed for the home and sells for about $1,200.
The new G3 is aimed at design professionals and ranges in price
from $1,600 to $3,000. It is a much faster version of Apple's
original G3, introduced in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The G3 has up to a gigabyte of memory and 100 gb of internal
disk storage. It also has processor speeds of up to 400 megahertz
and a built-in, high-performance ATI RAGE 128 graphics card. The
G3's minitower flips open so users can add memory, storage or PCI
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Apple said Web site designers, publishing houses, schools and
video editing companies will be some of the main G3 customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a loyal following, and this machine is exactly what
they've been looking for,'' Apple spokesman Russell Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the iMac have exceeded industry projections. Since its
launch in August, 800,000 iMacs have been sold _ about 300,000 more
than analysts had projected. And Apple just introduced a newer
version of the iMac, offering slightly more speed and a new array
of colors.
</P>
<P>
   Brady said figures for the new G3, introduced last month,
wouldn't be available until April, when Apple's first-quarter
results are posted.
</P>
<P>
   Technology analysts predicted that the G3 would not be a
barn-burner product like the iMac because Apple missed the boat
several years ago and didn't expand its base of business customers.
As a result, Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating platform
swooped in and has become the dominant business desktop workstation
for producing graphics and three-dimensional visuals.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Specker, an analyst in Soundview Technology Group Inc.'s
San Francisco office, said Apple's failure to penetrate the
business market stems from the ``fundamentally poor decision'' by
former Apple chief executive John Sculley to not license Apple
technology to other vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Dataquest Inc. of San Jose, Calif., estimated about 63 million
Windows NT operating units will be sold in 2001. That is roughly
nine times more than the 7 million NT computers sold in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Brady said 1.6 million older Apple G3 units were sold, and he
said the newer series offers heftier sales potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at the high end of Web design and graphics will be
doing back flips over the G3. It's a great install-based extension,
but it won't do anything to get into Microsoft's space,'' said John
Oltsik, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc., a market research
firm in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Apple die-hards are most likely to purchase the new G3, Specker
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The G3 target market is people with a lot of money who like
Apples,'' he said. ``That's a substantive revenue opportunity.''

 Welcome to the Net's Little Shop of Horrors  
 By Jamie Beckett   
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most online shoppers don't have a pressing need for green
fluorescent protein, nucleic acid or moose intestine.
</P>
<P>
   But just in case, there's Chemdex. The Palo Alto startup has
opened an online store where scientists can buy these and thousands
of other biochemical substances from dozens of different
manufacturers. Although small, this nascent Web marketplace is one
sign of a dramatic shift in how businesses purchase goods.
</P>
<P>
   While Amazon.com, eBay and other online retailers that sell to
consumers have grabbed all the attention, Internet buying by
businesses has been growing _ fast. Last year, business-to-business
e-commerce reached $43 billion, nearly 10 times consumer online
spending, according to Forrester Research. The Cambridge, Mass.,
research firm expects that to soar to $1.3 trillion in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that commerce comes from companies such as networking
firm 3Com or PC supplier Dell. But a whole new breed of online
merchant is opening up shop, representing not just one manufacturer
but dozens in one industry, selling plastic or metal or fabric or
even intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   ``These middlemen help buyers do comparison shopping,'' said
Chuck Shih, research director for Electronic Commerce at Gartner
Group. ``They're just exploding now. It's a model of commerce that
lends itself to the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Chemdex, most researchers purchased materials for their
experiments from catalogs. These catalogs are a far cry from Land's
End or J. Crew. They're dense volumes of mostly text and as thick
as telephone books. Although a few manufacturers had their own Web
sites, there was no Chemdex-style supermarket for researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Customers include cancer researchers, cell biologists,
neuroscientists and biochemists _ both individual researchers and
those who work at large companies. They're ordering biochemicals
used in scientific research such as antibodies, proteins and
enzymes.
</P>
<P>
   On average, a research scientist might spend five hours a week
flipping through 40 or 50 catalogs, scribbling product numbers and
prices on scraps of paper. The scientist or an administrator would
then transfer that information to a purchase order form _ one form
for each manufacturer. Orders may then have to be approved by
several people before they get sent to the supplier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's enormously inefficient,'' said David Perry, co-founder of
Chemdex (www.chemdex.com). While a student at Harvard Business
School, Perry helped start a small biotech company and saw
firsthand how much effort researchers put into simply ordering
materials. ``I figured there had to be a better way.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry and Jeffrey Leane, Chemdex's chief technology officer
founded the company 15 months ago. It now offers more than 150,000
products from 60 manufacturers. The online ordering system works
this way: buyers who sign up for the service search the database
for the products they need. Each search returns a list of suppliers
and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Say, you need some DMEM, which is a sort of food for cells. A
search turns up 13 items _ different types of DMEM, different
quantities and prices and, in this case, one supplier. The
researcher clicks on the desired items. The information's entered
onto an order form comparable to the online shopping baskets
e-retail sites use. When the order is complete, the researcher
clicks to purchase. If the order requires spending approvals, it
will go to the appropriate corporate officials, then to the
supplier.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Chemdex's biggest customer is Genentech, the South San
Francisco biotech giant. Most of its other customers are smaller
companies like Eos Biotechnology, a South San Francisco startup
doing DNA research. Privately held Chemdex doesn't disclose
revenues but says between 50 and 100 researchers sign up every day.
</P>
<P>
   Before signing up for Chemdex, scientist Kim Ha of Eos was
trying to juggle two jobs: handling purchasing for her lab while
still carving out time to conduct genetic research.`I'd spend an
hour or two every day taking care of purchasing. So then I'd be
working 10 to 12 hours a day just so I'd have time for my
research,'' she said. Now, the lab's scientists can place most of
their own orders. Not only does it make Ha's job easier, but
there's less chance of error and researchers are able to track
their own orders directly. Accounting is happy, too, Ha said, it is
easier to track of what is ordered and how much is spent.
</P>
<P>
   Perry and Leane weren't the only ones to spot opportunity in
providing online ordering for the $10 billion scientific materials
marketplace. SciQuest, a North Carolina startup, began offering an
online database of scientific materials in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   SciQuest is aiming at a slightly broader market. In addition to
the substances Chemdex offers, the companysells testing materials
for industrial markets and scientific equipment. It also offers
www.labdeal.com, an online clearance center for surplus lab
supplies. The main site, www.sciquest.com, will be capable of
handling transactions by April, but a beta version is being used by
a few customers now. Last year, SciQuest had $1.5 million cq in
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Campbell, electronic commerce project manager for
pharmaceutical giant Hoffman-La Roche, said her company is moving
to online ordering _ and it's already made the process more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first big difference is the online catalog is more current
than the paper one,'' Campbell said. ``If you use a paper catalog,
sometimes you have an old part number, sometimes a page is ripped
out. It doesn't show prices your company may have negotiated with
the supplier. I have to search one (paper) catalog at a time, and
I'll have catalogs open all over my desk.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the beginning. Online ordering cuts out some
stops along the ordering process where things can go wrong. An
administrator may enter the wrong product number. The order could
get lost on the way to the vendor. The vendor may not have all of
the materials and hold the order for full shipment. Or the vendor
could send the order and it gets lost in shipping. And lots, lots
more.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman La Roche's electronic ordering system includes data on
what each scientist can spend and it automatically routes orders to
the right person for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Varda Lief, an analyst at Forrester Research, said she doesn't
expect SciQuest and Chemdex to face many competitors because the
cost and complexity of setting up a site that is so technical is
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly a niche market, but one where there will be
considerable growth,'' she said. She estimates the overall market
for online pharmaceutical and medical supplies will be $1.4 billion
this year and $44 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about efficiency,'' said Martha Greer, vice president
of marketing at Chemdex. ``If scientists save time (ordering) they
have more time at the research bench to discover something of use
to the world.''

WEB SITE TO FEATURE STORIES FROM PIONEERING BLACK JOURNALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ When friends talk about Earl Caldwell, they
use phrases such as ``steel in his constitution'' to describe his
dead-on aim to succeed against any odds _ and then they mention the
honey-dripping charm that he emits.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom has so much happened to one black journalist. He's
nothing if not a storyteller _ and he has tales to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell, the writer-in-residence at the Robert C. Maynard
Institute for Journalism Education in Oakland, will share his and
other black journalists' stories about the early days of newspaper
integration in serial narratives that will run on the Maynard
Institute Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some time, we have wanted to do more work on the history
of journalists of color,'' said Stephen Montiel, president of the
Maynard Institute. ``So many younger journalists weren't aware of
who came before them. We also wanted to do more on Bob's life as a
journalist. ... There's no journalist better to do that than Earl
Caldwell through his life experience and his relationship with Bob
Maynard.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those stories destined for the Web site
(www.maynardije.org) will include newspaper clippings of Maynard,
the late Oakland Tribune owner and first black publisher of a major
metropolitan newspaper in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to present a clear, sharp picture of Maynard, try to
archive black journalists, re-create that period, what we struggled
with, what we started,'' said Caldwell, 60. ``Bob Maynard was one
of the great journalists of his era.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell's friendship with Maynard began in 1961, when they were
the only black reporters at two Pennsylvania newspapers, Maynard in
York and Caldwell in Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a guy (Maynard) from New York City who wanted to be a
journalist and couldn't get a job in his own hometown _ not because
he wasn't good enough but because he's too black,'' Caldwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell, a former New York Times reporter and New York Daily
News columnist, has had quite a career himself.
</P>
<P>
   Like who really killed the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.? It
wasn't James Earl Ray, Caldwell says. He was a witness to the
shooting and saw a man crouched in nearby bushes. Whatever happened
to him?
</P>
<P>
   Like refusing to be a spy for the FBI or turn over notes to an
organization that Americans later learned was setting up the Black
Panthers. Yes, Caldwell was in the midst of that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell began working on mainstream newspapers in the early
1960s, one of a handful of black reporters at daily papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a guy who bridged an era,'' said longtime friend Leroy
Aarons, former executive editor of the Oakland Tribune and founder
of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a guy who wanted to make it in the newspaper
business,'' Aarons said. ``He was obsessed with newspapers. But he
was coming up against a hostile environment for people of color.
Right away, here's somebody with a tremendous amount of steel in
his constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell had to walk the fine line of black reporter on a white
newspaper and black man in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sooner had he landed,'' recalled Aarons, than the civil
rights movement exploded. ``Earl was thrown in the middle. Here you
are trying to survive and prove you're just as good as anyone with
a Caucasian background, and suddenly you're faced with an explosive
and divisive social change in which you have to reconcile your
professional and personal ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   For Caldwell, who had grown up in the nearly all-white town of
Clearfield, Pa., the experience was educational.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think of myself as black,'' Caldwell said.
</P>
<P>
   But as rioting erupted in cities across the nation, and the
black community demanded ``white reporters out,'' reporters such as
Caldwell and Maynard were sought after to go places where white
reporters were not welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacks at the bottom said, `White reporters out.' That's what
opened the door (for newspaper integration). Editors had to give
the blacks jobs,'' Caldwell said. ``Diversity in the newsroom
didn't start because some editors decided it. The community rioted,
and their reporters couldn't cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At papers where there were no African-Americans, news executives
sent the first black person they encountered _ be he janitor,
messenger or artist _ to the scene of trouble to report back to
white rewrite men, Caldwell said.
</P>
<P>
   When Caldwell joined the New York Times and was dispatched to
San Francisco to cover the Black Panthers, the FBI decided it
wanted Caldwell to be an informant.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some satisfaction in being tested, and meeting the
test,'' Caldwell said. ``All of these stories have to be told. The
Internet is a great vehicle to tell them. There's an urgency to
tell them. My hair has turned white.''

DEALS TO CASH IN ON INTERNET TAKE MANY FORMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet's best-known companies are all jockeying for
greater influence and bigger audiences. But they're all doing it in
different ways.
</P>
<P>
   Internet legend Netscape Communications Corp. surrendered to the
overwhelming power of rival Microsoft Corp., and is selling out to
America Online Inc. The Snap and Infoseek Internet services are
teaming up with traditional media companies in a bid for greater
visibility. Lycos Inc. of Waltham, Mass. is joining with USA
Networks Inc. to establish a new electronic commerce empire. And
the most famous of the lot, Yahoo Inc., stands in proud isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Given Tuesday's brutal sell-off in Internet stocks, investors
are clearly having their doubts about the high market valuations of
many Internet companies. Some industry watchers think the Lycos-USA
Networks deal, announced Tuesday, carried a low premium that is
making many people rethink Internet stocks in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it gives investors a very clear look at how high the
Internet valuations are,'' said Frank Gens, Internet analyst with
International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But with 70 million North Americans on line, rich rewards await
companies that do the best job of reaching the Internet audience.
The question is how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   One popular approach is alliance with a traditional broadcast
media company. The logic is simple enough, according to Melissa
Bane, analyst for the Yankee Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 75 percent of the US population not on the Web, you have
to consider where your new customers are going to
</P>
<P>
   see your brand,'' Bane said. ``It won't be on the Web. They're
not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   To reach these unwired consumers, portals are doing deals with
big media companies. That's part of the rationale behind CNet
Inc.'s decision to team up with NBC to promote CNet's Snap Internet
service. NBC has spent millions advertising Snap during its
prime-time programs.
</P>
<P>
   A similar promotional strategy is being pursued by the Walt
Disney Co., which acquired a 43 percent stake in the Infoseek
Internet service last summer at a bargain-basement price of $70
million. Disney already has a stable of well-known Internet sites
for its ABC and ESPN television networks, and Disney-branded sites
for children and families. The company has woven these properties
together with Infoseek's Web searching features to create its own
Internet brand, the Go Network.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Group's Bane says the prospects for Go Network have been
``extremely underestimated,'' noting that Disney's vast market
reach could catapult the firm to the top tier of Web sites.
``They're putting their money where their mouth is in promoting
that brand.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gens of IDC isn't impressed by Go Network's present lineup:
``I don't really see anything all that unique in the Go Network
that would label it as a breakthrough bridging of the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, America Online Inc., the world's top provider of
Internet access to consumers, can afford to follow a different
business model. Unlike the Web portals, AOL has 16 million paying
customers, and earned $92 million in profit last year on revenues
of $2.6 billion. AOL is already the best-known name on the
Internet, and its Web site is the most-visited.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL is determined to reach beyond its paying customers to
the Internet at large. That's a big reason behind AOL's agreement
last November to buy Netscape Communications Corp. for $4.2
billion. Netscape not only brought along its strong Internet
software know-how, but also its Netcenter Internet portal, one of
the 10 most popular sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netscape is very popular in business, and AOL is not,'' said
Peggy O'Neill, Internet analyst at Dataquest Inc. in San Jose,
Calif. ``The people who use Netscape tend not to be the people who
use AOL.'' By buying Netscape, AOL gets access to both these large
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial of the recent deals came last month, when
At Home, a firm that provides high-speed Internet access over cable
TV systems, agreed to pay $6.7 billion in stock for the Excite
Internet portal. The money-losing Excite went for nearly double its
already high market capitalization to At Home, a company that
presently has a mere 330,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that At Home is destined to become much bigger as
more and more consumers are able to receive high-speed cable
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   But IDC's Gens is skeptical. ``We're not very bullish on the At
Home-Excite deal. It's all potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yahoo, a company almost synonymous with the Internet,
is preserving its independence. It's moving to expand its outreach
by acquiring the GeoCities service for creating free Web pages. But
Yahoo president and chief operating officer Jeff Mallett says Yahoo
is big enough and rich enough to prosper on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're staying with our strategy,'' Mallett said. ``Our goal is
to have the broadest and best services once you get to the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike USA/Lycos and other Web portals, Yahoo has no plans to
sell goods to its customers. Yahoo operates an on-line retailing
and auction service where other businesses can sell their wares.
Companies pay Yahoo for the right to sell products there, and
Mallett said his firm won't turn around and compete with its
business clients. ``It's never been our objective to do that,'' he
said.

MICROSOFT INTRODUCING WOMEN.COM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Microsoft Corp. is set to introduce a new Web site for women
on Monday, hoping to capture what many feel is the largest and
fastest-growing market on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Called Women Central, the site will feature content from
Women.com, the largest online publisher of women's material, as
well as original material, including Microsoft's own Underwire
online magazine. The company has signed the Unilever Corp. as the
site's primary sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The new site will be a channel on Microsoft's revamped MSN
network, the fledgling Web site that started out as its own online
service three years ago and has since undergone several
transformations. Microsoft would not disclose how much it was
spending on the new site.
</P>
<P>
   With Women Central, Microsoft is hoping to tap into what Jupiter
Communications, a new-media research company, calls the
fastest-growing audience on the Web, a market expected to grow to
65 million in 2002 from 45 million today. Last year, according to
Jupiter, 55 percent of newcomers to the Internet were women, up
from 50 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   In designing the new site, Microsoft hopes to help women do what
they do best on line: stay put, said Michael Goff, MSN's director
of programming. Men tend to surf the Web and jump from site to
site, Goff said, but women are more likely to visit fewer sites to
complete specific tasks, such as join online discussion groups,
find specific information or buy something.
</P>
<P>
   Like most content sites these days, Microsoft is hoping Women
Central will become a so-called portal site for women, where they
can find most of what they want on the Web, including shopping and
online discussions.
</P>
<P>
   But while women may represent the fastest-growing segment on the
Web, the market already is crowded, and whether the company will
find the right formula is anybody's guess. In November, NBC bought
a stake in iVillage, another site aimed at women. Two weeks ago,
the Hearst Corp. announced a joint venture with Women.com to create
a mega-site for women. Through the deal, Women.com gained
distribution rights for Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping and
Hearst's other women's magazines.

THE TRAVELER'S CYBER-COMPANION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Johan Reinhard called a friend in Texas recently to chat
from near the top of the world. A high-altitude anthropologist
whose explorations in the Andes and Himalayas often appear in
National Geographic, Reinhard was standing at the summit of a
20,000-foot mountain in Peru, using a new kind of telephone that
beams conversation from virtually anywhere on earth to a
constellation of low-orbit satellites and back down to terrestrial
wired and wireless phone networks.
</P>
<P>
   Had he wished to (and had he the stamina to carry all the gear
up the mountain), he could have snapped a picture of himself with a
digital camera, attached it to a lightweight portable computer, and
sent the image halfway across the planet as electronic mail via
satellite phone over the Internet _ an instant, electronic postcard
from the new era of travel.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is transforming travel not just for explorers in
remote corners of the world, but also for families packing the
minivan for a drive to Grandma's house, and for the travel industry
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Technically savvy consumers have been able to research travel
destinations and make airline reservations from home for more than
a decade using personal computers and early online information
services such as Compuserve. But since the mid-1990s, declining
computer prices and the rapid growth of the Internet have caused an
almost unimaginable proliferation of online travel information
sites and services, all available from the comfort of home.
</P>
<P>
   Computer chips allow people to research trips, shop for the
lowest fares, reserve airline tickets, look inside hotel rooms from
thousands of miles away, get detailed maps, check train schedules,
chat electronically with other travelers familiar with the
destination, order travel guides, create custom itineraries, buy
luggage, watch video travelogues on a VCR, check detailed weather
reports, compare exchange rates, research restaurants, peer through
remote cameras to see what the weather is like right now in Seattle
or Antarctica, study a foreign language and book tickets to local
cultural and sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a trip never sounded so exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   Like the telegraph and telephone before it, the Internet was
supposed to reduce the need to travel. As technology makes the
world a smaller place, people are traveling more, not less. This is
partly because technology makes travel more convenient, but also
because it stirs the user's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important difference about cyberspace is that there
is no distance between two points,'' said Paul Saffo, a director at
the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park, Calif. ``The Internet
gives people these marvelous electronic seven-league boots that can
drop them into Katmandu, and once they visit Katmandu
electronically, it is going to make them curious. When people visit
somewhere electronically, they want to go there on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The travel industry is helping to push consumers toward
computers and Internet services. Last month, Delta Air Lines
imposed a $2 round-trip surcharge on domestic tickets not purchased
through its Web site. (The surcharge, sharply criticized by travel
agents, was withdrawn two weeks later.)
</P>
<P>
   In a slight variation, American Airlines, to name one,
occasionally gives discounts on tickets purchased via computer.
Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air recently imposed a $10 surcharge
for mailing paper tickets. Other airlines have been studying
similar inducements, to the consternation of travel agents and some
travelers without Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines contend that the shift to Internet reservations and
ticketing will help them cut costs by reducing staff and increasing
productivity, although such pronouncements often do not mention the
need to hire more highly paid programmers and Web designers.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet offers the airlines, which have been cutting
commissions to travel agents in recent years, a way to further
reduce commissions and the cost of distributing tickets. In any
event, Delta announced record profits the week after imposing the
surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom one asks and how one counts, travel is the
biggest, or one of the biggest, categories of spending by online
consumers. Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., estimates that
total spending for online travel bookings last year, counting
airlines, hotels, rental cars, tours and cruises, was $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of future bookings vary, but Fiona Swerdlow, a digital
commerce analyst at Jupiter Communications in New York, said the
research company predicted in April that online leisure travel
spending by consumers would rocket to $11.7 billion by the year
2002.
</P>
<P>
   The figure does not include business travel booked through
corporate travel agencies, and the increased presence of cruise and
tour companies offering bookings on the Web recently may make the
total even higher, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Travel-specific sites on the World Wide Web are reporting surges
of visitors, as consumers become more comfortable researching
trips, buying tickets and reserving rooms on line. According to NPD
Online Research, a division of NPD Group in Port Washington, N.Y.,
nearly 70 percent of Web users _ and there are more than 70 million
in America alone, according to some studies _ say they have visited
a travel-related site at some time. Among computer users who travel
frequently, the Web is already as indispensable as a suitcase and a
toothbrush.
</P>
<P>
   One site, Travelocity (www.travelocity.com), reports that it has
more than five million registered users. Preview Travel
(www.previewtravel.com) claims six million. Microsoft's Expedia
(www.expedia.msn.com), which recently reported more than $10
million in weekly travel sales _ car, air and hotel only _ claims
more than four million registered users in the United States and
Canada. America Online, with more than 15 million subscribers, is
adding a new section for business travelers later this month.
Leisure travel is already one of the most popular topics among
AOL's subscribers, said Pam McGraw, a company spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of smaller Internet sites and online
information services. Many of them are maintained as hobbies or
public services by travel enthusiasts, but in the past two years
corporate behemoths have been willing to spend tens of millions of
dollars on elaborate sites and E-commerce systems in the belief
that profits will eventually accrue. So far, spending is still
outpacing revenue, services like Expedia and Travelocity say.
</P>
<P>
   The allure of such sites is that they give the traveler direct
access to the same information available to travel agents. Like
most travel agencies, these online services are free _ other than
the cost of the Internet connection. While it is true that the
personal relationship with a travel agent is lost, there are other
compensations.
</P>
<P>
   Some automated systems today can notify travelers by pager the
minute a flight schedule or gate is changed, or by electronic mail
when special fares appear for favorite airline routes. A Web-savvy
younger generation and others who have embraced the new technology
relish fending for themselves. As a result, some analysts
anticipate that the traditional travel agency will eventually
become an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Smart virtual agents, perhaps overseen by smart human travel
agents, will someday roam the Internet armed with a dossier of a
client's personal and price preferences, said Andrew B. Whinston, a
professor of information systems at the University of Texas at
Austin, whose expertise is electronic commerce. The software
agents, Whinston said, could quickly construct a comprehensive and
complex itinerary of air tickets, hotels, rental cars, restaurant
reservations, theater tickets, shopping discounts, sightseeing
schedules, reading lists, baby-sitting services, and so on _ all
for a predetermined budget.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has been trapped in an endless loop of a voice mail
system, trying to connect with a human, knows that technology often
does not work as well as it could, and could definitely be made
easier. The Web is no different.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate NPD survey, conducted in October with five major
airlines, only 18 percent of the airline site visitors polled said
they could always find the information they sought.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and other major travel site operators are scrambling
to make their services more convenient, by reducing the number of
mouse clicks needed to get a fare quote, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Computerized baggage handling, ticket-taking and freight-routing
systems installed at some new airports (Denver, Hong Kong) and
train stations (Berlin) in recent years have caused more delays
initially than they have prevented. Car-based navigation and
mapping systems occasionally lead drivers into dead ends, or, in
the case of an unfortunate German couple traveling in a rental car
at night, to bridges that are not there. (They got wet.)
</P>
<P>
   On general Internet sites like America Online or Yahoo, clicking
on the ``travel'' button on screen will present the user with
hundreds of topics, often organized into specific groups and
sometimes focused with astonishing specificity: travel information
for seniors, for backpackers, for motorcyclists and so on.
</P>
<P>
   On a site maintained by the travel book publisher Rough Guides
(www.roughguides.com), a recent topic was proper etiquette for
being thrashed with twigs by friendly strangers in a Finnish sauna
_ not the typical information one would get from a local travel
agent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the sites offer chat services and bulletin boards. Chat
services allow the user to converse on screen with one or more
people, anywhere in the world, at the same time. Bulletin boards
are used to post questions or comments that others can read and
respond to at any time.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the commentary is banal, but occasionally the exchanges
yield valuable, first-hand (if unsubstantiated) information _ avoid
hotel X, don't miss restaurant Y, and Z is the cheapest place to
rent gear. It is not unheard of for people to forge friendships in
such forums.
</P>
<P>
   Although fax machines still appear to be more popular in some
parts of the world _ typically where the postal systems are
unreliable _ the Internet is invaluable for making reservations.
Electronic mail is not a slave to time zones, and in preparing for
a recent trip to Italy I discovered that my fractured Italian
translated better in electronic mail than it did over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the Internet surprises even technology aficionados
like me. A small hotel where I vacationed in the remote Cinque
Terre region of Italy, a place largely inaccessible by automobile,
not only has Internet access but also its own Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Once in my room, however, I also discovered that while the hotel
staff might have e-mail, the concept of allowing guests to have
access to personal e-mail is still somewhat foreign. Hooking a
personal computer to the phone system in other Italian hotels I
visited was either impossible or more trouble than it was worth. On
the next trip I'll leave the computer home, and look for cafes that
serve Internet access along with gelato and cappuccino.
</P>
<P>
   For hikers, bikers and others who take the roads less traveled,
satellite technology makes it more difficult to get lost. The
planet is now circled by a necklace of Global Positioning System
(GPS) satellites that, when signaled by a hand-held receiver
anywhere on the globe, can provide the traveler's exact position,
velocity, speed and altitude.
</P>
<P>
   With a CD-ROM or DVD drive in the computer, the traveler can
carry libraries' worth of information on a few shiny disks.
</P>
<P>
   Are these gadgets passing fads? The form and function of the
devices will certainly evolve, the computer and consumer
electronics industries have taught us, but the underlying idea of
ubiquitous and enhanced communication through computers is clearly
here to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are beginning to install power outlets in their craft
to accommodate gadget-laden travelers, initially in the first-class
sections, but eventually throughout the cabin. Airborne gambling,
shopping and videoconferencing may all be ubiquitous in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels are trying to get smarter too, technically speaking,
offering automated check-in and check-out and an array of in-room
amenities for the connected traveler. The Westin Century Plaza
Hotel and Tower in Century City, Calif., in 1996 established a
``cybersuite'' with an electronic butler that responded _
erratically, some visitors reported _ to voice commands asking it
to turn on the stereo, open the drapes, draw a bath, and adjust the
room temperature. The butler, named Alexander, was removed last
year after requiring almost constant maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   But of course any system that relies on technology is subject to
disruption, and a widespread technology failure can disrupt travel
as much as a winter blizzard. The infamous Y2K bug, a programming
glitch that is expected to affect millions of computers and
embedded microprocessors in less than a year, is certain to disrupt
transportation systems when the calendar flips to Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   While the Y2K issue may dampen the enthusiasm of travelers
hoping to spend New Year's Eve away from home, only a small number
of extremists believe that it will cause more than a temporary
disruption. Meanwhile new technologies will inevitably emerge. Once
people establish communications with other people and places,
physical travel follows.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hate airplanes, kill your computer,'' said Saffo, the
futurist. ``The simple fact is that over the past half century or
so, travel miles and telecommunications minutes have chased each
other upward. If you talk long enough, it is going to lead to
face-to-face meetings, and that usually means traveling. Then you
continue the conversation electronically between meetings.''

JOINT VENTURE AIMS TO CREATE INTERNET WORLD WITHOUT WIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In what is being billed as the next giant step in the
Internet revolution, the MotorolaCorp., the maker of wireless
communications products, and Cisco SystemsInc., which provides
Internet equipment, plan to form an alliance that would build the
world's largest wireless Internet system.
</P>
<P>
   The project is the most ambitious effort yet to build a global
network that would enable businesses and consumers to have
high-speed Internet access to e-mail and faxes without the burden
of wires, cables or even walls.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which is expected to be announced Monday at a cellular
telephone conference in New Orleans, makes Motorola and Cisco
Systems the latest communications and networking giants to join
forces in an attempt to capitalize on the increasing popularity of
the Internet and the rapid growth of wireless communications
products.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, several telecommunications companies have
announced plans to offer new services or upgrade their wireless
communications operations so that businesses and consumers may have
some access to the Internet. The AT&AMP;T Corp., for instance, already
is offering wireless service that taps into electronic mail and
Internet information.
</P>
<P>
   The race to transform communications through the Internetalso
has led to several giant mergers that could result in greater
wireless access. In June, Northern TelecomLtd. of Canada, one of
the largest makers of telecommunications gear, said it would
acquire Bay Networks Inc., a large data networking company. Just
last month, Lucent Technologies, the former research arm of AT&AMP;T,
announced its acquisition of Ascend Communications, a leading
provider of Internet equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the MicrosoftCorp., Apple Computer Inc. and
Qualcomm Inc., the wireless communications outfitter, also have
expressed an interest in developing products related to wireless
Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a trend,'' said Roberta Wiggins, a wireless
communications analyst at the Yankee Group in Boston. ``People have
been saying: `There are all these people with cell phones and all
these people accessing the Internet, and at some point people are
going to put these two things together.'''
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Wiggins and other analysts say that developing a
wireless system could be costly and cumbersome _ with competing and
incompatible systems trying to transmit bulky data and video into
wireless units _ officials at Motorola and Cisco say their vision
of a world where automobiles could get tuneups by wireless signals
and sales executives could obtain company information from a remote
place is just beyond the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This extends the Internet to a world without wires,'' said Don
Listwin, executive vice president at Cisco, based in San Jose,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next four or five years, Motorola and Cisco say they
plan to invest more than $1 billion to create a system capable of
transmitting voice, data and video over existing cellular telephone
stations directly to wireless telephones, laptop computers and
other devices.
</P>
<P>
   The system would create a new line of products for Motorola, a
new generation of wireless networking gear for Cisco and perhaps
even signal the convergence of several existing communications
products, like pagers, cellular telephones, televisions, radios and
computers. ``The goal is that instead of having four or five
communication devices in your briefcase, you'll have one or two,''
said Doug Wills, a spokesman for Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies also plan to open four jount research and
development centers, two in the United States and two abroad.
</P>
<P>
   A critical piece of the puzzle, Motorola and Cisco say, is that
the wireless transmissions would be delivered using an Internet
Protocol platform that is compatible with all wireless formats.
Unlike analog or digital platforms, the companies say that the
Internet Protocol, or IP platform, will be able to effectively
deliver and bundle voice, data and video feeds through cellular
stations.
</P>
<P>
   What is novel about the effort, the companies say, is that they
plan to adopt an ``open'' standard. In other words, they plan to
create a wireless industry standard that could be adopted by any
company that wants to develop different or competing products. Such
an open standard, officials say, would be different from other
wireless Internet efforts now under development. The new IP
framework will be published this spring in a ``white paper,'' the
companies said.
</P>
<P>
   For Motorola, which has stumbled of late in the world of
wireless communications, the deal with Cisco is an attempt to help
resurrect its reputation as an innovative company. After two years
of earnings shortfalls and market share losses tied to its line of
wireless telephones, Motorola has been on an aggressive path to new
wireless ventures.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., and had sales
of $29 billion in 1998, has a huge stake in Iridium, a satellite
venture that offers voice and paging systems. In May, when sharp
cuts were being made in its work force, Motorola abandoned a plan
to spend $13 billion to build what it called its Internet in the
Sky project, a satellite network capable of delivering high-speed
data communications anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Motorola said it would invest about $750 million in
Teledesic, a low-orbit satellite venture that also intends to
deliver high-speed access to the Internet, beginning in 2003. The
new wireless venture with Cisco, officials at Motorola say, is
different but would be compatible with Iridium and Teledesic, which
was founded by William H. Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, and
Craig McCaw, the cellular telephone pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, company officials say, they have hit upon a revolutionary
scheme. ``With this system you can get Internet information any
time, anywhere,'' said Bo Hedfors, senior vice president at
Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   As for Cisco, executives say the new venture will strengthen its
move into the telecommunications equipment market, where it is
battling companies like Lucent and Nortel. By forming an alliance
with Motorola, Cisco _ which among other things sells networking
gear to telephone providers _ is staking out firmer ground in its
efforts to persuade global companies to use its equipment and the
Internet to transfer information.
</P>
<P>
   Though some analysts insist that Motorola and Cisco face many
hurdles in creating a wireless Internet system, including the
prospect of transmitting bulky video feeds over a wireless network,
the two companies say the framework they have outlined already has
won strong support from big telephone service providers like
Sprint, Nextel and Airtouch Communications.

WAS THE VICTORIA'S SECRET SHOW A WEB FAILURE? HARDLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a fashion show is Webcast on the Internet and most people who
try to see it cannot, does it still make a splash? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   New-media case study: the flaunting of Victoria's Secret spring
collection, done live in Manhattan last Wednesday evening and
simulcast on line for the masses. The lingerie company, a unit of
Intimate Brands Inc., spent $1.5 million on one 30-second
television spot during the Super Bowl broadcast and $4 million
afterward to advertise the fashion show in newspapers
internationally, yielding a bonanza of ink, video, bits and
watercooler chat worth exponentially more.
</P>
<P>
   Some news reports focused not on the event's success but on the
fact that some of the millions of would-be viewers were closed out
of the World Wide Web site during the live show. There was also
much ado that many who did manage to establish contact received
audio and video that sputtered under the Web-surfing deluge.
</P>
<P>
   Critics chided both Victoria's Secret and Broadcast.com, the
company that delivered the event over the Internet, for not being
prepared for this flood of visitors to the site. They wrote the
whole thing off as one giant publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding! Publicity is exactly what Victoria's Secret wanted.
And it got the last laugh, orchestrating what might go down in the
textbooks as shrewd multimedia manipulation. The company reports
that a million people logged on to its Web site in the hours after
the spot appeared during the Super Bowl; a full two million turned
up on the day of the fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to be an example of the cross-media
``convergence'' that industry pundits have been breathlessly
promoting as a benefit of the Web, and which has happened only a
few times previously in the medium's short history. Few advertisers
using any other combination of media and subject matter could hope
to amass the kind of reach and frequency that Victoria's Secret did
with such a one-shot campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no longer about advertising per se or marketing per se,
but about branding, and using all this multi-dimensional media,''
said Allan Mottus, publisher of The Informationist, a beauty
industry newsletter. ``Fashion ain't Paris anymore, and it ain't
New York, and it's not Victoria's Secret's 800 stores. Now, every
household that has an Internet connection is a fashion store.''
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl spot, the newspaper ads and the Web site were the
work of Resource Marketing, an agency in Columbus, Ohio, with an
estimated $75 million a year in revenue; its other clients include
Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard and Netscape Communications.
</P>
<P>
   While those in marketing looked at the Victoria's Secret ploy
with awe or envy, people more interested in the Internet's
infrastructure expressed frustration over this latest example of
the continued shortcomings of the Web as a mass medium. Invariably,
each time a Web event draws huge crowds, some piece of technology
fails, leaving a certain number of would-be viewers in the dark and
giving the naysayers grounds to declare that the medium is not
ready for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's Secret was not the only company caught by an
overwhelming response. Another first-time Super Bowl advertiser,
Hotjobs.com, was unprepared to accommodate the onslaught of
visitors drawn to its job-hunters' site after seeing its
commercial, a spot on which the company spent half of its annual
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   And in another recent football-related example of a convergence
promise that went awry, ABC canceled promotions for a special Web
site offering player statistics and biographies and an online
play-along game during the Jan. 4 Fiesta Bowl, after the site
reached 100,000 users just minutes into the broadcast. Executives
at ABC, a unit of the Walt Disney Co., later acknowledged that they
had no idea the offering would prove so popular.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who did manage to log on to the live Victoria's
Secret fashion show did not see anything near the video quality of
the glistening, bouncing, full-motion Super Bowl promotional spot.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Dadekian, a digital video consultant in New York, called
the Victoria's Secret Webcast a ``disservice'' to the state of the
Webcasting art. No Web organization, Dadekian said, can handle the
big numbers lured to the fashion show. And he also criticized the
fashion show's production values.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't put dark pictures, a couple of spotlights, a
far-away camera, on the Web; it may look great for television, but
you can't do that for streaming video,'' he said, referring to live
video on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Such fretting may miss the point. The Internet doesn't have an
endless capacity to accommodate every potential viewer of a live
show, as TV does. But aside from the occasional traffic jam, the
Internet can give viewers what they're looking for when they want
it. Now that the rubberneckers are gone, the shoppers _ and gawkers
_ can turn to the Victoria's site any time and see the show at
their convenience.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's Secret was able to reach customers in countries where
the company doesn't have stores or doesn't distribute the 350
million catalogs that it mails annually _ that's the value of the
Web. So are the company's early numbers indicating that men seem
more willing to buy on line than in Victoria's Secret stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is not to mimic television,'' said Mark Cuban,
president of Broadcast.com. ``If you wanted to buy television, you
would just buy television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't trying for perfection,'' he added. ``We were just
trying to help Victoria's Secret reach their goals. This is very
much a perception-and-momentum business, and all of a sudden
they're the talk of the industry.''

A COMPUTER PROGRAM THAT THINKS LIKE A HUMAN (ALMOST) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JANET STITES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Silicon Alley in New York is known for many things,
but not as a hotbed for advances in computer science.
</P>
<P>
   Mention genetic algorithms or artificial intelligence, common
parlance among computer scientists, and eyes may very likely roll
among even the most respected new-media executives in New York. In
fact, an almost Luddite attitude toward hard technology seems to
prevail in Silicon Alley, where Bikini.com, ``the world's biggest
beach party,'' is an example of the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   On the fringes of Silicon Alley, though, can occasionally be
found a company like Intelligenesis Corp., which was founded in
early 1997 by Ben Goertzel, a mathematician, and Lisa S. Pazer, a
former Wall Street economist and analyst. Intelligenesis is trying
to change the way people measure business risks or make buying
decisions by combining, in a software program called Webmind,
elements of the Internet with artificial intelligence technology or
``machine learning,'' by which the software can, for example,
``remember'' who Alan Greenspan is and why he matters.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is the brainchild of Goertzel, who received his
Ph.D in mathematics at age 22 from Temple University, then did
research at the University of Western Australia and later taught
mathematics, computer science and psychology at City University of
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, I had been designing an architecture for
artificial intelligence, but didn't have the machine to do it on,''
said Goertzel, now 32. ``When I started using the World Wide Web, I
realized it was a metaphor for the brain _ that the Web could be a
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Webmind gathers and processes what it perceives as ``human
intelligence'' data from text documents, like news articles _
whether on the Internet or corporate networks _ to help users spot
trends or make predictions. The results, which can be presented as
numbers, a chart or perhaps eventually even a sentence, are meant
to complement rather than replace traditional mathematical modeling
_ to help analysts, in a sense, to read between the lines.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pazer herself left off trying to outguess Greenspan and quit
Wall Street in 1993 to write a novel. But after coming across
Goertzel's research on the Web, she put aside her book to start
Intelligenesis, where she now serves as president and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how she explains Webmind: ``If you want to try to
determine whether Greenspan is likely to raise interest rates,
Webmind can query news archives for Greenspan's comments over the
last six months. Because it understands aspects of natural
language, it can give a qualitative answer by building a graph
giving weight to each of his comments and showing how he reacted in
the past in relation to his comments. You don't search for
documents; you search for answers.''
</P>
<P>
   At full throttle, the software is supposed to be able to answer
specific queries that depend on establishing relationships, like
``How much money did the United States give to Russia in 1998?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pazer contends that Webmind has far-reaching applications.
``The financial market is our proving ground,'' she said. ``We can
measure risk and volatility. But the technology could be used by
anyone trying to evaluate risk or isolate trends.'' The list of
potential users ranges from risk managers at insurance companies to
market researchers to political strategists.
</P>
<P>
   But Webmind is still in its infancy. Intelligenesis is currently
testing the software with potential customers and has a
demonstration for qualified users at its Web site,
www.intelligenesis.net. ``We have to prove to them that the
technology works,'' Ms. Pazer said.
</P>
<P>
   If they do that, Goertzel and Ms. Pazer hope to develop
partnerships, supplying Webmind to financial news services or other
online information providers, in a revenue-sharing arrangement. As
the Webmind brand becomes more established, Ms. Pazer would look
for such partnerships to give way to straight licensing deals.
</P>
<P>
   Though the business viability of Intelligenesis' product remains
to be seen, the company has attracted the involvement of some
influential people.
</P>
<P>
   The vice chairman, for example, is John B. Evans, a co-founder
and chairman of another Alley-based company, Biztravel.com. Danny
Hillis, co-founder of the supercomputer company Thinking Machines,
who is now vice president of research and development in Walt
Disney Co.'s department of imagineering, recently joined the
Intelligenesis strategic advisory board.
</P>
<P>
   Among others who are watching the progress of Webmind is
Alexander Chislenko, a researcher at the Media Lab at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology who has followed Goertzel's work for some
time, because it complements some of his own. ``I think it's a
credible technology, and the approach is promising,'' Chislenko
said. He predicted that Webmind would prove valuable in modeling
some parts of the financial market that other technologies cannot.
But Chislenko cautioned, ``No technology can predict the whole
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Backed solely by private investors so far, Intelligenesis
employs nearly 30 people, with a heavy mix of programmers trained
in the social sciences _ some working from the company's office in
New York city, others commuting by way of the Internet from Norway,
Russia, Brazil and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Goertzel and Ms. Pazer contend that all the really significant
predictions and decisions that people make are, in the end, based
on human psychology. And Webmind, they say, can use artificial
intelligence to translate the multitudinous outpourings of human
psychology into valuable data.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about Webmind, think about being at a cocktail
party,'' Ms. Pazer said. ``Think if you could process not just the
conversations you had, but all the conversations in the room.''

CRITERIA PROPOSED FOR ISSUING OF INTERNET ADDRESSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Companies wanting a piece of the lucrative business
of issuing Internet addresses will need at least $100,000 in the
bank, $500,000 in liability insurance and a proven computer
infrastructure, under minimum requirements proposed Monday by the
nonprofit corporation that has been tapped to take over
administration of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, ``domain registration,'' as the issuing of Internet
addresses is known, has been the government-sanctioned monopoly of
Network Solutions Inc., a Virginia-based company that grew rich on
the business.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Network Solutions priced a new stock offering
Monday. In the more than a year that it has taken the Clinton
administration and the nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers to open the business to competition, Network
Solutions has set up an international network of partners to
administer its domain registration business around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed guidelines were announced just as Network Solutions
completed what is expected to be the largest secondary stock
offering ever by an Internet company. The offering of 4.58 million
shares was priced Monday by J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. to open Tuesday on
Nasdaq at $170 a share. The sale is expected to bring in about $780
million for Network Solutions' parent company, the Science
Applications International Corp., which will reduce its ownership
in the company to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Network Solutions, based in Herndon, Va., has had
the exclusive worldwide right to assign Internet addresses that end
in .com, .net and .org, charging $70 to register a domain name for
two years. The result has been phenomenal growth, with net income
in the first nine months of 1998 growing threefold, to $7.5
million. Although 1998 revenues have not yet been reported,
analysts have predicted they could hit $90 million, compared with
$6 million, $18 million and $45 million, respectively, in the
previous three years.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the nonprofit corporation, known as Icann, also posted
competing sets of proposed bylaws for the supporting organization
being formed to help the nonprofit corporation decide when and how
to add new ``top-level domains'' _ the three-letter suffixes of
Internet addresses, like the popular .com.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines and bylaws have been posted for public comment.
Final versions are expected to be approved by Icann's board of
directors at its next meeting, to be held in Singapore March 2
through 4.
</P>
<P>
   Icann's initial goal is to introduce five competitors to Network
Solutions by the end of April. That test is expected to last about
two months. Then Icann plans to let an unlimited number of
companies around the world participate in the registry.
</P>
<P>
   But the board first must decide a number of other issues,
including how it will pick the first five companies and how much
they will have to pay Network Solutions for its operating of the
main registry, the worldwide list of addresses that directs
Internet traffic around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Esther Dyson, interim chairman of Icann, said the
board would likely hold an international lottery to pick the five
test companies. That option, however, is being reconsidered because
of opposition from a number of groups, including the European
Union, which fears that domain registration will not be
geographically balanced.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dyson said the board wanted to insure that the first five
included a variety of big and small companies from different parts
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines say the primary criteria for selecting
participants for the test phase ``would be the applicant's
technical and business capabilities to support the test and its
willingness to commit the resources and to collaborate closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Secondary considerations ``include the extent to which the
applicant's participation would promote early robust competition,
wide geographic availability of domain name registration services,
and accommodation of alternative business models and types.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed guidelines are outlined by Icann in a 30-plus page
document posted on its Web site after the stock markets closed
Monday. In addition to minimum technical, operational and financial
issues, the criteria also deal with protections against fraud and
infringement of intellectual property rights; data security,
privacy and special technical requirements to protect Internet
stability and operational integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Icann has proposed that applicants who want to compete in the
test phase pay a $2,500 application fee. That would drop to $1,000
when competition is opened to an unlimited number of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Companies would then be required to pay an additional $3,000 to
$6,000 accreditation fee, and would give Icann $1 a year for each
domain name registered. Network Solutions last year registered
about 1.9 million new domain names.
</P>
<P>
   The monetary requirements are likely to raise protests from
smaller Internet groups who fear that Icann is being driven by
large corporate interests. However, Ms. Dyson said that the board
was trying to ``make it pretty easy to be one of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that implementing changes in the domain name
system will be a contentious issue,'' she said. ``The point is to
make the transition fair and the results fair. As long as everyone
knows the rules and can play on the same terms, we will have
achieved that. As the initial board considers comments on the
guidelines, we will work hard with the Internet community to
develop guidelines that strike everyone as reasonable, sound and
transparent.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Bura, president of Alldomains.com, a Pleasant Hill,
Calif., company that plans to apply to be a test registrar, said
the guidelines and capital requirements looked ``doable.''

LEADING RECORDING COMPANIES TO TEST ON-LINE DIGITAL SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The five major recording companies said Monday that
they would, for the first time, begin to test selling albums as
digital information transmitted over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A new system to be tested this spring is intended to sell
authorized recordings in a medium where most of the music,
legitimately copied and otherwise, is now available free.
</P>
<P>
   The system was announced Monday in New York by IBM, which
created the software, and the five major recording companies _
Sony, Time Warner, the Universal unit of the Seagram Co., EMI Group
and Bertelsmann Music Group. The system would let consumers pay for
an album by credit card, download it with a cable modem in less
than 10 minutes, and play it back through computer speakers or
record it on tape, digital minidisks, recordable compact disks or
other devices now on the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   A booklet would also be downloaded, to be printed on a color
printer.
</P>
<P>
   The test, to begin between April and June, will involve 1,000
subscribers to Time Warner's Roadrunner cable modem service in San
Diego. Initially, 1,000 album titles and several hundred singles
will be available, the companies said; the number of selections is
to more than double in the six to nine months the test will be
conducted. The companies have not announced their pricing for the
digital products.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of music recordings are already available on
the Internet free, as files that have been copied without
permission from CD's in a format called MP3. Music companies have
scrambled to find a way to sell legitimate copies of their products
on line in what they call a ``secure'' format.
</P>
<P>
   In this test, they will employ a digital watermark containing
information on where the music came from and who owns the rights;
the data will be encrypted so that only a legitimate user can play
it back.
</P>
<P>
   The music companies also want the online music to be ``copy
protected,'' enabling them to determine the number of digital
copies a consumer could make.
</P>
<P>
   In December, recording and technology companies said they would
collaborate on the Secure Digital Music Initiative, a uniform
standard for codes to be included with music transmitted digitally.
The San Diego test does not supplant the initiative, which is
intended to set standards for a new generation of digital players.
</P>
<P>
   The MP3 files now found on the Internet can be copied freely,
but are of unpredictable quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you compete with something that's free?'' said Larry
Kenswil, executive vice president of the Universal Music Group.
``Obviously you can't compete on price. Instead, you have to offer
higher quality, customer service and ease of use.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry is counting on the spread of cable modems
and other high-speed, or ``broadband,'' connections, because
conventional dial-up modems receive information too slowly to make
digital distribution practical. Kenswil predicted that in five
years, 20 percent of American homes would have broadband
connections. In fact, he said, digital distribution of music would
be an incentive for consumers to subscribe to cable modem systems.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Vidich, executive vice president of Warner Music Group,
said that the industry ``most enthusiastic about this, second only
to the music industry, is the cable industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The recording companies have no intention of abandoning plastic
disks. They plan to announce specifications soon for DVD Audio, a
CD-sized disk that will offer multichannel sound and be encoded to
prevent digital copying. DVD audio disks will hold considerably
more music than audio CD's, making them very hard to transmit over
the Internet even at today's fastest speeds.

Won't you be my online valentine? 
By Bill Husted  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Valentine's Day _ in theory at least _ should be one
of the most personal holidays on the calendar. It should be a time
to turn off the computer and take the person you love to a
restaurant, buy flowers, send notes written in longhand and, my
gosh, hug.
</P>
<P>
   But in this cyber-world, there are complications.
</P>
<P>
   There may be people whom you'd like to take to dinner, but _
because of distance or circumstances _ cannot. Or perhaps your
excuse is even more flimsy _ maybe you just flat forgot to buy the
candy or the card and need a last-minute way to say ``I care.''
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to decide for yourself if an electronic greeting
from the Internet has the warmth and feeling you would like to
convey. For some folks, it would be better to just pick up the
phone instead. But if your valentine would enjoy an electronic
greeting, then the Web can furnish plenty of choices.
</P>
<P>
   The first site on our tour of love offers electronic greeting
cards for free. You'll find all types, including cards customized
for Valentine's Day, as well as cards for friends, lovers, bosses,
casual acquaintances (why the heck are you sending them a card
anyway?) and almost any other occasion or relationship possible.
It's called Blue Mountain and is located at
http://www1.bluemountain.com.
</P>
<P>
   Just click on the category of card you'd like to send,
personalize the message and push the button. Your greetings arrive
almost instantly. And there are cards in other languages. In this
wide world, that's a handy thing to have. There's no charge at all.
</P>
<P>
   The next site isn't free, but it's worth mentioning since it
offers to send real paper greeting cards for you. Just select the
card online and give the address. You'll find the site at
http://sparks.com. Prices vary, but most of the cards, including
mailing, go for about $2.75. If a card isn't enough, you can also
send other gifts, including chocolates, from the same site.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you do for the unconventional valentines on your
list? One thing, for those who have an out-of-this-world valentine,
is to send one of the science-fiction-oriented Valentine's Day
cards from 3D Adventure at
http://www.dair3.com/greeting/valentin.cgi. Some of the cards are
really quite beautiful, and many include animation.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all these sites work in the same general way. You select
a category, click on the card that you like, furnish your e-mail
address and the address of your valentine, and the card is sent. In
almost every case, your recipient will need access to the World
Wide Web to view the card. So if the person you care about has
access to e-mail only, perhaps you should try sending a personal
message, instead of an e-card.
</P>
<P>
   A personal favorite is a Web site called Regards.Com. It's also
free and _ as you would expect _ includes an assortment of
ready-made Valentine's Day cards. But if you have a Web site, you
can use Regards to send a greeting card that includes an electronic
image or photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Just place the image or photograph on your own Web space and
then fill in the blanks at Regards to include that image in a
customized card. If you don't have a Web site, you can also include
Web addresses for images that you've found on other sites.
</P>

   If none of these sites suit you, simply do a search for ``free
electronic greeting cards,'' and you'll find literally hundreds of
other places that offer everything from sweet sentiments to racy
adult-oriented cards. And keep in mind that there's still plenty of
time to do something really crazy: Buy a real card and send it
through the mail.

 Internet2 Ready to Enter Cyberspace  
 By Jon Swartz   
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Backers of Internet2 _ a faster, more powerful sequel to the
Internet _ are launching the online system nationwide this month.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of universities and high-tech companies yesterday
announced that a key technological piece of the private research
network _ dubbed the Abilene project _ will connect 70 college
campuses, including Stanford University, the University of
California at Berkeley and Harvard University, as well as major
corporate sponsors Cisco Systems, Qwest Communications and Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   When operational on February 24, the 13,000-mile, 2.4
gigabits-per-second network will be 100 to 1,000 times faster than
the commercial Web.But it will be available to far fewer people:
Only researchers and employees at the colleges and corporate
sponsors can use it and it will not be offered to consumers. Some
140 universities that have financially contributed to Internet2
should have access to the new network by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers will eventually be able to use cutting-edge
applications developed on Internet2, but only after they have been
developed and sold by Internet2 members for commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's rollout was ``like driving in the final golden spike
on the transcontinental railroad,'' said Stephen Wolff, executive
director of advanced Internet initiatives at Cisco Systems in San
Jose. ``After pieces of the network have run for a few months, the
full-fledged national network is operational.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, in fact, is providing a ``golden router'' as the final
technology piece to tie together the network, according to
Internet2 organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Regional segments of Internet2, including California, have been
in use since last year. The high-speed fiber-optic network, which
serves as a virtual university for students and professors, can
transmit a 30-volume encyclopedia in less than two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Abilene project, based in Washington, D.C., would link
together the disparate geographical segments. It will enable
educators and government officials across the country to perform
ultra-fast online research and develop real-time visual and sound
applications that are not possible over the Internet today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Internet is not restricted by bandwidth,'' said Internet2
spokesman Greg Wood, who predicts the new Net will be a breeding
ground for 21st century applications for the research, education
and consumer markets.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers in different states could design products together in
3-D environments. Hospitals would be able to collaborate on
diagnosing diseases by using computer-generated images broadcast
over the Net. And college professors and students could mine vast
databases of information from ``digital libraries'' at more than
100 universities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   COL. 1 of INTERNET () &QL; 
Internet2 and a similar project, the government-backed Next
Generation Internet, are modeled after the original Internet _
except they'll use fiber-optic circuits instead of standard
telephone lines and more sophisticated software. Both projects plan
only limited links to the Internet.

AMAZON.COM AGREES TO DISCLOSE PAYMENTS FOR PLACEMENT OF BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JAMIE BECKETT and JON SWARTZ   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Responding to allegations that it charges book
publishers for recommendations on its Web site, online bookseller
Amazon.com Tuesday offered customers full refunds for any book it
had touted, and promised to begin disclosing when it has received a
fee for prominent placement of a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard from our customers,'' said Bill Curry, spokesman for
Seattle-based Amazon.com, the largest online bookseller and one of
the most successful Internet companies of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported Monday that Amazon had stepped up
its sale to booksellers of promotional packages, costing up to
$10,000. A package might include prime placement on a particular
page, inclusion in the ``What We're Reading'' feature, an author
profile or interview and ``complete Amazon.com editorial review
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said, ``Such promotions do not contain any notice or
visual clue to indicate that publishers have backed the
recommendations with advertising dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry would not comment on the Times story. But Amazon said in a
press release that ``its recommendations are not and never have
been for sale to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The company did acknowledge that publishers can pay for prime
placement. And beginning March 1, it will list which featured
placements are paid for and which are not.
</P>
<P>
   Effective immediately, Amazon also said it would ``widen'' its
book-return policy. ``Customers can return any book Amazon.com has
recommended, even after it has been read.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos added, ``It doesn't matter how
dog-eared or worn it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Payments for prime placement of products is common in
bookstores, supermarkets and other ``bricks and mortar'' retailers.
But, as Amazon.com learned, the rules are different on the Web,
where editorial content such as book or product reviews is
interspersed with, and often indistinguishable from, paid
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's expectations are different online,'' said Julie
Wainwright, chief executive officer of movie retailer Reel.com,
which does not publish any paid editorial content. ``The problem
(for Amazon.com) is that they tried to appear more pure than they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Ron Rappaport of Zona Research Inc. in Redwood City,
Calif., said the Amazon affair ``casts a slight smudge on
e-commerce. Consumers already have a stigma about shopping online
because of concerns over privacy. An admission from the leading
e-commerce company that it has misled them is a hit for e-commerce.
This isn't fastbuck.com that stacked the deck; it's Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon had revenues of $610 million last year and expects more
than a billion this year. It has 6 million customers around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Internet observers said the Amazon situation illustrates how
consumers should be aware when they visit any Web site that the
lines between advertising and editorial content are not always
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's got to be a clear distinction between what is content
and what is not. Right now there isn't,'' said Susan Scott,
executive director of TRUSTe, a nonprofit Internet privacy group in
Palo Alto, Calif. ``Consumers should be aware what on a Web site
has been paid for and what hasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott criticized Amazon.com's refund offer as a ``Band-Aid,''
saying that few consumers would bother to return books or recall
which books they had purchased based on a recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the line between advertising and editorial will
become clearer as consumers get more sophisticated and e-commerce
matures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers aren't stupid, especially book lovers,'' said Peggy
O'Neill, an Internet analyst at Dataquest, a San Jose, Calif.,
research firm. ``They will jump on you if they figure out you're
shilling for publishers.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said she expects that other Web retailers will be forced
to follow Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo and Excite, the two leading Internet guide companies, said
that advertisers cannot pay for higher placement of Web sites
listed under search results. But they do sell ad space in specific
areas under sponsorship arrangements. Charles Schwab, for instance,
is one of the sponsors of Excite's Money &AMP; Investing section.
</P>
<P>
   GoTo.com, a Pasadena, Calif.-based Internet search engine, does
charge companies to have their Web sites listed in search results.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the company's pay-for-placement system only lists Web
sites that pay a fee. Those that pay the most get the highest
billing. The Web site promotes itself as ``the only search engine
where you can actually determine your placement within the search
results.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com stock, a high-flyer, fell $9.13 to $100 per share
Tuesday.

   Home Section stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Thursday, Feb. 11:
</P>
<P>
   FURNITURE-AUCTION (New York) _ Leslie Keno, the director of the
American furniture department at Sotheby's, has examined as many as
100,000 objects in his life. But none had ever affected him the way
a rare and important secretary-bookcase that he hoped would
highlight the bidding that day. He had estimated the
secretary-bookcase to bring between $500,000 and $800,000. He hoped
it would bring much, much more. By Thatcher Freund.
</P>
<P>
   MELROSE-PLACE (Undated) _ The cancellation of ``Melrose Place,''
after seven years, will provoke a rash of tributes to it as
addictive soap opera and camp classic. But maybe the real appeal of
``Melrose'' is not just the guilty, sometimes kinky pleasure of
living vicariously through beautiful people with big problems, but
also a different kind of fantasy. Dorm life, in adulthood. By Rick
Marin.
</P>
<P>
   WINDSOR-CHAIRS (Hampton, N.H.) _ ``Probably the greatest public
relations coup in the history of humanity was the Shakers
convincing the rest of the world that they made good chairs,''
Michael Dunbar is telling a shopful of would-be Windsor chair
makers. ``Shaker chairs are terribly uncomfortable,'' he continues.
``Dave found a picture a while ago of a Shaker dining room,'' he
adds, referring to his assistant Dave Wachnicki, ``and they didn't
have Shaker chairs _ they had Windsors!'' Welcome to Dunbar's shop,
the country's only full-time school for Windsor chair making. By
Bill Wellman.
</P>
<P>
   CUOMO-LOGO (Undated) _ The logo is nothing spectacular. If it
were for a private business, an ethnic restaurant, say, I wouldn't
give it a second glance. It's just three lowercase letters topped
by what looks like a giant circumflex. But this understated,
economical symbol represents the U.S. government _ the Department
of Housing and Urban Development, to be precise. The big accent
mark is actually a roof. Lisa MacSpadden, the department's deputy
assistant secretary for public affairs, explained that the new
symbol was a pet project of Andrew M. Cuomo, the HUD Secretary. She
volunteered Cuomo for an interview about the logo. By Karrie
Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   BALI-HOUSE (Iseh, Indonesia) _ Hugo Jereissati, a wealthy
Brazilian, fell in love with Bali on his first trip to Indonesia in
1976. But only in the last two years has he been able to live in a

   ELLISON-NOVEL (Undated) _ Nearly a half century after the
publication of Ralph Ellison's landmark novel, ``Invisible Man,''
Random House is preparing to publish his second novel, a work he
struggled with for more than 40 years and left unfinished when he
died in 1994. The novel, ``Juneteenth,'' is set for publication on
June 19 or Juneteenth, the anniversary of the day in 1865 when
Texas slaves finally learned of the Emancipation Proclamation,
which had taken effect two and a half years earlier. By Peter
Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   HUGHES-PLATH (Atlanta) _ For all the notoriety and ugliness that
made them the century's most talked-about literary couple and
divided their admirers into warring camps, the poets Ted Hughes and
Sylvia Plath will remain forever intertwined in the boxes of
documents now emerging from the darkness here at the Emory
University library. Emory, which began purchasing Hughes's
collected papers two years ago as part of its growing archive of
Irish and British writers, has now begun to catalogue and release

100,000 objects in his life. But none had ever affected him the way
a rare and important secretary-bookcase that he hoped would

makers. ``Shaker chairs are terribly uncomfortable,'' he continues.
``Dave found a picture a while ago of a Shaker dining room,'' he

give it a second glance. It's just three lowercase letters topped
by what looks like a giant circumflex. But this understated,
economical symbol represents the U.S. government _ the Department
of Housing and Urban Development, to be precise. The big accent
mark is actually a roof. Lisa MacSpadden, the department's deputy
assistant secretary for public affairs, explained that the new

volunteered Cuomo for an interview about the logo. By Karrie
Jacobs.

HOW TO GRAPHIC TEXT A Gadget That Taught a Nation to Surf: The TV
Remote Control By LISA NAPOLI ACK when the culture of instant
digital gratification was just a gleam in a futuristUs eye, a
revolutionary device was invented that was one of the first steps
toward technological power for consumers: the remote control. It
changed everything. RThe twitch of our fingers on TV remotes was
the first sign of slumbering interactive desires,S said Paul Saffo,
a director at the Institute for the Future, in Menlo Park, Calif.
RThe remote control wasnUt just a new way to change channels. It
changed TV as a medium. Suddenly you didnUt have to watch shows.S
Viewers could channel surf instead. They could watch several
programs at once, have their senses assaulted by sounds and images
and, best of all, they could skip the commercials. The impetus for
the remote control was as much to silence advertisements as to let
viewers remain on the couch. The founder of the Zenith Electronics
Corporation, Eugene F. McDonald Jr., said he thought advertisements
would be the death of the nascent television medium. RHe wanted to
prove his point by making commercials unprofitable,S said Dr.
Robert Adler, the Zenith engineer who created the first practical
wireless remote control, which used ultrasonic signals and went on
the market in 1956. More than nine million televisions with
ultrasonic remote controls were sold in 25 years, according to
Zenith. But the remote control had a different effect. It forced
advertisers to create spots that were more clever so they could
capture the attention of viewers as they clicked through the
channels. RBefore the remote, the advertisers had you as their
hostage,S Mr. Saffo said. RThey knew you werenUt going to get up.S
Dr. AdlerUs creation, called the Space Command, was mechanical. It
literally clicked, or pinged, when a button was pushed. It used an
ultrasonic beam, outside the range of human hearing, to turn a set
on or off or change the channel. The price for a set and a remote
control ranged from $259.95 for a tabletop model to $550 for a
high-end console Q hefty price tags back then. Advertisements for
the Space Command proclaimed that there was Rnothing between you
and the set but space!S Some ads went on to say: RIs it magic? ItUs
like nothing you have ever seen before Q anywhere!S It wasnUt
magic, but it was a big step beyond ZenithUs earlier remote
controls. The first such control, marketed in 1950, was the
inelegant but aptly named Lazy Bones. It was tethered to the set by
a long wire, which made it a living-room hazard. The next version,
in 1955, was wireless. It was essentially a flashlight that changed
the channels when it was focused on sensors built into the cabinet
of a set. Thus its name: the Flashmatic. ROn a sunny day you had to
turn it off because the tuner would just go crazy,S Dr. Adler
recalled in a telephone interview. Disadvantages aside, more than
30,000 Flashmatics were sold. The first remote controls seemed to
be ahead of their time because there were few stations to flip
through in the 50Us. RItUs surprising how early this technology was
created,S said Ronald C. Simon, a curator at the Museum of
Television and Radio in Manhattan. It took awhile for the remote
control to catch on. Among the televisions sold in 1976, 9.5
percent had remote controls; by 1990, 90 percent of them did. But
the advent of the remote control was a big step toward the couch
potato culture to come. Viewers could stay put while they watched,
orchestrating their viewing like maestros with batons, while what
they watched came at them at a faster pace. Over time, there were
more channels and shows than ever before, more than it seemed
possible to navigate. RThereUs a huge magnetic force in the culture
and it goes toward speed, and the remote control was an essential
element in that direction,S said Todd Gitlin, a professor of media
studies at New York University. RTMove it alongU Q thatUs what
matters. The speed of movement and the juxtaposition of different
images is absolutely central to how people are living now.S

<P>
   DAYTONA, Fla. _ As his stock car roared past the empty
black-and-white-checkered spectator stands at 190 miles per hour,
Jeff Gordon could barely hang on to his steering wheel, let alone
check his rpm.
</P>
<P>
   Under the brilliant blue Florida sky at the Daytona
International Speedway, Gordon and a crowd of other drivers were
testing themselves and their cars one day not long ago in
preparation for the Daytona 500, the biggest event in the world of
the National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing.
</P>
<P>
   After a few laps, Gordon thundered to his service spot in the
infield garages, which reeked of gasoline and sweat. Two crew
members jacked up the left side of his charcoal gray Chevy, which
bore an orange skull and crossbones on its hood as it awaited a
rainbow-colored paint job.
</P>
<P>
   One crew member slid under the tailpipe. Another plugged in the
laptop. That data link to the car can reveal a stream of details,
from rpm to shock-absorber performance _ but come race day, on Feb.
14, that data link will be banned.
</P>
<P>
   The sport's carefully calibrated approach to technology creates
both an opportunity and a conundrum for drivers like Gordon, a
superstar of NASCAR racing. Gordon and his crew are among the most
technologically adept racing teams in NASCAR competition, a hugely
popular sport that draws television ratings second only to those of
the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is central to the sport, yet apart from it on race
day. On-board computers, for example, can be used for manufacturing
and test drives, but not during an actual event.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is a factor in Gordon's victories but not the
deciding factor. His team clearly relies on computers for data that
enable him to reach new performance highs, but a lesser driver
would very likely get into that same technology-enhanced car and
drive it into a wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology makes the car better, which forces me to drive
faster,'' said Gordon, 27, taking a break from his racing in a
rainbow-colored fireproof racing suit.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's total 1998 race winnings were $9.3 million _ he is the
two-time defending champion on NASCAR's Winston Cup circuit _ and
he earned much more in endorsements and licensing. Some fans love
him, and some don't, because he wins almost all the time. Some love
him, and some don't, because of his Tom Cruise good looks and
squeaky clean image. (He appears in ``Got Milk?'' advertisements.)
</P>
<P>
   He is the top driver in recent NASCAR history, perhaps a direct
result of the technical prowess that helps give him his winning
edge. He also has one of NASCAR's richest sponsors, DuPont
Automotive Finishes.
</P>
<P>
   The sport's limits on technology are tough. That may seem odd,
considering the millions of dollars spent on high-tech car design
and improvements. It is also true that in NASCAR racing, as in many
other sports, the debate on pushing the rule book on admitting
certain technologies is almost as old as the sport.
</P>
<P>
   But NASCAR officials say such limits are the only way to keep
the sport affordable and, more important, human _ a contest of men
and machines, without computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to throw a rope around the technology,'' said
Gary Nelson, director of the Winston Cup, NASCAR's most elite
series of races. ``If you don't keep that in check, then the team
with the best tech wins. The exciting thing about NASCAR is that
you never know who's going to have a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials have been trying to preserve the soul of their
machine-driven sport since the first race, in the late 1940s, when
drivers drove stock cars from the factories to the beaches of
Daytona, where they would compete without modifications to the
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Other popular forms of auto racing, like Championship Auto
Racing Teams, the sort seen at the Indianapolis 500, and Formula
One, the high-tech European sport, allow telemetry _ the
transmission of data to and from on-board computerized sensors
during a race. Using equipment similar to that employed during
NASCAR test runs, these drivers and crews can ascertain everything
from the left rear tire's pressure to the car's fuel consumption
while the car is moving.
</P>
<P>
   As Nascar racing grew in popularity in the 1960s, Bill France
Sr., the promoter who was largely responsible for that, tightened
the rules for car design and performance improvement to maintain a
level playing field. On-board computers were outlawed as soon as
they became available in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the rules have grown to include several dozen pages of
guidelines, which are continually updated. These govern the size
and specifications of virtually all internal components, from
shocks to telemetry. During the Daytona 500 test drives, a dusty
card table displayed some recent shock absorbers that had been
approved for use.
</P>
<P>
   Though NASCAR has complete jurisdiction over what parts and
technology may be used during a race, it has no authority beyond
the track. As a result, teams like Gordon's might spend up to $10
million per year to develop and manufacture their cars. But no
matter how much they spend, the result must meet with NASCAR's
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a technical viewpoint, it's extremely frustrating,'' said
Jim Wall, lead engineer for Hendrick Motorsports of Harrisburg,
N.C., the company that modifies stock cars for Gordon and other
Nascar stars, like Terry LaBonte and Wally Dallenbach Jr. ``It's my
job to make the car go faster. If there's a problem, I have to find
the solution to fix it, but often I can't use that solution because
it's not legal.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they must abide by the guidelines, which can change as
frequently as every two weeks, the crews are extremely high tech.
Hendrick Motorsports relies on computers for every step of the
production process.
</P>
<P>
   Using computer-aided design and manufacturing software on
Windows NT work stations, Hendrick is able to design a car, down to
a tiny cylinder head, in a completely virtual environment. A
computer-controlled machine then cuts the parts, making them comply
with NASCAR specifications.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   On race day, NASCAR employs a team of 70 inspectors _ usually 8
per car _ to inspect parts and check for hidden computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to train our personnel to find telemetry in the nooks
and crannies,'' said Mike Helton, NASCAR's vice president for
competition. ``We don't want to have to tear a car apart after a
race is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The job of monitoring for technological compliance is becoming
more difficult. Of special concern are tiny chips that provide
traction control, which helps a car improve performance on turns.
Though NASCAR says it has found no violations, Nelson said the
association had recently received a report that a British
manufacturer might be selling hard to detect traction-control chips
for $1 million each.
</P>
<P>
   Even if these chips are purchased and used, Nelson said, they
will probably be discovered eventually. ``If there's traction
control on a car, then the wheels won't spin,'' he said with a grin
as cars rolled out for their test drives. ``That's all we'd have to
look for.'' Throughout the sport, that kind of low-tech swaggering
reinforces the high-tech restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Until telemetry became available in the early 1990s, NASCAR
crews had to rely on the driver's feedback to determine what areas
might need improvement. Today this feedback is measured in
conjunction with what is known as a Pi system, the on-board
telemetry used by the vast majority of the teams during test
drives.
</P>
<P>
   The Pi system, manufactured by a British company named Pi
Research, contains two black boxes, each the size of a pack of
cigarettes, on the floor next to the driver. Transducers run from
the boxes to dozens of locations throughout the car _ the steering
wheel, the shocks, the tires and so on. Pi's sensors measure the
movement of, say, the steering wheel; voltage changes reflect the
movement changes.
</P>
<P>
   When a driver pulls into his garage after a practice lap, his
crew engineer plugs a Windows laptop into a port inside the car.
Within seconds, the data acquired by the Pi system is downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Pi's specially designed analysis software graphs the car's
performance. Back at the shop, crew members interpret the data and
make appropriate changes to the car's parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like sending out the space shuttle and bringing back some
rocks,'' said Gordon's crew chief, Ray Evernham, as he checked a
laptop. ``You don't know what to do with it until you get back.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR officials say they limit on-board telemetry in part to
keep down costs for the owners. ut there is still a high cost. A Pi
system can cost up to $50,000 without software modifications; Pi
has no major competitors in this area. Though some drivers earn
millions annually, the price tag remains too high for others.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Marcis, a veteran NASCAR driver who has been in more than
30 Daytona 500's, could not afford to buy the telemetry for his
test drive. If he wants to know how his shocks are handling the
bumps, he does not have a computer graph; he must look under the
hood to see how high the oil ring on the shock shaft has risen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this new technology takes away from the sport,'' he said.
``I hope it doesn't ruin it. Nascar tries to keep it out, but
there's not much they can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR might restrict computer use inside race cars, but it
relies on them heavily for scoring and timing. An antenna loop is
buried under the track just before the finish line, and each car is
equipped with a radio transmitting transponder that emits its own
unique frequency.
</P>
<P>
   When the car passes the antenna loop, a signal is sent through a
cable to the scoring terminal, which records the car number and the
time.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR began using this system in 1995. But NASCAR cannot afford
to make a mistake, so it has several lower-tech backup systems (and
a second transponder system in place for redundancy). In fact,
extra timekeepers stand at the pit stops to record entrance and
exit times manually.
</P>
<P>
   System crashes are rare, said Phil Housely, NASCAR's timing and
scoring engineer, although the car transponders experience errors
one out of six times. When that happens, ``we always fix it,'' said
Sharon Spicer, an operator, ``but we panic first.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Gordon's recent day in Daytona, he had the fastest
average speed on the track. He pulled back into his garage after
his last lap, and the crew downloaded the Pi system information
while Gordon headed through a crowd of fans to his trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Between bites of a banana, he said the technology enabled him to
be a faster driver. But when the Daytona 500 begins on Feb. 14,
with him in the pole position, he and his crew will be on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see that green flag,'' he said, ``I'm the on-board
computer. I'm the telemetry.'' &QL;

RACING AROUND WITH NO WORRY ABOUT CRASHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID KUSHNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike most sports fans, auto racing die-hards are unable to
mimic their heroes' feats. ``You can't play NASCAR in your
backyard,'' said Blake Davidson, director of interactive marketing
for the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing.
</P>
<P>
   But you can play it on line, courtesy of NASCAR's interactive
division, which is dedicated to producing realistic computer games
and a behind-the-scenes Web site. Fans can race as fast as they
like and if they crash, all they have to do is reboot.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasts for multiplayer games have been competing over the
Internet through the NASCAR Racing Online Series (www.nros.com), a
Net-based game site available through the pay-to-play Total
Entertainment Network. After buying an accompanying CD-ROM and
downloading free software that makes Internet play possible,
players choose and modify cars based on those used by actual
drivers, like Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   The speed might be sluggish compared with the real thing, but
it's enough to keep fans coming back. ``It's a total adrenaline
rush, even when I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing,'' said
Andrew Sarnow, 32, a marketing director from New York who recently
spent $150 on a special computer-game steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   But the NASCAR Online Web site (www.nascar.com) is a fan's most
important link to the racing world. The site employs five full-time
writers who travel to events throughout the year and report back
immediately. There is also a live feed of each event's timing and
scoring _ crucial to fans who cannot tune in to the television
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are occasional snags. Since many NASCAR tracks are
in remote rural locations, it can be difficult to find a stable,
dedicated phone line for uploading the data. ``No matter how high
tech we get,'' Davidson said, ``something like that is hard to
overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Though NASCAR drivers do not use auto simulators, the
association has designed a fleet of the machines for the general
public to use at arcades in shopping malls. Using the interactive
NASCAR Silicon Motor Speedway, fans can get behind the wheel in
scaled-down replicas of actual racing cars in five cities: Chicago;
Minneapolis; Dallas; Irvine, Calif., and West Nyack, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Up to eight players compete head-to-head inside the vehicles,
which rumble and sway on a moving platform. Plans are under way to
network the five centers together so racers can compete across the
country.

   Spending thousands of dollars used to take some effort. You had
to get dressed. Get out of the house. Make eye contact. Count
change. It could take days. Weeks, even.
</P>
<P>
   But getting and spending are easier on line, and the membrane
between impulse and purchase has grown thinner. Web sites draw
surfers toward the shoals of indebtedness, offering novelty, speed,
convenience, bargains, unlimited hours, coupons, new deals daily,
limited sales tax and helpful suggestions from other shoppers.
Simply click on Buy Now, and pay later.
</P>
<P>
   As the credit card bills of history's biggest, most touted
holiday E-commerce season are coming due and accruing double-digit
interest, Internet shoppers are shopping before breakfast, shopping
alone and picking up an extra book or three _ causing some of them
to wind up hiding the resulting credit card bills from their
spouses.
</P>
<P>
   How did these people get hooked? What is so compelling about the
Internet marketplace?
</P>
<P>
   Although online shopping still amounts to only a tiny fraction
of all retail sales _ 1 percent of consumer sales, according to
Joseph Vause, vice president for electronic commerce at Visa USA _
it is expected to match the current catalog and mail-order share of
the market by 2003. And with 99 percent of Internet sales conducted
with credit cards, compared with 20 percent of conventional sales,
the potential to run up a credit card bill is significantly higher.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation to spend money on line can be even harder to
resist when a Web surfer taps into the excitement of an auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ebay is definitely addictive!'' Jane Brasovan of The
Woodlands, Texas, said via e-mail. She estimated that she had
bought 1,500 to 2,000 items, most of them antiques and dolls, on
the Ebay auction site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to stop this addictive cycle at the present
time,'' she continued, ``as I've spent far too much money and now
have a houseful of `things' that I would probably be better off
without!''
</P>
<P>
   In a phone interview, she added: ``It's hard to stop. I've tried
stopping, but I don't do too well. You get kind of carried away,
bidding on something, and when somebody outbids you, you get mad
because they outbid you. You go in and bid and know darned well you
shouldn't. Sometimes you feel like saying, `You're not going to get
that if I can't get it.' '' Ms. Brasovan said she had spent up to
six or seven hours at a stretch on the Ebay site.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Ector, editor and publisher of Covert Shoppers
Anonymous, an online compendium of Web bargains, figures that she
spends $800 a month on line, far more than she used to spend when
driving to stores near her home in West Chester, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just clicking buttons,'' she said, ``and it's easy to
say, `Well, I'll worry about this next month when I get the bill.'
'' She has found herself playing an economies-of-scale game with
shipping and handling charges. ``When I get to the end of that
shopping cart transaction, I've often hit the Back button, gone
back and purchased more things, to make it cost effective,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to find online shopaholics who have become so
hooked on new-media marketing that they have resorted to pilfering
from their children's college funds or have moved back to their
parents'. But there are many people, particularly at the auction
sites, who find themselves powerless in the face of items for sale
on line.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Lunden, who collects McCoy kitchenware from the 1940s and
1950s, signs on to Ebay once a day to see what is being auctioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years I had been looking for a teapot,'' said Ms. Lunden,
director of the McKean County Planning Commission in Pennsylvania.
``I knew there had to be one.'' In October, she found one, and the
closing bids were due at 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I set the alarm and was up at 4:45 in the morning, thinking,
`That gives me 15 minutes to get connected,' '' she said. She
panicked when she discovered that her husband had packed away the
laptop, but she got on line in time to buy the teapot, plus a
creamer and sugar bowl, for $97, including shipping _ ``a real
buy,'' she said. Ms. Lunden lives in Bradford, Pa., population
about 9,600, where the shopping possibilities are limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I really had to have,'' she said of the
teapot. ``I'm not a person to get up in the middle of the night,
but I had to because that's when the bidding was. I had to make a
sacrifice, and it was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally addicted to just surfing thousands of items on
Ebay,'' Gib Bergman, a cook in Sutersville, Pa., wrote via e-mail.
Bergman, a shopper who has bid on scores of items, including
knives, Beanie Babies and Elvis memorabilia, at Ebay, continued:
``And it is so easy to spend money that you don't have just laying
around. It's worse than being an alcoholic _ an obsessive gambler
is more like it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty much an addict,'' Bergman added. His wife, Helen,
used to be able to restrain him from buying, he said, but no more.
``I used to go to flea markets,'' he said. ``You'd see stuff and
she'd say, `That's too much,' but here I'm here by myself. I'll put
a bid in on something and later say to her, `Guess what I got?'
It's just like a candy store _ it is very addictive.''
</P>
<P>
   In 10 years of conventional shopping he could never have
acquired the number of Elvis items he has been able to buy via
Ebay, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on credit and commerce readily recognize the seductions
of E-commerce. Kimberly S. Young, founder of the Center for On-Line
Addiction in Bradford, Pa., said the auction sites were exciting _
shopping as entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're the winner, that's reinforcing,'' she said. ``For
that moment, you're engaged, it gives you a favorable high. You're
completely absorbed in this, and it's kind of an escape mechanism.
You start to think, `What else do I need?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes clicking fingers take over where the brain leaves off,
said Wayne S. DeSarbo, a marketing professor at Pennsylvania State
University. ``There's so little time to think about what you're
doing and rationalize it,'' he said. ``As the result of just a few
keystrokes, you're done and gone. For the compulsive shopper, this
would provide a quick and easy fix from the stress and anxiety of
everyday life. It's a temporary high one gets from shopping.
There's little time for rationalization.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Furmanski, a spokesman for the National Foundation for
Consumer Credit, said it could be easier to buy impulsively on line
than off. ``In the mall, it's easier to recommend that you put an
item down and walk away, and see if you still need it at the end of
your trip, to ease the impulse purchases you make,'' he said. ``On
the Internet, it's not as easy. Maybe you should sign off first,
and it will still be there when you sign back on.''
</P>
<P>
   Splurges on line appear to differ from splurges off line. People
watching the Home Shopping Network might end up with many lifetime
supplies of cubic zirconia and Ginzu knives. But wired shoppers
talk sheepishly of their ``Amazon problems'': a tendency to spend
more at Amazon.com than they had budgeted for books, software and
CDs, items that are, if you rationalize carefully, inherently
useful for self-improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Many aspects of the Internet encourage impulsive or compulsive
buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're alone, and kind of nobody sees what you're doing,''
said the founder of Spenders Anonymous, a support group in
Minneapolis, speaking on the condition of anonymity, ``and when
you're into your addiction, you want it that way.'' For shy people,
an Internet auction provides welcome anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of people that are shy _ not the competitive people
who go to auction houses and compete with real people _ it's a much
safer domain,'' said Young, who is an assistant professor of
psychology at the University of Pittsburgh at Bradford. ``It's
anonymous, it's private, and there is a sense of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet can also empower shoppers, said Austan Goolsbee, an
assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago,
giving them the benefits of haggling and comparison shopping
without making them take the chance of offending anyone face to
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would feel kind of self-conscious asking someone at an
airline to run through 100 scenarios for a flight you want to
take,'' he said, so travelers can fiddle with schedules or
destination cities more easily on line. ``And where you're
comparison shopping, it oftentimes makes people feel a little bad
for walking out of the store.'' But no Web site is going to call a
person rude for heading elsewhere for a better bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Offering power to the consumer can be the Internet's most
effective way to lure buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are now in control, and it is so compelling'' said
Donna Hoffman, a professor of marketing at Vanderbilt University.
``It's not the lack of sales tax, not the convenience, not the
potential economic savings, that makes online shopping attractive.
It's just the chance to be in control. The balance of power between
business and the consumer has shifted radically. If you're the
business, you're no longer in 100 percent control.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic shoppers want convenience, and they want it now.
Where they can get it, they're willing to pay for it, plus shipping
and handling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The modern analogy is the minibar in your hotel room,'' said
Jerry Kaplan, a co-founder of Onsale.com, a discount retailer.
``Would you usually pay $2 for a Diet Coke? Absolutely not. But in
the minibar in the hotel room, you're more likely to go for it.
Here you have people sitting at a computer all day, and a lot of
sales take place. They're discretionary purchases due to
convenience, where you've eliminated the cost of physically going
out and shopping.''

HOW INTERNET KEEP CUSTOMERS COMING BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If suckers are born every minute, there is a new technique every
second to capture them on the Web. Here are some of the ways Web
site designers lure people in and transform them from surfers into
loyal customers.
</P>
<P>
   The first and most obvious _ and perhaps the most subtle _ is to
make the visitor feel part of a community. Amazon.com is a place
where book lovers can get thoughtful and often erudite advice about
books (never mind that some publishers pay to have their book
featured on the site).
</P>
<P>
   The Ebay chat boards welcome lovers of Elvis memorabilia to a
place where they can send e-mail to other lovers of Elvis
memorabilia, and Furby owners can send e-mail using their fuzzy
dialects without anyone from the rest of the world raising an
eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the Ebay model. What it really provides
for some people is shopping as entertainment, which is why some
people keep going back for more of both. Shopping sites may also
offer user-friendly technology. Amazon.com has what could be called
a Dwim _ ``do what I mean'' _ search function.
</P>
<P>
   If someone wants to find an Alanis Morissette CD, ``it doesn't
matter how many n's, r's or s' you put in,'' said David Risher,
senior vice president for product development at Amazon. ``We look
at misspellings people have made the day before,'' he explained.
That's smart technology _ basically learning from shoppers' dumb
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Most sites worth their salt will send instantaneous e-mail
messages to confirm an order, with periodic updates on the status
of shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com keeps track of the books you have bought and sends
e-mail suggestions about new releases that might appeal to you.
Even if the recipient doesn't buy, such e-mail messages can still
sell books. ``I frequently forward them to other people,'' said
Marnie Berk, a lawyer in New York. She said many of her
time-pressed co-workers were addicted to Amazon because they did
not have time to step out to visit a real-life bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web sites keep track of information about you, including
credit card numbers, to speed sales. For customers who are wary of
giving out credit card information, some sites provide a toll-free
number and let you create an order on line and arrange payment by
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod.com, a grocery service, has a practice function that
allows people in certain cities to try out shopping for food on
line without actually buying anything _ or submitting credit card
numbers. Once shoppers feel comfortable, they are more likely to
buy.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites try to establish ongoing relationships with
customers. For example, if you click on an advertisement for a
tax-preparation software package from Beyond.com but do not buy it
right off the bat, you will receive e-mail on March 15 reminding
you that you still need the software, said Scott Heiferman, the
chief executive at I-traffic, an online shopping agency. Peapod.com
will even remind coffee shoppers to buy creamer.
</P>
<P>
   Site designers have found that surfers do not like to be
overwhelmed with information. Successful commercial sites offer a
handful of items for sale on a page, not the whole inventory.
</P>
<P>
   The ``blue light special'' has also found a home on the Web. If
sites have good deals available for only a few hours at a time,
people are more likely to check them regularly, just as they check
e-mail or stock quotes or auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod.com provides selective searching, so if you type in
``peanut butter,'' you see only the various peanut butters
available, not peanut butter cups or peanut butter bits. Again,
fewer options make for happier customers.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Parkinson, chief technology officer for Peapod.com, said:
``We know exactly where you are. We have a universal event
processor. We collect information on your previous purchases, and
other information on you, like the delivery time you like, the
aisles you go down. The marketing people decide what they want to
target to people who buy this kind of product, or have this many
people in household. But we don't sell any of this information.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sites, like Peapod, offer bonuses to surfers who refer
other customers to the site. For Peapod, the bonus is $20.

<P>
   It is a company that makes its living out of inspiration,
creating and selling brilliant ideas. But how can something as
ephemeral as inspiration be systematically created and nurtured in
an organized, deadline-driven business environment?
</P>
<P>
   One of the answers at Ideo Product Design, a company based in
Palo Alto, Calif., is the Tech Box, a library that catalogs some
200 weird physical materials and odd objects, ranging from rubber
balls to pieces of space shuttle tile, for inspiration-seeking
engineers to play with.
</P>
<P>
   Ideo, a design consulting firm, has engineered everything from
the gummy-toothpaste-resistant cap for Crest's Neat Squeeze
toothpaste tube to the entire body of the handheld Audible Mobile
Player, a new device that downloads recorded books from the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was founded as David Kelley Design in 1978, Ideo has
completed approximately 3,000 projects, including collaborating
with Apple Computer to create the first commercial mouse and some
of the first laptops and assisting in the design of a
virtual-reality headset for Sega. One of Ideo's recent projects
involved the user interface for an easy-to-use portable
defibrillator from Heartstream Inc.
</P>
<P>
   With the Tech Box, the company has cataloged and electronically
documented materials, objects and gadgets. There are six boxes all
told in the company's six major offices _ in San Francisco; Palo
Alto; Grand Rapids, Mich.; Chicago; Boston, and London _ and one
that the company has sold to an office furnishings client,
Steelcase Inc. in Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   Each box has five drawers holding 200-odd objects, which are
tagged, numbered and linked to related Web sites on a company
intranet; access to the intranet is gained through an iMac that
sits on top of the file cabinet. Only Ideo employees (and Steelcase
employees, for their box) have full access to the boxes and
intranet information; Ideo staff members can walk other clients
through the box for brainstorming sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers rummage through the compartments and play with the
items, which include tiny batteries, miniature switches and the
kind of heat-sensitive thermochromatic material that makes mood
rings intuitive, in quests for inspiration. They might be seeking
the right ``click'' for an electronic book's buttons or a
microprocessor cooling mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Montessori approach,'' said Dennis Boyle, a senior
engineer at Ideo who has taught product design classes at nearby
Stanford University for 15 years. ``The whole idea is to go through
and just experience these things.''
</P>
<P>
   As Boyle explored the drawers' compartments, he picked up
various things. ``Here's an electroluminescent display _ you find
it in portable computers and pagers and watches and nightlights,''
he said. ``See how light and flexible it is?''
</P>
<P>
   He handled a piece of Kevlar, the material used in bulletproof
vests, then a sheet of shiny gold-colored Mylar, the insulation
material used in space satellites. A clear gelatinous material in a
small plastic container grabbed Boyle's attention next. He said it
was called Aerogel and explained: ``It's really only four times as
dense as air. It crumbles quickly, and it's somewhat of a hazard,
so we don't let people fool around with it. But in space it's
turned out to be an extremely efficient insulator. It's so light,
it feels like you're holding a piece of smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine Kurjan, an Ideo design engineer who acts as the Tech
Box's curator, added: ``The statistics that go with that are that
if you had a piece the size of your body, it would only weigh a
pound but it would support a car. I've read about it being, in 20
years, usable for windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyle said the Tech Box (and its precursor, a cardboard box of
stuff owned by Boyle) has been a way of collecting information over
the years ``so you don't have to reinvent the wheel every time you
come up with a new idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herron, formerly of Apple and currently vice president for
product development at SoftBook Press Inc., has worked with Boyle
for several years on various projects. In a recent project, the
TechBox helped SoftBook, an electronic book company based in Menlo
Park, Calif., find the right ``click'' for its electronic book
buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years,'' said Boyle, ``there had been a tech collection in
boxes that we'd more or less just dump out on the table for
brainstorming or student talks. It was less formal.''
</P>
<P>
   Herron, who also worked for an Ideo competitor called frogdesign
Inc., based in Silicon Valley said of this kind of object
cataloguing, ``Dennis is the only one I know who's applied it to
high technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating the actual workings of the TechBox, Ms. Kurjan
pointed to the Intranet page displayed on the dimly glowing iMac
while Boyle pulled open the flat drawers. ``Each one of these items
has a page in here,'' Ms. Kurjan said. ``What it is, what it's made
of, how it works.'' The pages also list manufacturers and who, if
anyone, in the company has used the material in a project.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley pointed to a ``phase-change chemical hand-warmer'' _ a
packet you put in ski boots or mittens that releases heat. ``We've
not applied this one yet,`` said Kelley, ``but my favorite concept
for this one is the ``plate in the restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of heating plates before serving them, Kelley would like
to embed the phase change chemical warmer inside the plate to keep
it hot. Because boiling cools the phase-changing chemical warmer,
Kelley, who noted that he is not an engineer, theorized that the
dishwasher would return the hot plate to normal.
</P>
<P>
   The formalizing of the TechBox from a handful of favorite
gadgets on each engineer's desk to a series of catalogd and curated
physical libraries has had more than purely functional merit.
Drawing on the studies of a Stanford organizational behavior
professor, Bob Sutton, who is writing a book based on an 18-month
ethnographic study of Ideo, Kelley says that the box allows for
``status auctions _ which I think comes from anthropology _ you
know, the ape trying to establish dominance.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said he recently rose in status when a discovery of his
was deemed worthy of the TechBox. ``It's a Pack-A-Ccino _ a
cappuccino with its own heat source, so when you're on the ski
slopes you can still have a hot cappuccino. I suspect it's really,
really bad-tasting, but the technology is there, it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyle shook his head and countered that at a staff meeting where
the coffee was sampled, the consensus was that it ``wasn't as bad
as we expected.'' Boyle paused, ``Maybe we could use that for a
piece of sports equipment, or medical equipment, and have it be
very portable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mental tool box,'' Boyle said, glancing at the box, ``a
whole bunch of neat, possibly useful ideas.''

 &HT;    A little chocolate goes a long way for Valentines day
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He says, ``I love you'' with dozens of chocolates in a
big, red, heart-shaped box the size of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   She says, with that hurt look guys never see coming, ``You must
think I'm fat.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how innocent his intentions, he's what plenty of men
end up being on Valentine's Day _ a big loser.
</P>
<P>
   It's a double-edged sword. If your sweetheart is like many
women, she's passionate about chocolate. Liz Cipro, manager of
Atlanta's Paris Market, Georgia's only outlet for Belgium's
Leonidas praline chocolate, knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a woman who called a couple of months ago from
Tallahassee, Fla.,'' Cipro begins. ``She was afraid to have her
Leonidas shipped to her.'' After all, the delicate chocolate candy
is flown in from Europe and has a shelf life of about a week. ``So
she was going to drive up here _ five hours _ to get them.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean she wants to eat a truckload of the stuff.
For many women, chocolate is an indulgence. Just a single serving
of Guylian's delicate, delectable Belgian chocolate seashells, for
instance, contains more than twice the calories and as much
saturated fat as 1 tablespoon of butter.
</P>
<P>
   Liza O'Hare, 37, of Roswell (Ga.), says her husband, Ed, once
gave her a giant heart-shaped box of chocolates for Valentine's.
``This is before I trained him properly,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men equate a giant box of chocolates with their giant love for
you,'' O'Hare says. ``I'd say, `Whooo, that's a lot of chocolate.
You think I'm a pig, and obviously you don't know the rule.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And what is this super-secret maxim?
</P>
<P>
   ``A little chocolate goes a long way,'' O'Hare says.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Retail Federation, Americans spent
$725 million on candy in 1998, with at least a third of that being
boxed chocolate. And the American Boxed Chocolate Manufacturers
expects more than 35 million heart-shaped boxes of chocolate will
be sold for this Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   This year, opt for expensive, high-quality, Lamborghini-style
chocolate that says, ``I love you,'' and still leaves you with a
fat wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Use one or two pieces to finish off a Valentine's dinner and
movie date or pair a small quantity of high-grade chocolate with an
affordable bouquet of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   We've gathered a few samples of great chocolate, each renowned
for its enticing flavor. Just a bit of any of them _ even spending
as little as $5 or less _ will say a lot to your sweetie.
</P>
<P>
   THE SWEET HEREAFTER
</P>
<P>
   We hardly have to tell you of Godiva. With three confectionery
boutiques in metro Atlanta malls, Godiva Chocolatier sells
exquisitely packaged truffles, creams and more than 150 different
chocolate pieces for as much as $125 a box.
</P>
<P>
   But Godiva can be had a lot cheaper. For $5, you can get a
cleverly packaged, red-and-white ruffle-heart box with eight
assorted cordials and bonbons. A four-piece gold ballotin
accompanied by a solid chocolate heart wrapped in red foil and tied
up with a red ribbon sells for $6.50. In fact, the red foil heart
(sold individually for $1.75) might be perfect to place on a loved
one's pillow.
</P>
<P>
   A more adventuresome valentine might like Godiva's solid
chocolate cigars ($2.50 each or $12.50 for a black-and-gold box of
four).
</P>
<P>
   Sources: Godiva Chocolatier boutiques are at Lenox Square
(404-262-2108), North Point Mall (770-442-8670) and Perimeter Mall
(770-671-9650). Limited selections are at major department stores,
including Neiman Marcus, Macy's and Rich's. Godiva Direct
(1-800-946-3482 or http://www.godiva.com) guarantees delivery by
Friday.ALL THE WAY FROM BELGIUM
</P>
<P>
   Belgium's world-class Leonidas come in a variety of shapes and
flavors, including the best-selling Manon Cafe (white chocolate
with a light coffee-flavored fresh cream filling topped with a
roasted hazelnut) and Cerise (a whole cherry in kirsch sealed in
dark chocolate). The chocolates sell for $22.95 a pound ($1.43 an
ounce). About four choice pieces cost a little over $3, or you can
get a small wrapped box of these chocolate jewels for $11.99.

</P>
<P>
   ELEGANT EYE CANDY
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years, San Francisco's Joseph Schmidt Confections has
been making chocolate not only to tantalize the tongue, but to
dazzle the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Each piece is sculpted, molded and hand-colored into dainty,
pleasing shapes, including the company's signature egg truffles. We
found a cute Panda with a delicate red heart for $5 and a trio of
eye-popping heart truffles (one amaretto, one cherry and one Grand
Marnier) for $7.50.

<P>
   SHE SMELLS SEASHELLS
</P>
<P>
   The aroma of Guylian's Belgian chocolate wonders can be
intoxicating. Shaped into delicate, swirling white- and
dark-chocolate-covered shells and sea horses, their smooth praline
centers can be as comforting as a warm bath.
</P>
<P>
   A 4.41-ounce box of 11 pieces sells for about $12. We also found
a mini-box of three chocolates for a mere $1.79.

706-216-3993).

<P>
   A NEW DISCOVERY
</P>
<P>
   Chances are she's never seen this chocolate before. A small
wooden box, sealed with French ribbon, holds the tasty chocolate
morsels from L.A. Burdick Chocolate of Walpole, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Saveur magazine recently extolled the virtues of Burdick's
delectables, which include truffles, tortes and dainty chocolate
mice that arrive with colorful silk tails.
</P>
<P>
   For Valentine's, Burdick's signature wood box with about 16
assorted heart-shaped candies, truffles and mice sells for $22 plus
shipping. You can even order the mice individually for $1.75 a
squeak.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the catch: Burdick, with two stores in Walpole and
Cambridge, Mass., ships only on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two ways you can use these chocolates for
Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who totally forgets to get a gift can call up and ship
these unique beauties as a special way to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   The smarter fella can extend Valentine's. On Sunday, he rewards
his sweetie with dinner or a few flowers. Then, a couple of days
later, a box of chocolate wonders arrives. You can even have
Burdick tuck in a special message with a few tasty chocolate mice.
Perhaps it could read, ``Me and the meeces still love you to
pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Source: L.A. Burdick Chocolate (1-800-229-2419; fax:

overnight.

U.S. INTELLIGENCE MAY HAVE TAPED CLINTON-LEWINSKY CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 and DAVE WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A U.S. intelligence agency may have taped telephone
conversations between President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, and
information about the tapes has been turned over to independent
counsel Kenneth Starr, Sen. Jon Kyl said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The information came to light last week as the Senate considered
evidence in the president's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, a member of the Select Committee on Intelligence, said key
GOP senators were approached by sources who said they knew of the
possible existence of the tapes. The names of those sources were
then turned over to Starr for investigation, Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the development would affect the
impeachment trial, which is scheduled to draw to a close on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are different agencies in the government that make it
their business to tape certain things for certain reasons, and it
was one of those agencies'' that did the taping, Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incidentally, it may have been more than one of those
agencies,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, R-Ariz., refused to identify the agency or agencies
involved in the taping.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I absolutely can't get into in any greater
detail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl said of the sources: ``They are people who claim to have
information about those tapes, who by virtue of who they are have
some credility with respect to the information they have come
forward about.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the sources were members of U.S. intelligence, Kyl
said, ``You can assume that they are people who at some period in
time have been in the employ of the federal government. ''
</P>
<P>
   As for the motive of the sources, Kyl said he believed they were
prompted by the testimony of witnesses in the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you have a case going forward, and at issue are a lot of
different interpretations of phone conversations,`` Kyl said,
mentioning in particular diverging memories about details of events
in the testimony of Lewinsky and presidential friend Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl compared the allegations of the tapes' existence to the
``smoking gun'' evidence in the Watergate scandal, when
congressional witness Alexander Butterfield ``just blurted out'' a
reference to former President Nixon's taping system in the Oval
Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have people who have reason to know that the tapes
exist and they say, `Wait a minute, shouldn't someone know about
this?' '' Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   News reports on Tuesday about the possibility of tapes of
presidential conversations focused on the possiblity of a taping
system in the White House that captured phone calls between Clinton
and Lewinsky, but the White House denied the existence of such a
system.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl was the first to reveal that the conversations had been
recorded by the unidentified intelligence sources.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence, including the CIA, the National Security
Agency and all of the branches of military intelligence, report to
the president and work for the executive branch. The legality of
employees of these agencies informing members of Congress of the
existence of classified material was unclear Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl first revealed the role of the unnamed intelligence services
in his impeachment diary entry for Tuesday, which is published in
today's ``Republic.'' Kyl has been writing the diary for his
grandchildren, and the newspaper has been printing excerpts of the
diary since the impeachment trial of the president began in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public reports are now surfacing about the possibility that a
national security agency may have copies of taped conversations of
White House calls made by or to the president during the times
relevant to this case,'' Kyl wrote. ``I'll have more to say about
this as it is officially dealt with publically.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of turning over the records involving the tapes to
Starr's office apparently originated with a member of the GOP
Senate leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been talking about what to do about this, and I
suggested why don't we turn it over to Starr,'' Assistant Majority
Leader Don Nickles told the Associated Press. ``It's for him to
handle; it's not for us to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   The AP reported that the Republican senators received
information about a week ago, raising the possibility that a White
House taping system might exist. Eager to finish the impeachment
trial, they sent the information to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott told reporters Tuesday that the GOP
senators played no role in the affair other than to receive the
information and pass it on to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've done is make available information sent to me,'' Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv denied the existence of a White
House recording operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not aware of any taping system,'' he told the AP.
</P>
<P>
   Toiv said there are occasional instances in which Clinton will
conduct an interview by phone, and the call is taped to transcribe
the conversation. In some other instances when Clinton speaks to
groups long distance by phone, those calls are taped and
transcribed, he said. &QL;

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ At the very end of watching the upcoming ``The
X-Files'' episode in my office, I took off my headphones and began
to yell, ``Holy ...''
</P>
<P>
   An immediate cry went up from a co-worker: ``DON'T TELL US!''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about it, I won't.
</P>
<P>
   But for fans who have followed this Byzantine show for almost
six seasons, this is the moment you've been waiting for: answers,
and Mulder's vindication.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's ``The X-Files'' movie, integral to understanding the
show this season, was subtitled: ``Fight the Future.'' Well, the
wait is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future is here,'' Mulder says Sunday, ``and all bets are
off.'' The ``perfect conspiracy with an alien race'' is out in the
open. The door was kicked in this past Sunday with the first of a
two-part episode. This Sunday (9 p.m. EST on Fox, check local
listings), Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson)
will come storming through.
</P>
<P>
   You will find the answers, too. To what happened to Mulder's
sister. To the background of the Cigarette Smoking Man (``Smokey's
got a name,'' Mulder says). To the agonizing decision made by
members of the Syndicate. To whether Agent Fowley is working for or
against Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   The last episode was titled ``Two Fathers.'' This coming episode
is called ``One Son.'' On Sunday, Mulder will get what he wants.
But he and the viewers are left with the same question: Now what?
</P>
<P>
   There is a built-in caveat for fans of the show: call it the
Christmas Eve factor. While these conspiracy episodes are
well-executed, expect a letdown. The anticipation is always better.
</P>
<P>
   And here is fodder for debate: Will ``The X-Files'' still be
able to do those offbeat, light episodes it has artfully mixed in,
especially as worldwide cataclysm looms? The show that has built a
lasting legacy by piling on more questions than answers, ``The
X-Files'' is an intriguing position.
</P>
<P>
   The show probably has one more season left after this _
creator/executive producer Chris Carter has said repeatedly seven
years was the goal. And even as more within the FBI believe Mulder
_ at one point he turns skeptic and Scully becomes the conspiracist
_ the agent still has the toughest task left: The future. It's
here. And, yes, all bets are off.

BISCUITS WITH YEAST, REUBEN `SANDWICHES' WITHOUT BREAD (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A number of years ago there was a recipe for angel biscuits
printed in the Star-Telegram, which I cut out and used for many
years, but have since lost it,'' Pat Boyd writes. ``It's a great
recipe (the recipe has yeast in it) and makes delicious biscuits.
Do you or your readers have this recipe?''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a version of the biscuits from ``Country Living Country
Mornings Cookbook'' (Hearst, $23.95), which we ran in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ANGEL BISCUITS
</P>
<P>
   Yields 12
</P>
<P>
   1 package active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees)

   In small bowl, sprinkle the yeast over the water. Stir in sugar
and set aside until mixture is foamy, about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In medium-size bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt. With
pastry blender or 2 knives, cut in butter until mixture resembles
coarse crumbs. Add yeast mixture and milk; mix lightly with fork
until well-combined.
</P>
<P>
   Cover dough with clean cloth and let rise in warm place, away
from drafts, until it doubles in size, about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Grease large baking sheet. On lightly floured surface, with
floured rolling pin, roll dough to 1/2-inch thickness. With floured
3-inch cutter, cut dough into rounds. Place biscuits, 1 inch apart,
on baking sheet. Prick tops with fork. Pat scraps together, reroll,
and cut out more biscuits. Cover dough with clean cloth and let
rise again until double in size, about 45 minutes. Heat oven to 375
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Bake biscuits 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden and firm on top.
Serve warm.

STOCK SHOW DESSERT LADY DOESN'T DISAPPOINT HER FANS (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most popular spots for insiders at the Fort Worth
Stock Show is the horse barn, near the entry to Will Rogers
Coliseum, back where the photographer is set up to take pictures of
all the horse show winners.
</P>
<P>
   A small table is placed in a corner near the main aisle. There's
a coffee pot, a couple of grocery sacks with snacks and usually a
plastic cake or pie holder that contains a Birdie Auerbach dessert.
</P>
<P>
   There is always a certain mystery about Auerbach's desserts.
Kind of a ``What in the world did she make this time?'' question
about the contents of the containers.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach, Stock Show regulars have come to know, can whip up a
dessert from just about anything edible. The Springtown woman has
proved it time and again.
</P>
<P>
   She proved it last year at the Stock Show when she cooked her
pinto bean pie. There were lots of doubters when she announced that
she could make a delicious, sweet pie out of mashed pinto beans,
sugar and coconut, but those doubters evaporated when she handed
out slices.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just to prove it wasn't a fluke, she showed up with
nutcracker pie, a crustless pie that is made with a dozen or so
saltine crackers and a meringue mixture.
</P>
<P>
   It was great.
</P>
<P>
   But this year she one-upped herself. This year she made pinto
beans and saltines look like child's play. This year, while she and
her family worked as security guards at the Stock Show, she came up
with chocolate sauerkraut cake and _ this was the real coup _ a
fruitcake that was actually welcoming to the palate.
</P>
<P>
   It was good!
</P>
<P>
   ``My children wouldn't even lick the bowl,'' she said of her
first effort at the chocolate sauerkraut cake. ``Now, it's their
favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Robert, said he turned his nose up at the mention
of the cake. He really didn't want to taste it. But knowing his
wife's knack for making the impossible possible, he did, and it is
now among his favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Jr. says it is his favorite as well, and when she brought
a sampling to the Stock Show this year, he was at the front of the
line protecting his piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with an old German couple a few years ago,'' Robert
Auerbach said, ``and they told me this recipe was the way German
chocolate cake was originally made _ with sauerkraut instead of
coconut.''
</P>
<P>
   Birdie Auerbach doesn't remember where she got the recipe, but
she said she has had it for years.
</P>
<P>
   The fruitcake recipe is hers. It was one of those improvisations
that occurred when she didn't have enough of this or that and just
used what she had on hand.
</P>
<P>
   She calls it her instant fruitcake because it is made with a
mix. It is not as dense as normal fruitcake, but it is far more
flavorful and edible.
</P>
<P>
   Here are her recipes from this year's Stock Show. Next year,
we're all hoping for her Jack Daniels Chocolate Mousse Pie.

WHO REALLY NEEDS TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE SCANDAL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So the Senate is deliberating the president's fate in secret. So
what?
</P>
<P>
   There must be lots of folks who wish that the entire impeachment
debacle had been conducted in secret. At least that would have
reduced the public's daily intake of indigestible legal palaver and
mind-numbing political prattle.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I'd like to see and hear what's going on behind those
closed chamber doors as the collective judge/jury known as the
United States Senate argues the question of guilt or innocence in
President Clinton's trial on two articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Are senators on either side of the Republican-Democratic divide
``deliberating'' _ the way that an actual jury in an actual trial
would do? Or, more likely, are they simply availing themselves of
the opportunity to dish up some self-serving rhetoric that they can
later repeat for the media and the voters back home?
</P>
<P>
   Interesting? Sort of. Meaningful? Not really.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that most Americans long ago tuned out just about
every aspect of the presidential sex-and-lies scandal _ including
the impeachment proceedings _ and have been waiting impatiently for
the politicians and media to catch up with public opinion on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   One of the opinions expressed most frequently by the public has
been a decided preference for knowing less, not more, about
Clinton's involvement with Monica Lewinksy and his failed attempt
to keep the relationship a secret. Having had it up to here with
the saga of Monica and Bill, plenty of Americans no doubt find
themselves less outraged by Clinton's alleged lawbreaking than by
his incompetence as a cover-up artist.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton had succeeded in his purported efforts to suborn
perjury and obstruct justice, maybe the scandal never would have
happened and the country would have been spared a year's worth of
Monica madness.
</P>
<P>
   It just doesn't seem fair. Here we have Clinton's enemies
claiming that he has covered up crimes from money laundering to
murder, but when his country desperately needs an effective
cover-up, he bungles the whole deal.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we should have impeached him for felonious failure to keep
a secret.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, with the populace already overdosed on public
discussion of the scandal/impeachment _ there are cable TV channels
that talk about it virtually around the clock _ it is highly
improbable that the American people will be upset with the Senate
for ducking behind closed doors to while away the final hours of
the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Any Americans who truly want to know what's being said in those
``secret'' deliberations need not fret. The media hordes will be
waiting right outside the doors to provide instantaneous secondhand
reports of what goes on inside.
</P>
<P>
   The only aspect of all this that might be more predictable than
the eventual acquittal of the president is the post-deliberation
parade of senators quoting themselves in the pursuit of historical
perspective and elevated approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing that is said during the deliberations, of course, is
expected to affect the verdict of the senatorial judge/jury _
although the anti-Clinton forces are obviously hoping that the
enforced freedom of a secret discussion will somehow instill in
Democrats a sense of outrage toward the president that can be
assuaged only by a vote of ``guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   This is more than an uphill battle: To convict the president and
remove him from office, pro-removal senators must drum up a
two-thirds majority _ 67 votes if all 100 members are accounted for
_ on at least one of the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Locking the doors and shooing away the TV cameras cannot make
such a vote achievable. Anyone who believes otherwise is hereby
awarded the Wishful Thinker of the Year Award.
</P>
<P>
   We've seen and heard the endless media overkill. We've seen and
heard the redundant pleading and cajoling by the president's
prosecutors and defenders. We will surely survive without seeing
and hearing the final huffs and puffs of the Senate.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's no secret that college campuses today are wired, with
high-speed Internet hookups in dormitory rooms, online applications
and distance-learning programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Gettysburg College (www.gettysburg.edu), a private liberal
arts college with 2,200 students in Gettysburg, Pa., has taken the
electronic campus a step further by allowing students and parents
access to an interactive Web-based system that tracks and links
many aspects of college life.
</P>
<P>
   The system, called the College Navigation Project, was started
about a year ago as a way to link students to one another and to a
wide array of campus information, like financial records, grades
and course descriptions. A version for parents was added at the end
of October.
</P>
<P>
   Students can customize the College Navigation Project to meet
their own needs. Don Redman, a Web programmer and analyst with the
project, compares the system to a ``giant puzzle builder.''
</P>
<P>
   Students can feed the system different bits of information about
themselves, their studies, career goals or personal interests to
create a student profile, he said. That dossier is then matched
with information about courses, campus events, faculty members,
internships _ and even other students.
</P>
<P>
   The system can even act as a counselor, analyzing the courses a
student has done well in and suggesting ways to build on academic
and career strengths. ``We made the conceptual jump from basic Web
pages to a smart machine,'' said Mike Martys, vice provost for
information resources at Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   Gettysburg programmers say that customization sets the College
Navigation Project apart from Web systems at other colleges.
``Other schools are publishing information on the Net,'' Redman
said, ``but as far as we know, we're about the only ones taking it
to the next step by making it personally useful.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, students who need rides out of town for the weekend
can tell the system where they want to go, when they want to leave
and how close they need to get to their destinations. The system
will try to find them rides, sending e-mail to notify students of
matches.
</P>
<P>
   The project also makes available course archives. The college
maintains an annotated record of the 600 courses offered each
semester. Through the project site, visitors can pull up a vivid
description of what a class was like 3, 5 or even 12 years ago,
complete with its syllabus, the students who took it and comments
from students or teachers. ``It's really a snapshot in time,''
Redman said.
</P>
<P>
   The College Navigation Project was designed and built in the
past three years at a cost of about $250,000 and is used regularly
by 78 percent of enrolled students, Martys estimated. Ninety
percent of the students have active system accounts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many other colleges and universities are taking steps to use
Internet technology to link systems, students and former students.
Cornell University (www.cornell.edu), for example, is in the
process of changing its Bear Access campus network software into
Web-enabled software that will expand the system's offerings and
access, said Steven Worona, an assistant to the vice president for
information technologies at Cornell, which has 20,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   The school already gives all new students a personal e-mail
address, which they can keep and use for life.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Access was created with tools from Project Mandarin
(www.mandarin.org), a software consortium of 32 colleges. Many
consortium members have collaborated to create their own electronic
campus information services, like Pennsylvania State University's
Oasis (Open Access to Student Information Systems), the University
of Arizona's UAInfo, the University of Michigan's Wolverine Access
and Washington State University's WSU Infonet.
</P>
<P>
   At Gettysburg, parents were invited to set up College Navigation
Project accounts because students were giving their personal log-on
names and passwords to their families. ``We would see an on-campus
sign-on, and then minutes later, the same ID would be signing on
from another location far away,'' Martys said. ``Our security
system would flag it each time.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents' version of the system was introduced at a family
weekend at the campus last fall. School officials say they have 132
active parent accounts and more than 200 applications for accounts
from interested parents.
</P>
<P>
   There is one caveat: parents cannot get access at all unless
their children agree to it. Parents and children have to agree on
exactly what parents have access to.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law protects the privacy of student education records,
including many of those that can be viewed through the College
Navigation Project. While the Federal Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act gives parents certain rights with respect to their
children's education records, those rights transfer to the student
when the student reaches age 18 or attends any post-secondary
school.
</P>
<P>
   Martys said students' privacy had been an important issue in the
development of the system. Students can regulate what information
concerning them that others can see by turning various menus on or
off _ and they can change their choices daily.
</P>
<P>
   Students have generally chosen to be very open with one another
but wary of giving outsiders full access to personal information,
Martys said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of parents' peering into their children's lives on
campus also raises some interesting questions, Gettysburg officials
and others concede. ``We are wondering if there are battles brewing
over who gets to see what,'' Martys said, jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   One Gettysburg parent, David Frohlich of Rochester, called the
college's system ``a great aid to communication.'' His 18-year-old
son, Michael, is a freshman majoring in political science at
Gettysburg and is in the college's choir. To get details about a
holiday concert on campus, Frohlich and his wife, Laraine, were
able to tap into the College Navigation Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us the ability to check on things ourselves without
having to bug him,'' Frohlich said. ``We're five and a half hours
away. We want to be involved, but we don't want to be intrusive.''
</P>
<P>
   Course descriptions in the system are much more comprehensive
than the small paragraphs typically found in class-schedule
directories, Frohlich added. ``There's a tremendous amount of
detail, so it allows us to have input on what he may be choosing,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gettysburg recognized the desire on the part of people
other than just students wanting this information and that giving
it to a much larger audience would be a wise trend,'' Frohlich
added. ``I think it's going to turn out to be a tremendous tool.''

   Fed up with hearing about the glories of the Internet? Fed up
with watching your sister-in-law get rich investing in tiny
Internet companies you just (italics)know(end italics) will tank
any day? Fed up with Pollyannas singing the economy's praises even
as your boss kicks you in the shin?
</P>
<P>
   Or, perhaps, simply fed up?
</P>
<P>
   Well, never fear _ there are Web sites for you, too.
</P>
<P>
   What's your pleasure (or pain)? Are you disgusted, in despair or
merely disgruntled?
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled, you say? Then hie thee to Disgruntled and get it
out of your system (www.disgruntled.com). There you'll find ``an
online magazine that combines news, feature, satire and commentary
about the darker side of the world of work.''
</P>
<P>
   The site's creator, Daniel S. Levine, writes, ``I invite all
takers to use these pages to vent and tell their tales of horror,
disgust, frustration, liberation and revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   At last! Spill out, sweet rage! You start typing your particular
horror story _ you're really on a roll _ and sure enough, there
comes your boss, looking for a reason to kick your other shin.
Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   But never fear. Disgruntled has imagined this exact scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are reading Disgruntled at work and your boss is
heading your way, just hit the Boss button'' _ a green frowny face,
complete with cigar. Click on it, and up pops a screen headed:
``Our mission is to increase shareholder value,'' followed by a
list of revenue figures. (Hmmm. If you're a writer or artist on
deadline, that might not cut it.)
</P>
<P>
   Now click on Readers' Tales, where the categories include Around
the Water Cooler, Family Business, Fed Up, Getting Even, Getting
Gruntled, Inhuman Relations, Temporary Insanity and Work Is
Hazardous to Your Health.
</P>
<P>
   Getting even. That sounds juicy.
</P>
<P>
   Did some workplace nightmare drive Levine to create this site?
Not really. ``Listening to some of the horror stories,'' he said in
a telephone interview, ``I've come to realize I've been fairly
fortunate in my work experience.'' Then again, when asked about his
worst job, he said, ``I guess in some ways they all were.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine, 37, a freelance business writer based near Berkeley,
Calif., started the site three years ago, he said, because ``when I
pitched a story from the perspective of employees, editors weren't
interested.'' But in his reporting, he said, he found ``people on
all rungs of the ladder increasingly expressing frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   The site, basically a one-person operation, carries some
advertising, from Amazon.com and others, but it is no moneymaker.
``The revenues,'' Levine said, ``have gone from negligible to
insignificant.'' So where can Levine _ whose book ``Disgruntled:
The Darker Side of the World of Work'' (Putnam) was published last
fall _ vent his own disgruntlement? ``At myself,'' he said with a
laugh, ``for not paying myself enough.''
</P>
<P>
   If you still don't feel better after exploring his site, click
on this link: Feeling De-Motivated? Click Here to Show It. And you
soon find yourself at Despair Inc., which says it employs or works
with ``a wide variety of writers, designers, programmers and
fulfillment personnel, all of whom remain hopelessly dissatisfied
with their jobs, their relationships and their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This chronic state of frustration guarantees that the fruits
of their labor won't be diluted with hope, sentiment or good
cheer,'' it adds.
</P>
<P>
   Here you can order Despair Wear _ T-shirts, say, with messages
like ``I found the cure for hope'' or ``Another dissatisfied
customer.'' And there's a Despair calendar, with Jan. 12 listed as
the Procrastinators' New Year's.
</P>
<P>
   But what if you want to up the ante, to progress from
disgruntled to despair and downright disgusted?
</P>
<P>
   Too late. These folks must have taken their name to heart and
packed it in. ``For Sale: www.disgusted.com,'' the screen says.
``This domain may be available for your project!''

<P>
   HAMPTON, N.H. _ ``Probably the greatest public relations coup in
the history of humanity was the Shakers convincing the rest of the
world that they made good chairs,'' Michael Dunbar is telling a
shopful of would-be Windsor chair makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaker chairs are terribly uncomfortable,'' he continues while
drawing a chair with a back at 90 degrees to the seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave found a picture a while ago of a Shaker dining room,'' he
adds, referring to his assistant Dave Wachnicki, ``and they didn't
have Shaker chairs _ they had Windsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're out selling these to the rest of us!''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Dunbar's shop, the country's only full-time school
for Windsor chair making. If you can't afford an icon of the
American antiques world, you can learn to build one. In five days,
Dunbar, 51, will teach 11 students to do just that, in a class that
is fun but intense. It gets rolling the first day with riving, or
splitting, wood from oak logs with an ax and an old tool called a
froe. Then the chair's arm and bow are shaped with drawknife, plane
and spokeshave before being steamed for 15 minutes and then bent
around a form and put aside to dry.
</P>
<P>
   The students come from across the country: engineers, doctors,
drywallers, teachers, carpenters and the occasional journalist.
(One missed a plane because security guards mistook his spoon bits
_ the chair maker's answer to drill bits _ for bullets.) Many will
complain of sore muscles and sleepless nights, waking up at 3 a.m.
wondering if the chair will really come together or if the mistakes
they have already made will prove fatal. There may be no dustbin of
history in the shop, but there is a wood-burning stove that is even
more unforgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar's infatuation with Windsors _ he calls it ``a hobby that
got out of hand'' _ began when he was studying French at Worchester
State College and fully intending to teach it eventually. He saw a
Windsor at a yard sale and has been in love ever since.
</P>
<P>
   He started making chairs full time in 1973. After almost a
decade, he began to offer classes occasionally. A self-taught
woodworker, he is the author of seven books and something of a guru
to many hand-tool enthusiasts _ a Norm Abram without power cords.
It was not until 1994 that he and his wife, Sue, began running the
classes by themselves here near the New Hampshire coast, working
their way up to the current 23 one-week classes a year, each
student paying $600. The class has evolved over the years, with
Dunbar offering mea culpas for past sins, like telling people to
dry tenons in hot sand, something he now feels the need to
constantly apologize for.
</P>
<P>
   During one class, the assistants included Wachnicki, a
dentist/woodworker (what George Washington wouldn't have given for
a guy like this!) and a 1995 inductee into Dunbar's own Chair
Making Hall of Fame. An intern helps out _ Dan Hein, a Wisconsin
computer teacher. After he was seen putting the end of a chair leg
into his mouth to wet it before a test fit, making the fit that
much tighter, he won his second Hall of Fame nomination. This
little gimmick Dunbar calls the ``Hein Lick Maneuver.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,500 people have taken a Windsor chair class with
Dunbar, and he estimates that 10 percent of them are making chairs
commercially, at least part time.
</P>
<P>
   The first Windsor chairs were developed in England between 1710
and 1720, says Nancy Goyne Evans, the author of ``American Windsor
Chairs'' (Hudson Hills, 1996). The chairs are called Windsors, she
adds, because ``it was on the grounds of Windsor Castle where this
rustic furniture was first placed.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Heritage College Dictionary defines a Windsor as
``a wooden chair having a high spoked back, outward-slanting legs
connected by crossbars, and a saddle seat.'' But Ms. Evans says
``the critical element'' is the seat, which is made of a thick
piece of wood, allowing the upper and lower structures to work
independently of each other.
</P>
<P>
   The early Windsors were the period equivalent of Adirondack
chairs, she says, and probably had plank seats. They were the
replacements for cane-seated chairs, which were on the wane.
</P>
<P>
   By 1736, Windsors had arrived in Philadelphia, Ms. Evans says,
and the desire ``to keep up with the Joneses'' was enough to
support craftsmen capable of copying the chairs. In the mid-1700s a
high-back Windsor was still a chair for the well-to-do. But after
the Revolution, the Windsor became the most common seating form in
America. A visitor to Monticello in Jefferson's day would have
found Windsors.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the style was to paint most Windsors green. But
painting them was, and is, more than just a question of fashion _
for early makers of Windsors a key question was, If you are going
to paint a chair green anyway, why waste time and money on
expensive, hard-to-work woods that won't be seen?
</P>
<P>
   The Windsors made in a class last July used maple legs and some
maple parts for the back, a pine seat one-and-three-quarters inches
thick, red oak riven from logs for the spindles, one-piece arm and
bow and some small cherry parts for arm extensions _ a variety of
woods that cries out for camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   Where an early Windsor was built, Ms. Evans says, can sometimes
be determined by the types of wood used. Philadelphia makers, for
example, used yellow poplar for the seats, but pine was more common
from Rhode Island north. Hickory was a popular wood for spindles,
but oak and other woods were also used.
</P>
<P>
   Some contemporary makers have opted for all-hardwood
construction, which allows the texture and beauty of wood to be
accented, but, Dunbar contends, ``If somebody makes you a Windsor
chair with a hardwood seat, he's made you a bad chair.'' He thinks
the legs and spindles fit better in the softer pine, but that's up
for debate.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Rodriguez, who has made plenty of Windsors himself and
teaches woodworking at the Fashion Institute of Technology in
Manhattan, also prefers pine for the seat, but not because of any
inherent flaws in hardwood seats _ it simply takes, he says, four
or five times as long to carve a hardwood like curly maple or
burled walnut. Why? ``Because the grains are so convoluted,''
Dunbar says.
</P>
<P>
   Even pine can be hard to carve. The seat Dunbar is using as a
class model had such swirly, difficult-to-work grain that he
concludes it was from a ``miserable tree'' that ``deserved to
die.''
</P>
<P>
   A chair made with rectangular or square mortise-and-tenon joints
can loosen over time as torque is applied by twisting, turning and
leaning back _ all of the things your mother told you not to do.
Sitting in a Windsor made to Dunbar's specifications actually
tightens leg joints that may have come unglued. The legs use a
locking taper _ bigger at the bottom, smaller at the top _ to fit
into the seat, so it is solid and tight even before glue and wedges
are added. The joint is fitted under compression to keep it
together; if the glue fails, the joint still holds.
</P>
<P>
   The materials fail before the joinery. ``Hundreds of thousands
of 200-year-old Windsors are still as tight as the day they were
made,'' Dunbar says.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But if the beauty of natural wood is removed from the chair
maker's consideration, how does a craftsman make an appealing
chair? Windsor chair makers relied on line. The chair makers pull
the viewer's eye up quickly through the back spindles into the
heavy line that makes the bow of the back. The heavy line then
accelerates the eye and eventually pulls it down into the rest of
the chair. Rounding the edge makes the thick seat, needed for
strength, appear much thinner.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar now buys the legs and some back parts preturned. But
instead of using relatively expensive dimensioned hardwood from a
lumberyard, he buys a much cheaper red oak log and rives the wood
for the spindles, arm and bow _ a log 18 inches in diameter will
supply wood for about 50 chairs and costs him less than $100. These
parts are all made using wet wood and traditional tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The making of a spindle,'' Dunbar says, ``is like what
Michelangelo said about a block of marble. You envision a sculpture
that's in there and then you take away everything that's not part
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   While students might take half an hour or more to make a
spindle, Dunbar can do one in about five minutes. An entire chair
takes him less than 10 hours and sells for $700 with a finish, $650
without.
</P>
<P>
   Carving the seat is where the strangest tools come into play _
strange for modern times, but once common. After cutting the basic
oval with a bow saw, Dunbar turns to the gutter adze, which looks
something like a pickax, with a sharp, curved edge designed to
remove large chunks of wood quickly. ``You don't swing the gutter
adze where your feet are,'' he advises. He appears to have all of
his toes, buried though they are in sweat socks on which he wipes
voluminous amounts of Elmer's white glue as it leaks out of joints.
</P>
<P>
   After the adze has done the rough removal, a scorp is used to
clean up the surface. Then a compass plane cleans up after the
scorp, and a travisher _ a curved spokeshave _ cleans up after the
compass plane. Then sanding. A drawknife and spokeshave shape and
smooth the outside of the seat, leaving a much sought-after
hand-crafted look.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to boring holes, many students have used angle
gauges and the assistance of another student in an attempt to get
the 45 holes in a sack back drilled at just the right angle, only
to miss by several degrees. Dunbar will walk up, eyeball the
correct angle, and when students check it, find that he has hit it
on the button. Students think of him as a human protractor.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings Dunbar back to those Shaker chairs he says are
so uncomfortable, and to his first official Windsor chair joke:
</P>
<P>
   ``A duck walks into a Windsor chair shop and says to the chair
maker, `Got any Shaker chairs?'

   Love American style is fast, fast, fast.
</P>
<P>
   Who has time to canoodle between work, soccer practice, the
school play, the extra-credit science project, the hairdresser
appointment, the teeth cleaning, getting the oil changed, waiting
for the cable guy, buying groceries? Forget the time _ who has the

</P>
<P>
   But this year, Valentine's Day is Sunday, giving you all day to
prepare, with love, a feast for two. Here, we offer three menus
from which to choose, each paired with a side dish and matched
divinely with a bottle of wine. Choose duck with rice and crisp
green beans, rack of lamb with a spice-and-pepper crust, or
sensuous mussels, cooked in a sauce of Calvados, apple cider and
cream.
</P>

   Duck is a grown-up treat. Because of the ratio of meat-to-bone,
one duck is not enough to feed a family, but for two diners, it's
perfect. Pair the rich meat with savory rice and simple green
beans.

<P>
   COLONIAL ROAST DUCK WITH WILD RICE STUFFING
</P>
<P>
   Serves 2
</P>
<P>
   4- to 5-pound duck

</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon turmeric
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon grated orange peel
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon ground coriander
</P>
<P>
   2 breakfast sausage links
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup minced onion
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup minced peeled apple
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon rubbed sage
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon thyme leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cooked wild rice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Wash duck, remove and discard
giblets (or cook them for the cat). Pat dry. Cut any excess fat
around cavity. Combine salt, pepper, sugar, turmeric, orange peel
and coriander. Season the duck heavily inside and out with the
mixture. Place duck on rack in roasting pan; cook 15 minutes, while
making stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   Fry sausage links over medium heat in small pan. When sausage is
crispy and brown, remove to paper towel. Drain off all but 1
teaspoon fat from pan, then add minced onion, apple, parsley, sage
and thyme to pan. Reduce heat to low and cook for 2 minutes,
stirring regularly. Mince sausage, place in large bowl with cooked
wild rice, fresh bread crumbs and apple/onion mixture. Break egg in
small bowl, mix briefly with milk, then add to stuffing mix along
with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Toss to coat.
</P>
<P>
   When duck has cooked for 15 minutes, remove from oven and lower
heat to 325 degrees. Spoon stuffing into duck cavity; tie legs shut
with a string, if desired. Roast for 2 hours at 325 degrees. Duck
bastes itself; just drain off fat that accumulates in bottom of pan
a few times during the cooking process. When the 2 hours is up,
remove duck from oven and let stand 10 minutes. Remove stuffing
from cavity to serving plates. Cut duck in half with a sharp, heavy
knife or cleaver. Cut carefully through breast along one side of
bones. Spread 2 halves out and cut along both sides of back bones,
discarding back bones.

<P>
   This wine bears a familiar name, Mouton Cadet, but it is
something quite new. This is 1994 Mouton Cadet Reserve, a $12 blend
of red grapes _ cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and merlot _
from the Medoc region of Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   This wine stayed at the winery longer than the usual cadet, for
extra wood aging. The wine has a complex flavor with dried cherry
and red currant in the forefront. As will happen with Bordeaux
blends, it hides behind a light curtain of tannin. But that will
disappear in time, and even now it is neutralized when the wine is
drunk with food.
</P>
<P>
   Mouton Cadet Reserve is also good with roast beef and
soft-ripened cheeses such as brie.

<P>
   DOYLESTOWN, Pa. _ At 1 p.m., on a dreary Thursday afternoon last
week, the faithful gathered at the red brick First Baptist Church
in this Bucks County town for a special prayer service. They were
here not to ask for help achieving world peace or curing cancer,
but rather to seek God's help to smite the Year 2000 computer
problem.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second of dozens of prayer gatherings and seminars
scheduled this year by the Central Bucks Evangelical Churches. The
group of 16 churches lists it as a goal to educate their
parishioners and to ask God to give humankind the knowledge to
solve the millennium bug problem, which could cause computers'
internal clocks and the chips embedded in VCRs and the like to
become confused by the date 2000. (Technology experts disagree as
to whether the problems will be slightly inconvenient or
disastrous.)
</P>
<P>
   The dozen people who gathered last Thursday afternoon and the 25
more who came to another Doylestown church that evening were asking
God to make their government leaders give truthful information
about the Year 2000 problem, to help foreign countries solve their
Year 2000 problems and to minimize the consequences for the elderly
and for needy segments of society.
</P>
<P>
   Two ministers, Bob Travis of the First Baptist Church and Dan
Collison of Doylestown Community Fellowship, ran the services. They
recommended ``spiritual preparation,'' like repenting for sins and
praying, and ``physical preparation,'' like getting hard copies of
personal and financial records and stockpiling food and water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are middle of the road,'' Collison said. ``We are not
saying this is the end of civilization and to head for the hills.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither minister sees the problem as God's plan of disaster and
chaos predicted in Revelation, or as any other biblical sign. This
is ``man-made'' said Collison, who has a private Web-site design
business and also gives updated Y2K information on the church's Web
site (www.dcf.org).
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Brasher, an assistant professor of religion and
philosophy at Mount Union College in Alliance, Ohio, said: ``For a
variety of Christian groups, there has been a growing concern about
Y2K, but the bulk of Christians do not look at Y2K as fulfilling a
Revelation prophecy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brasher, who is on the advisory board of the Center for
Millennial Studies at Boston University (www.mille.org), which is
looking into societal responses to the turn of the millennium, said
that in recent months she had received calls from pastors around
the country asking her to speak to their congregations or tell them
more about Y2K that they could share with followers.
</P>
<P>
   Barb O'Neill of Yardley, Pa., attended last Thursday's service
in Doylestown to pray and to gather information she could take back
to her Bucks County church, which had not yet started discussing
Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   The service opened with Collison announcing that ``we're here to
pray about Y2K, not to create fearmongering.'' Then they sang
hymns, clapped to music and prayed, while several Philadelphia
television stations stuck cameras in people's faces.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall behind the altar, the date of the service was
projected with a message: 330 days left.

NEW YORK WASTE LEVEL TROUBLES VIRGINIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLES CITY, Va. _ English settlers first cleared the land at
Shirley Plantation in 1615, five years before the Pilgrims sailed
for the New World.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson was married nearby, while Robert E. Lee spent
much of his youth at this stately manse on the banks of the James
River.
</P>
<P>
   Next door to this historic locale, Houston-based Waste
Management will begin offloading up to 3,900 tons of garbage a
week, much of it barged in from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter family, which has owned the plantation east of
Richmond for 11 generations, supports the project. But much of the
rest of the Old Dominion is up in arms.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by the thought of their genteel Virginia becoming an
increasingly important dumping ground for Gotham's garbage,
lawmakers in Richmond are hustling through a series of new bills to
restrict the transport and disposal of solid waste in the
commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   But Waste Management may be able to dodge a more devastating
development, a reigniting of a national debate over interstate
movements of trash, no small issue for the nation's largest garbage
hauler.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Virginia, the District of Columbia and seven other
area states launched a major inspection of garbage trucks rolling
through the region. And now, pressure is growing on Capitol Hill to
grant states the right to control the amount of trash that crosses
their borders.
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management, in part, has become a victim of regional
politics, as New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Virginia Gov. Jim
Gilmore engaged in the worst rancor between the North and the South
since the fall of Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to revive the Civil War,'' says Shirley
Plantation heir Charles Carter.
</P>
<P>
   But the company can credit its own missteps, from excessive
dumping to improper transport of medical waste, for many of its
problems here in the Piedmont.
</P>
<P>
   The trash debate stems from New York's decision to close the
city's colorfully named Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island by
2002.
</P>
<P>
   The city has hired contractors such as Waste Management to
export the trash elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In stepped Waste Management, which, following Houston-based USA
Waste Services' purchase of Oakbrook, Ill.'s Waste Management,
boasted 304 landfill sites.
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management, which operates five of Virginia's seven
largest landfill sites, won a contract to handle 2,400 tons of
Brooklyn trash a day. That work was in addition to the numerous
commercial contracts the company already has with New York
apartment buildings, restaurants and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia was already the nation's second-largest trash importer,
taking in an estimated 2.8 million tons of trash _ mostly from New
York _ in 1997, according to a study last year by the Congressional
Research Service.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia's importation of trash had grown by more than a million
tons in less than two years. And residents here feared the closing
of Fresh Kills would mean an even more dramatic influx of new trash
into the commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management transports New York trash by truck and rail to
three Virginia landfills, as well as to several other states from
Ohio to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which had unloaded trash at a temporary port
adjacent to the Shirley Plantation for years, won approval to build
a new, $20 million facility at the site dubbed Port Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   When the port opens later this spring or early summer, the
trash, which will be transported in specialized containers mandated
by the commonwealth, will be loaded onto trucks for the road trip
to a county-owned landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management leases the property, which was once part of the
Shirley Plantation, from the Carter family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of the James River, for basically four centuries,
is one of commerce,'' Carter argues. ``It was the nation's first
highway. ... The notion we need to preserve everything and not do
anything new is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter also has a financial incentive _ the need to pay the
inheritance taxes when his parents die to keep the estate in the
family. He already pays more than $40,000 a year for life insurance
for his parents, so he can collect a payment large enough when they
die to handle the death taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mission is simple: Preserve, protect and pass on the
plantation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen miles up the road, pearl-gray seagulls circle and dive
into the trash heap at the Charles City Landfill, while
steel-wheeled vehicles grind and crush the collected debris.
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management dumps about 3,500 tons of garbage into the
landfill each day, about half the 6,900 tons allowed under the
county permit.
</P>
<P>
   For rural counties like Charles City, such large, regional
landfills are money-makers. Waste Management pays the county
government for every ton of trash dumped at the site, while also
providing garbage services for local residents.
</P>
<P>
   For companies like Waste Management, the issue of landfill
dumping is economics. The company makes a profit by winning
contracts in cities like New York to take trash and then disposing
of that waste in a company-run landfill. New York is providing a
new source of trash, while Charles City has the capacity to take
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economics of garbage and the politics of garbage are two
totally separate issues,'' said Marc Sulam, an analyst with
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials say Virginia, by creating large regional
landfills, has been able to consolidate trash dumping into
substantially fewer, more environmentally controlled sites. And
they point out that if greater restrictions are imposed on dumping,
consumers will pay for those regulations through higher fees.
</P>
<P>
   Americans generated 210 million tons of solid waste in 1997,
with the typical person producing about 4 1/2 pounds a day,
according to the U.S. Industry &AMP; Trade Outlook '99.
</P>
<P>
   While the nation's consumers are often chastised for our
disposable society ``Americans produce little solid waste relative
to the country's total economic output,'' the study asserts.
</P>
<P>
   While Virginia's trash import volumes have been on the rise,
Pennsylvania ranks _ far and away _ as the nation's largest trash
importer.
</P>
<P>
   The furor in Virginia might well have died down, if not for the
comments of New York's less-than-tactful chief executive, Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the ``great benefits'' the nation enjoys from New
York as a cultural and business center, Giuliani suggested the rest
of country owed it to the Big Apple to take some of its trash.
``This is a reciprocal relationship,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia's Gilmore shot back, saying he was ``offended'' by
Giuliani's comments.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times editorial page, referring to Virginia's
concerns about becoming ``Fresh Kills South,'' noted that
``Virginia's solemn insult has about as much sting as an air kiss
in New York's City Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all enjoy the banter,'' the paper added, ``but if Mr.
Giuliani is going to offend every statehouse, we'll have to secede
from this country. Then where will we put the garbage?''
</P>
<P>
   Even Katie Couric, the ``Today'' show's co-host and a Virginia
native, got into the act, blasting _ and then later apologizing _
to Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management, for its own part, has contributed to the
public relations debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, the company was forced to halt barging operations
next to Shirley Plantation after Coast Guard officials noticed
``trash juice'' leaking from the garbage barges. Waste Management
was ordered to use new, more leak-proof containers to transport
barges up the river.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, a subcontractor-operated tractor trailer
hauling garbage from New York to a Waste Management-operated
landfill in Virginia crashed in the Chesapeake Bay Bridge Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   The truck, the investigation revealed, was carrying not just
household trash but medical waste _ including syringes, catheters,
bloody sheets and other hospital debris _ as well, materials not
permitted in the company-operated landfill sites.
</P>
<P>
   Since Waste Management is responsible for screening waste dumped
at its landfill sites, the Virginia Department of Environmental
Quality ordered the Houston company to pay a $70,000 fine and spend
another $55,000 to produce two training videos.
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management exceeded the daily dumping limit of 4,800 tons
at the King George County Landfill east of Fredericksburg, Va., 22
times last October and November.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contended this excess dumping came just as lawmakers
started talking about limiting dumping in the commonwealth's
landfills at 1998 levels.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Schotsch, Waste Management's district manager at the
site, said the excess dumping was caused by an unexpected surge in
volumes and difficulty in coordinating truck and rail deliveries.
The problem was corrected before King George County officials sent
the company a notice ordering them to stop the excessive dumping,
company officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In this political climate, Virginia Commonwealth Sen. Bill
Bolling _ with the support of the governor _ has proposed
legislation that would limit dumping in the state's landfills to
2,000 tons per day or at 1998 levels, whichever is greater.
</P>
<P>
   Bolling argues caps like those Charles City has placed on its
landfill are virtually meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might as well not have any cap at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another bill would ban the barging of trash on Virginia
waterways. The Virginia attorney general's office has issued an
opinion arguing that such a bill would pass Constitutional muster,
but it would likely face an immediate court challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the debate, Waste Management's ``attitude on this
whole thing has been one of `Stick it in your eye,' '' Bolling
said, adding ``I think that's ruffled a few feathers.''
</P>
<P>
   While at least some kind of legislation is likely to be signed
into law, state efforts to control the importation of trash have
been thrown out repeatedly by the courts over the last two decades.
That's because the Interstate Commerce Clause of the U.S.
Constitution gives Congress, not the states, the authority to
regulate commerce across state lines.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, over the last decade, has considered numerous bills to
restrict waste shipments across state lines but has failed to enact
any legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Paul Gillmor, R-Ohio _ no relation to Virginia's governor _
introduced legislation last month that would grant states the right
to limit the amount of trash that crosses their borders.
</P>
<P>
   Such a bill would be debated in the House Commerce Committee,
which is headed by Virginia Republican Tom Bliley of Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   But Bliley, the former mayor of Richmond, pushed a compromise
bill a few years ago that would have given states greater control
over trash movements, only to see the legislation die on the House
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bliley says the nation's governors will have to reach some
kind of consensus on the issue before he'll go to bat on another
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interstate wars over garbage have been going on for quite
some time,'' said Leone Young, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney
in New York. ``They flare up in different places. ... It's really
nothing new. It's just a different location.''

   DALLAS _ A child is being heckled while looking for a seat on a
school bus. Six kids have room in their seats, but none of them
will let him sit down.
</P>
<P>
   This scene is out nearly daily across the country. Maybe the kid
is being excluded because he's fat or wears glasses; maybe it's
because she's African-American or doesn't speak English.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, children can heap much pain on one another, pointing
out the differences that separate them.
</P>
<P>
   But is this scenario fodder for a crash course on prejudice and
discrimination? And should that course take place at, of all
things, a children's museum?
</P>
<P>
   Despite some community resistance, executives at The Science
Place think so.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the museum has been known as a venue for illustrating
principles in mathematics and science, not for engineering social
justice. But in perhaps their most controversial hands-on exhibit
to date, museum officials are planning on doing just that. By
giving patrons an up-close view of discrimination, they hope to
change the way people, children particularly, interact with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of designers at the Chicago Children's Museum,
``Face to Face: Dealing With Prejudice and Discrimination'' will
open Saturday and run through May 30.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, aimed at children ages 7 to 12, explores
stereotyping, name-calling and exclusion through interactive videos
and role-playing exercises. It is designed to provide children and
their families with the tools needed to help them recognize and
respond to prejudice and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the Kid's Bridge video, children hear other
children talk about how they have been discriminated against and
how they felt about the experience. In another activity, visitors
write hurtful names on a slip of paper and then feed it into a
paper shredder.
</P>
<P>
   Due primarily to the controversial nature of the exhibit, Mac
Sudduth, president and chief executive officer of The Science
Place, said raising advance money has been a challenge. To date,
the museum has brought in only half the funds its leaders had hoped
for. Although ticket sales will help to support the
$10,000-per-month price tag of the exhibit, Sudduth says tickets
can't be counted on to carry the full cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the museum is financed primarily through ticket
sales,'' he said. ``But it's hard to count on increased ticket
sales because of the controversial nature of the exhibit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudduth said he is not surprised by the community's comparative
lack of interest in this exhibit, because people often don't want
to admit that discrimination is still a major societal problem.
And, he said, ``even people of good faith can have differences of
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that one potential donor told him, ``She could not be
involved in something that even talked about name-calling because
it encourages people to call people names.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudduth also says some people have ``said in private that they
don't think this is the way to address the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Although discrimination may seem an unusual topic for The
Science Place, Sudduth said that it fits within the organization's
mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our jobs is to better serve the community,'' Sudduth
said. ``That includes getting women and minorities to understand
that they too can do science and math.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, people who harbor prejudices or face
discrimination often suffer from health problems such as
hypertension. The museum's Hall of Health and Medicine focuses on
such issues.
</P>
<P>
   Sudduth, who has not seen the exhibit, said ``Face to Face'' was
brought to the museum's attention by Janice Westbrook, a volunteer
coordinator for the Family Friends Project in Dallas, who saw it
during a visit to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook said she thought the exhibit could help with ongoing
racial tensions and tensions related to gender and disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, in this city we have a lot of issues that need to
be dealt with,'' she said. ``If we were doing a good job (of
educating people) we wouldn't need this exhibit, but we're not
doing a good job.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is one of 10 cities that ``Face to Face'' will travel to
this year before becoming a permanent fixture at its birthplace in
Chicago, where it has also met with controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Lach, public relations manager of the Chicago
Children's Museum, said reaction to the exhibit has been mixed.
Most of the criticism, she said, centered on the Prejudice Bus part
of the exhibit, in which unpleasant epithets are hurled at patrons
as they walk through. Once off the bus, visitors watch a video
showing how to handle such situations in real life.
</P>
<P>
   Although the actual bus will remain in Chicago, in Dallas kids
will have a similar experience by listening to a list of derogatory
names via a telephone and then learning some appropriate responses,
such as walking away.
</P>
<P>
   Lach says ``Face to Face'' can't provide all the answers for
kids, ``but we hope conversations are started and continued in the
classroom and at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sudduth said, he thinks the real opportunity for the
exhibit may be with parents, who will learn a range of options for
helping their kids deal with situations in which they feel
excluded.
</P>
<P>
   And that, he believes, is important for all families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Face to Face'' may eat into the museum's resources, he says,
but ``we've said we're going to bring it here, and we're going to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Face to Face: Dealing with Prejudice and Discrimination'' will
be open Feb. 13 through May 30 at The Science Place in Fair Park;
9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Sunday through Saturday. General admission
is $6 for adults, $3 for children, but group rates are available.

GOP HEAVY-HITTERS URGE BUSH TO RUN FOR PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of prominent Republicans Wednesday called
Texas Gov. George W. Bush the party's best shot to recapture the
White House and urged him run for the presidency next year.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty former and current Republican members of Congress signed a
``Draft Bush 2000 Committee'' letter encouraging the governor to
announce his candidacy quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush is the best candidate,'' said former Rep.
Gerald B.H. Solomon of New York, chairman of the move to draft
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``With so many candidates already in the race for president, the
depth of support displayed ... for Governor Bush is truly
remarkable,'' Solomon told a Capitol Hill news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is weighing a presidential bid and is expected to form an
exploratory committee in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is honored to have this support, but he has still
not decided whether or not he will run for president,'' said Mindy
Tucker, a Bush spokeswoman in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said Bush remained focused on his legislative agenda to
overhaul the state's education system and provide $2.7 billion in
property and sales tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now he has a job to do,'' Tucker said. ``His focus is
the legislative session.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, 52, was elected to a second term in a landslide November
election victory. The son of former President George Bush touts
``compassionate conservatism'' and has made inroads among Hispanic
and black voters, key constituencies of the likely Democratic
nominee, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party's other potential nominees include former
Vice President Dan Quayle, magazine publisher Steve Forbes, former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and former American Red Cross
president Elizabeth Dole, the wife of former GOP presidential
nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Recent visits to New Hampshire, the state where the first
presidential primary is held, gave Dole a narrow lead over Bush in
popularity polls released earlier this week. Dole led with 25
percent compared to 21 percent for Bush in a poll of 454
Republicans. The poll by the American Research Group had a margin
of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates are building organizations and speaking to
potential voters in early primary states.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Guy Molinari of New York said the movement to draft
Bush had ``a tremendous amount of support in every region in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter Goss of Florida said support for Bush was especially
strong in California, Florida and Texas, vote-rich states needed to
win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush backers said the support comes from the governor's message
of ``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It clearly conveys how our approach to government and belief
in American values can really make everyday life better for
Americans who are struggling and suffering,'' said Solomon, who was
co-chairman of Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush's message appeals to conservatives, moderates,
minorities and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The support for Bush eclipses that for Reagan during the same
time in his career,'' Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   The draft Bush letter was signed by 35 current House members,
and 15 former members.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas said the Draft Bush 2000 Committee
was really an ``outreach program for people outside Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Sessions said Bush would receive the support of Texas' entire
GOP delegation if he declares his candidacy, which many at the news
conference here predicted he would.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari said the committee would ``ask the people of Texas ...
to share their governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kay Granger, also of Texas, signed the draft Bush letter.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier of California said Bush's ``message of
inclusion is one the Republican Party needs to put forward. It's a
positive message.''
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls showing voter anger with the Republican-led
Congress for pursuing the impeachment of President Clinton and the
loss of House seats in the 1998 election have Republicans divided
over how to win votes in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Dreier said Bush ``has the opportunity to not only bring the
Republican Party together, but to bring the country together.''

HOW TO GRAPHIC TEXT A Gadget That Taught a Nation to Surf: The TV
Remote Control By LISA NAPOLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BACK when the culture of instant digital gratification was just
a gleam in a futurist's eye, a revolutionary device was invented
that was one of the first steps toward technological power for
consumers: the remote control.
</P>
<P>
   It changed everything. ``The twitch of our fingers on TV remotes
was the first sign of slumbering interactive desires,'' said Paul
Saffo, a director at the Institute for the Future, in Menlo Park,
Calif. ``The remote control wasn't just a new way to change
channels. It changed TV as a medium. Suddenly you didn't have to
watch shows.'' Viewers could channel surf instead. They could watch
several programs at once, have their senses assaulted by sounds and
images and, best of all, they could skip the commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for the remote control was as much to silence
advertisements as to let viewers remain on the couch. The founder
of the Zenith Electronics Corporation, Eugene F. McDonald Jr., said
he thought advertisements would be the death of the nascent
television medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to prove his point by making commercials
unprofitable,'' said Dr. Robert Adler, the Zenith engineer who
created the first practical wireless remote control, which used
ultrasonic signals and went on the market in 1956. More than nine
million televisions with ultrasonic remote controls were sold in 25
years, according to Zenith. But the remote control had a different
effect. It forced advertisers to create spots that were more clever
so they could capture the attention of viewers as they clicked
through the channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the remote, the advertisers had you as their hostage,''
Saffo said. ``They knew you weren't going to get up.''
</P>
<P>
   Adler's creation, called the Space Command, was mechanical. It
literally clicked, or pinged, when a button was pushed. It used an
ultrasonic beam, outside the range of human hearing, to turn a set
on or off or change the channel.
</P>
<P>
   The price for a set and a remote control ranged from $259.95 for
a tabletop model to $550 for a high-end console - hefty price tags
back then. Advertisements for the Space Command proclaimed that
there was ``nothing between you and the set but space!'' Some ads
went on to say: ``Is it magic? It's like nothing you have ever seen
before - anywhere!''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't magic, but it was a big step beyond Zenith's earlier
remote controls. The first such control, marketed in 1950, was the
inelegant but aptly named Lazy Bones. It was tethered to the set by
a long wire, which made it a living-room hazard. The next version,
in 1955, was wireless. It was essentially a flashlight that changed
the channels when it was focused on sensors built into the cabinet
of a set. Thus its name: the Flashmatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a sunny day you had to turn it off because the tuner would
just go crazy,'' Adler recalled in a telephone interview.
Disadvantages aside, more than 30,000 Flashmatics were sold.
</P>
<P>
   The first remote controls seemed to be ahead of their time
because there were few stations to flip through in the 50s. ``It's
surprising how early this technology was created,'' said Ronald C.
Simon, a curator at the Museum of Television and Radio in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   It took awhile for the remote control to catch on. Among the
televisions sold in 1976, 9.5 percent had remote controls; by 1990,
90 percent of them did. But the advent of the remote control was a
big step toward the couch potato culture to come. Viewers could
stay put while they watched, orchestrating their viewing like
maestros with batons, while what they watched came at them at a
faster pace. Over time, there were more channels and shows than
ever before, more than it seemed possible to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge magnetic force in the culture and it goes
toward speed, and the remote control was an essential element in
that direction,'' said Todd Gitlin, a professor of media studies at
New York University. ``'Move it along' - that's what matters. The
speed of movement and the juxtaposition of different images is
absolutely central to how people are living now.''

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T'S FUTURE RIDING ON CABLE TV LINES, CHIEF SAYS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ AT&AMP;T is betting on cable television lines in its
quest to become a 21st century communications powerhouse, Chairman
C. Michael Armstrong said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious from our investments, we're putting our money
where our mouth is on this one,'' Armstrong said in a National
Press Club speech. ``We believe hybrid fiber coaxial has the
potential to carry the most capacity over the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, AT&AMP;T announced a deal to spend $48 billion to
buy the cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. and has reached a
multibillion-dollar agreement with cable conglomerate Time Warner
Inc. Together, these deals will give AT&AMP;T access to the cable lines
into 40 percent of American homes.
</P>
<P>
   And while Armstrong still sees a place for the twisted-copper
wire of the 20th century, he wants to boost the company's cable
coverage to between 60 percent and 70 percent of American homes.
</P>
<P>
   That means more cable deals may be in the works, Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take investment,'' said Armstrong. ``We believe
we can get up to 70 percent of our local telephony strategy covered
by broad-band cable relationships. And 30 percent to 40 percent of
that strategy'' would be wireless or standard telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors, consumer groups and some online service providers
have been pressing the Federal Communications Commission to require
an AT&AMP;T-TCI conglomerate to share its cable lines with competitors.
However, FCC Chairman William E. Kennard has indicated that he will
not require AT&AMP;T to open its cable lines as part of the agency's
approval of the merger, expected in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Armstrong said he doesn't expect AT&AMP;T or cable companies
to operate closed, proprietary cable systems. The companies will
want to partner with content companies such as America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you make money in the networking business is to have
the most traffic over your facilities,'' said Armstrong. ``And that
way you have the most traffic is to attract the most content, ...to
maintain some closed proprietary systems, like some content
providers do, is not in our best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong took several swipes at the regional Bell companies for
what he called ``excessive'' access charges for carrying calls on
their networks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Armstrong said regional Bells charge 4.6 cents per
minute to carry calls through local networks when the actual cost
to the companies is only six-tenths of a cent. ``How long do you
think you as a new competitor could last with that as your cost
base?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   But in a news conference immediately following Armstrong's
appearance, Roy Neel, president of the U.S. Telephone Association,
took issue with Armstrong's charges.
</P>
<P>
   Neel estimated that regional Bell companies charge an average of
2.9 cents per minute to carry local traffic, and those prices are
set by state and federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling about access charges presages a large battle to
come later this year, when the FCC tries to design a new system to
subsidize rural phone service. That plan to revamp the nation's
``universal service'' program is expected to be completed by July.

LITTLE LOGOS, BIG LOAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Md., Nev., N.M., N.Y.)  (js) 
 BY KARRIE JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The logo is nothing spectacular. If it were for a private
business, an ethnic restaurant, say, I wouldn't give it a second
glance. It's just three lowercase letters topped by what looks like
a giant circumflex. But this understated, economical symbol
represents the U.S. government _ Housing and Urban Development
Department, to be precise. The big accent mark is actually a roof.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, branches of the government represent themselves with
something that looks official, which these days means a minimalist
rendition of an eagle. HUD is no exception. The logo that still
appears on its fax cover sheets is a big bird with its wings
abstracted and cropped to resemble a city skyline. But last year,
the department adopted a mark that is jeans-and-T-shirt casual.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa MacSpadden, the department's deputy assistant secretary for
public affairs, explained that the new symbol was a pet project of
Andrew M. Cuomo, the HUD secretary. She volunteered Cuomo, a
Cabinet member with a $25 billion bureaucracy to run, for an
interview about the logo.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the secretary didn't exactly want to discuss
the logo. He had a grander agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said first we'd change the reality of the department, then
the reality would change the perception,''he began. Once he had
begun, there was no stopping him. ``The reality is about a
downsizing, its new system design, its new management structure,
its new employees, its new training. Part of changing the reality
is changing the culture and the stance, the positioning of the
department. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, like his father, Mario M. Cuomo, does not believe in
brevity. But what he was saying, in short, is that HUD's image,
which never quite recuperated from the department's losses during
the real-estate collapse of the '80s, is being made anew.
</P>
<P>
   The logo, which was designed by the BBDO South advertising
agency in Atlanta and first appeared in television spots featuring
the consummate nice guys Bob Vila and Tim Allen, is only one facet
of the department's new anti-bureaucratic style.
</P>
<P>
   The architecture firm of Gensler was hired to invent ``HUD Next
Door,'' a program for transforming departmental offices into
wide-open storefronts where the public can drift in, lounge in
comfortable, brightly patterned chairs, fiddle with computers and
learn what HUD can do for them. All that's missing is a coffee bar.
</P>
<P>
   Gensler also designed a logo: a silhouette of a house with a
pitched roof next to a squarish apartment building, with ``HUD''
inset into the base of the buildings and the phrase ``next door''
extending into space. Gensler's icon appears on HUD's stores, its
new information kiosks and its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   A departmental booklet issued in December, ``100 Questions and
Answers About Buying a New Home,'' so cheerful-looking that it
could be a prospectus for Celebration, the Disney town, displays
the BBDO logo on the front cover and a version of the Gensler logo
on the back.
</P>
<P>
   John Bricker, a Gensler vice president, who helped conjure up
the ``next door'' concept, said he didn't understand why the
department would need or want an additional logo. ``I'm surprised
by the disconnect,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the dual logos, David Stanton, BBDO South's
group creative director, was tactful. ``We would like to have more
synergy,'' he said, and suggested that HUD could ``connect the dots
tighter.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not surprised that this megalithic federal agency, so
chronically entangled in its own bureaucracy that in January it
made the General Accounting Office's list of ``high risk'' agencies
for the fifth year running, commissioned two different graphic
symbols of its new, approachable nature. Of course, it's not as if
either design were going to waste. HUD Next Door stores are opening
in city after city. Washington was the first, followed by
Albuquerque, N.M., and Buffalo, N.Y. Stores are due soon in Reno,
Nev., and Baltimore. And the little roof logo will soon appear in a
string of increasingly kooky television spots by BBDO.
</P>
<P>
   The point of all this creative ferment, Cuomo explained, is to
persuade the home-buying public that HUD is ``on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we're battling is disenfranchisement from
government, negative feelings about government,'' he
said.``Especially the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit that this is a monumental task for one
unpretentious little logo. I can see that HUD might need two.

into 40 percent of American homes.
</P>
<P>
   And while Armstrong still sees a place for the twisted-copper
wire of the 20th century, he wants to boost the company's cable
coverage to between 60 percent and 70 percent of American homes.
</P>
<P>
   That means more cable deals may be in the works, Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take investment,'' said Armstrong. ``We believe
we can get up to 70 percent of our local telephony strategy covered
by broad-band cable relationships. And 30 percent to 40 percent of
that strategy'' would be wireless or standard telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors, consumer groups and some online service providers
have been pressing the Federal Communications Commission to require
an AT&AMP;T-TCI conglomerate to share its cable lines with competitors.
However, FCC Chairman William E. Kennard has indicated that he will
not require AT&AMP;T to open its cable lines as part of the agency's
approval of the merger, expected in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Armstrong said he doesn't expect AT&AMP;T or cable companies
to operate closed, proprietary cable systems. The companies will
want to partner with content companies such as America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way you make money in the networking business is to have
the most traffic over your facilities,'' said Armstrong. ``And that
way you have the most traffic is to attract the most content, ...to
maintain some closed proprietary systems, like some content
providers do, is not in our best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong took several swipes at the regional Bell companies for
what he called ``excessive'' access charges for carrying calls on
their networks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Armstrong said regional Bells charge 4.6 cents per
minute to carry calls through local networks when the actual cost
to the companies is only six-tenths of a cent. ``How long do you
think you as a new competitor could last with that as your cost
base?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   But in a news conference immediately following Armstrong's
appearance, Roy Neel, president of the U.S. Telephone Association,
took issue with Armstrong's charges.
</P>
<P>
   Neel estimated that regional Bell companies charge an average of
2.9 cents per minute to carry local traffic, and those prices are
set by state and federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The squabbling about access charges presages a large battle to
come later this year, when the FCC tries to design a new system to
subsidize rural phone service. That plan to revamp the nation's
``universal service'' program is expected to be completed by July.

RANDOM HOUSE TO PUBLISH ELLISON'S UNFINISHED NOVEL, `JUNETEENTH'

(DW) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly a half century after the publication of Ralph Ellison's
landmark novel, ``Invisible Man,'' Random House is preparing to
publish his second novel, a work he struggled with for more than 40
years and left unfinished when he died in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison began writing the book in 1954, seemed on the verge of
completing it in 1967, then kept revising and rethinking it until
his death at the age of 80. The novel, ``Juneteenth,'' is set for
publication on June 19 or Juneteenth, the anniversary of the day in
1865 when Texas slaves finally learned of the Emancipation
Proclamation, which had taken effect two and a half years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited book figures to be one of the major publishing
events in years. Ellison's life largely was defined by his one
classic novel, but his words are now pouring out in a spate of
publishing productivity he never matched while he was alive.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the New Republic is printing 16 pages of previously
unpublished letters from a collection of several thousand at the
Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The letters and certainly the novel are expected to provide new
insight into one of the most celebrated literary figures of the
century and one of the most distinctive and idiosyncratic voices on
race. Along with collections of essays and early short stories
already posthumously published, fragments of an early novel, a
novella and memoir have also been found, an enormous literary
output coming to light after Ellison's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really iceberg time,'' said John F. Callahan, Ellison's
literary executor and a professor of humanities at Lewis and Clark
College in Portland, Ore. ``He had all this stuff, and he might not
have polished it and done the final revisions to suit a
perfectionist like him, but there is a huge amount of work and much
of it is very worthwhile stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Of most interest, of course, will be ``Juneteenth,'' a 350-page
meditation on race and identity. The novel tells the story of a
black jazzman-turned-minister named Hickman, who raises a little
boy of ambiguous background, bringing him up as a black child
although he looks white. The boy eventually runs away and grows up
to be a race-baiting senator from a New England state. After being
shot on the Senate floor, the politician summons Hickman to his
side and their conversations spin out their shared past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anybody who has been affected, moved and influenced by
`Invisible Man' is going to want to read this book,'' Callahan
said. ``It's a very important book. The title refers to the day of
liberation, and this book is very much about liberation and the
complexities of liberation. Given all the denials and attempts to
gloss over the meaning of race, it's an attempt to remind people of
some of the profundities of race and of being an American, which
was Ellison's great theme. What it means to be a true American was
almost a sacred thing for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, who was born in Oklahoma City in 1914, began playing
the trumpet at age 8 and gravitated toward both music and writing.
Visiting a friend in Vermont after World War II, he typed out, ``I
am an invisible man,'' and thus began his great novel, which was
written over seven years and published in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   The book tells the story of an unnamed black man who grows up in
the segregated South and moves to New York and battles to create an
identity apart from the stereotypes of race. The book, with its
famous last line, ``Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I
speak for you?'' transcends the black experience as a meditation on
identity, alienation and self-definition influenced as much by
Dostoyevsky as by black authors such as Richard Wright.
</P>
<P>
   The insistence on an individual identity apart from a group
identity often made him a controversial figure and put him at odds
with the reigning black intellectuals of his time, particularly the
black militants _ he uses the words often in his letters _ of the
1960s and 70s.
</P>
<P>
   He started thinking about his second novel (it is not a sequel
to ``Invisible Man'') even before his first one was published and
started working on it in 1954. He was supposed to be close to
finishing it in 1967, but a fire at his summer home in the
Berkshires destroyed a summer's worth of revisions and he spend the
rest of his life refashioning the work.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said the novel being published is the major part of
what will eventually be a larger scholarly edition with other
sections of the sprawling manuscript included.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't finish the novel because it became a saga, and
within the saga were a number of possible novels,'' he said. ``But
in the midst of it all was this novel that had come to fruition.
It's entirely his. Every word. What was needed was extracting it
and to some extent getting guidance from his notes about things
like sequencing.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``What he left was like an unfinished house of
fiction, and to keep the metaphor, this is like the essence of the
house, something he had all but completed. There are other wings of
the house that are a good deal less finished and hang together less
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said the novel is about the evasion and discovery of
identity, a theme that, along with Ellison's efforts to avoid the
oversimplifications of race, echo through the letters being
published in The New Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest ones, from 1933 to 1936, were to his mother when
Ellison was at Tuskegee Institute, now Tuskegee University. Others
are exchanges with leading literary figures like Saul Bellow,
Robert Penn Warren, Albert Murray, Richard Wright and Alfred Kazin.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, who culled and annotated the letters for the magazine,
plans at some point to put together a collection of Ellison's
letters, which are mostly carbons of letters he sent to friends and
family members over six decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see very clearly in the letters is the way he saw
American culture and American identity as being of a whole,''
Callahan said. ``Over and over we see Ellison rejecting what people
call racial determinism. One of the things that really irked
Ellison was the idea that because of slavery and segregation, black
folks had become dehumanized. Instead, he saw black culture as
something that is beautiful and profound but with an influence on
the larger culture that is indisputable.''
</P>
<P>
   His views on culture and race were perhaps most succinctly
stated in a 1971 letter to a student at Southern Illinois
University who had asked him to contribute to a study entitled:
``Toward a Model With Rationale for Black Studies Curriculums.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe, however, that I can be of any assistance to
you, since I have never taught black studies as such. It is my
opinion that disciplines such as history and literature when taught
must include Negro American reality but that it cannot be taught
separately since it did not evolve separately.''
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said the letters both reinforce and expand the public
image of Ellison. The themes in the letters are entirely consistent
with the work, he said, but the letters also show a more playful,
humorous side than the more austere, intellectual image he had.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1978 letter he writes of walking down a street in
Northhampton, Mass., carrying a new rake and coming upon a black
student, his hair bushed out in an Afro, wearing new overalls and
doing ``a pimp limp or hustler's walk.'' Ellison stopped him and
said, ``Just look at us, brother. My father and your grandfather
probably worked like hell to get away from the farm so we could be
born to an easier life, but just look at how it all turned out.
You're going to a fancy college wearing overalls, and I'm walking
around this white man's city carrying a cast-iron rake.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1958 letter to Time, he seemed to enjoy taking issue with
the magazine's assertion that he was self-exiled in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I am too vindictively American, too full of hate
for the hateful aspects of this country, and too possessed by the
things I love here to be too long away,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   And in another letter he throws off what Callahan said could be
an epigraph for his life and work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's to integration,'' he wrote. ``The only integration that
counts: that of the personality.''

THE YEAR OF BIG BANDWIDTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When my local cable television operator, Time Warner, told me
that after several months of waiting, I was next on the list to get
a cable modem, I was practically drooling with anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   A cable modem is related to a regular computer modem the way the
movie ``Speed'' is related to ``Driving Miss Daisy.'' Using the
local cable television network instead of the local phone network
to connect to the Internet's main arteries, a cable modem hauls
tons of data at high speeds _ theoretically anywhere from 10
megabits per second (millions of bits, or Mbps) to more than 25
Mbps, but in practical terms 500 kilobits per second (thousands of
bits, or Kbps) to 2.5 Mbps.
</P>
<P>
   A cable modem has high bandwidth, an industry buzz word, meaning
it carries a lot of information. If is also often called a fat
pipe, on the idea that data is like water and comes into your
computer in a rush or a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Only a relatively small number of home computer users are now
eligible to sign up for the high-bandwidth Internet services now
being offered by cable television companies (cable modems) and
phone companies (digital subscriber lines, or DSL).
</P>
<P>
   But in the coming year, as these industries battle to sell
high-speed data services to consumers, potentially millions of
people and small businesses will have the opportunity to wallow in
the kind of bandwidth that once was affordable only by corporations
and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Just a short while ago, I was a low bandwidth kind of guy. I had
one of the fastest telephone-based modems you can buy in my home
office, with a theoretical top speed of 56 Kbps. Most people who
connect to the Internet from home do so at speeds ranging from 14.4
Kbps to 33.6 Kbps.
</P>
<P>
   So a cable modem held the promise of increasing my bandwidth at
least tenfold, and, down hill with a tail wind and no other
traffic, perhaps as much as fiftyfold. But there were some speed
bumps, which will be discussed below. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the dial-up modems used by most consumers today _ so called
because user has to dial up a phone connection between the home
computer and the Internet Service Provider (ISP) each time he or
she wants to go on line _ using the World Wide Web is like reading
a magazine in slow motion, turning the page once every 20 seconds
or so. No wonder some people call it the World Wide Wait.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate Internet users and students in dormitories often
connect to the Internet over so-called broadband networks, which
are high-capacity, shared data pipes. For years, phone companies
have sold big-bandwidth Internet pipelines for hefty fees, usually
$1,000 a month or more.
</P>
<P>
   A T-1 telephone line, for example, has a bandwidth of 1.5
megabits per second. Turning a web page or downloading a picture
from a Usenet news group on a T-1 link often takes only a second or
two. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a cable modem or one of the new DSL modems just starting to
be offered by the phone companies, consumers can get some of the
benefits of a T-1 line for $40 to $60 a month. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, $40 to $60 a month is still a lot of money, especially if
you are also paying the cable company for television service. My
monthly cable bill went to $79 a month from $34 overnight. Plus,
there was a one-time installation fee of $89. Plus, PC users have
to buy (for $50 or more) an Ethernet card, also known as a Network
Interface Card, or NIC. (These come standard on most Macintoshes.)
</P>
<P>
   And there was the aggravation of dealing with the cable company,
which, despite the cable industry's efforts to improve its image
for customer support, still managed to amaze me with its
incompetence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It took several visits, spread over two weeks, by a total of
five cable guys before my Macintosh G3 was finally wired into the
cable network and working properly. Strange to say, it was worth
it. I love my cable modem.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is always ``on'' at my house, at least as long as
my computer has power. This persistent connection has psychological
as well as practical effects. I doubt that people would watch as
much TV if they had to boot up the TV, wait a couple of minutes for
the TV to ``handshake'' with the network, and then wait 20 seconds
each time they wanted to change a channel.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now my phone company tells me I'm also near the top of the list
to get a DSL modem. Like a cable modem, a DSL modem promises
consumers a large increase in Internet bandwidth for monthly prices
ranging from $40 to $60. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both cable and DSL modems have advantages and disadvantages. For
many people the relative differences are moot because, for now at
least, most consumers do not have a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies and phone companies are racing to upgrade
equipment in their more affluent neighborhoods (the ones with the
highest percentage of computer users) to make high-speed services
possible. It will take years before most homes have access to these
services. Meanwhile Net users hungry for bandwidth will take what
they can get. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cable already goes past most homes in the United States, but not
all can carry high-speed data. While almost all homes are wired for
telephone service, it takes special equipment at the local
switching station to support DSL service, and only a few hundred of
the thousands nationwide have it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DSL is, to a greater extent than cable, fragmented by different
and incompatible standards. Also, to a greater extent than cable,
DSL is limited by distance. People who live more than about 3 miles
from a local switching station cannot get DSL service.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While cable modems offer higher theoretical top speeds than DSL
modems, DSL modems offer higher guaranteed speeds. On my cable
system, my bandwidth depends on how many people are using the same
local loop at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   If all of my neighbors sign up for cable Internet service and
log on at the same time, my bandwidth could slow to a crawl _
scarcely better than the dial-up modem I replaced. Because I was
one of the first kids on my block to have a cable modem, however,
I'm cruising at megabit speeds most of the time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, with any type of modem one rarely achieves the
maximum speed; any given connection on the Internet is limited by
the slowest link.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DSL comes in a bewildering variety of speed and price offerings.
In my area of the country, the $49 monthly consumer plan guarantees
me Internet access at asymmetric speeds of 384 Kbps when I am
downloading something from the Internet, and a minimum of 128 Kbps
when I am sending information upstream. (Because the upstream and
downstream speeds are asymmetric, this kind of DSL service is
called ADSL.) While 384K is the guaranteed downstream minimum, the
phone company says I can expect gusts up to 1.5 Mbps. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cable, then, offers higher highs and lower lows for about the
same price as ADSL. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My local ADSL service gives me a choice of Internet Service
Providers. I can buy just the basic pipe for $39 a month, and then
pay a separate fee to my current ISP in order to keep my current
e-mail address and web page, if my ISP supports my kind of ADSL.
Or, for an extra $10 a month, I can use the phone company as my
ISP. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With cable, I have no choice. Time Warner provides me with its
Roadrunner service whether I want it or not. It is as if I signed
up for local telephone service and was told that I could choose any
long distance carrier as long as it was AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   As more people start to get fat pipes, the fights will become
fierce over what comes over those pipes and how. We can expect
fierce regulatory battles in the coming year as different companies
try to get the cable companies to open their pipes to different
voice, data, video and audio services.

I'm cruising at megabit speeds most of the time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, with any type of modem one rarely achieves the
maximum speed; any given connection on the Internet is limited by
the slowest link.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DSL comes in a bewildering variety of speed and price offerings.
In my area of the country, the $49 monthly consumer plan guarantees
me Internet access at asymmetric speeds of 384 Kbps when I am
downloading something from the Internet, and a minimum of 128 Kbps
when I am sending information upstream. (Because the upstream and
downstream speeds are asymmetric, this kind of DSL service is
called ADSL.) While 384K is the guaranteed downstream minimum, the
phone company says I can expect gusts up to 1.5 Mbps. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cable, then, offers higher highs and lower lows for about the
same price as ADSL. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My local ADSL service gives me a choice of Internet Service
Providers. I can buy just the basic pipe for $39 a month, and then
pay a separate fee to my current ISP in order to keep my current
e-mail address and web page, if my ISP supports my kind of ADSL.
Or, for an extra $10 a month, I can use the phone company as my
ISP. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With cable, I have no choice. Time Warner provides me with its
Roadrunner service whether I want it or not. It is as if I signed
up for local telephone service and was told that I could choose any
long distance carrier as long as it was AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   As more people start to get fat pipes, the fights will become
fierce over what comes over those pipes and how. We can expect
fierce regulatory battles in the coming year as different companies
try to get the cable companies to open their pipes to different
voice, data, video and audio services.

AMID THE FRILLS OF ASTEROIDS, A CLASSIC TREAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Playing the new version of Asteroids, you realize that the
biggest difference between this game and the original arcade
classic isn't the 3-D graphics, the hopped-up special effects or
the orchestral score. It's the context.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years have passed since Asteroids was first released. In
1979, oil prices were shooting up, and the fallout from Three Mile
Island was floating down. Margaret Thatcher had just been elected.
Iranians were holding hostages in Tehran. Girls were wearing
designer jeans, and Blondie's ``Heart of Glass'' was on the radio.
``Saturday Night Live'' was still funny. The first NASA shuttle had
yet to be launched, space was still mysterious and inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   In that year of recession and turmoil and disco, a
refrigerator-size machine made its appearance: Asteroids. On
screen, pencil-thin white lines floated on a field of black. A
small wedge darted and fired at flying space boulders, smashing
them into smaller rocks, then into oblivion. Their outlines fell
apart with balletic precision as a vaguely hypnotic bass line
thumped in the background. A tiny glowing saucer flew by, shooting
deadly dots of light. Asteroids had the elegance of good modern
architecture. It was the video game the Bauhaus would have
produced.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to 1999: Asteroids is a CD-ROM running on a
200-megahertz PC. The game still plays out in two dimensions, but
the targets have volume and texture. There are more enemies, more
weapons, explosive visual effects and high-resolution cinematic cut
scenes, all in color.
</P>
<P>
   There are 10 space worlds, some with deadly black holes, some
with hostile suns that shoot flames as they go supernova. The
thumping bass line of the original game has been incorporated as a
leitmotif in the surging electronic soundtrack that swells as your
ship is sucked from wormhole to wormhole.
</P>
<P>
   In the final showdown, an ``Independence Day'' Meets ``Deep
Impact'' scenario, the extraterrestrials launch an asteroid attack
on Planet Earth. Bauhaus it's not. Compared with the stark
minimalist original, Asteroids 1999 is baroque.
</P>
<P>
   The new game makes you realize how the esthetics of technology
have changed in the last 20 years and how our visual sensibilities
have changed with them. In the 70s, technology was square and
vaguely forbidding. It had sharp edges. It had corners. Ten years
later, industrial design got curvy and ergonomic. On the outside,
everything was egg-shaped, but on screen, there weren't many
whistles and bells. We were working with word processors and
spreadsheets and Unix command lines. Form followed function.
</P>
<P>
   As the chips became faster and the operating systems grew
fatter, icons and windows and menu bars staked their claims on the
desktop. CD-ROMs and Web browsers splashed thousands of colors
across the screen; 3-D accelerators gave us dynamic lighting
effects and video game characters with realistic hair.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, we had Java and Shockwave. Web pages started to
blink. Things began to spin. Animated characters now dance little
jigs in their banner-ad playpens. The reigning design philosophy
is, in a word, (italics)more.(end italics) More images. More
gimmicks. Everything must be expanded, improved, revised!
</P>
<P>
   Technology has become baroque. Ornamental overkill is something
we have come to expect. Indeed, it's what the market demands. But
at some point, rococo technology, like rococo painting, becomes
overblown and ridiculous, to the point of self-parody.
</P>
<P>
   That becomes achingly apparent in Asteroids when you hit an
overrendered 3-D spinning boulder, and a number flashes, ``1979,''
pitching you into the original arcade game. All the flourishes and
gilding are stripped away, and what's left is the essence of this
game, white lines on black.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Proustian frisson, if you are old enough to remember
playing Asteroids the first time around. But mostly, it's just a
relief to have the overblown production wiped away so you can
concentrate on the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   Because what's really fun about Asteroids, or any video game, is
the structure of the thing: the rhythms and the patterns and the
mechanics of interaction.
</P>
<P>
   And to the extent that the surface esthetics distract from that
core experience, the game is less absorbing. It does not immerse
the player because immersion is about forgetting. It's about losing
your self-awareness, blurring the distinction between what's
happening in front of you and what's happening in your head. The
more cluttered the screen becomes, the less likely we are to lose
ourselves in it.
</P>
<P>
   The 1979 version of Asteroids is immersive because it is
transparent _ there is not a single pixel of descriptive
information on the screen. Everything you see is essential to the
mechanics of game play. That's why, with all the structural
elements held constant, the 1979 version is addictive and the 1999
version is not.
</P>
<P>
   All the video sequences and visual overproduction pull you out
of the experience. By calling attention to themselves, they turn
you into a viewer, rather than an integral part of this universe.
So it's easy to say, at the end of a game, ``I'm through watching
now.'' At the end of Asteroids '79, all you can say is, ``One more
game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last 20 years, our media have become increasingly opaque,
promising richer content while inducing visual indigestion. With
500 channels and animated mascots turning somersaults on the World
Wide Web, it's no wonder we have become jaded and restless,
compulsively clicking in search of something that commands our
attention.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, it's easy to see why people get nostalgic for
20-year-old technology. Its limits, born of necessity, look like
virtues in retrospect. If elegance is refusal, old media seem even
more elegant in hindsight because now there's more to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   Classic arcade games had an incredible amount of ingenuity and
clarity per line of code. It will be a long time before the
creators of today's interactive media can say the same.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there's Asteroids (polyester shirts optional).
</P>
<P>
   Published by Activision; for Playstation and Windows 95 and
later; $39.95; all ages.

VIRTUAL FRIDGE DOOR, MINUS MAGNETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Saturday, I forgot that my 7-year-old daughter was supposed
to go to a birthday party. I am at a loss to explain how I forgot
because the invitation was prominently displayed at eye level on
the refrigerator door. It was between my second-grader's most
recent spelling test (``100 plus plus _ excellent!'') and a photo
of the baby getting a kiss from a jelly-faced friend, and it was
barely covered by the corner of the school cafeteria's monthly
menu, on which someone had scrawled ``Bring lunch from home!'' next
to ``Feb. 22 _ Pork sausage parmesan.''
</P>
<P>
   The next morning I phoned the parents of the birthday girl and
apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't explain it because I also had the time and date
written in my schedule book,'' I said. ``Of course, I'm not sure
where I left the book.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand completely,'' the mother said. ``Last fall, I
totally forgot about a meeting at work. Missed it. For no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a good reason, at least in my case. With my family of
five, I would need the choreography skills of Balanchine to execute
gracefully all the steps needed to complete my competing
obligations: the after-school Web Page Club, the dentist, the
working lunches and the (increasingly frequent) pit stops at a
local Starbuck's.
</P>
<P>
   But after I found a coffee-stained scrap of paper covered with
the inscrutable message ``Friday, 11 a.m., IMPORTANT,'' I realized
that things were out of hand. It was time to clean up the whole
mess _ to solve the mystery of the missing schedule book, to
liberate the refrigerator and to enter all the flotsam of our lives
onto a master calendar that I could check daily. And never
misplace.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the best place for such a calendar would be the
Internet, a place I visit religiously after the rest of the
household disperses to various schools, offices and morning naps.
</P>
<P>
   Since I was already online to check e-mail and my favorite Web
sites, it would make sense to add the ritual of checking a daily
calendar based on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   To test my theory, I went to a site called
www.familyshoebox.com. This site, which is operated by Koz Inc.,
offers a number of free services designed to streamline family
life. Its easy-to-use templates let you do things like creating an
umbrella site, linking an extended family's various Web pages,
publishing an online newsletter and organizing threaded
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to start slowly, by registering for a free family
calendar. After choosing a member name and password, I was almost
instantly assigned a Web headquarters for my family.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I clicked on Calendar, and a divided page appeared. The
left side displayed a one-month calendar for February 1999. If I
clicked on any specific date, that day's schedule would appear on
the right side of the screen. When I clicked on Update, editing
tools appeared.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to enter ``Ella's piano lesson, 4:30,'' using a
pull-down menu to decide whether it would be a one-time event or
should be entered as a daily, weekly, monthly or even annual event
on my family calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing Ella, I chose ``one-time only.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, the site prompted me, with easy-to-complete forms, to
enter a description of the event, the location and the time it was
to start and end. The site enabled me to enter far more details
about an event than would fit in my date book.
</P>
<P>
   After I clicked on Save, the site entered the information under
the correct date on my calendar.
</P>
<P>
   I was pleased _ until I realized that entering a single event
had used up roughly 30 seconds of my time. With 54 more events to
enter for the remainder of February, this project might consume
enough time to conflict with the day's scheduled 3:30 p.m. pickup
at school.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly I flashed back, recovering an unpleasant memory from
the early 1990s of an attempt to enter my household financial
information into the Quicken software program. I aborted the effort
before I was even halfway through my checkbook register.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid admitting defeat again, I took a cleansing breath and
decided there must be some way to speed up the process.
</P>
<P>
   I phoned Koz for advice. Instead of entering and saving events
one at a time, could I, for instance, click on a date and then type
in all the day's events in a single entry?
</P>
<P>
   ``That suggestion has been brought up before,'' said Doug
Patton, a Koz product manager. ``It's in the queue _ not a hard
thing to change. It's an enhancement that we're working on.''
</P>
<P>
   I returned to my calendar, entering such vital events as ``pick
up vacuum from repair shop'' and ``Hebrew school _ car pool,'' but
I found the process too tedious. I then went over to www.yahoo.com
to check out that site's free calendar service.
</P>
<P>
   While the design was remarkably similar and the event-entry
process only sligh &QC; ly faster, I preferred two other Yahoo features
greatly.
</P>
<P>
   One was the To Do list that appeared under the monthly calendar,
making it easy to lump mundane chores like the vacuum cleaner
expedition together in one place instead of entering each
separately.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Yahoo calendar can communicate with a Palm Pilot or a
Microsoft Outlook 97 or 98 schedule, enabling you to trade
information back and forth. None of that would help me, however,
because I don't own a Palm Pilot (I would just lose it) and I don't
use Microsoft Outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Will either calendar organize my life? Not totally. But there
was a nice side benefit to the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   When I was looking for the vacuum cleaner receipt, I found my
date book _ on top of the refrigerator.

 &HT;    IOC vows swift action in Salt Lake City probe
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The embattled International Olympic Committee on Wednesday said
it would act swiftly in response to the findings of a Salt Lake
City investigation into the campaign for the 2002 Winter Games that
implicated 10 additional members in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   With the new names surfacing in the report, the number of IOC
members linked to the ethical violations reached 24, one-fifth of
the committee's membership at the time of the 1993 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Pal Schmitt, an IOC vice president and member of the six-person
internal commission investigating the Salt Lake allegations,
refused to comment on the report. ``I'm sure we have a copy now and
can begin to examine it,'' Schmitt said from his office in Bern,
where he is Hungary's ambassador to Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Schmitt said he expected the commission to meet soon to review
the report before the full IOC meets in a special session to
address the scandal in March.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC said in a statement it would act promptly after its
commission reviewed the report. The IOC remains fully committed to
investigating and taking action based on available evidence, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, led by Canadian IOC member Dick Pound, is
recommending the expulsions of five members because of their
actions during Salt Lake's bid. Investigators have said that IOC
members accepted more than $1 million in cash, gifts, first-class
travel and college scholarships from the Salt Lake bidding
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Four members have resigned, and one was issued a warning. One
member died before the scandal erupted.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC commission will examine the 300-page report for any
fresh allegations against three members whose cases remain under
investigation. They are Kim Un-Young of South Korea, Louis
Guirandou-N'Diaye of the Ivory Coast and Vitaly Smirnov of Russia.
Each has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Two IOC members cited in the report denied on Wednesday that
they did anything wrong. An attorney for Australian IOC member Phil
Coles denied to reporters in Sydney that his client accepted four
expenses-paid trips to the United States during Salt Lake's bidding
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Coles intends to submit a report to the IOC to clear his name as
soon as possible, his lawyer said. The ethics report alleged that
Coles had taken his family on paid vacations to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, the highest-ranking member named in the scandal, has
demanded that the IOC inquiry commission clear him, and he is
expected to renew his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, Kim said he thinks that the Salt Lake report cleared
him of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake report indicated that neither Kim nor his son were
aware that the bidding committee was providing $45,000 to Keystone
Communications, a Utah company, to fund a job for Kim's son, Kim
Jung-hoon, also known as John Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Any secret deal between the bid committee and Keystone was a
contrivance solely between those two entities, and was unknown to
the elder Kim or his son, said Howard Graff, Kim's U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who makes no secret of his desire to succeed Juan Antonio
Samaranch as president of the IOC, said he will not resign and
intends to fight any attempt to expel him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such persistent attempts to smear both my reputation and the
leadership of president Samaranch are political and designed to
undermine the stability of his leadership as well as to affect the
succession of his presidency,'' Kim told the Associated Press.
``When the time comes, I will fight back. I have a lot of
ammunition.''

convict Clinton on the perjury and obstruction of justice charges _
votes that by all signs will fall far short of the two-thirds

Coverdell asked if Senators could submit their statements without

   TEX-LEGIS-GAYADOPTION _ AUSTIN _ Gays and lesbians would no
longer be allowed to adopt children under bills filed by Rep.
Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, and Rep. Robert Talton R-Pasadena. Chisum
and Talton say that children are better off in traditional family
situations. Opponents note that gays and lesbians often adopt
children with ``special needs'' who might not be adopted otherwise,
and that the bills would prevent straight parents who die or can no
longer care for their children from leaving them with gay siblings
or friends. We visit with some of the people who would be affected
and scrutinize the data marshaled by both sides. (Greenberger,

<P>
   NEW YORK _ One afternoon in January, Leslie Keno, the director
of the American furniture department at Sotheby's, waited in the
main auction room for the sale of lot 704, a rare and important
secretary bookcase that he hoped would highlight the bidding that
day.
</P>
<P>
   As an employee of Sotheby's for 18 years and as one of the
experts on the popular PBS program ``Antiques Roadshow,'' Keno, 41,
has examined as many as 100,000 objects in his life. But none had
ever affected him the way this one did. Its great rarity, its
superb craftsmanship and its strange beauty all seduced and
mesmerized him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to take my eyes off of it,'' Keno recalled. ``I
had never seen anything this magnificent in my career. I would come
into the room where we had it on display and find myself drawn to
the piece. It had that effect on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Keno's colleague William W. Stahl Jr. was conducting the sale
that day. Stahl had already hammered down a Queen Anne bonnet-top
chest of drawers that alone brought $266,500, together with
assorted tables, chairs and chests. Though Keno tried to
concentrate on them, he found it difficult to keep his mind off lot
704. He had estimated the secretary bookcase at between $500,000
and $800,000. He hoped it would bring much, much more.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, Jan. 17, at Sotheby's most important American
furniture sale of the year, the ``Appleton secretary bookcase,'' as
it was called, sold for $8,250,500, the second highest price ever
paid for a piece of American furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary had led an astonishing life, from its creation in
Newport, R.I., in the 1740s through a lengthy residence abroad.
Many experts believe that the discovery of so unique and fine an
object, from such an early period, will have lasting implications
for the study of American furniture.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Leslie Keno's twin brother, Leigh Keno, a New
York dealer and no less an authority, ``It shatters the notions of
what cabinetmakers did and didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Appleton secretary stood nearly 9 feet tall, with four
drawers leading from its feet to the slanting lid of its desk, or
secretary. Above the desk were two doors, each with a carved shell
at its top, that opened onto the bookcase. And the piece was
finished with a tall arched ``dome,'' complete with three finials.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Keno had first heard of the secretary some years earlier,
when a dealer of French antiques walked into Sotheby's in Paris to
say that he had seen such an object in a small apartment on the
Right Bank. Keno made a point to keep in touch with the French
dealer. Over the next few years, he learned a great deal more about
this extraordinary American creation.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary had been made for a distinguished New England
clergyman named Nathaniel Appleton and had descended in his family
ever since, through a U.S. diplomat who settled in France. From
photographs Keno had seen, he also concluded that it had been made
in Newport by the celebrated Goddard-Townsend family of
cabinetmakers, considered by some to be the best ever to work in
America. One of these craftsmen, a Quaker named John Townsend,
built the Nicholas Brown secretary, which sold in 1990 for $12.3
million, still a record for American furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Keno could tell from photographs of the Appleton secretary that
its doors, its desk lid and its drawer fronts had been constructed
of an extremely rare wood known as ``mottled'' or ``plum-pudding''
mahogany, for the dark spots that fill its surface and give it
depth and character. But he wondered about the chances of also
finding the mottling on those hidden surfaces usually given over to
less expensive ``secondary'' woods.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the promise of exotic wood, Keno had noted
another feature that would make the secretary not just a
masterpiece but an icon of American furniture. With most fine
American pieces, the drawer handles, locks and other hardware are
so commonly made of brass that people in the trade refer to them as
``brasses.''
</P>
<P>
   What struck Keno about the Appleton secretary was that all its
handles and knobs _ even the little parrots that were used, like
handles, to pull out the supports for the desk lid _ were made of
silver. What was more, these silver ``brasses'' were said to be
marked by a well-known Rhode Island silversmith named Samuel Casey.
</P>
<P>
   Keno could hardly credit this account, since no American
furniture with such silver mounts had ever been discovered. For
most of this century, in fact, dealers and collectors of American
antiques have talked of finding a piece with silver hardware as one
might speak of searching for the Holy Grail.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day last spring, following a death in the family that
owned the secretary, two elderly French gentlemen _ descendants of
Nathaniel Appleton _ invited Keno to view in person the object that
had so enthralled him. He flew to Paris at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I just stood there without even pulling the drawers
out,'' Keno said. ``I just looked at it for a long time. I had
never seen plum-pudding mahogany on the side panels of a piece like
this before. Over the next two hours, I pulled the drawers out,
opened the upper doors. Normally with Newport furniture you'll see
chestnut or some other local tree used in the secondary woods. When
I saw that the drawer  &UR; sides &LR;  were mahogany, too, I thought, `This
is incredible.' It was absolutely incredible. I just stood there in
awe.''
</P>
<P>
   As he studied the secretary _ still filled with all those books
and papers it was meant to hold _ Keno helped the two gentlemen see
the great unity of its design . He pointed out how the profiles of
the silver parrots' beaks were echoed in the curving outlines of
the bookcase shelves and how the silversmith _ Samuel Casey, it
turned out _ had stamped the handles. He showed them how the shape
of the dome was reflected in the shells on the front and in the
arched drawers of the writing desk. From the top of its dome
through the shells on its doors and the silver handles on its
drawers, it was, to him, a nearly perfect object.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One element alone had always given Keno concern, which seeing
the secretary in person did nothing to relieve. There could be no
doubt that however great the piece was, it lacked the proper height
for its otherwise magnificent proportions. Keno did not think this
awkwardness a fault of its design. He had long since recognized
that objects that begin their lives at 9 feet tall do not always
survive two centuries with every inch in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the gentlemen I thought the feet were a problem,'' he
remembered. ``I told them, `I think the feet have probably been cut
down 5 or 6 inches.'''
</P>
<P>
   Keno did not dwell on this unhappy news, of course. When two
handshakes sealed the deal for him to sell the secretary, he left
with a smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   It is Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
   As he stands on the floor of the auction room, waiting for Stahl
to say the words that will send his treasure on its way, Keno knows
that much has happened to Nathaniel Appleton's secretary that might
help its chances here.
</P>
<P>
   On the day it arrived at Sotheby's and he could finally view its
base, Keno discovered to his surprise that it had not been cut down
after all. In every corner he found a square hole that had once
held a foot beneath it. As Keno and his colleague John Nye tried to
imagine what could have been there, they thought of the bracket
bases on early Georgian dome-topped secretary bookcases, which
sometimes stood on four ball feet.
</P>
<P>
   That was it. Now that he could imagine how this piece, too, had
stood on four such balls, he could get Sotheby's restoration
department to replace the missing feet. And when, in time, the
secretary was heaved up once again, the effect was striking.
Suddenly it was clear that these ball feet were just what had been
missing all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``That put the piece in a totally different perspective,'' Keno
will recall. ``It gave it the right height. It made it rarer,
because we'd never seen such feet on Rhode Island furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of people who might desire a masterpiece of American
furniture, and have the wherewithal to buy it _ the people to whom
such differences might matter _ is usually about 10.
</P>
<P>
   They include Theodore Alfond, who once owned Dexter Shoe Co. and
who has come to Sotheby's today. Anthony Wang, whose father is
Charles Wang, a computer software magnate worth an estimated $975
million, has showed up, too. Others who might want such a piece
include Robert Bass, the Dallas billionaire who paid $12.3 million
for the Nicholas Brown secretary; Ned Johnson, the chairman of
Fidelity Investments, and Tim Robertson, a son of evangelist Pat
Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   As Keno looks out on the crowd, Stahl turns his attention to the
object whose sale everyone has waited for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lot 704,'' he calls out. ``The Appleton desk bookcase.''
</P>
<P>
   The lights dim. On a screen at the front of the room, Keno shows
a slide of a signature he found that week on the secretary's top
drawer. The signature is that of its maker, Christopher Townsend,
patriarch of the great Newport cabinetmaking family.
</P>
<P>
   The lights come back up. Stahl begins the bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hundred and fifty thousand,'' he calls out. Keno will
remember that his heart was pounding.
</P>
<P>
   With Stahl on the podium, the bidding proceeds in an orderly
fashion, back and forth and up and up, in increments of $50,000. As
the bidding rises to $1 million and the increments to $100,000, the
number of players grows smaller and smaller.
</P>
<P>
   At $2.1 million, Stahl takes a bid from William Samaha, one of
the country's leading dealers, in Ohio, whom he has known for
nearly 25 years. Keno is glad to see that Samaha has come prepared
to bid and wonders what his limit is. ``In the past, he's gone very
strong on some major items,'' he thinks.
</P>
<P>
   From the photographs Sotheby's sent to him, Samaha thought the
secretary looked, in his words, ``awkward, in a way.'' But on
seeing it in person, he found to his surprise that he could not so
easily dismiss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those damned signed brasses that said, `S. Casey,' rang a
bell,'' Samaha will say. ``You have to look closely. You have to
think, `This could really be major.' When you see it's not just
mahogany, but fine mahogany in the secondary wood, that telegraphs
a message, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two million, one hundred thousand,'' Stahl says.
</P>
<P>
   He looks below the podium to the bank of white telephones, where
Roberta Loucks, a vice president of Sotheby's, has given him the
previous bid.
</P>
<P>
   Just in front of her, Leigh Keno is sitting next to Wang. It's
widely known that Keno has advised the collector on occasion. Some
people suspect _ wrongly, in fact _ that the person on the
telephone is bidding for them. Leigh Keno is certainly not bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two million, one hundred thousand,'' Stahl says. ``Do I
hear $2,200,000?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Loucks nods her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two million two on the telephone,'' Stahl says and looks back
to Samaha. ``Do I hear $2,300,000?''
</P>
<P>
   Samaha nods. Back and forth the bidding goes between the
telephone and Samaha, in increments of $100,000 _ $3 million, $4
million, $5 million. At this level, the Appleton secretary has
already become the second most expensive piece of American
furniture ever sold.
</P>
<P>
   Now Stahl believes he has enough confidence in these two buyers
to jump his bidding in increments of $250,000. ``I'll push it along
a little,'' he thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five million, two hundred fifty thousand,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Though many people believe Samaha to be bidding for Johnson, he
has more than one client interested in this object. He is really
bidding for the secretary itself, which has worked the same spell
on him that it worked on Leslie Keno.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me a couple of days before it all came together,''
Samaha will say. ``There are not many things that will move me at
this point like that one did. I just thought it was one of the
absolutely most important masterpieces of American furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   The bidding between Samaha and the telephone reaches $6 million
_ back and forth and up and up in quarter-million-dollar jumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven million, two hundred fifty thousand'' Stahl says to
Samaha.
</P>
<P>
   He nods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven million, five hundred thousand,'' Stahl asks the
telephone. Few of the experts in the room know who that is on the
phone. Leslie Keno will not say.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   1740s: Nathaniel Appleton, pastor of the First Congregational
Church in Cambridge, Mass., with land holdings in Massachusetts and
what will be Maine and Vermont, who is said to be ``venerable for
his piety'' and to live ``quietly'' on his minister's salary
(though ``very merry at whist''), orders a secretary bookcase that
is perhaps the most lavish and expensive piece of furniture ever
commissioned in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Townsend, a Quaker joiner of Newport, R.I., and
patriarch of the distinguished Townsend family of cabinetmakers,
fashions a masterpiece entirely of rare ``plum pudding'' mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Casey, a young silversmith of Exeter, R.I., who later
escaped a sentence of hanging for counterfeiting coins, casts the
silver handles for Appleton's secretary bookcase, the only such
hardware ever discovered on a piece of American furniture.
</P>
<P>
   1784: Appleton dies in Cambridge at 91, leaving the secretary
bookcase to his eldest son, Nathaniel, and his son's wife, Rachel
Henderson Appleton. The younger Nathaniel, 53, a former Son of
Liberty who paid 50 pounds sterling to avoid service in the
revolutionary army, is now a wealthy Boston businessman with
interests in shipping and real estate.
</P>
<P>
   1804: Following the death of her husband in 1798, Rachel
Appleton dies in Boston, perhaps having sent the secretary bookcase
to her eldest surviving son, John, 46, who is the U.S. consul in
Calais, France. John has had two children out of wedlock _
including his eldest son, John James Appleton _ with Mary
Whitbread, an Englishwoman who subsequently will marry an English
officer named Major Petrie and is known to all the Appleton family
as Aunt Petrie. Three years later, John will marry Sarah
Fayerweather of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   1829: John Appleton, 71, dies in Rennes, France, leaving the
secretary bookcase as part of a rich estate to his son John James,
37, a Harvard graduate, diplomat and former secretary to the U.S.
legations at Portugal and Spain. He is now the U.S. charge
d'affaires to Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   1864: John James Appleton, 72, dies in Rennes, leaving the
secretary to his 18-year-old son, Charles-Louis.
</P>
<P>
   1935: Charles-Louis Appleton, a law professor in Lyon, France,
dies at 89, leaving the secretary to his son Henri.
</P>
<P>
   1999: Nathaniel Appleton's descendants sell the secretary
bookcase at Sotheby's for $8,250,500, the second-highest price ever
paid for a piece of American furniture.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, residents of Salt Lake City awakened to a burst of
heavy snow as a potent jet stream disturbance crossed through the
central Rockies. Thursday, the disturbance will emerge onto the
Plains, setting the stage for a round of volatile weather.
</P>
<P>
   As a cold front associated with the disturbance encounters a
fast flow of humid air from the Gulf of Mexico, a line of very
strong thunderstorms will erupt from eastern Texas to eastern
Kansas. A few of the storms will spawn hail and destructive winds.
Isolated tornadoes are also possible. The storms will press east
during the day, reaching the southern and middle Mississippi Valley
toward evening.
</P>
<P>
   Sharply falling temperatures behind the front will combine with
residual moisture to produce a narrow swath of wet snow from
central Kansas to southern Minnesota. Accumulations will generally
range from 2 to 6 inches though gusty winds will cause considerable
drifting of the snow.
</P>
<P>
   Strengthening breezes from the south will direct unseasonably
warm air northward into the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes on
Thursday. Indeed, afternoon readings will reach the 60s as far
north as southern Michigan. Partial sunshine and very warm
conditions will also reign across the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   After a chilly start, sunshine dimmed by cirrus clouds will
cover the Northeast and Middle Atlantic States where it will also
be mild.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, a stream of Pacific moisture will bring heavy rain
to the Olympic peninsula while sunshine and dry weather covers
California and the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Avalanche
</P>
<P>
   A large avalanche careened down a mountain slope near Reno,
Nev., on Tuesday. The avalanche followed in the wake of a major
snowstorm that raged in the Sierra Nevada the past few days. At
least 90 percent of all avalanches occur during or just after a
snowstorm. These snowslides are triggered in response to heavy snow
accumulating on steep slopes. There are two kinds of avalanches. A
loose-snow avalanche begins at a point and then grows as it
cascades down the mountain, while a slab avalanche occurs when a
large rectangular slab of snow breaks free and slides down a slope.

   Q. I see wavy lines on my monitor. Could my computer's speakers
be the cause?
</P>
<P>
   A. Try moving the speakers farther from the monitor and see if
the distortion goes away. If you are using speakers designed for
audio components, not speakers marketed for use with a computer,
the problem may be magnetic interference.
</P>
<P>
   Most computer speakers are magnetically shielded so they do not
distort the picture on your monitor, while many types of speakers
used with traditional audio equipment are not. It is probably a
good idea to buy speakers that are designed for use with a computer
anyway because some stereo speakers cannot pick up the audio signal
very well from a computer's sound card.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a subwoofer hooked up for extra-nice audio, try
moving it farther away from the monitor as well. Subwoofers, a
favorite accessory of those who like an enhanced bass sound, are
usually not magnetically shielded either.
</P>
<P>
   Many other types of electrical devices positioned too close to
your computer can also cause distorted, wavy lines to appear on the
monitor. Small desk fans or other appliances can affect it, as can
another monitor that is too close to your own. Power supply boxes
from certain external devices, like Zip drives, can also affect the
picture on the computer's screen if they are plugged in too close
to the computer.

 Clifford A. Pearson is a senior editor of Architectural Record and
the author of ``Indonesia: Design and Culture'' (Monacelli Press,
1998). 
By CLIFFORD A. PEARSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  ISEH, Indonesia _ Hugo Jereissati, a wealthy Brazilian, fell in
love with Bali on his first trip to Indonesia in 1976. But only in
the last two years has he been able to live in a house with perhaps
the best view on the island. The little stucco house, in eastern
Bali, packs a lot of history and serves up a classic Balinese
scene: terraced rice fields and Mount Agung, the volcano that is
the island's most important natural feature.
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim nation, Bali is
predominantly Hindu. The Balinese worship Agung as the center of
their universe. When the long dormant volcano blew its top in 1963,
the lava flow destroyed much of the surrounding area but stopped
just short of Iseh, preserving this sleepy village.
</P>
<P>
   Jereissati's house was built in the 1930s as a studio and
mountain retreat for the German artist Walter Spies. Since then, it
has also been home to Theo Meier, a Swiss artist and playboy; a
wife of the local rajah, and the Italian writer Idanna Pucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house is pregnant with spirit and history,'' said Ms.
Pucci, who now divides her time between a new home nearby,
Florence, Italy and New York. Living in a historical house, though,
``can be a burden,'' she explained, especially one that until 1986
had a leaky roof, and until two years ago no electricity or running
water.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pucci first stayed at the compound in 1977 at the invitation
of its owner, a local prince. Though Ms. Pucci came to Bali to
write about Balinese painting, and had ``no mind to change
anything'' in the house, the roof and wood columns supporting it
were lazily rotting away in the humid air. By the time the prince
asked Ms. Pucci and Made Wijaya, a landscape architect born in
Australia as Michael White, to restore the house in 1986, it had to
be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   New wood columns with lotus-leaf capitals were carved, new roof
joists cut, new split-bamboo eaves woven, new ceramic floor tiles
installed _ all done with traditional materials and techniques. Ms.
Pucci and Wijaya also added a larger terrace for taking in the
spectacular view of Mount Agung and opened the original Spies
studio to the new terrace. ``The most essential thing about the
house has always been the view,'' Ms. Pucci said.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years it has been Hugo Jereissati's turn to
enjoy the view and make a few improvements. (Foreigners are not
allowed to own property in Bali, though they are allowed to take
out long-term leases.) ``I've tried to keep the original character
of the house as much as possible,'' he said. ``To do otherwise
would have been a scandal. Mostly, I've made it more comfortable.''
That has meant wiring the house for electricity, installing modern
plumbing, building a white stucco water tower out back and trading
in the old Balinese charcoal-fired stove for Western kitchen
appliances. For the first time, guests can enjoy hot showers.
</P>
<P>
   From the road, there are no clues alerting visitors to the view
that lies beyond the small entry and car port typical of any
Balinese family compound. But once inside the gate, guests find
themselves in a tranquil Asian garden with koi pond, frangipani and
hibiscus. To one side is a guest cottage with a columned walkway.
On the other side is the master bedroom wing. Straight ahead is the
original Spies studio and the drop-dead view of the volcano.
</P>
<P>
   Jereissati, 44, works as a consultant for Amanresorts, which has
three luxury hotels on Bali as well as properties in Thailand, the
Philippines, Myanmar and Europe. (The company recently opened its
first resort in the United States, the Amangani, in Jackson Hole,
Wyo.) A large man with an easy manner, Jereissati showed visitors
around his house wearing a colorful Balinese sarong, plaid shirt
and plastic flip-flops. Thick-rimmed glasses give him the look of a
tropical Peter Sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his love for the island, Jereissati left in the early
1980s and didn't return for five years. ``I thought Bali was
finished,'' he said. ``They had just built the first supermarket.
When I came back, I fell in love all over again.'' He laughed.
``Now, they have 50 supermarkets.''
</P>
<P>
   What keeps him enthralled are the Balinese people and their
culture. Spies, whose studio is Jereissati's dining pavilion, was
important in keeping that culture vibrant. Painter, choreographer,
musicologist, collector and bon vivant, Spies was a cofounder of
Bali's first artists' association and the curator of Bali's first
museum. After being rounded up during World War II because of his
German citizenship, he was killed in 1942 when Japanese planes sank
the boat on which he was being transported.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spies was a Renaissance man beamed down into prewar Bali,''
said Rio Helmi, a Bali resident and photographer, who is
responsible for such books as ``Bali Style'' (Vendome Press, 1996).
Spies also marketed Bali as a tropical paradise to Europeans hungry
for the exotic.
</P>
<P>
   To get away from a busy social life at his primary home in the
arts-oriented town of Ubud, Spies would escape periodically for the
two-to-three-hour drive to Iseh. Here, he found some property with
a stone shrine on it and a view that would inspire several of his
paintings. What he built was just one small, hip-roofed stucco
cube. The expanded celadon-tiled viewing terrace now connects it to
a small kitchen building on one side and a bedroom cottage on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent residents have, like Spies, eschewed neo-Balinese
kitsch and kept the architecture clean and quiet. Decorative
elements like carved and painted wood doors and window trim provide
a few welcome flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Hugo has done is give it the sense of one house,'' Ms.
Pucci said.

</P>
<P>
   Jereissati has imprinted the house with what Wijaya calls an
``estancia Brasilica'' style, which incorporates subtle and
original paint finishes to walls, doors and architraves, as is done
in country homes in South America.
</P>
<P>
   Helmi said that Jereissati's house ``has become kind of a
symbolic center of the genteel side of the interaction between the
West and Bali, with a touch of jet set and a pinch of glamour.'' As
beautiful as the setting is in Iseh, the weather this time of year
can be more like Seattle than St.-Tropez. ``Sometimes it's very
beautiful to be in Iseh during the rains,'' Jereissati said. ``But
other times it's just too wet.'' So, he makes the drive to south
Bali, where he has a ``funky bungalow'' on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the house in Iseh that exerts a pull. ``Hugo has
opened everything up and made comfortable the secret hideaway,''
Helmi said. But, he added, ``the house has always had something
special.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Rustika, 63 Crosby St., (212) 965-0004, and Boca
Grande, 66 Greene St., (212) 334-6120, sell Balinese items. Zen Zen
Garden and Home in Studio City, Calif., can provide sources
nationwide for Balinese bamboo and baskets, (888) 769-9705.

TUNEUPS FOR THE YOUNG BRAIN: TRY THIS AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARGOT SLADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doing what comes naturally is how many parents define thinking,
a kind of hard-wired inborn process applied like a lens to
different subjects to bring them into focus. In this way, we learn.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality, educators have been discovering, is that
thinking can be taught and, indeed, must be taught.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thinking is a kind of overlord of academia,'' said Arthur
Pober, an educational psychologist who conducts workshops
nationally on thinking skills. ``What many grown-ups don't
understand is that learning math and reading, social studies and
science, music, woodworking, block-building or art doesn't teach
youngsters how to think. Just the reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning to think ``should be a distinct component of the school
curriculum and a distinct activity at home,'' Pober said. He added,
``Children can then use those skills to better understand other
subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators essentially agree that thinking comprises a cluster of
elements: memory; cognition, or learning; decision making, and
problem solving. Learning includes the ability to understand
information _ whether it is a letter, word, sentence or concept,
presented visually or aurally _ and to explain it to others.
</P>
<P>
   And problem solving means being able to move from Step A to B to
C _ and knowing how to be more creative, solving problems when the
original plan does not work.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, specialists in early childhood education and
software developers have recognized that the computer is perfectly
configured to teach such things. Learning a skill requires
practice, reinforcement, repetition and reintroduction in different
forms and settings so that children thoroughly understand and
master it before they lose interest. A computer is good at all of
those things, and it doesn't get angry, can't get impatient and
never gets bored.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with the right software, the computer will give
feedback in the form of hints, praise and suggested alternatives.
It will offer children repeated opportunities to acquire, practice
and improve a skill. And it will do so using a variety of settings
and variable levels of difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   How can parents determine whether a particular product is right
for a child? They cannot always thumb through a brochure and do not
necessarily have access to a software company's Web site; even if
they do, the site may not offer a glimpse of the software in
question. Sometimes the only guidance, then, is the box.
</P>
<P>
   The descriptive material should tell parents the age group for
which the product was designed. It should also describe the
activity and the types of skills being developed, educators say.
Make sure the rating is appropriate, if it has one. Check the
graphics: youngsters today have sophisticated taste in animation.
</P>
<P>
   Seek out software that offers children the opportunity to
acquire and practice skills in various ways and allows parents or
children to adjust the level of play. But also look for products,
like those reviewed here, that are fun and that develop thinking
skills using familiar characters from books or television or
present comfortable, homelike settings.
</P>
<P>
   There is one catch. No software will be ``right'' if parents
abandon their children to it. Parents must be present at the
computer, said Pober, who is the executive director of the
Entertainment Software Rating Board and devised the product rating
system used by the video-game and interactive software industries
along with a new rating system for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents should at least be offering encouragement to their
kids,'' he said. ``But they will also want to observe how their
children learn, what their children are responding to so that they
can create follow-up games and activities the whole family can
pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   It is parents, he added, who must gauge a child's mood and call
it a day before fun turns into a lesson in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Thinkin' Things Collection 3 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Edmark Corporation; $40; Macintosh 7.0.1 or later, and Windows
3.1 enhanced mode and Windows 95 or later; ages 7 to 13.)
</P>
<P>
   This program should come with a message to parents that says
``Open Me First'' before they buy any other thinking-skills
software. To begin with, there is a ``Dear Parents'' presentation
in which a longtime teacher, who is an Edmark executive, discusses
what thinking is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the User's Guide _ not your usual bare-bones
outline of how each of five learning activities is played. Rather,
this guide provides minilessons about how children learn and what
each of this product's five activities is supposed to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   The activities are terrific: beautifully designed (Edmark has
always been strong on graphics), challenging, intellectually
engaging and, yes, just plain fun.
</P>
<P>
   Stocktopus, an Octopus stockbroker, for example, guides children
as they decide on increasingly complex trades of ``commodities''
like sunflowers, soccer balls, apples and tires to achieve
portfolio goals. The User's Guide list of ``learning
opportunities'' includes identifying multiple solutions to problems
and predicting a series of outcomes. If children are tempted to
make the first trade they see, the ``About Kids'' advice to parents
suggests encouraging them ``to think ahead _ to consider which
trade will provide the greatest benefit further down the
problem-solving path.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Carving Blox is an experiment in mechanics that
uses a malleable sheet of virtual metal and six virtual balls of
different masses. Children try out assorted tools to shape the
metal, then set the balls in motion to explore how gravity,
friction, motion and inertia work.
</P>
<P>
   The text advises parents to recreate these experiments with
objects found at home, using books as ramps, for example, and
sandpaper and wax paper as textured surfaces that affect motion. It
is a welcome reminder that computers are one of many learning tools
and no substitute for the real thing, although this seductively
easy-to-use workshop comes pretty close.
</P>
<P>
   Other activities include Half Time, an introduction to computer
programming in which children choreograph football players,
cheerleaders and a marching band for a halftime show; Fripple
Place, in which Fripples must be placed in the correct room
according to their characteristics (finding the right home for the
curly-haired critter with sunglasses and green stripes, and a
different home for its curly-haired cousin with big feet), and
Photo Twister, which allows children to think visually and
immediately experience cause and effect as they diabolically
distort photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are urged to check on their children's progress from
session to session, adjusting levels of difficulty accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   There is encouragement aplenty here, with endearingly weird
creatures cheering on players and a Hint button if a player is
really stuck. That goes for grown-ups, too, who have been spotted
firing up their own brain cells with Thinkin' Things Collection 1
(ages 4 to 8), Collection 2 (ages 6 to 12) and Collection 3 long
after their children's lights are out.

<P>
   Blue's Birthday Adventure &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Humongous Entertainment; $29.99; Macintosh Power PC, System 7.1
or later, and Windows 95 and 98; ages 3 to 6.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All the genius of ``Blue's Clues,'' the much acclaimed preschool
television program, has made its way into this clever think-along
CD-ROM. Children help the dog named Blue and her owner, Steve _ our
human guide through a cut-paper landscape _ prepare for Blue's
birthday party: What does Blue want to give her guests? What does
she want to eat? To play? Each question is a problem to be solved
by finding three clues, each marked by _ what else _ a blue paw
print.
</P>
<P>
   Children work through nine activities, each of which can be set
to a different skill level. Although only one child at a time is
the designated ``player,'' the reality is more accommodating. Other
youngsters can join in as a kind of reason-aloud team.
</P>
<P>
   Parents know this is child-wise territory when a voice asks the
player to sign in, typing the child's name, birth date and favorite
color, and the information typed in is read aloud by kids' voices.
The player's name will appear throughout the session on
refrigerator magnets, gift tags and birthday cards. And Steve
speaks and gestures directly to the players, all but breaking
through the screen.
</P>
<P>
   As you might suspect, finding clues is not as simple as it
sounds, at least not at the most advanced of the three levels of
play. Two 5-year-olds kept one intermediate game going for more
than an hour. Side trips include helping two other characters named
Salt and Mrs. Pepper measure, mix and bake a birthday cake. The
youngest players will need help here.
</P>
<P>
   Changing the level of difficulty creates a new playing field for
each activity. But solutions and clues stay the same, which
suggests there will be a limit _ however distant _ to a child's
eagerness to play Blue's Clues.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a thoughtful piece of software. Decisions are
reviewed, clues repeated and hints, where necessary, dropped.
Praise borders on the lavish. And when all the clues are in,
everyone repairs to the Thinking Chair to consider _ out loud _
alternative solutions. Smart. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brain &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Knowledge Adventure; $30; Windows 95 or later; ages 9 and up.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Warning to children who like to rip open a software box,
disregard the instructions, install the thing and start: Don't _ at
least not with Dr. Brain. Take it from one who usually does that,
and did. Finding a patterned path through a potentially deadly
flower bed while reading about weaponry, puzzle patterns and the
other how to's of completing a mission is not fun, I assure you.
</P>
<P>
   But after imprinting on my brain things like the difference
between symbol reflex puzzles (make a pair match on three
characteristics by clicking through the possible combinations _
take too many moves and you're zapped), working through Dr. Brain's
IQ Adventure became an addictive, fast learning-curve blast.
</P>
<P>
   The story line is simple: Marooned in an alternate universe, you
are pursued by robots trying to harness humankind's brain power. To
save yourself and return to Earth, you must recover pieces of your
interdimensional transport machine before the robots rebuild the
transport as a gateway to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   You'll pass through a jungle, wasteland, cavern and metropolis
and complete 15 missions. Along the way, you'll converse with
locals and collect useful items and devices while using weapons and
wits (and brain food).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brain could be more helpful with some of the information and
hints he provides. And I, for one, could have used more time to
think through some puzzles. But this is a minor weakness in a
fast-moving problem-solving skills game that you can play over the
Internet with friends or against up to three others. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Putt-Putt Enters the Race &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Humongous Entertainment; $29.99; Macintosh Power PC, System 7.1
or later, and Windows 3.1 and later; ages 3 to 8.) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If there are young children out there who are not enchanted by
cars or construction equipment, I have yet to meet them. And this
CD-ROM has plenty of both, charmingly drawn in crayon colors. The
latest in a series featuring Putt-Putt, a little purple
convertible, and his dog, Pep, it offers friends from earlier
CD-ROMs, like Smokey the Fire Engine and Outback Al, along with new
Cartown characters and locations: Torvil Tractor and his farm,
Rover and his Rocket Drive-in.
</P>
<P>
   The format is a familiar one in the world of thinking skills. To
race in the Cartown 500, Putt-Putt must take four items to Redline
Rick at the race track: extra high-powered high-octane gas and a
container for the backup supply, four super-speedy radial racing
tires, a safety helmet for Pep and a triangular flag.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the items requires children to explore in and around
Cartown, to identify numbers, shapes, objects and letters, and to
recall what they have observed: those scissors in the library, for
example, will come in handy when patching Chuck the tow truck's
flat.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, children help Putt-Putt overcome obstacles: a
labyrinth of a garden, for example, from which he must harvest
certain vegetables and fruit. They solve problems, like how to lure
Fenderbender's cat out of the basement. And they must collect
objects in anticipation of a trade.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of ``click points'' here _ too many, perhaps.
Children may take so many detours to see what's under a bush or in
the barn that they lose track of the game. Hints for stymied young
explorers are far between. Nor can the level of difficulty be
adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   Adults may also be tempted on occasion to help with the cursor,
which must be right on the target object to register a correct
response.
</P>
<P>
   The software does have one nifty feature, however: Parents can
freeze a particularly frustrating game and store it for another day
and a clearer head. And there's a payoff. Children can actually
race Putt-Putt around the speedway, zooming down straightaways,
easing out of turns and zigzagging around oil slicks.

FOUR YOUNG LAWYERS WHO LEFT LASTING IMPRESSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For Release Sunday, Feb. 14)   (For Use By New York Times News Service Clients  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c. 1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As four American presidents gathered with other
world leaders to bid farewell to Jordan's King Hussein last week,
younger men who hope to be America's leaders of tomorrow made a
final, desperate bid to oust Bill Clinton from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The younger men, Republican House members, accepted defeat like
champions who exit the field of battle promising to be victorious
when they next enter the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom dictates that in the aftermath of the
aborted impeachment drive, the Republicans will suffer and
Democrats will prosper at the hands of the voters. But conventional
wisdom can be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who watched the impeachment proceedings with an open mind
had to be impressed by the demeanor, dedication and potential of
four young House managers under the tutelage of eloquent
74-year-old Henry Hyde. They led the charge against Clinton and, in
doing so, made clear to the nation that they possess the qualities
to become leaders of the future.
</P>
<P>
   They are James Rogan of California, Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas,
Edward Bryant of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
They are very different in personality and background but in their
respect for the rule of law, they stand as one.
</P>
<P>
   Watching them make their legal and moral case against the
president, my mind raced back across the decades to first steps
toward fame and glory taken by Republicans of the World War II
generation.
</P>
<P>
   In those impeachment prosecutors, I could see young Richard
Nixon, pressing his investigation of Alger Hiss, young Gerald Ford,
beginning his climb up the House leadership ladder, young Bob Dole,
overcoming severe war injuries to launch a successful political
career and young Howard Baker, who during the Watergate probe a
quarter century ago demanded repeatedly to learn what the president
knew and when he knew it.
</P>
<P>
   The argument of the four impeachment prosecutors was that the
current president is not above the law, that he lied and obstructed
justice to cover up his misdeeds and that he is a lousy role model
for American youth.
</P>
<P>
   We can argue endlessly as to whether Clinton committed the high
crimes and misdemeanors which the Constitution decrees should cost
him his presidency. But we cannot argue about the passion and
perception that the young prosecutors brought to the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   They, like Hyde and other members of the prosecution team,
contended that senators voting on the articles of impeachment
should not be swayed by public opinion polls showing that a vast
majority of Americans opposed ouster of the president. But that is
a difficult argument to uphold in a democracy where the will of the
people is supposedly the rule of the land.
</P>
<P>
   On both sides of the historic dispute, there were men and women
who acquitted themselves with honor and brilliance.
</P>
<P>
   No members of the Senate fought harder to find a fair and
honorable way out of the impeachment morass than California's
Dianne Feinstein, Texas' Kay Bailey Hutchison and Maine's Susan
Collins and Olympia Snow.
</P>
<P>
   No members worked harder at trying to steer clear of the narrow
partisanship that prevailed during the House debate on impeachment
than Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi and Minority Leader
Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the final analysis, it was the young House lawyers who,
even in defeat, left the most lasting impression.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of history's ironies that as they were making their
case against Clinton, he and three of his predecessors were on a
somber mission to Amman to pay their last respects to a fallen
comrade in the crusade for peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The farewell to Hussein brought together leaders who have made
their mark on history but who in the passage of time will become
history themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, although only 52, has less than two years left in his
battered presidency. The former presidents who flew with him to
Jordan, Gerald Ford, 85, and Jimmy Carter and George Bush, both 74,
have seen power shift to younger hands.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin, the ailing chief of once-mighty Russia, was so
feeble he had to be led in and out of the palace where Hussein's
coffin stood. Yassir Arafat reportedly showed signs of failing
health. Hosni Mubarak was vigorous but 70 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from the scene, either because of death, retirement or
defeat, were the men and women who but a few years ago were the
prime movers on the world scene: Britain's Margaret Thatcher,
Germany's Helmut Kohl, France's Francois Mitterrand and Israel's
Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after Edward VII's funeral in 1910, World War I began
and four years after that many of the monarchs who had ridden
proudly through London's streets at his funeral pageant, including
Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm, were but a part of history.
</P>
<P>
   So it will be one day with those who marched through the palace
grounds behind Hussein's coffin in 1999. And chances are that the
leadership torch will have been passed to those young lawyers whose
mark will remain indelibly on the trial that Henry Hyde described
as ``this melancholy procedure.''

`MY FAVORITE MARTIAN' PROJECTS ARE WORLDS APART FOR WALSTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ray Walston had mixed feelings about taking on the
role of the original ``Favorite Martian'' in the early '60s. A
Broadway star who had leading roles in ``Damn Yankees'' and ``South
Pacific'' in the 1950s, Walston recalls colleagues warning him
about playing an alien on the relatively young medium of
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took the job, a lot of people in Hollywood said,
`You're crazy, don't do this,' '' Walston confesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martian'' did prove a success, though, soon after hitting the
air. The year was 1963: The United States had landed its first
space probe on the moon the year before and was preparing to launch
a probe that would photograph Mars. The idea of a Martian landing
on Earth enthralled viewers.
</P>
<P>
   A big-screen version of the TV show hits theaters this Friday.
It stars Christopher Lloyd and Jeff Daniels, but the 81-year-old
Walston has an amusing role. While the new movie employs the latest
in special-effects wizardry, techniques were primitive on the
original show. ``They used fishing poles to do the levitation
scenes,'' reveals Walston. ``They put a motorized contraption on my
back, to make my antannae go up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   The show quickly departed, though, from its original
semi-serious take on a Martian stranded on Earth, Walston says.
``They started appealing more to kids, and had the Martian talk
with every kind of known animal from the barnyard,'' Walston
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would put something sweet in my ear,'' Walston continues,
``and the animal would approach me and lick my ear. It would look
like the animal was `talking' to me, and I would translate to the
boy (the late Bill Bixby, who co-starred in the show with Walston).
And I thought, I came from Broadway to do this?''
</P>
<P>
   Walston put a halt to this technique after being mauled by a
chimp. ``He went berserk and chewed my face to pieces,'' Walston
says. ``After that, I said no more animals of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   After the show went off the air in 1966, Walston stayed busy as
an actor in theater, television and films. He had memorable roles
in movies, from ``Paint Your Wagon'' to ``Popeye,'' and won two
Emmy Awards for his role of Judge Bone in TV's ``Picket Fences.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that though he still enjoys working in each medium, he
more recently has preferred films for their leisurely schedule.
``They take their time _ the pace isn't as hectic as television,''
Walston says. ``In television, the hours have gotten out of hand.
They work people from very early morning to late at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Walston adds with a laugh: ``But I really only have one
preference now: I don't want to work anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't take that too seriously, though. He delivers the line with
the mischievous glee that has been his trademark for decades.

   Back when the culture of instant digital gratification was just
a gleam in a futurist's eye, a revolutionary device was invented
that was one of the first steps toward technological power for
consumers: the remote control.
</P>
<P>
   It changed everything. ``The twitch of our fingers on TV remotes
was the first sign of slumbering interactive desires,'' said Paul
Saffo, a director at the Institute for the Future, in Menlo Park,
Calif. ``The remote control wasn't just a new way to change
channels. It changed TV as a medium. Suddenly you didn't have to
watch shows.'' Viewers could channel surf instead. They could watch
several programs at once, have their senses assaulted by sounds and
images and, best of all, they could skip the commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for the remote control was as much to silence
advertisements as to let viewers remain on the couch. The founder
of Zenith Electronics Corp., Eugene F. McDonald Jr., said he
thought advertisements would be the death of the nascent television
medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to prove his point by making commercials
unprofitable,'' said Dr. Robert Adler, the Zenith engineer who
created the first practical wireless remote control, which used
ultrasonic signals and went on the market in 1956. More than 9
million televisions with ultrasonic remote controls were sold in 25
years, according to Zenith. But the remote control had a different
effect. It forced advertisers to create spots that were more clever
so they could capture the attention of viewers as they clicked
through the channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the remote, the advertisers had you as their hostage,''
Saffo said. ``They knew you weren't going to get up.''
</P>
<P>
   Adler's creation, called the Space Command, was mechanical. It
literally clicked, or pinged, when a button was pushed. It used an
ultrasonic beam, outside the range of human hearing, to turn a set
on or off or change the channel.
</P>
<P>
   The price for a set and a remote control ranged from $259.95 for
a tabletop model to $550 for a high-end console - hefty price tags
back then. Advertisements for the Space Command proclaimed that
there was ``nothing between you and the set but space!'' Some ads
went on to say: ``Is it magic? It's like nothing you have ever seen
before - anywhere!''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't magic, but it was a big step beyond Zenith's earlier
remote controls. The first such control, marketed in 1950, was the
inelegant but aptly named Lazy Bones. It was tethered to the set by
a long wire, which made it a living-room hazard. The next version,
in 1955, was wireless. It was essentially a flashlight that changed
the channels when it was focused on sensors built into the cabinet
of a set. Thus its name: the Flashmatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a sunny day you had to turn it off because the tuner would
just go crazy,'' Adler recalled in a telephone interview.
Disadvantages aside, more than 30,000 Flashmatics were sold.
</P>
<P>
   The first remote controls seemed to be ahead of their time
because there were few stations to flip through in the '50s. ``It's
surprising how early this technology was created,'' said Ronald C.
Simon, a curator at the Museum of Television and Radio in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   It took awhile for the remote control to catch on. Among the
televisions sold in 1976, 9.5 percent had remote controls; by 1990,
90 percent of them did. But the advent of the remote control was a
big step toward the couch potato culture to come. Viewers could
stay put while they watched, orchestrating their viewing like
maestros with batons, while what they watched came at them at a
faster pace. Over time, there were more channels and shows than
ever before, more than it seemed possible to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge magnetic force in the culture and it goes
toward speed, and the remote control was an essential element in
that direction,'' said Todd Gitlin, a professor of media studies at
New York University. `` `Move it along' _ that's what matters. The
speed of movement and the juxtaposition of different images is
absolutely central to how people are living now.''

   DROWNED ASPARAGUS
</P>
<P>
   Serves 2
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound asparagus spears
</P>
<P>
   1 cup soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   2-3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2-3 cloves garlic, pressed
</P>
<P>
   Snap off or trim the tough bottom portion of asparagus spears.
Place in glass loaf pan, cover with plastic wrap and microwave for
3 minutes, or until slightly bendable. Refresh under cold water.
</P>
<P>
   Place in flat bowl, or back in loaf pan. Combine remaining
ingredients and pour over asparagus. Serve at room temperature.
Make this dish before starting the entree. It does not keep well
overnight because the dressing eats up the asparagus. The dressing,
however, can be drained off and stored in the refrigerator for a
later batch of asparagus.

</P>
<P>
   Fetzer was a pioneer in producing red wines that were both
substantial and easy to like. That tradition continues with this
``barrel select'' merlot.
</P>
<P>
   This 100 percent merlot ($14.99) was fashioned from grapes
picked in four north-coast counties and aged for 13 months.
``Barrel select'' in this case means that much of this wine was
aged in French oak barrels made at nearby Mendocino Cooperage,
where the barrels are toasted to winemaker specifications.
</P>
<P>
   What has emerged after a brief period in the bottle is a ripe
cherry-flavored, friendly wine with a long, vanilla-tinged finish.
This wine will also enhance a winter meal of stew or roast beef as
well as vegetable or meat-sauced pastas.

   MUSSELS COOKED IN CALVADOS, APPLE CIDER AND CREAM
</P>
<P>
   Serves 2
</P>

   In a saucepan just large enough to hold the mussels, combine the
cider, cream, 6 tablespoons Calvados, salt, shallots and 1 teaspoon
parsley. Bring to a boil, stirring to blend ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Add the mussels, cover the pan and cook, shaking the pan several
times, until the mussels have opened, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer
mussels with a slotted spoon to a bowl, discarding any that remain
unopen. Add a little hot broth and cover the bowl to keep the
mussels warm.

<P>
   And from the white side of our wine list ...
</P>
<P>
   Every now and then a wine appears that is so admirable and
pleasing that it becomes a benchmark. So it is with this chardonnay
from Matanzas Creek.
</P>
<P>
   This is a textbook Northern California chardonnay from a
splendid vintage. Very high-quality fruit was given the red-carpet
treatment in the winery. That means full malolactic fermentation to
provide buttery richness; aging on the lees in small oak barrels
adds complexity.
</P>
<P>
   The wine, still evolving, is a pretty gold color with an aroma
of apple, vanilla and lemon. There's citrus, too, but it doesn't
dominate the fruit. The final impression is of balance and harmony.
Wine this well-made doesn't come cheap: $30 a bottle.

A fan letter to Patricia Cornwell, mystery writer 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Patricia Cornwell:
</P>
<P>
   I hope you understand how hard it is for me to write these
words. You're a bestselling novelist, and I'm just a fan, but I
wanted you to hear from me why I won't be buying any more of your
books.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia, it's over between us.
</P>
<P>
   I know you're upset. So am I. But I've been thinking a lot since
I read your new book, ``Southern Cross,'' and I honestly think this
is the best thing for both of us. Just hear me out.
</P>
<P>
   Where to start.... We had some good times, didn't we?
</P>
<P>
   I remember back in 1990, when your first Kay Scarpetta mystery
came out. That Scarpetta, chief medical examiner for the
Commonwealth of Virginia: Now, she was a protagonist you could grow
old with. Intelligent, complicated and tough on serial killers.
Then there was Marino, the sidekick cop. And Lucy, Scarpetta's
niece. Boy, those were the days.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Body of Evidence'' followed ``Postmortem,'' I finished it
in a day. When ``All That Remains'' and ``Cruel and Unusual'' came
out later, I was among the first to buy them. I stayed up late to
finish ``The Body Farm'' and ``Cause of Death.'' I couldn't wait to
see Scarpetta catch the killers in ``Unnatural Exposure,'' ``From
Potter's Field'' and ``Point of Origin.''
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't put you down. You had good guys, bad guys, pacing,
plot, close calls, everything a man wants in a mystery. Then you
found somebody new.
</P>
<P>
   Did you think I wouldn't notice when ``Hornet's Nest'' appeared
in 1997 and there was this female police chief, acting tough and
intelligent and complicated as if she was Scarpetta? Well, I
noticed, and so did others. But I forgave you.
</P>
<P>
   I told myself you were trying to be writerly. I said maybe you
needed to sow your oats or be alone or whatever; it was OK with me
_ the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how I felt when I opened your new book, and it's not
Scarpetta but this other woman. And it's not even a mystery. I'm on
Page 24, and nobody's died yet. Page 190, still nothing. Nobody
even fires a gun until Page 212.
</P>
<P>
   This is a satire or a spoof or social commentary. This is what a
fan deserves?
</P>
<P>
   You know, it's not only me. Have you looked at Amazon.com
lately, at the reviews? There's this one from Georgia: ``I've read
them all with great enjoyment but this one just wouldn't fly.''
This from Oregon: ``Disappointed!!!'' And this from Tennessee: ``It
was a completely different type of novel and had it been written by
any author other than Cornwell, I probably would not have bought
it. From now on, I'll just wait for the next Scarpetta novel.''
</P>
<P>
   So with these words, I say goodbye, Patricia Cornwell. I hope
you find what you're looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Fondly,
</P>
<P>
   A fan
</P>
<P>
   P.S.: Did I tell you I'm seeing someone new? I've been reading a
book by James Patterson. He's got this detective, Alex Cross, and
so far, so good. I think we'll be happy together.
</P>

HOUSING AS DESTINY ON `MELROSE PLACE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICK MARIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In three months, the Fox network will evict prime time's most
feared, most microskirted landlord, Heather Locklear's Amanda
Parezi Woodward Burns Blake McBride _ with her latest husband,
Kyle, her sometime paramour, Peter, the scheming Michael, and his
crazy ex-hooker ex-wife, Megan.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation of ``Melrose Place'' in May, announced last
week, is likely to provoke a rash of magazine tributes and specials
on E! saluting the seven-year-old series as addictive soap opera
and camp classic. But maybe the real appeal of ``Melrose'' is not
just the guilty, sometimes kinky pleasure of living vicariously
through beautiful people with big problems, but also a different
kind of fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Dorm life, in adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   For most of us, college is the last time when all our friends,
lovers, enemies and nemeses live under one roof. Not so for the
revolving residents of ``Melrose,'' who continued to cohabit well
into their 30s in a cool building in Los Angeles with a pool.
</P>
<P>
   Their attenuated adolescence is our paradise lost. It's one
thing to have a ``Honeymooners''-style married couple upstairs or a
nut across the hall a la ``Seinfeld.'' In the sexier extended
``Melrose'' family, it's possible to know all your hot neighbors,
as well as to sleep with most of them. Thy neighbor's sex life
supplies the suds for every long-lasting bar of prime-time soap.
</P>
<P>
   But the genius of ``Melrose'' lies in housing almost all the
players in the same place. Which, not coincidentally, is how many
obsessive fans have watched it, huddled in tightly knit viewing
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   (``Friends,'' which started two years later, played off the same
neo-dorm construct, as did its failed Gen X clones.)
</P>
<P>
   The building itself is a Spanish colonial echo of the glamorous
garden apartments of Los Angeles (like the Villa d'Este, designed
in 1928 by the architect brothers F. Piermont Davis and Walter S.
Davis), but with one key anachronistic amenity: a pool. The walls
drip with bougainvillea, the patio with chlorinated puddles left by
lithe, tan bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The apartments themselves are nice, not lavish one-bedroom
backdrops for their owners' psychodramas. Amanda's leopard-print
sheets telegraph her core being, as Alexis Carrington's spiky
Memphis-style desk did on ``Dynasty'' _ another decade-defining
Aaron Spelling production.
</P>
<P>
   Spelling, the elfin mogul in charge of television's most
productive dream factory, knows a thing or two about fantasy
dwellings. He was able to build a 45-room, 56,500-square-foot
megahome of his own by turning cheesy television into, well,
fromage _ from ``Charlie's Angels'' to ``Fantasy Island'' to
``Beverly Hills 90210,'' off which ``Melrose'' was spun.
</P>
<P>
   The title was intended to evoke ``Peyton Place,'' said Darren
Star, 37, who created ``Melrose Place'' from his own experience as
a struggling writer-waiter in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in a courtyard apartment with a pool,'' he recalled
the other day. ``Most of the inhabitants were in their 20s. It was
that transitional period between college and becoming an adult.
Everybody had roommates. There was a lot of sex. It was one of
those '60s-era Motel 6-looking places. Really ugly.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Melrose'' idea of home looks like a classy motel.
</P>
<P>
   Star may not have realized it, but his tarted-up no-tell motel
is a descendant of ``Grand Hotel,'' said Donald Albrecht, adjunct
curator of the National Design Museum of the Smithsonian
Institution and a historian of film.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the Lubitsch films of the 1930s, certain kinds
of environments force social and sexual collisions, like the lobby
of a hotel,'' he said, alluding to Ernst Lubitsch, the
Hungarian-born director of ``Grand Hotel'' (1932).
</P>
<P>
   He sees the ``Melrose'' courtyard as one of those environments _
``a place where all the characters come out of their apartments and
meet each other,'' he said. ``There is this idea of spatial
proximity equaling easy sexual access.''
</P>
<P>
   Lubitsch, Albrecht also noted, ``did a lot with opening and
closing doors.'' As ``Melrose'' does. Characters are forever
catching one another sneaking in and out after their dangerous
liaisons.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that Lubitsch lifted from Georges Feydeau, the great
French farceur, and that the architectural footprint of Amanda's
complex dates back to the Roman villa. It appears that ``Melrose''
may tap into even deeper collective cultural memories than dorm
life.
</P>
<P>
   What does Spelling make of his creation? Through a spokesman, he
said that he would comment, on one condition. Disclosing that the
apartment complex is not real would be a deal breaker.
</P>
<P>
   Come on.
</P>
<P>
   A show that blew up the pool in an act of ratings desperation at
the end of last season demands to be considered realistic?
</P>
<P>
   Photographers and outside television crews may visit on the set,
only if they agree not to shoot rafters, boom mikes, craft services
food tables _ anything that would compromise the so-called fourth
wall of make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   So committed to this illusion is Spelling that he wants to
preserve it even now that ``Melrose'' is effectively dead. Agree to
his terms or no access to the ``Melrose'' cast or crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a philosophy in terms of creating an aura around the
show,'' explained Spelling's press agent, Kevin Sasaki. ``A
longstanding policy of all his shows is that _ whether it's
`Melrose' or a high school or a home _ it is a place where people
actually live.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Spelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melrose Place'' is filmed on three sound stages in an
industrial park in a Los Angeles exurb called Santa Clarita, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Mihaly, a former photo editor at Entertainment Weekly has
been there. ``It was a broiling hellhole,'' Ms. Mihaly said of the
time she spent on the set, supervising photography for a special
issue of the magazine. ``We called it `Hellrose.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, she agreed to the unusual restrictions. ``They were
totally like, `This is the only way it's going to happen, if you
don't show the tops of the walls,''' she said. ``We had to promise
to crop out all that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The real Melrose Place is half a block of decorator furniture
stores on the edge of Beverly Hills _ a bummer for the fans who
find it, though perhaps not as traumatizing as a trip to Santa
Clarita might be.
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Melrose'' slips into the afterlife of reruns, and
before all the props _ Ms. Locklear's stiletto heels, the condoms
Michael keeps next to his bed _ are looted or relegated to the
dustbin of history, Albrecht should see to it that some piece of
the series winds up at the Smithsonian.
</P>
<P>
   There is one true-life relic to be had out there, if anyone can
find it. The exterior wall used for establishing shots of the
show's address _ 4616 Melrose Place _ is a genuine piece of Los
Angeles real estate, Star said, though he would not give up the
location.
</P>

Legend is bigger than the real Ringo (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Johnny Ringo appears in the movie ``Tombstone.'' Was he a
real person or a fictional character? _ B.W., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: There was a real John Ringo, but he probably wasn't a
legendary gunfighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The true Johnny Ringo was merely a cattle rustler and
bushwhacker, not the steely-eyed quick-draw artist portrayed in
western literature,'' Gail Hahs writes on Discovery Channel Online.
</P>
<P>
   Ringo wasn't involved in the 1881 shootout outside the O.K.
Corral with the Earps and Doc Holliday, but he was a friend and
business associate of the men who were killed: Billy Clanton, Tom
McLaury and Frank McLaury.
</P>
<P>
   His only documented gunfight was an 1879 incident at an Arizona
tavern. Louis Hancock was grazed by a bullet fired by Ringo, but
criminal charges were dropped.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 book ``John Ringo: The Gunfighter Who Never Was,''
author Jack Burrows writes that the main source for Ringo's legend
was William Breakinridge, a deputy who hated the Earps.
</P>
<P>
   Ringo was found dead July 14, 1882, in Turkey Creek Canyon near
Tombstone. ``No one really knows how he died, although evidence
points to suicide,'' Hahs writes.

<P>
   Q: Was the movie ``That Thing You Do'' based on a '60s one-hit
wonder group or was it fiction? _ G.B., Granbury, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The Wonders and their only hit song were entirely fictional,
according to interviews with director Tom Hanks.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmakers listened to 300 versions of ``That Thing You Do!''
before settling on one by New York City songwriter Adam
Schlesinger.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 1964-era music from the film is real. ``A vast chunk
of that music has been co-opted by Madison Avenue,'' Hanks said in
an Oct. 11, 1996, ``Entertainment Weekly'' interview. ``You can't
escape this stuff because now it's being used to sell tennis shoes
and Pepsi.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks and producer Gary Goetzman composed several of the film's
songs, including Voyage Around the Moon and Mr. Downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The program ``Sightings'' featured a healer named ``Amazing
Grace'' from Danbury, Conn. Where can we write to her and find out
about her upcoming appearances? _ A.B.E., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Pastor Grace at Grace 'N Vessels of Christ
Ministries, Box 3257, Danbury, CT 06813-3257.

 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two new high-tech toys can help children shrink
images of themselves, and greatly magnify images of bugs and fleas
and the inside of the children's noses, then project all the images
onto a computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The toys, the Me2 Cam and the X3 Microscope, got a formal
introduction at this week's Toy Fair in Manhattan. They are both
products of a joint venture by Intel and Mattel, which said the
toys would be on the market in mid-September. The Me2 Cam lets
children literally lose themselves in video games. The toy, which
lists for $99, is a digital video camera that captures a child's
image, sends it to the computer through a Universal Serial Bus
port, and allows the child to appear inside a game. With the camera
trained on the game player, the child can move around and interact
with the animated objects in the game.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in a game called Bubble Factory, players get
points by popping bubbles that fall from the sky. To do that, the
child pokes and gestures in front of the digital camera, thus
manipulating the on-screen image. The game's software then
incorporates the image into the animated game play, enabling the
off-screen player to participate with the animation.
</P>
<P>
   In another game, Mountain Madness, players jump and tilt and
sway to navigate a snowboarding course.
</P>
<P>
   The X3 Microscope is also a digital camera that hooks up to a
computer. But instead of projecting a user's image onto the screen,
it magnifies tiny images up to 250 times and displays them on a
computer monitor in a live video feed.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Norris, project director of the Intel and Mattel toy
line, said the possibilities were numerous. ``Kids can look in
their mouths, ears, look at scabs, look at tattoos,'' she said.
``They can pick up bugs, pick the flea off the dog and instead of
squinting at it, go and put it under the microscope.''
</P>
<P>
   Free Faxes With a Catch
</P>
<P>
   Television viewers accept the fact that commercials subsidize
free programming, but will they accept advertising as a way to
support free faxes? A Silicon Valley company is banking that they
will, particularly if it means they do not have to buy an actual
fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   The company, eFax.com, this week began offering a service that
will direct a subscriber's incoming faxes to an e-mail address, not
a fax machine. A subscriber signs up with eFax for a personal fax
number. Calls made to that number will be routed through eFax in
Menlo Park, Calif., where they will be directed to a user's e-mail
address. The service is free, but the catch is that the faxes that
arrive in e-mail will be accompanied with four small banner
advertisements above each message.
</P>
<P>
   There are already services that direct faxes to e-mail accounts,
but this one is the first to try to use advertising to foot the
bill, said Ron Brown, vice president for eFax.com.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the service was aimed at mobile professionals who
could not sit by a fax machine waiting for a document, but he said
the company hoped that it would cut into the demand for home and
home-office fax machines. ``It's a pretty cool way to get around
cumbersome second phone lines and leaving machines on all night,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Market Vibes
</P>
<P>
   Users of the latest mobile gizmo will know that it's time to buy
or sell stocks when they feel vibrations in their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The device, called the Mobile Broker, is a pager configured to
permit users to buy and sell stocks, check portfolios and real-time
stock prices, and send and receive e-mail. The pager can also be
programmed to tell investors, either through a beep or vibrations,
when a desired buy or sell price has been received.
</P>
<P>
   The pager is made by BellSouth, but the $49-per-month stock
service is being offered by Siebert &AMP; Co., a small, independent
discount broker based in New York. Muriel Siebert, the company's
founder and chief executive, said that in addition to the monthly
fee, pager traders would pay a $29.95 fee per transaction. She said
that was a fair price for a service that lets an investor trade
stocks while driving or playing golf.
</P>
<P>
   But this idea may have its pitfalls for the rest of us. Imagine
being stuck behind a day trader toting a Mobile Broker on the
freeway as he or she tries to navigate a wildly fluctuating stock
market while driving at 75 miles an hour, using the free hand to
chat on the cellular phone.

   Digital Time Capsule
</P>
<P>
   Virtual reality claimed yet another vestige of the physical
world last week at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The
Sloan School of Management there sealed and launched a time
capsule, but the contents are all digital, the capsule merely
virtual and its destination not deep space, but cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   In the encrypted capsule, which is held on a server at MIT, are
symbols of life and business on the Internet, including audio files
of the impeachment proceedings, a sample of the Victoria's Secret
Web site, Amazon.com pages and snippets of Dilbert and South Park
cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   The capsule also contains predictions of what will transpire in
the next five years. The predictions come from accomplished MIT
graduates and also several celebrities, including Bill Gates and
Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the prognostications are to remain a secret until the
cybervault is opened in five years, although one Sloan official
offered a guess at Gates' vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's hoping his trial will be over by 2004,'' said Mary
Schaefer, the school's director of communication.
</P>
<P>
   Secretadmirer.com
</P>
<P>
   For this Valentine's Day, the Web offers no end of personal
advertisements and chat rooms to hook up total strangers. But one
site has found a way to find out if the object of a crush returns
the feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Secretadmirer.com allows a visitor to send an anonymous e-mail
to a person the sender has a crush on. The receiver is then
informed that he or she has a secret admirer and is given the
option of sending a note, also anonymous, to whomever he or she
might have a crush on.
</P>
<P>
   If the notes make a match, then the computer program informs
both parties. If there is no match after two weeks, the computer
sends the original sender a rejection note. Of course, the original
anonymous note might have inspired the receiver to send a note to
someone else, not the sender.
</P>
<P>
   ``One sender's note can start a chain reaction of crushes,''
said Miles Kronby, the founder of Secretadmirer.com.
</P>
<P>
   Kronby, a graduate of New York University's interactive
telecommunications program, devised the site after a co-worker told
him that she had a crush on a co-worker but was scared to approach
him. He encouraged her to tell the co-worker anyway, but when she
did, she got a very chilly response. ``After that, it made it
really uncomfortable for them to work with each other,'' he said.
``It got me thinking that there must be a better way to test the
waters.''
</P>
<P>
   Kronby said the free matchmaking service had been responsible
for more than 10,000 matches since it started in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Shafer Murray, an 18-year-old college freshman from Seattle,
said he had recently used the site to get in contact with a woman
he met at a party. To his relief, Secretadmirer.com alerted him
that they were a match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really shy, so it saved me from the nightmare of having to
talk to her in person,'' he said. ``I don't think we would have
gotten together otherwise.''

   Birds on the Net
</P>
<P>
   From the 19th to the 22nd of this month, bird watchers
nationwide can use the Internet to help the National Audubon
Society track the winter bird migration. The Audubon Society, along
with Cornell University, is seeking volunteers in the second annual
``back yard bird watch'' to report their daily sightings to the Web
at birdsource.cornell.edu.
</P>
<P>
   Taking birding information online will allow scientists to
digest and publish the daily sightings more quickly, said John
Bianchi, spokesman for National Audubon Society, based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``As results come in, we'll publish them on a map,'' he said of
the bird-watching updates. ``It will be just like election
returns.''

ROLLING STONES SQUEEZE MORE OUT OF LESS AT POND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Much has been made of the fact that the Rolling
Stones' current ``No Security'' tour is their first trek through
the relatively cozy confines of arenas in 20 years. But Tuesday
night at the Arrowhead Pond in Anaheim, it was the venerable band's
three-song set on a tiny stage in the middle of that cozy arena
that gave fans more than their fair share of satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   With a loose feel that gave the impression of a jam session, the
Stones tore through playful versions of ``Route 66'' and ``Just My
Imagination'' before delivering a thunderous ``Midnight Rambler''
that matched the definitive cut on their magnificent live album
``Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out.'' Scorching guitar work from Keith Richards
and Ron Wood pushed Mick Jagger to explore the song's dark
underbelly. It was the defining moment in a concert full of raw and
raucous rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   The Stones have scaled back their stadium theatrics for this
arena tour, giving the songs more immediacy and power. For one
thing, warhorses like ``Jumpin' Jack Flash'' and ``Honky Tonk
Woman'' were shorter and punchier because Jagger didn't have to run
around a stage the size of an aircraft carrier, trying to keep a
stadium full of people happy. Jagger has also given up wearing the
outlandish costumes, sticking instead to a series of tank tops and
tight jeans. He wore them well.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-year-old Jagger also gave a nod to his current marital
troubles with a set of songs that could easily have been called
``The Jerry Hall Suite.'' Starting with the classic ode to
misogyny, ``Some Girls,'' the band continued with ``Saint of Me''
(``You'll NEVER make a saint of me'') and a fantastic, stomping
``Paint It Black.'' It was impossible to miss the message.
</P>
<P>
   The band remains in excellent form, Jagger strutting and
contorting his body every which way and Richards striking the
classic guitar-god poses he trademarked. Wood still ably lays down
his lead guitar lines and drummer Charlie Watts holds the whole
thing together with his rock-solid beat.
</P>
<P>
   The show ended with one classic after another: ``Tumbling
Dice,'' ``It's Only Rock 'n' Roll (But I Like It),'' ``Start Me
Up,'' ``Brown Sugar'' and an encore of ``Sympathy For the Devil.''
We've all heard them a thousand times, but somehow the songs still
sound fresh and alive.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this could be the last time, but let's hope not. These
Stones are still rolling, gathering no moss along the way.

TV NEWS VETERAN PREFERS BEING BEHIND RADIO MICROPHONE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ All-news KFWB-AM's new co-anchor and reporter
Kathleen Sullivan might just have the brightest smile on the dial _
not that you'll see much of it.
</P>
<P>
   Emmy Award-winning Sullivan, who anchored the 1984 Winter
Olympic Games in Sarajevo and that year's Summer Olympics in Los
Angeles for ABC-TV, spent many years in television but actually
prefers her new home behind the radio microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to write and report, and TV doesn't lend itself to a
lot of interesting stories because of its constant demand for
visuals,'' Sullivan offers. ``I love the news, but the attention to
my hair color got a little exhausting. When that became more
important than the lead story, I said, `Please.' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena-bred Sullivan has worked at CNN, CBS and ABC in her
20-year career as a broadcast journalist. More recently, she
received Emmy nominations as host of E! Entertainment Television's
``E! News Daily,'' which she joined after anchoring the cable
channel's gavel-to-gavel coverage of the O.J. Simpson murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   Although she's already on the air at KFWB (980), Monday is the
official launch of the station's five-hour morning show, which also
features co-anchor Dan Avey and senior correspondent Bob Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kathleen brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the
KFWB news team,'' said program director Dave Cooke, adding that
listener reaction has been ``overwhelmingly positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan is no stranger to radio. She's done fill-in work at
talk station KABC-AM (790) in the morning and other times during
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always believed news can be written and presented in an
entertaining fashion,'' she said. ``So, if anything, you can expect
the presentation to be a little spunkier with some interesting
points of view.''

LIFE SPELLS OUT ITS LITTLE LESSONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My daughter Asha handed me another stack of graded papers
recently from a week of school, including a spelling test with two
parts.
</P>
<P>
   She received a 95 on the portion in which she had to spell the
words of the week and made one error and a 100 on the other
section, in which she had to use the words correctly in a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   What she wanted me to take special note of was that in both
parts of the test, she had misspelled the word paint as P-A-N-I-T
and that she had pointed this out to her second-grade teacher, Mrs.
Plummer. Because of Asha's honesty, she told me, Mrs. Plummer
allowed her to keep the grade of 100 on the sentence-formation
section.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasn't that nice?'' Asha asked me with a great big smile.
</P>
<P>
   I agreed that this was a nice gesture and made special note of
Asha's willingness to risk getting a lower grade by telling the
truth. Then I asked her for the correct spelling. ``P_A_I_N_T,''
she responded ever so slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good girl,'' I said, slapping her little hand in a high five.
</P>
<P>
   Asha skipped off to add the papers to the rest of the stack from
the year, and I was left thinking how often life offers us teaching
moments, moments to impart wisdom to others and//or learn from our
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they come from a loved one or a friend or one of life's
experiences, such moments happen to all of us _ but for one reason
or another, not all of us take advantage of them.
</P>
<P>
   As a parent, I sometimes get too busy to take time for such
moments with my girls. If I'm lucky enough to get home from work at
a reasonable hour, there's still dinner to be prepared and homework
to be checked in the three hours before my daughters' bedtime. And
teachers often don't see imparting morals as part of their jobs _
even if they did have the time, which, these days, is increasingly
rare.
</P>
<P>
   And so I was more than a little grateful for Mrs. Plummer and
proud of Asha. Because I know how important getting A's is to my
little girl, I'm aware that she could have kept silent. She didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes honesty is clear-cut. Other times, it's not so simple.
Despite our intentions, we often send children mixed messages.
Recently, for instance, I promised my daughter Jamila that I would
purchase her a telescope. When the next Saturday morning rolled
around, she wanted her telescope. Right then. But I had thought it
would make a good birthday present.
</P>
<P>
   So I had lied to her.
</P>
<P>
   Some people argue that school isn't the best place to teach
children character, and maybe it isn't. But it's comforting knowing
that my daughter's teacher took the time to spot opportunity in
that teaching moment.
</P>
<P>
   When teaching moments are clear-cut, we need to act as Mrs.
Plummer did. We also need to remember that kids learn from us even
when we're not teaching them _ and if we're not paying attention,
we might not be saying exactly what we mean.

ON A BROOKLYN MISSION TO BE A GOOD NEIGHBOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 14)  
(DW) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the best-kept secrets in the performing arts
in New York City is 651 Arts. The Brooklyn-based producing and
presenting organization is often confused with the Brooklyn Academy
of Music, a separate corporation that helped found it nearly 10
years ago and has maintained a symbiotic relationship with it. But
the work and mission of 651 Arts are very clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about connections: artist to audience, artist to
community, community to community, audience to audience, artist to
artist and organization to organization,'' Maurine D. Knighton,
executive director of 651, said in a recent interview. ``We're
always looking to do that in ways that are meaningful and positive
and move things forward for the people involved in the connecting.
Ultimately, everybody wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, 651 is a developer, producer and presenter of
contemporary performing-arts works by black artists like Donald
Byrd (``Harlem Nutcracker'' and ``Jazz Train''), Anna Deavere Smith
(``Fires in the Mirror'') and Randy Weston (a production of his
rarely performed 1961 ``Uhuru Afrika'').
</P>
<P>
   This month, 651 is one of 13 organizations citywide that is
participating in a salute to the documentary ``I'll Make Me a
World.''
</P>
<P>
   Events include a Sunday film series, ``Black Beyond Borders:
Mapping the African Diaspora,'' as well as ``Story Corner: African
American Stories'' on Feb. 27, both at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
Behind the scenes, 651 is also developing music projects with Nona
Hendrix, Sekou Sundiata and Craig Harris and a workshop in the
Katherine Dunham technique with the Philadanco dance troupe of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Money is being raised for ``Black Dance: Tradition and
Transformation,'' a project for next February that will present
performances and commission companies nationally to create and
reconstruct dances. And 651 has provided rehearsal space to the
choreographers Dianne McIntyre and Ron Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Housed in the city-owned Majestic Theater, which it leases
rent-free from the Academy, 651 takes its name from the address of
the Majestic, at 651 Fulton Street, two blocks from the Academy. It
was founded in 1988 with a mandate from New York City to provide
cultural programming of interest to neighboring communities, many
of whose populations are predominantly black.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be more responsive to the community in a smaller
house with some union breaks, so that it was financially possible
to do more than we were able to do at BAM,'' Harvey Lichtenstein,
the executive producer of the Academy, said.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein chose Mikki Shepard and Leonard Goines, arts
consultants who had produced large-scale black dance and music
events at the Academy, to shape and direct 651. In the first few
years, 651 got administrative help and $100,000 a year from the
Academy. It now contributes $60,000 annually to the center's
budget, which is $1.6 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   The organization started as a traditional presenter. ``We were
not trying to shape something for a specific audience,'' said Ms.
Shepard, who left 651 in September to become director of arts and
humanities at the Rockefeller Foundation. ``We wanted to know what
was important to them. And over time, things began to emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Artist Residency Program and Neighborhood Arts
Network were added and soon became as important as the
performances. The Artist Residency Program sends artists out into
the community to teach, create and perform. Africa Exchange,
supported by the Ford Foundation, brings African artists to the
United States to work with Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Neighborhood Arts Network links 651 and its artists with
arts organizations in eight Brooklyn neighborhoods.The five core
constituents are El Puente de Williamsburg, a public high school
and community center; the Gowanus Arts Exchange, an organization in
Park Slope that offers classes in the arts and presents dance,
music and theater performances; the Ifetayo Cultural Arts Facility,
a community arts center in Flatbush; Medgar Evers Community College
in Crown Heights, and the Fort Greene Senior Center. In addition,
651 develops and presents events with other arts organizations
around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the core organizations had a track record in its
community. ``Mikki Shepard's vision was not to reinvent the wheel
but help community organizations to become stronger and more what
they were,'' Sister Kwayera D. Cunningham, the executive director
of Ifetayo, said. ``It was not `This is what we want you to do' but
`What do you need?' We needed technical assistance in various
areas. They provided us with a development consultant. They never
wavered.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ifetayo Youth Ensemble has a repertory that includes pieces
created for the teen-age dance troupe by three 651 artists, Byrd,
Kevin Jeff and Abdel Salaam. Family members and adults studying at
the center have come to know more about the arts through that work.
Parents approach Sister Kwayera, as she is known to all, and say:
``Oh, 651 is doing this. Do you have tickets?''
</P>
<P>
   Marya Warshaw, executive director of Gowanus, describes it as
``a developmental home'' for artists as well as a presenting
organization. Gowanus, which has the largest white constituency of
the network groups, has acted as co-producer with 651 and received
help with fund-raising, marketing and in-kind services. Other help
included vouchers for tickets from backers of 651 and master
classes taught by 651 artists.
</P>
<P>
   All 651 constituents are considered to be interlocking
communities, whether neighborhoods, audiences, artists or
contributors. The Ifetayo ensemble is working on a new piece with
Salaam, to be performed in April at the Medgar Evers theater, and
the choreographer has also acquired a badly needed booking agent
through 651.
</P>
<P>
   Another example is the ``Dance and Spiritual Life'' program in
November, one aim of which was to provide audiences with an unusual
and thought-provoking way to look at dance by three familiar female
choreographers: Dianne McIntyre, Bebe Miller and Jawole Willa Jo
Zollar, founder of Urban Bush Women. The Cornerstone Baptist Church
in Bedford-Stuyvesant came to know 651 through an event in 1997.
Dancers spent a day at the church teaching the 72 children in the
day care center, working with the Praise Dancers, a troupe of
teen-agers interested in the relationship between the body and the
spirit, and sharing a meal with both groups. ``We were so
impressed,'' said the Rev. Harry S. Wright, Senior Pastor of the
church. ``And so, a year later, the partnership continued in a
deeper way.''
</P>
<P>
   The church was chosen to hold a panel discussion on the
involvement of the black church in dance in connection with ``Dance
and Spiritual Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine a more conservative setting to talk about
dance and spirituality,'' Wright said. ``I wanted to have this
panel of experts come out, particularly with a black dance
historian and real live professional dancers who were also members
of other churches. It worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've found real friends in 651. And they have also
sensed a tremendous hunger and appetite in our neighborhood for
arts and humanities appreciation.''

GRAMMY NOD REGISTERS HIGH NOTE FOR ALTO SAX PLAYER
</HEADLINE>

   LOS ANGELES_ Latin-American alto saxophonist Paquito D'Rivera
doesn't make music to win awards, but he admits his recent Grammy
nod just plain feels good.
</P>
<P>
   D'Rivera is up for best Latin jazz performance for the album
``Live at Manchester Craftsmen's Guild'' (Blue Jackel), cut in 1997
with his United Nation Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Havana in 1948, D'Rivera was introduced to jazz by his
father and heard the music of his earliest influences _ Benny
Goodman, Charlie Parker and Paul Desmond _ on Voice of America
broadcasts. He defected to the United States in 1980 while on a
tour of Europe and moved to New York, where he began playing with
Dizzy Gillespie and McCoy Tyner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worked for awards,'' D'Rivera said. ``But when
people recognize the fruit of your work, it's nice. The award has
really been the pleasure of being in this business for so many
years. But it's nice to be recognized by the record academy. So
many wonderful artists never get any awards at all, while so many
terrible artists get awards who shouldn't be allowed to perform in
public. In many cases, though, they do award the right people.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Rivera won a Grammy in 1996 for best Latin jazz performance
for his musical salute to his homeland, ``Portraits of Cuba''
(Chesky). A new album, ``Paquito D'Rivera With Strings: 100 Years
of Latin Love Songs'' (Heads Up), was issued recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a group of people recognize my work, I'm very thankful,''
the saxophonist said Tuesday. ``It's better to have it than not.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Rivera, working on a jazz piece for the New Jersey Chamber
Music Society, boasts a strict work ethic. He usually cuts an album
a year while touring and composing music at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a studio person, I'm more a performer,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The 41st annual Grammy Awards will be announced Feb. 24 at a
televised ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ That Charles Schulz doesn't rate an entry in the
Oxford Companion to American Literature can only be explained as
some ghastly oversight on the part of the editors. It is true that
Schulz is known primarily as a cartoonist. Yet he not only writes
his own scripts for ``Peanuts,'' which first appeared in 1950; he
also letters his own dialogue in the balloons that float over his
characters' heads. Not even John Cheever, John Updike or any of the
other esteemed chroniclers of life in the American suburbs and
exurbs after World War II could make such a claim. What, after all,
do we mean when we speak of ``a man of letters?''
</P>
<P>
   Ponder that.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, if you're looking for a gentle, wise, very
cheering entertainment, you couldn't do better than to visit the
Ambassador Theater to see the almost-new, pocket-size musical
``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.'' This is Michael Mayer's
revival of the 1967 Off Broadway hit, based on the ``Peanuts''
comic strip, for which Clark Gesner wrote the music, book and
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, you will discover a blissfully sunny
alternate universe to the one of broken marriages, career
compromises, alcoholism, mental breakdowns (plus the occasional
redemption) that became so familiar in American literature of the
postwar years.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to suggest for a minute that Schulz had any such
ideas in mind when he created the born-to-lose Charlie Brown and
the other members of the ``Peanuts'' gang. They remain forever
young in Schulz's static universe, where no one seems to be older
than 10 and where the most poetic mind among them is possessed by a
beagle named Snoopy.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape around them is generic and two-dimensional: a tree
is a tree, a cloud a cloud, a doghouse a doghouse. Yet Schulz's
characters are so accurately and eccentrically realized, you
suspect that if they ever grew up, they would be much like
Cheever's, getting into boozy Saturday night scrapes in a town with
a name like Shady Hill. Charlie Brown and his friends may be
children, but they wear their neuroses with pride.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Lucy, a crabby child only too happy to tell someone the
blunt, embarrassing truth, who is madly in love with the
piano-playing Schroeder and serenely unaware that, for him, she
doesn't exist. The adult Lucy will be the last to know her husband
is sleeping with every woman in the neighborhood except her.
Schroeder will leave home hoping for a career as a concert artist,
but he will wind up playing the organ in any church that will have
him. Then there is Linus, who walks around clutching his beloved
blanket, an embryonic fetishist's festishist if there ever was one.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Brown's little sister, Sally (who replaces the character
of Patty in Mayer's revival of the show), is all Shirley Temple
corkscrew curls and simpering grins. But as played by the
spectacularly funny Kristin Chenoweth, she has a voice that is
sharp enough to etch monograms into Baccarat crystal. She will be
Shady Hill's most successful fundraiser, at least in part because
people will pay her to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   Dear sweet clumsy Charlie Brown? He will drop out of college,
run a hardware store, coach a second-rate Little League team and,
in his middle years, start to (lower your voice so the children
can't hear) d-r-i-n-k. The most humane, least neurotic of the gang
is Snoopy, and he will be long gone by the time his old pals fall
apart.
</P>
<P>
   These fantasies are not meant to belittle Schulz's classic
strip, but to explain its long-term appeal. His accomplishment has
been to create children who are recognizable both as children and
as the adults they will become. They are not exactly the kids next
door. They live in a reality that is singular to the Schulz strip.
</P>
<P>
   It is this quality that makes Mayer's ``You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown'' such an endearing endeavor, a series of sketches
intended to represent an average day in the life of Charlie Brown.
In most cases the members of the cast, never attempt to deny the
evidence of their actual ages. Instead, they play their roles
straight, that is, from the inside out, without resorting to
all-purpose kiddie mannerisms.
</P>
<P>
   The results are astonishing in several cases. Ms. Chenoweth's
Sally is both a kid you might want to swat if you had to live with
her, and a personality who tomorrow could play Miss Adelaide in
``Guys and Dolls.'' She is magical on stage. So, too, is B.D. Wong,
who made his Broadway debut in ``M. Butterfly'' in 1988. Now in his
later 30s, he appears to be having the time of his life giving a
priceless performance as the thumb-sucking, blanket-clutching,
singing and dancing Linus. Not for a minute does he disguise the
man he is but, in him, Linus lives. How does he do it? I haven't a
clue. That's theater.
</P>
<P>
   Ilana Levine, whose grating voice is also a superb musical
comedy weapon, is enchanting as the furrow-browed Lucy, as when she
instructs Linus to study Charlie Brown's ``Failure Face.'' ``Notice
the deep lines,'' she says with nasty pleasure, ``the dull, vacant
look in the eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing the show's star beagle is Roger Bart, a marvelous clown
whose manic energy and facial expressions are reminiscent of Ronnie
Graham's. He is an explosively comic joy as Snoopy, whether doing
imaginary battle with the Red Baron in the skies over France,
lolling in the sun atop his doghouse or anticipating the delights
of his evening meal.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Wayne Mathis is as lively as his meager material allows
in the role of Schroeder, while Anthony Rapp, a good actor you may
remember as the camcorder operator in ``Rent,'' appears to be
bewildered as Charlie Brown. The role is not especially rewarding,
I suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Brown is a passive figure. He is diffident, lonely,
apologetic, not easily brought to active life by someone who does
not yet have his own idiosyncratic stage presence, such as a young
Robert Morse. Rapp's way is sometimes to play down to Charlie
Brown, as in his taking small, childlike steps, and at other times
to play him as a more or less conventional musical comedy juvenile
in the middle of what is otherwise a cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Lippa, the show's musical supervisor and arranger, has
written new material for some of the Gesner songs and two new
numbers of his own. The one you will remember: ``My New
Philosophy,'' in which Sally realizes that she can respond to
almost any statement by saying ``That's what you think,'' and
Schroeder decides that his comeback will be, ``Why are you telling
me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' is small in scale, simply
but effectively set in a cartoon world, and demands a certain
knowledge of and affection for Schulz's work. Mayer, whose last
major Broadway hit was the powerhouse revival of Arthur Miller's
``View From the Bridge,'' is clearly a man who likes to test his
range.
</P>

   ``Blue Heart'' is the collective title for the program of two
hilarious and mysterious Caryl Churchill plays that will be ending
their 24-performance run at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's
Majestic Theater next Sunday. My advice: run, don't walk, to
Brooklyn or, if you live in Manhattan, take the BAM Bus. Otherwise
you will miss one of the wittiest, most gorgeously performed
theatrical events since last year's Broadway engagement of the
London revival of the Ionesco classic, ``The Chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chairs'' does not come to mind by chance. Ms. Churchill,
who writes in all sorts of veins, from the documentary (``Mad
Forest'') to the metaphysical (``The Skriker''), is here entering
territory that, superficially anyway, looks a lot like Ionesco's
absurdist theater at its most bracing.
</P>
<P>
   The first play, ``Heart's Desire,'' also recalls the blithe
surrealism of Luis Bunuel's ``Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie.''
A lower-middle-class Mum, Dad and Auntie sit in the kitchen of
their London council house awaiting the arrival of their daughter,
who is coming home from Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the play can never quite get going: it keeps changing its
mind. Mum and Dad's bickering is interrupted by a call that there
has been a terrible accident, at which point the play starts again.
Each time it begins, something else interrupts things, forcing the
actors to start over once more. We learn a body has been found in
the garden. At another point, two gunmen show up. Later, a huge
ostrich ambles on.
</P>
<P>
   As the absurdities accumulate and the familiar opening scene is
played for the umpteenth time, the pace becomes increasingly
frantic. Is it the playwright who can't make up her mind? Is this a
meditation on life lived not in the present but entirely in
expectation, often in dread? The answers are unimportant. For some
reason, seeing theatrical reality turned on its ear in this giddy
fashion is a kind of liberation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Kettle,'' the second play, features a genially shabby man
in his early 40's who has a scam: he collects mothers, each a woman
to whom he announces himself as the baby she put up for adoption
years before. He is not sure what his motive is, though he thinks
there may be money in it.
</P>
<P>
   As his conquests go on, something very strange happens: language
begins to lose its meaning. The words ``blue'' and ``kettle'' turn
up with increasing frequency as substitutes for words in otherwise
coherent sentences. Eventually, ``blue'' and ``kettle,'' the only
words left, disintegrate into their isolated letters that, in their
turn, vanish, leaving only a ``b'' and ``k.'' Yet no one seems to
notice; life goes on with its usual mindless self-absorption. The
play's ending, though spoken in gibberish, is utterly clear and
heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   Max Stafford-Clark is the wizardly director of the program,
which is a production of Out of Joint, the London-based touring
company founded in 1993 by Stafford-Clark and Sonia Friedman. The
production at the Majestic is the one that played at the Royal
Court in London in 1997 with many of the same superb actors.
Everything about the performance is immaculate. The writing
dazzles.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Pinter's ``Ashes to Ashes,'' the Roundabout Theater
Company production now Off Broadway at the Gramercy Theater, is
less a play than a formless reverie. Here is a brief (40-minute)
duologue that considers (with a good deal of self-importance) what
it is like to be civilized and physically unscathed in, say, an
English university town, while being aware of the unspeakable
atrocities committed every hour of the day elsewhere in the world.
They seep into our collective unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Pinter seems to be saying that we pay a terrible price. Our
dreams are turned into nightmares. We feel guilt. Even healthy,
robust sex loses its rosy glow. If this is another way of
suggesting that we are all victims, we must learn to pity the rich,
the secure and the overfed.
</P>
<P>
   The setting looks to be the study in the house of a professor,
though the two characters are not identified beyond their names.
When the lights come up, Devlin (David Strathairn) stands, a drink
in his hand, listening to a seemingly transfixed Rebecca (Lindsay
Duncan).
</P>
<P>
   Staring straight ahead from her easy chair, she meticulously
describes something that seems to have been a bit of the old S&AMP;M
with an earlier lover. Devlin, who could be her husband, her
psychiatrist, her lover, or maybe all three, has not heard the
story before. He is anxious.
</P>
<P>
   They are having trouble making connections, possibly because
Pinter's dialogue keeps sliding back on itself, like a car with
slipping gears trying to go up a steep hill. ``What did you say,''
says Devlin. ``You said? What did you say?''
</P>
<P>
   As the evening wears on, she remembers events that could be
dreams inspired by newsreels of the Holocaust, television reports
on the war in Bosnia, memoirs about the ``disappeared ones'' in
Pinochet's Chile, a scene from William Styron's ``Sophie's
Choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ashes to Ashes'' ends as it begins, in silence.
</P>
<P>
   A clue as to what Pinter is doing here can be found in an
interview he gave in Barcelona in 1996, published in a recent Grove
Press collection of Pinter pieces titled ``Various Voices.'' In
that interview the playwright congratulates the Barcelona audiences
for being more receptive to ``Ashes to Ashes'' than London
audiences. ``In Britain,'' he says, with the authority of someone
who has abandoned all self-doubt, ``there is no tradition of
artists being respected.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinter himself directed the play when it was done at the
Ambassadors Theater in London three years ago with Ms. Duncan and
Stephen Rea. Karel Reisz is the director of the New York
production, which appears to be almost everything a play-proud
dramatist could desire. Ms. Duncan is firm, intense and centered as
the grieving Rebecca, and though Strathairn's accent is uneasy, his
presence is secure.
</P>
<P>
   The piece has moments of haunting eloquence. Too often, though,
it sounds like self-parody from a master who has no awareness he is
producing hot air. These are not 40 minutes to leave home for.
</P>

   Peace Lily
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a lovely plant which I was told is called peace lily.
It has large, graceful leaves, and often a long stem grows from it
with a graceful half lily. The problem is that the leaves get brown
at the tips and gradually the leaf rots, and I then have to cut it
off. What am I doing wrong? I always keep the plant moist.
</P>
<P>
   A. Given a regular supply of water, peace lily (Spathiphyllum)
can adjust to just about any indoor conditions. Consequently, large
and small, the lilies are found everywhere: hotel lobbies, mall
atriums, airport waiting rooms. And there they sit, quietly green,
occasionally producing a slender stalk with a single white bract _
a simple sail. With indoor plants, the harder they are to kill, the
more popular they are.
</P>
<P>
   The browning tips are a sign of excessive buildup of salts in
the potting medium, said Dr. Richard Henley, a specialist in
foliage plants and a professor of environmental horticulture at the
University of Florida's Research and Education Center in Apopka.
What we call low light plants may tolerate low light levels, but
they don't necessarily thrive, and don't need as much fertilizer as
they would in higher light. Minerals in the fertilizer are not
being taken up rapidly enough because spathiphyllum is not a heavy
feeder to begin with, and needs even less in low light conditions.
Flushing the pot with at least a half gallon of water two or three
times should remove the mineral salts. Wait an hour between
flushings. In the future, fertilize at about half the rate
recommended on the label, or less.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, peace lilies are bought bearing the only bloom their
owners will ever see. To rebloom, they usually need about two weeks
during the winter when the night temperatures are about 50 degrees.
In addition, they need enough light. While they will survive just
fine in light that is bright enough for you to read by, they should
have about twice as much if they are to flower. Tolerating low
light is one thing. Being happy in it is another.
</P>
<P>
   Please, No More Help
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the spring of 1995, I had a nursery plant a 12-foot
Katsura tree on my lawn in Columbia County, N.Y. I have fertilized
it as recommended and watered it as much as possible. Last spring I
noticed that the bark appeared to be splitting. The nursery didn't
have an answer, and it suggested wrapping the trunk with a
lightweight paper wrap. Subsequently, a tree pruner advised
removing the wrap because of potential insect or fungus problems.
The splitting, however, now affects about 30 percent of the bark
coming down one side. Someone suggested the trunk may have been
struck by lightning, and another suggested that deer may have been
chewing at the bark.
</P>
<P>
   This summer I added a wire mesh around the trunk to negate the
deer problem. A friend also pruned the tree so that the reduced
strength of the trunk would have to serve fewer limbs on top.
</P>
<P>
   Can you tell me what I should be doing to try to save this tree?
I fear it may be dying.
</P>
<P>
   A. I am a little surprised, and more than a little disappointed,
that of all the people you talked with about your Katsura tree
(Cercidiphyllum japonicum), none realized that a certain air of
genteel shagginess from the peeling bark is not only normal as the
tree ages, but usually considered desirable. Only the arborist who
advised removing the wrap gets a little credit for being right.
Consider yourself lucky that no one suggested a chain saw as a way
of preventing this so-called problem from spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case a walk around the neighborhood should uncover other
trees with exfoliating bark (peeling, flaking, splitting, loose or
falling off in big plates), please identify them and look them up
at the library before taking action. You may find a shagbark
hickory, which, compared with your Katsura, will look positively
disastrous. Others include kousa dogwood (rounded, irregular flakes
of gray, tan and brown), cornelian cherry dogwood (muted grey and
tan pieces flake right off), parrotia (the bark peels off in gray,
green and tan pieces) and sycamores and London planes (large plates
come loose and drop off). In most cases, the bark on younger trees
is smooth, and the exfoliation occurs as they get older. Unlike
people, trees are proud to show their age.
</P>
<P>
   Insomniac Plants
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do plants need a period each day without light? I'm in a 36th
floor office in downtown Manhattan with a view uptown. I get
abundant light, but virtually no direct sun. In addition I have
several fluorescent ceiling lights on all day. My snake plants and
Boston ferns are doing well. Last winter, I kept the office lights
on at night, so the plants had natural and artificial light during
the day and artificial light at night. They seemed to do well, but
do they need a period of darkness?
</P>
<P>
   A. Those 24-hour days aren't doing them any harm because plants
don't need to sleep, but the added benefit of the extra hours of
light is minimal, so why not turn the lights off when you go home?
It sounds as if you have north light, nice and even but without
direct sun _ perfect for painters or low-light foliage plants.
</P>
<P>
   You won't see any noticeable change in growth _ the level of
light from ceiling fluorescent fixtures is not nearly as important
to the plants as the window light.
</P>
<P>
   But there are times in some plants' lives when it does make a
difference. Christmas cactus, poinsettia and chrysanthemum need
specific periods of darkness to start flowering. Flowering
initiates the reproductive process, so maybe some plants are as
Puritan as some people.

<P>
   Twenty years ago, when young Mike Kittredge was following the
American Dream and building his Yankee Candle business, one of his
personal indulgences was a neat car or two.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 was a 1970 Jaguar, bought in 1972 with the first of his
hard-earned candlemaking profits. Fortunately (in retrospect), that
Jag cost him so much to repair that he sold it and used the
proceeds to resume his candlemaking business.
</P>
<P>
   But cars remained a key component of his operation.
</P>
<P>
   As Yankee Candle grew, many times Kittredge would be leaving the
building only to find a cluster of folks around his car, talking
about (no surprise) cars.
</P>
<P>
   These folks were the shopped-out companions of Yankee Candle
patrons. Mostly, but not always, they were males.
</P>
<P>
   They had come along for the shopping, but ran out of gas (so to
speak) before their companions were finished and stepped outside
only to find a special interest car.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yankee Candle, being a good corporate neighbor, also
started hosting an annual antique- and special-interest-car show to
benefit Mothers Against Drunk Driving. The shows were a huge hit,
bringing in big crowds and making some serious money for the
charity.
</P>
<P>
   But they also made a lot of money for Yankee Candle, too. On
auto show days, the daily receipts were up appreciably.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mr. Kittredge didn't build a company that was sold for a
reported $400 million last April by ingnoring details like this.
</P>
<P>
   So he opened a small auto museum across the street from the main
Yankee Candle operation on Route 5. He put some of his own cars on
display and also exhibited other folks' cars as well.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he expanded the main retail building to include a
separate museum (we told you this is a big place) capable of
displaying 85-90 cars. ``The kind of cars that make you go WOW!''
is how YC describes its ever-changing display. An example: A 1977
Volkswagen Beetle with 150 original miles that was bought from
Jerry Seinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cars belong to the museum, some belong to Kittredge,
and many are on loan from individuals. How do these latter cars
wind up in a museum?
</P>
<P>
   That's where museum employees such as historian John Schieffelin
come in.
</P>
<P>
   He's constantly overseeing the collection and schmoozing with
visitors, many of whom surprise him with their revelations of rare
or restored cars, trucks, and motorcycles in their possession and
in need of a safe place to be stored and displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Example: Ken Burian of Hampden, Mass., was visiting the museum
and mentioned to Schieffelin that he had a rebuilt 1948 Indian
Scout racing motorcycle sitting in his grandmother's cellar. The
two got talking, and now the motorcycle is on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people call to offer cars,'' said Schieffelin. ``Some
are just looking for winter storage, but our goal is to find cars
that fit in our displays.'' When the two goals agree, a vehicle
goes on display.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's exhibits fit various loose categories, generally
displayed in rows. There's a row of early 1900 steam, electric, and
gas vehicles; an oddball row, featuring the Seinfeld VW, a
Metropolitan, Isetta, Citroen, Amphicar, and Messerschmitt; a
tremendous collection of eight Ferraris scattered throughout the
room; a row of American Muscle cars; a row of NASCAR and other
American race cars; a row of European sports car racers and much
more.
</P>
<P>
   One current favorite is a 1912 Renault Brewster Landaulette. You
might not recognize the name, but one was in the hold of the
Titanic and now rests at the bottom of the North Atlantic. And a
similar one was used in the movie for a love scene with Leonardo
DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the ``Do not touch'' signs are out on 85 of the 87
cars on display.
</P>
<P>
   But not on two of the cars.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has a 1982 Ferrari 308 GTsi and a 1961 Rolls-Royce
Silver Cloud II on the floor as ``photo op'' cars. Visitors can
climb in and have their pictures taken _ as long as they remembered
a camera.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if they didn't, one-time-use cameras are for sale.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Mike Kittredge didn't build a company that was sold
for a reported $400 million last April by ignoring details like
this.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(Museum admission is $5 for adults, $2 for children under 11;
children under 4 are free.)

`BE COOL': CHILI PALMER'S LATEST MOVIE IDEA
</HEADLINE>
 (Editors: Publication notes at end of review) 
 (DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the way through Elmore Leonard's thoroughly
entertaining new novel, ``Be Cool,'' a police detective says to
Chili Palmer, the protagonist: ``My wife wants to know how come I'm
putting in so much overtime lately. I told her 'cause Chili
Palmer's making a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers will recognize Chili Palmer as the small-time Brooklyn
crook turned Hollywood movie producer who appeared in Leonard's
novel ``Get Shorty,'' made into the film starring John Travolta as
Chili. That story established how Chili's way of developing a film
script was to create a situation in actuality and then see what
happens. ``I start with different characters and see where they
take me,'' he explains in ``Be Cool.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Chili says about one possible film idea: ``It's believable
because it happened. It's real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this contradicts what Chekhov discovered when he
tried putting a real peasant onstage and found that he looked
unreal. But the method seems to work for Chili. He has made a
successful film called ``Get Leo,'' featuring an undersize loan
shark, as well as a sequel, ``Get Lost,'' whose failure he blames
on the studio's stupidity. Now, at the opening of ``Be Cool,'' he
thinks he has found another character with potential.
</P>
<P>
   She's a girl who works for one of those dating services, Chili
tells his lunch companion, Tommy Athens, an old buddy from Brooklyn
who has made it big in the recording business. ``This one I talked
to, soon as I heard her voice and the beginning of the pitch? I
thought, This could give me an idea. So I put her on tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy counters, ``I called you 'cause I got an idea for a
movie.'' ``Can you pitch it in 25 words or less?'' Chili asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell it in one word,'' Tommy says. ``Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Chili excuses himself to go to the bathroom. On the way there he
toys with the idea of combining Tommy's story with that of the
dating service girl, Linda Moon, whose ``real life'' is singing
with a rock band. As he returns to the table he sees a black car
pull up. Out of it steps a short guy with a gun who starts shooting
at Tommy and kills him with a bullet to the head.
</P>
<P>
   When the police come, Chili keeps ``his mouth shut looking at
the scene again, starting to rewrite it in his mind, the guy
playing Tommy no longer the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't have the star get popped 10 minutes into the
picture,'' he thinks. ``No, but it could be the way to open it. A
movie about the music business.''
</P>
<P>
   What's impressive about ``Be Cool'' is the number of plot
complications Leonard juggles so wittily. Linda Moon is stuck with
a manager she detests who calls himself Raji. (``Raji coming with
his slouch strut, his shades, his black Kangol cap on backwards the
way his hero Samuel L. Jackson wore his.'')
</P>
<P>
   Raji intimidates people because he keeps a bodyguard who is
``built like one of those giant Samoans you saw, this one going at
least 260 in his tank top, a do-rag down on his eyebrows, thick
black hair to his huge shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   He goes by the name Elliot Wilhelm (``What he doesn't look like
is an Elliot,'' Chili remarks), and his special skill is throwing
people out the windows of upper stories. But Chili knows that
Elliot dreams of making it ``as a star of stage and screen,'' as he
puts it. Eventually Chili's very life will depend on Elliot's
believing his promise of a screen test.
</P>
<P>
   Other plot wrinkles involve a very inside knowledge of the music
industry. Leonard seems to have mastered it. His characters
certainly talk the talk: ``I got an artist I just signed and I'm
ready to break, Derek Stones, with Roadkill,'' Tommy tells Chili at
their fateful lunch. ``It use to be a hair band, now they do
post-metal funk with a ska kick. You have any idea what I'm talking
about?''
</P>
<P>
   No, this reader didn't, but the wonder is, you get enough of the
drift not to feel too left behind. In many of the scenes where
music is performed, you can even imagine the sound.
</P>
<P>
   The nagging question remains, Why do you keep rooting for Chili
so completely?
</P>
<P>
   After all, back in Bay Ridge he used to sell goods ``that fell
off the back of trucks,'' and later, in Miami, he was ``you might
say, a loan shark,'' even if he does take the unusual position that
``there may be a certain amount of satisfaction in breaking a guy's
leg that gets behind, but how does he repay the loan if he's laid
up?''
</P>
<P>
   He's attractive because he's so smart and quietly sure of
himself that throughout ``Be Cool,'' despite the brutal world in
which he operates, he doesn't have to commit a single act of
violence. Certainly the women in the story like him, yet in
contrast to the studs of Leonard's early fiction, Chili is
considerate, even sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   When he spends the night with an old friend and she asks him if
he had ``a nice time,'' he tells her ``he had a wonderful time,
terrific, and that he felt _ it was funny, but he felt that being
good friends first and then going to bed . . . Elaine stopped him,
saying `Don't strain yourself, Chil. Listen, ``wonderful'' and
``terrific'' are fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, wonderful and terrific is what I'll say about ``Be
Cool.'' Leave it at that.

 &HT;    BURTON COMMITTEE TURNS ATTACK TO 'ALARMING' WASTE
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A congressional panel that spent the last two years
probing White House scandals refocused its attack Wednesday on
waste and fraud that it says drain billions of taxpayer dollars in
executive agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had controversy,'' Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., told his
House Government Reform Committee, of the tumultuous investigations
of President Clinton during the past congressional term.
</P>
<P>
   Burton pledged a bipartisan campaign to bring more efficiency to
the federal bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long way to go before the American people get their
money's worth from the federal government,'' he said as he pointed
out three of the most waste-prone federal departments that, he
said, ``paint an alarming picture of the state of affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those chief problems:
</P>
<P>
   The Housing and Urban Development department remains a
``management basket case,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   That view was largely endorsed by the department's inspector
general, Susan Gaffney, who told the panel that she opposes
Clinton's budget proposals for some 18 new programs added to the
350 now run by the Housing Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any sense to me,'' Gaffney said. ``HUD is
struggling. I don't understand why we want to make that struggle
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   She said a recent audit of ``Empowerment Zones'' in Atlanta,
Chicago, Detroit and Philadelphia showed there was no federal
oversight of the program, which gives federal assistance to
selected high-poverty areas. ``Now we are having designated another
15 empowerment zones,'' she said of expansions ordered late last
year for that program by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   HUD's deputy general counsel Howard B. Glaser, objecting to some
of Gaffney's descriptions, said in an interview that the department
had already reformed itself. But Gaffney said that ``no one knows
if it's going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare dramatically reduced improper payments for
fee-for-service from $20 billion in 1997, but it still paid $12.6
billion for improper billings in 1998, reported June Gibbs Brown,
inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   In a report issued Tuesday, Brown credited a government
crackdown plus more cooperation from hospitals for reducing the
problem in the fee-for-service billings. ``Nevertheless, we still
have a long way to go,'' she told the House committee.
</P>
<P>
   Burton called the trend ``encouraging'' but said the level of
problem payments was ``still unacceptable'' and totalled enough to
buy a personal computer for every third- and fourth-grader in
America.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture holds $12 billion in
delinquent debt from mortgages in a lending system that is rife
with conflicts-of-interest, said that department's inspector
general Roger C. Viadero. He acknowledged that, in some cases, loan
recipients help decide who receives the loans.
</P>
<P>
   Food stamp fraud is also a top problem, Viadero said. New
electronic debit cards, now being phased in, are more difficult to
misuse than paper food stamps, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Viadero told Burton that the debit cards don't track
purchases to verify whether recipients are buying beer, cigarettes
or other ineligible items.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, how much money do we want to put into it?''
the inspector general said of the electronic system. He said that
with the new card system, his investigators found $12 million in
food stamp fraud in five New Jersey counties over five months.

 Some legislators' reaction to attack on food tax was rotten  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reports of the demise of Kansas Rep. Cliff Franklin's popularity
may be as exaggerated as those of Mark Twain's death more than a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
   After the Merriam Republican last week led an effort resulting
in a House vote approving elimination of the Kansas sales tax on
food, the buzz in Topeka was that Franklin's brash move had made
him unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   What the buzzsters overlooked, however, was that unhappiness
with Franklin wasn't all that widespread. It certainly didn't
include the 86 House members responsible for a 70 percent
bipartisan majority voting in favor of the bill that carried
Franklin's controversial amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Those with whom Franklin had become unpopular, however, weren't
bashful about expressing their displeasure. One colleague called
him clumsy. Another reportedly stopped speaking to Franklin. The
House speaker called Franklin's action ``the poorest display of
statesmanship I've ever seen.'' The words ``irresponsible'' and
``affront'' were also heard.
</P>
<P>
   The worst censure, it's worth noting, came from the
Legislature's leadership. Since they can make life hard for
Franklin, this gives his stand a heroic quality.
</P>
<P>
   All of which Franklin greeted stoically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I'd get myself in a little trouble, (but) some issues
are worth taking arrows for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What terrible act did Franklin commit to deserve such opprobrium
from some of the Legislature's most powerful movers and shakers?
</P>
<P>
   He stood up for the best interests of those who elected him to
office.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, like most anyone able to tell the difference between
right and wrong, knows it's wrong for government to enrich itself
from the sale of the food needed to sustain human life. What
distinguishes Franklin is that he's a politician conscientious
enough to act on this awareness. As a result, he has crusaded for
some time against the Kansas sales tax on groceries.
</P>
<P>
   He and legislators of a like mind haven't prevailed because the
tax generates well over 200 million bucks a year in revenue. If
Kansas political leaders did the right thing and ended the grocery
tax, they'd feel obligated to rearrange things in a way that didn't
``cost'' the state money. The process of keeping things ``revenue
neutral'' might discombobulate some special interests apparently
considered more worthy of consideration than all the Kansans who
buy groceries on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Those angry at Franklin are upset because he violated protocol
by forcing a potentially embarrassing tax issue into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   How do we know his detractors care more about their own agendas
than they care about Kansans for whom the food tax is an
abomination? We know this because when they criticize Franklin,
they don't address his proposal's merits. Small wonder. Who, after
all, would be foolish enough to attempt to defend the indefensible?
</P>
<P>
   Thus frustrated, they try to deflect attention from the
righteousness of Franklin's cause by focusing on how he put them in
an uncomfortable spot politically.
</P>
<P>
   For the establishment protectors of the status quo, Franklin's
initiative is like a dead cat someone threw on their doorstep.
There's simply no way to get rid of it without the chore becoming
an unpleasant bit of business.

CLINTON-TAPES (Washington) - A disclosure that a U.S. intelligence
agency may have taped White House telephone conversations was not
intended by Republican senators to influence the impeachment trial
of the president, Sen. Jon Kyl said Wednesday. ``It has zero impact
on the impeachment. It simply is sent it down to OIC (Kenneth
Starr's office), and the impeachment trial goes down. We're going
to have a vote on Friday. It's not going to slow it down. If we had
wanted to do that, we would have sought to bring everything to a
screeching halt until we verified the information one way or
another. It was kept very quiet until it got out and there was no
effort by our leadership to insert it into the impeachment
process.'' Meanwhile, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said he
was not aware of any recordings or transcripts that resulted from
an outside agency monitoring the president's calls. By JEFF BARKER.

America West Airlines will be sold and leave town. The mayor

   Two units at a time, in unmarked vans and limousines, the cargo
was transported to the Performing Arts Center at Purchase College
in Purchase, N.Y. Heavily insured, the cargo consisted of 30 of the

Matt Wolf has written frequently for Arts and Leisure from London,
most recently about the playwright Caryl Churchill. 
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Could every one of you stop getting shot?'' a
particularly hapless character asks well into ``Lock, Stock and Two
Smoking Barrels,'' a cheeky London gangland film that opens on
March 5.
</P>
<P>
   This request comes out of a desperation at once comic and
fearful, as befitting an alternately funny and violent tale of
London criminality, from the lunatic to the thuggish _ which is to
say, from dope-addicted, well-spoken public school boys to seasoned
tough guys with Runyonesque names like Big Chris and Hatchet Harry.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that the movie has become a cultural emblem of the
English phenomenon called ``laddism'' _ rowdy, boys-will-be-boys
behavior that has come to be fashionable and hip. Needless to say,
the laddish world of ``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels''
doesn't readily admit women.
</P>
<P>
   For a while it looked unlikely to admit much of anyone. The
writer-director Guy Ritchie, now 30, couldn't get arrested in film
circles two years ago, when he was touting his first feature around
town. At one point, Britain's Handmade Films were in; four days
before production was to start, the company bailed out, leaving
Ritchie's scarcely more seasoned producer, Matthew Vaughn,
personally $400,000 in debt. (Handmade has subsequently gone
bankrupt.)
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, Vaughn slashed the movie's budget from $5
million to $1.6 million and pushed back the start of filming. Then,
in September 1997, the day before Ritchie was finally due to begin,
one of his leading players _ the English soccer player Vinnie
Jones, a casting wild card in a mostly unknown pack of actors that
includes a few real crooks _ was arrested on charges of assault for
punching a neighbor. ``It was terrifying,'' recalled Vaughn. So is
Jones in the film.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to make a movie and quite another to get it
released, as Vaughn and Ritchie discovered once a rough cut of
``Lock, Stock'' was ready to be shown. ``Every British film company
turned their noses up,'' said Vaughn, 27, the English-born and
educated son of the actor Robert Vaughn, from the Soho offices of
his and Ritchie's production company, SKA films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' recalled Vaughn. ``If you can't get
distribution in England on a British movie, who would be interested
outside England?'' Vaughn was able to bring on board Steve Tisch, a
1994 Oscar-winner for ``Forrest Gump,'' as a co-executive producer
and backer along with the Hollywood restaurateur Peter Morton, who
happens to be Vaughn's godfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were known as `Laughing Stock and Two Smoking Overdrafts,'
'' Vaughn added. (Among those who passed on the movie early on was
Harvey Weinstein of Miramax films.)
</P>
<P>
   Enter Trudie Styler, a producer and environmentalist (not to
mention the wife of Sting, who at her behest took a small role in
the film). Vaughn calls her their ``fairy godmum.'' Having provided
10 percent of the budget, she began talking up ``Lock, Stock''
within the industry and corralling the likes of Tom Cruise to
screenings. ``We planned that Tom would walk in as the room was
full of people,'' Ms. Styler said of an initial Los Angeles
showing, ``and people would go, `What's Cruise doing here?' ''
Afterwards, there was a feeding frenzy of mobile phones, and the
deal was done the next day.'' (Gramercy Pictures is releasing the
film.)
</P>
<P>
   The creators of ``Lock, Stock'' can now discuss its fraught
history with a mixture of wry amusement and relief, insofar as the
film has been a genuine British cinema Cinderella story that looks
poised to do for Ritchie and Vaughn what ``Trainspotting'' did in
1996 for its director-producer team of Danny Boyle and Andrew
Macdonald.
</P>
<P>
   As of last month, the film had taken in a hefty $19 million in
Britain alone, where it was second only to ``Sliding Doors'' among
top-grossing British releases last year, according to Screen
International, an industry newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   After an acclaimed American debut last month at the Sundance
Film Festival, ``Lock, Stock'' is at last set to open in the United
States, to whose indigenous movies this English film has been
largely compared, whether as a loopier ``Mean Streets,'' East
End-style, or as a Tarantino joyride with a Cockney accent.
</P>
<P>
   A representative line from the film might be ``Guns for show,
knives for a pro,'' as jauntily delivered by Dexter Fletcher,
playing one of four not-always-so-tough guys enmeshed in an
all-important payback that devolves _ sometimes bone-crunchingly,
sometimes with deadpan humor _ into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Mention of Quentin Tarantino, perhaps inevitably, doesn't thrill
Ritchie, whereas almost everything else about the spiraling success
of ``Lock, Stock'' does. ``My worst critics have said, `Oh, he just
studied `Reservoir Dogs' night after night,' '' said Ritchie,
referring to Tarantino's 1992 debut about a jewelry robbery gone
awry, ``though I've never seen it all the way through. What
Tarantino did do was open people's eyes to the fact that you can
just have a chat, and that's entertaining viewing. He's a young
filmmaker; I'm a young filmmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Mean Streets,'' ``I nicked a couple of things from
Scorsese,'' said Ritchie, who prefers to cite as inspiration the
1981 British gangster film ``The Long Good Friday,'' ``but whether
he was a conscious influence or a subconscious one, I'm not sure. I
hope I've struck a fresh chord.''
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that Ritchie has tapped into a prevailing
mood. Britain is at the moment in thrall to ``laddism,'' with its
definingly ``bloke-ish'' (that's to say, male and usually
working-class) element surfacing in television shows like the
comedy ``Men Behaving Badly'' and in plays like Nick Grosso's
``Real Classy Affair,'' which was staged at the Royal Court Theater
last fall. The drama tells the story of a group of guys in shiny
suits whose lives revolve around their pub.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It does the film no harm to be associated with a so-called
movement or generation,'' said Tim Southwell, the editor of Loaded,
the English magazine (circulation 475,000) that is credited with
coining the term ``lad'' at the publication's inception nearly five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Lock, Stock' is about four or five lads who end up having a
big adventure and getting in over their heads,'' said Southwell,
who is 34. ``Whether you want to call them overgrown adolescents or
young men or lads, that's up to you.''
</P>
<P>
   It's scant coincidence that a major female character _ Daisy,
the girlfriend of the principal debtor and card shark Eddie (played
by Nick Moran) _ never made the final movie, representing cuts of
25 minutes, or, as Vaughn said, ``a chunk.'' With Daisy, said Ms.
Styler, ``it wasn't a boys' film at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The love story was holding everything up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Loaded was one publication, along with its rival FHM (For Him
Magazine) and Time Out, among others, that got behind the movie in
advance of its Aug. 28 release in Britain, positioning Jones, the
soccer player, as an unexpectedly compelling screen heavy in his
role as Big Chris, and Moran, the little-known leading man, as a
new British heartthrob complete with the requisite killer
cheekbones.
</P>
<P>
   (Moran also appeared in ``A Real Classy Affair,'' making him,
perhaps, London's leading lad.) A hefty marketing budget of nearly
$4 million _ a very high figure for England _ didn't hurt, either.
Before long, ``Lock, Stock'' looked as if it was achieving its
initial goal: to make a movie for people who don't necessarily
attend them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked on so many building sites,'' said Ritchie, a
Londoner who came to directing by way of commercials, videos and
countless stints as a manual laborer, ``painted so many houses, and
the majority of England seems to be made up of the work force. The
humor is based on their humor.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the men in the soccer stands. The result, he
said, is that ``the girls have gone because they've liked the boys;
the boys have gone because they all want to be lads.''
</P>
<P>
   The actors involved, meanwhile, are capitalizing in different
ways on their success. ``Now I go to auditions, and they make tea
and polish your shoes,'' said Moran, 30, who inherited a role that
was at various times talked up for Ethan Hawke and Stephen Dorff
until the filmmakers decided to cast an unknown. ``I made more
money from suits than I did out of doing `Lock, Stock' by far,'' he
added, meaning that he got to keep his clothes from the film. Other
recompense has come presumably from appearing on what he calls
``little newsstands next to Brad Pitt.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, in turn, looks poised to forsake his reputation as, in
his words, ``the bad boy'' of soccer, a label about which he sounds
fairly nonplused. ``There's bad boys in every sport, ain't there?''
he said. At present, he is ready to surpass the fellow soccer
``hard man,'' his friend Eric Cantona, currently on view in
``Elizabeth,'' as a film actor of some potential.
</P>
<P>
   Already signed for Ritchie and Vaughn's next film, ``Diamonds,''
about bare-knuckle boxers and diamond dealers, Jones, who is 33,
speaks of doing an action film in the tradition of Bruce Willis,
Mel Gibson and Cruise. ``That would be my sort of locker, if you
like,'' he said, speaking just two days after finishing 140 hours'
community service for the assault that preceded ``Lock, Stock,''
``if you was putting people in lockers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a business with not a lot of happy endings, this certainly
has a happy ending,'' said the producer, Tisch.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps best of all, at least for the British popular press, has
been the emergence of both Ritchie and Vaughn as available London
playboys, both of whom have been linked romantically at different
times and in different papers with Madonna, whose Maverick record
label is to release the film's soundtrack in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We alternate,'' Vaughn joked when asked about the tabloid
rumors. ``On Mondays, she gets me; on Tuesdays, it's Guy.''

BOXES OPEN, AND HUGHES SEEMS AS REAL AS PLATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (Eds: The Hughes poem `Perfect Light' is included at the end of the
2nd take.) 
(js) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For all the notoriety and ugliness that made them the
century's most talked-about literary couple and divided their
admirers into warring camps, the poets Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath
will remain forever intertwined in the boxes of documents now
emerging from the darkness here at the Emory University library.
</P>
<P>
   Emory, which began buying Hughes' collected papers two years ago
as part of its growing archive of English and Irish writers, has
now begun to catalog and release some of the most important
documents to scholars, just as interest in the British poet
laureate is increasing with the publication of his confessional
``Birthday Letters'' and his death last year.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Hughes' independent reputation has begun to rise,
the papers lead inevitably backward to his seven-year marriage to
Plath, which ended with their separation and her suicide in 1963.
After the publication of her autobiographical novel, ``The Bell
Jar,'' and ``Ariel,'' a posthumous collection of poetry, the
American poet became a feminist icon of victimization, with Hughes
blamed by some for her depression and death.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after her death, Hughes never spoke publicly about
Plath even as he edited and published her work and never publicly
tried to defend himself before her partisans, quietly plowing his
own deep furrow as a symbolist poet in the face of what he
privately called ``Hurricane Sylvia.''
</P>
<P>
   A new trove of letters and papers recently acquired by Emory,
however, show the immense weight that her death held over Hughes in
the next decades, along with the similar suicide in 1969 of the
woman for whom he left Plath, Assia Wevill, who killed their
2-year-old daughter at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep writing this and that, but it seems pitifully little
for the time I spend pursuing it,'' he wrote to a close friend,
Lucas Myers, in 1984. ``I wonder sometimes if things might have
gone differently without the events of '63 and '69. I have an idea
of these two episodes as giant steel doors shutting down over great
parts of myself. Leaving me that much less, just was left, to live
on. No doubt a more resolute artist would have penetrated the steel
doors. But I believe big physical changes happen at those times,
big self-anesthesias. Maybe life isn't long enough to wake up from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jottings in a well-thumbed notebook show him recalling dreams he
has had of Plath, imagining her returning to life to see the
couple's two children, then slipping away again into permanent
sleep. He scrawled poems on the backsides of her own works, using
her old manuscripts in an act of recycling that kept their words
microns away from one another. Hughes seemed to long to separate
his wife's memory from the immense literary industry that had grown
up around her, which he refers to as an ``octopus,'' and struggles
to break out of the ``pyramid tomb of oppression'' produced by the
world's interest in Plath.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this agony is reflected in the poems collected in the
``Birthday Letters,'' his first published work about Plath, which
recently won the Whitbread Prize in England. But Stephen Enniss,
curator of literary collections at the Robert W. Woodruff Library
here at Emory, said the new material would still be a revelation to
Hughes scholars and fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is thought of by critics as being so self-protective and so
unrevealing of himself, but here we can finally see the burden that
he lived with,'' said Enniss, who has been going through some
two-and-a-half tons of papers for the last two years. ``Everyone
always imagined the cost to him personally, but it's remarkable to
encounter his own description of it. I think the archive will make
him appear more human, more sympathetic than the detached voice and
aloofness we had known.''
</P>
<P>
   The archive also includes numerous unpublished drafts of Hughes'
poems, along with uncategorized jottings, photos and legal
documents. These include Plath's passport (showing a beaming
``Sylvia Hughes'' and marked ``Canceled, holder died''), her death
certificate and the couple's marriage license. Enniss said he might
have found some previously undiscovered poems of Plath on the back
of some of Hughes' work but that he had not yet been able to
determine whether they were new.
</P>
<P>
   The papers cast considerable light on Hughes' method of work,
his fascination with natural and occult symbols (he drew a zodiac
wheel on one of Plath's poems) and the sources of inspiration for
the ``Birthday Letters,'' all of which has produced considerable
excitement among Hughes and Plath scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Wood Middlebrook, a professor of English at Stanford
University, said the documents seemed to confirm a theory of hers
that Hughes wrote the ``Birthday Letters'' while assembling Plath's
papers for sale to Smith College, with many of the poems inspired
by specific letters, poems or photographs of her. One poem in the
collection, ``Perfect Light,'' is clearly based on a 1962 photo of
Plath holding the couple's two children in a field of daffodils
behind their home in the west of England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed by the fact that someone who was so private in
life decided not to destroy things of this kind,'' said Ms.
Middlebrook, a biographer of the poet Anne Sexton who recently
wrote an introduction to a new edition of ``The Bell Jar'' and is
planning a book on Hughes. ``I can't wait to see more of this
archive: it's a real jewel of a collection.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Beyond Plath, there is page after page of undiluted Hughes _
painstakingly writing out his poems on the insides of envelopes,
the margins of notebooks, the reverse side of the ``Bell Jar''
typescript. Many of the unpublished poems are from one of his
best-loved periods, when he was writing about Crow, a dark
incarnation of the natural life force. Scholars hope that once they
are published and biographies based on the papers are written,
Hughes will be seen as one of the century's giants, alone in his
own portrait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope people are just about exhausting their interest in
Hughes considered as the husband of Plath and starting to take an
interest in Hughes as a great poet, quite apart from her,'' said
Keith Sagar, a leading English scholar of Hughes and a close friend
for many years. `` `Birthday Letters' is a wonderful book, but the
reason it has sold so well is because it casts the reader into the
role of voyeur. Where were all the readers, where were all the
prizes when Hughes was writing some of the greatest books in the
English language back in the 1970s?''

   `Perfect Light'
</P>
<P>
   There you are, in all your innocence,
</P>
<P>
   Sitting among your daffodils, as in a picture
</P>
<P>
   Posed as for the title: `Innocence.'
</P>
<P>
   Perfect light in your face lights it up
</P>
<P>
   Like a daffodil. Like any one of those daffodils
</P>
<P>
   It was to be your only April on earth
</P>
<P>
   Among your daffodils. In your arms,
</P>
<P>
   Like a teddy bear, your new son,
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks into his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and infant, as in the Holy portrait.
</P>
<P>
   And beside you, laughing up at you,
</P>
<P>
   Your daughter, barely two. Like a daffodil
</P>
<P>
   You turn your face down to her, saying something.
</P>
<P>
   Your words were lost in the camera.
</P>
<P>
   And the knowledge
</P>
<P>
   Inside the hill on which you are sitting,
</P>
<P>
   A moated fort hill, bigger than your house,
</P>
<P>
   Failed to reach the picture. While your next moment,
</P>
<P>
   Coming towards you like an infantryman
</P>
<P>
   Returning slowly out of no-man's-land,
</P>
<P>
   Bowed under something, never reached you _
</P>
<P>
   Simply melted into the perfect light.

 MARTHA GRAHAM: FINDING FRESHNESS IN WORKS OF THE '40s  
(ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is no doubt that Martha Graham is as
old-fashioned as Shakespeare. Anyone shopping around for depth and
universal resonance in the dance world would have to turn to works
like ``Appalachian Spring'' and ``Herodiade,'' two great Graham
works of the 1940s. When they were performed for the first time in
the Martha Graham Dance Company's current season at the Joyce
Theater, on Tuesday night, they were also magnificently danced.
</P>
<P>
   On the novelty side, there was a strange grab bag of a suite
entitled ``Duets for Martha.'' The four duets included
``Histoire,'' a very fine premiere by Lucinda Childs that would
have looked good in a movie by Antonioni, and the U.S. premiere of
an excerpt from Maurice Bejart's ``Notre Faust.'' Two friends of
the company helped out. Robert Wilson was represented by ``Shaker
Interior,'' an excerpt from ``Snow on the Mesa,'' which he created
for the troupe in 1995. After Graham died in 1991, Twyla Tharp was
the first outside choreographer to do a piece for the company,
which was ``Demeter and Persephone'' (1993). But here she was
represented by a duet from the familiar ``Nine Sinatra Songs,''
danced by two guests from American Ballet Theater, John Selya and
Ashley Tuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us, however, might prefer the old hat to the latest
beanie. Genius produced ``Appalachian Spring'' and ``Herodiade,''
and they have worn particularly well. You can even hear an excerpt
from Aaron Copland's score for ``Appalachian Spring'' in a TWA
commercial nowadays. The Library of Congress, through its
distinguished patron Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, commissioned the
Copland score and the music by Paul Hindemith for ``Herodiade.'' To
see the two works on the same program is to recall that they had
their premieres on the same program at the library in Washington in
1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``Appalachian Spring,'' is familiar in its image of a pioneer
couple's frontier optimism. But ``Herodiade'' remains an
experimental, enigmatic work. The heroine onstage, attended by a
faithful maid servant, prepares to meet an unnamed destiny. But the
specifics are never described. Graham is often at her best when she
is at her most hermetic. ``Herodiade'' is a piece to be absorbed
through the pores rather than the brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   The heroine appears to be looking deep into herself. The conceit
is that she is looking into a mirror, evoked by Isamu Noguchi's
striking frame of skeletal shapes, augmented by his sculptured
chair and cloak rack. Certainly Terese Capucilli suggested that she
was involved in an interior dialogue, looking at bones, her
essential self. Advancing and retreating, she violently threw off
Denise Vale's entreaties. Ms. Capucilli shed her outer dress, which
this season is modeled after Graham's loose gray gown with purple
fabric. Purified in a white robe, she wrapped herself in a cloak;
the light caugt her head, dangling backward.
</P>
<P>
   To digest the dance into a date with death would be to ignore
the layers of meaning in Graham's universe. Hindemith named his
score after a poem by Mallarme, but Graham rejected its theme of a
queen of antiquity meditating upon her chastity. In her exploration
of legends, Graham was always probing the psyche of our time. Ms.
Capucilli's acceptance of life through age and death is embodied in
articulate turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   There is a stunning kinetic precision to her movement: energy is
channeled into rage. But Ms. Capucilli no longer turns away in
revulsion from what she sees in the ``mirror.'' It is rather her
determination that colors the entire performance. By contrast, Ms.
Vale's sorrowful nurse is striking in its quiet earthiness and the
beauty of every gesture. One has to look quickly to see how the
attendant takes off her mistress' invisible shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Younger performers were seen in ``Appalachian Spring,'' and here
one commends Miki Orihara for the gorgeous freshness of her dancing
as the frontier bride. She needs only to nuance her two solos so
that the dynamics do not look the same. Katherine Crockett, as the
pioneering woman, was a true voice of wisdom, knowing how to make
her gesture grand without being grandiose.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the men this season are new and have yet to reach the
women's polished level of execution. But Tadej Brdnik's husbandman
caught the spirit of his role and he and Ms. Orihara offered a true
love duet. Peter Roel, more of a veteran, got his vain preacher off
to a dramatic start but needs to make his solo less small-scale.
The preacher's followers, Elizabeth Auclair, Sandra Kaufmann,
Virginie Mecene and Alessandra Prosperi kept the faith and the form
of Graham's idiom.
</P>
<P>
   As for the duets, Ms. Childs had Roel and Ms. Capucilli face in
opposite directions, side by side, before she expanded upon this
idea. In chic dark brown costumes by Suzanne Gallo and Ronaldus
Shamask, the pair resembled a sophisticated couple working out a
relationship that left them where they began. The back-to-back
image was the theme and the variations moved beyond the original
walking. Ms. Capucilli and Roel had a superb worldly polish and
their versatility in a different idiom was admirable. This is a gem
of a piece with the right score, Krzysztof Knittel's ``Histoire
III'' for a harpsichord and tape.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Lofsnes was the devil in red tights and Kenneth Topping
was Faust in black tights, involved in some sort of symmetrical
encounter in ``Notre Faust,'' to music by Liszt. The Wilson duet,
out of context, suggested an encounter between a geisha and a
clown, and Rika Okamoto and Daniel Cardoso were amusing in it. Ms.
Tuttle and Selya were brief and smooth in the Tharp duet.

BOOK TALK: BE AN ART EXPERT IN FIVE MINUTES! 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps it is the tremendous popularity of the ``For Dummies''
series that has made a grail of the idea that art, like the
alphabet, must be intellectually obtainable by anyone with the
least possible thought and effort. Now that quest for instant
accessibility _ some might say it's simply a dumbing-down frenzy _
has, alas, spread into the publication of art books. Many would
argue that mystery and complexity are often the essence of great
art.
</P>
<P>
   Computers, bartending, beauty secrets, basketball, personal
finance: all have lent themselves in the popular books in the
``Dummies'' (and its competing ``Idiot's'') approach. So it's not
altogether surprising that that most venerable publisher of art
books, Harry N. Abrams Inc., in partnership with the Wonderland
Press, has created a sort of Cliff Notes of art. That is, a series
of books of almost primitive simplicity with ``The Essential'' in
the title, like ``The Essential Jackson Pollock'' and ``The
Essential Vincent van Gogh.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams publishes some of the most elegant and sophisticated art
books and museum exhibition catalogs. Paul Gottlieb, its president,
publisher and editor in chief, said that he certainly did not
consider ``The Essentials'' (there are also a Dali and a Hopper in
print and four more to come this spring) ``a dumbing down, and we
would resist any attempt to dumb down.''
</P>
<P>
   He describes ``The Essential'' reader as ``a person who knows
virtually no more than that van Gogh was an artist worth knowing
and understanding, and yet it's very difficult to understand why
he's important to know about.''
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that these are books for people who might
otherwise never be exposed to art but will experience it because of
this series. There's something to be said for that since, for
instance, it wasn't until quite recently that art education was
reintroduced into New York City's public schools after nearly a
quarter-century of absence, Gottlieb said. Of course, another
justification is money. Some 20,000 to 30,000 copies of each of the
four ``Essentials'' are in print, and they sell for $12.95 though
bookstores, gift shops, book clubs and gift and school-supply
catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   The books, each 112 pages, are written by the art smart (the
authors are all critics, and one is a freelance curator as well)
for the art dumb. But while the words may be embarrassingly
rudimentary at times, their printing and the reproduction of the
artwork are in the high-quality tradition of Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   Are these ``Essentials'' an incentive to study art or merely
empty lowbrow calories? Will they inspire someone to go to a
museum? Obviously they are mostly for schoolchildren, but one
imagines they have other uses. If you know naught about art but
have a blind date with someone you have been told is an art buff,
perhaps you can read an ``Essential'' for a quick fix, to give you
something to talk about at dinner. (But suppose you read Pollock
and your date is into van Gogh or Hopper?)
</P>
<P>
   At their worst (and perhaps at their best, too) the books
provide art education through one-liners, sometimes with an
attitude that, if not snide, is flip and condescending.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in listing the artistic innovations of Pollock's
work, there are six pithy paragraphs with these headings, all in
capital letters:
</P>
<P>
   1. New! Larger-Size Canvas for Abstract
</P>
<P>
   2. New! Physical Presence of the Painting
</P>
<P>
   3. New! Painterly Vocabulary
</P>
<P>
   4. New for This Year! Gestural Automatism (Huh?)
</P>
<P>
   5. New and Improved! De-emphasis of the Frame
</P>
<P>
   6. All-New Idea! The Painting as Optical Field.
</P>
<P>
   And the books are stippled with put-downs for the reader as
dunce, i.e.: ``Hello! _ It's paint on canvas!''; ``you get the
picture''; ``van Gogh's first work, very Dutch: cabbages and
clogs.''
</P>
<P>
   It's art education by sound bite, and indeed scattered
throughout each book under the rubric ``Sound Byte'' are meaningful
pronouncements like ``Starting a painting is starting an argument
in terms of canvas and paint,'' an observation by the artist and
author John Graham.
</P>
<P>
   There are some other easy-to-understand, relatively short
paperback art series books of a much higher level, including the
``Discovery'' series, of which Abrams is a publisher, and Thames &AMP;
Hudson's ``World of Art'' series.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the dumbing down of art books and criticism is a
concern to many art critics and historians.
</P>
<P>
   ``With few exceptions the middle discourse has disappeared,''
said David Hickey, a critic for Art Forum magazine and a teacher of
art criticism at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. ``Either the
writing has become so popularized or so hyper-professional. The use
of regular adult English prose about art has almost totally
disappeared. It's now either popularizing by journalists just
throwing stuff together or academics who have their own agendas and
careers to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   There is not complete agreement on this. Peter Plagens, the art
critic for Newsweek, said that he found ``The Essential Vincent van
Gogh'' ``fairly witty and incisive and useful.'' But the owner of
an important art bookstore, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that books like ``The Essentials'' really don't educate.
``They're designed to be a social prop, and that's exactly the
market they are aimed for,'' the store owner said. ``People would
get a better feeling for art paying half the money of one these
books and walking through the doors of a museum.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to make these art books, like the ``Dummies'' books,
so user friendly that they will seduce people with their easy
obviousness. But art is not about assuagement.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Varnedoe, the chief curator of painting and sculpture at
the Museum of Modern Art, said, ``Often there's something difficult
and demanding, and often there's something dangerous about art.
It's mystery, and it's challenging.'' Varnedoe, who wrote the
material for the accessible but sophisticated and highly praised
catalog for the Modern's recent Pollock exhibition (published by
Abrams), said he didn't ``want to handicap art books,'' and
declined to comment about any.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the Modern's understanding of what is truly
essential about Pollock can best be appreciated by what's on sale
in the museum's bookstore. There are Pollock scarves and Pollock
tote bags and, in addition to the catalog, about 10 book titles on
the artist. What isn't being sold is ``The Essential Jackson
Pollock.''

 &HT;    Another generation gap developing
 &HT;    By Tom Walker

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Move over X, make way for Y _ Generation Y, that is.
</P>
<P>
   According to Business Week (Feb. 15), marketers are beginning to
cope with the needs and wants of today's teens, the children of the
Baby Boom generation. At 60 million strong, they make up the
biggest population group other than the 72 million members of the
post-World War II boomer generation.
</P>
<P>
   Born roughly between 1979 and 1994, members of Generation Y
appear to be indifferent to some of the biggest, most successful
brand names of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a gulf between the tastes of boomers and their
offspring. If boomers like baseball, their children choose
skateboards; if boomers liked the Beatles, Generation Y members
like the Spice Girls; if boomers are politically active, their
children are big on community volunteering; if boomers like a Lexus
LS400, the kids will take the Jeep Wrangler.
</P>
<P>
   FIRSTS OF A DIFFERENT KIND
</P>
<P>
   February is a milestone month for two Atlanta-based business
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Trend is out with its first issue under the ownership of
developer Thomas G. Cousins and journalist Neely Young. They
acquired the 14-year-old magazine from Grimes Publications of
Athens. House speaker Tom Murphy is the subject of the magazine's
first cover story under new owners.
</P>
<P>
   Business to Business, launched in 1997 as a quarterly, becomes a
monthly publication with its February edition. It's published by
the Leader Publishing Group, headed by Chief Executive Officer Gina
Wright. The first cover story as a monthly looks at ``women in the
boardroom'' _ and asks ``why aren't we seeing more?''
</P>
<P>
   WORTH MENTIONING...
</P>
<P>
   Individual Investor says it's not too late to get on the big-cap
bandwagon, featuring stocks such as Microsoft, Coca-Cola, or
Pfizer, to mention a few. ...Bloomberg Personal Finance says much
the same thing about technology stocks generally. They are ``wildly
volatile,'' but one good strategy is to ``buy the big brand names,
firms that have a No. 1 position in a growing field of technology.

COMMENTARY: LET THE PERP WALK 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The System worked. What a great country.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, only a couple of months ago, all those dire warnings
out of the White House about the ``national paralysis'' that
impeachment by the House of Representatives would bring? A parade
of sleazy witnesses and a flood of pornographic evidence would, the
Clintonites threatened, tie the Senate in knots throughout 1999.
Furious partisanship would surely rip apart the political fabric.
</P>
<P>
   That did not happen. The House ignored the threats and went
ahead with the first impeachment of an elected president. The
Senate majority leader made good on his prediction that the trial
would take weeks, not months. And while the voices of a prosperous
people murmuring ``don't make waves'' were listened to, the
historic point was also made that the abuse of executive power in
America has its consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the impeachment process, the notion that the
Clinton scandals were ``just about sex'' would have prevailed. The
president's behavior would have been tut-tutted at, but the focus
would have been on bluenosed intrusion into private sin rather than
the use of the power of the presidency to defeat a civil rights
lawsuit and impede a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   That triumph of spin did not happen either. What did happen? In
light of the voters' decision last November that punishment for
high crimes was unwanted, the most that proponents of equal justice
under law could hope for was public understanding of the damage
Bill Clinton had done.
</P>
<P>
   However the vote goes this week, the connect-the-dots
presentation by the managers to the Senate persuaded most Americans
paying attention that the president has (1) directed a campaign of
lies and would still be lying were it not for the blue dress; (2)
disregarded the privacy rights of those who dared to call him to
account, and (3) delivered a heavy blow to the sanctity of the oath
in courts of law.
</P>
<P>
   Removal of a president in the absence of public outrage would be
a Draconian mistake. Impeachment was an ineradicable mark on his
record; the Senate trial was public purgatory. That's a powerful
warning to future presidents contemplating obstruction. The
principled majority of senators can vote to remove Clinton
confident that a nullifying minority will make their condemnation
purely symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   Censure afterward? That would assuage the consciences of many
who feel guilty about casting a vote that effectively condones the
abuses of power. But that grand straddle would engrave over the
portals to the Senate the initials ``C.Y.A.''
</P>
<P>
   In such extraconstitutional punishment-by-exhortation,
reputation, not retribution, is paramount: To its compromising
proponents, it matters not if you convict or acquit, but how you
blacken the name.
</P>
<P>
   No, impeachment and its brief but educational trial will do.
Senators worried about history or the next election can justify
their acquittal votes with speeches in a final chapter to the
official document titled ``Not Guilty With an Explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his allies, in reacting to acquittal, will not be so
foolish as to repeat the pep rally after the House impeachment. No
champagne corks will publicly pop; sobriety with a pinch of
contrition will be the message of the day. But the spin machine, by
its nature, cannot stop itself from pumping out ``much ado about
nothing; purely partisan; all about sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, its Justice appointees (fresh from a cover-up of the
Asian connection) will seek to get even with Ken Starr, even as its
Carvilles will try to purge those Republicans who dared to speak
truth to the power-abusive. That's making a move on ``moving on.''
</P>
<P>
   We who keep hope alive that more of the story will be forced out
can count on that knee-jerk, war-room reaction of the most
vindictive Clintonites.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's non-Monica reports may be mired in molasses, but likely
to come are memoirs of disillusioned aides, toots from
whistle-blowers and straight reporting about an unraveling
administration (and its IRS). These sources may open some of the
hatches that Ruff, Lindsey &AMP; Co. has so fiercely battened down.
</P>
<P>
   That's why we can take heart at how The System Worked. We
underestimated the House and it did itself proud. We trusted the
Senate and it went by the constitutional book. Thus can the nation
say, with Vernon Jordan, ``Mission accomplished.''

<P>
   SAPPORO, Japan _ For most of the year, Lt. Naoki Uchimura leads
a 15-man platoon in charge of Japanese missile systems that are on
the alert to shoot down enemy planes.
</P>
<P>
   But during the last month, Uchimura has faced a creative
challenge that, at one moment, had him hanging his head in shame.
The lieutenant, who has been on a fast track in Japan's defense
forces since he graduated from military academy six years ago, was
charged with creating Bugs Bunny _ in the form of a snow sculpture
the size of a four-story building.
</P>
<P>
   ``My special mission!'' said Uchimura, a lanky 26-year-old with
an easy chuckle. ``I always work with machines. But this is snow,
which is like working with a living thing. And it hardens
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, when snow blankets this island of Hokkaido in the
north of Japan, the city of Sapporo transforms some of its smooth
and spacious streets into outdoor museums of snow and ice. Snow
sculptures line the city's main boulevard, ice crystal sculptures
take up another enclave, and giant snow buildings and ice-glazed
slides sprawl across a military camp that belongs to the 11th
Division.
</P>
<P>
   One year, the city had a snow model of the White House big
enough to hold a small conference. Other years have brought copies
of the Sphinx, Buckingham Palace and the Taj Mahal.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force for this festival in the city that was home to
the 1972 Winter Olympics is Japan's Self-Defense Forces. Drawing
upon the labor of 1,700 people, soldiers began in December to plan
the array of sculptures that dot the city for this one week, ending
Feb. 11, when the weather is its coldest.
</P>
<P>
   The military's closet artists emerge _ the ones who can draw,
the cartoonists, the sculptors. The mathematicians come out too.
Someone has to calculate how much snow is needed to make the
sculptures, how long it will take to transport that snow and how
many truckloads are needed without having to borrow too many
vehicles from the next division.
</P>
<P>
   Sapporo is cold and blizzardy this time of year; snowbanks on
the streets sometimes reach a full story high. While that may be
enough to shape a few small figurines on the edge of the festival,
it is not nearly enough snow to make the life-size palaces,
elephants, village homes, historical figures and theater stages
that have become the signature of Sapporo's Yuki Matsuri, or Snow
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   So, with 250 five-ton trucks, soldiers made 7,600 trips this
year, carting in about 38,000 tons of snow from the mountains. ``It
was so slippery, I couldn't think of anything else except trying
not to get into an accident,'' said Yoichi Narumi, 25, a soldier
who drove one of the trucks.
</P>
<P>
   At the site, soldiers dump the snow into a giant frame made of
steel rods and wood. After it is packed in, the sculptors can
attack the snow with chain saws and chisels.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers made one of the more cultured models this year, a copy
of the 13th-century Buda Castle in Budapest _ with two having
traveled to Budapest for research. The sculptors also reproduced a
Japanese villa of a wealthy herring fisherman, complete with 2,300
tiles made of snow for the traditional rooftop.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of town, Japanese civilians also were trying their
hand at snow sculpture. Kiyohide Sakashita, a 43-year-old city hall
worker, has been coming to chisel snow for 24 years, one year fewer
than his four-member team's leader, Hitoshi Kaido, who runs his own
water engineering company.
</P>
<P>
   The team has an artist, Junya Yamashita, 27, but to avoid
appearing like a know-it-all, Yamashita said quietly that he just
noted the mistakes his buddies make and then corrected them when
they stepped away for a break.
</P>
<P>
   As Kaido was scaling the giant block of ice to hack away at a
chunk, Sakashita explained how they had chosen an image this year
as a symbol of national pride: a traditional Japanese bride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to stick to something traditionally Japanese,''
Sakashita said.
</P>
<P>
   The home team, however, was slightly behind some of its foreign
competitors, who raise funds so they can come for the event. The
team that was racing ahead consisted of Americans, six strong men,
each with a specialized skill in sculpture construction. Gary
Jacketti, for instance, was the brains behind the image, the
American bald eagle. An art teacher with a fine arts degree in
clay, bronze and wood, Jacketti, 40, has skills that gave his team
an advantage over some other groups.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to other teams, which are shoestring affairs, the
Americans have a loquacious team manager, David Russo, who arranges
logistics and promotes the eagle sculpture with pictures of a clay
model.
</P>
<P>
   But teams from hot climes _ places like India, Malaysia and Hong
Kong _ were not to be outdone. As a giant Chinese Ghostbuster began
to emerge from a block of hard snow, Perry K.H. Yuen explained how
his team developed its knack for snow carving.
</P>
<P>
   He has no fancy degrees, but Yuen began sculpturing butter and
chocolate as a chef at the Island Shangri-La Hotel in Hong Kong. He
once carved eight horses, each nearly four feet long, out of
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Japanese soldiers, like Uchimura, are at a
disadvantage. Uchimura's main challenge was to capture the image of
Bugs Bunny. After the statue had gone up, it rained and one of Bugs
Bunny's feet fell off. Uchimura was seen standing alone in front of
the giant sculpture with the collapsed foot, his head hanging low
in shame.
</P>
<P>
   Then, about 10 days before the festival was to open, Warner
Brothers sent a representative to check the likeness and give the
nod to call the image Bugs Bunny. The representative, however, said
the sculpture did not really resemble Bugs Bunny, so Uchimura
ordered the several dozen members of his team to recarve the entire
image.
</P>
<P>
   ``His regular work is destroying planes by shooting missiles,''
said Mitsuo Yamaguchi, an army captain who oversaw the construction
of a snow sculpture about four years ago. ``To do it right, you
have to organize the work very well. Making snow sculptures is the
same. You have to choose who should do what, who should do the
actual sculpturing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the final result was that the sculpture did not look like
the real thing,'' Yamaguchi said. ``It's just like the failure of a
missile to hit its target. In that case, you have to order your
subordinates to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   So in the end, does the sculpture resemble Bugs Bunny? Uchimura
demurred from giving his personal opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not gotten any approval yet,'' he said, in a subtle
admission of defeat, and pointed out that the sculpture, which is
called Looney Tunes, had been officially put into the care of the
city of Sapporo. ``It's not in our hands anymore.''

TEJANO MUSICIANS DEFINED A TIME AND PLACE IN FORT WORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Walk and drive around north Fort Worth, just south of the
Stockyards, with Leo Saenz and you can almost hear the ghosts of a
million long-ago Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   There, on Main Street, is where the honky-tonks were; music
poured out of the first-floor doorways, and the shadier goings-on
were upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away is the site of the old paper plant, which
provided a living for scores of families. And over there was the
Mona Lisa Club, where ``everybody'' played and danced and had fun.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeding over to the corner of Northeast 14th Street and North
Commerce Street, Saenz points out the old San Jose Catholic Church
and its Catholic Men's Club, where the Mexican-American community
gathered for quinceaneras and dances and weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Saenz is pointing all this out, at least in part, to make a
point: The music made back in the '50s and '60s by men like his
father, Nicho, Dick Pacheco and Joe Rodriguez has never been
properly documented or appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these guys, their sons played, too,'' says Saenz, who
began playing drums in his father's band and founded Latin Express,
Cowtown's premier Latin band. ``So a lot of people got their start
because of these guys. I decided I wanted to be a horn player
listening to Dickie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people got their start because of these guys,'' he
says. ``People think Tejano just came around, but these brothers
were knocking it down in the '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the older musicians say, there weren't that many
bands. They played to supplement their day-job incomes. And back in
the '50s, they say, segregation was prevalent: A Mexican-American
who crossed over to the west side of Main Street risked a beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of racism, and not that many places to go and
get together,'' says Nicho Saenz. ``I remember that real clear. The
community was small, and we'd get together at the (Catholic Men's)
Club. We'd play the weddings and festivals.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacheco remembers hooking up with Rodriguez and Nicho Saenz back
in the mid-'50s; they had one amplifier and one microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd go down to Ennis and Corsicana,'' he says, ``and play for
the field workers, the cotton-pickers. We didn't have all the
equipment they have now, but we'd get by.''
</P>
<P>
   The musicians worked hard for little money; several of them
recall ``ping-pong'' nights, when two bands would be booked to the
Rocket Ballroom and the Casino. They'd do a set at one venue and
have 15 minutes to get to the other, where the other band had just
played. Then they'd switch again. And again.
</P>
<P>
   And in doing so, they showed the younger musicians, such as Leo
and Carlos, the ropes. Then the younger generation carried on the
music.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the musicians from back in the '50s, such as Pacheco,
still play. Others don't, having given up the long nights and smoky
bars. But all of them, Leo Saenz says, deserve to be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   He'd like to have regular summit meetings of the old guys, and
eventually record them, before their music is lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna play all the old songs,'' he says. ``It's a
spiritual thing. We need a venue for these old guys. They deserve
it.''

 By BEN BRANTLEY c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ His right hand, so sturdy and thick-fingered, keeps
flying pitifully to his forehead, to what he assumes is the source
of all that pain. He presses at his temples, he pulls at his cheek,
so hard that you're surprised that his face remains intact.
</P>
<P>
   You get the sense that Willy Loman would crush his own skull to
destroy the images inside. The most frightening thing of all is
that you understand exactly what he's feeling.
</P>
<P>
   In the harrowing revival of Arthur Miller's ``Death of a
Salesman'' that opened Wednesday night at the Eugene O'Neill
Theater, 50 years to the day after it made its epochal Broadway
debut, you walk right into the mind of its decimated hero, played
with majestic, unnerving transparency by Brian Dennehy.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Falls' powerhouse staging, first seen at the Goodman
Theater in Chicago last fall, never looks down on Miller's deluded
Brooklyn dreamer or looks ennoblingly up to him as a martyr to a
success-driven country. Instead, it demands that you experience
Willy's suffering without sociological distance, that you surrender
to the sense of one man's pain and of the the toll it takes on
everyone around him.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who had originally titled the play ``The Inside of His
Head,'' has said he thought of having it occur in a set that would
indeed be in the shape of a man's head. Although Falls and his
expert production team are mercifully less literal, that is
effectively the landscape they create here.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn home to which Willy Loman returns from an aborted
road trip at the play's beginning is no stable sanctuary. The
designer Mark Wendland has conceived the rooms of the Lomans' house
as moving platforms that shift into and out of focus, just as Willy
himself is unable to remain fixed in an immediate reality; the
lines between the play's harsh present and Willy's reimagining of
the past have seldom seemed so fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Philippi's lighting floods the stage with a darkness
that is always threatening to consume, the image of the tidal pull
of depression itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening scene the audience's eyes are seared by the
headlights of Willy's car. Dennehy first appears, fabled salesman's
cases in hand, as a sinister silhouette. A jagged, fragmented jazz
score, by Richard Woodbury, slices the air.
</P>
<P>
   When Willy's wife, Linda, played by the sublime Elizabeth Franz,
materializes in her bathrobe on a raised platform, her voice
spectrally amplified as she calls his name, she seems a phantom
whom her husband can't quite summon into full being.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all right,'' Willy says wearily. ``I've come back.'' The
lines, Willy's first, have seldom registered so clearly as lies.
There is admittedly a flavor of melodrama in this insistent air of
urgency, but it doesn't feel disproportionate.
</P>
<P>
   When Linda admonishes the couple's grown sons, Biff (Kevin
Anderson) and Happy (Ted Koch), saying that Willy is ``a human
being, and a terrible thing is happening to him,'' it is not mere
hyperbole.
</P>
<P>
   Linda goes on to conclude the sentence with the famous words
``so attention must be paid.'' That line has traditionally been
held up as a social signpost, a cry to heed the plight of an aging,
insignificant man seduced and abandoned by a capitalist system that
promised unattainable glory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Ms. Franz delivers the words with a rage that seems
shaped by both horrified compassion and selfish fears, they are at
once more particular and universal: when people hurt as Willie
does, it is inhuman to look away.
</P>
<P>
   Scholarly analyses of ``Salesman'' have most often focused on
its political consciousness (surely you remember discussing
``tragedy and the common man'' in high school) or its
expressionistic form. The play certainly provides ample fodder,
including those now clunky-seeming ``j'accuse'' declarations aimed
at the corporate dream machine, for both kinds of dissection.
</P>
<P>
   But these aspects of the drama are secondary to what gives
``Salesman'' its staying power and has allowed it to grip audiences
as far from the United States as Beijing: its almost operatic
emotional sweep in examining one unhappy family and the desperate,
mortally wounded father at its center.
</P>
<P>
   For Falls and his fiercely engaged cast are, above all,
committed to the work's tragic, conflicted familial love story,
between husband and wife, between father and sons.

 &HT;    Trading suspension leaves investors in limbo, too
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier and David McNaughton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Trading suspensions ordered by the Securities and
Exchange Commission on five small companies with a connection to
Madison, Ga., are to end at 11:59 tonight. But before trading in
the stocks can resume, the companies would have to make more
information available to investors.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, investors like Chuck Martin of Pittsburgh and
Phuong Lee of San Jose, Calif., are stuck with stocks they can't
sell, and on which they've already lost money.
</P>
<P>
   They have something else in common: both have been investing in
stocks for a very short time.
</P>
<P>
   Until last month, the 41-year-old Martin had never bought a
stock. He was led to Citron Inc. _ one of the suspended stocks _
from an Eric Clapton online fan club. There was a message on the
site that Citron was providing a link to a Web site for Crossroads,
a rehabilitation facility Clapton helped establish in Antigua.

   ``We'd been looking at investing in Internet stocks since they
had really taken off, and here was one that looked like it was
trying to help a rehab facility,'' said Martin. ``I thought, this
sounds like a good company, this sounds like some honest people.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 26, he bought $1,000 worth of Citron at $39 a share and
$1,000 of Electronic Transfer Associates Inc. at $30 a share. Three
days later, the SEC suspended trading in those two companies as
well as in Polus Inc., Smartek Inc. and Invest Holdings Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions were ordered because the SEC had questions about
the accuracy of information released by the companies. All had used
a Madison phone number at 115 South Main St. as a contact in their
press releases. All are believed to have been based elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The last available stock quote for Citron was $9.93 3/4. For
Electronic Transfer Associates, it was $14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm smart enough to know that when you play with stocks you
have to be ready to take the hit,'' Martin said. ``But it's made me
want to puke.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a 40-year-old software engineer, stands to lose even more
than Martin, a former FedEx employee.
</P>
<P>
   She bought 800 shares of Citron at $25 each and 930 shares at
$22, all on Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Lee had been investing only since last fall, and said she bought
Citron after hearing about it from a friend. Lee said she looked
for information about the company, but couldn't find any.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do a very good investigation,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's rule dictating under what conditions trading in a
suspended stock can resume is designed to make available
information that might have helped Martin and Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Before stock brokers and dealers can offer to buy or sell a
stock that has been suspended, or indicate they are interested in
buying or selling, they to have specific information from the
company, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ The exact name of the company and its predecessor, if any.
</P>
<P>
   _ The address of its principal executive offices.
</P>
<P>
   _ The state of incorporation, if it is a corporation.
</P>
<P>
   _ The number of shares or total amount of the securities
outstanding at the end of the company's most recent fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   _ The name and address of the transfer agent.
</P>
<P>
   _ A description of the company's business.
</P>
<P>
   _ The nature of the products or services it sells.
</P>
<P>
   _ The names of the chief executive officer and members of the
board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   _ The most recent balance sheet and profit and loss and retained
earnings statements, and similar financial information for the past
two fiscal years, or for whatever part of the two years the company
was in existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule is designed to insure that reasonable current
financial information is available for investors to make an
intelligent decision about the investment merits of the company,''
said J. Michael Bishop, a partner with the Atlanta law firm of Page
&AMP; Bacek LLP.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop, a specialist in securities arbitration and litigation,
noted there is an exception to the rule. Brokers and deals can
offer to buy or sell a stock that has been suspended, even if they
don't have the specific information cited in the rule. They can do
so if an investor goes unsolicited to the broker and wants to buy
or sell the stock.
</P>
<P>
   But Bishop also noted: ''The broker or dealer would want to be
cautious in entering a (stock) quotation, since it is unlawful for
a broker to submit the quotation unless he is in strict compliance
with the rule.''

SCUM WHAT MAY, MOM'S THE CLEAN MACHINE

By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Settling back into the brown, faux-Naugahyde seats on the big
yellow bus, those of us who had volunteered to chaperone the
elementary-school field trip were startled to notice a large silver
box secured to the bus's interior, just above the windshield and to
the left of the first-aid kit. ``For Clean Up of Bodily Fluids''
the label said. ``Eeeeuuuwwhh,'' we squealed collectively. ``What
do you think that means?''
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, we already knew. Because we were all mothers.
The unhailed, underappreciated, destined-to-become patron saints of
bodily fluids.
</P>
<P>
   My own full-body immersion into the flow of fluids began soon
after my son Jack's birth, when I was unofficially baptized into
the Divine Order of Dripping Nostrils, Dirty Diapers, Ear Wax and
Nonstop Drool. My son ruined every shirt I owned, depositing chunky
sour milk stains on the shoulders. I started wiping his viscous
drool across my jeans with ease. I handled weighty, wet diapers
with aplomb. I perhaps suspected that all these fluids were
disgusting and that I should have been repulsed. But I didn't see
Gross. I just saw Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Then we moved into toddlerhood.
</P>
<P>
   The level of challenges increased. At this stage on the road to
sainthood, I began, as all mothers do, to dedicate my days to the
service of my preschooler. I began to cut off phone conversations
without warning so I could clean up potty-training accidents. I
woke up, cranky but without fail, for middle-of-the-night bed linen
changes, and I learned to pull snot from my toddler's tiny little
nose during the day and to extract boogers that threatened his
breathing at night. I stocked up on paper towels, diaper wipes and
cleansing agents with bleach and scrubbing bubbles and other battle
agents. No longer the naive novitiate, I found myself smiling
serenely most of the time, as I learned to almost-kiss a slightly
infected boo-boo to make it all better.
</P>
<P>
   I was becoming a seasoned mother, a fact that became apparent to
me only when I leaned across a restaurant table one afternoon to
wipe an especially ugly sleep particle out of a good friend's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting the fluids, my immunities to them gathered strength,
which was good, I suppose, because when my son hit first grade, we
moved steadily into the realm of the extremely vile. Accidents and
illnesses will happen, of course, but at this age kids become
fascinated by the release of bodily fluids and actually even
encourage it. To this day, I carry a mental map of my own
elementary school and can tell you exactly who vomited on which
sets of stairs and when. I remember nothing about a boy named
Steven who was in my second-grade class except that that was his
name, I think, and that he once failed to make it to the
first-floor boys' room on time. My ex-husband liked to recall his
own fifth-grade year, when he and his friends would chug 2-liter
bottles of Coke just for the satisfaction of seeing who would throw
up first.
</P>
<P>
   As my son entered the same wonder years, I knew to expect tests
of a mother's love that would reach biblical proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you can never be fully prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Take one night last week, when Jack was running a high fever and
had gone into the bathroom to brush his teeth before bed. I picked
up a glass of water that looked as if it had undissolved particles
of Crystal Light mix on top. Thinking that Jack must have gotten
himself a glass of lemonade (a sign of self-sufficiency at last!),
I picked up the glass to take a sip just as Jack slumped back into
the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack, what's in here anyway?'' I asked, the glass's rim inches
from my lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's just some throw-up,'' my child explained as he
crawled back under his comforter.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges on the road to sainthood have been both sacred
and sick. I've held my feverish child in bed to comfort him and
been suddenly deluged with this morning's breakfast. I've
sequestered myself with my child in a men's room of a McDonald's
off a highway in Maryland when I heard Jack calling from inside
that he was sick and needed help cleaning up _ and could I bring
some new clothes? I've held Jack's hand with a forced smile on my
face as blood streamed across his cheek from a gouge that would
require seven stitches.
</P>
<P>
   And really, the trials are just beginning. The preadolescent
years with their coming-of-age bodily fluid issues loom before me
as walking-on-coals tests of faith that no amount of Formula 409
can handily wipe away.
</P>
<P>
   Get halo ready.

 NEW YORK: and sons.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The play's most remarkable aspect is that even as it conjures
Willy's grimly distorted worldview, it lets us see clearly his
effect on those around him. In this staging, those people express,
in highly personalized portraits, the genuine pity and terror given
more abstract voice by the choruses of Greek tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live in fear,'' says Linda at one point. Ms. Franz's
astonishing portrayal shatters that character's traditional
passivity to create a searing image of a woman fighting for her
life, for that is what Willy is to Linda. She also emerges as the
only realist in the family, even as she does everything she can to
bolster Willy's sagging illusions.
</P>
<P>
   Watch how Ms. Franz's face changes from taut, smiling
reassurance to a fearful exhaustion the moment Dennehy looks away
from her. The continuing, tremulous nodding of her head registers
as a direct consequence of having worked too hard and too long to
be a reassuring wife.
</P>
<P>
   When she speaks to her neglectful sons in their father's
absence, it is with a fury that scorches. If need be, she will
sacrifice her children for her husband, to whom she clearly
remains, on some level, sexually bonded.
</P>
<P>
   The second and equally important love story in ``Salesman'' is
that of a father and his elder son. And the ambivalent, tentative
dance of courtship and rejection enacted by Anderson's Biff, who
has returned home after a long, self-imposed exile, and Dennehy's
Willy is heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   In his deeply affecting performance, Anderson tempers the
adolescent rage of a man who has never overcome a father's betrayal
with a more profound sense of conflict: the only way to win Willy's
approval is to give in to his fantasies, and that way lies
self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The cocky, callous Happy, sharply drawn by Koch, doesn't bear
the burden of such consciousness, and you can already sense that
one not so distant day he is going to wake up as lonely and
frightened as his father.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the supporting cast is fine, especially Howard Witt
as Charley, Willy's gruff, argumentative and ultimately beneficent
next-door neighbor. A scene set in the more successful Charley's
business office offers the evening's most jolting shock of
recognition. Dennehy, his face inches from Witt's, stares hard, as
though in prelude to a fistfight. What he says, after a long pause,
is: ``Charley, you're the only friend I got. Isn't that a
remarkable thing?''
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy's performance will probably be the most debated aspect
of this production. It is not in the idiosyncratic, finely detailed
vein so memorably provided by Dustin Hoffman in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   What this actor goes for is close to an everyman quality, with a
grand emotional expansiveness that matches his monumental physique.
Yet these emotions ring so unerringly true that Dennehy seems to
kidnap you by force, trapping you inside Willy's psyche.
</P>
<P>
   The rhythms of his performance are exactly those of the play
itself, in which every scene moves from artificially inflated
optimism into free-falling despair. Dennehy's eyes go bleak and
fearful even as that broad salesman's smile splits his face. He
continually brings his finger to his lower lip, like a fretful
child, as though suddenly forced to remember what he had been
trying so very hard to forget.
</P>
<P>
   It is also jarring, and utterly appropriate, to see such a large
man physically pushed around by the other, smaller men in the play.
And I will always be haunted by the image of Dennehy's infantile
fragility when he shields his face with his hands, palms outward,
before an angry, confrontational Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   In art, greatness and perfection seldom keep close company, and
the flaws of ``Salesman'' are apparent here: the contrived,
detective-story-like exposition of why Biff resents Willy; the
unfortunate moments of speechifying, especially in the final
requiem scene, and the iconic presence of the fantasy figure of
Willy's older brother, Ben (Allen Hamilton, who looks a bit too
much like Colonel Sanders here) as the American Dream incarnate.
</P>
<P>
   Watching ``Salesman'' in this production, you acknowledge the
flaws, but only fleetingly. In willing himself into the imagination
of a small-time, big-thinking loser, Miller generated an immense
natural force of empathy that, oddly, he never equaled in his more
autobiographical works, like ``After the Fall.''
</P>
<P>
   I could hear people around me not just sniffling but sobbing. I
feel sure that audiences for ``Salesman'' will be doing the same
thing 50 years from now.

Nick Nolte's mastery commands this woeful tale 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIW MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doom seems inevitable in writer//director Paul Schrader's
adaptation of Russell Banks' novel ``Affliction.'' Snowbound, the
small New Hampshire town where the story is set, is bleak and
unforgiving. Spiritually, it's a backdrop that Schrader, as the
writer of ``Taxi Driver'' and the writer//director of ``American
Gigolo'' and ``Light Sleeper,'' has used almost all his career.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, his protagonist doesn't exist as a solitary
figure, an alienated loner in a sleek, grim city. Instead, Schrader
drops us into the burg that Wade (Nick Nolte) can't escape and
shows us the damage that led to his main figure's current state.
</P>
<P>
   As Wade, the lawman, Nolte is determined, decent, but lost. He's
almost incapable of doing the right thing. Trying to get to the
bottom of a hunting-related death, Wade is well-meaning, but all
his gestures are abrasive. He can't help rubbing people the wrong
way, being insistent when he shouldn't be. It's as if he were born
with no spaces between his fingers. Burly and big-spirited, he
shambles into a crime scene, or a kids' Halloween party, where it's
evident that even his little girl is wary around him. An ominous
narration by Wade's brother (Willem Dafoe), who had fled their
hometown, tellingly frames the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affliction'' is a little rough around the edges. Partially
because Nolte, who received a Best Actor nomination for this role,
is so good that the rest of the movie seems a little threadbare.
Canada was substituted for New England, and many of the actors have
accents and a genteel quality that sticks out. (As with many other
pictures, Canada was used because it's cheaper.) But Schrader's
ease with actors has increased. ``Affliction'' is affecting because
it doesn't feel nearly as schematic, or inexorable, as it might.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Glen (James Coburn) _ Wade's abusive, constantly drunk
father _ enters the picture. Despite his Best Supporting Actor
nomination, Coburn's badly used here. He's all elbows and grimace.
He's the wrong actor for a part like this _ fury and soiled
bitterness. In flashbacks, when we first see him, Glen snarls and
belts his boys, and it's painful to watch. Schrader has built so
painstakingly toward this revelation that we want Glen to match
Wade more convincingly. Coburn's facility is polish and slickness;
we don't quite buy him. Though in the present day, when he's
curdled and spent, Glen's more affecting _ a dying monster.
</P>
<P>
   There can't be much more than a 10-year age difference between
Nolte and Coburn, but because they're of divergent generations _
and techniques _ as actors, they're believable as father and son.
Coburn is all surface. Nolte burrows in so deep, it's as if he's
discovering his character before our eyes. He's all invention;
there's no complacency in him as an actor. Schrader has talked
about having to wait for Nolte to be available to start the picture
and that he was determined to use him. It was worth the wait.
Nolte's physical eloquence and expressiveness take up the entire
picture. He invests the film with a freshet of emotion _ a needy,
searching quality _ that we've not seen in Schrader protagonists
before. They tend to be either angry or depressive, and Wade is
both. Although he lacks self-knowledge, Wade isn't stupid, which is
why his rage causes him as much trouble as it does those around
him.
</P>
<P>
   It's good to see Sissy Spacek again _ she plays Wade's
girlfriend, a refuge from the losses inflicted on him in every
other relationship in his life. She's mostly just the understanding
woman here. Mary Beth Hurt, in a fleeting role as Wade's intolerant
ex-wife, makes a much more vivid impression. Intriguingly, it's not
just the women in Wade's life who have a perspective on him. Sadly,
everyone understands Wade all too well. It's hard to imagine that
Schrader, with his love of cold European archetypes, could show
such a keen insight into the most American of themes, the ache in
the folly of good intentions. (He and Banks are made for each other
in this case _ the story seems to have autobiographical resonance
for Schrader.) But Nolte continues in his trajectory of surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affliction'' is rated R for violence, adult situations and
adult language.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a dramatic quickening of the 2000 presidential
campaign, more than 50 current and former Republican members of
Congress pledged ``our commitment'' Wednesday to a White House
candidacy by George W. Bush and urged the Texas governor to enter
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Styling themselves the Draft Bush 2000 Committee, the
legislators represent constituencies from across the country as
well as across the Republican ideological spectrum, including at
least two female House members who support abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the emphasis was on the party's broad conservatism in a
letter that the group drafted and is sending to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, as members and former members of the U.S. House of
Representatives, committed to the Republican ideals of less
government, lower taxes, personal responsibility and a strong
national defense, hereby ask you, because of your exemplary
performance as governor of Texas and adherence to these ideals to
commit to running for the office of president of the United
States,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   By late Wednesday, the letter had been signed by 44 current
House members, one senator who is a former House member _ Ben
Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado _ and 15 former House members no
longer in national office. A spokesman said additional signatures
were being gathered and an attempt was under way to include state
and local officeholders.
</P>
<P>
   The group, led by recently retired Rep. Gerald Solomon of New
York, had been considering its course of action for some time, a
source said. It was moved to announce its formation, the source
said, by the publicity splash made recently by Elizabeth Dole, the
former Republican &UR;  &LR; Cabinet member and wife of the GOP's 1996
presidential nominee, as she moves toward formal announcement of a
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll among Republicans in New Hampshire, traditional site
of a presidential campaign's first primary, showed Dole had zoomed
into a virtual tie with Bush, who once held a commanding lead in
the New England state.
</P>
<P>
   Dole campaigned Monday in New Hampshire as the poll was being
released. She will be speaking in Houston at a sold-out charity
luncheon Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bush's House backers was quick with a bid to dampen
Dole's effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has not been a governor, and she's never held elected
office,'' Rep. Scott McInnis, R-Colo., told the Pueblo Chieftain
newspaper Tuesday as he announced his support for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But McInnis said Dole, most recently president of the American
Red Cross, would be ``the best choice'' for Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Another draft committee source took a fairly dismissive tone
toward other possible Bush opponents for the nomination, saying
that while all of the Republican contenders would have ``good ideas
to offer. We think George W. Bush is the total package.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said the draft committee was the biggest, earliest
outpouring of House Republican support for a prospective
presidential candidate since a 1979 effort urging Ronald Reagan to
run.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, one of the other GOP prospects was Bush's father,
who subsequently was Reagan's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said the committee's effort was ``an absolutely
independent movement'' from the governor's political operation.
Solomon said he had talked with Bush several times, ``but he is not
asking me to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he will announce a decision on a presidential bid
later this year, probably after the Texas Legislature adjourns in
late spring. Bush could announce formation of a preliminary
exploratory committee sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman in Austin, Texas, said the
governor ``is honored that fellow Republican elected officials
recognize that he is a principled conservative who has proven his
ability to reach across party and gender and ethnic lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hopes they understand that he has commitments to fulfill
here in Texas,'' Hughes said. ``He is in the process of making a
decision and assures them that as quickly as possible this spring
he will announce what his decision is.''
</P>
<P>
   While some other prospective Republican candidates have
belittled Bush's call for ``compassionate conservatism,'' the
legislators hailed the governor's stance as a call to women and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``A message of inclusion is one which the Republican Party needs
to put forward,'' said Rep. David Dreier of California, chairman of
the House Rules Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Only four of the 13 House Republicans from Texas initially
signed the letter, part of what Rep. Pete Sessions, R-Dallas, said
was an effort to keep the list from being top-heavy with Bush's
fellow Texans. Signing the letter with Sessions were Republican
Reps. Kay Granger of Fort Worth, Joe Barton of Ennis and Sam
Johnson of Plano.
</P>
<P>
   Other states represented by signers are: Alabama, Alaska,
Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa,
Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, New
York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Virginia,
Washington and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The signers included pro-abortion rights Reps. Jennifer Dunn,
R-Wash., and Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, one of the more
liberal House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Roukema's signing prompted the archconservative Solomon to
remark: ``When you've got everybody from Marge to me, you've got
about everybody.''

an actor. I hope I'm the reason he doesn't win an Oscar.''

JASPER JURY CHOSEN IN DRAGGING DEATH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ A jury of seven men and five women, including at
least one black, was picked Wednesday to decide the fate of a white
man accused of capital murder in the brutal dragging death of a
black man.
</P>
<P>
   John William ``Bill'' King, 24, is one of three white men
charged with chaining James Byrd Jr. to the back of a pickup and
dragging him about three miles along back country roads in the
early morning hours of June 7.
</P>
<P>
   It took lawyers about 20 minutes Wednesday to pick 12 jurors and
two alternates from a pool of 50 citizens certified to serve as
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Joe Bob Golden conducted the striking
process in the jury deliberation room so that news reporters
couldn't hear who was being chosen for the final pool.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray said only that
the jury is ``not all white,'' refusing to say how many of the
seven black certified panel members are on the jury. Gray said
Golden wants to protect the jurors from being identified.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is scheduled to begin hearing testimony Tuesday. If
King is convicted of capital murder _ killing Byrd while kidnapping
him _ he faces either death by injection or life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's father, James Byrd Sr., said he was happy to hear that at
least one black person will be on the jury. ``I think it'll be
fair,'' he said. ``That's all we want is justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile King, who twice before has written letters to
newspapers, wrote another letter to the Jasper NewsBoy. Much of the
letter was in praise of Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sheriff Rowles, I am genuinely thankful for the kindness and
generosity you have extended to my family as well as myself,'' he
wrote. ``I truly appreciate all you've done, and the lengths at
which you've gone to ease some of the stress and frustrations
during a time of despair.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowles said he has treated King like any other inmate. He said
the letter was ``embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowles said King, who at one time tore up his cell and broke a
television during a tantrum and once refused to leave his cell for
a court hearing, has calmed down since his trial started. The
sheriff is also letting him smoke cigarettes during court breaks.
Smoking isn't allowed in the county jail.
</P>
<P>
   During one break King also was allowed a brief visit with his
father, girlfriend and his 6-month-old child. It was the first time
he'd ever been allowed to hold his son.
</P>
<P>
   That visit prompted Byrd's mother, Stella, to say that when she
wants to visit her son she has to go to his grave.
</P>
<P>
   Trials for Shawn Allen Berry, 23, and Lawrence Russell Brewer
Jr., 31, also charged with Byrd's murder, have not been scheduled.

was dusted off by a federal appeals court in Virginia and used to
declare that federal law enforcement officials need not follow one
of the best known Supreme Court decisions of this century, Miranda
vs. Arizona, under which criminal suspects are routinely read their
rights everywhere in America. From coast to coast, prosecutors,
defense lawyers and legal experts said the ruling provided the most
serious challenge to the Miranda ruling since it was issued in
1966, and opened an unexpected debate about one of this country's
bedrock legal rules. By William Glaberson. 1,600 words.

JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES STAND TRIAL IN MOSCOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Seven years ago, Nikolai Cherevatov, then a Moscow
University student, told his parents that his search for religion
had led him to Jehovah's Witnesses, one of the fastest-growing
proselytizing religious groups in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very upset,'' recalled Cherevatov, now 31 and a
devout follower of the religious community that is now before a
Moscow court, accused of inciting religious discord and threatened
with a ban on its activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papa said they were agents of the American CIA who would give
me a gun, and tell me to shoot my parents if there was a war,'' he
said. ``Mama said no good could come from a close reading of the
Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child in a Ukrainian village, Cherevatov spent Sunday
mornings in the local Russian Orthodox Church with his grandmother.
Later, when he joined the Young Communist League, he had to stop
going to church. But as soon as religious freedom dawned in the
ruins of the Soviet empire, he began exploring his faith.
</P>
<P>
   His journey began inside Russian Orthodoxy, but in the end led
him out of it _ a trajectory that has been repeated by hundreds of
thousands of other Russian Christians, and set off alarms in the
Russian Orthodox church about inroads into their flock made by what
its priests call ``totalitarian sects.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The script is always the same,'' said Cherevatov. ``I left my
church, I betrayed the beliefs of my forefathers, of my country.
But nobody ever asks why I left the church. It was not fanaticism
that led to this choice, it was common sense. Now I have a
comparison to make. ``
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 law on religion restricted nontraditional denominations,
and after that, the Orthodox church kept pressures on its rivals.
Last August, Aleksei II, patriarch of the Russian Orthodox church,
called for a ban on proselytizing faiths, particularly those that
try to lure people away from the ``religions of their ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   The case now before a Moscow civil court is being closely
watched by religious and human rights groups as the first
significant attempt to use the law to restrict worship. Also
watching will be Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who raised
the case with her Russian hosts during a recent visit, and the U.S.
Senate, which has on its books a law that links American aid to
Russia to religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge agrees with the prosecutor, the Jehovah's Witnesses
_ an aggressively proselytizing community with 130,000 believers in
Russia _ could lose their legal status and be banned in Moscow,
where 10,000 followers reside. Technically, their national status
would not be affected, but many fear that such a ruling would only
encourage local judges to follow suit, and not only against the
Jehovah's Witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are successful in this case, then it will be
terrible,'' said Lyudmila Alekseyeva, president of the
International Helsinki Federation, ``because after that, they will
feel free to attack other groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Alekseyeva, long a campaigner for human rights, said that
``in a closed society like Russia, people don't like anything that
is not `ours.' When I ask people what is so dangerous about the
Jehovah's Witnesses, nobody can answer, but they are sure they are,
anyway. But this is not a theological problem. It is a human rights
problem.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The atmosphere at a hearing of the case on Wednesday, in a grimy
court building in a neighborhood north of the Kremlin, carried
faint hints of Soviet times when political and religious dissidents
were shuffled from trial to trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, more than 100 Jehovah's Witnesses in wool coats
and soggy boots gathered silently outside the courtroom doors. Many
said they were prepared to wait as long as it took, even weeks, for
the judge to reach a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cherish our truth,'' said Lena Sijanova, 27, who joined the
Jehovah's Witnesses along with her mother. ``And they are trying to
take it away. But you cannot forbid people's right to their faith
because that right comes only from God.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint filed by a Moscow district
prosecutor, the Jehovah's Witnesses have violated the 1997 law by
preaching religious discrimination, breaking up families and
withholding medical treatment _ all in the name of their ``one true
religion.'' After an exhaustive textual analysis of literature
disseminated by the Witnesses' door-to-door proselytizers, the
prosecutors concluded that ``overseers,'' both in Russia and
abroad, ``not only control the spiritual environment of the
congregation, but also subject the manner of life, thinking, psyche
and conduct of every member of the sect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sect has a strong anti-government, antisocial and
anti-traditional as well as anti-Christian orientation,'' the
prosecutors said. More than 21 witnesses are prepared to testify to
the damage allegedly wrought by the Jehovah's Witnesses on their
family lives and finances.
</P>
<P>
   Written testimony has been provided by a top expert from the
Serbski Center for Social and Forensic Psychiatry _ notorious in
Soviet times for its ``treatment'' of dissidents _ who found that
``the teaching and activity of Jehovah's Witnesses contains factors
that may lead to neuroticism and a state of depression.''
</P>
<P>
   But the essence of the case is strangely enough theological,
presenting the unlikely scenario of a district court judge, born
and trained in Soviet state atheism, sorting through arguments
about the coming of Armageddon and views of relative religious
superiority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amounts to a theological discussion,'' said Albert
Polanksi, the Moscow representative of the Witnesses' world
headquarters. ``And yet, Jehovah's Witnesses are recognized by the
Council of Europe, and as Russia is a member, we should be fully
protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's religion law was amended slightly after an original
version drew protests from the U.S. Congress and Pope John Paul II.
According to the final version, churches and religions that have
not been functioning in Russia for the past 15 years must
re-register with the Ministry of Justice by the end of 1999. With
that bureaucratic noose still hanging over their necks, many
nontraditional religions have tried recently to tread softly in
Russia.

CLINTON ON CUSP OF HISTORIC VICTORY IN IMPEACHMENT FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton appeared Wednesday on the cusp of
a historic victory in his impeachment fight with Congress as three
Republican senators broke ranks to say they will vote against
conviction even as a campaign to censure the president was
collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   The final Senate verdict vote on Thursday or Friday would mark
the finale to a sex scandal that has consumed the White House and
Congress for months.
</P>
<P>
   The three Republican senators who indicated they will vote
against convicting Clinton are James Jeffords of Vermont, Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania and John Chafee of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   All three said they believed the charges against Clinton weren't
sufficiently serious to merit his conviction and automatic removal
from office. The House impeached Clinton in December for perjury
and obstruction of justice in connection with the cover-up of his
sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a leader in the push
for censure as an alternative to conviction, said she may circulate
a petition among senators to allow them to indicate their support
for censure even though they won't actually have a floor vote on
censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way or another, it's going to see the light of day,''
Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, who has redrafted a censure resolution more than two
dozen times, pleaded with Republicans to allow a floor vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people on the Republican side who adamantly oppose
our ability to bring this to the floor,'' Feinstein said, adding
that they should debate censure rather than block it. ``At least
give us an opportunity to bring it to the floor. Right now that is
not happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., another supporter of censure,
said censure advocates would sign a statement Friday that would
contain the same language that would have been in a censure
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference is, instead of voting for it, members
would sign it'' and it would become part of the congressional
record and be sent to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Senate foes of censure, led by Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, have
threatened to use parliamentary tactics to derail any vote on
censure. Graham believes a censure violates the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said he would kill any censure proposal by filibustering
against it. That would require Feinstein and her allies to muster
60 votes to shut down the filibuster and it was unlikely that she
could gather that much support..
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, also signaled censure is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think censure is becoming more and more problematic and
difficult,'' Hatch said, adding that some say that Democrats ``just
want to cover their backsides'' by pushing censure so they don't
appear to approve of Clinton's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who said he was ``in a distinct
minority'' as a Republican who favors censure, said members of his
party fail to realize that a harshly worded censure would serve to
``elevate the actions of the House.'' The Republican-led House
approved two articles of impeachment against Clinton in December,
charging him with perjury and conspiracy to obstruct justice.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert J. Kerrey, D-Neb., summed up the fate of censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bird without wings,'' Kerrey said.
</P>
<P>
   The defection of the three Republican senators raised the
prospect that the verdict vote on Thursday could fall short of a
51-vote majority. Such an outcome would be embarrassing to
Republicans, who hold a 55-45 majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It's been apparent for weeks that the House prosecutors would
fail to win the 67 votes _ a two-thirds majority _ needed to
convict the president. A 51-percent majority in favor of conviction
would still add up to acquittal but would give House Republican
prosecutor bragging rights that even though they failed to get 67
votes, at least they persuaded a simple majority of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The perjury article was stacking up as the weaker of the two
impeachment accusations. Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., announced he
planned to vote against the perjury charge, while other Republicans
have indicated they are leaning the same way.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his plan to vote to acquit Clinton, Chafee said
House prosecutors hadn't proven their case.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee said that while the president exhibited ``reckless,
tawdry behavior,'' much of the evidence was ``conflicting'' and
doesn't rise to the standard that merits removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords, another moderate, said that while the facts and
circumstances of the case are ``low and tawdry,'' they do not rise
to the level of impeachable acts. Jeffords predicted the
obstruction of justice charge would get no more than 48 votes and
that there would be ``considerably less'' support for a perjury
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords said he hoped ``we will get a very well done apology
from the president. I hope he apologizes to the children and the
women of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter, announcing he won't vote for conviction, cited the laws
of Scotland for his concept that there could be ``three possible
verdicts: guilty, not guilty, not proved.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he would choose to vote ``not proved.'' He said
only ``partial justice'' was done because House prosecutors hadn't
been able to call live witnesses.

EAST TIMOR LEADER'S TRANSFER FROM PRISON COMES AS TALKS HEAT UP
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ With Indonesia edging toward a new status
for the disputed territory of East Timor, officials Wednesday moved
the independence leader, Alexandre Gusmao, halfway to freedom,
transferring him from a prison to a barred and guarded house.
</P>
<P>
   Clenching his fist briefly in a modest salute, the trim and
bearded Gusmao said he expected to play a full role, from his new
home, in international negotiations over whether the former
Portuguese colony is to become independent or remain linked to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always optimistic about independence in East Timor,'' he
said. ``We know that negotiation on many conflicts in the world
have run for years. If all parties are not willing to reduce the
violence and hatred, the dialogues are useless.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a number of other East Timorese leaders, Gusmao, 52, who
has been in prison for seven years for his role in leading a
separatist insurgency, has recently argued against moving too
rapidly toward freedom or even toward a referendum on freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Since Indonesia invaded the remote and tiny territory in 1975,
annexing it the next year, human rights groups say, up to 200,000
people have died in fighting and human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions have grown hotter, and renewed violence has flared in
recent weeks as Indonesia has, for the first time, said that it was
ready to consider loosening its grip on the territory.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, which has never recognized Indonesian
sovereignty in East Timor, is brokering talks over the status of
the territory, which Indonesia claims as its 27th province.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, who met his Portuguese counterpart
in New York over the weekend, said last week for the first time
that Indonesia would consider full independence if the people of
East Timor rejected a new autonomous relationship with Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he ruled out holding a referendum on status, a vote
that many East Timorese are demanding, saying it could lead to
civil war among opposing factions.
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao, who is popularly known by his nickname, Xanana, has said
he is also concerned about the possible destabilizing effects of a
referendum. He said such a vote should be held only after a 10-year
period of social reconciliation and economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic negotiations are focusing on what status to seek for
East Timor, how soon and how to determine what it should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question now is just to find out how we are going to
consult the people of East Timor,'' said Joao Carrascalao, a former
governor of the territory and an advocate of separation from
Indonesia. Carrascalao has also said he believes that after
independence has been granted East Timor would need the presence of
a United Nations peacekeeping force for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   The East Timor talks are a chief product of the ``reform''
period overseen by President B.J. Habibie since President Suharto's
ouster in May.
</P>
<P>
   But like other changes, the opening of debate and the loosening
of harsh controls have given rise to new uncertainties and violent
confrontations. Separatist guerrillas who had become dormant in the
hills grew active again.
</P>
<P>
   In a controversial move, the Indonesian military, which says it
has pulled its combat troops out of East Timor, recently began
arming untrained civilians, ostensibly to provide security.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups say they fear that those irregular soldiers
may be trained to fight against the guerrillas. Given the
bitterness that infuses the territory after more than 20 years of
fighting, some diplomats warn that the moves toward a peaceful
resolution could instead cause a surge of bloodshed.

GRAMM HAS HISTORY OF STUBBORN (AND OFTEN SUCCESSFUL) RESISTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories: IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-DEBATE, IMPEACH-SCENE,

 (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Comity is the grease that allows the Senate to run.
That is why Sen. Phil Gramm, who has a propensity for throwing sand
in the Senate's gears, stands out so starkly.
</P>
<P>
   His determination to block a bipartisan move to censure
President Clinton is completely within character. Year after year
since he has been in politics, Gramm, the staunchly conservative
Texas Republican has frustrated his colleagues on matters he has
felt strongly about, and more often than not, he has gotten his
way.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, for instance, Gramm almost single-handedly
blocked a Senate vote on a carefully arranged compromise bill that
would have lifted some of the barriers separating commercial banks,
investment banks and insurance companies. Never mind that
supporters of the bill were among the largest benefactors of the
Republican Party and that the chief sponsor of the Senate
compromise, Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., badly wanted the bill to pass
to help in his re-election race, which he ultimately lost.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier last year, Gramm led the opposition to legislation that
would have raised cigarette taxes and permitted more government
regulation of tobacco companies. Never mind that the chief sponsor
of the tobacco bill was his best friend in the Senate, John McCain,
R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   ``In dealing with his peers, he often doesn't observe the
traditional niceties,'' said a former staff member who insisted on
not being identified.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's press secretary, Larry Neal, expressed what is doubtless
the senator's self-image: ``There will always be a
Horatius-at-the-gate element to him.'' Horatius was a legendary
Roman hero who, with two lone companions, held an invading Etruscan
army at bay.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, 56, who is his 15th year in the Senate, seems to
delight in being cantankerous, even when his allies call him a
nuisance and his enemies call him much worse.
</P>
<P>
   He regularly jokes about his reputation for being mean. He cites
the evident affection of his wife, his staff and his dog. And at
least once he told a dinner audience that he really did have a
heart, adding after the requisite pause, ``I keep it in a quart jar
on my desk.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the Senate's consideration of impeachment
this year, Gramm played the surprise role of conciliator. He and
his ideological opposite, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., sold the
Senate on a plan that allowed the trial to begin and deferred a
decision on summoning witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But now he is back in his familiar position as a roadblock. Most
Democrats and some Republicans favor a resolution to censure
President Clinton after the vote to remove him from office fails.
</P>
<P>
   To pass, such a resolution would require 51 votes, a simple
majority, which might be possible, but Gramm has vowed to block the
vote. Under the rules, it would take 60 votes, probably an
unattainable number, to bypass him.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's opposition to censure is both practical and
political. As a practical matter, he said Sunday on the NBC News
program, ``Meet the Press,'' it would open the door for the Senate
to vote censure whenever it disapproved of actions by a president _
when, for instance, ``a future Harry Truman fires a future General
MacArthur.''
</P>
<P>
   Politically, he said, he did not want to give the senators who
vote not to remove Clinton from office the ``political cover'' of
being able to say officially that they disapprove of Clinton's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   There is hardly a more formidable opponent in the Senate, in
large part because Gramm is so smart, so tenacious and so quick on
his feet in debate. In an interview last year on another topic,
Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said he expected that on an
intelligence test, Gramm, who has a Ph.D. in economics, would score
higher than anyone else in the Senate. Coincidentally, Bennett is
now one of the leading Republican proponents of censure.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's apparent lack of concern about irritating his colleagues
has been the dominant characteristic of his years in Congress. He
was elected to the House as a Democrat in 1978, and in 1981, at the
beginning of his second term, he was put on the Budget Committee
after signing a promise to Democratic leaders that he would be
loyal to the party's budget. Instead, he secretly collaborated with
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   When Democratic leaders retaliated in 1983 by kicking him off
the Budget Committee, Gramm quit the party, resigned from the
House, was handily re-elected as a Republican in a special election
and then, in 1984, was elected to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   When Gramm ran for the 1996 Republican presidential nomination,
his sometimes abrasive personality came back to haunt him in the
early contests in small states where personal contact with voters
can be crucial. He finished an embarrassing fifth in the Iowa
caucuses and dropped out of the race before the New Hampshire
primary, when polls there showed him far behind.
</P>
<P>
   With his presidential race behind him, Gramm has thrown himself
into the business of the Senate, becoming centrally involved not
just in the impeachment trial but in almost all the major
legislation before Congress. In an interview in January, he said
his main goal this year was legislation that would turn Social
Security into a mostly private system in which workers controlled
their own retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton opposes this approach. Gramm said he was not even
thinking about compromise.

WHAT AN ARTIST LEARNED FROM THE WORKS SHE CREATED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, N.Y.)   By   EDWARD M. GOMEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUDSON, N.Y. _ La Wilson recently made a journey through a
snowstorm from her art- and book-filled home in Hudson, Ohio, to
Hudson, N.Y., to show her newest work at a gallery in this growing
upstate center of art and antiques dealers. At first the
coincidence of identical town names seemed almost too cute to suit
the unaffected character of Ms. Wilson, a 74-year-old mostly
self-taught maker of box sculptures that are as quietly enigmatic
as she is genial and straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then,'' she said, ``I got it. It fit. It made sense that I
should travel from Hudson to Hudson to present this work.''
</P>
<P>
   That Zen-like remark baffled some guests at the opening of her
show, which runs through the end of the month at the Davis &AMP; Hall
Gallery on Warren Street, Hudson's main thoroughfare. But for Ms.
Wilson and her dealer, John Davis, an Ohioan whose soft-spoken
manner belies a grit nurtured by many seasons in the art world, the
artist's comment was simply the last word _ for now _ on a creative
relationship that has spanned nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I offered her a show the day I met her,'' Davis said recently.
``That was at my first tiny gallery, in Akron. We painted the walls
pink and purple, hauled in La's furniture and piano, and recreated
her home for a show of 90 pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Davis and his business partner, Frank Hall, an
architect, opened their gallery for contemporary art and unusual
antiques _ school worktables, famous-building souvenirs, taxidermy
items _ in Hudson after a long run in downtown Manhattan. They
first operated an art gallery in SoHo in the late 1980s and then an
antiques-cum-home-design store called Sammy's, before the
district's art galleries began giving away to designer clothing
chains. ``It became boring and expensive,'' Davis said. ``It was
time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, meanwhile, a fire destroyed part of Ms. Wilson's
studio. ``So this show is about survival,'' the artist said.
``Where else could I have shown these new pieces but with John?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilson grew up in Corning, N.Y., where her first name, Mary,
gave way to her childhood nickname, La, which she has used ever
since. She describes herself as shaped by the values of the 1940s
era in which she came of age. Marriage to a lawyer took her to
Ohio, where she reared her three children. (She also kept rabbits,
a dog and, at one time, a crow.)
</P>
<P>
   Around that time Ms. Wilson began dabbling in art, but her only
formal instruction came from a two-year course for adults at the
Akron Art Institute in the 1950s. ``I started making boxes after I
had done some thickly painted, nearly sculptural pictures,'' she
said. ``It all developed little by little, accidentally. The art
sort of found me.'' It also became her refuge from life's
vicissitudes, including divorce, family illnesses and the fire.
</P>
<P>
   First impressions of her work suggest that the artist has
perfected a scavenger-tinkerer's practice of stumbling upon old
wooden packing boxes and stuffing them full of industrial doodads
and the detritus of mass production. But the magic of her art,
which is about examining, collecting, sorting and assembling, lies
in its unexpected transformation of ordinary, even bland, items
into objects of power, danger, wonder or warning, all with a
mysterious aura and an offbeat, lopsided charm.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilson's assemblages are very different from the works of
Joseph Cornell. They feel less literary and romantic, more
down-to-earth. However abstract Ms. Wilson's box works may appear,
they always feature recognizable elements, from earrings or watch
faces to spigots and rosary beads, that serve as familiar points of
entry to the psychologically intense zones of emotion and sensation
that her art evokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilson works unconsciously and intuitively, skillfully
arranging her objects in an allover manner suggestive of a Jackson
Pollock painting,'' Tom Hinson, curator of contemporary art and
photography at the Cleveland Museum of Art, has written. Hinson,
who has has closely followed her work and frequently put it on
display, most recently in an exhibition of art from Cleveland's
private collections.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Wilson's ``Crossways'' (1998), now on view in Hudson,
drumsticks, electric-train tracks and rusted, cross-shaped cookie
cutters come together in a near-Gothic evocation of the sacred
within the mundane. ``Montage,'' another new work, suggests wry
nostalgia and moody elegance, in a multilayered composition of
boxes within boxes. In it, there are shiny black calipers like crab
claws on the loose; odd tools peeking out of partly opened lids,
and a Japanese alphabet tile in the corner of a wire basket that
appears to be an animal's cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``La's works create meditative spaces that pull you in,'' said
Linda Mussman, a visual artist and arts administrator, on a visit
to Davis &AMP; Hall. ``You feel a sense of grace and serenity coming
from them, from who she is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mussman, a veteran theatrical director and producer, left
New York seven years ago and, with Claudia Bruce, an artist and
musician, founded Time and Space Limited, Hudson's most visible
performing arts center. Last year in the center's gallery, ``we
presented a show that looked at found objects as art, and it shook
up local audiences in a stimulating way,'' Ms. Mussman said. ``La's
work does this, too, but in a seductive, surprising way, with lots
of conflict in the signs and symbols in those meditative spaces.
She can turn an innocent clothespin into a threatening weapon.``
</P>
<P>
   Hudson is a riverside town and former whale-processing center
whose ambience reminds visitors more of Edward Hopper's edge than
Norman Rockwell's sweetness. In recent years, it has become a major
hub of the New England antiques trade and the home of many art and
antiques dealers, artists and writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, Davis &AMP; Hall does that rare thing that thrills artists
and is now almost impossible in New York's elitist art world _ it
gives them a chance to actually touch the wider, general public,''
Ms. Mussman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilson said she was ``amazed at how the process of making
these boxes, then experiencing them, has taught me to let go, to
let the materials reveal their personalities, to remain open to
possibilities.'' She added: ``Can I apply that same open-mindedness
to people? What I'm getting from the art is a spirit I want to
bring into the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if endorsing a critical notion she herself would only
modestly propose, she emphatically said: ``I get that. That fits.
That makes sense.''

IRAQ'S DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER TO VISIT TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IRAQ-US) 
(rk) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The government of Saddam Hussein scored at
least a symbolic diplomatic coup Wednesday when it was announced
that the Iraqi deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, would visit
Turkey next week.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the Foreign Ministry here said that Aziz would
arrive in Ankara on Monday for ``high-level discussions regarding
Iraq and the Turkey-Iraq relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came at a time when Iraq appeared to be
increasingly isolated. In recent weeks, Iraqi leaders have bitterly
accused many countries in the Middle East of abandoning the Iraqi
cause.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the United States has stepped up its efforts
to overthrow the Iraqi government. U.S. planes were bombing Iraq at
almost the same moment that Aziz's visit to Ankara was being
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy in Ankara, where diplomats are anxious to
prevent Iraq from driving a wedge between the United States and
Turkey, issued a restrained statement in response. It said only
that Turkey ``has its own foreign policy'' and that Turkish leaders
should ``stress to Aziz the need for Iraq to comply with U.N.
Security Council resolutions.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity, however, was
more explicit. ``We don't like it,'' the diplomat said of Aziz's
planned visit. ``Why would they give him sanction and access when
we're trying to isolate him? It runs counter to what we want to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Turkey and the United States are NATO allies and close
political partners, differences between their policies toward Iraq
have broken into the open since Bulent Ecevit became prime minister
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit, a lifelong leftist and self-proclaimed anti-imperialist,
has for years expressed sympathy with Iraq and Hussein. This month,
as U.S. war planes flying from the Incirlik base in southern Turkey
have repeatedly bombed Iraqi targets, Ecevit has begun to question
their mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iraqis are zealous supporters of their independence,''
Ecevit said during a televised interview last week. ``It is unclear
how the American government will reach its goals to overthrow
Saddam Hussein. It doesn't seem to have formed a policy on Iraq. It
needs to plan carefully what to do about that issue, and Turkey
should contribute to those plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said that Turkey remains willing to
allow U.S. planes to use the Incirlik base and wants Iraq to comply
with U.N. resolutions that require it to allow monitoring of its
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very strongly asking for full compliance,'' Cem said in
a telephone interview. ``The Americans have their policies, but
Iraq is a state and a neighbor of ours. When the leadership of a
neighboring state asks to create the groundwork for coming over and
having bilateral talks, I think it is normal to proceed with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, U.S. fighter jets based in Turkey did not respond
when Iraqi jets violated the northern no-flight zone, but allied
jets based in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait retaliated against violations
in the southern zone. A Pentagon official said there has been no
easing of enforcement in the north as a result of any unease on
Turkey's part regarding strikes from its territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to respond to Iraqi provocations in the
north,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey and Iraq enjoyed good relations before the Persian Gulf
War. Since the war, Turkey has lost billions of dollars as a result
of trade sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   A national election is scheduled here on April 18, and by
inviting Iraq's second-ranking leader to Ankara, Ecevit may be
seeking to shore up his support among leftist voters and the
thousands of families along the Iraqi border who have lost their
livelihoods as a result of the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ecevit is under intense criticism for sitting on the lap of
the United States and letting the Americans use the Incirlik base
for bombing Iraq,'' said Cengiz Candar, an author and commentator
who is a specialist on Middle Eastern politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It runs against the image he cultivated over the years as
having a distance from the United States and sympathizing with the
plight of the Iraqi people and with Saddam. On the eve of the
election campaign, he might see that as a weak spot. He may also be
hoping to use this as a bargaining chip to get more sympathy and
economic aid from Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For Tariq Aziz, the visit is important because in the
post-King Hussein era Jordan may become a base for the Iraqi
opposition, and he wants to keep Turkey from becoming another link
in that chain,'' Candar said.

DURACELL ULTRA A SUCCESS, GILLETTE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Declaring its Duracell Ultra batteries to be a major
success, Gillette Co. said Wednesday it has improved the
performance of its new line and will expand the Ultra brand into
additional alkaline battery sizes besides AA and AAA.
</P>
<P>
   Duracell also plans to add lithium batteries to the Ultra line
later this year, said David W. Young, Duracell's president.
</P>
<P>
   Rival Energizer claims to be unimpressed. In the ongoing battery
wars, Duracell is playing ``catch-up,'' trying to match advances
Energizer made months ago, said spokesman Keith Schopp.
</P>
<P>
   With its razors, Boston-based Gillette has been consistently
successful at persuading consumers to trade up to premium-priced
products that arguably offer better performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Ultra line marks an attempt by Gillette to apply the same
strategy to Duracell, which it acquired in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Introduced last year, the Ultra looks to segment the battery
market into two categories: the standard Duracell and the Ultra,
which is specially designed for high-drain devices such as digital
cameras and palm-sized computers. Ultra batteries cost about 20
percent more than the standard Duracell line.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics scoffed at the idea of a premium-battery line, and some
cite a Consumer Reports study that said batteries are a commodity
and advised consumers to buy batteries based on price rather than
on hard-to-prove claims of longevity.
</P>
<P>
   But Duracell points to recent sales figures as proof that its
strategy of offering a premium battery line is working.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Duracell said its batteries surpassed the
50-percent mark of US dollar sales and now enjoy a ``19
percentage-point share gap'' over Energizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duracell is clearly the market leader,'' said Tony Vento, an
analyst with Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to widen its US lead, Duracell said it will spend $140
million to advertise and promote the Ultra brand as Ultra batteries
in C, D, and 9-volt sizes come onto the market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Energizer's parent, pet food giant Ralston Purina Co.
of St. Louis, suggested last month that quarterly profits failed to
meet expectations because of lower battery sales.
</P>
<P>
   A third company, Rayovac Corp., seems intent on positioning
itself as a lower-price alternative to Duracell and Energizer.
</P>
<P>
   While Duracell Ultra has enjoyed early success in the United
States, Canada, and Western Europe, it is still unclear whether
consumers in economically ailing parts of Asia and Latin America
will want to pay a higher price for a premium battery.

<P>
   Homeowners are often confused when they read how-to books on
home improvement. The following glossary contains the most common
terms used in general house construction and should help the
do-it-yourselfer understand builder's jargon:
</P>
<P>
   ANCHOR BOLTS: Bolts that hold the sill plate to the foundation
wall.
</P>
<P>
   BEARING WALL: A wall that supports a load, like a floor or roof.
Generally a bearing wall runs at right angles to the joists above.
</P>
<P>
   BRACE: A piece of lumber nailed diagonally across framing
members.
</P>
<P>
   CRIPPLE STUDS: Short studs that run from the sole plate to the
sill plate under a window opening.
</P>
<P>
   DRYWALL: Also called wallboard. Panels, made of gypsum plaster
sandwiched between construction paper; usually 4 feet by 6 feet.
Thickness varies from 1/ 4 to 5/8-inch in 1/8-inch increments.
Drywall is used to cover the framing to create a smooth flat wall
or ceiling surface.
</P>
<P>
   EAVE: The lower part of the roof that extends past the wall.
</P>
<P>
   FIRESTOPS: Thick pieces or wood or noncombustible material
strategically placed within wall or ceiling cavities. They stop the
flue action in these cavities and help keep fires from spreading
through a burning building.
</P>
<P>
   FOOTING: A course of concrete, rectangular in section, placed at
the bottom of a foundation or pier. It is wider than the foundation
or pier and helps to support it by distributing the load into the
surrounding earth.
</P>
<P>
   FROSTLINE: An imaginary line in the soil that indicates the
depth of frost penetration in the soil. As the soil freezes and
thaws, it will expand and contract. Footings placed below the frost
line will be stable because they will not be affected the
freeze-thaw cycle. The frost line varies throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   GRADE: The ground level around a structure. Natural grade is the
original level before construction. Finished grade is the ground
level after leveling operations are done.
</P>
<P>
   HEADER: In window or door openings, the header is a horizontal
member perpendicular to the studs. It forms the lintel above the
opening. A header joist is a beam placed perpendicular to the
joists.
</P>
<P>
   JOISTS: Horizontal beams that support the floor. Joists are
parallel to each other and usually spaced 16 inches apart on
center. In some cases, where more support is required, the joists
may be closer together.
</P>
<P>
   LOAD: A weight that bears down on a structural member.
Architects recognize two types of loads: dead loads, which consist
of the weight of the structure, including the walls, floors, roof,
etc., and live loads, which consist of appliances, furniture and
people.
</P>
<P>
   ON CENTER: Measurement made from the center of one structural
member to the center of the other. Studs, joists and rafters are
usually spaced 16 inches apart on center.
</P>
<P>
   PLATE: A horizontal structural member that runs across the top
of the wall. The joists rest on the top plate. The sole plate runs
along the bottom, forming the base for the studs. The vertical
studs rise between the two plates.
</P>
<P>
   RAFTER: The primary structural members of a gable roof. The
rafters rise at an angle from the walls and joint to the ridge
board at the peak.
</P>
<P>
   SOFFITS: The underside of the eaves.
</P>
<P>
   SHEATHING: Material that covers the framing. Modern houses
usually have sheathing of plywood, particle board or outdoor
drywall panels.
</P>
<P>
   SILL: A horizontal piece of lumber fastened to the top of the
foundation wall with anchor bolts. It transfers the weight of the
house to the foundation. The term sill may also refer to the
horizontal member that forms the bottom piece of a window frame.
</P>
<P>
   SPAN: The distance between columns, posts or walls.
</P>
<P>
   SUBFLOOR: Boards or panels laid directly on the floor joists.
The subfloor serves as the base or substrate for finished flooring.
</P>
<P>
   STUDS: The vertical framing members that support a wall. Studs
are generally made of 2-by-4s spaced 16 inches apart on center. In
northern climates, where more insulation is required, the outside
walls have wider 2-by-6s for studs.
</P>
<P>
   TOENAILING: Driving a nail at an angle so that it penetrates
through one piece into another. This technique differs from direct,
or face, nailing, where the nail is driven perpendicular to the
surface of the top board so it penetrates into the board behind.

BRITAIN MOVES TO SPUR WELFARE RECIPIENTS TO SEEK WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a new effort to attack what he called the
``something-for-nothing welfare state,'' Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Wednesday introduced legislation that would require most of
Britain's welfare recipients to attend regular interviews to
discuss job opportunities. People who failed to comply, he said,
would lose their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is one in a series of measures that Blair's Labor
government has taken in the last year and a half to reduce
Britain's $157 billion-a-year social welfare bill and to encourage
the country's welfare recipients to look for work. While it does
not threaten most people with the loss of benefits if they fail or
refuse to find jobs, the prime minister said, it does require that
they make a determined effort to enter the job market.
</P>
<P>
   The government's bill, which is to be voted on by Parliament
later this year, also attacks the country's program of providing
so-called incapacity benefits to people with long-term illnesses,
which Blair says has ``drifted out of control'' as more and more
people use it as an excuse to take early retirement and never seek
work again. Tightening the requirements for the program and
reducing payments to some recipients could result in about 170,000
people losing their benefits for a savings of some $1.2 billion a
year, according to advocates for welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said that the welfare state under New Labor _ as the Labor
Party calls itself in an effort to distance itself from past
left-wing governments _ should be based on ``a new ethic of rights
and responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   His previous welfare reform programs, known collectively as the
New Deal, have been criticized for not going far enough toward
ending the culture of dependency. The proposals introduced
Wednesday seemed intended to address some of that criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individuals have a responsibility to accept work, train
themselves for jobs, be flexible in the jobs they take and avoid
dependency where they can,'' the prime minister said in an article
in The Daily Mail on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Parliament on Wednesday afternoon, Social Security
Secretary Alistair Darling said that the new interviews _ which
would be scheduled periodically for people receiving benefits _
would require welfare recipients to discuss their reasons for not
working and help them explore ways of finding work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we will not do is simply rot away and live a life on
benefit,'' he said. ``There comes a point where it's not good for
you and not good for the rest of us to be unemployed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some groups of recipients, including the terminally ill and
people with severe mental handicaps, would be exempt from the
interviews, he said. ``But for those people who can work,'' he
said, ``the message is quite clear _ that they should work and
there is no excuse for not doing so.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's proposals join earlier efforts by the government to
urge welfare recipients to find jobs. Under previous legislation,
people who receive unemployment benefits are now required to accept
reasonable offers of work, or lose their benefits. And under the
so-called New Deal, which gives employers incentives to hire the
unemployed, more than 100,000 people aged 18 to 24 have found work,
the government says.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's proposals were immediately attacked from both
the left and the right. The Conservative Party accused the
government of ``talking tough'' but not ``acting tough'' and said
that the new plan would not work unless more jobs were created.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Parliament on Labor's left wing said that the
government's plan of compulsory interviews would be particularly
difficult for vulnerable welfare recipients like the mentally ill
or people seeking single-parent benefits for the first time.
``People fear this kind of harassment will be oppressive to
people,'' said Lynne Jones, a Labor member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   And advocates for welfare recipients accused the government of
using overheated language in order to pander to middle-income
people who are not traditional Labor supporters but who voted for
the Labor Party in the last general election. It was no
coincidence, they said, that Blair announced his new proposals in
The Daily Mail, a popular, conservative tabloid whose support for
him tends to run hot and cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Blair's statement that he wanted to end the
`something-for-nothing' welfare state is offensive, because it
implies that people get benefits as a matter of course,'' said
Martin Barnes, the director of the Child Poverty Action Group, an
advocacy group for low-income families. ``This is not true _ there
are means tests, medical examinations, lots of forms to fill out _
and it reinforces negative stereotypes about the benefits system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really disappointed that this is coming from a Labor
government,'' Barnes continued. ``There is an element of trying to
outdo the Conservative Party on rhetoric.''

COMMENTARY: A BREWING STORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The woman stood outside the tiny vestibule on Wheeler
Avenue in the Bronx where Amadou Diallo had been killed in an
astonishing barrage of gunfire unleashed by four undercover cops. A
cold wind was blowing down the quiet street. Candles flickered on
the floor of the unlocked vestibule. Flowers had also been placed
on the floor. The woman made the sign of the cross and then wiped
tears from her face. But she couldn't stop crying.
</P>
<P>
   I was standing a few feet away with a notebook and a pen. The
woman turned to me, still wiping her eyes, and said, ``For the
first time in my life I feel hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, at a rally in Foley Square in lower Manhattan, a
brokerage house employee named Gordon Andrews said: ``This
(expletive) has got to stop. They are killing us and nobody is
hearing us.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer from Brooklyn who stood on the steps of the state
Supreme Court building to watch the rally told me: ``There's a
storm brewing, and it's a big one. People are fed up. I'm fed up.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if Mayor Rudolph Giuliani realizes it, but there
are limits to the amount of abuse that black New Yorkers will
accept from violent and racist police officers. And those limits
are fast approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Black New Yorkers are in a fury over the cold-blooded killing of
Diallo. His death is seen by most blacks as simply the latest
tragic manifestation of the ruthless and humiliating treatment of
ethnic minorities that is part of the daily routine of so many cops
in this city.
</P>
<P>
   Apologists for the Police Department can try to sugar-coat it if
they like. Yes, it's true that crime has dropped precipitously.
Yes, it's true that most cops are solid citizens. But it is also
true that there is a frightening number of violent, racist,
sadistic and in some cases homicidal police officers who spend much
of their time terrorizing people. And that behavior is widely seen
by black New Yorkers as being tolerated if not condoned by
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   How gruesome has the situation become? Some parents and civic
leaders are teaching black and Hispanic children to quickly display
their hands during any encounter with police, like little
criminals. This is to show that the youngsters are not armed and
therefore should not be blown into eternity at age 10 or 15 or 20
by a trigger-happy stranger in a blue uniform.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a long epidemic of outrages _ killings, the
torturing of Abner Louima, the invasions by rampaging cops of the
apartments of innocent families, the routine beating and harassment
of young men and boys, the curses and the racial slurs, the arrests
on phony charges of individuals who dare to object to abusive
treatment, and more.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer the mayor ordered an entire section of Harlem locked
down because he objected to a rally that was being held.
</P>
<P>
   There is a widespread feeling among black New Yorkers that they
are living in a police state, and that many of the cops are a
threat to the very lives of their children. The anger and
resentment over this is growing by the day. And increasingly the
resentment is being directed not just toward police and the mayor
but toward white New Yorkers in general, who are not subjected to
the same levels of brutality and harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am scared to death,'' said a former city official, who asked
not to be identified, ``that this division between blacks and
whites, this schism, is growing so large that it can't be repaired.
African-Americans perceive that the white community largely
condones Rudy's policies as they relate to the blacks and the
police. And therefore the whites are as much to blame as Rudy and
the police.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe that most white New Yorkers condone police
misconduct, but there have not been nearly enough white voices
raised against the atrocities committed by police. This unfortunate
silence is, indeed, a form of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   The cops who killed Amadou Diallo have had several days now to
craft their story. The mayor and the police commissioner are doing
their public-relations thing, offering condolences, ordering
meaningless training, waiting for the press to turn its attention
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, black New Yorkers are seething. (BOX)

SEX PERVADES TELEVISION, BUT LET'S NOT BECOME EUNUCHES OVER IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sex is good. They say that's how I got here.
</P>
<P>
   But I admit I feel uncomfortable when every other joke on some
sitcoms is a sex joke, or when every other comedy ``situation''
involves a coupling, an attempted coupling or a thwarted coupling.
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for dramas. That doesn't make me a bluenose as much as
it makes me someone who sees a lot of bad TV.
</P>
<P>
   But I like it even less when someone tries to mandate what TV
ought to be doing. It appears The Kaiser Family Foundation did that
this week by releasing a study of sexual content on TV. To no one's
surprise, the study found that more than half (56 percent) of some
1,300 programs studied during the 1997-98 season contained sexual
content, including 85 percent of soap operas, 83 percent of movies,
78 percent of talk shows, 58 percent of dramas and newsmagazines,
and 56 percent of sitcoms. Useful information, but the foundation
went farther, suggesting that many shows were irresponsibly
offering no information on the risks and responsibilities of sexual
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Altman, president of the foundation, said, ``Surveys tell
us that young people get a lot of their information and ideas about
sex from TV. With the problems facing adolescents today, how sex is
shown on TV is just as important as how much sex is shown on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   One would naturally extrapolate that, every time a scene shows a
person getting into a car, The Kaiser Family Foundation will
request a responsible demonstration on seat-belt use. Similar
script advisories would accompany scenes of cigarette smoking,
cursing, jaywalking and any other real-world activities we don't
want our kids to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, an episode of ``Felicity'' dealt reasonably
well with the issue of first-time sex. In it, Felicity (Keri
Russell) was trying to schedule her first sexual encounter as if it
were a dinner date or a dorm party. She eventually saw the folly in
that, and never did have sex. Still, a friend of mine forbade his
two teenage daughters to watch the show, basing his decision on The
WB's commercials, which were titillating, and entirely misleading.
He made a straightforward _ and unpopular _ parenting call that The
Kaiser Family Foundation wants the TV networks to make.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the foundation should be looking at the commercials.
Better yet, as a philanthropic group interested in the public's
well-being, maybe it should be aiming its studies not at the
creative process but at the nurturing process.
</P>
<P>
   Believe me. I like responsible programming, but I cherish
creative freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Odds 'n' ends
</P>
<P>
   Sorry to keep harping on sex, but the Rev. Jerry Falwell started
it. He worries that one of the ``Teletubbies'' is overtly
homosexual. Seems Tinky-Winky carries a purse and has an antenna in
the shape of a triangle, the symbol of gay pride. If the good
reverend has that much time on his hands, perhaps he could check
out the antenna on Dipsy's head. Suspiciously erect, no? I suspect
it would indicate the alpha male of this kinky group. And that
circular thing on Po's head would seem to fit nicely around Dipsy's
doodle. Could an international sex scandal (``Teletubbies'' is made
by a British company) be brewing on PBS! And what's up with
Laa-Laa's corkscrew. Bisexual? Wino? Walked into the door of a
leather bar looking for Tinky-Winky? We'll keep you posted.
</P>
<P>
   Short-timer George Clooney begins heading for the exit in
earnest Thursday night tonight when ``ER'' begins a two-parter

goes from hot water to rolling boil for his flouting of hospital
rules. The good news: Ross doesn't die, leaving him available for
an occasional visit to County General in future seasons. Clooney
will make his last appearance as a regular cast member next week.

PATRIOTS DEAL TO BE SIGNED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The New England Patriots stadium development agreement
is expected to be completed Thursday in much the same way the deal
was speedily put together: quietly and behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   And while reports surfaced in the past week about newly realized
problems associated with the $374 million Hartford project _
including site, tax, and public works issues _ Connecticut Governor
John G. Rowland has virtually gone underground on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   His last major appearance on the stadium was a public relations
repair job a week ago when he announced inside the Capitol that the
final development agreement signing would have to be postponed for
a second time.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, lawyers have worked arduously on the more than
250-page document to build in protection for team owner Robert
Kraft in case the state cannot deliver on its promise for a clear
site _ now occupied by a steam plant _ in time for the Patriots to
move to Hartford by 2002, at the latest.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland's press office, openly annoyed at the Boston media,
imposed a blackout for a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we talk to the Boston press it comes out wrong,''
said Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani. ``We've already announced that
the development agreement is done except for the signing.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the governor is merely trying to control the
process just as he did at the start, and stifle any dissent on the
complex project after fast-tracking the legislation through the
General Assembly in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an understatement,'' said Senator John Fonfara, a
Democrat from Hartford. ``We've written a letter asking the
governor to see (key provisions of the development agreement)
before it's signed and we've never heard back regarding that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonfara, and the rest of the Hartford delegation, signed the
missive last week pressing to know if the agreement will force
Kraft to make payments in lieu of taxes on the stadium site and
whether local companies would receive construction job guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Neither issue, he said, was addressed in the initial agreement
Kraft and Rowland signed in November. Nor was it included in the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some estimates say the city will have to pay more than
$2 million a year to provide police details and other security
around the construction site.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Hartford representatives have not heard back from
Rowland's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be ignored like this,'' Fonfara huffed. ``The whole thing
has been underground.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartford collects $2.1 million a year on the land that would be
used for the 68,000-seat open-air facility. However, it appears
that the Patriots would neither pay property taxes on the site nor
make payments in lieu of taxes. The team would be assessed taxes on
a hotel Kraft must build next to the stadium. But that land is not
currently assessed by the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get about $2 million in taxes on that
development,'' Nilda Torres, a spokeswoman for Hartford Mayor
Michael Peters, said referring to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Torres said Kraft will be responsible for paying any police and
security details on the stadium property, while the city would pick
up the tab for officers on the streets surrounding the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to be that much of an increase or
that much of a problem,'' Torres said. ``The mayor and the (City)
Council feel comfortable with the picture. . . The points that were
a problem are on the road to being resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``It's pretty much the governor's project.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, CTG Resources Inc., owner of the steam plant, has not
acted on an offer by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority,
a quasi-public power agency trying to buy the company, allowing the
land to be cleared for the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The steam plant,'' Pagani said, ``has not been resolved yet.''

A HOLIDAY SINCE SLAVERY

<P>
   The holiday called Juneteenth dates back to June 19, 1865, when
Union forces sailed into Galveston Bay, established control of
Texas and enforced the emancipation of the slaves that had taken
effect, if only symbolically, in 1863 with the Emancipation
Proclamation issued by President Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years the holiday has become something of a metaphor
for the vagaries of memory.
</P>
<P>
   It was celebrated by the former slaves, who took the name from a
colloquial rendering of the date. For decades it was essentially a
local observance by blacks in Texas and to a lesser extent in other
states west of the Mississippi, particularly Oklahoma, where Ralph
Ellison grew up.
</P>
<P>
   During segregation, the day was marked by celebrations in black
neighborhoods. In Houston, whites-only rules were suspended at
parks and fairgrounds for the day.
</P>
<P>
   But even in Texas, Juneteenth celebrations began to wane after
World War II and the day declined in importance as the last
survivors of the era of slavery died. But then, with the Civil
Rights era and the growth of black political power in the South,
interest in the holiday increased again. A black state
representative from Houston, Al Edwards, proposed in 1979 that it
be made an official state holiday, and the proposal was
overwhelmingly adopted by the Texas Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Juneteenth has gained visibility outside Texas. When
some blacks called for a ``Day of Absence'' in 1992, asking blacks
to boycott schools, shops and workplaces to protest the not-guilty
verdict in the Rodney King beating case, Juneteenth was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   There are occasional parades and observances east of the
Mississippi. But the holiday remains most vital in Texas and to a
lesser extent other Western states like Arizona and California.

SCIENTISTS DUPLICATE CANCER DRUG'S PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After several worrisome setbacks in efforts to duplicate
dramatic tumor-shrinking experiments with anti-cancer drugs
discovered by Boston researcher Judah Folkman, government
scientists who journeyed to his laboratory say they have been able
to reproduce his results.
</P>
<P>
   The successful mouse experiments by scientists from the National
Cancer Institute means that the countdown is under way toward the
first human trials of the drug endostatin, said Dr. Robert Wittes,
deputy director of the NCI, Wednesday. The NCI researchers came to
Boston's Children's Hospital to master the technical difficulties
of working with the drug after they failed last fall in their first
attempts to reproduce his stunning 1997 results in tumor-ridden
mice.
</P>
<P>
   Wittes said he couldn't predict when human tests of the drug
would start, but the cancer institute this week sent out notices to
medical centers around the country inviting proposals for Phase I
trials, the small initial human tests designed to find out if a
drug is safe.
</P>
<P>
   The word came one day after pharmaceutical giant Bristol Meyers
Squibb announced it was pulling out of a partnership designed to
develop angiostatin, a related anti-cancer drug that also came out
of Folkman's work to block tumors from developing the blood supply
the need to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Endostatin and a number of similarly-acting drugs called
angiogenesis inhibitors have been in the spotlight Folkman's lab
showed in animal tests that they could shrink large tumors into a
dormant state, with few apparent side effects.
</P>
<P>
   When the NCI scientists said last fall they could not match
Folkman's achievement using a small quantity of the drug sent from
his laboratory, Folkman said it was not surprising because the drug
is so sensitive to handling, storage and the way it's administered.
The NCI then sent researchers to Folkman's lab in November and
December to learn first-hand the subtleties of working with
endostatin.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday Wittes, deputy NCI director for extramural research,
said the researchers, working with endostatin made by Folkman's
scientists and performing the experiments in Folkman's lab, had
achieved the same shrinkage of mouse tumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This substantiates the idea that these are technical issues''
that caused the initial failures of the drug to work at NCI, ``Now
we will move to NCI facilities in Frederick (Md.) and try to
reproduce the results down here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Endostatin is the most powerful to date of a number of
angiogenesis inhibitors discovered in the laboratory headed by
Folkman, who has pursued for 30 years the notion that the body
produces substances that can combat tumors by cutting off their
life-support system of tiny blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Used together in experiments at Children's Hospital, endostatin
and the similar but less-potent angiostatin have been able to
shrink tumors until they all but vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Children's Hospital licensed both drugs to EntreMed, a small
Maryland biotech company, for further development into commercial
products. EntreMed in turn sublicensed angiostatin to Bristol Myers
Squibb, while EntreMed and the National Cancer Institute
concentrated on endostatin.
</P>
<P>
   However, the future of angiostatin was clouded by Bristol Myers'
announcement Tuesday that it was abandoning the time-consuming and
costly project because it hadn't yielded a consistently effective
drug. Angiostatin, in chemical terms, is an extremely large protein
molecule that is difficult to synthesize.
</P>
<P>
   ``This molecule is very complex and presents an array of
challenges,'' said Peggy Ballman, a Bristol Myers spokeswoman.
``Some batches would be active at a certain level and some would
not. We didn't have the information we needed to advance it'' into
a stage ready for human trials.
</P>
<P>
   The Bristol Myers decision means that EntreMed is now free to
develop angiostatin on its own, though analysts doubted whether the
company, whose stock dropped 47 percent Wednesday to 12 7/8 on the
news, had the resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Bristol pulled out makes it that much more
difficult to develop'' both angiostatin and endostatin at the same
time, said Dr. Eric Ende, an analyst at Lehman Brothers in New
York. EntreMed officials did not immediately return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setback for angiostatin, scientists working with
angiogenesis inhibitors remained upbeat on the future of the drugs.
Dr. Vikas P. Sukhatme, chief of nephrology (kidney diseases) at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said it was not
suprising that angiostatin was proving difficult to make.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his colleagues are concentrating on endostatin,
which seems to be more powerful. They reported last month that
endostatin halted the growth of kidney tumors in mice, and in high
doses even caused some of those tumors to shrink, further
confirmation that Folkman's results were not a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very optimistic,'' said Sukhatme. ``I think in the next
six months to a year we'll learn what pathways in cells these drugs
(angiogenesis inhibitors) affect, and we can start thinking of how
to rationally combine them'' as cancer treatments.

TEXAS PRISON OFFICIAL TESTIFIES TO IMPROVED CONDITIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A state prison administrator testified Wednesday
that Texas penitentiaries have vastly improved since the dark days
of the 1970s, and officials have no desire to backslide to the era
of widespread inhumane conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Janie Cockrell, deputy director for security, told senior U.S.
District Judge William Wayne Justice that she's witnessed a variety
of modernizations since she began prison work in 1976. Her career
started four years after inmate David Ruiz filed a class-action
lawsuit that led to dramatic changes _ ordered by Justice _
beginning in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Cockrell, one of the last witnesses in a three-week hearing over
alleged constitutional violations, said the improvements include
better guard training; wiser use of force and attention to inmates'
medical needs. Gone are the days of hellish overcrowding, when
inmates guarded their own cellblocks, violence reigned and other
unconstitutional conditions prevailed, she indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no comparison. It has been a tremendous change for
good. I can tell you not a one wants to go back to those days,''
Cockrell said.
</P>
<P>
   However, an inmate-hired expert rebutted Cockrell's claims,
saying uses of force are not thoroughly investigated and are rarely
deemed excessive. They also seldom result in penalties for guards,
said Allen Breed, former director of the National Institute of
Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Breed also testified that prison officials probably ``grossly
understate'' the estimated 8,000 annual uses of force _ twice the
number in similarly sized California.
</P>
<P>
   Documented use-of-force injuries included broken jaws and other
bones; cuts requiring stitches and eye injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Cockrell, who rose through ranks to become the state's first
female warden in 1990, had contradicted earlier testimony from
inmates and their expert witnesses alleging a pattern of excessive
use of force. Cockrell described force as a last resort and said
the number of reported incidents _ some as minor as incidental
touching _ dropped 28 percent from 1994-98.
</P>
<P>
   She attributed the decline to better guard training and
regional-level monitoring to verify whether force was necessary.
Disciplinary and medical reports are cross-checked for consistency,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, injuries remain common in use of force incidents. Of 589
system-wide incidents reported in February 1998, 375 had no
injuries; 204 involved injuries and 10 were invalid, Cockrell said,
adding that the rate spikes upward in summer months.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's hot, people tend to get agitated and frustrated,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why officials last summer added fans and water coolers;
allowed inmates to wear shorts in more areas; adjusted bus
schedules; and limited the heat exposure of inmates taking certain
drugs, Cockrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Breed said he measured temperatures in excess of 100
degrees in some women's units, where he also said inmates appeared
to be kept in leg irons _ unconstitutionally _ for punitive, not
security, reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Cockrell also had responded to numerous inmates' claims that
they were sexually assaulted but their complaints rarely resulted
in penalties for their inmate attackers. Cockrell said the message
is clear that rape ``won't be tolerated and we will hold offenders
accountable.'' However, she acknowledged that of the 81 sexual
assaults alleged in 1997, only seven were verified and resulted in
sanctions against attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Inmate witnesses last month described being repeatedly raped;
and having to pay for protection by using commissary credits. Some
prisoners claimed their formal complaints and requests for
safekeeping were ignored, allowing retaliation and more assaults.
Breed said a lack of safekeeping cells was a cause for the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   A prison captain had testified Tuesday that sexual assaults
often are difficult to verify, and many are deemed consensual when
the victim ``doesn't even attempt to defend himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The rate of sexual assault has declined, Cockrell said, in large
part due to a 1995 law that causes inmates to forfeit good-conduct
time credits and lose privileges if they are found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, some amount of inmate aggression is inevitable,
Cockrell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they victimize because they're mad at them _ or
they're just perverts,'' she said. ``There's all kinds of reasons
why they victimize each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Testimony before Justice is expected to concludeThursday. After
final arguments, Justice will decide by March 1 whether on-going
constitutional violations warrant his continued supervision of the
140,000-inmate Texas Department of Criminal Justice-Institutional
Division.

BAY STATE OFFICIAL SEEKS TO BOOST REGIONAL PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Secretary of State William F. Galvin flies to
Washington Thursday as a man on a mission: To transform the chaotic
demolition derby the presidential primary season has become into an
orderly system of rotating regional contests.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, Galvin hopes to have won the imprimatur of the
National Association of Secretaries of State, which would give the
regional primary proposal a big boost, and kick off a nationwide
effort to make it a reality.
</P>
<P>
   The current system now has so many big primaries so close
together that it has become a front-loaded contest that is over
almost before it begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have moved to the Big Bang theory of presidential
selection, which rewards high name recognition or a lot of money or
both,'' said Galvin.
</P>
<P>
   How rushed is the current schedule? The Iowa caucuses, the first
contest in the nominating process, comes on Feb. 7, 2000; the New
Hampshire primary will follow within several weeks. ``Then, by the
end of March, 75 percent of the delegates will have been
selected,'' Galvin said. ``Most likely, the nominees of both
parties will be known by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Some think the primary campaigns will effectively end even
earlier, after March 7, when New York, the New England states,
California, Maryland, Washington, and probably New Jersey and
Oregon, will go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   That is a big change over the traditional system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, on the Democratic side, for example, George McGovern
did not wrap up the nomination until he beat Hubert Humphrey in
California on June 6; in 1976, challengers chased Jimmy Carter
until his victory in Ohio on June 8; in 1984, Walter Mondale
battled Gary Hart to the last June primaries and beyond to win the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But since then the process has yielded de facto nominees much
earlier. In 1988, Michael S. Dukakis was the inevitable winner once
he beat Al Gore and Jesse Jackson in New York's April 19 primary;
similarly, in 1992, Bill Clinton had the nomination in his grasp
once he defeated Jerry Brown in New York on April 7.
</P>
<P>
   Even in those years, however, the relatively staggered
primaries, occurring over several months, gave lesser-known
candidates a chance to emerge, and ensured that the frontrunner
would be examined and tested week by week.
</P>
<P>
   Such a marathon has its advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something about a longer process, moving from state
to state, dealing with wins and losses and adversity, that tests
your mettle and your ability to lead,'' said John Sasso, who
masterminded Dukakis's 1988 presidential campaign. ``That may be
missing this time, where it could be over, with the frontloading,
after the results are in on March 7.''
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the National Association of Secretaries of
State's Committee on Presidential Primaries, Galvin, who in 1995
helped make the early March Yankee regional primary a reality, is
pushing a plan to change that.
</P>
<P>
   It will not happen by 2000, but Galvin has big hopes for 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal put forward by Galvin and committee vice
chairman Bill Jones, California's secretary of state, Iowa and New
Hampshire would retain their position at the start of the process,
since they are small states that favor face-to-face campaigning and
give dark horses a chance to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the country would be divided into four zones, the
West, the Midwest, the South, and the Northeast. Each region would
have a separate date for its primary contests. After one regional
vote, candidates would have a month to campaign in the next region
before its states hold primaries.
</P>
<P>
   The regions would rotate each presidential election, with the
area that was first moving to the end of the line for the next
election.
</P>
<P>
   That plan, Galvin says, would restore time and balance to the
nominating process, giving candidates a better chance to make their
case, and the voters an opportunity to evaluate the candidates over
time.
</P>
<P>
   Because a significant portion of delegates would remain unchosen
until the final regional primary, states would be less likely to
see their contests rendered moot because the nomination had already
been decided.
</P>
<P>
   That is why California moved from June to early March. It was
that move, in turn, that has helped galvanize sentiment for a
regional system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was something that was talked about every four years and
then forgotten,'' said Jones, the California secretary of state.
``California's moving early pushed this rotation regional primary
system to the fore, and properly so.''
</P>
<P>
   With the association in Washington for its winter meeting,
Galvin and Jones expect the secretaries of state _ who, after all,
are the top election officials in each state _ will approve the
plan handily. Then each secretary of state has to carry the idea
back to his home state, where it would need legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   To build support, the association has pushed its proposal with
bipartisan organizations like the Council of State Governments and
the National Governors Association, as well as with both national
political parties.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not everyone is a fan. Outgoing Democratic National
Committee Chairman Steven Grossman worries such a system will give
regional candidates an unfair boost in years when their areas vote
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a candidate from the Midwest emerges and does very well in
a Midwestern primary, it gives that person an unfair advantage over
anybody else,'' Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No system is perfect,'' Galvin said. ``But considering how bad
things are now, this would be a huge improvement over the current
system, which is the worst of all worlds.''

READING TEST SCORES HAILED FOR STOPPING THE SLIDE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration Wednesday reported
modest gains in student performance on reading tests, but said they
were significant because the increase reversed a downturn that
occurred in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gains are not huge, but they are statistically
significant,'' said Vice President Al Gore, who went to the
Education Department to announce results of the survey, the
National Assessment of Educational Progress, a widely used
yardstick of academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   The government reported test results for 31,000 children in the
fourth, eighth and 12th grades. At all grade levels, scores were
higher in 1998 than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But many children were just making up ground lost early in the
decade, when reading scores declined for reasons that were not
clear. The performance of fourth-graders and 12th-graders was about
the same in 1998 as in 1992. Only eighth-graders scored higher in
1998 than in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard Riley said: ``We were on a downward
trend. Over the last four years, we have changed that trend and
moved upward.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the latest gains, most students were still reading below
the levels recommended by the governing board of the testing
program.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Feinberg, assistant director of the National Assessment
Governing Board, an independent bipartisan body that sets standards
for the tests, said: ``On a few occasions in the past, there have
been gains this large or slightly larger for particular age groups.
But this is the first time there have been statistically
significant increases in all three grades since the program began
testing reading skills in 1971.''
</P>
<P>
   A change is said to be statistically significant if there is a
high probability that it is real, not a result of a statistical
aberration.
</P>
<P>
   The government also pays for tests in mathematics, science,
history, geography and other fields. The results are usually
announced at a news conference. The event Wednesday, with Gore in
attendance, was more political than usual. Dozens of education
lobbyists attended the event, held in an auditorium at the
Education Department. The difference in tone was noted by the
collectors of education statistics, who pride themselves on being
nonpolitical.
</P>
<P>
   The governing board defines three levels of reading achievement:
basic, proficient and advanced. Only one-third of fourth-graders
and eighth-graders were deemed to be at least proficient, meaning
that they could understand a text and draw inferences from it.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one percent of 12th-graders were at or above the
``proficient'' level of achievement. But education experts note
that some of the poorest students have dropped out of school by the
12th grade, and dropouts are not tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's encouraging that scores have gone up,'' said Catherine
Snow, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education who
led a study of children's reading problems for the National Academy
of Sciences. ``But my glee is somewhat muted. I'd like to see a
more rapid rise in scores for black and Latino kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Tests are graded on a scale from 0 to 500. The average score for
all eighth-graders was 260 in 1994, the same as in 1992, but it
rose to 264 in 1998. For black eighth-graders, the average scores
were 238 in 1992, 237 in 1994 and 243 in 1998. For Hispanic
eighth-graders, the scores were 241, 240 and 244, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The average score for fourth-graders of all races rose 3 points
in the last four years, to 217, with most of the improvement
occurring among poor readers. The average score for 12th-graders
rose 4 points, to 291, with most of the gains observed among
students in the middle and at the top of the class.
</P>
<P>
   Among 12th-graders, the government said, there was ``no apparent
difference between 1998 and 1992 in overall average scores for the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls scored better than boys at all grade levels. And scores
for public school students were, on average, lower than the scores
for children in the same grades at private schools. But average
reading scores for eighth-graders and 12th-graders at public
schools did show an increase from 1994 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, known as the nation's report card, found a widening
gap between good readers and poor readers at the 12th-grade level.
From 1992 to 1998, scores declined for the lowest 10th of the
senior class, but rose for the top-performing 10th of the class.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Federal education officials said they were pleased to see a
decline in the amount of time students spent watching television.
Not surprisingly, students who watched less television scored
higher on reading tests. Still, more than one-third of
eighth-graders and nearly a fourth of 12th-graders said they
watched at least four hours of television a day.
</P>
<P>
   The government strongly implied that watching too much
television was bad for children because it induced passivity and
took time from ``activities that contribute to literacy
development.'' But Dennis Wharton, senior vice president of the
National Association of Broadcasters, said, ``We don't have any
information suggesting that children who watch TV are less literate
than those who don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the test results showed that Congress should approve
``the Clinton-Gore education agenda,'' including $392 million to
reduce class size, tutor children and help those with reading
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bill Goodling, a former schoolteacher who is chairman
of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, disagreed.
Billions of dollars spent on remedial education and federal
literacy programs have ``led to nothing but mediocrity and more
education bureaucracy,'' said Goodling, R-Pa.

<P>
   Size has always mattered to Robert Halmi Sr., way before the
catch phrase became less a term of sexual bravado and more a matter
of cheesy film promotion plastered on the sides of city buses.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran producer with a reputation for making miniseries
magic, myth and money, Halmi is responsible for turning Ted Danson
into a towering giant in ``Gulliver's Travels'' and populating
``Merlin'' with a fanciful talking mountain, magical horses and
assorted fairies, demons and dragons.
</P>
<P>
   But the massive ``Cleopatra'' may be the mother of all Halmi
miniseries. Shot in Morocco and England over five months, the epic
saga made use of 13,000 extras, 7,000 horses, 300 camels and 1,500
pieces of jewelry in a production that, at last check, was coming
in at $30 million and change.
</P>
<P>
   With Timothy Dalton as Julius Caesar, Billy Zane as Marc Antony
and French-Chilean newcomer Leonor Varela as the Queen of the Nile,
ABC already is positioning the four-hour production as a sure-shot
ratings streamroller for the May sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   That would be some achievement, given the current scramble to
produce similar lavishly staged megamovies in which exotic locales
are a given, big-name stars a must, and budgets akin to those of
the heydays of the late '70s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, the most aggressive of the networks, kicked off the week
with a four-hour dramatization of ``The '60s,'' complete with
newsreel footage and era songs for which the airing rights cost a
small fortune. NBC has scheduled for Feb. 28 a three-hour
adaptation of Alice in Wonderland; on Feb. 14 and 15, ABC unveils
Stephen King's four-hour ``Storm of the Century,'' which spent $12
million on special effects and set construction alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noah's Ark'' airs in May on NBC with Academy Award winner F.
Murray Abraham, Jon Voight and Mary Steenburgen. The same month,
expect ``Atomic Train,'' a disaster-suspense epic whose special
effects will most likely get top billing over star Rob Lowe. CBS'
hopes fall on ``Joan of Arc,'' which is filming in Prague and said
to be costing up to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   In production for November is another Halmi miniseries,
``Arabian Nights,'' for ABC. Airing the same month is Aftershock, a
CBS release about an earthquake that wipes out New York City.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the excessive spending here, consider that less
than $3 million is the top-end budget for a typical two-hour TV
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Budgets are soaring because, in true network fashion, the idea
has become to outspend and outpromote the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Where that puts quality is anyone's guess. But at least it will
look interesting. These movies are filmed in expensive, exotic
locations (''Arabian Nights'' in Turkey and Yemen), include the
latest eye-catching special effects, and lure stars with name
value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alice in Wonderland'' features Gene Wilder as Mock Turtle,
Martin Short as Mad Hatter, George Wendt as Tweedledee and Whoopi
Goldberg as Cheshire Cat. Tina Majorino (''Waterworld'') portrays
the adventuresome Alice.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the costumes are gorgeous, the colorful scenery
breathtaking and the on-air promos intoxicating, you have to wonder
whether producers are giving Lewis Carroll's story the short
shrift.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that what's significant at this point is whether you
can break out of the clutter,'' says Linda De Koven, NBC's
executive vice president for movies and miniseries. ``But, believe
me, it's also whether you can do not just bigger programs but
better ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the lavish sets and the stars. Fine. But the most
important thing remains the material. Once viewers are there, they
need to have a reason to stay for two hours at the outset and then
return for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Such miniseries assertiveness hasn't been witnessed since the
1970s and the days of ``Roots'' (12 hours over eight nights),
``Rich Man, Poor Man'' (12 hours over six nights) and ``The Thorn
Birds'' (10 hours over four nights).
</P>
<P>
   But with the cable explosion of the '80s, viewers refused to
commit to so many nights, and the networks pretty much abandoned
the genre, except for spotty successes such as ``Lonesome Dove'' in
1989. They turned instead to two-night miniseries dealing with
violence and sensationalism, such as ``Baby M,'' about the
high-profile child-custody case; ``Stay the Night,'' about a
teen-age boy who kills the husband of his adult lover; ``Diana: Her
True Story;'' and the unsinkable Stephen King.
</P>
<P>
   Historical, biblical and fantasy classics are the current
fixation. ``Merlin'' and ABC's star-studded ``Cinderella,'' which
featured Whitney Houston and Brandy, so convincingly trounced their
time-slot competitors that it was inevitable that networks would
demand similar projects pronto.
</P>
<P>
   Lynda Obst, who produced ``The '60s,'' admits that sweeps films
these days must be ``events'' and that the pressure is sometimes
impossible: Make a production that's different than but still
similar to successful predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me feel incredibly responsible to get the backbone of
history right, without being a documentary,'' says Obst, whose
credits include the feature films ``Contact, Sleepless in Seattle''
and ``Hope Floats.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise for ``Cleopatra'' director Frank Roddam, who began
filming by calling 1,000 extras to work at 7 a.m. just to set ``a
discipline and a standard'' for the cast and crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted them to say, `Look, this is a big thing, that this
is an event, and we're going to do it. We're not going to let it
defeat us.' And everybody got on board with that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we were inspired not only by the vast numbers of extras
and the beauty of the country, but also the incredible power of the
story, and the challenge that it offered us. So it was a big
challenge to do battle sequences, and huge fighting sequences all
around _ working with horses, working with so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Halmi: ``This is as good as it gets. Television in the old
days, when I first started watching it, was a wonderful medium.
Sunday evenings the family sat around and joined each other, and
enjoyed seeing programs. That disappeared rather fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magic is back in these programs, and when you take a look
at them, you'll see why everyone wins. The viewer, the network.
Everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   A popular miniseries also provides a network with opportunities
to promote its prime-time series and to keep viewers away from the
competition. Perhaps adding to the urgency of miniseries production
is the correct assumption that viewer interest in this form won't
last.
</P>
<P>
   Miniseries based on literary classics have already been soundly
rejected. Halmi's ``Crime and Punishment'' _ filmed in Budapest and
starring Ben Kingsley, Julie Delpy and Patrick Dempsey _ drew such
a paltry audience for NBC that the network pushed another classic,
``The Tempest,'' out of sweeps. It turned out to be a smart move,
as few viewers watched that, either. ``Moby Dick,'' another Halmi
movie, fared only a little better for TNT.
</P>
<P>
   If the cycle turns, Halmi will have to scale back his
productions. In the meantime, he has as many as six miniseries in
the works, including ``Tenth Kingdom.''
</P>
<P>
   No budget is set for that miniseries, but it's projected to be a
massive 10-hour production. If it airs, ``Tenth Kingdom'' will
truly mark the return of a TV dinosaur.

 &HT;    Heavy travel, Delta hub help make Hartsfield busiest airport in
passenger volume
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hartsfield International Airport is officially over
the top.
</P>
<P>
   The airport handled 73.5 million travelers in 1998, eclipsing
Chicago's O'Hare International as the world's busiest in passenger
volume.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield's count rose 7.7 percent from 1997 and has nearly
doubled since 1991. The primary reasons: heavy travel spurred by a
strong economy and Delta Air Lines' steady expansion of its
connecting hub.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare, which had long held the title for most passengers,
handled about 72.5 million people last year, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare remains the leader in another measurement, takeoffs and
landings, with 897,354 last year to Hartsfield's 846,881. More
cargo flights helped O'Hare hold that lead.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Chicago has a second airport, Midway, that handled
11.4 million people and 278,919 operations. The Atlanta region is
among the largest in the country with only one airport allowing
airline service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a numbers game, and we still consider ourselves
busiest as well as best,'' said Monique Bond, spokeswoman for
Chicago's aviation department.
</P>
<P>
   So, is the ``busiest'' title any more than fodder for a public
relations debate?
</P>
<P>
   ``The most tangible effect is the ability to attract foreign
airlines, which always want a large volume of passengers when
looking for U.S. gateways,'' Hartsfield marketing chief Miguel
Southwell said. Yet he acknowledged Hartsfield's immensity is
already so well known that the recruiting impact may be minor.
</P>
<P>
   And the title comes with a price. Hartsfield's operational
capacity is 800,000 takeoffs and landings. It can handle more, as
it did last year, but not without extra delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now the most delayed airport in the country,'' Southwell
said, noting the average delay at Hartsfield is 8 minutes, compared
with 3 minutes at O'Hare.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, that dubious distinction helps Hartsfield officials
as they argue for two new full-length runways. Without them, they
say, delays will get worse and growth will stagnate, depriving the
region of economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say Hartsfield is big enough and suggest another
airport be opened to airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-Fort Worth International, Los Angeles International and
London-Heathrow will likely round out the top five-busiest airports
for 1998, but final numbers for them aren't available. Based on
partial-year numbers and growth rates, none was in a position to
overtake Hartsfield.

 &HT;    Culture in Chile `not that different,' Home Depot employees
learn
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nelson Tirado learned an important lesson about doing
business in Chile at a neighborhood barbecue in Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of working alongside many of the 300 workers at Home
Depot's first store in Chile, it was only natural that a group of
employees invited Tirado, a Home Depot regional vice president, to
one of their park picnics. After all, he unloaded trucks and helped
out on the floor just like the rest of them.
</P>
<P>
   As the meat grilled, the conversation turned to the topic of
responsibilities at home and on the job. A colleague pointed at
Tirado and joked, ``You ought to be in this guy's shoes. He's in
charge of expansion in Argentina.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget the big orange sign at the bottom of the snow-capped
Andes. This was real culture shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just couldn't believe someone like me would help out on
the floor, let alone hang out with them,'' said Tirado, who had
previously downplayed his high-level position when he arrived to
help open the store last year. The picnickers were shocked to find
out they'd been rubbing elbows with an executive. ``They're used to
bosses in Latin America who don't associate with the working
class,'' Tirado said.
</P>
<P>
   Tirado's experience was one of many that were reviewed this week
during an international management workshop at Home Depot's Atlanta
headquarters. About 30 managers used the two-day session to review
both progress and obstacles six months into the Chilean venture,
the company's first store in Latin America. The company brought in
faculty from Atlanta's Southern Center for International Studies to
teach the seminar.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday afternoon, the classroom was filled with lists of
various perceptions about the Latin American culture and economy,
ranging from monopolies to merengue. Home Depot is now looking at
subtleties in Latin America business practices as it prepares for
expansion in Argentina. One of the biggest lessons the world's
largest do-it-yourselfer had to learn was that its gung-ho culture
can be somewhat unsettling overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Chile weren't quite ready for our entrepreneurial
spirit,'' admits Mauro Pinera, director of international human
resources. Home Depot is proud of a management style that
encourages people to speak up and take initiative, and managers
were eager for Chilean employees to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   But Chilean workers were brought up in an autocratic environment
in which superiors tell them exactly what to do. ``They're not used
to the freedom, so we'll have to go slower on that,'' said Bill
Pena, regional president for Chile and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Pena says Home Depot will not force its culture overseas, but
he's hard-pressed to come up with examples of how the company is
adapting a Chilean flair. Except for tweaking its merchandise to
suit local home-building needs, the Santiago store looks exactly
like a U.S. store. It even has a McDonald's restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The Chilean employees have embraced a number of Home Depot-isms.
Several employees cried when Pena and Tirado gave them award badges
for a job well done.
</P>
<P>
   And when management brought in stools for the cashiers because
they are accustomed to sitting down in Chile, employees refused to
use them. ``They said, `If Home Depot cashiers stand up in the
U.S., we want to stand up, too,''' Pena said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the differences between the cultures
aren't that great,'' Pena said. ``Our associates there want the
same things that associates here want: recognition and reward.''

 &HT;    Sporting goods industry facing a problem _ too many outlets
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Consumers are more athletic than ever, but even the
biggest jocks would get worn out trying to sort through the choices
of sporting goods stores.
</P>
<P>
   Specialty store Just For Feet is adding 50 stores this year.
Galyan's Trading Co. is forging ahead with its giant
retail-entertainment format. Manufacturers like Nike and Reebok are
opening retail outlets at a fast clip. And the National Basketball
Association and NASCAR are testing their own retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oversaturation is the most stubborn and perplexing problem
facing the sporting goods industry,'' said John D. Riddle,
president of the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association. Riddle
is expected to send this message and a few other warnings on the
eve of the Super Show today when he gives his ``state of the
industry'' report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're continuing to see the `big box' stores going up, but I
think we're going to see a renewal of the specialty stores this
year,'' Riddle said. And designers like Tommy Hilfiger, Polo and
Nautica will continue to infiltrate department stores with their
sporty brands.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic footwear stores are feeling the most fallout from
retail expansion. For the first time since 1992, athletic shoe
sales declined last year, by 8 percent. Consumers are not as crazy
about the latest high-tech, high-price running shoes from Nike,
Reebok and others. They want ``brown shoes,'' Riddle noted.
</P>
<P>
   The sporting goods industry as a whole is coming off an anemic
year. Sales grew 1 percent to $45.6 billion in 1998, the worst year
of the 1990s for growth.
</P>
<P>
   Women are one of the bright spots for the industry. They're more
involved in fitness than ever, and manufacturers are more than
happy to come out with tailor-made products.
</P>
<P>
   ``One piece of equipment in our new products competition this
year is a batting helmet designed for long hair,'' Riddle said.
``We're seeing a lot more along those lines at this year's show.''
</P>
<P>
   Lethargic teen-agers are giving the industry a fit, though. The
number of active teens continues to slide. ``It's a big problem,
and it's something that we'll definitely have to zero in on this
year,'' Riddle said.

EL DUQUE'S MAN STASHES TWO MORE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla. , Md., Cuba, Costa Rica , Spain, Venezuela)   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost everywhere El Duque goes, Joe Cubas is sure to follow.
But he's much more than the agent who measured Orlando (El Duque)
Hernandez for a Yankee uniform and a four-year, $6.6 million
contract. He's the anti-Castro of Cuban baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an enemy of the Castro government,'' he was saying, ``but
I'm a hero of the Cuban people.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Cubas, born in Miami of Cuban parents and armed with a
business degree from Florida International University, has
shepherded two dozen Cuban defectors to baseball contracts in the
United States, including El Duque, the most celebrated of his seven
big leaguers. As spring training approaches, he has stashed two
recent Cuban defectors in San Jose, Costa Rica, for inspection next
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is a tall, slender, 21-year-old right-handed pitcher who
defected in Spain in October while with a touring Cuban team,''
Cubas said. ``The other is a 21-year-old shortstop who defected in
Venezuela in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubas would not name the two players, but he acknowledged that
half a dozen major league clubs have inquired when they will be on
display in Costa Rica for big-league scouts, as El Duque was last
March. By staying in Costa Rica, the Cubans are free agents
available for auction to the 30 major league clubs; if they were in
the United States, they would be subject to baseball's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two players are among the 40 to 50 Cuban players that
I've had the opportunity to see,'' Cubas said. ``I'd say 80 percent
of these players are capable of playing either at the major league
level or in the high minors within the next two years, 95 percent
within the next five years. The other 5 percent, sadly, have simply
grown too old. They're now past their peak as players.''
</P>
<P>
   In that 5 percent, according to Cubas, are third baseman Omar
Linares, outfielder Victor Mesa and the right-hander Lazaro Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as good as the other Cuban players are,'' Cubas said,
``there will always be just one El Duque. Others are very talented
or as talented in ability as he is, but they might not be able to
make the impact he did. He's not just a pitcher; he knows how to
pitch, how to set up hitters. He's an old-fashioned player.''
</P>
<P>
   When El Duque was suspected of planning to defect in 1996, he
was suspended from Cuban baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only was he suspended,'' Cubas said, ``they took away his
ability to make a living doing anything else; he was assigned to be
a rehab therapist at a psychiatric hospital. But it gave him an
opportunity to be humble, to understand what the handicapped and
the people with mental problems go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Before accepting a Thurman Munson Award at the Marriott Marquis
on Tuesday night to benefit the Association for the Help of
Retarded Children, Hernandez made it a point to sign an autograph
and pose for a photo with the AHRC youngsters there, then hugged
each one.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Miami, where El Duque is living now, he has his El Duque's
Kids, a foundation to help neglected and underprivileged kids,''
Cubas said. ``He's given $10,000 to the Hialeah Foundation for Kids
who have been battered and abused. And he went back to Costa Rica
to visit a hospital there for kids with cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez has purchased a home in Miami for his two young
daughters and his ex-wife, and another home there for his mother.
Cardinal John O'Connor persuaded Fidel Castro to allow Hernandez's
family to visit him after the World Series. Now his daughters,
ex-wife and mother will remain in the United States permanently.
</P>
<P>
   But Castro's gesture to Hernandez's family and the negotiations
for two baseball games in Havana and Baltimore between the Orioles
and Cuba's national team have not softened Cubas' anti-Castro
stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Orioles games will hurt,'' he said. ``This is like
America's Ping-Pong policy with China years ago. Baseball won't
solve Cuba's problems. The games would give Castro legitimacy. But
he's starving 11 million people.''
</P>
<P>
   But two of those people are now in Costa Rica, waiting for the
big-league scouts to assess them. Once they were Castro's baseball
players; now they're Joe Cubas' baseball players. There's more
where they came from. &QL;

PATRIOTS DEAL TO BE SIGNED BEHIND CLOSED DOORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The New England Patriots stadium development agreement
is expected to be completed Thursday in much the same way the deal
was speedily put together: quietly and behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   And while reports surfaced in the past week about newly realized
problems associated with the $374 million Hartford project _
including site, tax, and public works issues _ Connecticut Governor
John G. Rowland has virtually gone underground on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   His last major appearance on the stadium was a public relations
repair job a week ago when he announced inside the Capitol that the
final development agreement signing would have to be postponed for
a second time.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, lawyers have worked arduously on the more than
250-page document to build in protection for team owner Robert
Kraft in case the state cannot deliver on its promise for a clear
site _ now occupied by a steam plant _ in time for the Patriots to
move to Hartford by 2002, at the latest.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland's press office, openly annoyed at the Boston media,
imposed a blackout for a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we talk to the Boston press it comes out wrong,''
said Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani. ``We've already announced that
the development agreement is done except for the signing.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the governor is merely trying to control the
process just as he did at the start, and stifle any dissent on the
complex project after fast-tracking the legislation through the
General Assembly in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an understatement,'' said Senator John Fonfara, a
Democrat from Hartford. ``We've written a letter asking the
governor to see (key provisions of the development agreement)
before it's signed and we've never heard back regarding that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonfara, and the rest of the Hartford delegation, signed the
missive last week pressing to know if the agreement will force
Kraft to make payments in lieu of taxes on the stadium site and
whether local companies would receive construction job guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Neither issue, he said, was addressed in the initial agreement
Kraft and Rowland signed in November. Nor was it included in the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some estimates say the city will have to pay more than
$2 million a year to provide police details and other security
around the construction site.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Hartford representatives have not heard back from
Rowland's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be ignored like this,'' Fonfara huffed. ``The whole thing
has been underground.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartford collects $2.1 million a year on the land that would be
used for the 68,000-seat open-air facility. However, it appears
that the Patriots would neither pay property taxes on the site nor
make payments in lieu of taxes. The team would be assessed taxes on
a hotel Kraft must build next to the stadium. But that land is not
currently assessed by the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get about $2 million in taxes on that
development,'' Nilda Torres, a spokeswoman for Hartford Mayor
Michael Peters, said referring to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Torres said Kraft will be responsible for paying any police and
security details on the stadium property, while the city would pick
up the tab for officers on the streets surrounding the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to be that much of an increase or
that much of a problem,'' Torres said. ``The mayor and the (City)
Council feel comfortable with the picture. . . The points that were
a problem are on the road to being resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``It's pretty much the governor's project.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, CTG Resources Inc., owner of the steam plant, has not
acted on an offer by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority,
a quasi-public power agency trying to buy the company, allowing the
land to be cleared for the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The steam plant,'' Pagani said, ``has not been resolved yet.''

   OIL-SPILL (Coos Bay, Ore.) _ In a desperate move, Navy explosive
crews set off a series of charges below decks on the New Carissa,
hoping to start a massive fire that will burn off hundreds of
thousands of gallons of fuel. Officials said the move was their
last best hope. A powerful storm bearing down on Oregon would
likely rip the boat apart and the troublesome oil spill would
become an ecological disaster.

who differ in social class, race, generation and politics, who

<HEADLINE>
FORMER MORTICIAN TELLS JURY HE REGRETS KILLING WIDOW, 81 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN AUGUSTINE, Texas _ Former mortician Bernie Tiede, sobbing
uncontrollably on the witness stand at his own trial, testified
Wednesday that he profoundly regrets killing wealthy Carthage widow
Marjorie Nugent, a woman, he insisted, he deeply loved.
</P>
<P>
   But describing what led him to shoot the 81-year-old widow four
times in the back as she stooped to pet her dog, he said: ``My life
had become a prison to some degree.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiede's testimony, alternating between tears and a sometimes
condescending tone, came in the punishment phase of the trial in
which he was convicted Tuesday of murdering Nugent and stuffing her
body inside her freezer.
</P>
<P>
   While eligible for probation, the 40-year-old former Carthage
Methodist lay minister _ who was Nugent's inseparable companion for
three years _ also could be sentenced to 99 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is expected to begin deciding his sentence Thursday.
The trial was moved to this East Texas community 50 miles south of
Carthage because of heavy publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Under the gentle questioning of his almost avuncular attorney,
Clifton ``Scrappy'' Holmes of Longview, Tiede said he became
acquainted with Nugent after directing her husband's funeral in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   He felt sorry for her, he said, because she seemed lonely and
had few friends.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, she urged him to quit his job at the funeral home to
become, in essence, her companion.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me I would have more free time,'' he said, ``and I
liked that idea. But I found I didn't have any free time at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the millionaire widow offered him the benefits of her
wealth, he quickly found himself in the position of a ``personal
valet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would go over and make coffee early in the morning, between
7 and 7:30,'' Tiede testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked out the clothes she would wear. I helped with the
laundry. I trimmed her toenails. I pulled the long hairs out of her
chin. I combed her hair. I pulled on her shoes. I did just about
anything you could imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   Nugent, he contended, was relentless in her demands. She'd page
him and leave multiple messages on his telephone answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, Tiede returned the remote control to her garage
and front gate and announced he was ending their relationship. As
he backed his car out of her driveway, she used the device to close
the gates behind him, thwarting his escape.
</P>
<P>
   When he re-entered the house, she emphatically told him she was
not going to let him go. Tiede told jurors he relented, accepted
the remote control and _ though plagued by the relationship _
continued the routine for about three more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had become her sole source of entertainment on a grand
scale,'' he testified.
</P>
<P>
   Tiede admitted that he had fantasized about beating her head
with a baseball bat. But, he testified, ``I prayed ... I wondered
how I was going to handle my feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You obviously handled them the wrong way, didn't you?'' Holmes
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir,'' Tiede responded.
</P>
<P>
   He wept profusely when he described the jailhouse letters he
wrote to Nugent's relatives. ``I told them in those letters that I
wanted to apologize for abusing our friendship, ruining their
lives, my life and Marge's life,'' Tiede said. ``I pray God will
give them strength to face their lives and forgive me for the
things I've done wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Panola County District Attorney Danny Buck Davidson concentrated
on the privileges and wealth Tiede gained from his relationship
with Nugent. The defendant's stepmother had testified earlier that
even as a boy, Tiede was fascinated with money.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the aged woman, he made numerous trips to New
York, San Francisco and Las Vegas, flying first-class _ especially
on long foreign trips. ``The seats are somewhat larger and I'm a
big man,'' the 6-foot, 3-inch tall, 265-pound defendant said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiede testified he and Nugent used her money to visit Germany,
Hong Kong, England, Scotland, Wales, Thailand, Russia, Canada and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   They also saw the Broadway musical, ``Les Miserables.'' Noting
Tiede's correct French pronunciation of the play based on Victor
Hugo's novel, the prosecutor asked, ``Do you feel you're a somewhat
sophisticated person?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Meaning what?'' Tiede responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, how to pronounce the name of the play,'' said
Davidson, who earlier had mispronounced it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't take much sophistication to do that,'' Tiede said,
somewhat haughtily, prompting laughter in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Tiede testified that Nugent willingly paid his expenses and
often made arrangements herself.
</P>
<P>
   After he killed her, he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on businesses and to buy friends cars and other gifts. Shortly
before his arrest in August 1997, he visited Paris, financing the
trip with his former companion's money.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Davidson rolled Nugent's freezer toward Tiede _
the same appliance where Nugent's body had been hidden for nine
months. Tiede pointedly refused to look at it, while Davidson led
him on a methodically grim reprise of Nugent's final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie, you pointed the gun at her and pulled the trigger ...
''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir, I did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Four.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened after the first bullet?
</P>
<P>
   ``She fell to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was still breathing ... '' Davidson pressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I shot her again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tearfully, Tiede described how he emptied the freezer of food,
placed Nugent inside, covered her with a sheet, then replaced the
frozen vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   After washing blood from the garage and depositing the spent
shells in the garbage, Tiede went home to shower. Later he attended
a dress rehearsal of a play at a local college.
</P>
<P>
   He ended the day by treating 40 young actors to pizza at a local
restaurant.

&HT;        SPECTER WILL NOT CONVICT OR ACQUIT CLINTON IN IMPEACHMENT
TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 10 -- Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter will not
vote to convict President Clinton in the Senate's impeachment
trial, he announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But he won't vote to acquit the president either.
</P>
<P>
   Calling it a ``sham trial,'' Specter said he will vote that the
obstruction of justice and perjury charges against the president
were ``not proven.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing Scottish law, Specter said a juror has three choices for
a verdict: guilty, not guilty or not proven.
</P>
<P>
   By not voting to convict, Specter said he doesn't necessarily
think Clinton is not guilty of the charges. He thinks the ability
of the House impeachment managers to prove the charges was hindered
because the Senate wouldn't allow live witness testimony. He also
said he thought there was a lack of relevant evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Specter was among three Republicans to announce Wednesday he
will break party ranks when senators vote on the two articles of
impeachment. Republican Sens. James Jeffords of Vermont and John
Chafee of Rhode Island made public their intentions to acquit
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``not proven'' isn't an option for senators when they
vote, Specter said he may have to vote ``present,'' which is
allowed under Senate rules.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is likely to be acquitted when the Senate takes its
final vote expected late Thursday or early Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I vote 'not proven' and they lead me away, it will be one
of the only exciting elements of the day,'' Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   With the announcement, Specter broke his month-long silence
about the case. He had vowed not to discuss his thoughts while he
was a juror.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania's other senator, Republican Rick Santorum, respects
Specter's decision and will not announce his own intentions before
the vote, his spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his [Specter's] decision alone,'' Robert Traynham,
Santorum's spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he knew his vote of ``not proven'' made his
feelings about the charges difficult to pin down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not being a little ambiguous,'' Specter said. ``I'm being
a lot ambiguous ... even amorphous.''
</P>
<P>
   Angering both sides of the political spectrum with his vote was
a risk Specter was willing to take, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've certainly done that before,'' he said and laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he won't vote for a censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't vote for findings of fact and I won't vote for
censure,'' Specter said. ``I will vote 'not proven' and then go
home.''

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ Conventional wisdom says that in
the aftermath of the impeachment trial, the Republicans will suffer
and Democrats will prosper at the hands of the voters. But anyone
who watched the proceedings with an open mind had to be impressed
by the demeanor, dedication and potential of four young House
Republicans _ James Rogan of California, Asa Hutchinson of
Arkansas, Edward Bryant of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South
Carolina. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON. (Already filed.)

<P>
   MIAMI _ In a classroom of newly arrived Cubans, Alex Alvarez, a
Cuban transplant himself, wasted no time recently scaring his
students straight. ``Welcome to the capitalist system,'' he said.
``Each one of you is responsible for the amount of money you have
in your pocket. The government is not responsible for whether you
eat or whether you're poor or rich. The government doesn't
guarantee youa job or a house.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've come to a rich and powerful country, but it is up to
you whether or not you continue living like you did in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Such warnings were not necessary 40 years ago, when Cubans
fleeing Fidel Castro settled down here to await _ some to plot _
his downfall. They came from a capitalist system, with enough
education and the necessary ambition to fulfill the American dream.
But Castro has lasted so long that Miami now reflects different
Cubas.
</P>
<P>
   The people from today's Cuba, the children of the revolution,
include those filling out job applications in Alvarez's class at
the Training and Employment Council of South Florida, where he
admonishes them, ``Put down `High School, Havana, Cuba.' Do not
write `Secundaria Ho Chi Minh.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The people from an earlier Cuba and their children have grown
into a Miami Who's Who. The mayors of the city and county of Miami,
the county police chief and the county state attorney are all
Cuban-born or of Cuban descent. So are the president of the largest
bank, the owner of the largest real estate developer, the managing
partner of the largest law firm, nearly half of the county's
27-member delegation in the state Legislature and two of its six
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   About the only accomplishment Cuban-Americans cannot claim is
regaining their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an irony and pathos about the situation,'' a
University of Miami sociologist and expert on Cuban affairs, Max
Castro, said. ``They have succeeded as immigrants and failed as
exiles.''
</P>
<P>
   That success and failure is etched on Miami, the main repository
of Cuban dreams and dissent in the United States, where the news
one day can be about the welcoming of a Cuban-American company's
shares to the New York Stock Exchange and the next day about the
arrest of four aging exiles embarking on a mission to assassinate
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   But immigration over the decades has made Miami so distinctly
Cuban that the cultural clash is no longer between Cubans and
Americans as much as between different waves of Cuban immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   With each batch of immigrants who win the annual visa lottery
and with each smuggled boatload of Cubans that land almost daily in
South Florida, Cuban Miami becomes less cohesive, encompassing a
people who differ in social class, race, generation and politics,
and who increasingly come from different worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The first and latest waves of Cubans, particularly, said a
sociologist at the University of Michigan, Silvia Pedraza, ``live
side by side but remain aloof from one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently the federal government had an open door policy
for Cuban immigrants, welcoming them as victims of communism. They
still get special treatment. Each year, 20,000 Cubans are granted
visas by lot. Many of those who make it here illegally are allowed
to stay. Unlike many other immigrants, Cubans meeting certain
criteria are also eligible for government acculturation classes and
welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants from Cuba still count on welcoming relatives like
Efrain Veiga, who left Cuba as a child in 1962 and now, at 47, is
the successful owner of Yuca, a restaurant in Miami Beach. Veiga
has visited Cuba twice and regularly sends money to relatives
there.
</P>
<P>
   But even Veiga was startled by his latest experience with a
cousin, whom he had helped leave the island, put up in his home
here and given a job in his restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Veiga said he was surprised when his cousin balked at working
weekends. The restaurant owner was outright shocked, he said, when
one of his waiters showed up for work one day wearing a pair of
expensive shoes he had given his cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did you get those shoes?'' Veiga asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your cousin sold them to me,'' the waiter replied.
</P>
<P>
   Veiga has hired other newcomers from Cuba and found many of them
also stuck in the day-to-day survival mode of modern Cuba, where
trading shoes for dollars could mean food on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their lifestyle and way of thinking are different,'' Veiga
said. ``Deep down they feel we owe them something, that we've had
it better.''
</P>
<P>
   The shock is mutual. Students in Alvarez's class said one of
their biggest surprises in the United States was how hard people
work. Another is how ``Americanized'' their compatriots have
become, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so materialistic,'' said Olga Rodriguez, 40, who
came legally last year with a 22-year-old son and 15-year-old
daughter. ``It's like they have the dollar sign on their forehead.
It hasn't happened to me yet. I offer rides to classmates in
language school even if I have to go out of my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Marquez, 30, arrived in the United States after a year
in refugee camps in Panama and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Only one of
several distant relatives offered to put him up when he finally got
here in 1995, and then only for two weeks. He said no thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think we all steal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez, a painter and sculptor who sold his art on the streets
of Havana, said his relatives had also painted too rosy a picture
of life here. ``I thought that this was a wonderland, that you'd
kick a rock and money would fall out,'' he said. Instead, he has
bounced from job to job and now works as a busboy in a Boca Raton
beach club while struggling to start a pest control business.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez does not regret leaving Cuba, and if the experience of
most of those who came before him is any guide, he, too, will make
it. Cuba, however, still has the pull of the 7-year-old daughter
and a brother. He calls them both, sends clothes when he can and
plans to visit them once he becomes an American citizen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not political, but from a human standpoint, they're
killing of hunger the people, not Fidel,'' he said, explaining why
he opposed the American trade embargo of Cuba. ``People here think
that in Cuba a group could get organized to take Fidel out. That's
really easy to say with a full stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that many older exiles have lost touch, living off
memories that may or may not be accurate. But full stomachs have
not tempered the craving for their homeland of those who settled
here in the 1960s, fleeing the radicalization of the island and
fearing political persecution and Communist indoctrination of their
children. They have recreated a pre-revolution Cuba here, renaming
streets after Cuban martyrs, reactivating Cuban social clubs, trade
organizations and businesses, filling supermarket shelves with
``Cubano'' versions of coffee, cheese and bread.
</P>
<P>
   In this parallel Cuban universe, Jose Lopez-Silvero, 78, and
Alfredo Blanco, 80, president and vice president of the Sugar
Producers of Cuba Inc., which represents those whose companies were
nationalized by the Castro regime, can say exactly how much their
former sugar mills are producing today, how much the mills' workers
earn. They have not seen Cuba since they left in 1960, but their
information is all first-hand, gleaned from recent arrivals and
letters from Cuba. Their ties, while no longer familial, remain
emotional.

ALLEGED MISMANAGEMENT OF $50 BILLION RESERVE SHAKES RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ How much skulduggery does it take to shock people in a
country widely thought to be one of the most corrupt in the world?
</P>
<P>
   How about mismanaging as much as $50 billion of the country's
reserves by Russia's Central Bank?
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the accusations leveled by Russia's outgoing
general prosecutor, Yury Skuratov, just before he resigned last
week, citing health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1993 and 1998, Skuratov charged, the Central Bank
allegedly paid an obscure offshore assets-management company to
handle the money, instead of managing it itself, as central banks
usually do. Western economists here call the practice unprecedented
for the caretaker of a country's national wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov also accused Central Bank executives of illegal sales
of government property and of maintaining extravagant lifestyles at
state expense.
</P>
<P>
   In many places, such charges lodged by a top law-enforcement
official would set off a political firestorm. Outside Russia, the
allegations are bound to raise even more doubts about the wisdom of
granting Moscow's request for new loans. But inside Russia, where
benefiting from government funds has been a traditional path to
upward mobility, the reaction has been rather quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank chairman, Viktor Gerashchenko, even confirmed
the practice, if not the sums involved. Gerashchenko said Russia
needed to hide its assets to avoid seizure by creditors owed
billions of dollars of Soviet-era debt that Russia has promised to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Gerashchenko said that in 1994 the Central Bank transferred $1.4
billion to the accounts of FIMACO, a company registered on the
Island of Jersey, off England.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time Russia was involved in difficult negotiations
with the (creditors), and there was a probability that the
country's foreign property could be seized,'' Gerashchenko said in
comments reported by The Moscow Times. ``FIMACO was set up to avoid
complications.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Skuratov's letter, which was handed out to members
of the State Duma lower house of parliament, the Central Bank
allowed FIMACO to handle $37.3 billion, 9.98 billion Deutsche
marks, 379.9 billion yen, 11.98 billion French francs and 862.6
million British pounds. This amounts to almost $50 billion at
current rates of exchange, and, Skuratov said, included funds from
multibillion-dollar loan packages from the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Western economists have been scratching their heads in
amazement. Eric Kraus, head of the fixed incomes desk at Dresdner
Bank's Moscow office, called the allegations and Gerashchenko's
partial confirmation ``astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraus said he thought the $50 billion figure was ``doubtless
exaggerated'' because the Central Bank ``never had that much to
manage.'' But he was left with more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who actually managed this money, and how was it invested, what
were the results, how much was charged for this service, to whom
did the profits go, and where is the money now?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows. Nor will they ever, if some Russian politicians
have their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong to launch a criminal proceeding only on the
basis of the transfer of money to this firm,'' remarked lawmaker
Georgy Luntovsky, who chairs the Duma's committee that oversees the
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say nothing in Russian law prevents the Central Bank
from acting as it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing illegal about commercial activities by the
Central Bank that do not always coincide with the interests of the
state,'' said Georgy Bovt, political commentator of the liberal
daily Segodnya.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bovt said the government should investigate whether
anyone profited personally from the offshore investing of
government funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bovt and other analysts suggested that Skuratov's charges
stemmed from an investigation into the causes of Russia's financial
collapse last August, when the government devalued the ruble and
defaulted on $40 billion of domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
   The target of this investigation had been former Central Bank
chairman Sergei Dubinin, whom Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
replaced with Gerashchenko when Primakov was appointed in
September. But the current allegations have dragged Gerashchenko, a
former Soviet Central Banker who also held Russia's top bank post
from 1992 to 1994, into the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe this is what forced Skuratov to resign. Others say
the prosecutor's downfall was caused by another probe that came
into the open last week with a series of raids by security agents
on companies linked to the influential financier and power broker
Boris Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps both Skuratov's ouster and Berezovsky's troubles are
connected with Primakov's recent moves to consolidate the powers he
received when Yeltsin informally pass over day-to-day control of
the country to him last fall. Whatever the explanation, none of
this is improving the image of Russia's leaders abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are working out their differences in this way in public,
and no one is thinking how Western creditors are looking at this,''
Bovt said.

 MIAMI: remain emotional. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sugar producers want to recover their nationalized
properties, which had been with some families for generations and
which they regard as stolen. Their group also has a plan for
restoring the sugar industry to its past glory in ``post-Communist
Cuba,'' one of many reconstruction plans hatched all over Miami for
the moment Cuba gains its ``freedom,'' as if Castro's four-decade
rule has been just a temporary setback, a bad dream.
</P>
<P>
   In their long exile, Blanco, still a sugar trader and sugar
company executive, and Lopez-Silvero, a retired corporate legal
consultant, have supported the 37-year-old American embargo. They
blame its failure to induce democratic change in Cuba on past
Soviet subsidies and what they deem lax enforcement of its toughest
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   They have seen change come close _ before the Bay of Pigs
invasion failed, after the Berlin wall fell _ only to be let down.
Now, they say, it is only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Castro has to die some day,'' said Blanco, who is eight years
older than the ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the early immigrants' children, however, are not waiting
to get a first-hand taste of Cuba. Fed by their parents' nostalgia,
aided by contacts allowed with Cuba, driven more by curiosity than
patriotism, they help fill clubs that feature Cuban bands from the
island and the charter flights to Havana that leave several times a
week from Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Blanco, 30, a civil engineer born in Madrid to Cuban
exiles and raised in Miami, visited Cuba in 1994 for the first
time. He said the country did not deviate much from the
descriptions he had heard growing up, ``except for the poverty,''
and he felt totally at ease. Last year he published a book of poems
that laid out some of the feelings of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years they have come for you, awkward-size envelopes
labeled `Por Avion,' '' reads one poem. ``Monthly, you would peel
eggshell pages, the white onionskin paper telling details: Kiki's
first steps, your mother's death, dates approximated by the
postmarks. Sometimes with pictures: mute black and whites, poor
photos of poor cousins I would handle looking for my resemblance in
the foreign image of an ear, an eyebrow, or a nose.''
</P>
<P>
   While Miami's Cuban population evolves with American-born
generations and newcomers, other demographic forces at work are
changing the face of Hispanic Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans are still the single largest Latin American group, making
up about 60 percent of the total Hispanic population, which
accounts for more than half of Miami-Dade County's population. But
while the Cuban influx was accompanied by the flight of local
whites, it coincided with the arrival of other Hispanic immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin Americanization of Miami is slowly chipping away at
the dominant Cuban identity. In Little Havana, storefronts
advertise Salvadoran corn pancakes and waitresses hail from
Honduras and Peru; on the radio, only one of three stations
continue its Cuba-oriented talk and the area's highest-rated
Spanish-language station is Colombian.
</P>
<P>
   But if the tone is less virulent and the voices more diverse,
prompting moderate and liberal Cuban-Americans to come out in the
open, Miami's political discourse and much of the media coverage is
still largely defined by hard-edge conservatism. At times the city
has the feel of a bubble suspended in time, where issues are
debated as if Castro had just taken over, where ``communist'' is
still the ultimate insult.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown that a majority of Cubans here oppose even
beginning a political dialogue with the Cuban government while
Castro remains in power, a position zealously guarded by
Cuban-Americans whose influence in Washington was personified by
the founder of the Cuban American National Foundation, the late
Jorge Mas Canosa, a man whom presidents consulted on policy toward
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   That unwavering stance, coupled with an image of political
intolerance and violent episodes of right-wing extremism, has won
the exiles little international sympathy. Castro, some political
experts say, has proved far more shrewd at public relations than
his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seen as a narrow-minded,'' Castro, the University of
Miami sociologist, said. ``The one political success has been to
turn U.S. policy in a hard-line direction, and that hasn't worked
because it has the negative connotation that it hurts Cuban
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans like Bill Teck, editor of the magazine
``Generation N,'' a term applied to bicultural Hispanics members of
Generation X, said his readers and employees differ on Cuba policy
issues but share a frustration that so many see Cuba through a
romantic prism, blind to its political prisoners, its lack of
democratic elections, its human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we talk about is the failure of the cause of a free Cuba
to permeate the pop culture,'' said Teck, who was born here to an
American father and a Cuban mother.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE - OPTIONAL MATERIALS FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But among the younger generations, the conservative message has
become less strident.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Penelas, the Miami-born, 37-year-old mayor of Miami-Dade
County and an ambitious politician many here expect to someday run
for president, has inherited the conservatism of his parents. His
father narrowly escaped a death sentence for plotting against
Castro in 1960, he said; Penelas never met his paternal
grandfather, who died in Cuba, and he blames Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced of this generational gap people talk
about,'' said the mayor, who is fluent in both English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of his elders, however, Penela has bicultural
sensibilities. He said he would not have snubbed Nelson Mandela for
his friendship with Castro, as Miami's Cuban leadership did when
the South African leader visited here in 1990. The incident, which
included the withdrawal of an official welcoming proclamation,
prompted a three-year black tourism boycott of Miami-Dade County
and worsened feelings of alienation among blacks here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have met him, given him the proclamation and used the
opportunity'' to give Mandela his opinion of Castro, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And although he has lobbied for traditional Cuban-American
causes like the embargo, he has also reached out to black
constituents, championed gay rights and taken up the concerns of
the numerous ethnic groups who now call Miami home.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba still beckons, however. Penelas envisions ``migration
challenges'' from the island when the Communist Party loosens its
grip on the island, as Cubans here expect after Castro dies. But he
also sees an economic bonanza for Miami in trade and tourism if the
embargo is lifted.
</P>
<P>
   He also expects to play some role in Cuba's transition to
democracy, plans that are shared by many other Cuban-Americans and
that some predict will create new conflict as a post-Castro Cuba is
reshaped. But like most Cuban-Americans, naturalized or native
born, he would stay put in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 30 percent of the about 600,000 Cuban-Americans here
would move to the island, polls show. This is where more than half
of all Cubans in the United States have chosen to live, where the
old have doctors, pensions and offspring and where the young find
opportunity and their own roots.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, after all, is home.

HOUSE PASSES BILL TO CURB LAWS THAT IMPOSE COSTS ON BUSINESSES  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ga., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the new Congress' first hard-fought vote on
legislation, the House of Representatives approved a bill Wednesday
that would make it harder for Congress to pass laws that imposed
costs on businesses, as environmental laws have done.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was strongly favored by business groups and was
opposed by labor and environmental groups. A similar bill passed
the House last year but died in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 274-149, with support from dozens of Democrats and
all but 11 Republicans in the House, but it came after extensive
debate in which opponents twice failed by just a handful of votes
to significantly weaken the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The debate in the House shows that the question of relief for
businesses from what they see as burdensome federal regulations
remains a potent and divisive issue, as it has been since
Republicans gained control in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Called the ``Mandates Information Act,'' the bill would allow
any member of Congress to raise a parliamentary objection to any
bill whose provisions would impose costs of at least $100 million
on private businesses. That would cut off debate on the bill unless
lawmakers immediately voted to overrule the objection.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors said the measure would make sure that lawmakers did not
approve bills that might do unintended harm to businesses. But
opponents said its effect would be to stymie health, safety and
environmental protections for the public.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y., who offered one of the defeated
amendments to the bill, said the proposal was ``designed to do one
thing and only one thing _ shut down debate on any measure that
someone claims will cost industry money, regardless of the evidence
on costs, regardless of the benefits, regardless of the public
purpose to be served, regardless of whether some companies support
the measure.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., said the bill would improve on a
1995 law that placed similar restrictions on Congress when it tried
to pass bills that cost state and local governments money to
enforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``For far too many years,'' Linder said, ``this Congress has
voted for warm and fuzzy things, and not to tax the public for the
costs, but to pass them on to state and local governments and the
private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Boehlert's amendment was defeated by a vote of 216-210, with 34
Republicans voting to change the bill in ways that its sponsors
said would completely remove its teeth.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., also failed,
216-203. Supported by every major environmental group in the
country, this amendment would put the same procedural barriers in
place every time a bill or amendment threatened to weaken existing
environmental laws.

   Last fall, Visa International gave three of the nation's largest
banks extra seats on its board to appease the giants' concerns that
they got too little bang for their buck from the credit-card
association.
</P>
<P>
   Visa, which is owned by a consortium of banks that share
marketing and processing costs for the credit-card network, had
been sparring with the newly merged banking behemoths, especially
Citigroup and BankAmerica Corp., about how advertising and related
issues should be handled; additional board seats were awarded to
help calm things down.
</P>
<P>
   But this version of detente failed.
</P>
<P>
   And with Citigroup's decision last week to begin yanking a large
part of its business away from Visa and giving it to Mastercard
International, the credit-card industry's Cold War is heating up.
At stake is the shape of the credit-card business and the roles
played by the two dominant credit-card associations.
</P>
<P>
   The merger boom that has reordered the banking industry has
created a handful of giants who apparently feel little need to
share the costs and marketing arrangements that made Visa and
Mastercard so attractive: Thirty years ago, credit cards were
rarely-used pieces of plastic and banks were largely restricted
from operating nationally.
</P>
<P>
   While about 6,600 banks and other institutions now issue credit
cards, just seven companies control two-thirds of all cards issued.
Analysts expect the credit-card business to continue to consolidate
in fewer and fewer hands. Both Visa and Mastercard, recognizing how
much leverage the big banks wield, have been approaching the
biggest credit-card issuers recently with offers of lower fees in
return for transferring most of their business to just one of the
associations, according to bankers involved in the moves.
</P>
<P>
   A Visa spokesman said the company had been pursuing the discount
strategy since last year to ``award participation in Visa.''
Mastercard declined to comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   But the ante was raised last week when two Citigroup executives,
including co-chief executive John Reed, resigned from Visa's board
after the association failed to meet Citigroup's demand that the
``Citi'' brand name be more heavily promoted on television
commercials and on the cards. Citigroup will begin moving new
business exclusively to Mastercard, which is more amenable to
Citigroup's goals.
</P>
<P>
   Reed asserted recently that BankAmerica chief executive Hugh
McColl and Bank One Corp. chief executive John McCoy were inclined
to follow his lead in more openly flouting Visa's conventions _ a
proclamation that appears to be something of a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, BankAmerica, and Bank One rank first, second and
fifth in size in the United States and are the biggest banks on
Visa's 11-member board. They are also the only banks that have two
board seats. Bank One is the leading credit-card issuer in the
country, followed by Citigroup. BankAmerica is the seventh-largest
issuer, according to the Nilson Report, a trade publication based
in Oxnard, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica, created by last year's merger of Nationsbank Corp.
and BankAmerica, declined to comment directly on its relationship
with Visa but appears to be disposed toward Citigroup's way of
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do remain advocates for changes in how the card
associations operate, not only in the brand but in the marketing
they do,'' said Robert Wynne, a BankAmerica spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But Bank One, a product of last year's merger of First Chicago
NBD Corp. and Bank One, seems less inclined to share Citigroup's
views. While the bank declined to comment Wednesday, Bank One
executives close to McCoy said he thinks branding is not of
paramount importance to his bank _ largely because Bank One issues
a lot of affinity cards that already emphasize several different
brands.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Citigroup has many more global interests than either
BankAmerica or Bank One. In overseas markets, Citigroup has ample
reason to believe it can carve out a distinct identity for itself
in the credit-card business. Although Visa has almost twice the
market share of Mastercard, analysts said consumers carrying
Citigroup cards would notice little change because Mastercard is
accepted at almost all the same places as Visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``For nearly two decades, Citigroup was the top dog at Visa and
now Bank One is and Citi has decided to take its ball and go play
in Mastercard's court,'' said David Robertson, the president of the
Nilson Report. ``Citi and other big banks were willing to be team
players in the financing of Visa until that payment system was well
established. Now that's accomplished and the landscape is
changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing tensions between Visa and its member banks are likely
to be the main topic when Visa's board meets Friday. For its part,
Visa said it remained committed to operating as it always has _
putting the Visa brand name at the center of marketing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Anything else, said Visa executive vice president Michael
Beindorff, ``would squander all of the elements of the Visa joint
venture with banks, which has been one of the most successful joint
ventures in history.'' &QL;

SENATORS EXPRESS BOTH SADNESS AND OUTRAGE OVER CLINTON'S BEHAVIOR
</HEADLINE>
   (See related stories: IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-SCENE,
IMPEACH-LIEBERMAN, IMPEACH-GRAMM) 
(sw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Shameful, despicable, untrustworthy, a disgrace
to his office,'' said one lawmaker. ``Reprehensible,'' said
another, ``and morally wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The adjectives and phrases, employed to describe President
Clinton and his conduct could not have been more damning. But the
senators using them _ Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., in the first case
and James Jeffords, R-Vt., in the second _ were formally announcing
that they would vote to acquit Clinton on both articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And their comments, made public outside the chamber as examples
of what the senators had said or would say inside, opened a
peephole into private deliberations that featured divergent
assessments of the president's fitness to inhabit the White House
but widespread agreement that he was, at best, a woefully
disappointing tenant.
</P>
<P>
   An aura of sadness _ and sometimes, outrage _ permeated
senators' speeches in the chamber on Wednesday and hovered over the
lawmakers themselves, according to interviews with senators and the
statements that some of them released.
</P>
<P>
   ``This impeachment process has been distressing on a personal
level because I came into it with a great deal of respect for
President Clinton,'' Jeffords said in the statement he released on
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the final outcome,'' the senator said, ``I will leave
this trial with the knowledge that the president has indeed
committed shameful acts, misled the American people and brought
disrepute on the office of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The president has lied to his family and the nation,
and this he must live with.''
</P>
<P>
   That the stinging words of Jeffords and Wellstone accompanied
decisions to acquit the president reflected many senators' belief
that Clinton's wrongdoing did not represent the kind of ``high
crimes and misdemeanors'' that warrant expulsion from office.
</P>
<P>
   The statements that several senators made public Tuesday and
Wednesday marked a shell game of sorts: Because Senate rules
prohibit the lawmakers from discussing the content of closed
sessions, senators were careful to portray the statements as
something other than texts of the speeches they had given, or were
planning to give, in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   But it was obvious that in most cases, the statements were
condensed, expanded or slightly altered versions of those remarks.
</P>
<P>
   During breaks in Wednesday's deliberations, senators said the
tone of the sessions was collegial, candid and, at times, somber.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of emotion and clear thought,'' said Sen. Mary
Landrieu, D-La. ``I frankly wish it would be open, because people
would be proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said: ``People are not playing to the
cameras. They're not delivering Hollywood-style speeches, but are
talking from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Few if any of the senators who walked to the well took less than
10 minutes to deliver their remarks, their colleagues said, while
some speakers hit the 15-minute limit and were reminded of it by a
crisp rap of the gavel.
</P>
<P>
   The statements that some of them released suggested that the
speeches in the chamber frequently homed in on the tiniest nuggets
of evidence and subtlest nuances of testimony. But beneath that
analysis, or appended to it, were expressions of overarching
disillusionment with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not trustworthy,'' Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said in a
written statement asserting that he would vote to convict Clinton
of both perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply to be near him in the White House has meant not only
tragic heartache for his wife and his daughter, but enormous legal
bills for staff members and friends who admired him and yearned for
his success,'' Lugar added.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., announced that he would
vote to acquit the president on both counts, he offered a rueful
commentary on the events of the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This scandal has seriously bruised every institution that has
come in contact with it, but none has been battered more than the
executive branch itself,'' Dodd said in a statement released
several hours after he formally addressed his colleagues in the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culpability for this damage lies first and foremost with
President Clinton,'' Dodd said. ``History will judge his actions
and significant lapses of judgment harshly, as it should.''

 &HT;    ``Friends'' reveal their secret twosome
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time isn't one of ``Friends' '' best buds.
</P>
<P>
   TV's perkiest bunch of pals is, if some of the characters aren't
already, cracking 30. And it's hard to imagine their over-the-top
lifestyles and whimsy will translate much longer. Turn around in a
couple of seasons and Jennifer Aniston's Rachel might play like
Kirstie Ally on ``Veronica's Closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nope, we don't want to go there.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, ``Friends'' is working just fine. Even great
sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   Take tonight's episode _ ``The One Where Everybody Finds Out''
(8 p.m. on NBC (8343)). We've been waiting since the end of last
season for the whole gang to clue in that Monica (Courteney Cox)
and Chandler (Matthew Perry) are a secret twosome. And the final
revelations unfolding tonight are a hoot.
</P>
<P>
   Joey (Matt LeBlanc) already knows. Rachel knows, but only Joey
knows that Rachel knows. And once Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) knows and
Monica and Chandler don't know that their two gal pals know,
``Friends'' turns into a contest the likes of which TV hasn't seen
since ``Seinfeld's'' ``master of your domain'' game.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. ``Friends'' isn't ``Seinfeld'' when
``Seinfeld'' was at its best. Not by a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   But it's likely TV's best sitcom this season. Monica and
Chandler's cute coupling is certainly more pleasing than the
previous angst-heavy pairing of Rachel and Ross (David Schwimmer).
</P>
<P>
   It's clear these actors are in perfect sync with their
characters. As poor, dumb Joey, LeBlanc's wise facial expressions
this season have been classic. And Kudrow has been as marvelous as
she was in her Oscar-worthy performance in ``The Opposite of Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, her Phoebe takes on Chandler in a laugh-out-loud,
toe-to-toe sex contest. She's a wonder to watch. She and all her
friends.

   Cranes in a triptyc a city street. Todd (Stephen Berra) was an
old flame of Felicity's (Keri Russell) who'd come back to bug her,
and she had just given him the brush-off when along came the bus
and boom! Followed by ``to be continued . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The WB didn't want to say whether Todd lives or dies, but in its
listing for next week's conclusion of the two-parter (9 p.m.
Tuesday), Berra is listed in the credits, so it must not have been
that bad of a bus accident.

 &HT;    Falwell comes late to Teletubby psychobabble
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the flap over whether Tinky Winky the Teletubby is gay, the
real news is that the Rev. Jerry Falwell is late to the party.
</P>
<P>
   This little game has been played in some circles for almost two
years, and Falwell is only now getting it. Maybe he was still too
busy fuming over the woman he once called ``Ellen Degenerate'' and
just hasn't been paying attention. Some cultural watchdog.
</P>
<P>
   For those who missed it, Falwell has accused a character in the
popular children's show ``Teletubbies'' of being homosexual,
pointing out that Tinky Winky is a boy who carries a purse and has
a triangle (a gay symbol in some circles) on his head. The
Teletubbies are four British characters in big felt costumes with
TV sets in their bellies who speak mostly in nonsense, hug a lot,
dance around and are as popular as Barney the purple dinosaur among
2-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Itsy Bitsy Entertainment Co., which licenses the
Teletubbies in the United States, says Tinky Winky doesn't carry a
purse, he carries a ``magic bag,'' and that Falwell's charge is
``absurd and kind of offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also kind of old. The Tubbies debuted in England in March
1997 and were a huge hit with the zwieback and apple juice set from
the get-go. By July 1997, The Guardian newspaper in London was
calling TW a ``gay icon (who) . . . prances around in a
particularly camp fashion.'' That was about the time the producers
changed the actor inside the purple costume, reportedly, according
to whispers in the gay community, because the first actor was too
effeminate in his portrayal of TW.
</P>
<P>
   The gay subtext of TW became a running item in British papers.
``Tinky Winky is the first queer role model for toddlers,'' said
Andy Medhurst, a media studies lecturer at Sussex University.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, PBS brought the Tubbsters across the Atlantic,
figuring, correctly, that they were the next Barney (last year,
sales of Teletubby merchandise passed Barney and were second only
to ``Sesame Street'' among PBS kids' shows). And almost
immediately, Internet posters picked up the debate over whether TW
is gay, or at least if he could be considered gay.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Musto, gay nightlife columnist for Village Voice,
certainly thought so back in April 1997, and this year The
Washington Post matter-of-factly called TW ``the gay Teletubby'' in
an in-and-out list (not who's in and out of the closet).
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, the gay magazine The Advocate presciently wrote
that ``PBS is clearly terrified that the same fundamentalists who
boycott Disney are going to flip once they get wind of the latest
lavender love puppet.''
</P>
<P>
   Which pretty much brings us up to date, meaning Falwell's
Earth-to-Jerry discovery that something is up in Teletubby-land.
The ensuing hue and cry calls to mind a widespread rumor in the
early '90s that Bert and Ernie of ``Sesame Street'' were more than
just roommates, which reached the point that ``Sesame Street''
producers had to deny it in The New York Times, as well as an
extremist whispering campaign that Barney was the Antichrist, which
so far has not yet come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   So if Musto and Falwell agree that Tinky Winky is a latter-day
Oscar Wilde (albeit one in a purple felt suit), does that mean he
is?
</P>
<P>
   From all indications, Itsy Bitsy Entertainment and PBS are in
this to make money. PBS got burned on the merchandising agreement
with Barney's creators several years ago and reportedly cut a
better deal to get a piece of Tubby sales. Some reports indicate
the Teletubby merchandise market may be worth as much as $2 billion
by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Do you really think they're going to jeopardize that to push a
sexual agenda on toddlers in the form of a debatable subtext?
</P>
<P>
   The color to think about when you think of ``Teletubbies'' isn't
lavender _ it's green.

$1.5 MILLION AWARDED TO SMOKER WITH CANCER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (jw) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A state jury in San Francisco has awarded $1.5 million in
compensatory damages from the Philip Morris Cos. to a woman who
says her inoperable lung cancer was caused by more than 35 years of
smoking cigarettes, primarily Philip Morris' Marlboro brand.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, returned late Tuesday and followed Wednesday by the
beginning of the jury's deliberations on punitive damages, was the
third in the last three years in which judgments had been awarded
smokers who contended that cigarette makers had failed to warn them
adequately of smoking's hazards. The two other awards, both against
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., were later overturned, and no
such verdict has ever survived appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest judgment could portend further legal problems for
the tobacco companies in California, by far the most populous
state, because it resulted from the first cigarette lawsuit to
reach a jury since the 1997 repeal of a state law that barred
individuals' product liability suits against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of cigarette company stocks fell sharply Wednesday in
response to the verdict. Philip Morris was off $3.8125 a share, to
close at $41.5625, and the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. was down
$1.375, closing at $27.3125.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Philip Morris, the largest cigarette maker,
said it would not comment on the case until after the
punitive-damages phase was completed. In addition to the $1.5
million to compensate the plaintiff, Patricia Henley, for medical
costs, pain and suffering, her lawyer, Madelyn Chaber, has asked
the jurors to award her $15 million to punish the company for the
negligence and fraud that was found in the verdict returned on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henley, 52, of Los Angeles, discovered last year that she
had inoperable lung cancer. Although lawyers for Philip Morris
argued that she had understood the risks of smoking, her suit said
she had smoked since she was a teen-ager, taking up the habit a few
years before government-required warning labels began appearing on
cigarette packages in 1966. The tobacco companies, she said, never
told smokers that addiction might leave them incapable of quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Until quite recently, though, Ms. Henley would have been
forbidden to bring her case. Under a 1987 tort reform law, product
liability suits against tobacco companies were prohibited in
California on the ground that the risks of smoking were universally
known. The law was repealed in 1997, around the time California
decided to file a claim against the tobacco industry in an effort
to recover smoking-related health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   In November, California was one of 46 states that struck a $206
billion deal with Philip Morris and the other major cigarette
makers settling all remaining lawsuits brought to recoup those
costs.

`BLAST' IS AN ENTERTAINING ROMANTIC COMEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If anyone has learned from last year's Valentine's weekend
success of ``The Wedding Singer,'' a lightweight but entertaining
comedy about an unlikely couple, it's New Line Cinema. For this
Valentine's weekend, the studio is giving us ``Blast From the
Past,'' a lightweight but entertaining comedy about an unlikely
couple.
</P>
<P>
   With Brendan Fraser in the lead role, ``Blast'' even vaguely
resembles an Adam Sandler comedy, albeit one that has been to
finishing school. Having played a cave man dealing with modern ways
(''Encino Man'') and a jungle boy dealing with modern ways
(''George of the Jungle''), Fraser now plays a baby boomer dealing
with modern ways. Unlike most boomers, Fraser's too-obviously-named
Adam Webber was born in a fallout shelter, where he spent his first
35 years.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's opening scenes show how this came to pass. In 1962,
Adam's father, Calvin (Christopher Walken, mocking his image the
way he does when he hosts Saturday Night Live), a brilliant
scientist with a heavy case of Cold War paranoia, locks himself and
his pregnant wife, Helen (Sissy Spacek) in his fallout shelter,
believing that the bomb has dropped. Spacek at first seems miscast
as this Harriet Nelson type _ she's too free and quirky an actress
_ but she quickly turns the sitcom stereotype on its head as Helen
becomes less and less enchanted with living underground (let's just
say that she's happy that the shelter's bar is well-stocked).
</P>
<P>
   This is some shelter: Not only does it include a replica of the
Webbers' house, it includes a warehouse with more groceries than
all the Sam's Warehouses put together. The provisions apparently
include contraceptives. The shelter doesn't have that many
distractions, but Adam remains the Webbers' only child.
</P>
<P>
   A series of scenes takes us through Adam's developing years, in
which he learns about baseball, Perry Como, dancing, manners and
self-defense, all of which will serve him well later. We also see
what's happening above ground, where a scungy bar and an adult
bookstore are being built above the shelter. It's no wonder that
when Calvin finally believes it's safe to poke his head outside, he
discovers the worst of the '90s and decides it's safer underground
than in Omega Man territory. But when Calvin suffers a heart
attack, Adam is sent into the big, bad world for supplies (one of
the first things Adam hears is a song by Dishwalla; you'd think
that'd chase him right back underground).
</P>
<P>
   From the time Adam meets the too-obviously-named Eve, a cynical
'90s woman with a heart and a conscience, the movie offers few
surprises, aside from Alicia Silverstone's relatively mature,
self-assured performance as Eve. This is a big step up after 1997's
ugly double whammy of ``Batman and Robin'' and ``Excess Baggage''
(talk about bombs); apparently, Silverstone needed the time off.
</P>
<P>
   But surprise really isn't the point of ``Blast;'' the point is
the comedy that the movie hangs on its formulaic plot line.
Fortunately, the jokes are fairly sharp and well-observed, and Hugh
Wilson's workmanlike direction moves things along nicely. There's
also a well-turned, funny subplot with Joey Slotnick (formerly of
TV's ``The Single Guy'' _ again, talk about bombs) as the bar
owner, who has a particularly '90s reaction when the Webbers begin
emerging from the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Few smart actors enjoy playing dumb as much as Fraser, and his
geniality helps keep the movie's best quality _ its
good-naturedness _ in sync. What's not in sync is the disturbing
way the script never rectifies Calvin's belief that street people
are mutants, or the lazy way it gives Silverstone that thing no
single woman can do without in '90s movies: a gay male friend
(''NewsRadio's'' Dave Foley, back in his ``Kids in the Hall''
mode). The screenplay also loses its way late in the film, when it
decides that it's time to meander its way to a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   In the way it brings Cold War and '90s attitudes together,
``Blast'' is also sort of like ``Pleasantville'' in reverse,

JUDGE GAGS PRESS AT TRIAL OF MALAYSIA'S FORMER DEPUTY PRIME
MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ The judge in the corruption trial of
Malaysia's ousted deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, ruled
Wednesday that the news media could not publish statements made in
court by Anwar about the prime minister or the chief of police.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by Judge Augustine Paul came a day after he declared
that Anwar would not be permitted to introduce evidence of a
political conspiracy as a defense against charges that he abused
his power as deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar, who was ousted and imprisoned in September, contends that
he was driven from office by his political enemies in a campaign
sanctioned by his longtime mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
The government has charged Anwar with having illicit sexual
relations with women and men, and with interfering in a police
investigation of his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that he had put off-limits any discussion of a
conspiracy and that there was no conclusive evidence of the
accusations made by Anwar, Augustine said, ``I will instruct the
press not to publish all this unless it is proven.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge also said he would not allow Anwar's statements to be
admitted as evidence unless the defense lawyers guaranteed that
they would call Mahathir and the police chief, Abdul Rahim Noor, as
witnesses. The lawyers have said they would consider summoning them
to the stand.
</P>
<P>
   News agencies, including Reuters and Agence France-Presse,
reported the testimony before the judge imposed the blackout.
</P>
<P>
   It is the second time that Augustine has imposed a gag order on
coverage of the four-month-long trial, which has galvanized this
country.
</P>
<P>
   In December, he prohibited the news media from publishing
transcripts of audiotapes that the defense asserts show there was a
political conspiracy to remove Anwar from office. The transcripts
of the tapes were widely circulated on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony Wednesday, Anwar denied the main corruption
charge: that he had directed the police to obtain retractions from
two witnesses who signed statements accusing him of sodomy and
sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by his lead lawyer, Anwar also asserted that
Mahathir had played a role in his arrest. He said his relations
with the prime minister had deteriorated because of disagreements
about how Malaysia should respond to the Asian economic crisis.
Anwar testified that he learned Mahathir was involved in a police
investigation of his private life from Rahim.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Anwar's testimony has been widely reported before. For
example, on Sept. 2, Anwar testified, Mahathir gave him an
``ultimatum'' to resign or face charges of sexual misconduct. When
Anwar refused to step down, the prime minister dismissed him later
that day.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's attorney general, Mohtar Abdullah, who is leading the
prosecution, maintained that Anwar should not be allowed to
introduce accusations of a political conspiracy into his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But Anwar argued that conspiracy was the keystone of his
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your Lord, you said don't talk about political conspiracy,''
he said. ``I don't know what to do with my defense. If I can't
refer to these meetings, I am helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Augustine allowed Anwar considerable leeway in his
testimony in the morning session, he returned from lunch in a very
different mood. After he imposed the gag order, lawyers for Anwar
spent the afternoon session seeking clarification on which
testimony it covered.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Alfred E. Mann has founded six companies. He has
pledged $100 million each to the University of Southern California
and the University of California at Los Angeles to build biomedical
research institutes. He has numerous inventions to his credit.
</P>
<P>
   But can he capture the Holy Grail of diabetes monitoring?
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Mann's main company, Minimed Inc., is
scheduled to go before a Food and Drug Administration advisory
panel to seek approval to sell the world's first sensor that
provides continuous measurements of glucose in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, to measure blood sugar, diabetics have to prick a
finger and draw blood several times a day. Minimed says its system
will be less painful and will provide more detailed information,
allowing diabetics to better control their condition and improve
their health.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to change the whole paradigm for diabetes
therapy,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts and physicians say such promises are exaggerated,
arguing that the sensor's probe lasts only three days and will
appeal to only a tiny percentage of diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not deterred Mann, who at 73 puts in 80-hour weeks
at Minimed, two other companies, a nonprofit research foundation,
venture capital activities and the USC and UCLA projects.
</P>
<P>
   The sensor is just a step toward Mann's ultimate goal _ a
mechanical pancreas in which a pump would automatically dispense
the right amount of insulin in response to blood glucose levels
detected by the sensor. ``When you have an automatic system, the
patient won't even know he has a disease,'' said Mann, Minimed's
chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   A prosthetic pancreas still is years away. But the sensor alone
is generating excitement not only among patients and doctors but
among investors. Shares of Minimed have surged from less than $60
in November to $100.25 at Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been jokingly calling it Minimed.com,'' said Melissa
Wilmoth, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, another Minimed
underwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Also helping the stock is the fact that revenues for Minimed's
main business _ selling insulin pumps _ are now growing 50 percent
a year. As the dominant domestic supplier, the company is viewed as
a takeover candidate.
</P>
<P>
   But what the company has going for it most, perhaps, is its
chief.
</P>
<P>
   Mann has spent his career moving from company to company almost
by happenstance. After studying physics at UCLA, he started two
aerospace companies, Spectrolab and Heliotek, which were both sold
to Textron and are now owned by Hughes Electronics, a unit of the
General Motors Corp..
</P>
<P>
   Because of his work making power supplies for satellites,
scientists at Johns Hopkins University asked him in 1969 to work on
longer-lasting batteries for pacemakers. So Mann founded Pacesetter
Systems and introduced rechargeable pacemaker batteries. He sold
the privately-held Pacesetter to Siemens of Germany for $150
million in 1985, without using an investment banker or even telling
his chief financial officer. Pacesetter is now owned by St. Jude
Medical Inc. and is the No. 2 pacemaker supplier, behind Medtronic
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, as head of Pacesetter, Mann was visiting a cardiac ward
at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. His host, the heart
surgeon Dr. Richard B. Shepard, remarked that diabetes seemed to
have contributed to cardiovascular problems in many patients. He
challenged Mann to work on that disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really lit into him,'' recalled Dr. Shepard, who has not
kept up much with Mann recently. Informed of Mann's efforts with
the glucose sensor, Dr. Shepard said: ``He took it to heart. I
didn't realize he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Minimed, which was spun off from Pacesetter in 1985,
Mann started and controls the Advanced Bionics Corp., which makes
implants that allow deaf people to hear, and Medical Research Group
Inc., which is doing research on the artificial pancreas for
Minimed. All the companies are next to one another in Sylmar,
Calif., north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Mann is also chairman of the Southern California Biomedical
Council, a group that is trying to spur greater development of the
biotechnology industry in the Los Angeles area. Not content to wait
for committees, Mann seems to be taking the job into his own hands.
He is working on three new technologies that could spawn three new
companies, associates say. He is also investing in start-ups formed
by others, like CTL Immunotherapies, a Canadian company he is
moving here.
</P>
<P>
   All this, of course, keeps Mann busy. He rarely takes vacations
and says his main hobby is ``designing for fun'' _ not only medical
devices but contraptions like the water-conserving hydraulic gates
at his Los Angeles home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people ask me why I work so hard,'' Mann said. ``I work
so hard because I don't work at all. I play all day.'' He added,
``How can you get more reward than giving somebody his life or
improving his quality of life?''

</P>
<P>
   Still, zeal might not be enough for the glucose sensor.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous companies have promised but failed to deliver sensors
that were painless, continuous or both.
</P>
<P>
   Other competitors are hot on Minimed's tail. Cygnus Inc. of
Redwood City, Calif., hopes to apply to the FDA by June for
permission to sell the Glucowatch, a wristwatch that would take a
glucose reading up to three times an hour. Spectrx Inc. of
Norcross, Ga., also recently demonstrated a continuous sensor,
though an FDA filing is probably at least two years away.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies say that for the vast majority of diabetics,
eliminating the pain of finger pricks is more important than a
continuous glucose reading. Cell Robotics International of
Albuquerque, N.M., and Amira Medical of Scotts Valley, Calif.,
recently won FDA approval for systems that, while not continuous,
are advertised as less painful.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetics either cannot make or cannot properly use insulin, a
hormone produced in the pancreas. Insulin is needed to turn the
sugar in food into energy.
</P>
<P>
   What is driving the quest for better sensors is that a major
clinical trial, completed in 1993, found that diabetics who kept
their blood sugar as close to normal as possible significantly
reduced their risk of complications like blindness, kidney failure
and the need for amputation.
</P>
<P>
   In that trial, patients measured their blood sugar levels four
to seven times a day. But Minimed says that even seven measurements
can fail to detect instances when blood sugar shoots way out of
normal range. Data from the continuous sensor ``will show how
poorly controlled most people with diabetes really are,'' Mann
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors agree. ``People for the first time will have many
readings of their blood sugar,'' said David C. Klonoff, a clinical
professor at the University of California at San Francisco, and
editor of a new journal called ``Diabetes Technology and
Therapeutics.''
</P>
<P>
   With more frequent readings, diabetics could fine-tune their
insulin intake or take other steps like forgoing part of a meal if
they see their glucose level rising.
</P>
<P>
   David Hitchcock, who runs www.childrenwithdiabetes.com, a
diabetes-related Web site, said the main benefit of a continuous
sensor would be the ability to sound an alarm when blood sugar
drops too low, which can cause patients to lose consciousness.
Hitchcock's 11-year-old daughter, Marissa, who has diabetes, now
has to be awakened every night and have her blood sugar tested.
</P>
<P>
   The Minimed sensor uses a replaceable probe to measure glucose
in the fluid directly under the skin, usually in the abdomen. One
question the FDA will consider is whether measurements in this
fluid can adequately substitute for measurements of the blood
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say many diabetics will not want to have anything
permanently attached to them or wear a device that tells the world
they have the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Cygnus Glucowatch, by contrast, sits on top of the skin and
uses tiny electric shocks to open up pores and extract fluid. But
while perhaps more socially acceptable, the Glucowatch has had
development problems, and Becton Dickinson &AMP; Co. last year pulled
out of an agreement to market the device.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts say that relatively few diabetics will be able to
take advantage of the extra information a continuous sensor can
provide. ``It's just overkill,'' said Dr. Xavier Pi-Sunyer, a
professor of medicine at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 1 million of the nation's estimated 16 million
diabetics have Type 1 diabetes, the form that generally requires
insulin injections. Of these, only 20 percent to 30 percent now
intensively regulate their blood sugar levels.
</P>
<P>
   Because of concern that patients might not know how to use so
much data, the first Minimed sensor will not even show glucose
readings. It will store the information to be downloaded later by
doctors for analysis. A second version will sound an alarm for low
glucose levels. If those prove successful, a meter that can be read
by patients would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Similar concerns have hindered the adoption of insulin pumps,
which also require the patient to insert a catheter under the skin
and wear a pager-like device. About 60,000 insulin pumps are now in
use in the United States, representing only about 6 percent of Type
1 diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   But pump use is growing rapidly as many people rave about them.
Nicole Johnson, the current Miss America, wears a Minimed pump.
</P>
<P>
   Minimed, with total sales of $138.6 million last year, dominates
the U.S. pump market with a share above 75 percent. It has only one
competitor, Disetronic Holding AG of Switzerland, which dominates
the European market.
</P>
<P>
   Mann, the son of a grocer, is not used to failure, except
perhaps in music. His brother, Robert, founded the Juilliard
Quartet, and his sister, Rosalind Koff, is a concert pianist. But
Mann's piano is played by a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   He also has failed so far in getting UCLA to accept his $100
million. While USC is moving ahead with its research institute, to
be named for Mann, UCLA and Mann have not agreed on terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't do it by summer, maybe I'll do it with Johns
Hopkins instead,'' Mann said. He said he was considering similar
ventures with Hopkins, Harvard and the University of California at
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole estate will go to these ventures,'' he said, adding
that his six children already ``have enough.'' Fortunately for the
lucky universities, that estate keeps growing. His 34.4 percent of
Minimed alone is now worth about $500 million.

 &HT;    Payne to submit brief report to IOC
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Despite new questions about Atlanta's Olympic bid
effort, Billy Payne's report to the International Olympic Committee
will bear no resemblance to Salt Lake City's 300-page document
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Payne, who headed the volunteer Atlanta Organizing Committee bid
team, has not issued his formal response to the IOC's widening
inquiry into improprieties during the fierce competition among
cities bidding for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   When he does, it will be brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the Atlanta bid group is concerned, we did
everything by the book and therefore have nothing to explain to the
IOC, and therefore the response is brief,'' Lee Echols, the new
spokesman for the bid team, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Echols, who has worked extensively with Atlanta Olympic
co-chairman Andrew Young, former mayor of Atlanta, has been brought
in to field media inquiries as the growing investigation expands to
Atlanta and other cities.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of a memorandum Payne wrote in 1990 to top aide
Ginger Watkins _ suggesting that IOC members be given gifts, some
of them considered excessive in the current climate _ has generated
global interest.
</P>
<P>
   Payne and Echols on Wednesday fielded calls and transmitted a
prepared statement characterizing the memo as musings that never
were acted upon. Payne consistently has denied any wrongdoing in
securing the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The memo was written Aug. 20, 1990, just one month before the
IOC voted in Tokyo to elect Atlanta to host the 1996 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the last-minute inducements suggested in the memo:
</P>
<P>
   _ A tennis scholarship to the University of Georgia for the
daughter of Pal Schmitt, an IOC executive board member.
</P>
<P>
   _ Medical care at the Emory Clinic for Bashir Mohamed
Attarabulsi, the Libyian IOC member who has already resigned.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free airline tickets for two other members interested in
attending an international baseball game in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Schmitt, a Hungarian, said Wednesday he had three college-age
daughters in 1990 but none was offered scholarships to UGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never discussed this with Mr. Payne,'' Schmitt said.
``Perhaps he was thinking that this would be nice, to offer a
scholarship to one of my daughters. I am helpless that I was
mentioned in this.''
</P>
<P>
   One daughter went to school in Hungary, another to the
University of Southern California on a tennis scholarship. The
third did not attend college. Schmitt acknowledged that bid cities
research IOC members to figure out ways to secure their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``They studied us and looked for a weak point to attack, whether
it was health reasons or children or poverty or whatever,'' Schmitt
said. ``Then they thought, 'What could we do to get the favor of
the IOC member?' ``
</P>
<P>
   However, Payne and his team say they never offered inappropriate
favors in exchange for votes.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly the nature of the information being sought by
the IOC. After completing its own investigation of excesses in Salt
Lake City's bid, the IOC announced that it would expand its inquiry
to include every candidate city from 1996 through 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Because most bid committees have disbanded, the IOC sent letters
of inquiry to national Olympic committees. The IOC set a Feb. 15
deadline for response.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hybl, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, received the
request for information about Atlanta's bid and has talked to
Horace Sibley, the bid team's attorney. Sibley, who also was a
member of the volunteer bid team, and Payne are preparing their
response. Payne said he would make his response public when it is
sent to the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC investigators say they want evidence of any
inappropriate requests for material benefits or favors by its
members, multiple visits to candidate cities or excessive gifts
from by bidders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already prepared a brief summary of comments that we
will issue in response to the letter,'' Echols said Wednesday.
``Obviously, we'll need to see the letter first to crystallize our
own response. It'll certainly not be 300 pages like Salt Lake
City's.''
</P>
<P>
   The massive report issued by Salt Lake detailed cash payments, a
bogus scholarship program; expensive travel, including Super Bowl
trips; medical services; gifts and shopping sprees _ all delivered
to IOC members and their families in hopes of winning the 2002
Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt suggested that every bid city undergo the
wrenching self-scrutiny that Salt Lake City has suffered the past
seven weeks. That would help clear a path to setting a new standard
of ``forthrightness'' in the Olympic world, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what happened here was not right,'' Leavitt said. ``So
we're setting it right and we're paving the way for others to do
the same.

JOHN LAMBERT COTTER, ARCHEOLOGIST, DIES AT 87  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Va.)  By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. John Lambert Cotter, an archeologist who dug into America's
ancient and not-so-ancient past, died on Friday at a retirement
residence in Philadelphia. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Cotter retired as curator emeritus from the University of
Pennsylvania Museum of Archeology and Anthropology but kept an
office and regular working hours there until last month.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1930s he headed a team from the Academy of Natural
Sciences in Philadelphia that dug up weapons and tools used 11,000
years ago by the earliest humans known to have been in North
America, Paleo-Amerindians, at a site in New Mexico. More recently
he explored the origins of Philadelphia and Jamestown, Va., the
first permanent English settlement in America.
</P>
<P>
   Cotter wrote ``Archeological Excavations at Jamestown Virginia''
(University of Pennsylvania Press, revised, 1994) and was co-author
of ``The Buried Past: An Archaeological History of Philadelphia''
(University of Pennsylvania Press, 1992) and ``Walnut Street Prison
Workshop'' (Athenaeum, 1988). All three remain in print.
</P>
<P>
   He contributed more than 200 articles and reviews to
professional journals, beginning in 1937. Among his many honors was
the 1978 David E. Finley Award for Outstanding Achievement from the
National Trust for Historic Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Cotter, who was born in Denver, graduated in anthropology from
the University of Denver in 1934. He received a master's degree in
anthropology there in 1935 and a doctorate in the same discipline
at the University of Pennsylvania in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 37 years with the agency, the last four as head
archeologist of the Colonial National Historic Park at Jamestown.
He joined the Penn faculty in 1960, initially as an adjunct
professor, having been sent to Philadelphia to plan and start
archeological projects at Independence National Historical Park.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the university's department of American
civilization, he taught that subject and introduced a novel course
in American historical archeology. He was curator for American
historical archeology at the Museum of Archeology and Anthropology
from 1971 to 1980, when he took emeritus status.
</P>
<P>
   Cotter is survived by his wife of 58 years, Virginia Tomlin
Cotter; a son, Laurence T., of Albuquerque, N.M.; a daughter, Jean
C. Spaans of Montgomery Village, Md., and three grandsons.

SENATORS DISPLAY A FACT OF HUMAN NATURE: THE NEED TO TALK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa, Miss., N.Y., R.I., Vt., Colo.)  (See related stories: IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-DEBATE,

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Drifting through the official silence of the
impeachment trial, individual senators on Wednesday began
exhibiting traits of adaptability worthy of Galapagos tortoises
maneuvering for scraps of sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   With Darwinian aplomb, some spoke out to reporters in the subway
tunnel under the Capitol as they hurried to and from the trial,
making some points about their task even as they disowned any
intention of prejudgment. A few dared to be more direct and go on
television to pre-empt the momentous event of verdict-casting day
later this week.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, they exhibited the invincible human dynamic that
did so much to drive the presidential sex-and-mendacity scandal to
the extreme of impeachment _the simple fact that people will talk;
there can be no true silencing of them, a senator no more than a
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   At its most controversial, this quality was exhibited by Sen.
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who openly rebelled against the trial's
closed-door deliberations by leaving the chamber to deliver his
speech for acquittal even before he read it to the Senate court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the sordid affair of all sordid affairs,'' said the
senator, denouncing the House Republican prosecutors for a
political ``counterfeit case.'' His passion hinted at the kind of
clash the nation might have witnessed if deliberations were open
when he scored the investigative behavior of Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, even more than the misbehavior of President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., later railed against
Harkin for the implicit insult of opting for television exposure to
the Senate court's ongoing deliberations. But through the day there
seemed no stopping the basic urge of elected senators to reach the
people: One by one, press releases leafed forth announcing
positions of individual senators. A second, then a third, followed
by a fourth senator went on television with their positions rather
than risk being lost in the mass of verdict statements on the final
day.
</P>
<P>
   Down in the Capitol tunnel, one of the alternative forums of
choice, senators made some interesting points even if they did not
formally announce their votes. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, worried
about how any senator voting against perjury for good lawyerly
reasons could explain that to the average voter who remembers the
finger-wagging denial of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a simple common-sense standpoint, if there's anything out
there that's clear to the people it's that the president wagged his
finger at 'em a year ago and he actually lied,'' said Grassley,
heading for the trial. ``People back home might throw up their arms
and say, ``Why, ye gods, of all the things we know the president
did, he lied.'''
</P>
<P>
   The senator took this problem with him back into the trial as
the Senate doors closed once more, interrupting the scraps of
debate to be heard increasingly in the corridors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be saying this in my, uh ...'' began Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., during a recess, catching himself before providing
his undelivered trial speech. ``Let's say one of the things I'm
contemplating,'' he began again, finding safety in more general
language.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those who came forward on television displayed the problem any
senator will have in trying to discuss a verdict with any sense of
mastery in the face of the mass of confusing scandal details
constituents have been exposed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a murky area,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.,
pondering the Lewinsky gifts returned to the president as he
explained his vote before the cameras. He tried to take evidence
disputes in series. ``Now what about the suggestion of coaching?''
he went on. But before long, whether in mercy or despair, the
plainspoken lawmaker dropped the role of senatorial Hercule Poirot,
announcing, ``I'm going to skip,'' and cutting to the meat of his
decision to acquit.
</P>
<P>
   Another senator for acquittal, James Jeffords, R-Vt., was a
belt-and-suspenders man, issuing a detailed printed statement and
also going on television to broadcast his acquittal decision.
Speaking as a former prosecutor, he offered the most blunt opinion
of the day on the perjury article: ``Get out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Those scratching around for post-impeachment hope in the Capitol
could stroll just a half-block to the House side of the building,
tracing the sound of happy laughter emanating from the Rules
Committee room. A simple ice cream party was under way as a welcome
from the new chairman, David Dreier, R-Calif. ``A new phase of
civility,'' said Dreier amid colored balloons and an assortment of
ice creams and sorbets that seemed a world away from high crimes
and misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Down in the Capitol tunnel that senators use to reach their
offices, Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., hurried past with
the latest intelligence from the closed trial: ``Most people want
to get it over with and get out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., would entertain no questions about
his verdict. But as the Senate elevator doors closed on him, he did
accept a question on when the impeachment ordeal will end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope in my lifetime,'' his reply rang out.

U.S. JETS ATTACK IRAQI TARGETS AFTER BAGHDAD VIOLATES ZONE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (jw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a weeklong lull in the fighting, American and
British warplanes attacked air-defense sites in Iraq on Wednesday
after three waves of Iraqi MIG jets flew deep into the no-flight
zone over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The American and British jets made no effort to pursue the Iraqi
jets, which quickly retreated. Instead, they struck six targets
linked to two separate antiaircraft sites in southern Iraq, defense
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, the officials said, were in keeping with the
Pentagon's new, more aggressive strategy to allow pilots, when
provoked, to attack any military target, not just those that
threaten them directly.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's official news agency reported that ``criminal enemy
bombing'' killed one civilian and wounded several others, but
Pentagon officials said they could not confirm that. Iraq has in
the past issued casualty assertions that were false, although in
one instance last month, the Pentagon acknowledged that an American
missile had gone astray and struck a residential neighborhood. Iraq
said that that strike killed 11 people, but U.S. officials said
they could not confirm that information.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's strikes were the first in eight days. Foul weather
had limited patrols in the no-flight zones, which the United States
and its allies created after the 1991 Persian Gulf war to protect
rebellious ethnic groups in the north and south. The United States
and Britain also curtailed flights over the weekend, out of respect
for King Hussein of Jordan, who died on Sunday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's strikes, six American F-15E's and four British
GR-1 Tornado jets attacked a surface-to-air missile-launcher near
the city of Tallil, as well as radar and other air-defense sites
there and near An Najaf.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Joseph LaMarca, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command,
which oversees American forces in the region, said the jets
appeared to have hit each of the six targets they attacked.
</P>
<P>
   None of the sites had threatened the American or British pilots,
either by opening fire or using their radar to track their jets, he
said. Under the more aggressive strategy, the allied pilots are now
patrolling with potential targets already in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we know and we look at different targets that we
would strike ahead of time,'' LaMarca said in a telephone interview
from the Central Command's headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi incursions fit a pattern of defiance by Saddam
Hussein, the Iraqi president, who vowed to challenge foreign
control of Iraqi after the American and British strikes on Iraq in
December.
</P>
<P>
   The jets _ Soviet-made MIG-23s and MIG-25s _ penetrated as many
as 60 miles into the southern no-flight zone. Iraqi jets also flew
into the northern zone Wednesday, but that did not prompt
retaliatory strikes.

 &HT;    Judge orders American Airlines pilots to ground sickout
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston and Gary Hendricks
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A federal judge bluntly ordered American Airlines
pilots to stop a five-day sickout that grounded 1,000 flights and
disrupted travel to major cities.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall in Dallas issued sarcastic
comments Wednesday along with an order for pilots to resume both
normal work schedules and talks with management over how to absorb
pilots from recently acquired Reno Air.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you would look up bad labor relations in the dictionary,
you would have an American Airlines logo beside it,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   When lawyers for American's pilot union argued there was no
``clear proof'' the union orchestrated the sick-out, Kendall
replied, ``Are you actually telling me all these pilots are really
sick? Have you notified the Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta?''
</P>
<P>
   Pilot union President Rich Lavoy said he had no way to predict
how many pilots will return to work or how soon, but he added the
union won't appeal the order.
</P>
<P>
   The sickouts forced Fort Worth, Texas-based American to cancel
44 percent of its flights. The effect was evident at Hartsfield
International Airport, even though American handles only 2 percent
of the traffic there.
</P>
<P>
   The line at American's ticket counter snaked almost out the door
at one point Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Turner of Chicago had been told by American he could
catch a connecting flight in Atlanta to Rio de Janeiro if he left
home at 5:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to leave my house eight hours early to just to get
here,'' Turner said. When he got to Atlanta, he found out his
American connection was canceled. Eventually he was booked on the
Brazilian carrier Varig.
</P>
<P>
   ``Varig. Is that a good airline?'' he asked as he headed for the
gates. ``I've never heard of them.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman yelled obscenities before leaving the ticket counter
in frustration. But most quietly bided their time, hoping the
airline would fix its mess or get them a seat on another carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines, which handles 80 percent of the traffic at
Hartsfield, said seats on flights to Miami and Dallas, which are
American hubs, were especially high in demand.
</P>
<P>
   The job action began Saturday after the sides failed to settle
pay and job issues linked to the Reno Air deal.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during Wednesday's hearing, Kendall called a
two-hour break and invited the two sides to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem to me like a bunch of grown-up people with
cumulative IQs couldn't sit down and figure this out without
disrupting several hundred thousand people,'' the judge said.

ECONOMIC SCENE: THINKING TWICE ABOUT TAX BREAKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Ga.)   By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Democrats, trying to blunt furious tax cutting by
Republicans, are flocking to limited tax proposals aimed at
promoting individual saving.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's budget proposes tax subsidies to underwrite
the cost of setting up private accounts for workers. Sen. Robert C.
Torricelli, D-N.J., this week proposed, along with Sen. Paul D.
Coverdell, R-Ga., tax breaks on interest, dividends and capital
gains. Though politically deft, these plans are economically
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The administration hopes its plan will deflect attention away
from Republican proposals to create private retirement accounts as
part of Social Security and to achieve a huge 10 percent
across-the-board tax cut. Large tax cuts, say the Democrats, are
fiscally reckless because budget surpluses are only temporary
Besides, the Democrats argue, across-the-board tax cuts only sound
fair. Instead, they overwhelmingly reward the high-income families
who pay the bulk of taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But if tax-subsidized savings accounts are a sound political
device, they are a shaky economic device. Clinton's plan purports
to increase the savings of America's many nonsaving families, but
no one knows how to make the idea work in practice. Sen.
Torricelli's plan, many economists argue, would provide little more
than a consumption holiday for higher-income families and do
virtually nothing to achieve its stated goal of rebuilding the
nation's low savings rate.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jonathan Skinner of Dartmouth College, whose research backs
the use of targeted tax breaks to increase savings, describes the
Torricelli-Coverdell plan as the ``wrong means to achieve a
laudable goal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the personal savings rate is pathetically
low, hovering in recent months around zero. Low personal savings
pose two important threats.
</P>
<P>
   For the economy at large, a low savings rate can lead to a low
investment rate, leaving the future economy bereft of the
factories, equipment and technologies it needs to create high-wage
jobs. Low wages would intensify the burden on workers of supporting
the growing ranks of retirees. But Skinner warns that tax-based
savings incentives can do little to solve this problem.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, he says, what would happen if, magically, tax
subsidies encouraged every household to save an additional $1,000.
Under that implausibly rosy scenario, national savings would rise
by about $100 billion, or 1.5 percent of aggregate income. That,
says Skinner, would ``hardly make a dent in returning the personal
savings rate to around 7 percent, the level it hit in the 1970s.''
</P>
<P>
   The second problem posed by low saving rates is distributional.
Half the population lacks an employer-based pension plan. Perhaps
40 percent have no financial assets to fall back on during
retirement. Skinner points to studies that show for many of these
families, consumption plummets by 40 or 50 percent once they
retire.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan does at least address the plight of low-saving
families with modest incomes. He would create $100 savings accounts
for workers. In addition, the government would match a portion of
each extra dollar that workers voluntarily add to these savings
accounts. Low-income families would receive a higher government
contribution than would middle-income families.
</P>
<P>
   William Gale of the Brookings Institution applauds its
potential. ``One hundred dollars invested every year for, say, 40
years could amount to $10,000 by the time a worker retires,'' Gale
said. ``If the worker contributes another $100, matched by
government, the nest egg at retirement could total $30,000.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gale warns against undue optimism. How would the government
prevent families from borrowing on their credit cards to deposit
money into the tax-advantaged accounts? Would Congress let people
invade their retirement accounts for pressing needs like a medical
catastrophe or college tuition? If so, would retirement saving rise
at all, or would the proposal act as a trigger for one claim after
another on the accounts, including the money the government
contributed? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's worse, Torricelli's proposal shows how quickly the
impulse to subsidize savings can go haywire. The plan, among other
things, would provide a tax exemption for the first $500 of
interest and dividend earnings and for the first $5,000 of capital
gains.
</P>
<P>
   But Alan Auerbach, a professor at the University of California
at Berkeley, says it would backfire. The plan cuts taxes on the
initial amounts of interest, dividends and capital gains that
people earn. In other words, it rewards families for their existing
levels of saving.
</P>
<P>
   But because the tax savings do not rise as interest, dividend
and capital gains earnings rise, the proposal does nothing to
persuade people to save more than they already are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The full benefit of the Torricelli plan goes only to those
above the 15 percent bracket and who already have substantial
investment earnings,'' Auerbach said. ``Those least in need would
benefit the most.'' &QL;

RULING BY APPEALS COURT THROWS FUTURE OF MIRANDA IN DOUBT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ariz., Md., S.C., N.C. W.Va.) (nk) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sat there unused by prosecutors for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, a law passed by Congress in 1968 was dusted off
by a federal appeals court in Virginia and used to declare that
federal law enforcement officials need not follow one of the best
known Supreme Court decisions of this century, Miranda vs. Arizona,
under which criminal suspects are routinely read their rights
everywhere in America.
</P>
<P>
   From coast to coast Wednesday, prosecutors, defense lawyers and
legal experts said the ruling provided the most serious challenge
to the Miranda ruling since it was issued in 1966, and opened an
unexpected debate about one of this country's bedrock legal rules.
Over the last three decades, ``Miranda'' has become part of the
language and its ``you have the right'' warning is one the most
familiar incantations of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   The court in Richmond, Va., held on Monday that Congress
overruled the 1966 Miranda decision in the 1968 law that sought to
make it easier for federal prosecutors to use confessions that are
given willingly. The Justice Department has never enforced that law
and now argues that it was unconstitutional. But the court in
Richmond, which has a reputation as one of the most conservative in
the country, dismissed that position as political.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, we are a court of law and not politics,'' said
the opinion by a three judge panel in which one judge dissented.
The ruling came about not because of an argument made by the
government, but by private conservative organizations that filed
friend-of-the-court briefs.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the decision would almost certainly be
reviewed by the full 13-member 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
in Richmond, and could lead to a reconsideration by the Supreme
Court of its famous 1966 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sets the stage for a significant Supreme Court decision
revisiting the status of Miranda,'' said A.E. Dick Howard, a
professor of constitutional law at the University of Virginia.
``The case presents squarely what, 33 years later, we think of
Miranda.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1968 law, part of a crime control bill, said that a
confession ``shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily
given.'' Many legal scholars say that Congress meant to have
federal courts decide simply whether a confession was voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda's requirement that suspects be told their rights has
been interpreted to apply both to federal and state law enforcement
officials. But the 1968 law only applied to federal prosecutors. As
a result, the decision on Monday, if it stands, would apply only to
federal cases in the five states governed by the Richmond court:
Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   State law enforcement officials in those states and elsewhere
are unaffected by the ruling, and Miranda warnings are to remain
standard practice unless the Supreme Court retreats from its 1966
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the states governed by the Richmond court, it was
unclear Wednesday whether federal prosecutors would follow the
panel's ruling. A few federal prosecutors in those states tried in
recent years to advance the argument made by the court in its
Monday ruling. But those prosecutors were directed by Justice
Department officials in Washington to follow the Miranda decision
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials declined to comment on the case and it was
unclear whether they would direct federal prosecutors to disregard
the panel's decision while it is being appealed.
</P>
<P>
   The popular mythology is that many guilty people go free because
of the technical requirements of the Miranda decision. Academics
have disagreed for years, though, about whether statistics prove or
disprove that belief. Because the Miranda ruling was one of the
landmarks of liberal judicial attitudes that shaped much of the
country's law in recent decades, the reactions to Monday's decision
were shaped by political perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives generally applauded it as an overdue limitation on
what some of them saw as excesses in favor of defendants. Some
conservatives have long argued that the Supreme Court merely meant
to state guidelines in its Miranda decision, not to lay down a
constitutional rule that would have a substantial impact on the
system.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is important because Congress would likely not
have had the power to overrule the Miranda ruling in 1968 if it had
been viewed as having established new constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miranda was not a constitutional requirement,'' said Douglas
W. Kmiec, a conservative constitutional expert at Pepperdine
University Law School. ``It was instead a constitutional
suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberals and defense lawyers Wednesday said the Miranda ruling
did establish new constitutional rights that could not be revoked
by the Congress in 1968. The decision by the Richmond court, some
of them said, would roll back what they view as important progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a decision as a society that the ends don't justify
the means,'' said Larry S. Pozner, president of the National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ``This says, `Forget about
protecting the individual.' I think its very frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cole, an expert on criminal law at Georgetown University
Law Center said: ``The decision takes away from suspects in federal
cases the right to know their rights and it resurrects the inherent
coersion of the interrogation setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberals have long said that police powers were so intimidating
that it was often difficult to tell before the Miranda ruling
whether a confession was truly voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has repeatedly undercut the strength of its
own Miranda ruling over the years by saying in later decisions that
Miranda warnings were merely ``prophylactic'' and ``not themselves
rights protected by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas have
suggested they might be sympathetic to the argument that the 1968
law overruled Miranda's application in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department has been unwilling to make the
argument challenging the Miranda decision. In part, legal experts
say, that has been because law enforcement officials have been
divided about whether it would be useful to do away with the
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   There are cases in which guilty people go free because their
confessions cannot be used. But some law enforcement officials have
also said the clear requirement to give a warning has been
incorporated into police work. Some prosecutors say the Miranda
rule benefits them because confessions are routinely admitted if it
is established that a suspect was read the statement of rights.
</P>
<P>
   But for some conservatives the Miranda ruling remains
philosophically troubling. For them, it was also troubling that
prosecutors declined to use the 1968 law even though its
application could have helped win convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The case decided on Monday involved a Maryland man, Charles T.
Dickerson, who confessed to a series of bank robberies. A district
court judge ruled that he confessed voluntarily but that he was not
read his rights until after he confessed. The district court ruled
the confession could not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Under directives from the Justice Department, local federal
prosecutors did not make the argument that Miranda had been
invalidated by the 1968 law. But two groups, the Washington Legal
Foundation and the Safe Streets Coalition, filed
friend-of-the-court briefs making those claims.
</P>

<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, R. Shawn Gunnarson, senior counsel at
the Washington Legal Foundation, acknowledged that his
organization, which he described as a conservative law and policy
group, had selected the 4th Circuit to test the legal issue partly
because of its reputation as a conservative court. ``The 4th
Circuit,'' he said, ``is a very careful Circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts said Wednesday that the panel's ruling was
weakened because the court did not fully consider both sides of the
argument. The panel's decision said the Justice Department at first
took no position and then argued that the 1968 law was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's decision, written by Judge Karen J. Williams, said
the Justice Department had been ``elevating politics over law'' by
prohibiting the local federal prosecutor from arguing that the 1968
law would have permitted Dickerson's confession to be admissible.
Williams was appointed by President George Bush. A federal district
judge sitting by designation, Jackson L. Kiser, appointed by
President Ronald Reagan, joined in the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   A judge appointed by President Clinton, M. Blane Michael,
dissented from the part of the decision dealing with the Miranda
case. He said he saw no evidence that seven consecutive
administrations since the enactment of the 1968 law were acting
because of politics.
</P>
<P>
   The dissent noted that Williams' ruling concluded that the
Miranda decision did not amount to a rule of constitutional rights.
``I don't know whether it is or not,'' Michael said, ``but before I
decide, I would want thoughtful lawyers on both sides to answer one
question for me. If Miranda is not a constitutional rule, why does
the Supreme Court continue to apply it in prosecutions arising in
state courts?''
</P>
<P>
   H. Richard Uviller, a professor of criminal law at Columbia Law
School, was one of several experts who said Wednesday that the
decision on Monday could force the courts to decide whether the
Miranda ruling created constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the familiar warnings were to fade from American
life, Uviller said, the effect of the Miranda ruling's broad
message protecting the rights of citizens would not quickly
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miranda,'' Uviller said, ``is part of a group if cases that
have shaped our historic view of ourselves. And I don't think any
decision will just wipe that away.''

<P>
   MIAMI _ In a classroom of newly arrived Cubans, Alex Alvarez, a
Cuban transplant himself, wasted no time recently scaring his
students straight. ``Welcome to the capitalist system,'' he said.
``Each one of you is responsible for the amount of money you have
in your pocket. The government is not responsible for whether you
eat or whether you're poor or rich. The government doesn't
guarantee you a job or a house.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've come to a rich and powerful country, but it is up to
you whether or not you continue living like you did in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Such warnings were not necessary 40 years ago, when Cubans
fleeing Fidel Castro settled down here to await _ some to plot _
his downfall. They came from a capitalist system, with enough
education and the necessary ambition to fulfill the American dream.
But Castro has lasted so long that Miami now reflects different
Cubas.
</P>
<P>
   The people from today's Cuba, the children of the revolution,
include those filling out job applications in Alvarez's class at
the Training and Employment Council of South Florida, where he
admonishes them, ``Put down `High School, Havana, Cuba.' Do not
write `Secundaria Ho Chi Minh.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The people from an earlier Cuba and their children have grown
into a Miami Who's Who. The mayors of the city and county of Miami,
the county police chief and the county state attorney are all
Cuban-born or of Cuban descent. So are the president of the largest
bank, the owner of the largest real estate developer, the managing
partner of the largest law firm, nearly half of the county's
27-member delegation in the state Legislature and two of its six
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   About the only accomplishment Cuban-Americans cannot claim is
regaining their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an irony and pathos about the situation,'' a
University of Miami sociologist and expert on Cuban affairs, Max
Castro, said. ``They have succeeded as immigrants and failed as
exiles.''
</P>
<P>
   That success and failure is etched on Miami, the main repository
of Cuban dreams and dissent in the United States, where the news
one day can be about the welcoming of a Cuban-American company's
shares to the New York Stock Exchange and the next day about the
arrest of four aging exiles embarking on a mission to assassinate
Castro.
</P>
<P>
   But immigration over the decades has made Miami so distinctly
Cuban that the cultural clash is no longer between Cubans and
Americans as much as between different waves of Cuban immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   With each batch of immigrants who win the annual visa lottery
and with each smuggled boatload of Cubans that land almost daily in
South Florida, Cuban Miami becomes less cohesive, encompassing a
people who differ in social class, race, generation and politics,
and who increasingly come from different worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The first and latest waves of Cubans, particularly, said a
sociologist at the University of Michigan, Silvia Pedraza, ``live
side by side but remain aloof from one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently the federal government had an open door policy
for Cuban immigrants, welcoming them as victims of communism. They
still get special treatment. Each year, 20,000 Cubans are granted
visas by lot. Many of those who make it here illegally are allowed
to stay. Unlike many other immigrants, Cubans meeting certain
criteria are also eligible for government acculturation classes and
welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants from Cuba still count on welcoming relatives like
Efrain Veiga, who left Cuba as a child in 1962 and now, at 47, is
the successful owner of Yuca, a restaurant in Miami Beach. Veiga
has visited Cuba twice and regularly sends money to relatives
there.
</P>
<P>
   But even Veiga was startled by his latest experience with a
cousin, whom he had helped leave the island, put up in his home
here and given a job in his restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Veiga said he was surprised when his cousin balked at working
weekends. The restaurant owner was outright shocked, he said, when
one of his waiters showed up for work one day wearing a pair of
expensive shoes he had given his cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did you get those shoes?'' Veiga asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your cousin sold them to me,'' the waiter replied.
</P>
<P>
   Veiga has hired other newcomers from Cuba and found many of them
also stuck in the day-to-day survival mode of modern Cuba, where
trading shoes for dollars could mean food on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their lifestyle and way of thinking are different,'' Veiga
said. ``Deep down they feel we owe them something, that we've had
it better.''
</P>
<P>
   The shock is mutual. Students in Alvarez's class said one of
their biggest surprises in the United States was how hard people
work. Another is how ``Americanized'' their compatriots have
become, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so materialistic,'' said Olga Rodriguez, 40, who
came legally last year with a 22-year-old son and 15-year-old
daughter. ``It's like they have the dollar sign on their forehead.
It hasn't happened to me yet. I offer rides to classmates in
language school even if I have to go out of my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Marquez, 30, arrived in the United States after a year
in refugee camps in Panama and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Only one of
several distant relatives offered to put him up when he finally got
here in 1995, and then only for two weeks. He said no thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think we all steal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez, a painter and sculptor who sold his art on the streets
of Havana, said his relatives had also painted too rosy a picture
of life here. ``I thought that this was a wonderland, that you'd
kick a rock and money would fall out,'' he said. Instead, he has
bounced from job to job and now works as a busboy in a Boca Raton
beach club while struggling to start a pest control business.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez does not regret leaving Cuba, and if the experience of
most of those who came before him is any guide, he, too, will make
it. Cuba, however, still has the pull of the 7-year-old daughter
and a brother. He calls them both, sends clothes when he can and
plans to visit them once he becomes an American citizen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not political, but from a human standpoint, they're
killing of hunger the people, not Fidel,'' he said, explaining why
he opposed the American trade embargo of Cuba. ``People here think
that in Cuba a group could get organized to take Fidel out. That's
really easy to say with a full stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that many older exiles have lost touch, living off
memories that may or may not be accurate. But full stomachs have
not tempered the craving for their homeland of those who settled
here in the 1960s, fleeing the radicalization of the island and
fearing political persecution and Communist indoctrination of their
children. They have recreated a pre-revolution Cuba here, renaming
streets after Cuban martyrs, reactivating Cuban social clubs, trade
organizations and businesses, filling supermarket shelves with
``Cubano'' versions of coffee, cheese and bread.
</P>
<P>
   In this parallel Cuban universe, Jose Lopez-Silvero, 78, and
Alfredo Blanco, 80, president and vice president of the Sugar
Producers of Cuba Inc., which represents those whose companies were
nationalized by the Castro regime, can say exactly how much their
former sugar mills are producing today, how much the mills' workers
earn. They have not seen Cuba since they left in 1960, but their
information is all first-hand, gleaned from recent arrivals and
letters from Cuba. Their ties, while no longer familial, remain
emotional.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The sugar producers want to recover their nationalized
properties, which had been with some families for generations and
which they regard as stolen. Their group also has a plan for
restoring the sugar industry to its past glory in ``post-Communist
Cuba,'' one of many reconstruction plans hatched all over Miami for
the moment Cuba gains its ``freedom,'' as if Castro's four-decade
rule has been just a temporary setback, a bad dream.
</P>
<P>
   In their long exile, Blanco, still a sugar trader and sugar
company executive, and Lopez-Silvero, a retired corporate legal
consultant, have supported the 37-year-old American embargo. They
blame its failure to induce democratic change in Cuba on past
Soviet subsidies and what they deem lax enforcement of its toughest
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   They have seen change come close _ before the Bay of Pigs
invasion failed, after the Berlin wall fell _ only to be let down.
Now, they say, it is only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Castro has to die some day,'' said Blanco, who is eight years
older than the ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the early immigrants' children, however, are not waiting
to get a first-hand taste of Cuba. Fed by their parents' nostalgia,
aided by contacts allowed with Cuba, driven more by curiosity than
patriotism, they help fill clubs that feature Cuban bands from the
island and the charter flights to Havana that leave several times a
week from Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Blanco, 30, a civil engineer born in Madrid to Cuban
exiles and raised in Miami, visited Cuba in 1994 for the first
time. He said the country did not deviate much from the
descriptions he had heard growing up, ``except for the poverty,''
and he felt totally at ease. Last year he published a book of poems
that laid out some of the feelings of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years they have come for you, awkward-size envelopes
labeled `Por Avion,' '' reads one poem. ``Monthly, you would peel
eggshell pages, the white onionskin paper telling details: Kiki's
first steps, your mother's death, dates approximated by the
postmarks. Sometimes with pictures: mute black and whites, poor
photos of poor cousins I would handle looking for my resemblance in
the foreign image of an ear, an eyebrow, or a nose.''
</P>
<P>
   While Miami's Cuban population evolves with American-born
generations and newcomers, other demographic forces at work are
changing the face of Hispanic Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Cubans are still the single largest Latin American group, making
up about 60 percent of the total Hispanic population, which
accounts for more than half of Miami-Dade County's population. But
while the Cuban influx was accompanied by the flight of local
whites, it coincided with the arrival of other Hispanic immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin Americanization of Miami is slowly chipping away at
the dominant Cuban identity. In Little Havana, storefronts
advertise Salvadoran corn pancakes and waitresses hail from
Honduras and Peru; on the radio, only one of three stations
continue its Cuba-oriented talk and the area's highest-rated
Spanish-language station is Colombian.
</P>
<P>
   But if the tone is less virulent and the voices more diverse,
prompting moderate and liberal Cuban-Americans to come out in the
open, Miami's political discourse and much of the media coverage is
still largely defined by hard-edge conservatism. At times the city
has the feel of a bubble suspended in time, where issues are
debated as if Castro had just taken over, where ``communist'' is
still the ultimate insult.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown that a majority of Cubans here oppose even
beginning a political dialogue with the Cuban government while
Castro remains in power, a position zealously guarded by
Cuban-Americans whose influence in Washington was personified by
the founder of the Cuban American National Foundation, the late
Jorge Mas Canosa, a man whom presidents consulted on policy toward
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   That unwavering stance, coupled with an image of political
intolerance and violent episodes of right-wing extremism, has won
the exiles little international sympathy. Castro, some political
experts say, has proved far more shrewd at public relations than
his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seen as a narrow-minded,'' Castro, the University of
Miami sociologist, said. ``The one political success has been to
turn U.S. policy in a hard-line direction, and that hasn't worked
because it has the negative connotation that it hurts Cuban
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans like Bill Teck, editor of the magazine
``Generation N,'' a term applied to bicultural Hispanics members of
Generation X, said his readers and employees differ on Cuba policy
issues but share a frustration that so many see Cuba through a
romantic prism, blind to its political prisoners, its lack of
democratic elections, its human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we talk about is the failure of the cause of a free Cuba
to permeate the pop culture,'' said Teck, who was born here to an
American father and a Cuban mother.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE - OPTIONAL MATERIALS FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But among the younger generations, the conservative message has
become less strident.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Penelas, the Miami-born, 37-year-old mayor of Miami-Dade
County and an ambitious politician many here expect to someday run
for president, has inherited the conservatism of his parents. His
father narrowly escaped a death sentence for plotting against
Castro in 1960, he said; Penelas never met his paternal
grandfather, who died in Cuba, and he blames Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not convinced of this generational gap people talk
about,'' said the mayor, who is fluent in both English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of his elders, however, Penela has bicultural
sensibilities. He said he would not have snubbed Nelson Mandela for
his friendship with Castro, as Miami's Cuban leadership did when
the South African leader visited here in 1990. The incident, which
included the withdrawal of an official welcoming proclamation,
prompted a three-year black tourism boycott of Miami-Dade County
and worsened feelings of alienation among blacks here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have met him, given him the proclamation and used the
opportunity'' to give Mandela his opinion of Castro, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And although he has lobbied for traditional Cuban-American
causes like the embargo, he has also reached out to black
constituents, championed gay rights and taken up the concerns of
the numerous ethnic groups who now call Miami home.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba still beckons, however. Penelas envisions ``migration
challenges'' from the island when the Communist Party loosens its
grip on the island, as Cubans here expect after Castro dies. But he
also sees an economic bonanza for Miami in trade and tourism if the
embargo is lifted.
</P>
<P>
   He also expects to play some role in Cuba's transition to
democracy, plans that are shared by many other Cuban-Americans and
that some predict will create new conflict as a post-Castro Cuba is
reshaped. But like most Cuban-Americans, naturalized or native
born, he would stay put in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 30 percent of the about 600,000 Cuban-Americans here
would move to the island, polls show. This is where more than half
of all Cubans in the United States have chosen to live, where the
old have doctors, pensions and offspring and where the young find
opportunity and their own roots.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, after all, is home.

SENATE PANEL AMENDS SCHOOL SOCIAL PROMOTION BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A bill aimed at curbing social promotion in
Texas schools sailed through the Senate Education Committee on
Wednesday, but not before it was amended to make enforcement
contingent on ``sufficient'' funding from the state.
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted 9-0 to send Senate Bill 1 to the full
Senate, although sponsor Sen. Teel Bivins, the committee chair,
acknowledged that Gov. George W. Bush may not be happy with the
amendment's vague wording. The amendment does not define what
constitutes ``sufficient'' funding.
</P>
<P>
   Social promotion is the practice of moving schoolchildren ahead
in grade levels despite their failure to master lower-level
academic material.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we continue to let this happen, then it is we who are
failing, not the students,'' said Bivins, R-Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, public schoolchildren in grades three, five and
eight could be held back in school if they cannot pass Texas
Assessment of Academic Skills tests in reading. Fifth-graders also
would have to pass TAAS tests in math, and eighth-graders would
have to pass additional exams in math and writing.
</P>
<P>
   But under the amendment offered by Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas,
students, teachers and school districts would not be held
accountable under the law if the Legislature does not adequately
fund it.
</P>
<P>
   West said too often the Legislature ``sends a bunch of money''
in the first biennium of a new program, only to shift funding to
local levels in subsequent budget cycles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the intent of the state of Texas to make it (anti-social
promotion programs) a priority in perpetuity,'' he said. If future
legislative sessions fail to continue financial support, he said,
the message should then be ``the Legislature ... is supportive of
social promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Bill Ogden, R-Bryan, and Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound,
voted against the amendment because of the vague wording. Ogden
said it would lead to interminable lawsuits, but Bivins said he
would work with West on language that would set objective measures
for determining sufficient funding levels.
</P>
<P>
   As for rushing it through committee with the vague wording on
funding, he said he did so ``probably because of my ego.'' The bill
is his top priority this session and a unanimous committee vote was
important to him.
</P>
<P>
   He said the bill will be debated next week on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The bill emphasizes early detection of reading problems,
beginning in kindergarten, and intensive instruction for those with
problems. The measure also would require that students be given at
least three opportunities to pass the TAAS test before being
subjected to possible retention in their grade level. An appeals
committee consisting of the child's parent, teacher and principal
or principal's designee could promote a student despite repeated
failures on the TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   All the major educators' organizations representing teachers,
administrators and school boards testified in favor of the bill, as
did several school superintendents and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Al Kauffman of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education
Fund was one of the few voices in opposition to SB 1. He said the
proposal places too much emphasis on one test and would
discriminate against ethnic minorities and poor students, who
historically have scored lower on the TAAS than white students and
those from high-income homes. He also told lawmakers that the
appeals committee process is inadequate and that teachers and
principals would feel pressured to hold students back, given the
high priority the governor and key lawmakers have placed on the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   A key component in making the anti-social promotion bill work,
lawmakers and educators said, is getting teachers trained to detect
and correct reading problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has set aside about $200 million in his budget to fund the
program, most of which would go for teacher training. The Texas
Education Agency is developing a course that will be offered to
teachers, beginning this summer. Teachers who volunteer for the
program would get a $150 stipend for taking the course.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gregory Luna, D-San Antonio, however, said a flaw in the
bill is its failure to specify that only those teachers who have
completed the TEA training course could teach the intensive,
accelerated classes. The committee rejected his effort to amend the
bill to make such a requirement.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also approved other amendments that would reduce
the maximum student-teacher ratio in the intensive reading
instructions to 16-1 and mandates that the district provide
transportation to children required to attended extended-day and
summer programs.

   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ At least 280 people are feared drowned
after a passenger ship sank last weekend between the Indonesian
islands of Borneo and Sumatra, port officials said Wednesday. There
were different reports about the number of people on board, but an
official named Zainuddin said the Belize-registered Harta Rimba,
carrying more than 300 people and a cargo of timber, sank off
Tambelan island at midnight Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A passing cargo ship rescued 19 people but some 280 are missing,
Zainuddin said.
</P>
<P>
   The ship sank about 500 miles north of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Kompas reported Wednesday that the ship was bound
for Pekanbaru on Sumatra, Indonesia's largest island, and was
carrying 332 people including a seven-man crew.
</P>
<P>
   It quoted the vessel's captain, who is in a hospital in
Pontianak, Indonesia, as saying that his ship sank in rough seas
after the pumps failed. The crew distributed about 200 life jackets
and some people had to cling to oil drums or wood planks to try to
stay afloat, the captain was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors were collected in two batches _ 10 on Sunday and
nine the next day _ as rough seas and rain squalls hampered the
rescue effort, said Ari Jos Karauwan, captain of the MV Hamada, the
cargo ship that picked them up.

BARGAIN HUNTERS SLOW THE MARKET'S SLIDE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks meandered narrowly Wednesday as bargain
hunters stabilized some battered high-technology issues even as
most Internet companies continued to slide.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq market finished virtually unchanged, edging lower by
one-twentieth of 1 percent, following Tuesday's third-worst-ever
drubbing in point terms. But it was a performance that offered
little reassurance that the 8 percent retreat from its Feb. 1
record close has ended.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did analysts take much encouragement from a bounce in the
session's final half hour that lifted the Dow Jones industrials and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 to gains of about half of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little concerned that earnings expectations are a
little high and valuations are full,'' said John Ballen, chief
strategist at MFS Investment Management in Boston. In coming weeks,
he said, ``You could have a pretty choppy market.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also expressed concern about the relative paucity of
stocks moving higher of late and a persistent erosion among a large
number of lesser issues. For example the Standard &AMP; Poor's 400
index of midsize stocks and the S&AMP;P 600 index of
small-capitalization stocks each slumped Thursday and are down more
than 8 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500, by contrast, which includes IBM, Intel, Cisco and
other high-tech heavyweights, is down less than half of 1 percent
so far in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Competition from rising interest rates, according to Mary
Farrell of Paine Webber, is also troubling stock investors. ``It's
backed the market into a trading range,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Dow's blue chip industrials showed a gain of
44.28 points, at 9,177.31, with a 6 1/2-point surge in IBM, to 168
7/8, accounting for 60 percent of it. J. P. Morgan was the second
biggest contributor, rising 3 5/16 to 103 13/16. General Electric,
up 2 to 97 15/16, was third.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris, which lost a lawsuit involving a California
smoker, was the Dow's biggest drag, off 3 15/16 to 41 7/16 on
volume of 25.4 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet stocks were lower, partly on disappointment that
Lycos commanded less than expected in the search-directory's buyout
deal announced on Tuesday. Lycos tumbled another 7, to 87 1/4,
after trading as low as 77. Amazon.com fell 2 9/16 to 97 7/16,
bringing its five-day loss to 22.5 percent. Its shares are worth
less than half their Jan. 8 peak of 199 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft inched up 9/16 to 160 5/8 as its chief financial
officer, Gregory B. Maffei, told a Goldman Sachs technology
conference in New York that he finds skidding prices for Internet
stocks a boon as his company explores acquisitions and partnerships
in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Bramwell, president of Bramwell Capital Management,
said on returning from the conference that the mood was ``really
upbeat'' and said she was skeptical about a widely -shared
prediction of a lull in computer-related business following the
surge from addressing the year-2000 computer clock problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks as if it will continue to be rolling past 2000,'' she
said, with electronic commerce becoming ``an enormous business.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks, often a haven for nervous investors, were mostly
higher by large fractions Thursday, with Pfizer up 1 1/2 to 126 3/4
and Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn up 1 1/2 to 54 1/4, the latter reporting
sharply higher fourth-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, declines outnumbered advances
1,855 to 1,177, with only 19 stocks making new highs and 95 new
lows. Volume was relatively light for the third consecutive day, at
721.7 million shares.

   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ROSIE-PEREZ-FILMS (New York) _ Rosie Perez has built an
improbable acting career, which began with a chance encounter with
the director Spike Lee, on being pretty much what she is: an
intense, voluble, working-class Puerto Rican from Brooklyn who is
indelibly from her own unfashionable patch of turf. In her new
film, ``The 24-Hour Woman,'' written and directed by Nancy Savoca,
she plays a familiar character but with a twist. She is definitely
Ms. Perez, but she is also a successful television producer, rather
than a kid from the streets, trying to balance work, marriage and
motherhood. By Peter Applebome. &UR;  &LR; (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SMOKING-BARRELS-FILM (London) _ ``Could every one of you stop
getting shot?'' a particularly hapless character asks well into
``Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,'' the cheeky London gangland
film that opens on March 5. This request comes out of a desperation
at once comic and fearful, as befitting an alternately funny and
violent tale of London criminality from the lunatic to the thuggish
_ which is to say, from dope-addicted, well-spoken public school
boys (known as ``trustafarians'' for their ready access to trust
funds to finance their habit), to seasoned tough guys with
Runyonesque names like Big Chris and Hatchet Harry. By Matt Wolf.
(Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH-FILMS-SPEECH (Undated) _ Moviegoers on these shores have
long been baby-powdered by British actors who pamper every line as
if the English language were a newborn's bottom. If we weren't
savoring the plummy consonants in stuffy Merchant-Ivory
productions, we were relishing the plumped vowels in stifling
Elizabethan costume dramas. Lately, though, British movies have
become both less mannered and less manored. And the grittier the
fiction, the muddier the diction. The British cinema isn't dead,
it's just not speaking as clearly. By Franz Lidz. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   THINGS-FALL-APART-THEATER (Undated) _ ``Things Fall Apart,'' is
a drama with music now at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in
Newark. Adapted from the classic 1958 novel of the same name by the
Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe, the production chronicles the rise
and fall of a Nigerian leader who watches his beliefs and
traditions unravel with the arrival of missionaries and other white
foreigners in Africa in the early 1900s. By Rachel L. Swarns.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Reviews of ``You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown''; ``Blue Heart'' and ``Aches to Aches''. By Vincent
Canby. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   FREE-THEATER (New York) _ The crowd at the Actors Studio Free
Theater at Raw Space spills into the small lobby at 529 West 42nd
Street. A mix of young people and old, their names are checked off
a clipboard as they arrive. There is a smattering of theater
celebrity; the playwright Romulus Linney and his daughter, the
actress Laura Linney, came to a recent performance of Clifford
Odets's ``Awake and Sing!,'' as did Ellen Adler of the Stella Adler
Conservatory. During intermission in the big barnlike space, people
talk about what they have just seen in ``Power Failure.'' This is a
crowd that goes to plays and performances like connoisseurs: on the
lookout for the unusual. That is certainly true of the price: it's
free _ as it has been since Arthur Penn, 76, the president of the
Actors Studio, created the Free Theater in 1997. By Liz Welch.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   651-ARTS-DANCE (New York) _ One of the best-kept secrets in the
performing arts in New York City is 651 Arts. The Brooklyn-based
producing and presenting organization is often confused with the
Brooklyn Academy of Music, a separate corporation that helped found
651 Arts nearly 10 years ago and has maintained a symbiotic
relationship with it. Today, 651 is a major developer, producer and
presenter of contemporary performing-arts works by black artists
like Donald Byrd (``Harlem Nutcracker'' and ``Jazz Train''), Anna
Deavere Smith (``Fires in the Mirror'') and Randy Weston (a
production of his rarely performed 1961 ``Uhuru Afrika''). This
month, 651 is one of 13 organizations citywide that is
participating in a salute to the documentary ``I'll Make Me a
World.'' By Jennifer Dunning. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   KIRCHNER-MUSIC (New York) _ On Saturday evening, at Merkin
Concert Hall, a group of fine musicians will gather to pay tribute
to one of America's finest composers: Leon Kirchner. Kirchner
turned 80 last month, and the retrospective concert is a kind of
birthday present. The real beneficiaries, though, will be the
members of the audience, for Kirchner's music has always been
outgoing, strong, challenging, glorious to hear. He is a big man,
and he makes big music. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SWENSEN-VIOLINIST (Undated) _ As a young violinist, Joseph
Swensen had a rapidly blossoming international career and top
management: ICM Artists booked him for some 100 events a season. He
had an exclusive contract with a major label, BMG/RCA, which
promised at least six recordings. Having studied with the world's
most revered violin pedagogue, Dorothy DeLay, at the Juilliard
School, he had a blistering technique second to none. He also had
something infinitely more precious: a restless, probing, highly
personal musicianship. But in 1991, at 31, Swensen did something
shocking if not heretical, abandoning the violin and announcing
that he would accept engagements only as a conductor. Eight years
later, violin cognoscenti still shake their heads at mention of his
name, whether in sad or admiring disbelief. By K. Robert Schwarz.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-CLASSICAL-CDs (Undated) _ Back when the LP still
reigned, long before the classical CD glut, a new recording of
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony or Tchaikovsky's ``Pathetique'' would
inevitably draw some critic's weary sigh, ``Do we really need
another one?'' Now, as CD bins groan _ and the browser's mind reels
_ with choices beyond number, a new wave of mainstream classical
CDs from England washes on these shores. And the old refrain
echoes: do we really need this? Not to milk the suspense, the
answer in this refreshing case is yes. Well, mostly yes. At hand is
a boxful of budget-price CDs offering a potpourri (or is it a
hodgepodge?) of composers and works, all performed by the Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra of London with various conductors. By
Lawrence B. Johnson. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK-ART-SONGS (New York) _ Since Aristotle, and on through
Newton, Baudelaire and Scriabin, progressive thinkers have linked
the aural sensation of music to the visual sensation of color. But
is the color of the composer ever audibly discernible? The
distinguished American mezzo-soprano Florence Quivar explores that
question Sunday afternoon, when she and the pianist Wayne Sanders
present a recital of art songs by black composers at the 92d Street
Y. Although Ms. Quivar has long wished to mine the rich but
little-known lode of black American art songs, this is only the
third opportunity she has had to do so. By Cori Ellison. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ-LABELS-MERGER (Undated) _ Two weeks ago, two of the seven
recording imprints that comprise the major-label jazz industry _
Verve and Impulse! _ merged. They came together under the umbrella
of the Verve Music Group, a subsidiary of the new, expanded
Universal Music Group. (They will still be kept separate as
imprints, but they will be presided over by the same marketing and
sales department and general manager.) Aside from the lost jobs,
it's a sure thing that plenty of artists will be dropped from the
rosters. With fewer major-label jazz records coming out, and many
great musicians without contracts, it's now or never for for the
independent label to become an important force in jazz again. By
Ben Ratliff. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL-ART (Undated) _ The proposal sent by e-mail seemed
typical enough, full of talk about ``digital genetics, autonomous
robotics, recursive chaotic algorithms and knowbots.'' Anyone who
has ever waded past the low breakers of America Online's chat rooms
and taken a dunk in cyberspace has bumped into the same scientific
jargon, into the discussion groups and Web sites of geeks at work.
But what was startling was the proposal's subject: not an
engineering conference but ``Life 2.0,'' an international art
competition mating digital media with a high-tech project of
simulating evolution. Recursive chaotic algorithms? Digital
genetics? Welcome to an entirely new art world. Welcome to the next
century. By Steven Henry Madoff. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCIENCE-ART (New York) _ Artists are a voracious lot. They take
from everywhere, even if they misuse, abuse or only partly
understand what they borrow. In the last three decades _ ever since
Minimalism and Conceputal Art declared open season on reality _
science has played an increasingly prominent role in art. Donald
Judd used the Fibonacci series of natural numbers as a
compositional device and Robert Irwin's installations examined the
nature of visual perception. Robert Smithson embraced entropy as
the underlying principle of his art. Alan Sonfist, playing the
botanical historian, reconstructed a bit of primeval Manhattan
forest, still standing at the corner of West Broadway and Houston.
By Roberta Smith. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-MUSEUM (Karlsruhe, Germany) _ The Media Museum is one part
of the Center for Art and Media Technology (Zentrum fur Kunst und
Medientechnologie), an institution that has no exact parallel in
the world and not even a recognizable echo in America. Founded in
1989 and opened to the public in October 1997, the ZKM has more
than 48,000 square yards of usable space. It houses, in addition to
the museum, an Institute for Visual Media, an Institute of Media
and Acoustics, a media library, a media theater, a Museum for
Contemporary Art and, under different direction, the State Academy
of Design and the Municipal Gallery of the City of Karlsruhe.
Touring the Media Museum is like roaming an electronic theme park,
a futuristic playground for grown-ups where miniature theaters,
videos and oversize images morph, dance, respond to questions and
urge visitors along on fictive journeys. By Vicki Goldberg.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GARDNER-ART-EDUCATION (Cambridge, Mass.) _ Howard Gardner, a
psychologist, studies the arts, the mind and human development. He
spent two decades working with brain-damaged patients and is a
founding member and has for many years been a director of Project
Zero at Harvard, a research group started in the 1960s by Nelson
Goodman, the philosopher, to study cognition and the arts.
Increasingly. Gardner and Project Zero have become involved with
arts education and school reform. By Michael Kimmelman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VINYL-RECORDS-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ For years, a market in
vintage records has quietly flourished among a small but dedicated
group of collectors. They buy and sell through an informal network
of used-record stores, mail-order houses, magazines and, more
recently, Web sites. Some call it the vinyl underground. Of late,
however, even the auction houses have begun to take notice. With
rare albums now commanding as much as five figures, the William
Doyle Galleries in New York is betting that the time is right. On
Tuesday, Doyle will hold what it's billing as
``Rockin'/Rhythm-and-Blues: The Fine Vinyl Auction,'' the sale of a
collection of some 50,000 45s, LPs, CDs and memorabilia that span
the history of post-war popular music, from rockabilly and early
rhythm to rock, country, jazz and blues. By Fletcher Roberts.

CLINTON SAID TO DECLARE WAR ON HOUSE REPUBLICANS OVER IMPEACHMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is so furious at House
Republicans over his impeachment, his advisers say, that he has
vowed to mount an all-out offensive to knock off many of his foes
and win back the House for Democrats in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already committed to early fund-raising events in
nine cities _ the first will be in San Francisco in two weeks _ to
amass a war chest to help House Democrats. His advisers, who spoke
only on condition of anonymity, described how the president
regularly rattled off specifics about House Republicans who may be
vulnerable, from the margins they won by in 1998 to how well he
performed in their districts in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   They said Clinton now viewed winning back the House as almost as
important an affirmation of his legacy as electing Vice President
Al Gore as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   But if Clinton's partisan zeal is viewed by Republicans as a
personal vendetta, it could undermine another goal that the
president considers crucial to his legacy: his legislative
priorities, notably a drive to rescue Social Security. Clinton has
assured Democrats that they can work with Republicans to pass
legislation and still have plenty of ammunition in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was particularly angry at the House members managing the
prosecution, according to his advisers, believing they have
needlessly prolonged the impeachment trial. Most of those managers
have seats that are considered safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows the districts, he knows the candidates and he doesn't
like these people,'' said one adviser who has discussed next year's
elections with Clinton. ``He's obviously real hot on the managers.
He thinks winning back the House is part of his legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said they were aware that there is only so
much a president could do to help congressional contenders. They
said he could be most effective in raising money and in recruiting
candidates. But Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard Nixon,
despite high personal popularity, both failed in their efforts to
purge specific congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's intense interest in the congressional contests is all
the more striking because leading House Democrats have long
complained that he has not been particularly engaged in House and
Senate races, Many blame Clinton for the Democrats' loss of House
control in 1994 and for not winning it back in 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser who has spoken to the president about wresting
back the House in 2000, said, ``It will be a personal crusade.'' He
added: ``The man knows he's done wrong. But he also knows they
should not have taken it to the extreme they have. He says: `It's
the unfairness of this whole process. These right-wingers who tried
to undo the election.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his scorn at House Republicans, several advisers said
Clinton is motivated out of gratitude to Rep. Dick Gephardt, the
Democratic leader, for deciding not to challenge Vice President
Gore for the Democratic presidential nomination. He also is
described as indebted to House Democrats for sticking by him and
insuring that impeachment could not be called bipartisan.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the House managers, Clinton told Gephardt he was
determined to defeat Rep. Jay Dickey, an Arkansas Republican,
according to people familiar with the conversations. Dickey was
elected in 1992; his district includes the president's boyhood
homes of Hope and Hot Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Told of Clinton's comments, Dickey said: ``If you're sitting
there and having the most powerful office in the world, the most
powerful man in the world who says, `We're going to defeat this
person,' it's a sobering thing. But I'm not afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's going to personalize this thing, then it's going to
take us back a step in terms of cooperation,'' Dickey said, ``and
trying to get some programs through in the next two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Bryant, a Tennessee Republican who is a House manager,
said: ``If he feels he has to vindicate himself by going after
House managers, then he has to do that. All I can say is that we as
a House, the majority, felt that we certainly didn't put him in
this predicament. If anybody ought to be upset, it ought to be
American people, with the president, for doing those things.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that impeachment and the Democrats' encouraging
performance in last November's elections have unexpectedly united
the White House and House Democrats. People close to Gephardt and
Clinton said that in a meeting in the White House residence on the
day earlier this month when Gephardt announced he would not run,
the president gave his assurances that he would do whatever it
takes to make Gephardt the next speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was telling Dick which districts he can win,'' said one
person who was familiar with the conversations. He noted the oddity
of Clinton trying to educate his party's House leader _ who has
been worrying about House districts for years _ about congressional
match-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Nichols, Gephardt's spokeswoman, said of the president:
``He said he would do whatever we asked him to do. Essentially,
Gore said the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the president, his impeachment has emboldened other
Democrats who say they are eager to unseat House Republicans.
``After these years of Ken Starr, people are more energized than
I've seen them since the '60s and '70s,'' said David Geffen, the
entertainment mogul and major Clinton supporter. Referring to Rep.
James Rogan, a California Republican who is considered one of the
most vulnerable House managers in 2000, he added, ``Many of us are
looking forward to spending time and money and effort to defeating
James Rogan.''
</P>
<P>
   And People for the American Way, a liberal group, announced a $5
million television, organizational and grass-roots campaign on
Wednesday aimed at ousting Republicans in Congress. ``Impeachment
was the catalyst that shocked and angered voters,'' said the
group's president, Carol Shields.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have not been shy about saying how they
plan to use the Republicans' impeachment votes against them.
``Every one of those distinguished citizens is now on record saying
they not only want to shut the government down but they want to
kick the president out,'' said one senior Clinton strategist.
``That vote won't go away. And if they think the American people
will forget about that, they should go ask former President Gerald
Ford. They will remember that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate Democrats are planning the series of joint
fund-raisers starring the president to present what officials
described as a ``Democratic unity message.'' That is a sign that
they are hoping to take advantage of the presidential race to
nationalize the House races. Their goal is to raise $10 million in
1999 for a program they are calling ``Majority 2000.'' The money
will be split between the campaign committees of the Senate and
House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   For all of Clinton's determination to help, some White House
officials noted that many candidates did not want Clinton to
campaign in their districts last year _ and probably would not
again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they are mindful of the primaries of 1938, when
President Roosevelt tried to defeat several southern Democrats who
opposed the New Deal. The effort was a bust, and Roosevelt was
ridiculed as a dictator. And in 1970, President Nixon traveled to
23 states to assist Republican candidates but failed in his drive
to gain a Republican majority in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   One adviser to Clinton said he feared that disclosures about the
president's ire toward House Republicans could damage him, given
that the Senate has not yet voted on the articles of impeachment.
``You don't want this to fall into the gloating category, that he
already has a strategy to defeat these guys,'' the adviser said.

ALLEGED MISMANAGEMENT OF $50 BILLION RESERVE SHAKES RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ How much skulduggery does it take to shock people in a
country widely thought to be one of the most corrupt in the world?
</P>
<P>
   How about mismanaging as much as $50 billion of the country's
reserves by Russia's Central Bank?
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the accusations leveled by Russia's outgoing
general prosecutor, Yury Skuratov, just before he resigned last
week, citing health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1993 and 1998, Skuratov charged, the Central Bank
allegedly paid an obscure offshore assets-management company to
handle the money, instead of managing it itself, as central banks
usually do. Western economists here call the practice unprecedented
for the caretaker of a country's national wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov also accused Central Bank executives of illegal sales
of government property and of maintaining extravagant lifestyles at
state expense.
</P>
<P>
   In many places, such charges lodged by a top law-enforcement
official would set off a political firestorm. Outside Russia, the
allegations are bound to raise even more doubts about the wisdom of
granting Moscow's request for new loans. But inside Russia, where
benefiting from government funds has been a traditional path to
upward mobility, the reaction has been rather quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank chairman, Viktor Gerashchenko, even confirmed
the practice, if not the sums involved. Gerashchenko said Russia
needed to hide its assets to avoid seizure by creditors owed
billions of dollars of Soviet-era debt that Russia has promised to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Gerashchenko said that in 1994 the Central Bank transferred $1.4
billion to the accounts of FIMACO, a company registered on the
Island of Jersey, off England.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time Russia was involved in difficult negotiations
with the (creditors), and there was a probability that the
country's foreign property could be seized,'' Gerashchenko said in
comments reported by The Moscow Times. ``FIMACO was set up to avoid
complications.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Skuratov's letter, which was handed out to members
of the State Duma lower house of parliament, the Central Bank
allowed FIMACO to handle $37.3 billion, 9.98 billion Deutsche
marks, 379.9 billion yen, 11.98 billion French francs and 862.6
million British pounds. This amounts to almost $50 billion at
current rates of exchange, and, Skuratov said, included funds from
multibillion-dollar loan packages from the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Western economists have been scratching their heads in
amazement. Eric Kraus, head of the fixed incomes desk at Dresdner
Bank's Moscow office, called the allegations and Gerashchenko's
partial confirmation ``astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraus said he thought the $50 billion figure was ``doubtless
exaggerated'' because the Central Bank ``never had that much to
manage.'' But he was left with more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who actually managed this money, and how was it invested, what
were the results, how much was charged for this service, to whom
did the profits go, and where is the money now?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows. Nor will they ever, if some Russian politicians
have their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong to launch a criminal proceeding only on the
basis of the transfer of money to this firm,'' remarked lawmaker
Georgy Luntovsky, who chairs the Duma's committee that oversees the
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say nothing in Russian law prevents the Central Bank
from acting as it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing illegal about commercial activities by the
Central Bank that do not always coincide with the interests of the
state,'' said Georgy Bovt, political commentator of the liberal
daily Segodnya.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bovt said the government should investigate whether
anyone profited personally from the offshore investing of
government funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bovt and other analysts suggested that Skuratov's charges
stemmed from an investigation into the causes of Russia's financial
collapse last August, when the government devalued the ruble and
defaulted on $40 billion of domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
   The target of this investigation had been former Central Bank
chairman Sergei Dubinin, whom Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
replaced with Gerashchenko when Primakov was appointed in
September. But the current allegations have dragged Gerashchenko, a
former Soviet Central Banker who also held Russia's top bank post
from 1992 to 1994, into the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe this is what forced Skuratov to resign. Others say
the prosecutor's downfall was caused by another probe that came
into the open last week with a series of raids by security agents
on companies linked to the influential financier and power broker
Boris Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps both Skuratov's ouster and Berezovsky's troubles are
connected with Primakov's recent moves to consolidate the powers he
received when Yeltsin informally pass over day-to-day control of
the country to him last fall. Whatever the explanation, none of
this is improving the image of Russia's leaders abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are working out their differences in this way in public,
and no one is thinking how Western creditors are looking at this,''
Bovt said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The crowd at the Actors Studio Free Theater at Raw
Space spills into the small lobby at 529 W. 42nd St. A mix of young
people and old, their names are checked off a clipboard as they
arrive. There is a smattering of theater celebrity; the playwright
Romulus Linney and his daughter, the actress Laura Linney, came to
a recent performance of Clifford Odets' ``Awake and Sing!,'' as did
Ellen Adler of the Stella Adler Conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   During intermission in the big barnlike space, people talk about
what they have just seen. This is a crowd that goes to plays and
performances like connoisseurs: on the lookout for the unusual.
That is certainly true of the price: it's free _ as it has been
since Arthur Penn, the president of the Actors Studio, created the
Free Theater in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Penn, 76, has put on his director's hat for ``Power Failure'' by
Larry Gelbart, 75, a longtime friend of the stage and film
director. Based on the structure of ``La Ronde,'' involving 10
scenes with two people each, it opened last Friday and runs through
March 7. Two more plays follow in this season's series: Vaclav
Havel's ``Increased Difficulty of Concentration,'' directed by
Arthur Storch, in late March, and ``Passion Play'' by Peter
Nichols, to be directed by Elinor Renfield, in May.
</P>
<P>
   The series at Raw Space began when the famed Actors Studio, the
home of the naturalistic style of acting known as the Method, was
celebrating its 50th birthday. At the time, Penn was said to be
trying to widen the perception of the organization as well as
encouraging the creation of new plays with large casts.
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has presented plays by, among others, Jay Presson
Allen, Liz Swados, Jack Gelber and Migdalia Cruz. While there is no
charge, those wishing to attend must register with Ticket Central
at (212) 279-4200.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process,'' Penn said, ``has gone out of American theater
because of economics.'' It is important for actors to inhabit a
play, he said, and work through its problems, which takes time. The
``process'' applies to playwriting as well as to acting, Penn said,
and his mission is to have a ``place where a playwright can see a
play develop.'' As a result, critics are not invited.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Judith Ivey starred in ``Trudy Blue,'' a play by
Marsha Norman about a cancer victim. Ms. Ivey found the series ``a
great safety net'' and said: ``You walk the tightrope and, if you
fall, you come back the next night, get back up and find a change.
That kind of risk-taking doesn't happen in commercial venues.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Jackson, a board member of the Actors Studio, who played
the mother in ``Awake and Sing!'' said, ``It's a sacrifice for the
actors, yet it gives you freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Penn, the actors receive $100 a week for four weeks
of rehearsal and a total of 24 performances. ``That is all we are
allowed,'' by Equity, he said. ``We are doing it really on the
skinny.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has helped is the television series ``Inside the
Actors Studio.'' ``Bravo licensed it and we began to receive a
certain amount of royalties,'' Penn said, though he would not
specify the figure. ``We are a not-for-profit organization, so I
thought: `What are we going to do? Why not start a live theater to
put actors to work on a project with playwrights who feel protected
to come and work.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Equity was wonderful about it,'' he added. ``We went to Equity
and explained that this was going to be a free theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Another windfall was the dollar-a-year lease, a handshake
agreement, Penn said, between himself and David Buckley, who
manages Raw Space. The deal will remain, Buckley said, ``as long as
Penn keeps his promise: free theater.''
</P>
<P>
   As Penn remembers it: ``When I first went to Buckley, he said,
`If you bring the Actors Studio here, it will validate this space.'
Raw Space was very generous. They said, `If you want to turn this
space into a theater, we will charge you a dollar a year.' '' In
exchange, Penn agreed to build the theater, which, according to
Gary Richards, the Free Theater's executive producer, cost roughly
$300,000.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A couple of other windfalls didn't hurt. ``I called my friend
Hugh Hardy, the architect who did the New Amsterdam Theater, and we
designed it,'' Penn said. ``Robert Wankel, the secretary-treasurer
of the Actors Studio, is also on the executive board of the Shubert
Organization, so when they changed the seats in the Shubert
Theater, we got them.''
</P>
<P>
   Raw Space, part of a former Army Reserve Training Center (thus
the name of the Armory co-op in the adjoining building), is now a
35,000-square-foot theater and studio rental complex. In addition
to the 99-seat Actors Studio Free Theater, it houses a 35-seat
theater used by the Sage Theater company, and a 75-seat theater for
hire.
</P>
<P>
   There are 10 rental studios _ ``The Civil War,'' the forthcoming
Broadway musical by Frank Wildhorn, has rehearsed in one; the
touring production of Wildhorn's ``Jekyll and Hyde'' in another _ a
camera rental shop, a sound stage, and a control room for
small-scale television productions.
</P>
<P>
   Gelbart, for one, is pleased about the chance to revise ``Power
Failure'' at Raw Space. ``Arthur and his work are not about making
product,'' Gelbart said. ``They are about making theater.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked on the script at his home in Los Angeles, sending
rewrites by fax, and arrived in New York the first week of February
for rehearsals with a cast that includes Earle Hyman, Richard Kind
and Joe Ragno.
</P>
<P>
   Gelbart and Penn met in the 1950s when Gelbart was writing jokes
for Bob Hope and Penn was a floor manager for the Colgate Comedy
Hour. Years later, Penn asked his friend to create a modern version
of Ben Jonson's ``Volpone.'' Gelbart's answer was ``Sly Fox,''
starring George C. Scott, directed by Penn on Broadway in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Gelbart, who has hit the trifecta in television (``M-A-S-H''),
film (``Tootsie''), and theater (``A Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the Forum''), wrote ``Power Failure'' for the 1990-91 season
of the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass. After mixed
Boston notices, he put the script in a drawer _ until Penn called.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been ambivalent about the work,'' Gelbart
acknowledged. ``The problem is when you pick up a program that
reads `M-A-S-H,' `Tootsie' and `Forum,' that suggests you are in
for another laugh riot. This is not that. I think the most mature
thing about `Power Failure' is that I was willing to take off the
red nose and not be a clown.''
</P>
<P>
   While the structure of ``Power Failure'' is based on
Schnitzler's play ``Reigen'' (popularly known as ``La Ronde''), it
is much less about a sexual rondelay than the current ``Blue Room''
by David Hare on Broadway, also based on the Schnitzler play.
</P>
<P>
   The chain of encounters begins with a female journalist
interviewing a man on Death Row accused of murdering his wife and
children. The man recounts a dream in which someone is eating his
wife's hand, ``like ladyfingers.'' He says later, ``Who should be
me. In the movie. ... I know it's a wild shot. Tom Hanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Gelbart said: ``It is interesting to see when the first laugh
comes. Like, is it O.K. to laugh? The laugh stays uncertain because
it veers between pitch black and bright orange.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting the play through the ``process,'' Penn said, helped work
through the kinks. ``The brilliant bits,'' he said, ``come out of
mistakes.''

FEDERAL JUDGE ORDER AMERICAN AIRLINES' PILOTS TO RETURN TO WORK

<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge issued an order on Wednesday for pilots at
American Airlines to return to work, apparently ending five days of
labor unrest that has grounded more than 2,500 flights and
inconvenienced tens of thousands of passengers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The order came none too soon for American, the country's
second-largest carrier, which canceled 906 flights on Wednesday, 40
percent of its 2,250 flights daily. It was the worst day since
hundreds of pilots began calling in sick on Saturday in a dispute
over American's recent purchase of Reno Air, a small airline in the
West. Without the court's intervention, the dispute threatened to
disrupt travel during the Presidents Day weekend, when flights at
most airlines are expected to be full.
</P>
<P>
   American said it expected most of the pilots to return to work.
Nonetheless, it said it would still have to cancel several hundred
flights on Thursday because many of its planes were out of position
because of the disruption. The airline said it expected service to
be back to normal by the weekend. It also announced that passengers
affected by this week's cancellations would be allowed to
reschedule their flights without penalty or to receive full
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing in Dallas on Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge
Joe Kendall castigated both the company, which had sought the court
order, and the Allied Pilots Association, the union that represents
American's 9,200 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's silly for us to even be here,'' he said. ``It's like
killing a gnat with a sledgehammer.''
</P>
<P>
   After listening to both sides, he agreed that the sickout was
illegal and ordered the pilots to return to the cockpit, warning
them that he would hold them in contempt if they did not.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders vowed to abide by the order, which barred the
pilots' association from making any concerted efforts to encourage
pilots to call in sick or otherwise withhold their services. But
the union has contended all along that the sickout was a
grass-roots protest that it did not control.
</P>
<P>
   There were 2,077 pilots out sick on Wednesday, American said.
Normally about 400 are on the sick list at any one time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to scrupulously comply with the order,'' said
Brian Mayhew, a captain and vice president of the union. ``That
will not remove the elements of frustration and anger that is in
the pilot group as a result of the fact that the company is not
addressing our core concerns in the negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between American and the pilots centers on how
American integrates Reno Air, the carrier in Nevada that American
bought in December for $124 million. American said it would take a
year to 18 months to integrate Reno's 25 airplanes and 300 pilots
into its operations. But the union says American is violating its
contract with the union, which requires all flying at the airline
to be done by its members. It is demanding that American integrate
Reno faster and pay pilots at both carriers as if the merger has
been completed.
</P>
<P>
   American's terminals at airports nationwide were largely quiet
on Wednesday, though passengers continued to complain of long
delays and poor service from American personnel. The airline
estimated that about 90,000 passengers were inconvenienced by the
day's cancellations and said it was doing its best to accommodate
passengers from canceled flights on later departures or on rival
airlines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE - OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the flights canceled at John F. Kennedy International
Airport in New York yesterday were five to San Francisco, two to
Los Angeles and two to Heathrow Airport in London.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Koumers said he had waited on the telephone for two hours
Tuesday night to try to find out the status of his trip to the
British Virgin Islands before finally giving up. He and his wife,
Jackie, arrived at Kennedy Airport from their home on Long Island
on Wednesday morning with their two daughters, ages 1 and 3, only
to find that their 11:30 a.m. flight to Puerto Rico had been
canceled. American then booked them on a Tower Air flight departing
nearly 12 hours later, at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent 60 bucks to get here in the limo with all the luggage
and the girls,'' he said. ``Now they're going nuts. It's definitely
a hassle, but we're going to go anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Karla Speed, a caterer from Dallas, and her husband got as far
as Miami International Airport on their way to Costa Rica to
celebrate their first wedding anniversary. After spending the night
in an airport hotel on Tuesday, they were hoping to get on a 6 p.m.
flight on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had planned a very expensive trip in a resort, and we got a
honeymoon suite booked after lots of trouble,'' she said. ``Now
it's all ruined. This has just been terrible. I'm breaking out in
hives.'' &QL;

 The Snag in Lycos' MP3 Jukebox  &HT;

   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  What's with the new MP3 search engine on Lycos? When I
click on a song to download it, I get the same message every time:
``Internet Explorer could not open the site because the server
returned extended information.`' Please help. The MP3 revolution is
passing me by!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Most likely, the server that hosts the songs you are
trying to get is crowded and not letting anyone on. ``Most MP3
servers reach their maximum number of users during peak hours of
the day,'' says my 17-year-old son, who's quickly turning into an
expert on the subject. ``You just have to keep hammering at them.''
A spokesman for Lycos acknowledged that in its first full day, the
new MP3 search engine generated more than 1 million hits.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible cause for the message you're getting is that
some sites use ``ratios,'' letting you download stuff only if you
first upload something. It's an easy way for a site to increase its
content. You can avoid this particular problem by using an audio
search engine such as MediaFind (formerly Chaos MP3), which lets
you block ratio sites from search responses. You'll find it at &LR; 
search.mp3.de &LR;   &LR; /index.html. &LR;

<P>
   Q: My Compaq Presario home PC will not stay asleep. It wakes up
by itself during the night. This happens without any programs left
open, and it makes no difference how we put it into ``sleep'' mode.
What's going on?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Most Presarios are programmed to wake up at midnight, or
whenever the phone rings, if the PC also is being used as a fax
machine. But you can change the default and eliminate the problem.
Here's how: Restart your PC, and when the Compaq logo appears,
immediately press the F10 key. That will take you into the Setup
program. Now go the Power section, where you can change the wake-up
settings.

   Q: Recently, a gray box has been appearing in the middle of my

``Waol,'' and the text in the box says, ``This program has
performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. If the
problem persists, contact the program vendor.'' Any suggestions on
how I can get rid of this pesky problem?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: My guess is that the America Online program on your PC
has become corrupted _ ``Waol'' stands for Windows America Online.
So what you should do is delete AOL from the computer and install a
fresh copy. Of course, you should download the new copy from AOL
(keyword: Upgrade) before deleting the old one because once you
delete it, you won't be able to get online. And it would make you
feel like a fool.
</P>
<P>
   When Your Click Sticks
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I click on Microsoft Internet Explorer, I get a message
that it cannot connect to the server. Yet when I click on AOL,
which uses Internet Explorer, everything works fine. What is wrong?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of COMPUTIN () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; A: AOL is an online service that connects you to the Internet.
Once you log on, you can use AOL's built-in Internet Explorer
browser (as well as another version of IE or Netscape Navigator) to
browse the Web. When you open the browser, it goes out and connects
with the server for the browser's home page. After that, every time
you go to a new site on the Web, the browser will seek out the
server for each site's address.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not actually online, however, the browser is basically
worthless. It only works if it can connect to a server. And the
message you're getting indicates that you haven't yet gone online.
So log onto AOL first, and then open the browser.
</P>
<P>
   Folder Foul Up
</P>
<P>
   Q: I use Windows 95 for my business. I prefer to view the
contents of my folders in list form rather than icons. Every time
Windows crashes, all my folders revert to showing files as large
icons. I've been using My Computer to change them back to list form
one folder at a time, using each folder's View menu. Is there a way
to set a global preference for viewing the content of all folders
and sub-folders as lists?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: I don't know of any global options for My Computer, but
you can make life easier on yourself by managing your files instead
with Windows Explorer. When you choose List from its View menu, all
the folders are displayed that way. FYI, the easiest way to start
Windows Explorer is by right-clicking the Windows Start button and
choosing Explore.

 CD recorders have become cheap enough to use at home  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
You no longer need to be a major recording studio or a multimedia
software developer to produce your own compact discs and CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   All you need is a machine that sells for as low as $199, and
blank CDs that go for about $1 each.
</P>
<P>
   The incredible dropping prices of &UR;  &LR; CD recorders have sparked a
surge of home use. People are using them for multimedia projects,
backing up their data and making their own party-mix music CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the devices are built into stereo systems and personal
computers, while others are separate machines that can be moved
between PCs and stereos. Sales of machines to burn your own CD have
more than doubled in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Kristina Woolsey of Kentfield bought a CD recorder last year
when her daughter Erika was graduating from the Ross School eighth
grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's more interested in art than technology, and she had the
idea to take all the kids' faces (in her graduating class) and
morph one into the next,'' Woolsey said. When Erika completed the
project, she used the new machine to burn 50 CDs, one for each of
her classmates.
</P>
<P>
   The machines rely on a laser to literally burn the digital code
into the blank plastic disc. There is no smell or physical
manifestation of the burn, and people describe the process as
fairly easy to master.
</P>
<P>
   A song can be recorded onto a CD in less than two minutes; a
full CD can take up to half an hour to record.
</P>
<P>
   Music CDs _ even those with tunes &LR;   &LR; downloaded from the Internet
_ can be played anywhere. Software CDs can be designed to work on
both Macintosh or Windows-based computers.
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquity of CDs has contributed to the recorders'
popularity. People have CD players not only in their stereo
systems, but also in their cars and portable CD devices that they
carry around with them. Almost every computer sold nowadays comes
with a CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   The familiarity with music CDs has led to a surging popularity
of CD recorders, said analyst Kevin Hause at IDC, a high-tech
research firm. Philips makes a dual deck CD player-recorder so
people can create custom mixes on CDs. ``They're doing very, very
well with that. They're having trouble keeping up with demand,'' he
said, noting sales of more than 500,000 units in the past six
months. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of CDROM11 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The recorders come in two flavors: those that can burn a disc
only once, and ``rewritable`' machines that can record over and
over.
</P>
<P>
   The Woolseys of Kentfield use their CD recorder for a wide
variety of projects. Erika's brother Matt, 16, a sophomore at Marin
Academy high school, records his own piano and saxophone playing
onto CDs, records songs off of other CDs, makes CDs for class
projects and also uses them to store discs from a summer job with a
multimedia studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go down to an electronics store, buy a (blank) CD for
a buck, and put whatever you want on it,'' Matt Woolsey said.
``What's really good about the CD is, if a file's really big, I can
just save it onto a CD.''
</P>
<P>
   He completed one school assignment on the Roman Empire by
scanning pictures from books, downloading images from the Web,
copying video clips from Grolier's multimedia encyclopedia and
writing original text. He stored the whole work on two CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's helping an English teacher at his school with a project
on ``Race, Redress and Recovery.'' A class of 14 students has
assembled writing, photos and video of what Woolsey called ``brutal
moments from history.'' A company told the teacher it would put it
all on CDs, one for each student, for $200; Woolsey is doing it for
her for free.
</P>
<P>
   As more sound and images move into the digital language of
computers, people need a place to store them. The 1.4 megabytes of
information that a floppy disk holds, and even the 100 megabytes of
a typical Zip disk, are proving inadequate for some of the
increasingly massive files.
</P>
<P>
   A CD, by comparison, holds a whopping 650 megabytes of data. But
some users are already straining the CD's capacity. Those people
are eagerly awaiting the next revolution: DVDs, or digital video
disks, which are two-sided and could hold up to 8 gigabytes of data
_ a more than tenfold increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think I could never use all this space. Now you can
never get enough,'' said Stephen Wallace, a test engineer at
Sandisk, a Sunnyvale computer chip company. He backs up his hard
drive onto a CD, and also duplicates computer games so that he can
play his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the market for CD recorders is growing phenomenally.
Mary Bourdon, a principal analyst at the San Jose market research
firm Dataquest, said 2.5 million CD recordable and rewritable
devices were sold in 1997. While the final sales figures aren't in
yet for 1998, she said manufacturers shipped as many as 6 million
units to stores, and most of those probably sold _ so sales more
than doubled from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of CDROM11 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Demand for the products was truly grassroots, said Bruce Youmans,
director of marketing communications for TDK Electronics Corp.,
which makes blank CDs. ``It's one of those situations in which,
with very little heavy advertising or promotional marketing
support, but by the simple means of word of mouth, interest has
taken flight,'' Youmans said.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the advent of CDs, both in computers and in music,
people have wanted to record on them. But CD recorders started out
at $125,000, which only a major studio could afford, Youmans said.
Within several years, though, that price dropped into consumers'
buying ranges of $500 and less.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Kruse, 36, recalls how ``I spent hours in my life creating
those party tapes. I'd pull out one album, record that song, then
another ... then my friends would want a copy, but I couldn't do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Kruse, the director of consumer products at Pinnacle
Systems, a Mountain View company, makes party CDs and can burn
multiple copies for whoever wants one.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Iampietro, 39, also works at Pinnacle, which makes hardware
and software for editing video on PCs. He uses the CD burner to
store the videos he's created.
</P>
<P>
   Iampietro has been editing video for years, he said, but putting
it on CDs is easier and more durable. ``You can always make a copy
of the CD as good as the original CD,'' he said. ``Videotape gets
worse and worse and worse, and by the time you notice, it's too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   More and more people are downloading music off the Internet and
putting it onto CDs, which they can immediately play in their
stereos without any special technology.
</P>
<P>
   But many people still connect to the Net via telephone lines,
which can't handle many large files containing music and video.
Therefore, they prefer CDs to store those types of files.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Mann, who runs a San Francisco multimedia firm with his
brother, uses his CD burner to back up his data. With his frequent
backups, he can bring the CDs on trips and have access to his
entire hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``My laptop has become my existence,'' Mann said. ``When I go on
a trip and I bring my computer with me, just having a CD-ROM with
all of my important stuff is so light in my bag, it relaxes me.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the annals of American politics, few lawmakers
have unwittingly done more to help members of Congress raise money
than Carter Glass and Henry Steagall, the authors of a
Depression-era law that sharply limited the cross-ownership of
commercial banks, securities firms and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 20 years or so, legislative proposals to break
down those barriers have been an annual rite of Congress, played
out invariably in turf wars between wealthy industries, competing
committee chairmen and powerful regulators who have fought to
congressional gridlock. The beneficiaries of the exercise are the
political parties and the members of three congressional
committees, who use the issue as a stalking-horse to raise millions
of dollars from those business interests who have a stake in the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1997-1998 election cycle, for instance, a legislative
session in which the House of Representatives for the first time in
history passed legislation to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act, the
industries that lobbied the issue gave more than $15 million to the
members of the three committees _ House Banking, House Commerce and
Senate Banking _ and more than $42 million to political parties and
all candidates for federal offices, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that researches money and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The annual ritual began anew Wednesday, when top executives from
Wall Street and Main Street trooped to the House Banking Committee
to urge passage of financial services legislation that would make
it easier and less expensive for conglomerates to offer banking,
insurance and securities underwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Overflowing from a committee hearing room, lobbyists lined
Capitol Hill hallways to glean the details of competing legislation
and to listen to the beginning of three days of testimony that will
feature Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman; Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, and a host of banking and securities
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is February, and like the swallows returning to
Capistrano, we return to financial modernization,'' said Rep. Bruce
Vento, D-Minn., the ranking Democrat on a House subcommittee on
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Setting the table for a veritable feast of political
fund-raising events in the next few months, the lawmakers outlined
different proposals that, in one form or another, have been under
consideration for years. In those same years, financial
conglomerates have tried to get around the restrictions imposed by
the Glass-Steagall and Bank Holding Company acts through
complicated and expensive legal maneuvering that sets up corporate
structures to permit institutions to sell insurance, underwrite
securities and offer insured bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Competing measures were introduced by Rep. James Leach, R-Iowa,
chairman of the House Banking Committee, and Rep. John LaFalce,
D-N.Y., the committee's ranking Democrat. LaFalce's measure was
largely endorsed by the Clinton administration. But the LaFalce
measure contains as one of its main features a provision that may
doom it in the Senate: an endorsement of an older low- and
moderate-income community lending law that last year ran into
insurmountable opposition from Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, chairman
of the Senate Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, who blocked a measure that had been worked out by former
Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York when he was chairman of
the banking committee, has said he intended to introduce his own
bill this month. Gramm has said Congress should not repeal the
Glass-Steagall Act without also rolling back the requirement that
regulators, when considering proposed mergers and new branches,
take into account the bank's lending record to lower- and
moderate-income customers.
</P>
<P>
   He has compared that law, the Community Reinvestment Act, to a
form of legalized extortion. Democrats have considered it a central
tenet of social fairness for a core constituency, and some aides
predicted Wednesday that although insisting on it may ultimately
mean that there will be no new banking legislation, it is far more
important politically to isolate Gramm on that issue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another, longer-standing aspect of the legislative fight
concerns which regulatory agency should take the lead under any new
law. Greenspan has endorsed proposals that would require
diversified financial companies to be structured as separate
entities under one holding company. The Federal Reserve now
regulates bank holding companies and would continue to do so under
these proposals, which are part of Leach's bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration opposes that approach because it would
rob the Treasury, which oversees nationally chartered banks, from
playing a prominent role in banking issues. Rubin, in supporting
LaFalce's measure Wednesday, reiterated his long-held position that
financial conglomerates should be allowed to provide services like
securities underwriting or merchant banking through subsidiaries of
parent commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
   While on one level the disagreement between Greenspan and Rubin
reflects an arcane issue of corporate governance and its
regulation, the debate has broader financial and policy
ramifications. The outcome will determine whether the Federal
Reserve, an independent agency, will regulate financial
conglomerates or whether they will fall under the supervision of
the Treasury, which is controlled by political appointments made by
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as a matter of corporate bookkeeping, the structuring
of securities or insurance departments as subsidiaries of banking
operations would mean that their activities would contribute to the
bank's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Another contentious issue is whether any new law should permit
the emerging financial behemoths to be affiliated with industrial
companies, as they are in some Asian and European countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Leach proposal would permit existing financial companies
that have limited revenue from nonfinancial enterprises to continue
to exist for at least the next decade but would restrict new
affiliations between banks and commercial companies. The LaFalce
measure would permit a bank holding company to own a commercial
company, provided that the commercial company did not account for
more than 15 percent of the holding company's overall assets.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has long opposed close affiliations between
banks and industrial companies, particularly because customer bank
deposits are insured by a federally backed fund, and Rubin
expressed strong reservations Wednesday about the acceptance of
such combinations in the LaFalce bill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whatever the outcome of the legislative fight, the clear
certainty is that it will fill many congressional coffers.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997-98 election cycle, the single biggest fund-raiser
from these industries, not surprisingly, was D'Amato, who was at
the center of a legislative compromise that failed. He raised more
than $1.7 million from the industries lobbying about the issue.
That figure represents the largest single block of money raised by
D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign that money is not always decisive in elections, he
lost. The victor, Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., received $1.4 million
from insurance, securities firms and banking interests, more money
than any other member of the House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer is now a member of the Senate Banking Committee.

BOGLE QUITS NUMBERIC INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ John C. Bogle Jr. abruptly resigned Wednesday from
Numeric Investors LP, a surprise move that cast a cloud over the
future of the Cambridge investment shop known for its
computer-driven style of ``quantitative'' money management.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle's sudden departure as a partner and managing director came
amid reports that he had clashed with Langdon B. Wheeler, the
firm's founder and head and a longtime friend of Bogle.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``two strong personalities'' as the reason for the
shakeup, Numeric spokesman Lynn Wickwire said Bogle, the son of
legendary Vanguard Group founder and chairman John C. ``Jack''
Bogle, had decided to pursue other opportunities. Wheeler and Bogle
Jr. both declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources said Bogle, 39, and Wheeler, 51, had
disagreements over the pace at which Numeric bought and sold stocks
and that Wheeler had asked Bogle to leave last weekend. Wheeler,
who founded Numeric in 1989 and brought in his friend Bogle in 1990
as a partner, grew irritated at his sidekick's marquee status and
starring role at the firm, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Quantitative investing uses computers with sophisticated
mathematical models to crunch reams of numbers on stock prices and
earnings estimates. At Numeric -- which manages $5.5 billion,
mostly for institutions, and has 5 mutual funds -- Bogle was in
charge of the all-important research team that created and
implemented the firms two core models. He also launched and oversaw
the firm's N/I fund family, using the low-cost strategies for which
his father's firm is famed.
</P>
<P>
   Bogle and Wheeler were The Odd Couple of the investing world.
They met at the asset management division of Bos ton's State Street
Bank &AMP; Trust Co. in 1985 and forged a friendship based on a love
and talent for numbers and risk. Bogle, described by colleagues as
``extroverted, energetic, and head strong,'' is a brash Harvard MBA
``who always wanted his way,'' a former associ ate said. By
contrast, Wheeler, a Yale- educated Vietnam veteran, was ``more
introspective, quieter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their split is due to two struggling egos,'' one industry
source said. Ironical ly, it was personality clashes that led
Wellington Management Co. to fire Bogle Sr. as chief executive 25
years ago. Vanguard is now the nation's second biggest mutual fund
firm, after Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Numeric, an aggressive company that has had mixed success with
its quantitative models, is a ``momentum'' investor that chases
popular stocks. Div ing in and out of the market means Nu meric
portfolios can change their entire holdings up to three times a
year, giving them a high ``turnover'' rate. Higher turnover means
higher fees for the firm but greater costs to customers, which in
clude the Massachusetts Teachers Re tirement System. It was concern
about high turnover that led The Quantitative Group of Lincoln,
another investment shop, to ask Bogle and Wheeler to stop managing
their funds in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Numeric said a team of staffers would now manage its funds and
that Mark Engerman, a partner, would as sume Bogle's duties.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Bogle's departure was a blow to small Numeric,
which depends on human inventiveness as much as cold mathematical
logic. ``It's definitely a time of caution for the shareholders
there,'' said Jeffrey McConnell, who follows Nu meric funds for
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago fund tracker. ``John was the big
force in the development of their models, so we'll have to keep a
close eye on their funds.''

EDITORIAL: THE WIDENING OLYMPIC SCANDAL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Feb. 11:
</P>
<P>
   The ethics panel drafted to investigate the role of vote-buying
in Salt Lake City's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Olympic
Games has expanded the scandal's known topography. Although the
panel had neither subpoena power nor its own auditors, it still
managed to implicate a wider array of Olympic officials in the
bribery transactions and to penetrate some of the ruses used to
hide the payments. Its efforts need to be followed up by a more
forceful investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The panel identified 10 more International Olympic Committee
members suspected of trading their votes for money and other
lucrative benefits provided by Salt Lake City boosters. That raises
the total to 24, or about one-fifth, of the members who have now
been linked to the scandal. The panel also found evidence that the
U.S. Olympic Committee helped Salt Lake City organizers deliver on
a promise to train Sudanese athletes in return for the Sudan's
vote, thus implicating Olympic officials at the national level.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel, appointed by the trustees of the Salt Lake City
organizing committee, was circumspect in pointing fingers in Utah.
Its report suggests that the unethical conduct was the handiwork
primarily of two or three bad apples on the Salt Lake City
committees and concludes that the higher-ups, the trustees, were
out of the loop about direct payments. It also characterized the
misdeeds as unethical but not criminal. Only inquiries by the U.S.
Justice Department and other authorities with subpoena power will
be credible enough to render such judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless the investigative leads contained in the panel's
report should strengthen the hand of reformers within the IOC and
major corporations that spend hundreds of millions on sponsorships
and ads and thus underwrite much of the $1.45 billion cost of
staging the Winter Games. Both sets of stakeholders should demand
that the IOC hire an independent, internationally respected law
firm and auditors to take over the investigation of Salt Lake City
and all other abuses in the bidding process in recent years. These
outsiders should also propose structural changes to transform the
IOC from a secretive club accountable to no one into a body that is
representative of the world's nations, democratic in its selection
of venues and transparent in its business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Like publicly traded corporations, the IOC, with its
ever-growing economic power, needs annual audits by outside
examiners and strict conflict-of-interest rules. It also needs to
clean out the management team that tolerated the bribe-taking
culture. Only then can the IOC hope to rebuild its credibility. A
ritual vote of confidence in Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC's
president, by his minions in March will only further damage the
Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
   The John Hancock insurance company has concluded that the
scandal has devalued the Olympic rings and the value of the Games
for advertisers. While it remains an Olympic sponsor, it is
removing the rings from its next annual report, stationery and
other material where feasible. Its cancellation of negotiations to
place about $20 million in commercials on NBC during the Winter
Games contains a not-so-subtle message: Corporate America can, and
should, bring its collective clout to bear in reforming the IOC
now.

HOME SALES AT UNSEASONABLE PACE IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   BOSTON _ When Matt and Tracy Teare of Arlington put their
two-family home on the market two Saturdays ago, they figured they
were getting a head start on the spring real estate season.
</P>
<P>
   To their surprise, by the end of the weekend the Teares had 19
offers, including at least one that was $10,000 above their
$249,000 asking price. ``It's shocking,'' says Matt Teare. ``At the
same time you are excited that you're selling your house and making
some money, but there's something disquieting about the whole
thing,... the amount of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's Spring residential home sales market is expected to
top records set last year. Fueled by low mortgage interest rates
and a healthy economy, the demand for homes in Massachusetts and
the prices they fetch show no signs of braking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The indications are that it's going to continue as the most
explosive market yet to date, more explosive than the 1980s,'' Jean
LeVaux, owner of DeWolfe New England/LeVaux in Cambridge, boldly
predicts. ``Spring started in late December.''
</P>
<P>
   While most real estate agents brace for a Spring that begins in
late February or early March and runs through late May, this year
many say consumers started shopping early, piqued perhaps by a
relatively warm winter.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was a topper in Massachusetts: more than 49,456
single-family homes were sold last year, a 7.2 percent increase
over 1997, according to the Massachusetts Association of Realtors.
With increased demand came higher prices and in some locations,
inventory shortages. The average single-family home in
Massachusetts sold for $218,146, a 9.1 percent jump over the 1997
average, with Boston area homes fetching an average of $286,168, an
increase of 13.6 percent. Sales of condominiums, a favorite of
first-time buyers, climbed 17.6 percent last year, pushing the
average price of a condo to $134,161 in the state, and $164,145 in
Greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer confidence is really what is driving the market, it's
that people believe tomorrow is going to be as good as today,''
said James C. Dougherty, president of the Massachusetts Association
of Realtors. Significantly, gains are being seen across the state,
from Cape Cod, where prices rose 12.2 percent last year, to the
Worcester area, where a single family home sold for an average of
$172,840 by the end of last year, a 14.8 percent gain over the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   The national median existing-home price was $131,000 during the
fourth quarter, according to statistics released Wednesday by the
National Association of Realtors, up 4.9 percent from the fourth
quarter of 1997 when the median price was $124,800. Single family
home sales in Massachusetts rose only .6 percent during that
period, while the average price of a single-family home increased
5.6 percent to $214,775, according to MAR.
</P>
<P>
   Intense demand in haute neighborhoods within Boston and
Cambridge has unleashed a kind of domino effect, pushing up prices
in neighorhoods once considered cheaper alternatives, like
Arlington, Somerville, Jamaica Plain, and parts of Dorchester. Most
segments of the market seem active -- from first-time home buyers
looking for condos to executives trading up for trophy houses in
the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon has some analysts worried the market may be
poised for a repeat of 1985 -- when home prices shot up 40 percent
in one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time this cycle I am beginning to get a little
concerned about the warmth of the market,'' economist Karl `Chip'
Case said. ``I'm a little nervous that the conversation is turning
more and more to housing appreciation, because then every home
buyer becomes an unwitting speculator.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who worry about the plight of the state's dwindling
affordable housing stock say an especially active Spring season
will only intensify the scramble for more inexpensive homes and
managable rents. They point to recent studies that have shown a
marked decline in the number of minorities buying homes in Boston,
a reduction attributed to the city's escalating home prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an incredible housing crisis of affordability for most
renters, both those trying to be home buyers and those who cannot
afford their rent,'' said Lew Finfer, a longtime Boston housing
activist and organizer.
</P>
<P>
   But those with the means, it seems, are primed to buy.
</P>
<P>
   On the Cape, it is consumers shopping for seaside second homes
who are fueling a buying spate. ``Basically there's only about four
waterfront properties left on the market in this area,'' said Olive
Jamieson, a broker with Meadow Marsh Real Estate in Eastham.
``Everything is selling so fast. I was trying to compile a list for
a customer coming down tomorrow, and the ones (properties) that I
set aside are now all under agreement.''

METROPOLITAN LIFE EXECUTIVE SHAKEUP ANNOUNCED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. plans a major executive shake-up
in a move to cut costs and meet higher profit goals as the
insurance giant goes public, the company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the shake-up, Jim Benson, chairman and chief executive of
subsidiary New England Financial, will be put in charge of
MetLife's sprawling retail sales network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are streamlining operations across our entire enterprise,''
said Kevin Foley, a MetLife spokesman in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, which take effect March 1, include dissolving the
insurer's Corporate Management Office, which made all major
decisions and created the ``perception MetLife was run by a
committee,'' according to an internal memo Wednesday by chairman
Bob Benmosche.
</P>
<P>
   The office will be replaced by nine executives, including New
England Financial's Benson, the company said. Benson, who oversaw
record 26 percent increases in premium sales at New England
Financial, is seen as a lynchpin in MetLife's strategy to rapidly
grow sales, the company said. He will take charge of MetLife's
nationwide sales force of 11,000.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the new executive group include vice chairmen Jerry
Clark and Stu Nagler, head of institutional sales Rob Henrickson,
general counsel Gary Beller, head of MetLife Auto &AMP; Home Cathy Rein
and Bill Toppeta, who will head a new client services department.
</P>
<P>
   MetLife also said it plans to cut costs by combining
administrative and marketing functions at subsidiaries, including
New England Financial, Nathan &AMP; Lewis, Texas Life and Security
First.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent moves come in the wake companywide layoffs over
the past year meant to cut non-sales costs by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   MetLife is planning to take the company public by offering
shares in an intitial public offering before the end of the year.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Feb. 11:
</P>
<P>
   A hallmark of our time is the way every artifact or event, no
matter how trivial, turns into an assessment of where and who we
are. A week after the groundhog visits his shadow, the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences releases its Oscar nominations,
which lie before us now like so many tea leaves. The question is
not whether Tom Hanks can win the best actor award one more time,
but what it would say about us if he did.
</P>
<P>
   Does the pattern of nominations _ ``Shakespeare in Love''
trumping ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Jim Carrey going wholly
unmentioned _ reflect the sour, shameful mood of a nation burdened
by an impeachment trial? Or does it capture the powerful surge of
our economy, the flood tide of job creation, and optimism over a
long-lasting boom?
</P>
<P>
   There is a tendency to read these nominations as if they were
the results of a nationwide poll, a more impartial verdict on the
state of the union than the president was able to deliver when he
appeared before Congress last month. But how can that verdict be
accurate when ``There's Something About Mary'' _ one of the year's
most popular if moronic films _ is up for nothing?
</P>
<P>
   Culture means, in part, the effort to decide what culture means.
But the meaning of the list of Academy Award nominees released
Monday afternoon is perfectly ambiguous, just as it has been every
year since 1929. It means whatever you want it to mean, however you
choose to slice it.
</P>
<P>
   The movies nominated reflect the times, of course, but only so
far. Cate Blanchett's and Judi Dench's separate versions of Queen
Elizabeth resemble each other little more than they do Bette Davis'
version. If nothing else, we are asked to believe that the list of
nominees reflects the Academy's verdict on the state of the film
industry.
</P>
<P>
   It reflects more accurately the state of lobbying within the
film industry, as well as the industry's desire to project a
respectable image before a worldwide audience.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At four or five points in the Senate impeachment
trial of President Clinton, Sen. Joseph Lieberman said, he came
very close to deciding that he would have to vote to convict and
remove his old friend, a man he had known and cared about for 29
years.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, though, Lieberman, D-Conn., ``pulled back from the
brink'' for a number of reasons, including the president's popular
support, he said. ``We're standing in place of the people, the
voters, and we'd be irresponsible not to take them into account.
They continue to trust him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lieberman said, ``the decision was harder than I would
have guessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about how he finally made that decision, and his
all-over-the-map feelings toward the president as he did so,
Lieberman began an hourlong interview in his office on Wednesday by
joking: ``I consider this therapy. Do you want me to lie down?''
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, the experience of the last year has been hard on
Lieberman, who is considered a bit of a moralizer and was the first
in his party to sternly reprimand the president after he admitted
his affair. On Wednesday, Lieberman called himself ``perhaps
naive'' to have felt betrayed by the president's behavior. And he
insists that the scandal has also been far more traumatic for
Clinton than most people think.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to maintain his dignity and his pride,'' Lieberman
said. ``He's told me that as president, he can't walk around
wounded and depressed.'' But Lieberman said he had seen Clinton's
remorse and believes that recent months have been awful for him and
his family. ``I've been with him,'' he said, ``and without getting
into those conversations, you just have to believe that it's been
what one would expect _ a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Lieberman sees it that way. Though he generally
shares Clinton's politics, he has occasionally been critical, most
dramatically as the Democrat toughest on his fellow party members
during 1997 hearings of the Senate committee investigating possible
campaign finance abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, who is 56, got to know Clinton in 1970, when the
young Yale law student volunteered in Lieberman's first political
campaign, a race for a Connecticut state Senate seat. And Lieberman
was among the first to endorse his former aide as a presidential
candidate in 1992, ``with timing that was not what one would call
exquisite,'' he said on Wednesday. ``I endorsed him two days before
Gennifer Flowers'' made a sex scandal one of the first things that
many Americans ever heard about Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``So these stories had hung over his head for some time,'' the
senator said, crossing his arms over his chest. But a year ago,
when Lieberman first heard the allegations of an affair between
Clinton and a former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, he said
he immediately felt that ``this was different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a feeling the ground was shaking; it was like a
political earthquake,'' a time filled with great anxiety and
uncertainty, he said. ``Then we went through the finger-wagging,''
when Clinton insisted he had not had sexual relations with ``that
woman, Miss Lewinsky.'' Had the senator believed his friend then?
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman sighed, clasped his hands, looked at the ceiling. ``I
was suspicious. Skeptical. But he deserved for me to say he
deserved the presumption of innocence. So in fairness, I put it
aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came Aug. 17 and the president's admission that there had
been an affair after all. ``That made me angry,'' Lieberman said,
suddenly jiggling his foot for all he was worth. ``I felt betrayed,
and felt that his admissions were not adequate to the facts, not
about just the relationship but lying to the country. It brewed in
me, stirred in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Several generations of relatives, on vacation with Lieberman at
the Connecticut shore, gave voice to his internal debate, the
senator said. His 84-year-old mother pleaded: ``Joseph, give him
another chance. Everyone makes mistakes.'' His three children in
their 20s, on the other hand, were outraged and hurt, he said. And
his 10-year-old daughter said she would be embarrassed to go back
to school and have to face a young friend whose parents had
insisted all along that the president was lying.
</P>
<P>
   Very briefly, Lieberman considered asking Clinton to resign.
``But then I felt that unless things got terrible'' in terms of a
loss of public confidence, he said, ``that wasn't a decision for me
to make.'' Instead, on Sept. 3, he delivered a tough speech
condemning the president's behavior on a strictly moral, rather
than legal, plane.
</P>
<P>
   He and the president spoke several times around then, and on one
occasion ``had a long personal, even spiritual _ not to get too far
out here _ talk about his remorse and how he was trying to deal
with it.'' Then the House proceedings began, and Lieberman felt
himself getting angry again.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read the Starr report, it reawakened so many feelings
of disappointment, almost the anger of a family member when they've
done something so stupid,'' he said, clenching his hand into a fist
and releasing it. ``And as the House managers presented the
evidence, very effectively, it brought me back to why I was so
upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman was swayed by the arguments of two House managers _
Reps. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas and James Rogan of California _ he
said, and particularly bothered by two things. One was Ms.
Lewinsky's suggestion that the president's secretary, Betty Currie,
had been dispatched by Clinton to retrieve gifts he had given Ms.
Lewinsky, gifts that had been subpoenaed in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment suit.
</P>
<P>
   Second was Clinton's insistence, under oath, that he had somehow
carried on a physical relationship with Ms. Lewinsky without ever
touching her in any way that would meet a rather broad court
definition of sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he worried whether the president's actions might
be ``possibly not just a crime, but a high crime contrary to the
president's obligation to execute the laws. So while it might be
human nature to cover up an affair, it could also be an undermining
of his oath and the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   At as many as five different points, ``I could imagine myself
voting to remove him or coming close to deciding that,'' Lieberman
said. But each time, he said, ``I asked, `Is this sordid story
justification for removing a president for the first time in our
history?''' No, he thought. Nor could he get past feeling that the
public should be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is troubling,'' he said, tapping his chest, ``but
ultimately I should not be deciding about whether he committed
crimes. The framers were clear; we're not a criminal court. One of
the shortcomings of the House case is they spent almost all their
time on perjury and obstruction of justice and not enough on
whether his behavior was a high crime or misdemeanor.''
</P>
<P>
   And one of the weakest links in the case, Lieberman said, was
the focus on what Clinton told his aides: ``How could it be
obstruction to tell aides the same lies _ I hate to use that word _
the same falsehoods he was telling the American people?''
</P>
<P>
   When Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., filed his motion to dismiss the
case two weeks ago, Lieberman said, he finally forced himself to
decide. In the end, he felt overwhelmingly that Clinton's behavior
had not compromised his ability to govern in the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening, Lieberman planned to speak in the Senate,
to explain his decision and try to convince his colleagues to
provide a sense of closure by censuring the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less to condemn him and more for us and the country to
make clear that not removing him was not an exoneration,'' he said.
``We've all been through a trauma, the people and the country, and
he has, too. We've got to be about the business of reconciling,
too.''

EDITORIAL: AFTER THE VERDICT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Feb. 11:
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate nears a vote on the impeachment of President
Clinton, some small measure of dignity may still be found in what
has been a depressing and tumultuous year. That will depend
primarily on whether the Senate can muster the will and unity to
censure the president after it acquits him. It would also help if
Clinton can finally summon suitable words to describe the harm he
has done to the country and the law.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate must not bolt for the airport as soon as the trial
ends. Acquittal is the right decision, but Clinton must not go into
history without a stinging castigation by the Senate. Sens. Dianne
Feinstein and Robert Bennett have drafted a strong,
constitutionally sound censure resolution that commands broad
bipartisan support. To let a handful of opponents strangle it with
parliamentary maneuvers would deny the Senate and the nation the
chance to bring the Monica Lewinsky affair to a just and equitable
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans like Trent Lott who can see beyond the narrow
horizons of their party's most conservative members must recognize
that the Senate should have the opportunity to condemn Clinton's
misconduct even as it allows him to remain in office. If Lott, who
has maintained public silence on the issue, uses his influence as
majority leader to support a censure resolution, the Senate can
defeat the filibuster and other blocking tactics threatened by Phil
Gramm, John Ashcroft and others. Apart from his misplaced support
for secret sessions, Lott has guided the Senate through the
turbulent impeachment currents with a steady, dispassionate hand.
He will mar that record if he now lets procedural gambits kill a
measure clearly favored by a substantial majority of senators,
including many in his own party such as Olympia Snowe, Mitch
McConnell and John Chafee.
</P>
<P>
   We respect but do not share the concerns of some senators that
censure might somehow skirt the constitutional remedy for dealing
with a delinquent president. Removal is the proper way for Congress
to handle high crimes and misdemeanors. In cases like this one,
however, where the president's misconduct is wrong but does not
represent a threat to the state, a formal rebuke by the Senate does
not offend the Constitution. The framers included no bar to
censure. One of the enduring strengths of American democracy is the
flexibility that the Constitution affords the government to deal
with novel and unexpected circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The stern but judicious language chosen by Ms. Feinstein, a
Democrat, and Bennett, a Republican, carefully avoids the
constitutional prohibition against legislative acts directed
against individual citizens. Coming after completion of the trial,
approval of the resolution would also not suffer from the same
constitutional problems as the ``findings of fact'' that
Republicans at one point hoped the Senate would endorse before a
final vote on the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Ms. Snowe, the resolution contains an admonition to
future Congresses not to overturn it, as the Senate erased the
censure of President Andrew Jackson. The Snowe language, which
increases the bipartisan appeal of the measure, might be further
strengthened by adding that acquittal by the Senate should in no
way be read as excusing Clinton's misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gramm cloaks his opposition in constitutional arguments,
his intention is first to prevent wavering Republicans from voting
against the articles of impeachment in the expectation that they
will later be able to censure Clinton instead. His larger goal is
to keep Democrats from using censure to offset the impression that
they excused Clinton's behavior by acquitting him.
</P>
<P>
   But all these parochial calculations miss the larger point. The
country has had its fill of duplicity and partisan politicking in
this matter. Clinton disgraced himself and his office. Both Kenneth
Starr and the House have alienated the public. The Senate has a
chance to end the affair on an honorable note. So does Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, the nation will look to Clinton not for another
formalistic statement of remorse, but for an honest reckoning with
his abuse of the law and the gravity of the impeachment
proceedings. The Rose Garden rally that followed the House
impeachment vote in December was repugnant. This time Clinton needs
to step alone before the cameras and tell the American people he
knows he was not faithful to the law and understands that his
presidency has been tarnished. Only then can he try to regain the
trust of the people. &QL;

POLICE SEARCHING FOR MISSING TEENS WHO MAY HAVE JOINED CULT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE OLAFSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE JACKSON, Texas _ Police were scrambling Wednesday to
determine whether two teen-age girls _ who left goodbye notes in
their bedrooms before they disappeared _ may have fallen under the
spell of religious cultists.
</P>
<P>
   So far, investigators said, the disappearance of Harmony Olachia
and Nicole Conrad can be labeled nothing more sinister than a case
of two runaways.
</P>
<P>
   Still, authorities were taking unusual steps to make sure no
foul play is involved in the girls' vanishing.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Jackson is about 30 miles south of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-olds have not been home since Monday after a weekend
in which they asked their parents, among other things, whether the
so-called Y2K millennium bug signaled the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The girls, described by their parents as churchgoing Christians,
left handwritten farewell notes telling their parents that they
were following God's command to leave home and asking that they not
be reported to police as runaways.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, however, that's exactly what police are calling them.
</P>
<P>
   The girls' disappearance coincides with the weekend visit of a
longtime friend of the Olachia family and her new husband, who
reportedly were on their way to a religious retreat in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The parents believe the couple convinced the teen-agers to leave
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Police, however, are not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we can't prove it's nothing more than runaways,''
said Lake Jackson police Lt. Dale Davis. ``We still can't prove
these people left with (the couple).``
</P>
<P>
   Davis said police have been unable to confirm that the couple
are affiliated with any sort of cult, religious or otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he has five investigators working on the case and has
talked with the FBI and the State Department for help in contacting
authorities in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, before they disappeared, the girls each had
discussions with their parents about whether they should a follow a
vision from God, their parents said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Harmony fell under the influence of these people,''
said Carol Ann Olachia, 50.
</P>
<P>
   The missing girls spent three hours Saturday talking with the
visiting couple, the Olachias said. They said the woman, 21, is a
longtime friend of the family who recently was discharged from the
Coast Guard and has been living with her 27-year-old husband near
Pensacola, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The Olachias, however, said they have no idea what matters were
discussed between the couple and the girls. They said the couple
never expressed any strong religious beliefs concerning doomsday
predictions, including the so-called Y2K millennium bug _ the
belief by some people that computers will malfunction at the start
of the year 2000, possibly threatening governments and economic
systems with collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had nothing to tell us something was wrong,'' said Ray
Olachia, 56, a retired maintenance foreman at Dow Chemical Co.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of both girls expressed doubt that the handwritten
goodbye letters were genuine and said the thoughts expressed in
them were the products of brainwashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A practiced speech is what it was,'' said Nicole's father,
Craig Conrad, 39.
</P>
<P>
   No arrest warrants have been issued against the Florida couple
or an unidentified third man who was traveling with them, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police have notified authorities, however, to detain the brown
Ford pickup they reportedly are driving that bears Texas license
plate XHV95R.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping they get stopped,'' said Davis of the Lake
Jackson police. ``If they haven't crossed the border yet, they're
not going to now without getting stopped.``

DETAILS OF REPORT SUGGEST FURTHER DEALS

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Olympic officials boast that the time-honored
practice of rich countries helping athletes from poor countries is
the noblest expression of the ideal of a global ``Olympic family.''
</P>
<P>
   But buried in the report about Salt Lake City Olympic
organizers' ethical lapses is an e-mail exchange that casts a far
more nefarious light on the US Olympic Committee and its motives
for providing financial aid to Third World athletes. The e-mails
suggest US support for Sudanese runners was linked to a vote by an
International Olympic Committee member from Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The report released Tuesday also details how a former top USOC
official who was involved in the e-mail exchange had secret
consulting deals with Salt Lake organizers and funneled money to an
IOC member.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the consulting contracts and the e-mail messages
raise larger questions about whether the USOC was more deeply
involved than previously known in the questionable practices that
have rocked the Olympic movement. At the very least, they suggest
that the USOC _ which has largely escaped criticism in the scandal
_ countenanced a see-no-evil climate in which corruption
flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the new focus on the activities of the USOC puts a
different spin on the longstanding dependency between rich and poor
Olympic countries. While it long has been billed as an altruistic
system of sharing wealth, the new information suggests the
financial support has at least as much to do with bolstering the
candidacies of would-be Olympic host cities.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tuesday's report, by an independent ethics panel of
the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, appeared likely to trigger more
expulsions of IOC members. The report linked an additional 10 IOC
members to the scandal, bringing to 24 the number under scrutiny;
nine already have resigned or been expelled. There were 115 members
before the revelations began in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IOC remains fully committed to investigating and taking
action based on all available evidence,'' the IOC said in a
statement Wednesday from Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, a top USOC official acknowledged that
the e-mails leave the impression of an attempt to buy the vote of
an IOC member, but he insisted that was not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes things are done innocently, and 10 years later, you
see them under a different spotlight and you see them in a
different context,'' said USOC executive director Dick Schultz.
``The e-mails are unfortunate in that they have a tendency to
create a scenario that I don't think existed.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail exchange involved a deal made in 1993 and 1994 under
which Salt Lake Olympic organizers agreed to pay the training
expenses of three Sudanese athletes who planned to compete in the
1996 Summer Games in Atlanta. The payments, which ultimately
reached $40,000, began in October 1994 and continued until August
1996, when the Atlanta Games were held.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1995, six months after Salt Lake had been awarded the
2002 Winter Olympics, local organizers were looking to unload the
Sudanese athletes' expenses on the USOC. On Nov. 11, 1995, three
USOC officials discussed that proposal in an exchange of computer
messages.
</P>
<P>
   First, Alfredo LaMont, then the USOC's director of international
relations and protocol, wrote an e-mail to Jim Page, the USOC's
assistant executive director for sport. In it, LaMont stressed that
``we need to help pay our debt to the Sudanese IOC members.''
</P>
<P>
   Page balked at picking up those costs and inquired how the debt
was acquired. In response, LaMont wrote, ``A lot of promises were
made to secure votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Page wrote that he feared the money for Sudanese runners
would take resources away from US athletes. LaMont dismissed the
concern by saying, ``You can take it away from the additional
revenue we will ALL benefit from after having won the 2002 Games
for SLC.''
</P>
<P>
   With Page and LaMont at odds, in stepped Tom Wilkinson, the
USOC's executive director for administration. He wrote an e-mail
that said flatly, ``Seems to me a deal is a deal and Sudan
delivered. Games aren't that far away. Seriously doubt these three
guys will take anything away from any athlete we have training
here. May need Sudan again in the future. Don't burn bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the ballot was secret, there is no way to know whether
Sudan ``delivered.'' Sudan's IOC member, General Zein El Abdin
Mohamed Ahmed Abdel Gadir, was among those expelled. The Salt Lake
report said he received $17,000 in tuition payments for a son and
$7,000 in cash for a fictitious daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Wilkinson and Page at the USOC were not returned
Wednesday. Attempts to reach LaMont were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Adding fuel to concerns about the USOC's role in questionable
activities were separate revelations that led to LaMont's
resignation from the USOC last month.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he was working for the USOC, the report says,
LaMont was involved with a company called Citius. The company won a
contract with the Salt Lake organizers to arrange meetings and
lobby IOC members before the vote on the host city for the 1998
Winter Games. From March 1990 to May 1991, Citius received nine
checks from the Salt Lake bid committee totaling $25,714.35.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake lost out to Nagano, Japan, in that round of voting.
But when it launched a new effort to win the 2002 Games, LaMont was
back in business. The report said another company connected to
LaMont, Arca Inc., was paid $18,185.90 between February 1992 and
October 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Records from the Salt Lake bid committee did not detail what
services Arca provided, but they indicate that $3,000 monthly
payments were made through the company to Austin Sealy, an IOC
member from Barbados.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said he was satisfied that new policies on the
activities of Olympic bid cities _ adopted in November 1997, a year
before the current controversy began _ are adequate to prevent
future misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said the USOC might further tighten those rules based
on recommendations from a committee headed by former US Senator
George Mitchell. That panel's report is due by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to come out of this and say if there's something
we've done wrong, we hope to change those things and make sure they
don't happen again,'' Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
   He said one possible change would be to eliminate financial aid
from bid cities to foreign athletes, the very relationship that led
to the USOC e-mail exchange about Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whether other revelations are forthcoming, the
e-mails and LaMont's outside activities threaten to undermine the
USOC's attempts to keep itself clear from the tumult involving Salt
Lake City and the IOC. That might prove difficult, particularly
considering the USOC's close ties to the SLOC.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC is the body that named Salt Lake as the US choice to
host the 1998 and 2002 Games, and the USOC holds 10 seats on the
SLOC's board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC and SLOC also are partners in the Olympic Properties of
the US program, known as OPUS, the sponsorship-marketing-business
entity that coordinates all Olympic commercial and fund-raising
activities in the United States.

COMPANIES PLAN TO CONTINUE SUPPORT DESPITE OLYMPIC SCANDAL

<P>
   Despite a warning shot from a significant sponsor _ the John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. _ and nearly two months of bad
publicity for the Olympics, major companies are continuing to
support the games by spending marketing budgets on television
advertising and sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   An array of marketing experts and Olympic and television
officials said that even while various Olympic committees continue
to grapple with allegations of corruption, corporate support is
likely to be unwavering, at least through the summer. That's
because the games offer enormous access to an international market
with broad demographics for their corporate messages, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to assessing the value of the Olympics, I don't
think one considers it in the context of the moment,'' said Carl
Langsenkap, manager of public relations for Xerox, which has
sponsored Olympics since 1964 and is currently negotiating to
sponsor the 2002 winter games in Salt Lake City and the 2004 summer
games in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``One considers the value by looking at what the Olympic
movement has always been, an international gathering of athletes
and their profound achievements on a world stage,'' Langenskap
said. ``That is likely to continue to be how the average person
continues to view the Olympics, despite the current trouble,
especially once the games themselves begin.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee has implicated 14 members in
questionable activities, including accepting large gratuities, in
connection with the decision on where the winter games would be
played in 2002. An ethics committee in Salt Lake City Tuesday
implicated an additional 10.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Hancock's president and chief operating officer,
David D'Alessandro, confirmed Wednesday that the company has halted
negotiations with NBC over commercial time for the 2000 summer
games. And D'Alessandro said he intends to increase pressure to
reform the way the IOC does business by threatening its revenue
sources _ even to the extent of reviewing whether Hancock should
spend its sports marketing dollars on Major League Baseball and
NCAA basketball rather than the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions on whether to support the Olympics, at what industry
observers said is a rate of about $50 million, ``will be made over
the next 12 to 18 months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, if you want to get the attention of somebody in
business, whom you are sending money, the best way is to stop
sending them money,'' D'Alessandro said. ``And the real money
behind the Olympics is television and the sponsorships.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro said that it was the failure of the IOC and its
President Juan Antonio Samaranch to fully investigate events
leading to the siting of the summer games in Sydney, Australia in
2000 persuaded him to increase the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've said is that there are expectations based on what
Samaranch said he would do in January when he apologized and said
all allegations would be investigated,'' D'Alessandro said. ``So
far, the results have not been that.''
</P>
<P>
   But observers of the sports marketing industry and spokesmen for
several other Olympic sponsors said Wednesday that no other company
is likely to follow Hancock's lead on halting television
negotiations or altering sponsorship agreements. Some companies,
like UPS and Xerox, which are currently negotiating agreements with
the IOC, said the allegations are having no impact.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Coca-cola, UPS, Xerox and Panasonic all said
Wednesday that, while they continue to monitor events, they have no
plans to withdraw any support from the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will probably all go away by June or July,'' said Rob
Prezmark, a senior vice-president at IMG, a huge international
advertising and marketing agency, who once negotiated with Hancock
on behalf of the IOC. ``If not, then this will be a big problem.
But my opinion is that when Sydney opens, that day, this will
totally be by the books and the attention will be entirely on the
games, as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, spokesmen for both NBC and the IOC said that no one
has followed Hancock's lead, and that advertising negotations for
the summer games in Sydney in 2000 are proceeding well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Olympic ad sales have been very strong,'' said Ed Markey,
a spokesman for the network, who echoed similar comments by Michael
R. Payne, the IOC's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had no erosion,'' Markey said. ``And the sponsors
understand the viewers watch the Olympics by the tens of millions
on a nightly basis because of their allure and because of the
events themselves.''

PENTAGON CITES RISKS OF GOING INTO KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
   (See also KOSOVO-TALKS) 
(jw) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as NATO contemplates sending peacekeepers to
Kosovo, senior Pentagon officials are raising serious concerns
about sending American troops into a hostile region of Serbia
without clear-cut military goals.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Pentagon officials expressed worries about casualties and
about what they described as the lack of a strategy for quickly
removing peacekeepers from Kosovo, a war-ravaged ethnic Albanian
province in southern Serbia. These officials cite continuing
confusion at peace talks in France about the exact military
objectives in dealing with what amounts to a civil war within
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a strong desire for there to be a focus, with a
definite plan in hand, before a decision is made to commit as
opposed to going in with a vague idea that it will work out,'' said
a senior military official. Senior Pentagon officials are making
such concerns known to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials debate whether the Pentagon has enough forces to
support a NATO commitment in Kosovo, given U.S. commitments around
the globe, including policing a no-flight zone in Iraq and an
armistice in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we big enough to do what we are already doing, much less
to do more in Kosovo?'' another senior Pentagon official asked.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Pentagon's concerns were echoed Wednesday at a House
hearing on a U.S. role in a Kosovo settlement. After Clinton
administration officials described a plan that could send as many
as 4,000 U.S. ground troops to Kosovo to enforce a peace agreement,
several members of Congress questioned whether this would be
another drawn-out commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such solutions do not eliminate the underlying problem; they
promise to drag on indefinitely, at high cost to our own nation,''
said Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., chairman of the House
International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   For now, President Clinton appears to be heeding military
warnings, refusing to commit troops, even as U.S. diplomats push
for the nation's involvement at peace talks between the Yugoslav
government and ethnic Albanians in Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't yet have an agreement so we don't know with any
certainty what is the security environment,'' said a Pentagon
official. ``It does no one any good to do an exercise in wishful
thinking without a meeting of minds.``
</P>
<P>
   Walter Slocombe, the undersecretary of defense for policy,
argued that solving the Kosovo conflict was in ``America's security
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo conflict could widen and engulf the Balkans in more
warfare, he said, sparking renewed violence in Bosnia ``where we
have invested a great deal and made a great deal of progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Some senior military officials, however, have yet to be
convinced that deploying troops to Kosovo would be in the vital
national interest.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to calling on the United States for troops, NATO is
planning for a possible peacekeeping mission includes about 8,000
troops from Britain, 5,000 from France and 2,800 from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time there is a significant troop deployment, we are
very concerned about questions like the desired end and what is the
command-and-control structure,'' said Capt. Michael Doubleday, a
spokesman at the Pentagon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the hearing Wednesday, Thomas Pickering, undersecretary of
state for political affairs, reiterated that the Clinton
administration believed the president could dispatch U.S. troops
for a peacekeeping mission without seeking formal congressional
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has broad authority,'' he said, ``to act in the
national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pickering added that officials were ``not seeking to
introduce American ground forces into a situation in which they
would have to engage in combat'' to attain an objective.
</P>
<P>
   That is the exactly the sort of promise that Pentagon military
planners say causes them to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Ivo Daalder, a Balkans specialist formerly at the National
Security Council, said that any mission to Kosovo ``is going to be
a really tough job in which people will get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The backlash will be tremendous if they aren't up front about
how serious this is,'' said Daalder, now with the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying these military concerns are questions about who is at
fault in this war and what that means for an American involvement.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony last week, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said
that ``the notion that somehow only the Serbs have engaged in
atrocities is incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that the ethnic Albanian forces in Kosovo were
responsible for the majority of recent cease-fire violations.
Although small in scale, these violations produced ``a reaction by
the Serbs, who characteristically then engage in the kind of
brutality we've seen,'' Cohen said. ``So it has been on both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony Wednesday, Pickering said that Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic ``raised the stakes one year ago by instituting
a crackdown against the civilian population of Kosovo, killing
hundreds of people and driving thousands from their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of private groups working on Kosovo who consult with
officials at both the State and Defense departments say they have
noted the patterns of violations and responses for the last several
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pentagon approaches the question with a box-checking
mentality,'' said John Hooper, executive director of Balkans Watch.
``The majority of violations were from the Kosovo Albanians. But
they were not the ones to displace 600,000 people from their homes,
did not destroy over 19,000 homes and about 490 villages. All of
that has been done by the Serbs.''

ELITE NAVY TEAM DISPATCHED TO DESTROY FUEL ON STRANDED SHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The emergency summons to ignite 400,000 gallons of fuel aboard a
stranded ship came by telephone late Tuesday night to an elite Navy
unit at Whidbey Island Naval Air Station near Oak Harbor, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   While Wednesday's mission _ destroying the fuel carried by the
639-foot-long New Carissa off Coos Bay, Ore. _ is unusual for its
magnitude and high visibility, the Navy explosive experts are
accustomed to emergency calls for help at all hours, said Cmdr. Sue
Fitzgerald, commanding officer of Explosive Ordnance Disposal
Mobile Unit 11 at Whidbey Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our operations are dangerous assignments,'' Fitzgerald
said. ``But this has been an interesting week.''
</P>
<P>
   The unit consists of 17 officers and 108 enlisted specialists
who are trained to detect, identify and dispose of explosive
hazards to people or property on land and under water. They also
provide support to the U.S. Secret Service in protecting government
officials, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent operations have included recovering and disposing
of loaded maritime flares that washed ashore on the coast, removing
World War II-era ordance discovered during construction projects
and helping the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service retrieve a small
chartered aircraft that crashed into the Columbia River.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Wednesday's environmental rescue mission in Oregon the
first time the team has been sent to destroy a stranded ship's
fuel. The team carried out a similar operation in Alaska in the
late 1980s, she said.
</P>
<P>
   An all-volunteer organization within the Navy, EOD recruits must
pass a tough physical test, demonstrate strong swimming skills and
undergo more than a year of training in ordnance handling,
demolition and safety practices, including work on nuclear and
chemical weapons, Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   Its members must be qualified in scuba diving, parachuting and
helicopter operations, and are trained in small-unit infantry
tactics for defense in hostile areas.
</P>
<P>
   There are less than 1,000 Explosive Ordnance Disposal
specialists in the entire Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The Whidbey-based command is organized into several squad-sized
detachments that specialize in different aspects of ordnance
disposal, Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   The six-member team sent to Coos Bay was the unit's ``Detachment
Northwest,'' a shore-based component organized and trained to
respond to emergencies throughout the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The unit is commanded by Navy Lt. Scot Wilson, 38, a career
explosive ordnance disposal specialist who joined the Navy 15 years
ago as an enlisted man but won an officer's commission through a
Navy-sponsored college program at the University of Washington in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Eight five-member detachments train for deployment with Navy
carrier battle groups, serving as ordnance disposal technicians for
the carrier and its escorts. Two of the five-member teams are
currently serving in the Persian Gulf aboard the carrier USS Carl
Vinson.
</P>
<P>
   These detachments attracted news coverage during Operation
Desert Storm when they were called in to detonate Iraqi anti-ship
mines that were found floating loose in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Other elements include a detachment specializing in countering
sea mines, and two additional shore-based teams at the Bangor
Submarine Base in Kitsap County, Wash., and Fallon Naval Air
Station in Nevada _ two bases with large amounts of explosives in
storage.

SPORTS COLUMN: SKATER TAKES HER CAREER TRIPLE JUMP

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Sarah Hughes tries not to look at the graceful
woman on the ice with her. That would be bad form, in both senses.
</P>
<P>
   By the luck of the draw, 13-year-old Sarah Hughes has been put
in the same group as 18-year-old Michelle Kwan, the gold standard
of competitive figure skating these days.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer when the Goodwill Games were held near her home in
Kings Point, New York, Hughes spotted Kwan in a sushi restaurant
but was so tongue-tied that her 20-year-old sister, Rebecca, had to
do all the chatting.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the two skate here in the short program of the
national championships. Kwan, as defending champion, competes
against herself, while Hughes, making her first appearance in the
women's division, is a legitimate possibility for a medal.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes is performing the equivalent of a career triple axel,
triple toe, leaping from junior skating to women's skating at 13
because, as she accurately notes, ``There's nowhere else to go.''
She won the national junior title last year in Philadelphia and
finished second in the world juniors in Croatia last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go backward, or just stand still,'' Hughes
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night she skates in the same group as Kwan, a mature
and flowing presence who graciously accepted her silver medal
behind Tara Lipinski in the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, a
year ago. Now Kwan is back, keeping her gold-medal options open for
2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the world and national champion, she's so great,'' said
Hughes, who can still muster up a 13-year-old's sense of awe.
``Sure, I know she's on the ice, but I don't look at her much. That
would not be very efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes is nothing if not efficient. She defies skating
convention by actually living at home and going to Great Neck
Middle School, having a real life with her parents and five
siblings, while enduring dreadful traffic jams to find quality ice
time across two bridges in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   She's a trouper who was once asked what she liked best about
skating and replied with a perfectly Zenlike ``the ice.'' She says
her two goals in life are a perfect 6.0 score in skating and a
perfect 1,600 in her scholastic tests.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing perfection, Hughes spent two weeks with Kwan's coach,
Frank Carroll, out in California last summer while Kwan was on
vacation. But this is no gunslinger competition, with Kwan looking
over her shoulders for her skating assassin, the Woman Who Shot
Liberty Valance. ``She talks to me,'' Hughes reported. ``She wanted
to know what grade I was in, and I told her I was still in middle
school. She wanted to know if I had finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes admits there is a temptation to glance at Kwan during
practice, when six skaters take designated turns rehearsing their
routines, while the others keep out of the way, at least
theoretically.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic practice took on a macabre aura in Norway in 1994 when
Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding wound up in the same practice
group, and Kerrigan reasonably had to wonder if Harding would be
packing a tire iron. International warmups always were enlivened by
Surya Bonaly unloading a backward flip in the general direction of
somebody's jugular.
</P>
<P>
   But there is none of that here, just one gold-medal prospect and
a lot of hopefuls. When Nicole Bobek withdrew the other day because
she just wasn't fit, Hughes said, ``It was horrible because Nicole
has put so much into skating, but that means there's another spot
on the podium.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no reverse psychology in skating as there was in tennis
when Tracy Austin's mother dressed her in oversize pinafores and
dangling pigtails to obscure the killer within. Last year Hughes
was doing four triples in junior competition and now she is doing
seven, but the judges will annihilate her if she tries to perform
beyond her years, or her girlish frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only so much passion you can have at 13,'' said Robin
Wagner, her coach from Manhasset, N.Y. ``Why try to look 15 or 17?
That would be silly. But there is so much beauty in her skating. I
just want that to come through.'' Her accomplished family keeps her
balanced. The oldest child, Rebecca, the editor of the weekly
Independent at Harvard University, enjoys watching Sarah conduct
interviews with poise far beyond the practiced sing-song neutrality
of most female skaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to remember she's only 13,'' Rebecca Hughes said.
``But when I take her shopping, I'm reminded.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen is a tricky age. Sarah Hughes would be quite happy to
stand on that podium and look up at Michelle Kwan. She already
does. &QL;

 Citigroup, Tired of Living in Visa's Shadow, Switches
to  MasterCard  By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Citigroup's move to shift its mammoth credit card business from
Visa to archrival MasterCard is seen as a bid to reshape the
industry by shifting power and visibility from credit card
associations to banks.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, the No. 2 issuer of Visa cards, wanted the
association to get out of the marketing business and focus mainly
on the unglamorous job of processing card transactions, Michael
Beindorff, Visa U.S.A.'s executive vice president for marketing,
said in an interview. ``There are two distinct business models
emerging. They want to change (Visa's) role and mission, reducing
the organization to a network processor,'' Beindorff said.
</P>
<P>
   That would represent a reversal of the role that Visa of Foster
City and MasterCard of New York have played for more than two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Both are membership associations that, over the years, became
more powerful than their members, the thousands of financial
institutions that actually issue credit cards. Since their
inceptions, Visa and MasterCard have spent billions of dollars
advertising their brand names and forging identities more widely
recognized than the institutions that actually extend credit to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, which holds nearly 17 percent of all Visa's
outstanding balances, is anxious to promote its own name as a
global financial brand and doesn't want to share attention with
Visa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing that for 20 years, we've been willing to live
with a communal-association brand so prominently displayed,'' John
Reed, Citigroup co-chairman, said in response to an analyst's
question recently.
</P>
<P>
   Credit card experts said the break between Visa and its
second-largest issuer will have have little direct effect on
consumers because MasterCard is accepted almost everywhere Visa is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like a wash for consumers,'' said Stephen Brobeck,
director of the Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute reflects the growing clout of Visa's largest
issuers, whose share of the association's business has ballooned
because of bank mergers. The top four Visa issuers now hold more
than half of Visa's total outstanding balances.
</P>
<P>
   Small banks, meanwhile, strongly support Visa's marketing
efforts because their own names are not well known.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of VISA11 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``If you devalue the Visa card, you devalue the franchise of
community banks,'' said Ken Guenther, executive vice president of
Independent Bankers Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Beindorff said Citigroup and Visa have been negotiating for more
than a year over fees and terms of the bank's membership.
</P>
<P>
   Visa was willing to accept Citigroup's demand to remove the Visa
name from the front of credit cards, leaving that space exclusively
for Citigroup, Beindorff said. But the association balked when the
bank insisted that its fees be slashed and that Visa cut back its
marketing activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``A line gets drawn in the sand,'' Beindorff said.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup paid Visa $73 million in membership dues and
processing fees last year, about 6 percent of the association's
revenue, Beindorff said. Visa, whose income has been growing at a
17 percent annual rate in recent years, will be able to absorb the
lost revenue without major program cuts or layoffs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Reed and a second Citigroup official quit the board
of Visa U.S.A., one of several regional Visa units.
</P>
<P>
   The resignations signaled that Citigroup has reached an
agreement with MasterCard on fees and marketing issues and that the
bank will stop issuing new Visa cards except when it has contracts
that force it to do so, according to several news reports.
Citigroup spokeswoman Maria Mendler declined to discuss the bank's
arrangements with MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup hasn't formally notified Visa that it will stop
issuing new Visa cards but ``it's a pretty safe bet'' it will,
Beindorff said.
</P>
<P>
   MasterCard is smaller than Visa, controling about a quarter of
payment card volume compared with Visa's market share of more than
50 percent. Industry experts speculated that MasterCard agreed to
Citigroup's demands in order to win the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citigroup is going to an association where it will be top
dog,'' said David Robertson, president of the Nilson Report, a
newsletter covering the credit card industry.

COMPANIES PLAN TO CONTINUE SUPPORT DESPITE OLYMPIC SCANDAL

<P>
   Despite a warning shot from a significant sponsor _ the John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. _ and nearly two months of bad
publicity for the Olympics, major companies are continuing to
support the games by spending marketing budgets on television
advertising and sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   An array of marketing experts and Olympic and television
officials said that even while various Olympic committees continue
to grapple with allegations of corruption, corporate support is
likely to be unwavering, at least through the summer. That's
because the games offer enormous access to an international market
with broad demographics for their corporate messages, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to assessing the value of the Olympics, I don't
think one considers it in the context of the moment,'' said Carl
Langsenkap, manager of public relations for Xerox, which has
sponsored Olympics since 1964 and is currently negotiating to
sponsor the 2002 winter games in Salt Lake City and the 2004 summer
games in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   ``One considers the value by looking at what the Olympic
movement has always been, an international gathering of athletes
and their profound achievements on a world stage,'' Langenskap
said. ``That is likely to continue to be how the average person
continues to view the Olympics, despite the current trouble,
especially once the games themselves begin.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee has implicated 14 members in
questionable activities, including accepting large gratuities, in
connection with the decision on where the winter games would be
played in 2002. An ethics committee in Salt Lake City Tuesday
implicated an additional 10.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Hancock's president and chief operating officer,
David D'Alessandro, confirmed Wednesday that the company has halted
negotiations with NBC over commercial time for the 2000 summer
games. And D'Alessandro said he intends to increase pressure to
reform the way the IOC does business by threatening its revenue
sources _ even to the extent of reviewing whether Hancock should
spend its sports marketing dollars on Major League Baseball and
NCAA basketball rather than the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions on whether to support the Olympics, at what industry
observers said is a rate of about $50 million, ``will be made over
the next 12 to 18 months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, if you want to get the attention of somebody in
business, whom you are sending money, the best way is to stop
sending them money,'' D'Alessandro said. ``And the real money
behind the Olympics is television and the sponsorships.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro said that it was the failure of the IOC and its
President Juan Antonio Samaranch to fully investigate events
leading to the siting of the summer games in Sydney, Australia in
2000 persuaded him to increase the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've said is that there are expectations based on what
Samaranch said he would do in January when he apologized and said
all allegations would be investigated,'' D'Alessandro said. ``So
far, the results have not been that.''
</P>
<P>
   But observers of the sports marketing industry and spokesmen for
several other Olympic sponsors said Wednesday that no other company
is likely to follow Hancock's lead on halting television
negotiations or altering sponsorship agreements. Some companies,
like UPS and Xerox, which are currently negotiating agreements with
the IOC, said the allegations are having no impact.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Coca-cola, UPS, Xerox and Panasonic all said
Wednesday that, while they continue to monitor events, they have no
plans to withdraw any support from the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will probably all go away by June or July,'' said Rob
Prezmark, a senior vice-president at IMG, a huge international
advertising and marketing agency, who once negotiated with Hancock
on behalf of the IOC. ``If not, then this will be a big problem.
But my opinion is that when Sydney opens, that day, this will
totally be by the books and the attention will be entirely on the
games, as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, spokesmen for both NBC and the IOC said that no one
has followed Hancock's lead, and that advertising negotations for
the summer games in Sydney in 2000 are proceeding well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Olympic ad sales have been very strong,'' said Ed Markey,
a spokesman for the network, who echoed similar comments by Michael
R. Payne, the IOC's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had no erosion,'' Markey said. ``And the sponsors
understand the viewers watch the Olympics by the tens of millions
on a nightly basis because of their allure and because of the
events themselves.''

REPUBLICAN SUPPORT FOR CONVICTION ERODES ON 2ND DAY OF
DELIBERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET) 
(See related stories: IMPEACH-DEBATE, IMPEACH-SCENE,

(sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate privately debated for a second day
whether to remove President Clinton from office, Republican support
for conviction began cracking and an effort to censure the
President had virtually died.
</P>
<P>
   Three Republican moderates, Sens. James Jeffords of Vermont,
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and John Chafee of Rhode Island, said
they would oppose both the perjury and obstruction of justice
charges. Two more Republicans said they would vote for obstruction
but against the perjury charge, all but assuring that the perjury
article would not receive a simple majority of 51 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords said the president obstructed justice but that it did
not rise to an removable offense. The senator predicted that as
many as six other Republicans would vote against both charges, a
forecast that if correct would mean the article on obstruction
could also fail to get a majority, much less the 67 votes required
for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords said he tried in his speech on the floor of the Senate
on Wednesday to persuade his Republican colleagues not to buckle to
pressure to convict the president. ``I wanted to assure some people
who were on the edge that it would be important to make sure that
we don't set a precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   At midday, after some of the Republican defections were known,
Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, issued a terse, cryptic
statement that did not announce how he would vote. With his aides
insisting that Lott was not trying to influence votes, the
statement acknowledged: ``The evidence shows that the president has
committed perjury and obstructed justice. The only question left
is, will the Senate vote to find him guilty of these high crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lott said at another point on Wednesday that, if at all
possible, the Senate would hold the final votes by 5 p.m. on
Thursday, a top Republican aide said on Wednesday night that it was
increasingly likely that the final votes would be on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, about 50 senators had walked to the well of the
chamber to explain their views, with Democrats more outspoken than
Republicans. A common Democratic theme was attacking Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel, and the House prosecutors, a refrain
senators repeated in the corridors and in news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, denounced the case as ``one of the most
blatant political vindictive actions taken by the House of
Representatives since Andrew Johnson's case was pushed through by
the radical Republicans of his time and forced upon the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two other Senate Republicans, Ted Stevens of Alaska and
Slade Gorton of Washington, have said they will vote for the
obstruction of justice count, but not the perjury charge.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's acquittal fairly certain, senators alloted 15
minutes each spoke to a chamber cleared of reporters and
spectators, offering their arguments in impassioned and prosaic
speeches why the president should be convicted and expelled, or
exonerated of the crimes leveled against him.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's session of six and a half hours, senators
delivered a steady stream of speeches, but rarely engaged in real
deliberations. Even Lott, who favored closing the Senate's doors to
encourage a lively give-and-take in the first presidential
impeachment trial in 131 years, conceded at midday that that had
not happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point deliberations may break out, kind of like
smallpox,'' Lott said with a chuckle. ``If we have 100 speeches
without a lot of exchanges, that's OK, too.''

FOR AMERICAN TRAVELERS: EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Texas, Calif.)   (See also AMR-PILOTS) 
(jw) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even if American Airline pilots return to work quickly after a
federal judge ordered them Wednesday to end their five-day sickout
that grounded 2,500 flights, travelers can still expect
inconvenience and disruption during the coming long weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even a temporary settlement cannot come too soon for
airlines, passengers, cruise lines, hotels and residents of the
Caribbean, which depends heavily on tourism for economic survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``This strike was serious stuff, because this is one of the
biggest weeks of the year for Caribbean travel and American is the
biggest airline in the region,'' said Michael Youngman, executive
director of the Caribbean Tourism Organization. ``So even a
tentative settlement is an enormous relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Effective immediately, American customers can obtain a full
refund on all tickets, including nonrefundable tickets. They can
also postpone or reschedule flights without service charges or
penalties. And, when flights are canceled, American says it will
try to accommodate customers on other American flights or on other
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise industry was worried about the possibility that many
passengers booked on cruises from South Florida this weekend could
not get to Miami or Fort Lauderdale on time. ``We have 21,500
passengers booked from Miami, Fort Lauderdale and San Juan on nine
ships this weekend, and an equal equal number going home,'' said
Rich Steck, spokesman in Miami for Royal Caribbean and Celebrity
Cruises. ``So you can probably hear our sigh of relief about the
settlement all the way up in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Most business travelers apparently avoided major dislocations
during the sickout, said Norman Sherlock, executive director of the
National Business Travel Association. ``But corporate members have
told me they're going to recast their future travel plans,'' he
said, ``so as not to be so dependent on American or any single
airline.''
</P>
<P>
   Some travel agents viewed the sickout as further evidence of the
importance of their services, which are threatened by erosion from
the Internet. Rudi Steele, owner of a travel agency in Dallas, did
some juggling to get two clients to Los Angeles in time to catch a
flight to Hong Kong in order to board a cruise ship. ``I got them
on a late-night flight the night before to Ontario, Calif.,''
Steele said, ``put them up in a hotel and booked a rental car for
them to drive to L.A. in the morning.'' He could not resist adding,
``That's what a professional travel agent will do for clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Boult, vice president of supplier relations for
Rosenbluth International, added that while the Internet might be
fun for surfing for information, it was of little help in a crisis.
``Try calling the Internet and complaining that your flight's been
canceled,'' he said. Early on, Rosenbluth sent a fax to corporate
accounts, telling them of the flight cancellations and promising to
keep them informed. ``Because there were good alternatives early in
the strike,'' Boult said, ``we were able to avoid any serious
disruptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines say they will do all they can to accommodate stranded
American passengers, but add that they do not have spare planes to
press into service, as is often believed. Moreover, work rules and
airport regulations prevent the scheduling of additional flights
except in unusual circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines booked more than 1,000 hotel rooms in Miami on
Tuesday for stranded passengers, but by and large the strike seemed
to be a mixed blessing for hotels, with no-shows offsetting the
number of guests who extended their stays after their flights were
canceled. However, the sickout hurt the 1,369-room Hyatt Regency
hotel at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport. ``Fifty percent of our
business is small meetings, booked 10 to 14 days in advance,'' said
Steve Trent, the hotel's general manager. ``We've had
cancellations, and we stood to lose an a lot more business if the
strike continued, because this is a busy season for conventions in
Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   When he learned of the judge's order to end the sickout, Trent
had a one-word reaction: ``Hallelujah!''

 &HT;    Conviction votes expected to fall short of majority
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three Republican moderates said Wednesday they will
vote to acquit President Clinton on both impeachment articles as
hopes waned that senators will wrap up secret deliberations and
take the historic vote today.
</P>
<P>
   While it is a foregone conclusion that the Senate will not
muster the two-thirds majority to convict Clinton, the trickle of
public statements Wednesday raised the prospect that the verdict
could fall short of a 51-vote majority.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Jeffords (R-Vt.) said he would vote against both
articles, and Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) said he would vote ``not
proven,'' a vote Specter conceded would be recorded as not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Chafee (R-R.I.) said House prosecutors did not prove
their case that Clinton lied before the grand jury Aug. 17 or
obstructed justice in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
Clinton is accused of perjury and obstruction of justice in his
attempts to conceal his relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton carried Vermont, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania in the
1992 and 1996 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords predicted at least six or seven of his Republican
colleagues would also vote not guilty, meaning the two articles
would get less than 50 votes if all 45 Democrats vote against
conviction. Five Democrats announced Wednesday that they will vote
to acquit.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeffords later softened his prediction, saying, ``The
pressure is coming on to get a majority.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Majority Leader Trent Lott said there had been
no attempt by the leadership to line up votes for conviction.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton will remain in office in either case, some
Democrats said a defeat of the impeachment articles by a majority
vote would send a powerful political message.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is less than a majority (voting to convict), it will
be a strong statement that will discourage political
impeachments,'' said Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.).
</P>
<P>
   By the end of deliberations Wednesday, only half the 100-member
Senate had used their alloted 15 minutes to speak in closed
session. Though the vote on the articles could come as early as
this evening, the slow pace of deliberations suggested the trial
will probably spill into Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There were also increasing signs that the votes on the
impeachment articles will be the last statement the Senate will
make on the charges against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic bid to enlist Republican support in a censure
resolution lost steam, as neither party could agree on the
language. Democrats want strong language but words that do not
imply that Clinton broke any laws, while many Republicans say such
language is too weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of censure has lost a lot of ground,'' said Sen.
Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.). ``Most people think that when we vote on the
articles that will be the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a principal Democratic
proponent of censure, suggested for the first time Wednesday that
the censure might not be a censure at all, but simply a ``letter of
censure'' signed by concerned senators. Such a letter would have
even less legislative meaning than a censure motion voted on by the
full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way or another, this is going to see the light of day,''
Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, senators on both sides of the aisle have listened to
the same arguments from prosecutors and defense lawyers, watched
the same videotaped depositions and read from the same impeachment
record compiled by independent counsel Ken Starr and the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But what became clear Wednesday was how differently senators
view the same set of facts.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), who weeks ago called the case against
Clinton a ``pile of dung,'' stuck by his off-color remark Wednesday
and heaped scorn on Starr and the tactics of House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case should never have been brought to the United States
Senate,'' said Harkin. ``I believe it to be one of the most blatant
political vindictive actions taken by the House of Representatives
since Andrew Johnson's case was pushed through by the radical
Republicans of his time and forced upon the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkin made pointed reference to House members such as Rep. Bob
Barr (R-Ga.), who called for Clinton's impeachment even before the
independent counsel submitted his findings to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heaven forbid that I saw something improper in the president's
actions and now I'm being attacked,'' Barr responded later. ``You
can never please (Democrats).''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dick Lugar (R-Ind.) said he would vote for both articles
and called for a ``cleansing of the presidency.'' Lugar said
Clinton exposed himself to blackmail and jeopardized national
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not trustworthy,'' said Lugar. ``It will not be enough
simply to condemn the tragic misdeeds of President Clinton. He must
be removed from office.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most nuanced position came from Specter, who said he
will attempt to set a precedent and vote that the impeachment
articles were ``not proven.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsing blame all around, the Pennsylvania Republican called
Clinton's impeachment trial a ``sham trial.'' Specter said the
trial should have had live witnesses and more presentation of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not done impartial justice to House prosecutors
because we tied one hand behind their backs,'' Specter said. ``The
country has not seen a full development of the evidence. ... I
don't believe there has been an adequate trial to come to a
conclusion of not guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords said he believed Clinton did make ``misleading
statements'' and did obstruct justice but that those crimes did not
rise to the level of impeachable acts. ``A vote to convict the
president on these articles may establish a low threshold that
would make every president subject to removal for the slightest
indiscretion,'' Jeffords said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vote to convict may imperil every president who faces a
Congress controlled by the opposing party.''
</P>
<P>
   Chafee said he thought perjury and obstruction of justice were
impeachable offenses, but that House prosecutors hadn't proven
Clinton's guilt beyond doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty with each of the charges in Article II
(obstruction of justice) is that circumstantial evidence in each of
these cases is rebutted by direct evidence or by confusion that
leaves it very murky,'' Chafee said.
</P>
<P>
   In a path that many Republicans may ultimately take, Sen. Slade
Gorton (R-Wash.) said he will vote to acquit the president of
perjury but convict him of obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible to reconcile the president's course of
conduct with any purpose other than to preclude Miss Lewinsky's
truthful testimony in the Jones case,'' Gorton said. ``Obstruction
was his only motive.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.), making a plea to censure Clinton,
said he should not be removed, while Sens. Daniel Akaka (D-Hawaii),
Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) came out
strongly against convicting Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``His conduct did not threaten our constitutional system, and
the national interest will not be served by removing him from
office,'' said Lautenberg. ``These proceedings should not serve as
a precedent for using impeachment as a political weapon.''

COAST GUARD TO BURN SHIP LEAKING OIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Wash., Texas)  (Eds: Story will be updated if the Coast Guard sets fire to the
ship tonight.) 
(mk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Faced with a cargo ship leaking oil, an approaching
Pacific storm packing 70-mph winds and the threat of an
environmental debacle along beaches in two states, Coast Guard
officials decided Wednesday to set fire to the 639-foot vessel,
which ran aground late last week about 150 yards off the coast of
southern Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are significantly concerned that this ship will not stay
together,'' Capt. Mike Hall of the Coast Guard said in a briefing
Wednesday. ``We're between a rock and a hard spot. If we don't do
something now, we would have to stand before you and tell you why
we let 400,000 gallons of oil spill on our beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Cracks in the hull of the ship, the Japanese-owned New Carissa,
which had been headed to the port town of Coos Bay to pick up a
load of wood chips, have already caused mucky black oil and diesel
fuel to wash over about eight miles of Oregon coastline, Coast
Guard officials said. That oil has come ashore near a prime habitat
for the Western snowy plover, an endangered shorebird.
</P>
<P>
   The storm expected to hit Wednesday night was carrying sharp
winds and rain, and the officials decided that there was a serious
risk that the vessel would simply break apart, which could send the
remaining oil onto beaches all along the Oregon coast and northward
along the Washington coast.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, U.S. Navy explosive experts boarded the grounded
ship and prepared to set it afire with remote-controlled grenades.
The blaze was expected to last a few days.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to burn the ship in such circumstances is unusual
but not unprecedented, experts said Wednesday, and in essence
involves opting for a fire that will blacken and pollute the skies
in the area as the cost of trying to save the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any of these things, it's a trade-off,'' said Steven
Barnes, director of the National Spill Control School, a branch of
Texas A&AMP;M University in Corpus Christi, Texas. ``There's no real
technique that doesn't cause problems, but the assumption here
seems to be that the fire is less of a risk than letting that ship
sit there and be pounded to pieces in stormy seas.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups, while expressing dismay at the lack of
expanded safety regulations to prevent such spills in the first
place, said the decision to burn the ship appeared to be the proper
one under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction is that this is a terrible solution to an
even more terrible problem,'' said Allen Hershkowitz, a senior
scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a
Manhattan-based environmental group. ``This might be a sensible
last-resort option, but it really underscores the need for double
hulls and safer ships. Tragedies like this are, frankly, not
uncommon, but they are also avoidable.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting the ship afire is itself not without some risks. At
worst, the fire could undermine the ship's structural integrity,
causing it to split apart before the oil has burned off. But as of
Wednesday evening, Coast Guard officials said the ship was still
sufficiently intact, giving the fire option a high likelihood of
success.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's worst oil spill involving a ship, the March 1989
Exxon Valdez disaster, in which nearly 11 million gallons of oil
poured into Alaska's Prince William Sound, a similar approach was
considered. But storms had broken up the tanker and spread oil for
miles around, making the fire option unfeasible, Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, the New Carissa ran aground in the Leberti Hole, a
major area for commercial crabbers, and was within sight of the
beaches north of Coos Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred members of a clean-up crew, most of them
volunteers, gathered along the beaches Wednesday, picking up
oil-coated driftwood and tar-like balls from the spill. Several
oil-coated birds have been found; it is not yet clear how many
wildlife deaths have been caused by the spill, a Coast Guard
spokeswoman in Seattle said.
</P>
<P>
   In opting for the fire, the authorities have abandoned an
earlier plan to try to pull the ship free and then tow it in for
repairs. After the oil has been burned off, the burned steel hull
of the ship is expected to be towed to the beach and cut up. The
23-man crew, mostly from the Philippines, was safely removed from
the ship last Friday and has been interviewed by the Coast Guard,
which is still trying to piece together exactly how the ship ran
aground.
</P>
<P>
   The fire plan ``is not a perfect solution,'' said Jacqueline
Savitz, director of the Coast Alliance, a conservation group based
in Washington, D.C., noting that it will likely destroy a wide
swath of fish and larval sea life near the ocean's surface.

WORLD BANK'S INTERNAL REPORT CRITICIZES RESPONSE TOWARD INDONESIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also INDONESIA-TIMOR, INDONESIA-FERRY) 
(rk) 
 By   DAVID SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a blistering evaluation of its own operations in
Indonesia, the World Bank concludes that its officials ignored
corruption, growing repression and a collapsing financial system in
the final years of President Suharto's 33-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   The internal report, completed last week and made available to
The New York Times, says that the bank knew of many problems but
did not want to offend Suharto's government or threaten the image
the World Bank had promoted of Indonesia as one of its great
success stories.
</P>
<P>
   The nation is one of the leading recipients of bank lending.
Over three decades, the World Bank spent more than $25 billion in
development projects in the vast nation, and watched with pride as
the share of the population living beneath the poverty line shrank
from 60 percent in 1970 to less than 11 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the report concludes that Indonesia's rapid growth created a
``halo effect'' in its relations with Suharto that made the World
Bank's top managers unwilling to deliver tough messages to the
aging leader. It documents how country specialists continued to
issue rosy reports to the headquarters in Washington even after a
financial crisis spread through Southeast Asia in the fall of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And it recounts how its sister institution, the International
Monetary Fund, ``reached a stage of open confrontation'' with
Suharto a year ago, as he attempted to save his family and friends
from financial ruin at the expense of the country's economic
future. Suharto resigned under pressure last May.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian officials who saw an earlier version of the report
objected to many of its findings.
</P>
<P>
   The report was written by a unit that is supposed to provide an
independent assessment of the World Bank's performance in
developing nations. It reports directly to the World Bank's board,
and has been given greater powers since James Wolfensohn, the World
Bank's president, began an overhaul four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment comes at a time of enormous debate about how the
World Bank and IMF should have responded to the upheavals that
began in Thailand in July 1997 and have spread across three
continents.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank once offered glowing reports of its successes in
Indonesia, where it has helped build electric power systems, ports
and highways, and lent billions for primary education.
</P>
<P>
   But now the report concludes that the World Bank's overall
success was only ``marginally satisfactory,'' largely because it
paid too little attention to a sick banking system and Suharto's
refusal to reform the legal system and open up the political
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Issues of poor governance, social stress and a weak financial
sector were not addressed,'' the report found. It suggests that
part of the problem was the World Bank's ``special relationship''
with Suharto himself.
 &UR;  &LR; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The implicit message of the findings is one the World Bank and
the IMF are struggling with in Indonesia and elsewhere around the
world: Should aid be withheld from countries that are refusing to
follow the institutions' advice, either on governance or financial
management?
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has periodically withheld small amounts of money from
Russia and other nations that have refused to live up to their
financial agreements, and the World Bank has sometimes ended aid to
countries for projects that were considered a threat to the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   But both the World Bank and the IMF are loathe to criticize
their ``clients'' in public, for fear of poisoning their
relationship with the nations' leaders or triggering a sell-off by
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the great conundrum,'' said Julian Schweitzer, the
World Bank's director for strategy and operations in East Asia.
``That we didn't get it right in Indonesia is obvious, but
understanding how to get it right is difficult. Issues of
governance of a nation have not in the past been part of our
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   In a response to the report, Indonesia's minister of state for
national development planning, Boediono, wrote to the World Bank
that ``we do not accept some of the analysis in the report,''
including its message ``that the World Bank did not push hard
enough for fundamental reform in Indonesia, including the
establishment of a democratic political system, free and open
elections, a free press, respect for human rights and broad-based
participation of the civil society.''
</P>
<P>
   He wrote, ``Open confrontation between the World Bank and the
government of Indonesia would have been very damaging to investor
confidence in Indonesia and would have undermined economic growth,
causing poverty to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   The report's conclusion that the World Bank's success was only
``marginally satisfactory,'' he wrote, is a ``particularly harsh
judgment, and one that reflects an abrupt turnaround from literally
decades of consistently positive assessments.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the greatest accomplishment of the Giuliani
administration is the precipitous drop in the city's crime rate,
its most glaring shortcoming may be the failure to cultivate a
trusting relationship with most of the city's black leaders. Now,
the best and the worst have melded into the Diallo case, presenting
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani again with that most delicate matter of race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Anger persists over last week's shooting death of an unarmed
African immigrant by four white police officers who riddled his
body and apartment-building vestibule with 41 bullets. On Monday,
the president of the NAACP attracted national notice by condemning
the shooting. On Tuesday, more than 1,000 people staged an angry
demonstration in lower Manhattan. Wednesday, the mother of Amadou
Diallo, the victim, heeded the advice of the Rev. Al Sharpton and
curtly rejected any assistance from the mayor while in the city to
retrieve her son's body.
</P>
<P>
   With every passing day, Giuliani struggles to bring a calmer
perspective to the tragedy, to convey convincingly the pain he says
he feels over this loss of life and compassion for the victim's
family. Several times he has imparted heartfelt thoughts, then felt
the need to defensively recite statistics showing that fatal police
shootings are less frequent in New York than in other large cities.
His recitation of statistics seems to linger longer than his words
of sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for the mayor's predicament, including
his decision to reserve most comment during the investigation of
the shooting. But the overriding factor, critics say, is rooted in
the earliest days of Giuliani's tenure: Unlike his predecessors,
the mayor never established a lasting rapport with many of the
city's black leaders, either personally or through emissaries. That
failure, coupled with various slights and arguments along the way,
now leaves him with no capital of trust from which to draw.
</P>
<P>
   This was the clear message at a press conference convened
Wednesday by C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president,
and attended by, among others, former Mayor Ed Koch, who had
troubles of his own with many black political and civic leaders
during his tenure. But rather than score the mayor, most of the
speakers pleaded with him to open the lines of communication.
</P>
<P>
   Being mayor ``requires a willingness to hear,'' Koch said. ``So
we're saying to the mayor: `Listen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fields agreed. ``I certainly am not blaming Mayor Giuliani
or Commissioner Safir for the tragedy that took place,'' she said,
referring to Police Commissioner Howard Safir. Nevertheless, she
said that the city ``must change the tone and move in a different
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani responded Wednesday night by impeaching the event's
credibility, noting that Koch is a persistent critic and saying
that Ms. Fields failed to acknowledge the Police Department's
accomplishments, including reduced crime in black neighborhoods. He
maintained that he has working relationships with other black
leaders _ citing Rep. Charles Rangel and former Rep. Floyd Flake _
and tends not to deal with ``highly partisan Democrats'' who he
said strive for headlines rather than substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hold a press conference and attack me, attack the
police department and completely discredit everything that's been
done, and if you have somebody who is a persistent critic sitting
next to you,'' the mayor said, it suggests ``no real willingness to
work out a real solution. That happens in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the mayor said that he understood ``the frustration. I
can understand the anger. I can understand all of it and I feel
terrible that this happened as I have expressed on numerous
occasions.'' But he said ``that there's a tendency of some people
in our society to blame the police in broad strokes that is just as
vicious a prejudice as any other prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions about Guiliani's relations with
minorities, his aides listed a series of accomplishments _ from
crime reduction to job growth _ that they say have improved the
lives of everyone in the city, and offered a familiar and short
roster of ministers, business owners and neighborhood leaders who
are both black and willing to talk of their admiration for the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But this gambit backfired. One of them, the Rev. Michel
Faulkner, said Wednesday that he met with Giuliani this week to
convey the emotion that the Diallo case has sparked in black
neighborhoods, and to suggest that the administration more
emphatically display empathy for communities jarred by the
shooting. But Faulkner said he left that meeting feeling
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of where we go from here, I really would hope the
mayor would understand the amount of tremendous pain that
communities of color are in over this incident,'' Faulkner said.
``If he does not, I really think this will be a permanent blight on
his administration.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment he took office in 1994, Giuliani's relationship
with various black leaders has been complicated, even
dysfunctional. A Republican, he saw many of them as cogs in a
Democratic machine that had brought city government to a
standstill; he saw no need to curry their favor. He famously
refused to meet with Sharpton, whom he saw as divisive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the mayor's first actions was to end the practice that
his predecessors had of having liaisons to the many constituencies
in the city, from gays and lesbians to Hispanics and blacks. ``He
didn't want to Balkanize the city,'' said his press secretary,
Colleen Roche.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. David Paterson and City Councilman Bill Perkins,
among other black Democrats, have contended that the decision in
fact Balkanized neighborhoods like Harlem, leaving them with no
access to the administration.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the tension is the Police Department, whose
members have given the mayor something to brag about _ crime
reduction _ even as they resent him for blocking their requests for
pay increases. There is the perception that the department's
get-tough policy has been largely directed at young black men.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the very ones who are being singled out are the ones who
are being saved'' by the crackdown on crime, said Kenneth T.
Jackson, a professor of history at Columbia University. ``If you
look at just who's alive and who's dead, it's saving the lives of
black men. The people who were getting killed were never white
women or old white guys or even black women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very complicated issue,'' he added. ``It's a terrible
situation when people fear government.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Symbolizing that fear of government was the Louima case of 1997,
in which a Haitian immigrant was brutalized inside a Brooklyn
police precinct. Giuliani immediately called for a task force to
explore community-police relations. But months after his
re-election, he ridiculed some of that task force's recommendations
with sarcasm that overshadowed that fact that he had set aside $15
million for sensitivity training for officers.
</P>
<P>
   That sarcasm, along with memories of the administration's
aggressive handling of the Million Youth March in Harlem last
summer, returned to haunt Giuliani when Diallo was killed in a
fusillade of police bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's challenge, according to Dr. James Forbes, pastor of
Riverside Church in Harlem, is to better convey a universal
message: ``Guess what. You all count.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Julia Sweeney's acclaimed, one-woman stage show
``God Said, `Ha!' '' has now been preserved on film. It's a good
show, but barely a movie.
</P>
<P>
   For those unfamiliar with the piece, the former ``Saturday Night
Live'' comic built a monologue out of one very bad year in her
life. Freshly and amicably divorced and retired from the TV
program, she'd moved to L.A., found a perfect little house that she
furnished just so, and was all set to indulge a life of cozy
independence when her brother was diagnosed with terminal cancer.
</P>
<P>
   She took him in. Her parents from Washington state wanted to
help out. They moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney found herself reduced to sneaking cigarettes in the car
and making out with her boyfriend in the hall, hoping not to get
caught but kind of turned on by the prospect. Hilarious
descriptions of this premature second childhood are balanced by
loving and harrowing recollections of her brother's inspiring,
inevitably losing struggle.
</P>
<P>
   And then comes the day when Julia gets her own call from the
oncologist ...
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who's otherwise best known for creating such ``SNL''
characters as the sexually ambiguous Pat, is an engaging raconteur
with a nice way of imitating people while still remaining Julia.
She doesn't do characters here; rather, she makes it clear that
she's giving you her take on somebody. It's a nice way to prevent
sharp or even angry observations from degenerating into cheap
disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the person we learn the most about is Julia. And even
though what she reveals is unavoidably selective, the piece could
not work as well as it does without a great degree of self-honesty;
indeed, there would be no other reason for it to exist.
</P>
<P>
   The film was shot on a soundstage designed to look like the
stage of a small theater, dressed to resemble Sweeney's living
room. There are a few pieces of furniture, a lamp. Four cameras
were employe$X}y

   BEIJING _ Ever since Chinese officials this week started
publicly criticizing a groundbreaking decision by Hong Kong's
highest court, a new sense of tension and uncertainty has crept
into the relationship between China and Hong Kong, the former
British colony that was reunited with the mainland 19 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, handed down by a unanimous Court of Final Appeals on
Jan. 29, says that four children born in mainland China to parents
who are Hong Kong residents have the right to live in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court decision is a mistake and against the Basic Law,''
Zhao Qizheng, the information minister for China's cabinet, told
reporters who gathered on Monday for a party for the Chinese New
Year. ``This is a very serious matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the case's details involved immigration policy, the
judges seized the opportunity to make broader statements about the
independence of Hong Kong's judiciary and about Hong Kong autonomy
in general.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time Hong Kong officials have so openly clashed
with mainland authorities over gray areas in the Hong Kong Basic
Law, which both sides had agreed would serve as the legal
foundation for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region when it
reverted to China from Britain on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And, after the charges and the countercharges of the last two
days, it is clear that there are major differences of opinion about
the meaning of ``one country, two systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The case that sparked the debate was simple enough, concerning
the status of tens of thousands _ if not hundreds of thousands _ of
mainland Chinese with parents who are legal Hong Kong residents.
The ruling opens the way to admission of people to Hong Kong if at
least one of their parents is a resident _ even if the children
were born before their parents lived in Hong Kong and even if they
are now adults.
</P>
<P>
   The justices set an important precedent and sailed headlong into
uncharted and treacherous waters. They said that Hong Kong's Basic
Law, not the laws or policies of the mainland, should decide the
matter and that Hong Kong courts have full authority to interpret
the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people in Hong Kong believe there was clear intent among
the judges to set out a landmark case,'' said Wang Chenguang, an
associate professor of law at the City University of Hong Kong, who
was formerly at Beijing University. ``It reflects a desire to use
this formal document to reinforce and assert the autonomy of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and also the independence
of the Hong Kong judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by Zhao, the Chinese official, set off a round of
dire predictions and paroxysms of dread among politicians, scholars
and diplomats in Hong Kong, who have long feared that Beijing would
try to force its values on their turf. Thus far, Hong Kong remains
a freewheeling place whose newspapers are quick to pick up hints of
mainland scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any move to restrict the independent judicial power of the
Court of Final Appeal would be a matter of serious concern to us,''
the British Consulate General in Hong Kong said in a statement on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear what, if anything, the Chinese government
plans to do about the situation. Many Hong Kong legal scholars said
the decision by the Final Court of Appeals is just that _ final.
And China's leaders are savvy enough to know that any direct
interference with Hong Kong's judiciary would cause foreign
investors to flee from this slumping but still vibrant metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   The central legal issue is how to interpret two somewhat
contradictory clauses in the Basic Law. Article 22 of Chapter 2,
which deals with relations between Hong Kong and the mainland, says
that Chinese residents wishing to go to Hong Kong must first gain
the permission of China's authorities.
</P>
<P>
   But Article 24 of Chapter 3 _ dealing with Hong Kong citizens'
rights _ says that children of Hong Kong citizens who are born
outside of Hong Kong will enjoy the rights of citizens. ``According
to this,'' said one legal scholar, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, ``these kids have an inalienable right of abode and
don't need a permit.''
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling, the judges put Article 24 above Article 22,
effectively proclaiming that mainland rules that interfere with the
constitutionally protected rights of Hong Kong citizens are
invalid, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   In narrow terms, that decision means that Hong Kong will now
accept children of residents whether or not they have the blessing
of the mainland authorities to leave and giving thousands of
mainland immigrants already in Hong Kong illegally a potential
legal mechanism for staying. But to many liberals in Hong Kong, the
significance of the decision is much broader.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court asserted in this way both the self-government of
Hong Kong and the necessity of rights and the rule of law,'' wrote
Yash Ghai, a law professor the University of Hong Kong, in The
South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
   China has yet to explain its objections fully, and Zhao said the
government would present its formal opinion at ``an appropriate
time.'' At a previously scheduled Foreign Ministry briefing on
Tuesday, a spokesman said only that the central government was
``concerned'' about the issue, adding that the opinion of mainland
legal scholars ``is worthy of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, the state-controlled news agency featured
interviews with four legal scholars who helped draft the Basic Law.
They attacked the court decision, contending that the Hong Kong
court could not disregard Chinese legislation and that its
jurisdiction is limited.
</P>
<P>
   Wu Jianfan of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said the
authority to interpret the law ``rests with the National People's
Congress Standing Committee.'' Some mainland scholars contend that
the Chinese Congress should have been called upon to clarify any
contradiction in the Hong Kong Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities have also said they are worried about a
possible large-scale influx of immigrants into Hong Kong at a time
unemployment is rising. For the same reason, the court's decision
provoked criticism from both many Hong Kong residents and the Hong
Kong government.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the government decision may not be fully enforceable
anyway. The court instructed the Hong Kong government to meet with
mainland authorities to devise a new system to process immigrants.
But mainland officials may be less than eager to cooperate.

U.S. BORDER POLICY WITH MEXICO DRAWS COMPLAINT FROM RIGHTS GROUPS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)  (rk) 
 By   SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ An international human rights complaint filed
Wednesday asserts that U.S. border policies have brought about
hundreds of deaths of illegal immigrants who cross the border in
the desert mountains of California, where they freeze or die of
thirst.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint argues that newly erected fences as well as more
vigorous enforcement by the border patrol have led illegal
immigrants to take dangerous routes through treacherous mountain
passes and sizzling deserts, away from border cities.
</P>
<P>
   A result has been a surge in immigrants' deaths, the complaint
says. Mexican diplomats have documented the deaths of 360
immigrants along the California border since 1994, when the United
States started a crackdown, says the complaint by the American
Civil Liberties Union and other U.S. and Mexican rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has abused its right to guard its borders
with a strategy that puts migrants in mortal danger by forcing them
into mountains and deserts,'' Claudia Smith, a lawyer with
California Rural Legal Assistance, a co-signer of the complaint,
said in a news session here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint was lodged in Washington before the Organization
of American States, which will seek a response from the United
States and issue recommendations this year. OAS rights
recommendations are nonbinding, but carry moral weight.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. border tactics adopted since 1994 have aimed to prevent
illegal immigrants from crossing the frontier near cities like San
Diego, where they have annoyed suburban Americans by running
through backyards and hiding from border agents in shopping
centers.

 WASHINGTON: OK, too.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Senators said those speeches were orderly, and the tone inside
the chamber was serious, even grave at times. Party warfare seemed
to abate. ``The sharp partisan divisions that are evident in open
debate are not nearly as evident behind closed doors,'' said Sen.
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., one of his party's fiercest partisans.
</P>
<P>
   Among those speaking on Wednesday were Sens. James Inhofe of
Oklahoma, Conrad Burns of Montana, Jim Bunning of Kentucky and
Richard Shelby of Alabama, all Republicans; and Sens. Patrick Leahy
of Vermont, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, John Breaux of
Louisiana, and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, all Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But they did not confine their comments to the closed chamber.
Just hours after Lott implored senators on Wednesday morning to
honor their oath of secrecy and not make floor statements public
before the final votes, Harkin left the chamber to read to
reporters the remarks he planned to make later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing, as expected, that he would oppose both articles,
Harkin blasted the House prosecutors. ``Where the political
motivation is so blatant, as it has been in this case, I think we
in the Senate should have our guard up on what this case is
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Angered by what he viewed as Harkin's grandstanding and breaking
Senate rules on publicizing floor remarks, Lott rushed to
microphones off the Senate floor to criticize Harkin's comments as
``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkin's aides said the senator, a fierce critic of the closed
deliberations, had not violated Senate ethics rules. They cited a
memorandum from Lott's staff that said it was permissible for
senators to read their statements in public before delivering them
in closed session.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, a growing number of senators paraded before
the cameras or released statements altered slightly from the
comments they intended to give in the closed session.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, who handed out a 27-page statement, said the House
prosecutors were unfairly handicapped by the Senate's refusal to
hear testimony from any live witnesses. As a result, Specter,
citing Scottish law, said he will cast a vote of ``Not proven,''
instead of guilty, not guilty or present.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Harkin, virtually all of the Senate Democrats who issued
statements on Wednesday criticized what they said was the
overzealous and politically motivated crusades by Starr and the
House prosecutors, who based their case on Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``They repeatedly rely on inferences while ignoring direct
testimony to the contrary,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. ``They
omit key materials which contradict their charges. And they contain
serious misstatements of key facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even mild-mannered Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, perhaps the most
anonymous member of the Senate, lashed out at the House, saying,
``The partisan nature of the House action invites challenges to its
legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators who say they will vote to convict Clinton on both
counts were less vocal on Wednesday. Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana,
a moderate Republican whose comments are usually measured, was
uncharacteristically acid in his assessment of the president: ``The
crimes committed here demonstrate that he is capable of lying
routinely whenever it is convenient. He is not trustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   As the impeachment deliberations meandered on behind closed
doors, supporters of rebuking Clinton virtually conceded that
Republican opposition, including a threatened filibuster, had
doomed their efforts to bring such a measure to the Senate floor
for a vote before a holiday recess begins this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure is on life support, gasping for breath,'' said Sen.
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who favors that action.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Democrats would push for a
test vote on a draft censure after the final impeachment votes. If
that motion fails to win the necessary 67 votes, she said she might
draft a statement condemning the president's behavior and circulate
it for senators to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has gone up and down,'' said Feinstein. ``We will
get enough signatures and sponsors to show that this is a serious
document. One way or another, this is going to see the light of
day.''
</P>
<P>
   White House aides are debating whether and how Clinton should
react to the Senate votes, once they are taken. They are
considering several options, from a brief written statement to an
Oval Office address.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides are particularly concerned about the tone that
he would take in a statement, since many senators have warned that
they would take a dim view of any gloating. No matter what the
president says, some aides said, he will be criticized as
celebrating the outcome of this 13-month ordeal.

JOHN LAMBERT COTTER, ARCHEOLOGIST, DIES AT 87  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to restore 7th graf, `His work took him...')   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. John Lambert Cotter, an archeologist who dug into America's
ancient and not-so-ancient past, died on Friday at a retirement
residence in Philadelphia. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Cotter retired as curator emeritus from the University of
Pennsylvania Museum of Archeology and Anthropology but kept an
office and regular working hours there until last month.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1930s he headed a team from the Academy of Natural
Sciences in Philadelphia that dug up weapons and tools used 11,000
years ago by the earliest humans known to have been in North
America, Paleo-Amerindians, at a site in New Mexico. More recently
he explored the origins of Philadelphia and Jamestown, Va., the
first permanent English settlement in America.
</P>
<P>
   Cotter wrote ``Archaeological Excavations at Jamestown
Virginia'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, revised, 1994) and
was co-author of ``The Buried Past: An Archaeological History of
Philadelphia'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 1992) and
``Walnut Street Prison Workshop'' (Athenaeum, 1988). All three
remain in print.
</P>
<P>
   He contributed more than 200 articles and reviews to
professional journals, beginning in 1937. Among his many honors was
the 1978 David E. Finley Award for Outstanding Achievement from the
National Trust for Historic Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Cotter, who was born in Denver, graduated in anthropology from
the University of Denver in 1934. He received a master's degree in
anthropology there in 1935 and a doctorate in the same discipline
at the University of Pennsylvania in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   His work took him to sites in Canada, Mexico, Peru, the Middle
East, Greece, Italy and Britain. Cotter joined the National Park
Service in 1940 as the archeologist in charge of a prehistoric
pueblo preserved as a national monument in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   He spent 37 years with the agency, the last four as head
archeologist of the Colonial National Historic Park at Jamestown.
He joined the Penn faculty in 1960, initially as an adjunct
professor, having been sent to Philadelphia to plan and start
archeological projects at Independence National Historical Park.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the university's department of American
civilization, he taught that subject and introduced a novel course
in American historical archeology. He was curator for American
historical archeology at the Museum of Archeology and Anthropology
from 1971 to 1980, when he took emeritus status.
</P>
<P>
   Cotter is survived by his wife of 58 years, Virginia Tomlin
Cotter; a son, Laurence T., of Albuquerque, N.M.; a daughter, Jean
C. Spaans of Montgomery Village, Md., and three grandsons.

CENSUS DIRECTOR ACCUSES HOUSE REPUBLICANS OF MEDDLING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., MD.)   (nk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The director of the Census Bureau criticized
congressional Republicans on Wednesday for what he described as
their efforts to ``micromanage'' preparations for the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Kenneth Prewitt, said in an interview that
Republicans on the House Subcommittee on the Census had suggested
changes in bureau plans like how many census takers should be
hired, where they should be deployed, the language other than
English in which census forms should be printed for a given area,
and the ability of municipal governments to challenge the count of
local populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put all these together, it's as if the subcommittee is
trying to design the census,'' said Prewitt, whom the Senate
confirmed to his post last summer. ``It strikes me as a very risky
enterprise to try to micromanage the census.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the career professionals in the Census Bureau's
headquarters in Suitland, Md., outside Washington, have long held
views like Prewitt's, but they have generally grumbled in private.
The director's comments stand out not so much because of their tone
or content as because he chose to make them publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said he was particularly bothered by a bill introduced
by Rep. Dan Miller of Florida, chairman of the House Subcommittee
on the Census, that would permit local governments to review the
Census Bureau's work after completion of the count. If a
municipality challenged the bureau's count of a given block, for
instance, the agency would have to send census takers to recanvass
the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It invites 39,000 independent jurisdictions to tell us that
they have more people than we found,'' Prewitt said. ``It's an
incentive for anyone to try to boost their numbers for either
economic or political gain.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure, known as Post Census Local Review, was used for
the 1990 census, and challenges then forced the bureau to revisit
20 percent of the nation's census blocks. Prewitt and other
officials of the bureau said that it had proved expensive and had
found only a tiny fraction of those who had earlier been missed and
that as a result, the agency had made no plans to use it in the
2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller said: ``This is something that local officials want.
I don't see why the Census Bureau would object. I don't know what
they are afraid of. Are they afraid local officials will find a
mistake, or do they think they are perfect?''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled subcommittee is holding a hearing on
the bill on Thursday and has scheduled a vote then. Prewitt said he
was particularly upset that no Census Bureau official had been
invited to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel almost aggrieved,'' he said, ``that the subcommittee
would hold hearings on something that would lead to such a major
change in census procedures without inviting the Census Bureau to
testify.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that discussions about the bill had taken place ``at
the staff level'' and that the bureau's objections had been noted.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats maintain that the Republicans are pressing for Post
Census Local Review to throw a monkey wrench into the Census
Bureau's ability to produce population counts that can be used for
the drawing of boundaries for congressional and state legislative
districts. Bureau officials say Post Census Local Review would add
five to six weeks to the time to compile official numbers for such
redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Supreme Court ruled that the Census Bureau could
not use a hotly debated method known as statistical sampling to
help produce an official population figure that will be used to
determine the number of House seats each state will be allocated.
</P>
<P>
   But the High Court did not explicitly rule on whether sampling
is permitted to establish precisely where inside a state people
live. Such information is used to draw boundaries for congressional
and state legislative districts.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that sampling will increase the number of members of
minorities that are counted. Since minorities tend to live in areas
that are strongly Democratic, increasing their numbers could help
Democrats when district lines are drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Most states must have official numbers for redistricting by
April 1, 2001. If they do not get the number affected by sampling
by then, they will have to use the basic figures the Census Bureau
prepares for apportionment.

SENATE WILL WEIGH FUTURE OF THE LAW COVERING COUNSELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The independent counsel law, which for two decades
has been the foundation for investigations involving deep
constitutional issues as well as venality and sexual misbehavior,
will be debated in Senate hearings beginning on Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings before the Governmental Affairs Committee, headed
by Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., are sure to be heated. The law,
enacted in 1978 after the Watergate scandal, has been controversial
from the start. It has been re-enacted several times and will
expire on June 30 unless Congress reauthorizes it.
</P>
<P>
   The law's supporters argue that it enables outside investigators
to delve into possible wrongdoing by the president, vice president
and other high government officials without fear of retribution.
Its detractors contend that some investigators have gone on fishing
expeditions, trampling on individual rights and spending millions
of dollars, often with little to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson and the committee's ranking Democrat, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman of Connecticut, said the panel would hear the views of
former attorneys general, legal scholars, subjects of previous
investigations and independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   The committee announced on Wednesday that witnesses for the
opening hearing would include Howard H. Baker Jr., the former
Republican senator from Tennessee who was vice chairman of the
Senate Watergate Committee, and Griffin B. Bell, who was attorney
general from 1977 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Bell served on an independent bipartisan commission,
established by the University of Virginia, that issued a report in
December concluding that the independent counsel law does not work
properly. Among its shortcomings, the commission said, is that the
law does not provide subjects of investigations with ``the
safeguards afforded to all other subjects of federal criminal
investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, some 20 independent counsels have been appointed
to investigate possible transgressions, ranging from the sale of
weapons to Iran and the diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels
to President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.

BIGGEST DISPUTES AT KOSOVO PEACE TALKS ARE AMONG THE HOSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Great Britain)  (See also KOSOVO-U.S.) 
(mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMBOUILLET, France _ So far, the arguments in the early days of
the Kosovo peace conference have not been among the Serbian and
ethnic Albanian delegates, who are being kept busy by the
negotiators on subjects like a new constitution and elections.
</P>
<P>
   The more tricky divisions have been among the hosts _ the United
States, four European nations and Russia _ as they have tried to
resolve their differences on vital issues like disarming the two
sides and deploying a peacekeeping mission in the event of a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important documents of the conference, a paper
known as the military annex, was sent to NATO Wednesday night,
officials said, after last-minute debates on how the United Nations
should bless it and how quickly the two sides in the conflict
should be expected to demobilize.
</P>
<P>
   The military aspect is critical because in the end the outcome
of the peace effort here is likely to come down to one major
factor: Will the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, accept
foreign troops on Serbian soil and allow them to turn Kosovo into a
quasi-protectorate?
</P>
<P>
   A string of statements from Belgrade in the last two days has
indicated that the government is rejecting the idea.
</P>
<P>
   To better gauge the temperature of the peace effort, Milosevic,
who has remained in Belgrade, is sending the prime minister of
Serbia, Milan Milutinovic, to the talks on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Before the prime minister's arrival, the United States and the
Europeans settled their differences on some of the military
questions.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, French officials said the deployment of
NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo needed to be backed by a U.N. Security
Council resolution, a proposition the Clinton administration
opposed. Washington, according to State Department officials, was
sticking to its stand that NATO should be able to act independently
of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The debate played out in Paris, Rambouillet, London and
Washington with a compromise worked out Wednesday afternoon by the
British. Instead of the United Nations being asked to ``authorize''
the deployment, the Security Council will be asked to ``endorse''
it, a British diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, all sides could claim victory. For the French, the
United Nations still got a nod. For the Americans, the ``neuralgic
word `authorize''' was avoided, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior French official described Wednesday why the U.N.
involvement was so important .
</P>
<P>
   ``When NATO is out of an area, the question is can NATO act on
its own?'' he said, referring to the fact that NATO would be
deploying troops beyond the territory of the 16 member nations in a
mission not intended to defend those members. The official said the
French position was that a Security Council resolution was needed
when NATO deployed troops outside alliance territory.
</P>
<P>
   A more practical debate that affects the two sides in the
conflict on the ground in Kosovo was over how quickly the Kosovo
Liberation Army, the guerrilla group of ethnic Albanians who have
been fighting Serbian forces, should be required to demobilize. So
far, the guerrillas have not been formally asked whether they will
disband. Five of the 16 ethnic Albanian delegates at the conference
here are members of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   There seemed to be some doubt about whether the insurgents would
accept such a deal, but Western officials said they were pressing
ahead with plans for the Kosovo Liberation Army to give up its
arms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An official familiar with the thinking of the guerrillas said,
``They know they have to be reconstituted, the question is how.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Western diplomat involved in drafting the demobilization
plans said the guerrillas would be required to give up their heavy
weapons by a certain time and that there would be a prohibition on
carrying light weapons.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of Washington, the diplomat said, some
adjustments were made in the military annex that would allow the
Kosovo Liberation Army to demobilize a little more slowly than was
originally envisioned. Because the Serbian forces and the Yugoslav
army would be allowed to keep a permanent, though minimized,
presence in Kosovo, the guerrillas were being offered the
concession of slower demobilization, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian security police, who according to NATO military
planners now number 11,000 in Kosovo, would be required to reduce
their forces to 2,500 over three to six months, the diplomat said.
The Yugoslav army, which now has about 15,000 soldiers in Kosovo,
is being called on to reduce its forces to 1,500 for border patrols
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The insurgents' overriding concern, according to participants in
the talks, has been their security and the security of the ethnic
Albanian population, which last summer and fall was attacked in
villages with scorched-earth tactics by the Serbs.

EXASPERATED IMPEACHMENT SPECTATOR FREE, AWAITING HIS OWN TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARIA RECIO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A week after a spectator disrupted the Senate
impeachment trial by crying out, ``God almighty, take the vote and
get it over with,'' senators are preparing to do exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the man who voiced the sentiments of many Americans?
</P>
<P>
   Arrested, arraigned and now free awaiting trial, Richard Douglas
Llamas was released on his own recognizance a day after the Feb. 4
incident with orders not to come within a block of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Llamas, 48, an unemployed carpenter, was charged with
``disruption of Congress,'' a misdemeanor. He faces up to six
months in jail and a maximum fine of $500 if found guilty. His
trial is set for April 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great interest in the Senate trial,'' said Llamas'
court-appointed attorney, Michael Madden. ``He does have a healthy
interest in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The outburst, however, amounts to ``unlawful conduct inside the
Capitol,'' and must be prosecuted, said Channing Phillips,
spokesman for the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Llamas generated a brief burst of publicity because of his
outburst. Madden said his client was treated as a celebrity in the
cell block where he was held for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the marshals came back and shook his hand and said, `It
was an honorable thing that you did' and offered to buy him
dinner,'' the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Llamas has not wanted to comment since the incident. Madden said
the limited information he has about his client says that he is
from Northern California and served in the Navy during the Vietnam
War.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he has an ax to grind with the government,'' the
attorney said.

   PILOTS FOR AMERICAN AIRLINES ARE ORDERED BACK TO WORK
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ordered American Airlines pilots to return to
work, ending five days of labor unrest that grounded more than
2,500 flights and inconvenienced tens of thousands of passengers.
American said that it expected most of the pilots to return to work
and that service should be back to normal by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The order came after American, the country's second-largest
carrier, was forced to cancel 40 percent, or 906 of its 2,250 daily
flights yesterday, the worst day since hundreds of pilots began
calling in sick on Saturday as a result of a dispute over
American's recent purchase of Reno Air.
</P>
<P>
   The 300 pilots for Reno Air support the American Airlines pilots
in their labor dispute, but they have their own problem. They do
not want to be put on the bottom of the seniority list of
American's more than 9,000 pilots as if they were all hired on Dec.
23, the day the merger took effect.
</P>

travelers can still expect inconvenience and disruption during this
coming long weekend.

 &HT;    Lack of TV interest, corporate support KO fight series at Roxy
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Evander Holyfield drew more than 40,000 fans for
a heavyweight title defense at the Georgia Dome in September, it
was reasonable to assume that the pro boxing scene in Atlanta would
experience some growth. Instead, it has suffered a significant
passing.
</P>
<P>
   After staging eight monthly fight cards at the Roxy Theater in
1998, Michael Morrison has decided not to bring the shows back this
year. The original plan was to have the first in a series of cards
this month, but a lack of local television interest and poor
corporate support led Morrison to shelve the series. It averaged
$20,000 to stage each show, he said, and he broke even on only a
few, losing an average of $5,000 per show on the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our last show was in October, so we had four months to sell
out our next show,'' Morrison said. ``But we had only sold 30 of
the 45 tables (at $400 to $500 each). Television was really the
main thing, though. Without TV, we couldn't get the caliber of
fighters we wanted. People get tired of seeing the bum-of-the-month
club after a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Mishou, executive director of the Georgia Boxing Commission,
said the end of the Roxy shows shouldn't be viewed as anything
tragic. Morrison said he would promote one or two higher-level
shows during the year if he can get the corporate support, and the
Buckhead shows sparked interest from other local and national
promoters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like there to be monthly shows, but this doesn't hurt us
or help us,'' Mishou said. ``What Michael did, in essence, was
introduce boxing back to Atlanta. It had been several years since
smaller-venue shows had been done on a regular basis. Does this
hurt? Yeah. Is it devastating? He opened the door, and he's
leaving, but he's not closing the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Fight cards are scheduled Friday at the Center Stage Theater in
Midtown and March 3 at the World Congress Center. Promoter Don King
has staged some shows in the area and says he might do some on a
regular basis beginning in April.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison also is planning to move the Biggs-Morrison gym, which
he co-operates with trainer Xavier Biggs. Morrison said he hopes to
have a deal completed in the next 90 days to move the gym from its
location off Linden and Peachtree to a warehouse district off
Northside, two miles west of Peachtree. The current facility is
hampered by minimal parking.

Management Area in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-acre Albany Nursery Wildlife Management Area, located in
Dougherty County, was suggested for sale last year by WRD as part
of its 2000 budget proposal now being considered by the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we regret that some hunters will lose the opportunity to
hunt at Albany Nursery, we believe that the proposal to sell this
area is a sound business decision and is in the best interest of
the state's sportsmen and women,'' WRD director David Waller said.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly will make the final decision whether to
sell the Albany Nursery during deliberations on the state's 2000
budget, probably sometime in March.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the budget process initiated by Miller, state
agencies must develop options for cutting their budgets or
generating additional revenue. The DNR proposed selling the small
tract, valued at $1.2 million, to generate funds instead of closing
other, larger wildlife management areas or fish hatcheries.
</P>
<P>
   Big-game hunts on the WMA are available only to people with
physical disabilities, yet it is so small that only 26 disabled
hunters were allowed to hunt deer and wild turkey during the
1998-99 season. There are limited small-game hunting opportunities
for other visitors. If the General Assembly approves the sale, WRD
will retain a portion of the funds to buy replacement land that
would provide facilities and hunting opportunities for physically
challenged hunters.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY TIME
</P>
<P>
   Those attending the free seminars at this weekend's Turkeyrama
can cut the learning curve on hunting wild turkey in Georgia by
years. Not only will the best hunters and callers be on the podium
at the Georgia Wildlife Federation-sponsored show at the Perry
Agrirama Friday through Sunday, some pretty good ones will be at
the show's many exhibits both as exhibitors and visitors. The show
features the cutting edge of turkey hunting, with shotguns,
accessories, calls and information. Tickets are $6 for adults and
$3 for seniors and children 6-12.
</P>
<P>
   GET BETTER `SARGE'
</P>
<P>
   Bob Shumaker, better known as ``Sarge'' to customers at the Fish
Hawk in Buckhead, is recovering from quadruple bypass heart surgery
at Emory University Hospital. Shumaker, 56, a retired Marine
gunnery sergeant, experienced chest pains while quail hunting
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   At work on Monday, he continued to feel _ and look _ bad, so
Phyllis Merriman, mother of Fish Hawk proprietor Gary Merriman,
took charge and called Emory cardiologist Dr. Steve Clements, a
longtime customer. Shumaker met Clements at the emergency room, and
surgery was deemed necessary. Dr. Joe Craver, the surgeon, used a
new technique on Shumaker, using one vein from his leg and a radial
artery, rather than the usual pair of leg veins.

PASSIONS OF VIETNAM WAR REVIVED IN LITTLE SAIGON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (jw) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTMINSTER, Calif. _ The passions, protests and restless ghosts
of the Vietnam War came back to life Wednesday in a normally sleepy
Orange County strip mall here, because a Vietnamese immigrant put
up a poster of Ho Chi Minh in his electronics store and dared his
fellow immigrants to take it down.
</P>
<P>
   Those passions boiled over when the owner, Truong Van Tran, was
knocked to the ground by an angry crowd that confronted him outside
his store after a judge affirmed his right to display the poster.
</P>
<P>
   The judge first had ordered him to take down the poster last
month when demonstrators besieged his shop for five days. But
Wednesday afternoon, as he returned to his shop to put it back up,
his car was surrounded by protesters chanting ``down with
communism'' and ``go back to Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Tran, 37, got out of his car and was confronted by a man who
thrust a burning cigarette within an inch of his nose. Then another
protester slapped Tran in the face with a hand covered with spit.
</P>
<P>
   Tran fell to the pavement as his wife and two small children
watched from a locked car. As Tran lay on the pavement, another man
in the crowd draped the yellow, red-striped flag of South Vietnam
over Tran and shouted, ``Down with communism.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman in the crowd shouted, ``I hope you die.''
</P>
<P>
   The police arrived about five minutes later and Tran was taken
to a hospital by ambulance, complaining of chest pains.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Bill Lewis of the Westminster Police Department said police
had asked Tran repeatedly to tell them if he was going to return to
the shop so they could protect him. ``But he just showed up,''
Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began last month when Tran refused to take down the
poster and a Vietnamese flag from his shop. The strip mall is in an
area known as Little Saigon, which is home to about 300,000
Vietnamese immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   For five days last month, as many as 400 immigrants rallied in
front of Tran's small store, chanting ``No to communism'' and
demanding that the display be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Tran refused, saying that the First Amendment of his new country
gave him the right to put up any poster or flag he wanted. The
tension and the passions grew hotter.
</P>
<P>
   One day, as Tran left the store, Hi-Tek, someone struck him in
the back of the head and he fell to the sidewalk. He was treated at
a hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
   The mall's landlord took Tran to court to remove the display,
contending that he was violating his lease by creating a public
nuisance. The protest, the landlord said, was disrupting the other
businesses in the mall, which is dominated by the signs and sounds
of Vietnam, from food to videos to travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Barbara Tam Nomoto Schumann of Orange County Superior
Court issued a preliminary injunction last month ordering Tran to
remove the display.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, as more than 200 Vietnamese immigrants lined the
courthouse hallway, many wearing stickers reading ``No Vietnam
communist,'' the judge dissolved her order. Though the ``display is
undisputedly offensive,'' she said, the poster and flag are symbols
of free speech, ``accorded the highest degree of First Amendment
protection.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then a team of beefy court officers escorted Tran and his family
away through a back door. ``It's a ringing victory for free
speech,'' said one of Tran's lawyers, Peter Eliasberg of the
American Civil Liberties Union.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a right to hang whatever picture I like in my store,''
Tran said in an interview Wednesday. ``I know the law in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Tran, who came to the United States in 1980, said he developed
an appreciation for the former North Vietnamese president after
visiting Ho Chi Minh City in November.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer representing the protesters, Stuart Parker, said
Tran's display was not protected because the flag and the poster
were ``fighting words'' for a people still haunted by the memories
of a country many of them fled when the war ended in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a victory for free speech,'' Parker said.
``I see it as a victory for inflaming free speech. It's a gray
line.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Parker said many Vietnamese immigrants believed Tran was paid by
the communists to provoke his countrymen. Tran has denied being a
communist and the protesters at the courthouse Wednesday admitted
that they had no proof that he was. But whether he is or he is not,
does not matter when it comes to his freedom of speech, said Ronald
Talmo, another lawyer for Tran.
</P>
<P>
   Talmo said Tran was not trying to provoke but to communicate
with his fellow immigrants, to help heal his and their wounds and
hearts. Tran's motivation, Talmo said, ``is the more exposure Ho
Chi Minh and the Vietnamese flag have, the greater the chance of
dialogue between the competing factions and the better the chance
for understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Understanding has sometimes been hard to come by in Little
Saigon. The area is rabidly anti-communist and during the 1980s
protests occasionally turned to violence and arson. Even those who
dared speak in support normalized relations between the United
States and Vietnam could be branded communists. But in recent
years, the passions had cooled considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Tran said his poster and flag had been up for months. For the
most part, Talmo said, no one seemed to care. But a couple of
months ago, someone complained to his nephew who was working in the
store and Tran fired off a fax to an anti-communist group of
Vietnamese immigrants, challenging them ``to come over and clear me
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Tran said he thought they would come to talk to him. Instead, he
said, they came ``to hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the protesters, he said, go to temple every day. ``What
does Buddha say?'' Tran asked. ``He says forgive.''

 &HT;    Beating Germany a boost
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was almost a year ago to the day since the U.S.
stunned Brazil that the Americans vanquished another formidable foe
in a 3-0 rout of Germany in Jacksonville on Saturday. But unlike
the Brazilian match, which came right before the World Cup, this
one wasn't followed by grand pronouncements that the U.S. is on the
verge of becoming a world power.
</P>
<P>
   New U.S. coach Bruce Arena got his first win in dominating
fashion against the ailing Germans, and while he's not jumping on a
bandwagon, he also was eager to pat his club on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critics might say that the Germans didn't field a full
team, but neither did we,'' Arena said. ``In that game, we were
pretty good. It didn't matter who was in a German uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Three German-based players _ midfielders Jovan Kirovski and
Claudia Reyna and Hertha Berlin-bound MLS product Tony Sanneh _
scored as the U.S. displayed surprising offensive potency, getting
all three goals in the first 26 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team, which plays Chile on Feb. 21 in Fort Lauderdale,
will probably have some different faces in camp. The German winter
break is ending, and Arena is continuing his policy of looking at
as many untested prospects as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a feeling coming out of the World Cup that American
soccer had hit rock bottom again,'' he said. ``I never thought that
was the case. The results are not totally surprising. I think it's
an indication that we're heading in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   WORLD CUP DRAW SUNDAY
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women have known for months when and where they will be
playing in the World Cup this summer. On Sunday, they'll find out
their first-round opponents when the draw and the first FIFA
Women's All-Star game take place in San Jose (8 p.m. ESPN2).
</P>
<P>
   The draw is during halftime of the game pitting the U.S. team
against a side of international stars. The United States will open
on June 20 at Giants Stadium and then will play at Soldier Field on
June 24 before completing round-robin play June 27 in Foxboro,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The draw will place the 16 teams in four groups of four teams.
The other seeded teams are defending champion Norway, China and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   SILVERBACKS DRAFT THREE
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Silverbacks, looking for goalkeeping help, selected
Furman University's Ronnie Pascale in the A-League draft Sunday.
They also chose two local college standout forwards, Andy Leech of
Life University and Emory's Ahmed Mohyeldin. The team begins
training camp next month.
</P>
<P>
   NIKE DROPS ITALY
</P>
<P>
   As part of a range of cost-cutting moves, Nike has discontinued
its $15 million shoe and apparel sponsorship of the Italian
national team. Don't look for Nike to scale back its eight-year,
$200 million deal with Brazil, however, not with the global appeal
of the club and star player Ronaldo, whose Inter Milan club
recently joined the Nike stable. ... With perennial Italian Serie A
power Juventus stuck in ninth place, coach Marcelo Lippi resigned
abruptly Monday and was replaced by Carlo Ancelotti.

 &HT;    Racing change at top
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ NASCAR got its start on the beach here in
February 1948, and for the past 50 seasons a member of the France
family has held the torch as stock-car racing evolved into
America's fastest-growing spectator sport.
</P>
<P>
   After half a century, however, the France family turned over
control of stock-car racing's governing body on Wednesday. Bill
France Jr., who replaced his father as NASCAR president in 1972,
relinquished control of the organization's daily operations to Mike
Helton, the vice president of competition since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, former general manager at Atlanta Motor Speedway, was
named senior vice president and chief operating officer. France
Jr., 66, will remain as president, although he concedes that his
position will be largely ceremonial. ``I'm going to back out the
door,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   France said his decision is not because of health. He will keep
his position as CEO of International Speedway Corp., which owns the
Daytona and Talladega tracks and four others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in 1933,'' France said. ``You've got to do it
sometime, and I guess (now) is as good of a time as any. ... I
think Mike's ready, but that's not going to make it any easier to
walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement also lines up Helton, 45, as France's successor
as president when he retires. Brian France, France's son, is
NASCAR's senior vice president and handles most marketing and
licensing decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Under France, NASCAR evolved from a regional attraction in the
South into a national one. NASCAR attracted more than 6 million
fans to its 33 Winston Cup races last year, an average of 190,940
per event, including practice, qualifying and race day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, France negotiated a deal with CBS to televise the
Daytona 500, the sports' premier event. Now, every Winston Cup and
Busch Grand National race is telecast nationally, either on a
network or on cable.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the sport expanded, moving from smaller markets
to the major metro areas of Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The France family is the sport,'' said Ray Evernham, crew
chief for two-time defending Cup champion Jeff Gordon. ``It's not
what they've done for the sport; they are the sport.

 &HT;    France family puts stamp on NASCAR
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You can keep your Sterns and your Tagliabues. And hold
the Seligs.
</P>
<P>
   The modern commissioner is a capable corporate juggler at best.
At worst, a grinning figurehead with all the authority of a movie
usher.
</P>
<P>
   To find the last of the great empire builders in sports these
days one looked to NASCAR, where the France family had raised stock
car racing from the bootlegger's shack to the luxury skybox. There
was a single vision, and it was Bill France Sr.'s. There was a
single opinion on improving the plan, and that was Bill Jr.'s. It
was just one of those racing deals. And the autocracy made many
rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
   The junior France announced Wednesday that he was stepping back
from the daily watering and fertilizing of NASCAR, taking with him
the sport's founding surname. It's like a Steinway leaving the
piano business, a Spalding walking away from balls.
</P>
<P>
   A new sounding name, Mike Helton, now will be charged with
keeping the Fords, Chevys and Pontiacs reasonably happy. His
promotion signals the intention to keep NASCAR's focus on what got
it here. He's a car guy, who as vice president of competition did
all the mechanical fine-tuning that drivers and crew chiefs love to
debate. He kept such terms ``spoiler'' and ``front-air dam'' alive
and hot. While the next generation of France, Brian, cast his lot
with the merchandising end of the business.
</P>
<P>
   An era passes quietly. Junior was in tow in 1934 when Bill and
Annie France fled Washington D.C., stopped the family car on the
hard-sand beach of Daytona to take a quick swim and ended up
staying a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   What Bill France, the original, did then was race a little and
dream a lot. He had this idea that there was more to racing than
grease under the nails and dirt on the face. In 1947, he gathered
some fellow promoters at a hotel bar and mid-wifed NASCAR. The
organization's first address was France's service station.
</P>
<P>
   France handed the business over to his son in 1972, twenty years
before his death. It was the second year of racing's marriage with
Big Cigarette. The Daytona 500 was a part of the culture. The
circuit was just begining to break out of its Southern boundaries.
The styles of father and son were a little different, but they
shared a real low tolerance for nonsense or distractions. They
accomplished stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're racing in the deserts of Las Vegas and Phoenix, and
the green hills of New Hampshire. They've invaded the open-wheel
holy ground of Indianapolis. They're even racing in Japan, home to
the hated Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the Frances for the traffic, as NASCAR's popularity has
outgrown infrastructure. Blame them for a loss of soul, as the
humble tracks and the hardcore fans get pushed aside in the name of
progress. Blame them for night racing. Blame them for turning
drivers into multi-media celebrities. Sponsors and giant track
owners like Bruton Smith have helped shape racing, but the France
name is on every aspect of this boom time.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR never had a player's strike or an owner's lockout. The
drivers do not appear regularly at your local police precint.
Salaries are not the dominant theme. All in all, it has been a
pretty good run.

 &HT;    Humble start launched Helton rise
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ In the early 1970s, Mike Helton took his
first job in automobile racing, operating a concessions stand as a
teenager at Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than two decades later, Helton will be in charge of
the whole operation as NASCAR's senior vice president and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR president Bill France Jr. said on Wednesday that Helton
would assume control of the organization's day-to-day operations.
The promotion probably means Helton eventually will replace France
as NASCAR president.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started working at Bristol, I didn't have a clue
what I wanted to do,'' Helton said. ``I never dreamed I'd come this
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton spent a few years driving the dirt tracks of the Blue
Ridge Mountains as a teenager. After wrecking more than his share
of race cars, though, Helton said, it was obvious his future wasn't
on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured out pretty quick I wasn't much of a driver,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Helton crossed the state line to Tennessee, selling drinks and
popcorn part-time on the weekends at Bristol Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   He got his first big break in stock-car racing when the three
original owners of Bristol sold the track to Lanny Hester and Gary
Baker of Nashville after the 1976 Winston Cup season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did everything, cutting grass, painting walls, picking up
trash and selling advertising,'' Helton said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Helton moved to Atlanta to serve as public-relations
director at what was then known as Atlanta International Raceway.
By January 1985, Helton was promoted to be the track's general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Helton held that role for more than a year before joining the
France family's International Speedway Corp. in June 1986. He
started his career with ISC at Daytona International Speedway,
working in promotions and marketing development.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1989, he was named a vice president of ISC and
president at Talladega Superspeedway. He was moved back to Daytona
in 1994 and served as NASCAR's vice president of competition until
Wednesday's promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was in Atlanta, I didn't have many dealings with
him,'' France said. ``I didn't have as much (in Daytona) because he
was over in the marketing side. When he went to Talladega, though,
I had an awful lot of dealings with him. Needless to say, I was
certainly impressed with his analytical ability. He was able to
sort things out and not shoot from the hip. He's fulfilled all of
our expectations on the NASCAR side.''
</P>
<P>
   In his former role, Helton oversaw NASCAR's garage area, serving
as the governing body's liaison to drivers, crew chiefs and car
owners in both the Winston Cup and Busch Grand National circuits.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Winston Cup Series director Gary Nelson, Helton
spearheaded NASCAR's inspections. He also oversaw approval of the
Ford Taurus last year. This year, he's working closely with
Chevrolet in developing the new Monte Carlo, which still is
awaiting approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anybody in the garage area unhappy with
that announcement,'' said Ray Evernham, crew chief for Jeff Gordon.
``He's a super guy. When you went to talk to him, he'd listen.
Whenever you've got a problem and you call him, he'll call you
back. He'll sit and listen to you and won't fly off and get
excited, scream and holler. I don't think you'll find anyone that's
unhappy with it.''
</P>
<P>
   One year after its 50th anniversary season, NASCAR faces several
questions, many of which center on its future. At the top of
Helton's list is growth. The Winston Cup season already includes 34
races, but several tracks, including Las Vegas and Texas, are
requesting second dates.
</P>
<P>
   Speedways also are under construction in Chicago, Kansas City
and Kentucky, and plans are being completed for tracks in Baltimore
and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can grow a little bit more after talking with the
competitors, as long as we do it smartly,'' Helton said. ``We've
got to schedule the races correctly. Transportation is an issue,
but with the transporters and airplanes, we get around better than
we ever have.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the 34 points races and the Bud Shootout and The Winston,
we've got 36 events in 1999. The issue would be, can you make it
37, 38 or 39? We think there's still room, but we just don't know
how much.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton takes over the daily operations from France Jr., who will
remain as president. But the France family still will have a

 &HT;    Sponsorless owner can't keep rookie
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Longtime Winston Cup owner Junie Donlavey
Jr. thought he arrived at Daytona International Speedway with a
sponsor for his No. 90 Ford.
</P>
<P>
   With only four days remaining before NASCAR's biggest event,
however, Donlavey says he still doesn't have a sponsorship check
from Big Daddy's Barbecue of Oklahoma, which produces sauces,
spices and meats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather they just forget this and not go through with
it,'' Donlavey said. ``I would rather just release them and we go
and look for someone else. You feel like you've been taken
advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Donlavey replaced Winston Cup rookie Mike Harmon
with veteran Mike Wallace as his driver for Sunday's Daytona 500.
Donlavey says Harmon's ride was contingent on Big Daddy's coming
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had Big Daddy's, we had money to be able to take some
time to bring a boy along, like Harmon,'' Donlavey said. ``It looks
like Big Daddy's has gone down the drain. . . . We like Mike, and
we wanted to go with him. But with the sponsor not coming through,
it put us back a lot further than we needed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Donlavey said he decided to replace Harmon, a short-track
specialist from Alabama, on Tuesday night. After agreeing to drive
the No. 90 Ford, Wallace was scrambling to find a doctor for
medical clearance, as well as equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went over and borrowed four shocks from (brother) Rusty's
(Wallace) team just to get us a baseline,'' Wallace said. ``I had
to go find a set of ear molds and gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace ran one Cup race last season, finishing 23rd and
collecting $86,105 in the Daytona 500. Wallace will drive full-time
in the Craftsman Truck Series this year, and his deal with Donlavey
appears to be for only Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace will start 24th in today's first Gatorade 125 qualifying
race, and must finish in the top 14 to make the Daytona 500 field.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Harmon is holding out hope that Big Daddy's comes
through and that he's back in Donlavey's car at North Carolina
Speedway on Feb. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a done deal,'' he said. ``We're not through running
Winston Cup this year, even with the No. 90. The sponsorship
package was on top of the fence, and it could fall either way.''
</P>
<P>
   GATORADE 125S
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying for Sunday's Daytona 500 resumes today at 12:30 p.m.
with the Gatorade 125 twin races. Each race will include 30
drivers, including Jeff Gordon and Tony Stewart, who will sit on
the poles of races 1 and 2, respectively. The twin races determine
positions 3-30 of the Daytona 500 field, so some drivers starting
near the back will have to move through the field to qualify for
the race.
</P>
<P>
   DISQUALIFIED
</P>
<P>
   Lance Hooper, who qualified for the No. 26 spot in Saturday's
NAPA Auto Parts 300 Busch race, was disqualified after
post-qualifying inspection found parts had been altered to allow
more air into the manifold.
</P>
<P>
   Races at Daytona and Talladega are run using restrictor plates,
which reduce the airflow through the carburetor to reduce speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper won't participate in the race, allowing Brad Loney, who
qualified 37th, to move into the field in the No. 36 spot.

 &HT;    Drivers endorse choice
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Bill France Jr. spent the past 26 years
shaping NASCAR into America's fastest-growing spectator sport, but
the sport's drivers say stock car racing won't miss a beat with
Mike Helton running the show.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers, crew members and owners say they were surprised at
Wednesday's announcement that France was handing over day-to-day
operations to Helton.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup teams learned the news in the garage area of Daytona
International Speedway, while the announcement was being made in
the Benny Kahn Infield Media Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, if you've been around as long as I have, I saw the same
thing happen with (Bill France Sr.), when he passed the torch to
Billy,'' veteran driver Darrell Waltrip said. ``It looks to me like
they're doing about the same thing. I've watched Mike Helton over
the last couple of years here. He's a very capable man of doing the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who spent the past five years as NASCAR's vice president
of competition, received an overwhelming endorsement from drivers
and owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't come to me, but if they came to me and said they
were getting ready to do this and asked me who I thought would be
the guy, Mike Helton would be my choice,'' said Jack Roush, who
owns five Winston Cup teams, including the No. 6 Ford of Mark
Martin. ``Mike has got maturity, he's got wisdom, and he's
certainly embroiled in France's philosophy of stock-car racing, so
it'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Irvan, driver of the No. 36 Pontiac, credits Helton with
helping to revive his career after a nearly fatal accident during
practice at Michigan Speedway on Aug. 20, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan, who was given only a 10 percent chance of survival
immediately after the wreck, was hospitalized for several weeks,
but returned to racing after only 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike has really played a major part in my career,'' Irvan
said. ``When I was trying to come back from my injuries, Mike kept
a close eye on everything that was going on. He's a very personable
person. We know that him being bumped up is definitely a positive
note for NASCAR.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say they hope that France, who says he'll spend much of
his extra time fishing, will still be a familiar sight at race
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill deserves to take some time off,'' said Michael Kranefuss,
who owns the No. 12 Ford of Jeremy Mayfield. ``He's got some good
people in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that he'll be around in case his presence is
needed, but I really think that Mike is the man that can take it
from here. What Bill's done for the sport of auto racing, his whole
family, it's remarkable, and I hope he's going to be around for a
long, long time.

U.S. WILL ADD TO RESERVE OF OIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To shore up the nation's shrinking protection
against oil emergencies, the Clinton administration will announce
on Thursday that it plans to add oil to the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve for the first time since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the reserve, the government will take royalty payments
for wells on federal land in oil rather than money. The decision
represents the first time since 1990 that the government has
dedicated new resources to buying oil; then, Congress voted money
for purchases .
</P>
<P>
   The move is a sharp turnaround in policy and a hedge against a
threat that looms ever smaller in the popular imagination. The
strategic reserve was conceived as a billion-barrel shield against
gasoline lines like the ones that formed during the Arab oil
embargo of 1973-74 and again during the Iranian revolution of 1979.
</P>
<P>
   But the reserve reached only a little more than half its
expected level, and it has shrunk precipitously in the last few
years as millions of barrels have been sold _ at a loss of $10 a
barrel or so _ to help balance the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Imports have grown by 60 percent since the Arab oil embargo as
the country has switched to sport utility vehicles and domestic
wells have run dry.
</P>
<P>
   The oil remaining in the reserve, 561 million barrels,
represents about 60 days of imports. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990 and import levels were lower, the reserve had nearly 90 days'
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Many oil experts, though doubtful that another war in the
Mideast would produce shortages, given the free-flowing world oil
market, say that crude oil would soar in price.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson plans on Thursday to announce
that the government will replace the 28 million barrels sold over
the last few years at a rate of about 150,000 barrels a day,
drawing on the government's 200,000-barrel-a-day royalties from
offshore wells in the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department and the Interior Department, which
collects the royalties, already have authority to transfer the oil
and no Congressional action is needed, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time to take this step is now, when prices are low and
when we can save for a rainy day,'' Richardson said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Oil for March delivery Wednesday was $11.75 a barrel in New
York. By contrast, the average purchase price of oil in the reserve
is around $27 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   At the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York, John
H. Lichtblau said that adding to the reserve was sensible. ``With
the uncertainty in the Middle East, it's a lot cheaper than having
military operations,'' he said. More of the world's oil will come
from the Mideast as the years go by, he said.

 E-Mail's Security Called Shoddy  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Millions of people who get free e-mail services from Yahoo, Hotmail
and Excite are subject to hacker attacks because their privacy
protections are so poor, a nationally known Internet security
expert said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Winkler, a former analyst for the National Security Agency,
said these accounts are easy to break into because they allow an
unlimited number of log-on attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody can try every possible password to get into the
system,'' said Winkler. ``They will get in eventually _ and you
will never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackers can create software programs that will automate password
selection, going through countless combinations of numbers and
letters until hitting on the right one.
</P>
<P>
   Other security experts confirmed Winkler's observation, saying
it is just one of the security weaknesses of the free e-mail
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, you should look a gift horse in the mouth,''
said Peter Neumann, an expert in computer security at SRI
International, a Menlo Park research firm. Companies that offer
free services, don't spend a lot of time worrying about security,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some paid e-mail services, including America Online, and most
corporate networks will lock out users after a certain number of
failed log-on attempts. In such cases, the user is often e-mailed
about the failed log-in trys and told to contact system
administrators who verify the user's identity, Winkler said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hotmail, recently acquired by Microsoft, and Excite issued
statements yesterday saying they offer protections for e-mail
customers.
</P>
<P>
   MSN Hotmail has ``no knowledge of any Hotmail accounts ever
being compromised'' because of unlimited log-in attempts, said
product manager Laura Norman. Hotmail ``has plans in place to
implement a solution'' to address the problem, Norman said, but she
could not provide any details.
</P>
<P>
   Excite said it gives users the ability ``to protect their e-mail
accounts with longer passwords than other free e-mail services.
Accounts protected with long passwords can be more difficult to
hack as they are more difficult to decipher.'' The Redwood Shores
Internet company did not directly address the log-on issue.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo did not respond to a request for comment yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler, now a private Internet security consultant in Maryland,
disclosed his security concerns in a column yesterday on ZDTV's Web
site ( &LR; www.zdnet.com/zdtv &LR; ). He said he was working on a column
about free e-mail when the question of password security came up.
Just to experiment, he tried to break in and found it surprisingly
simple to randomly find a user's password.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't have to be so easy, security experts said. First, the
services should require users to choose a strong password _ one
that is seven characters or more and is a combination of letters
(uppercase and lowercase) and numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The services also should not allow an unlimited number of log-on
attempts, and they should notify users if someone has been trying
to get into their account, Winkler said. Although Yahoo asks users
if they need help after three failed log-ins, it does not prevent
them from trying again and again.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail users can take some preventive measures, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't pick anything that is too simple or too easily
identified with you,'' said Peter Shipley, who gained notoriety _
not to mention the nickname ``Evil Pete'' _ by hacking into
computer systems at the University of California at Berkeley in the
1980s. He is now a computer-security consultant for KPMG in Silicon
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Other advice: Use a different password for each e-mail account
or, if that's too difficult, a different password for different
types of accounts: one for work and one for home, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But even the best password may be vulnerable, he said, because
Excite, Yahoo and the other Internet companies send password and
user ID information as plain text that is not encrypted. In these
cases, sophisticated computer users can use software programs known
as ``sniffers'' to grab your data as it travels over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: be careful what you say in e-mail, Shipley
said. ``E-mail sent over the Internet should be treated as if it
were a postcard _ and not necessarily private.''

BRUINS TO GET TASTE OF MAPLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   During their high school careers, UCLA's freshmen played
throughout the country and on several continents. They encountered
prep all-star teams and junior national teams. They played in
bandbox gyms and spacious arenas. But nothing prepared them for
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   There is no place like Stanford's Maples Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like anything they've experienced before,'' UCLA
sophomore Travis Reed said. ``It's the worst place to play in the
Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   Three factors will conspire to make tonight's experience unique:
at home, following a loss to Connecticut, Stanford probably will
play at a higher level than any team UCLA has faced; the fans, who
are part-funny, part-crude and completely raucous; finally, there's
that floor, basketball on a wooden trampoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the great home-court advantages in college
basketball,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``The floor shakes.
You have to shoot at a moving basket.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's veterans _ sophomores Reed, Earl Watson and Baron Davis _
were indoctrinated last year in a 13-point Stanford victory. Only
junior Sean Farnham and senior Brandon Loyd experienced the Maples
Massacre, UCLA's 48-point loss at Stanford in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years, the Bruins have the size and depth
to counterpunch. And like Stanford antagonists Arizona and
Connecticut, they have the quickness to disrupt the Cardinal
offense.
</P>
<P>
   But quickness is half the equation. Do the Bruins have the
structure _ the fundamentals, discipline and poise _ necessary to
defeat a team that exists on a different plane of precision? The
Bruins could be the quickest team in basketball history, but
without smarts and fundamentals, Stanford will carve them like a
turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to push the tempo, not get into a grinder game,''
Reed said. ``If we slow it down, it'll be to their advantage, but
we have to be smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially the freshmen. UCLA cannot survive on sophomores
alone. The freshmen must contribute in their varying states of
health and spirits. Forward Jerome Moiso expects to play but will
not be at full speed because of tendinitis on the bottom of his
foot. Center Dan Gadzuric is plagued by tendinitis in his knees.
How will they react to the Maples court?
</P>
<P>
   Has forward JaRon Rush's recovered from his one-game benching
for poor practice attitude? How will Alameda native Ray Young react
to familiar territory? And what of Matt Barnes, whose playing time
fluctuates wildly? Will his recent progress continue?
</P>
<P>
   So many questions and only one answer. Stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   Clunk and clank: If the game is decided on the foul line, it
might be a forfeit. UCLA is the worst free-throw shooting team in
the conference (59 percent) and Stanford is dropping fast after a
12-of-24 performance against Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   They have a similar problem: the most-fouled players _
Stanford's Mark Madsen and UCLA's Baron Davis _ are among the worst
shooters. Davis has taken 30 more free throws than any UCLA player
and is shooting 59.6 percent. Madsen has taken 65 more free throws
than any Cardinal and is shooting 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them that front rim misses are on them, and back rim
misses are on me,'' Lavin said. ``Ninety percent of our misses are
(front rim) because we're not extending and following through.''
</P>
<P>
   A clarification: There was some confusion Sunday about the
reason Gadzuric did not start. UCLA officials said his tendinitis
was the problem, Lavin said is was a lethargic practice Saturday,
and Gadzuric claimed ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason he did not start was because he did not practice to
the (proper) level of intensity,'' Lavin said Tuesday. ``We told
Dan before the game that he wouldn't start.''
</P>
<P>
   Case closed.

   BOOK REVIEW

<P>
   Active Wellness
</P>
<P>
   Time Life Books, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   A motivating guide to a lifetime of healtful living, ``Active
Wellness'' shows how to balance the demands of career and family
with your mental and physical well-being. Author Gayle Reichler
says the success of her program is that it recognizes that ``no one
diet, exercise regimen, stress management plan, or behavioral
change can possibly be right for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Far beyond the days of ``No Pain, No Gain,'' the '90s' holistic
approach to health treats the person: mind, body, and spirit. A
registered dietitian, Reichler furthered that concept as a
corporate wellness coach for megacompanies such as NBC, Sony,
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, and McGraw-Hill. She gained further respect after
bringing the success of the Active Wellness program to New York's
respected Beth Israel Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The key to long-term success with the Active Wellness program's
10 steps is to understand your health needs and history. In
addition to other valuable tools, you'll learn how to start a
personalized eating plan, form new healthful habits, manage stress,
cook low-fat foods that are actually edible, and deal with the
things that can sabotage success.

SNAKE VENOM AND THERAPY BY ZAPPING

<TEXT>
<P>
   NO SNAKE OIL
</P>
<P>
   An experimental drug derived from the venom of a pit viper is
helping stroke victims recover their physical and mental abilities,
according to scientists reporting at last week's American Heart
Association International Conference on Stroke and Cerebral
Circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Results of a 500-person trial of the drug ANCROD (not yet
approved by the FDA) found that 42 percent of those treated with
the drug within three hours of stroke onset regained their
pre-stroke faculties.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers discovered that in people who were bitten by the
snake, blood did not clot, leading to speculation that the venom
could be used as an anticoagulant, helping blood flow more freely
through vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ZAP THE PAIN
</P>
<P>
   Electrical nerve stimulation may help reduce chronic pain in
cancer patients, especially those whose cancer has spread to the
bones, say researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical School in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Some cancers that spread to bones produce severe chronic pain
that is unresponsive to analgesic drugs, including morphine.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists report that percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
(PENS), a technique that involves the insertion of acupuncturelike
needles into the soft tissue surrounding bones, produces
significant pain relief. During the procedure, an electrical
current is passed through the needles, apparently disrupting normal
pain signals by stimulating local nerves.
</P>
<P>
   PENS may reduce the need for narcotics and other more invasive
procedures but should be used to complement, not eliminate, other
pain-management techniques, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   BIGGEST KILLER
</P>
<P>
   On an average day in Texas, 156 people die of cardiovascular
diseases, according to data released last week by the Texas
affiliate of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Heart disease remains the No. 1 killer in Texas, claiming the
lives of 57,050 people in 1997 (40 percent of the 142,569 Texas
residents who died). Cancer was the second leading cause of death,
claiming 32,144 lives.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce your risk, keep blood pressure under control, eat
nutritious foods in moderate amounts, have regular checkups,
exercise and don't smoke. .MDBR/.MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's

SEAGRAM TO RETAIN INTERNATIONAL ARM OF POLYGRAM FILMED
ENTERTAINMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- Universal Studios announced Wednesday
it will launch its own foreign movie distribution arm by using the
international operations of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The move means Seagram Co., Universal's parent, has decided to
keep at least part of PFE rather than selling it. Seagram sold off
the PFE film library in two deals totaling $400 million, but has
not yet decided if it will sell PFE's domestic operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two months of extensive evaluation in determining the
most amount of value PFE brings to Universal, we have concluded
that retaining PolyGram's international operations provides the
strongest strategic advantage,'' Ron Meyer, president of Universal
Studios, said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   The move underscores the increasing importance of foreign
markets in the movie business. Foreign receipts amounted to $10.87
billion last year, or 60.8 percent of the worldwide box office.
Baskerville Communications has forecast that figure will hit $15.37
billion, or 65.6 percent, by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   PFE, which will retain its identity, distributes films directly
in nine countries and uses its London office for sales in the rest
of the world. Its top upcoming movies include ``Notting Hill'' with
Julia Roberts, ``The Green Mile'' with Tom Hanks and ``Being John
Malkovich'' with Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   PFE's international president, Stewart Till, will continue to
head the operation, which owns or has output deals with Working
Title, Dirty Hands, DNA Pictures and Revolution Films.
Additionally, Universal will continue to use UIP -- its joint
venture with Paramount and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer -- to distribute its
own films overseas. The UIP agreement expires in October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram, which acquired PFE last year as part of its $10.4
billion buyout of music giant PolyGram NV, is also expected to
report quarterly earnings today with analysts forecasting profits
of 2 cents per share for its second quarter ended Dec. 31, compared
with 22 cents per share in the year-earlier period. The downturn is
due to feeble box office performance by ``Meet Joe Black'' and
``Babe: Pig in the City.''
</P>
<P>
   Seagram also announced in December that it would take a charge
of as much as $700 million for the cost of integrating PolyGram's
operations. Since then, 700 jobs have been cut at the combined
music operations and another 1,500 slots could disappear by the
time the restructuring is completed this summer.

ROMNEY'S CHANCES TO HEAD SLOC LOOKIN GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Mitt Romney could be named head of the
embattled Salt Lake Organizing Committee when the board of trustees
meets this morning, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Romney, the wealthy Belmont, Mass., venture capitalist and
former US Senate candidate, met with members of the selection panel
here Tuesday night and spent much of Wednesday conferring with
board members.
</P>
<P>
   The board's first task, however, will be to expand from 33 to 50
members and transform the 12-member executive committee into a
20-member management committee as part of a reorganization due to
the widening Olympic payoff scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Romney was identified last week as the top choice to replace
Frank Joklik, who resigned as chief executive last month. But the
board did not name a search committee until Tuesday, after the SLOC
ethics panel released a blistering 300-page report on a seven-year
campaign to induce International Olympic Committee members to name
the Utah capital host of the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not had a chance to talk about the issue in any
depth,'' said board chairman Robert Garff. ``We plan to talk about
it on Thursday. Whether we will be in a position to nominate
anybody remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Romney tops a decidedly short list that includes Dave Checketts,
the Madison Square Garden CEO and former Utah Jazz president.
Another potential candidate, Jon Huntsman Jr., a chemical company
vice chairman and former ambassador to Singapore, withdrew from
consideration after it became clear there would be no real search,
he told The Associated Press. He also rejected Leavitt's request
that he serve on SLOC's new management committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly has a lot of wherewithal to do the job,'' said
Garff, who is one of Romney's two prime boosters, along with Utah
Governor Mike Leavitt.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old Romney fulfills what Garff has said the board is
looking for in a ``white knight'' _ a prominent figure with Utah
roots, a business background, and a clean image.
</P>
<P>
   Romney, who has made hundreds of millions of dollars as chief of
Boston-based Bain Capital, is a Mormon and former Brigham Young
University valedictorian who owns a winter home in nearby Park
City.
</P>
<P>
   Though Romney wants the job, a source close to him said he
needed to familiarize himself with the ethics report and was
concerned that some board members with business ties to the SLOC
may have conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Alan Layton heads a construction company that is
building the roof for the Olympic speedskating oval, and Earl
Holding owns the Snowbasin ski resort, where the downhill races
will be held.

MARKET PLACE: WAVING THE CAUTION FLAG OVER CURRENCIES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia)    By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Although the fallout has been limited from Brazil's
sharp currency plunge last month, several countries could face
problems later this year either in raising money or in defending
their currencies.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no uniform measure of weakness, the Philippines,
Indonesia and Thailand rate a yellow caution flag along with
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   These four countries are not now teetering on the brink of
financial disaster, say financial analysts and economists who rank
countries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai economy shows signs of stabilizing. The nation has
improved its balance of trade, and its currency, the baht, has
rebounded 50 percent from the low in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines has been upgraded from a negative credit outlook
by Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. It sold $1 billion of bonds to global
investors in January, albeit at interest rates nearly twice the
yield on the 10-year Treasury note. It plans another sale in Europe
in March.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia is not as well off. Its currency has slumped more
sharply than Thailand's and the Philippines' in the wake of
Brazil's devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   But financial analysts say these countries and Brazil are
vulnerable should world financial markets tighten up. If there is
another flight from risk by investors, credit could dry up for
them. Or if China devalues its currency, the yuan, there could be a
fresh run on their currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these countries has a significant amount of debt and
interest to pay this year, including loans to banks and bonds sold
globally to investors. Based on government, corporate and private
debt figures compiled by ING Barings, Brazil owes $53 billion in
the next 12 months, Thailand $27.8 billion, Indonesia $27.7 billion
and the Philippines $10.2 billion. They could find it very
expensive, or impossible, to raise money to meet those obligations
if investors lose confidence in emerging-market debt.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, much of the downward pressure on its currency has
stemmed from the fear that the country will default on its local
and foreign borrowings or will be forced to restructure the debt in
a way that will hurt investors. Short-term interest rates in Brazil
have shot up to about 40 percent, and its long-term debt carries a
rate of 15.7 percent. Concerns about Brazil have pushed up interest
rates elsewhere in Latin America as well.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Brazilian central government scrambled to prevent
a default by its second biggest state, Minas Gerais, on $108
billion of Eurobonds by paying the portion the state could not.
</P>
<P>
   Along with needing to raise money in the capital markets, all
four countries have currencies that would be very hard to defend
without raising interest rates sharply, because they lack the
foreign reserves needed for a vigorous defense.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries appear vulnerable, but merit less concern
because they lack the same combination of debt and currency
weakness. Argentina, for example, is on the danger list prepared by
ING Barings that concentrates on borrowing needs. But it is not on
a watch list assembled by Lehman Brothers that focuses on the
currency outlook. That is because Argentina has an ample amount of
dollar reserves and has linked its currency, the peso, to the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries that appear high on one of the two lists are the
Czech Republic, Hungary, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, South Africa,
South Korea and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The ING Barings list, compiled under the direction of Arturo C.
Porzecanski, chief economist for the Americas, looks at government
and private debt due in the next 12 months to commercial and
investment banks around the world. He compares this total to the
liquid assets of these countries, their companies and their
citizens in banks and investment banks abroad. This produces a
ratio that he uses to rank a country's risk of defaulting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If what comes due substantially exceeds what is deposited,
there could be trouble,'' Porzecanski said.
</P>
<P>
   He uses bank loan and deposit data from the Bank of
International Settlements. The data show that Russia's debt is
equal to 241 percent of its deposits abroad. Indonesia is second at
229 percent, followed by Thailand at 226 percent, Hungary at 207
percent. South Africa ranks fifth by this measure at 126 percent
and Argentina comes in just under 100 percent. Brazil, which spent
about $30 billion in reserves defending its currency, will break
into the Top 10 when the loan and asset data is updated in May,
Porzecanski said.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela, which has a new president, has been named as a
potential casualty of Brazil's currency woes by many investors. But
it is 30th on Porzecanski's watch list, formally known as the
Sovereign Liquidity Risk Indicator. ``Venezuela, he said, ``may be
safer than many think, as its short-term liabilities are greatly
exceeded by its assets, both official and private.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lehman Brothers list, formerly known as the Foreign Exchange
Liquidity Vulnerability Ranking, uses a risk barometer based on a
country's dollar reserves. This reserve level is compared with the
hypothetical amount needed to make a full defense against capital
flight without resorting to unsustainable high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   By this measure, Brazil, Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea, and
Mexico rank number two to number six and are still extremely
vulnerable. China is number one, but it has certain controls on its
economy and a currency that is not convertible. ``So it would be
tough to put together a run against the central bank,'' said Jose
M. Barrionuevo, Lehman's director of global market strategy.
</P>
<P>
   A deepening currency crisis in Brazil would not be the kind of
catalyst that it would have been last October, Barrionuevo said. A
Chinese devaluation, though, would probably lead to another run on
currencies in emerging markets, he predicted. Other Asian countries
would feel pressured to let their currencies fall so that their
exports would be competitive with China's. Fears of such
devaluations would prompt local investors and local companies to
sell their currencies to avoid losses. That would herald the kind
of selling that marked the beginning of the Asian financial crisis
in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's, a traditional credit rating agency,
concentrates on what measures a government is taking ``to ride out
the storm,'' said David Beers, managing director of S&AMP;P's sovereign
ratings group.
</P>
<P>
   Some countries, like like Romania and Kazakhstan, have been
``like deer caught in the headlights,'' he said. Argentina, on the
other hand, has done a lot. ``It is our view that the government
reacted very quickly to this crisis,'' he said of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The credit agencies have been criticized in the past for not
moving quickly enough. On the other hand, they tend to avoid
knee-jerk overreactions. During the Mexican peso crisis of late
1994 and 1995, only Mexico received an S&AMP;P downgrade.
</P>
<P>
   But these ratings provide as mixed a picture as the other
systems. Thailand _ which merits concern from ING Barings and
Lehman _ has an investment-grade credit rating from S&AMP; P, though it
is on the cusp of falling into junk bond status. It does have a
negative outlook _ meaning the next move would be down to junk
status.

   BOSTON _ The FleetCenter has applied to the NCAA to host the
women's basketball Final Four in 2004. Harvard and Northeastern
would serve as co-hosts for the event, which would mark the first
time a women's basketball championship has been held in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be terrific for the area; it will be a lot of
fun,'' said Harvard athletic director Bill Cleary Wednesday. ``I'd
love to see us get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA women's site committee is studying bids to host the
women's Final Four in 2003 and 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the preliminary stages of just gathering applications
now,'' said Tricia Burke, the NCAA head of the women's selection
committee. ``We'll be sorting through those in the next several
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA will announce the potential sites next week and pare
the list to a handful of finalists by the end of March. ``The
committee will then make on-site inspections,'' said Burke, who
added that many factors beyond the actual venue are taken into
consideration. ``The committee will look at the city as a whole and
decide if it can handle an event like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The FleetCenter hosted a men's hockey Final Four last year and
will host first- and second-round NCAA men's basketball tournament
games March 12 and 14.
</P>
<P>
   Although the NCAA has no written policy on geographical sites,
it prefers to move its championship venues to different areas of
the country each year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's women's Final Four will be in San Jose, Calif. Next
year it will be in Philadelphia. St. Louis and San Antonio are the
sites for 2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The final decision and announcement on 2004 will be in late
June.

AVERSTAR TO BUY COMPUTER BASED SYSTEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Government software contractor AverStar Inc. plans to announce
Thursday the purchase of another computer services firm, in a deal
valued at roughly $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   AverStar, based in Burlington, Mass., said it plans to acquire
Computer Based Systems Inc. of Fairfax, Va., bringing AverStar's
total yearly revenue to nearly $200 million and adding about 600
employees to the 1,300 who presently work for the firm.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase will help AverStar compete for service contracts
for federal agencies where CBSI has been more successful than
AverStar to date, said AverStar chairman and chief executive
Michael Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Those agencies include the Patent &AMP; Trademark Office, the
Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Labor.
AverStar is best known for testing and developing software for the
Navy, the Postal Service, NASA and the Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes as part of an expansion campaign meant to
increase AverStar's annual revenues to $500 million by 2002.
According to Alexander, an increase to that size will make the firm
more competitive with rivals like EDS and Computer Sciences Corp.
at a time when government contracting procedures are changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal government competitions are offering larger and
longer-term contracts, and we need to be able to convince them that
we're able to handle it,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   Specific terms of the agreement weren't available. But a person
familiar with the transaction said it valued CBSI at around 60
percent of its 1998 revenue of $40 million, indicating a purchase
price of about $24 million _ in line with prices for similar firms.
</P>
<P>
   AverStar was formed a year ago as a combination of two other
software services firms, Intermetrics Inc. of Burlington, Mass. and
Pacer Infotech Inc. of Billerica, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the company is now controlled by former
Intermetrics shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with CBSI represents the first large purchase by
AverStar since the merger. About 85 percent of AverStar's revenue
now comes from work for public agencies.
</P>
<P>
   To support further growth, AverStar is considering an initial
offering of public stock later this year, said company vice
president Paul Serotkin.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that an IPO isn't likely until after the
purchase of CBSI is completed in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, CBSI founder and president
Mohan Kapani will retire and the unit will henceforth be headed by
Richard W. Zins, previously vice president of the company's
services group.

FRANKLIN ASBURY LONG, PROFESSOR WHO ADVOCATED ARMS REDUCTIONS, DIES
AT 88  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., Texas, Ore . )  By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Franklin Asbury Long, an emeritus professor at Cornell
University, former government adviser and advocate of international
arms reductions, died on Monday at a nursing home in Pomona, Calif.
He was 88 and had lived in Ithaca, N.Y., and Claremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A chemist by training, Long was a member of the President's
Science Advisory Committee in the administrations of Dwight D.
Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. He also was
assistant director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
in the early 1960s. His subsequent nomination as director of the
National Science Foundation ran afoul of officials in President
Richard M. Nixon's White House because of Long's opposition to its
antiballistic missile project.
</P>
<P>
   Heralded as a pillar of the country's nuclear defense strategy,
the missiles project stirred controversy from the start, and Long
had earlier argued in The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that
the government's attempts to develop the antiballistic missile
would create ``strong pressure toward acceleration of the arms
race.''
</P>
<P>
   When a board of scientists nominated Long to be director of the
National Science Foundation, he went to Washington for an
appointment with Nixon, but later recalled that he learned from a
presidential science aide that things had changed because of the
missile matter. The White House disapproved of Long's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists voiced alarm over the implication that the
government wanted to hear only from advisers who agreed with its
policies. The White House later relented on the foundation
director's post, but Long then declined the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Asbury Long was born in Great Falls, Mont., and
graduated from the University of Montana in 1931, where he also
earned a master's degree in 1932. He obtained his doctorate in
chemistry in 1935 at the University of California at Berkeley,
where he began his academic career as an instructor.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Cornell faculty in Ithaca, N.Y., in 1937, and was
promoted to full professor in 1939, later serving as chairman of
the chemistry department. He was Cornell's vice president for
research and advanced studies in the 1960s and was named Henry Luce
Professor of Science and Society in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Long also directed the university's program on science,
technology and society and its peace studies program, retiring in
1979. He then moved to California, where he taught as an adjunct
professor at the University of California at Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   He was an editor of ``Weapons in Space'' (Norton, 1986), a
collection of essays on both sides of the debate involving
antimissile defenses and related technologies.
</P>
<P>
   He served on the boards of The Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, the Albert Einstein Peace Prize Foundation and the Fund
for Peace. He was also active in the international Pugwash movement
of scientists concerned about the world's arsenals of war.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Marion Thomas Long, died in 1992. Long is survived by
a son, Franklin, of Claremont; a daughter, Elizabeth Long of
Houston; a brother, George of Portland, Ore., and a grandson.

GINGERLY, FORD CHIEF DISCUSSES BMW 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Please note subslug for FORD-AUTO-SHOW)

 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Jacques Nasser, chief executive and president of Ford
Motor Co., said Wednesday that Ford would not try to buy BMW AG as
long as BMW wants to remain independent. He hinted, however, that
Ford would be interested in buying the German automaker if it puts
itself up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   BMW's board replaced the company's chairman last Friday, in a
sudden move that most industry executives attributed to the poor
performance of Britain's Rover, which BMW bought in 1994. BMW
officials have insisted since then that they want to remain
independent, but its stock has risen on the expectation that
pressure will increase for BMW to seek a merger.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters at the Chicago Auto Show, Nasser chose his
words with care, saying that he did not want to throw ``gasoline on
the fire'' of speculation about BMW's future. ``I wouldn't rule out
anything, but I think when a company with the stature of BMW and
its board come out and say they want to be independent, I have to
respect that,'' Nasser said.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked what Ford's position would be if BMW's insistence
on independence changed, Nasser replied: ``We never say never _ if
there's a tremendous opportunity out there, we always take a look
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   BMW has one of the best brand names and some of the finest
engineers in the auto industry.
</P>
<P>
   Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman, was replaced last Friday
and Wolfgang Reitzle, BMW's head of new-model development, resigned
when he was not chosen to replace him. German media reported
Wednesday that Reitzle would join Ford to run vehicle development;
Nasser would say only that he admired Reitzle and felt sympathy for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Ford agreed at the end of last month to buy the car-making
operations of Sweden's AB Volvo for $6.5 billion. The Quandt family
of Germany owns 46 percent of BMW.
</P>
<P>
   It would probably owe huge taxes in a cash sale of the
automaker. Such taxes could be avoided if Ford and BMW combined
their operations in a so-called ``pooling of interests'' and issued
stock in the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   But this could be difficult for Ford, because such a merger
might dilute the Ford family's controlling stake.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also plans to announce on Thursday that it will install
rigid oval hooks in the base of rear-seat cushions. Some current
child-restraint seats and all future models will latch easily to
the hooks.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators are expected to move as quickly as next week
to require the rigid hooks. Safety experts say the hooks are more
reliable than using seat belts to secure child restraint seats.

UTILITY COMPANIES NOT THE ONLY ONES BACKING DEREGULATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JACK Z. SMITH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It understandably makes Texans nervous when they hear that the
state's largest electric utility companies favor deregulation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it should make Texans much more comfortable to learn that
large segments of business and industry that are major electricity
users are enthusiastically backing deregulation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That includes everybody from Foley's department stores to
Motorola, the electronics giant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They are among the many members of a broad-based group called
the Texas Coalition for Competitive Electricity. The coalition
forecasts that deregulation will lead to lower electricity prices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I believe that indeed will be the case, if the Texas Legislature
has the wisdom to pass a good deregulation bill. It must be
structured to ensure strong price competition and provide adequate
consumer safeguards, particularly for residential customers.
Deregulation bills have been filed by two respected legislators,
state Sen. David Sibley, R-Waco, and state Rep. Steve Wolens,
D-Dallas. There's a good chance that the Legislature will approve a
deregulation bill in its current session. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It stands to reason that a deregulated market will increase
competition and lower prices, just as it generally has in the
airline and long-distance telephone businesses. Deregulation would
permit consumers to choose from whom they buy electricity, just as
they have a choice of long-distance phone services. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under deregulation, you could continue buying your electricity
from TU Electric or whatever utility serves you. Or you could
switch to another provider without requiring a new power line to
your home. With deregulation, new electricity providers could pay
access fees for the right to use the transmission networks of
long-existing utilities such as TU Electric. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now let's talk about the Coalition for Competitive Electricity.
It includes trade associations representing the electronics,
petroleum, chemical, concrete and forest products industries, as
well as operators of apartment complexes, restaurants, hotels and
service stations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coalition representatives predict that deregulation is likely to
lower electric bills by 8 to 10 percent, with savings potentially
reaching 15 to 20 percent in areas that now have
higher-than-average rates. And they predict that the savings will
be realized not only by large commercial and industrial consumers
but also homeowners and apartment dwellers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the coalition representatives is Chris Perrault,
utilities director for the huge Tricon restaurant chain that
includes Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC. Tricon has 1,300
company-owned and franchise restaurants in Texas alone. Nationally,
its nearly 20,000 restaurants spend $1.2 billion annually for
chicken and $800 million for cheese. But they also spend $450
million on energy, primarily for electricity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perrault said he is greatly encouraged by the initial results of
deregulation in Pennsylvania, where many residential customers
switching from Philadelphia Electric to other providers are
reducing their electric bills by 10 percent or more. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So why are utilities such as TU Electric and Houston Lighting &AMP;
Power backing deregulation? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's because they see the handwriting on the wall. At least 17
states have moved toward giving customers a choice of electricity
providers. In addition, the big Texas electric utilities saw their
enthusiasm for the current regulated market wane after a 1997
ruling by the state Public Utility Commission that lowered rates
charged by a large South Texas utility. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation won't guarantee lower rates. If prices were to
skyrocket for natural gas (which is burned to generate
electricity), electricity bills would probably jump whether the
market were deregulated or not. But deregulation clearly increases
the odds for lower prices, and that's all we consumers can ask
for. &QL;

SNACKWELL'S TRIES TO LINK ITS PRODUCTS AND MOTHER-DAUGHTER
RELATIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., N.Y.)  (af) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many companies brag about having a relationship with consumers.
But relationships come in a lot of varieties, and at RJR Nabisco,
executives in charge of Snackwell's want the relationship between
their lower-fat snack foods and their target market, the women of
America, to be meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   In what might be called the ``Our Cookies, Our Selves''
approach, the company is spending heavily on advertisements and
promotions that seek to form a treacly bond between Snackwell's
products and women's lives, with a particular emphasis on
motherhood. It's a drastic departure from the way Snackwell's was
promoted until recently, relying on the old standby 50-cents-off
coupon to drive sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women don't necessarily just want a transaction,'' said Terry
Preskar, Nabisco's senior business director for Snackwell's,
explaining the shift in emphasis. ``They want a relationship.
That's the way we are in our lives. We wanted to build a
relationship that would really drive deep loyalty to the brand, and
build in a reason for the purchase that goes above and beyond the
product. We want to stand for something.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Snackwell's will give away a paperback journal _
with the purchase of two boxes of Snackwell's products, that is _
that mothers and daughters can fill out for each other in time for
Mother's Day. To help people complete the task, the journal pages
have what Ms. Preskar called ``prompts,'' such as ``You made me
laugh when you did ___'' and ``You made me cry when you did ___.''
Participants then fill in the blanks. ``We've made it beautiful but
easy to do,'' Ms. Preskar said.
</P>
<P>
   And the company has allied itself with Girls Inc., a nonprofit
organization in Indianapolis whose motto emphasizes making girls
``strong, smart and bold.'' Snackwell's donated money to the group,
which has 350,000 members, and plans to sponsor four-hour workshops
in 27 cities that encourage mothers and daughters to talk to one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Print ads about the workshops, scheduled for the weekend after
Mother's Day, will run in women's magazines in April and May, and
information about the sites is available at www.snackwells.com, the
company's Web site. They are not free, however; participants must
pay $19.95 for each mother-daughter session and submit 10
Snackwell's proof-of-purchase labels.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company is continuing to run its television
commercials, created by the Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding Worldwide unit of
True North Communications, that carry the message ``Live well.
Snackwell.'' And to keep the momentum going, Nabisco is organizing
a direct-mail program derived from a data base that identifies big
Snackwell's purchasers and potential purchasers using sales
information from retailers.
</P>
<P>
   All this comes at a time when Ms. Preskar and others at Nabisco
are working hard to revive the Snackwell's brand, which soared on
its initial release but then declined drastically as other low-fat
products came along and the company's attention wandered.
</P>
<P>
   Sales peaked in 1995 and fell at double-digit rates until last
summer. In July, new products were added and old ones were
reformulated, all with more fat than the original versions but with
better taste, the company insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, the company called in Faith Popcorn, the
trendspotter, who identified women as Snackwell's biggest
customers. ``We suddenly looked at all the activities in the
marketing mix very differently,'' Ms. Preskar said. ``Consumers
still want coupons, but we asked, `How can we spend the rest of our
money in a way that will be really meaningful to women?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The effort seems to be helping, or at least not hindering. Sales
of Snackwell's ``turned around in the last few months,'' said Nomi
Ghez, a food analyst for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``Part of it is new
advertising, and part of it is better advertising and promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   More programs about relationships are in the works, but the
company chose to lead with the mother-daughter theme because even
in focus groups composed of people with no daughters, and no
children at all, there was a certain emotional resonance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was such support because every woman is a daughter,''
said Ms. Preskar, whose own daughter is 2. ``They have tremendous
heart for making things better for the next generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cause-related marketing _ look for Snackwell's to join the fight
against diseases and social problems that particularly afflict
women _ is generally an effective way for companies to project a
positive image, said David Walsh, president of the National
Institute on Media and the Family. The nonprofit group studies the
effect of advertising and other media on families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who can be against mothers and daughters having a better
relationship?'' he said. ``Ninety-nine percent of people would not
be against it. By linking their product to that particular
movement, the company is trying to create a halo effect, saying
that their product is somehow good for the family.''
</P>
<P>
   One analyst suggested that given the scant marketing of
Snackwell's until recently, almost any effort would help the brand.
Still, the improved flavor, which replaced what some had compared
to ``sugary straw,'' deserved at least partial credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snackwell's is really happy to have some money behind it,
finally,'' said Erika Gritman Long, a food analyst for J.P. Morgan.
``And the product tastes a lot better now than it ever has.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge issued an order on Wednesday for pilots at
American Airlines to return to work, apparently ending five days of
labor unrest that has grounded more than 2,500 flights and
inconvenienced tens of thousands of passengers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The order came none too soon for American, the country's
second-largest carrier, which canceled 906 flights on Wednesday, 40
percent of its 2,250 flights daily. It was the worst day since
hundreds of pilots began calling in sick on Saturday in a dispute
over American's recent purchase of Reno Air, a small airline in the
West. Without the court's intervention, the dispute threatened to
disrupt travel during the Presidents Day weekend, when flights at
most airlines are expected to be full.
</P>
<P>
   American said it expected most of the pilots to return to work.
Nonetheless, it said it would still have to cancel several hundred
flights on Thursday because many of its planes were out of position
because of the disruption. The airline said it expected service to
be back to normal by the weekend. It also announced that passengers
affected by this week's cancellations would be allowed to
reschedule their flights without penalty or to receive full
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing in Dallas on Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge
Joe Kendall castigated both the company, which had sought the court
order, and the Allied Pilots Association, the union that represents
American's 9,200 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's silly for us to even be here,'' he said. ``It's like
killing a gnat with a sledgehammer.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If you would look up bad labor relations in the
dictionary, you would have an American Airlines logo beside it.''
</P>
<P>
   But after listening to both sides, he agreed that the sickout
was illegal and ordered the pilots to return to the cockpit,
warning them that he would hold them in contempt if they did not.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders vowed to abide by the order, which barred the
pilots' association from making any concerted efforts to encourage
pilots to call in sick or otherwise withhold their services. But
the union has contended all along that the sickout was a
grass-roots protest that it did not control.
</P>
<P>
   There were 2,077 pilots out sick on Wednesday, American said.
Normally about 400 are on the sick list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to scrupulously comply with the order,'' said
Brian Mayhew, a captain and vice president of the union. ``That
will not remove the elements of frustration and anger that is in
the pilot group as a result of the fact that the company is not
addressing our core concerns in the negotiations.''

   The dispute between American and the pilots centers on how
American integrates Reno Air, the carrier in Nevada that American
bought in December for $124 million. American said it would take a
year to 18 months to integrate Reno's 25 airplanes and 300 pilots
into its operations. But the union says American is violating its
contract with the union, which requires all flying at the airline
to be done by its members. It is demanding that American integrate
Reno faster and pay pilots at both carriers as if the merger has
been completed.
</P>
<P>
   American's terminals at airports nationwide were largely quiet
on Wednesday, though passengers continued to complain of long
delays and poor service from American personnel. The airline
estimated that about 90,000 passengers were inconvenienced by the
day's cancellations and said it was doing its best to accommodate
passengers from canceled flights on later departures or on rival
airlines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE - OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the flights canceled at John F. Kennedy International
Airport in New York yesterday were five to San Francisco, two to
Los Angeles and two to Heathrow Airport in London.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Koumers said he had waited on the telephone for two hours
Tuesday night to try to find out the status of his trip to the
British Virgin Islands before finally giving up. He and his wife,
Jackie, arrived at Kennedy Airport from their home on Long Island
on Wednesday morning with their two daughters, ages 1 and 3, only
to find that their 11:30 a.m. flight to Puerto Rico had been
canceled. American then booked them on a Tower Air flight departing
nearly 12 hours later, at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent 60 bucks to get here in the limo with all the luggage
and the girls,'' he said. ``Now they're going nuts. It's definitely
a hassle, but we're going to go anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Karla Speed, a caterer from Dallas, and her husband got as far
as Miami International Airport on their way to Costa Rica to
celebrate their first wedding anniversary. After spending the night
in an airport hotel on Tuesday, they were hoping to get on a 6 p.m.
flight on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had planned a very expensive trip in a resort, and we got a
honeymoon suite booked after lots of trouble,'' she said. ``Now
it's all ruined. This has just been terrible. I'm breaking out in
hives.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Passengers were not the only ones inconvenienced. Businesses
that use American to ship goods around the globe had to make other
arrangements, often at higher cost. Hit especially hard were
shipments to Latin America, where American is by far the dominant
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The court order still leaves open the dispute over how American
will integrate Reno Air into its much larger operations. The
smaller carrier has been a source of irritation to the pilots at
American since it was founded in the early 1990s, plying routes
abandoned by American at a time it was suffering record losses.
</P>
<P>
   American laid off several hundred pilots because the routes were
cut and quickly began selling frequent-flier miles to Reno. The
union saw the move as an underhanded way for American to lower its
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Carty, the chairman and chief executive of AMR Corp.,
American's parent, said he thought he would eliminate the ill will
associated with Reno and shore up American's presence in the West
when he bought it.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots are demanding that American speed up the Reno
integration, begin paying pilots at both carriers as if the two
airlines were already merged and give those American pilots laid
off in the early 1990s credit for their time off the job.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides talked on Tuesday but made little progress, the
pilots said. They were supposed to talk again on Wednesday but met
in court instead. Although the judge's order bars pilots from
calling in sick in large numbers, it does not order them to be
enthusiastic and energetic employees.
</P>
<P>
   They can still upset American's operations by scrupulously
obeying work rules or refusing to volunteer for extra flying,
something on which the airline depends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is doubtful that voluntary overtime will return to
normal,'' Mayhew said, ``until there is a negotiated settlement.'' &QL;

STANFORD HITS A LOW SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD _ The way people are talking up here, you'd think the
topic was Cardinal (begin ital)football(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   Stanford remains the best basketball team in the Pac-10, one of
the best in the nation, a strong Final Four candidate and a
monstrous obstacle for UCLA (tonight) and USC (Saturday) in Maples
Pavilion. It has lost just four games, all to top-12 teams: North
Carolina, Maryland, Arizona and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Like Cal coach Ben Braun said, ``I don't know why everybody's
into this Stanford bashing.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Cardinal (19-4, 9-1) has clearly entered a
midseason lull. It's not functioning with the precision it showed
in Los Angeles a month ago. The proof is a slew of narrow victories
(Washington, Arizona State and Cal) and one stat: Stanford has
trailed by at least nine points in the first half of five
consecutive games. It may not be vulnerable, especially at Maples,
but it's as close to vulnerability as anyone would have imagined.
Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   Bad matchups: By quirk of scheduling, the Cardinal faced two of
its worst matchups (Arizona and Connecticut) in a one-week span.
The Wildcats and Huskies possess the one ingredient (quickness)
Stanford's chain-saw execution cannot counteract.
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue: Early-season injuries to reserve guards Mike McDonald
and Ryan Mendez have forced starters Arthur Lee and Kris Weems to
log unexpected minutes, and their production has suffered. The
slender Lee is shooting 37 percent from the field in conference
play; Weems, 42 percent. (In his last four games, Lee has made 9 of
38 field goals.) For a half-court team that does not generate many
easy baskets, perimeter shooting is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Free throws: The Cardinal offense is designed to get power
forward Mark Madsen scoring opportunities in the low post, and it
has. Faced with two choices _ foul Madsen or surrender layups _
opponents have wisely started fouling. Madsen is shooting 56.1
percent from the line and made 3 of 8 against Connecticut (the team
connected on 12 of their 24 free throws against the Huskies).
</P>
<P>
   Are the glitches cause for alarm? No. Mild concern? Probably.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit a lull about this time last year, too,'' Madsen said.
``Every team has its ups and downs.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Stanford recovered from its ``downs'' to reach the
Final Four. Don't be surprised if it does that again.
</P>
<P>
   The debate rages: Rarely have the stakes for a specific No. 1
seed been as high as they are this season, with Duke and
Connecticut jockeying for the top spot in the East.
</P>
<P>
   It's a chance for UConn to play first- and second-round games in
Boston's Fleet Center, a few hours from its campus in Storrs, and
play the regionals in the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, N.J., a
Big East city.
</P>
<P>
   The other first-round East site is Charlotte, N.C., near
you-know-where. In addition, the Blue Devils view the Meadowlands
as Cameron Indoor North, since it has been the launch pad for
several Final Fours.
</P>
<P>
   The East is the home region for the Big East and Atlantic Coast
Conference champions, so both teams have a legitimate claim. But
that's a guideline for balancing the brackets, not a requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Why won't the Blue Devils settle for the top seed in the South?
Check the regional site: Knoxville, Tenn. The last thing Duke wants
is to face Kentucky, a potential No. 2 seed, in the South finals in
Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy feet: Last week, St. Mary's announced 340-pound center
Brad Millard won't play this season, after all. Because of a series
of foot injuries and subsequent surgeries, Millard has played just
two games since his earth-moving matchup with Tim Duncan in the
first round of the 1997 NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But Millard has not disappeared from the NBA scouting screen. In
fact, he's considering applying for the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not ready totally, but he's (7-foot-3), and in one year
he'll definitely be ready,'' said Oregon coach Ernie Kent, formerly
of St. Mary's. ``Some teams will have to take that gamble. He has
great hands, he knows how to catch, and his footwork is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the Pac-10: Cal guard Ray ``Circus'' King is living down
his nickname and giving the rudderless Bears much-needed stability.
His emergence allows struggling senior Geno Carlisle to play his
natural position, wing guard. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State rookie coach Rob Evans, formerly of the SEC, on
the difference between the conferences: ``The SEC is very physical
and has very good athletes, but the Pac-10 has more skill players
who can do things with the basketball.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   The difference between second place and eighth place is
excruciatingly _ or joyously _ thin: Arizona has won five games by
a total of nine points and Oregon has lost six games by a total of
14 points. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Washington has won seven of eight and Hec Edmundson Pavilion is
becoming a hot spot: Gary Payton has front-row seats. Next year,
the Huskies will play in Payton's place, Key Arena, while Hec Ed
gets a facelift. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Arizona coach Lute Olson has used 10 starting lineups with his
young team, but he's got nothing on UCLA coach Steve Lavin, who has
used 15. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The latest Ratings Percentage Index rankings: 3. Stanford, 15.
UCLA, 16. Washington, 17. Arizona, 55. Oregon. Unless they
collapse, the Huskies are in the tournament. &QL;

TWENTIETH CENTURY EXPECTED TO REPORT SPIKE IN EARNINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. -- Twentieth Century Industries Inc.,
once pushed to the brink of insolvency by the 1994 Northridge
Earthquake, is expected to report a 60 percent increase in
quarterly earnings today led by strong gains in its automobile
business.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's ninth-largest publicly traded insurer is also
expected to post an 11.6 percent gain for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a consensus estimate of four analysts surveyed by First
Call Corp., Twentieth Century is expected to report net income of
37 cents per share for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared
with 23 cents a share in the year-earlier period. For all of 1998,
analysts expect the insurer to earn $1.53 per share, compared to
$1.37 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ric Hill, a spokesman for the company, declined to comment on
the estimates or to discuss the company's business over the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   While still generating lower revenues than before the 1994
Northridge Earthquake, when it was one of the state's largest home
insurers, Twentieth Century has boosted its margins since shifting
attention more squarely to auto insurance. In the first nine months
of 1998 it earned $106.22 million on sales of $652 million,
compared with $110.9 million net income for all of 1997. Today's
expected earnings would give the company income of $138.63 million
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The annual earnings report will be the first for Twentieth
Century under its new ownership by American International Group
Inc. AIG stepped in with much needed cash in 1994 after homeowner
claims stemming from the earthquake depleted Twentieth Century's
reserves. Building on the equity stake it was given in exchange for
the money, AIG accumulated enough extra stock to take a majority
position last fall, a move generally supported by investors.
</P>
<P>
   Twentieth Century is expected to report its results after the
close of trading today. The company's stock closed at $21.3125
Wednesday, up 31.25 cents. Twentieth Century shares started the
year at $23.1875.
</P>
<P>
   The company also announced Wednesday that it had started selling
policies in Nevada, Oregon and Washington.

SEAGRAM TO RETAIN INTERNATIONAL ARM OF POLYGRAM FILMED
ENTERTAINMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- Universal Studios announced Wednesday
it will launch its own foreign movie distribution arm by using the
international operations of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The move means Seagram Co., Universal's parent, has decided to
keep at least part of PFE rather than selling it. Seagram sold off
the PFE film library in two deals totaling $400 million, but has
not yet decided if it will sell PFE's domestic operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two months of extensive evaluation in determining the
most amount of value PFE brings to Universal, we have concluded
that retaining PolyGram's international operations provides the
strongest strategic advantage,'' Ron Meyer, president of Universal
Studios, said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   The move underscores the increasing importance of foreign
markets in the movie business. Foreign receipts amounted to $10.87
billion last year, or 60.8 percent of the worldwide box office.
Baskerville Communications has forecast that figure will hit $15.37
billion, or 65.6 percent, by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   PFE, which will retain its identity, distributes films directly
in nine countries and uses its London office for sales in the rest
of the world. Its top upcoming movies include ``Notting Hill'' with
Julia Roberts, ``The Green Mile'' with Tom Hanks and ``Being John
Malkovich'' with Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   PFE's international president, Stewart Till, will continue to
head the operation, which owns or has output deals with Working
Title, Dirty Hands, DNA Pictures and Revolution Films.
Additionally, Universal will continue to use UIP -- its joint
venture with Paramount and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer -- to distribute its
own films overseas. The UIP agreement expires in October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Seagram, which acquired PFE last year as part of its $10.4
billion buyout of music giant PolyGram NV, is also expected to
report quarterly earnings today with analysts forecasting profits
of 2 cents per share for its second quarter ended Dec. 31, compared
with 22 cents per share in the year-earlier period. The downturn is
due to feeble box office performance by ``Meet Joe Black'' and
``Babe: Pig in the City.''
</P>
<P>
   Seagram also announced in December that it would take a charge
of as much as $700 million for the cost of integrating PolyGram's
operations. Since then, 700 jobs have been cut at the combined
music operations and another 1,500 slots could disappear by the
time the restructuring is completed this summer.

<P>
   LONDON _ The box-office hit ``Shakespeare in Love'' Tuesday
guaranteed its place in film history when it garnered 13 Oscar
nominations, the highest number for a domestic movie.
</P>
<P>
   With the third-highest number of nominations in the Academy
Awards' 71-year history, it overshadows ``The English Patient,''
which two years ago received 12 nominations, and is only one short
of the record _ held jointly by ``All About Eve'' from 1950 and
last year's blockbuster, ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Elizabeth'' bagging a further seven nominations,
Britain's film industry is hoping for one of its most successful
years at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ceremony
on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   But the hoped-for triumph highlights once again the vexed
question of what, exactly, is a British film?
</P>
<P>
   All $25 million of the ``Shakespeare In Love'' budget came from
an American company, Miramax, the former independent company now
owned by Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Another ``British'' hit, ``Little Voice,'' with Brenda Blethyn
nominated for best supporting actress, was also financed by
Miramax.
</P>
<P>
   So in terms of money, both films could be classed as American.
For the Department of Culture this is an issue best avoided.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would rather not talk about what is, or what is not, a
British film,'' said a spokesman Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the department's actions speak more patriotically than
its words. It issues a quaintly titled ``Certificate of British
Nature Of A Film'' to films that the Government considers British
under the Films Act 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare In Love'' has a certificate, as do other British
Oscar nominees, such as ``Hilary and Jackie.''
</P>
<P>
   David Parfitt, the British producer of ``Shakespeare In Love,''
said: ``We are most definitely a British film. To get the
certificate we had to meet certain criteria as regards use of
labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the entire crew was British, from the carpenter to
the director, and so were all of the cast, bar three _ Gwyneth
Paltrow, Ben Afleck and Geoffrey Rush. All of the locations were in
the U.K., and of the $25 million, $20 million was spent in the
U.K.''
</P>
<P>
   Parfitt said many ``British'' films were financed from the U.S.
Of his own films, ``The Wings of the Dove'' (1997) was 100 percent
financed by Miramax, and ``The Madness of King George'' and ``Much
Ado About Nothing'' had the majority of their financing from the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not where the profits go,'' he said, ``it's the labor and
talent you use, and the locations. Concentrating on the finance can
be very misleading. When people say a film is British and financed
in the U.K., you will still get sales agents madly selling off the
rights to foreign distributors.'' &QL;

<P>
   AMMAN _ Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan knew the game of kings had
ended the moment his brother landed at Amman's Queen Alia airport
last month.
</P>
<P>
   There was a formal embrace from the man who had supposedly won
his battle with cancer. But King Hussein ignored Hassan's son
Rashid and then showed what he thought of his Crown Prince by
choosing to travel into the city not with Hassan _ his normal
routine _ but alongside Queen Noor. Hassan was left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The man who had waited 34 years to be king of Jordan was
stunned. For weeks, he had heard rumors that his days as crown
prince were numbered; a Lebanese newspaper suggested that King
Hussein believed his younger brother was plotting a coup.
</P>
<P>
   But the king had reassured Hassan only days earlier that he
intended to make him regent. Hassan's desperate, melodramatic
attempt to prove his good faith is already the talk of Amman.
</P>
<P>
   He presented himself before the king and _ according to
impeccable sources _ asked Hussein bluntly: ``How have I offended
you? Here is my gun. If I have been disloyal to you, please shoot
me _ but do not disgrace me.''
</P>
<P>
   The king ordered Hassan to take his gun back and reassured him
yet again.
</P>
<P>
   When a similar account appeared in the small Jordanian newspaper
``Al-Majed,'' its editor was accused of ``insulting the monarch.''
Jordan's authorities are sensitive to the slightest criticism of
the royal family, but in the days that have followed the king's
death it has been possible to put together an account of Crown
Prince Hassan's fall from grace.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the sequel to his astonishing gesture with the gun was
if anything even more striking.
</P>
<P>
   The king called Hassan to the royal palace at half past midnight
on Jan. 20 to present him with his letter of dismissal. A
photographer was waiting to snap Hassan handing over his insignia
to the new crown prince _ now King _ Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan returned to his car without time to read the document;
driving away, he turned on the radio only to hear the contents of
the unopened letter on the national news.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jordanians feel that the manner of his dismissal was
unnecessarily cruel.
</P>
<P>
   As Crown Prince, Hassan had been ordered by the king to handle
Jordan's development projects _ a role that inevitably brought him
into conflict with the government of prime minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti who is said to dislike Hassan personally.
</P>
<P>
   Premiers believed that Hassan trespassed on their prerogatives _
something he had no right to do since the right of succession is
the crown prince's only constitutional power.
</P>
<P>
   Even before King Hussein's brave, hopeless insistence on his
recovery on Jan. 19, the royal court had been awash with stories
that the monarch was turning against his brother.
</P>
<P>
   First, the name of Abdullah would be mooted, then that of
Hamzeh, his son by Queen Noor (a post he was awarded when Abdullah
became king).
</P>
<P>
   Hassan's concerns only increased when he realized the extent to
which his communications were being monitored; for years, he talked
half-jokingly to visitors about the taps on his phone.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, King Hussein was told that
Hassan had tried to fire the chief of staff of the army, that
Hassan's Pakistani-born wife Princess Sarvath had gone so far as to
change the carpets in the royal palace in anticipation of becoming
queen.
</P>
<P>
   The truth appears to be more prosaic.
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of more than (pounds sterling)3 million, King Hussein
had built a house for Field Marshal Abdul-Hafez Mureii-Kaabneh, a
very ugly but otherwise magnificent pile on top of a hill outside
Amman.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor had it that Walid bin Talal, a Saudi millionaire, wanted
to purchase the property for (pounds sterling)10 million but Crown
prince Hassan, after consultations with the king, told the Saudi
that the property belonged to the field marshal.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan's response _ which appears to have been in accordance
with the king's wishes _ nevertheless provoked the story that he
wanted to remove the field marshal. And the king was not amused.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the tale of the carpets. Hassan's home is a charming
building once owned by the former British ambassador, Sir Alec
Kirkbride, but last year the Crown Prince decided that after years
of neglect, the house should be refurbished, along with adjoining
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Sarvath, so it is said, wanted to change the decoration in both
house and office. And a new story, as unfair as it appears to be
untrue, went the rounds: that the princess was ``changing the royal
palace'' even before the sick king had died.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could make dangerous mistakes. Against the advice of
friends, he commiserated before parliament with the suffering of
Iraqi civilians under U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi government reacted angrily because it believed Hassan
had not given sufficient support to the regime while the king
reportedly complained that the crown prince had not been tough
enough on the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Sarvath was also widely believed to want to name her
son Rashid as crown prince when Hassan became king _ an idea that
would inevitably anger Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   Those around the princess advised her to forget the notion but
it seems that Hassan, too, continued to toy with the idea of naming
his own son crown prince once he gained the throne.
</P>
<P>
   In the first days of his own regency, Abdullah showed
considerable generosity to his deposed uncle. He greeted him warmly
and _ when Hassan offered to hand over control of the six academic
institutions he ran, the new king insisted that Hassan should
continue to administer the projects.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation in which the monarchy is the one unifying bond, it
is as well that the two men appear to get on well. More royal
shenanigans, and Jordanians will be wondering what kind of royal
family they have inherited. &QL;

<P>
   ARGENTIERE _ Michel, a soft-spoken man in his 30's, stood,
weeping between the enormous banks of snow in the village street.
``No one dreamed anything like this could happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These houses were in the safest possible zone for avalanches.
But what does anyone of us really know? When the mountain decides,
the mountain decides. There is nothing you can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lost people that I loved a great deal. Here, we have
all lost people that we loved a great deal. The whole village is
crying.'' He turned away, unable to say any more.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamonix valley was in a state of shock _ and fear _
Wednesday after a monumental avalanche crushed 18 chalets in the
hamlet of Montroc-le-Planet, at 4,600 feet in the Mont Blanc
massif, killing at least 10 people, including an entire local
family of five and an elderly couple and their four-year-old
granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Two other people were definitely known to be missing; 20 were
rescued, including two Americans and a 12-year-old boy, found under
several feet of snow and rubble. All the dead were French.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue work was continuing last night, with heavy digging and
lifting equipment but hope of finding further survivors had been
virtually lost. With temperatures falling to minus seven celsius,
the snow had packed too hard for hands or shovels to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   The 150-yard-wide, 18-feet-high tidal wave of snow crashed into
the valley bottom at an estimated 60 mph.
</P>
<P>
   It crossed a stream and one part swept on for 30 to 40 yards _
uphill _ to consume a group of chalets on the opposite slope. Hence
the sense of shock and fear among local people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lived here all my life and I have never heard of an
avalanche so powerful, so low down in the mountains, and I have
never heard of an avalanches capable of going uphill,'' said one
gendarme, resting in the village of Argentiere, less than two miles
away, after hours of digging in the packed snow and debris.
</P>
<P>
   Other buildings, some old and some new, some local homes and
some vacation chalets, were carried some 120 feet down the valley
by the remainder of the avalanche, which had been inactive for 90
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible. There is nothing left,'' said Jean-Louis
Verdier, assistant mayor of Chamonix, 10 miles from the disaster
scene. ``Everything was wiped away. Where the chalets should be,
there is a big hole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The chalet next to ours disappeared. It was pushed across the
road. There were blocks of cement everywhere... It was the
apocalypse,'' said Jean-Marie Pavy, 49, who was staying in a house
just outside the path of the avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old French boy was pulled from several feet of the
snow and rubble by rescuers working with sonic equipment and
sniffer dogs after being trapped for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   He was taken to hospital with extreme hypothermia and his
condition appeared desperate at first, but he was said to be
recovering strongly.
</P>
<P>
   This was the only real success of an arduous night for 200
rescue workers. After an initial flurry of rescues, all the victims
recovered were dead, including a local couple and their children
aged 11 to 13.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year-old girl found in the wreckage of a chalet near
the bodies of her grandparents seemed to be just alive but was
declared dead on arrival at a hospital in Chamonix.
</P>
<P>
   Gendarmes and firemen returning from the rescue scene Wednesday
said nothing could have been done to prevent the tragedy. The
highest level of avalanche alert had been given the day before, but
the homes in Montroc were not regarded as under threat.
</P>
<P>
   The chalets were in a ``white zone,'' regarded as almost
completely free of danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had six feet of snow in three days,'' one fireman said.
``No one can remember snowfalls like that. When you have that much
fresh snow, piling up on other unstable soft snow, anything can
happen.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The danger from avalanches in this part of the Alps has been
endlessly studied, plotted and tracked over the years; defenses
have been erected and buildings banned in the danger zones.
</P>
<P>
   The process is so old and so elaborate that each large,
avalanche site has a name, like the mountains themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The wall of snow which fell on the village of Montroc on Tuesday
was called the ``Avalanche des Pecleray.'' It was regarded as the
Alpine equivalent of an extinct volcano: it had not dislodged
itself and crashed down the mountain since 1908.
</P>
<P>
   The last serious avalanche incident of any kind in this area,
high in the valley of the Arve, on the shoulder of Mont Blanc, near
the French-Swiss border, was 21 years ago. An avalanche fell on the
village of Tour, next to Montroc, destroying two chalets and
killing five people.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists have predicted that _ partly because of the
disruption of weather patterns by global warming _ snowfalls in the
Alps will tend to be greater, and later in the season.
</P>
<P>
   This has certainly been the case this year, with falls of six
feet of snow in the Chamonix area since the weekend. If the pattern
continues, all the conventional wisdom about safe and dangerous
zones for avalanches will have to be torn up. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 900. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   There have been dozens of other avalanches in the French Alps in
the last two days, most occurring safely high in the mountains. But
three British vacationers were engulfed by a snow slide at Tignes
les Brevieres, 50 miles south of Chamonix. They were not deeply
buried and managed to scramble free.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers also resumed the search Wednesday for a 28-year-old
Briton who disappeared in an avalanche while skiing off-piste near
Courchevel. The man, who was not been named, is presumed to be
dead.
</P>
<P>
   French police and prosecutors have issued stern warnings and
threats once again this year that tough action will be taken
against skiers who ignore warnings of avalanche dangers and leave
the marked trails and recognized slopes.
</P>
<P>
   The avalanche at Montroc had no such obvious cause; and it was
all the more terrifying for that reason. &QL;

   LONDON _ Blood transfusions given routinely to tens of thousands
of critically ill patients may be killing them, doctors have found.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian researchers have found that giving extra blood, despite
its essential role in maintaining life, can cause more harm than
good in those who have been thought in greatest need of it.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected finding, from a study of more than 800 critically
ill patients, will deliver a serious blow to the idea of accident
victims being stretchered into hospital with a bag of life-giving
blood suspended above them.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had assumed that any means of boosting oxygen supply to
the body's tissues in those who were seriously ill would improve
their chances of survival.
</P>
<P>
   But the Canadian research shows that critically ill patients who
received more blood were up to twice as likely to die as those who
received less.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, an estimated 800,000 patients receive blood
transfusions each year, most after routine surgery, and demand for
blood is rising. Using less blood would also save costs and
conserve a scarce resource.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of a transfusion is to restore levels of hemoglobin, the
oxygen-carrying constituent of red blood cells. Normal levels of
hemoglobin range from 14 to 17 grams per deciliter.
</P>
<P>
   In the Canadian study, half of the 838 seriously unwell patients
were given enough blood to raise their hemoglobin over 10 grams per
deciliter, while the other half were restricted to only 7-9 grams
per deciliter, half the normal level.
</P>
<P>
   One third of the restricted group received no blood at all. On
average the restricted group received three units of blood (one and
a half liters) less than the unrestricted group _ but more of them
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Among patients under 55 and the less severely ill, those who
received less blood (or no blood at all) were half as likely to die
as those who received more.
</P>
<P>
   The only exceptions were patients with heart attacks and
unstable angina (chest pain).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Hebert and his colleagues from the University of Ottawa
say in the New England Journal of Medicine: ``Our findings indicate
that the use of a threshold...as low as 7 grams of hemoglobin per
deciliter...was at least as effective as and possibly superior to a
liberal transfusion strategy...in critically ill patients.''
</P>
<P>
   It is well-known that giving too much blood or other infusions
can cause heart attacks or water on the lungs because of the effort
required to pump the extra liquid around the body. But the
researchers found these factors could not explain the differences
they found.
</P>
<P>
   In a commentary on the findings, Wesley Ely and Gordon Bernard
of the Vanderbilt School of Medicine in Nashville, Tenn., say it is
difficult to explain the harm caused by liberal transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that a transfusion, like a transplant,
delivers a shock to the immune system. ``Harmless'' viruses in the
blood may also be implicated.
</P>
<P>
   They say more trials are needed to determine the best treatment
for critically ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``With such knowledge, more physicians will be able to adhere to
the dictum `first do no harm,' and we will have a surplus of blood
for transfusion rather than a shortage.'' &QL;

QUARTEY BRINGS DRAMA TO FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Ike Quartey is the first Oscar De La Hoya opponent
who isn't too old, too light, too short, too weak, too ravaged and
too limited in boxing skills.
</P>
<P>
   If fact, if you listen to what Quartey plans to do Saturday
evening to De La Hoya at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center, you fear for the
safety of the popular World Boxing Council welterweight champion
from East Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to break De La Hoya in half like he's a chicken,''
promises Quartey, the 29-year-old fighter from Accra, Ghana who
recently was stripped of his World Boxing Association welterweight
title. ``I'm definitely going to knock him out. The only way I
won't knock him out is if he runs the whole fight, which he might
try to do. But he won't be able to hide from me. I'm going to catch
up to him, and when I do I'm going to hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical pre-fight hyperbole from a 4 to 1 underdog trying to
establish his legitimacy?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   But Ike Quartey is unlike any person De La Hoya ever has met in
the ring. He is unlike over-the-hill setups like Julio Cesar Chavez
and Hector (Macho) Camacho. Unlike undersized foils like Genaro
Hernandez, Rafael Ruelas, James Leija and Jorge Paez. Unlike unfit
clowns like Patrick Charpentier, Darryl Tyson, Narciso Valenzuela
and so many others.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Quartey is the youngest offspring of a most
active father, who produced 28 children with four wives in a
stunning exhibition of virility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have 18 sisters and nine brothers,'' Quartey said during a
recent interview here at the Top Rank Gym. ``But when I was growing
up, there were only four of us living with our parents. A lot of my
brothers and sisters now live in England.''
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, Quartey hits just as hard as De La Hoya, is
as quick as De La Hoya, is as strong as De La Hoya, and has just as
an impressive record as De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Quartey does have a draw to mar his ledger it came in his
last start against Jose Luis Lopez on Oct. 17, 1997 but he has 29
knockouts among his 34 wins compared to 24 KOs among the undefeated
De La Hoya's 29 victories.
</P>
<P>
   And Ike Quartey, whose oldest brother, also named Ike Quartey,
won a silver medal in boxing at the 1960 Rome Olympics, will
solemnly tell you that he wasn't exactly in prime condition when he
fought Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a severe case of malaria and never should have got in
the ring that night against Lopez,'' said Quartey, who was knocked
down twice by Lopez late in the fight. ``I was terribly weak, had
absolutely no strength. I shouldn't have gone through with that
fight but I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there hasn't been a fighter in the history of the
sweet science who doesn't have some sort of excuse for a
disappointing showing.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey isn't an exception, although his longtime trainer, Dan
Odamtten, insists he was ailing badly against Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at the film of the fight, and you'll see how thin
and sick-looking Ike was,'' he said. ``It's amazing he was able to
fight as well as he did against Lopez. It shows just how tough Ike
is.''
</P>
<P>
   How tough is Ike Quartey?
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely the best fighter Oscar De La Hoya ever has met,''
said De La Hoya's promoter, Bob Arum, who has an option on Quartey
just in case he pulls an upset and a rematch is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey has knocked out some tough individuals during his
11-year career, including Crisanto Espana, Vincent Phillips and Oba
Carr.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the only way he can emerge victorious against De La
Hoya is to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way I'm going to get a decision if it goes to the
scorecards,'' Quartey said. ``Look, what the judges did to Pernell
Whitaker. I thought Whitaker beat De La Hoya, and the three Las
Vegas judges all had De La Hoya an easy winner. They cheated
Whitaker, and I'm sure they'll cheat me if they get the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonsense,'' Bob Arum said. ``The WBC is bringing in three
respected officials from out of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, two of the judges, Larry O'Connell and John Keene, are
from England, while another, Ken Mouta, is from Japan. The referee
will be Mitch Helpern.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the overwhelming feeling here is that Ike Quartey will
have to dispense a dominant performance to earn a decision against
De La Hoya, a proven box office magnet and now perhaps the most
glamorous figure in his mean profession.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are heavily against Quartey in this one, but they have
been against him ever since he was a kid growing up in the tough,
poverty-stricken Accra suburb of Bukom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place where Ike lived as a youngster is the poorest in all
of Ghana,'' Odamtten said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a day that went by when I was a kid that I didn't
get into a fight, and I usually won,'' Quartey said. ``And when I
didn't win, my dad would kick me out of the house and tell me not
to come back until I beat up the other guy. When I was 8 years old,
I even got into a fight with a guy who was 15. It was about that
time when my oldest brother started taking me to the gym, and I got
into boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ike Quartey is now a national hero in Ghana, and he can't walk
anywhere in that country without being mobbed.
</P>
<P>
   He is married with a son and daughter, and these days splits his
time between Ghana and America.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey said he has respect for Oscar De La Hoya, but he thinks
De La Hoya has been sheltered throughout his career and will suffer
culture shock from finally facing someone of equal skills and size.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Oscar fights me, I'll knock him out,'' Quartey said. ``If
he runs, he might survive.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, there is, at last, legitimate drama surrounding
an Oscar De La Hoya fight.

QUARTEY HAS REASON TO BE FRUSTRATED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MORALES  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a guy so soft-spoken you can barely hear him speak, Ike
Quartey has been popping off rather loudly the past few months.
Oscar De La Hoya has taken the brunt of Quartey's ire, but it's
deeper than that.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey, who will challenge De La Hoya for his WBC welterweight
title on Saturday in Las Vegas, had three potential super bouts
postponed or canceled last year. Plus, he was stripped of his WBA
title for failing to meet mandatory title conditions.
</P>
<P>
   When the year was finished, Quartey (34-0-1, 29 KOs) had lost
millions of potential dollars, and some serious stardom -- had he
won just two of those fights.
</P>
<P>
   So who can blame him for being crusty?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, look, obviously it has been frustrating for me as his
promoter,'' said Dino Duva, president of Main Events. ``But that
can't compare to what Ike's personally been through.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1998 Ike was scheduled in consecutive three-month spans to
fight Pernell Whitaker, Felix Trinidad and then Oscar De La Hoya.
Every one of those fights fell out. And none of it was due to Ike
pulling out of the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Duva said that Quartey's monetary losses ``can't even be
calculated.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Quartey been successful, Duva said the boxer ``would have
been the number one guy in the welterweight division. The money
would have been unlimited because in my mind Ike would have beat
them all.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Quartey has shown the wear of those lost opportunities with
his demeanor. With his voice a tad above a whisper, even with a
microphone, Quartey's words speak volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big, big disappointment,'' said Quartey, 29, of
Ghana, about 1998. ``Before, I was upset. But now I think I'm OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He seems more than OK. He appears determined to get all his
frustrations out on one opponent. Quartey has one of the best left
jabs in the game, but his nickname of ``Bazooka'' is for his
booming right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm focused on this fight,'' Quartey said. ``This fight with
Oscar. Everything I do is about Oscar now. I said I wanted to break
his bones because Oscar doesn't have any (guts) like a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to bring your (guts) to the table, like a man, to
prove that you are a true champion. I'll fight anybody, I don't
care who. I signed to fight Whitaker, Trinidad and Oscar and they
all pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to prove to the world that I'm the best in the
division. But Oscar doesn't have no (guts), that's why he pulled
out of the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Quartey refers to the cut eyelid De La Hoya said he suffered
during sparring in early November. It postponed this bout from its
original Nov. 21 date. That was bad enough. But then Quartey saw De
La Hoya at a news conference in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It was just 10 days after De La Hoya allegedly was cut when
Quartey noticed something that irked him more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him two weeks later at a press conference,'' Quartey
said. ``And, there was not any evidence of a cut.''
</P>
<P>
   So here De La Hoya sits, waiting to face a man who is
practically foaming at the mouth to get at him. Will Quartey be
rusty because he hasn't actually fought a real bout in 16 months?
</P>
<P>
   Forget it, Duva says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nineteen ninety-eight was the most frustrating and
disappointing of Ike's career,'' Duva said. ``He was really ready
to jump to the forefront of the welterweight division.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know what, it's not out of reach; it just got delayed.
People say, `Is Ike going to be ready?' My answer and Ike's answer
to you is, he's hungrier than ever. Putting it off for a few months
just made him more ready, more hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Quartey is hungry for a slice of Golden Boy. When
asked how it is to have 26 brothers and sisters, Quartey replied,
``Hey, let's not talk about that. Let's talk about Oscar.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Fate can be terribly cruel. Just after Boris Yeltsin
touched down in Moscow, returning from King Hussein's funeral, his
Ilyushin-96 presidential plane was in a collision.
</P>
<P>
   Its wing hit a jet carrying the Italian prime minister; reports
said later that Rome's man was taxiing ``contrary to
instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the damage was slight, it was the final humiliation in an
expedition that was fraught with risk from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ill and disoriented, Boris Yeltsin spent less than three
hours in Jordan before bolting home, leaving the world even more
convinced that his days are numbered.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian papers were derisive. ``Yeltsin did not make it to
the grave but was very close to it,'' said Moskovski Komsomolets.
</P>
<P>
   Why on earth did he go? His doctors warned against it. He was
not particularly close to the king, and was certainly less involved
in the Middle East than his prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov _ the
obvious choice as Russia's representative.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, his foreign ventures often produce disasters. No
Yeltsin obituary will omit his failure to disembark from his plane
in Ireland in 1994, or his inebriated attempts to conduct an
orchestra in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   As his physical and mental decline has steepened, these episodes
have become less comic than sad, and more frequent.
</P>
<P>
   In Sweden in late 1997, he caused astonishment by suggesting
that the Japanese and Germans had nuclear weapons; in Uzbekistan
last year, he almost keeled over in front of the TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, in Kazakhstan, he looked astonishingly ashen
_ a lost, drugged figure who seemed barely able to summon up the
mental strength to sign a document.
</P>
<P>
   It took him 25 seconds to complete his signature; then he
shuffled out, after mumbling angrily about the press telling lies.
</P>
<P>
   So: why did he go to the funeral? The answer is part personality
and part politics. It was the desperate act of a leader worried
about his diminished status on the world stage. It was also that of
a politician badly irked by evidence that another _ Primakov _ has
stealthily taken the reins of power.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin cares much about how history will view him.
Entwined deep within his complex character is a fear that he will
be remembered not as a world statesman, who _ in his winning,
rough-hewn way _ piloted an empire through the agony of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he fears being remembered as someone who failed to grow
much beyond his roots as a Siberian party boss, whose actions were
primarily determined by an instinct to survive _ just like other
former party apparatchiki who still control the power and perks
across many of Russia's regions.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he could have expected better. Reforms and
privatization (although appallingly corrupt) were staggering along.
The ruble was stable. Predictions of civil war and revolution had
proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin had returned to power in an election which, by
post-Soviet standards, was fairly clean (although there were
campaign finance violations and grossly biased media coverage).
</P>
<P>
   The war in Chechnya remained unforgiven by Russians, but in the
West _ which generally paid it far too little attention in the
first place _ it was quickly being forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   There was a chance that history would be generous, remembering
him as the defiant figure who bravely confronted hard-line coup
plotters in 1991 from the turret of a tank.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the best of these achievements are in ruins. Tens of
thousands of skilled, young, urban Russians, the beginnings of a
consumer middle class, are jobless. The ruble is worth a quarter of
its value in mid-1998; Russia has _ at least for the time being _
alienated the international financial community.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's misery is measured by a pulse of individual
tragedies: a pensioner who immolated himself on Red Square;
rampaging soldiers who slaughter their comrades and themselves with
amazing regularity; thieves who cut off the hair of bus passengers
to sell it; workers paid not in cash but in rolls of toilet paper
or canned food; countless children begging on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Or the three girls _ not one older than 14 _ who, after writing
a suicide note, on Monday hurled themselves to their deaths from an
eighth-story window. (Whatever their motives _ be they unrequited
love or a cult's influence _ this horror says much about the
alienation of youth, parenthood, and a derelict education system.)
</P>
<P>
   If you explore the wreckage, the charitably minded can still
find reasons to give credit to President Yeltsin. Today's Russians
can say and read what they like; and _ for the minority with the
money _ can travel freely.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the United States, the world's chief sermonizer
on human rights, Russia has suspended capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is overshadowed by larger problems. Boris Yeltsin is
hated at home _ three-quarters of his population want to see him
impeached _ and regarded with a mixture of pity and dismay abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In his twilight years, he can counter this only by resorting to
a tactic at which he used to be a maestro _ grand, unexpected
stunts.
</P>
<P>
   There was a trace of this in St. Petersburg last summer when he
appeared at the reburial of Nicholas II and his family. But, as the
King Hussein funeral fiasco in Jordan proved, his touch has
deserted him.
</P>
<P>
   He has acquired the air of an aging actor, long ago stripped of
the lead, who keeps blundering out of the wings in the hope of
stealing into a spotlight occupied by others. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (750-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 925) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Boris Yeltsin's presidency ended five months ago,
after he sacked his government (led by the 36-year-old Sergei
Kiriyenko) _ the second to go within a few months _ after it had
announced a default of foreign and domestic debts and abandoned the
battle to defend the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   His final demise came when the State Duma, the lower house,
rejected his nomination for prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin,
who had already done the job before _ dismally, in the eyes of most
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise candidate, Yevgeny Primakov, the foreign minister,
was ushered in, posing as a loyal servant who was too old (69, a
year older than Yeltsin) to have any greater ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Humiliated, the President retired to the shadows, in which he
has hidden for much of his second term, wrestling with illness.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Primakov has seized the initiative, steadily securing
the status of Russia's ``de facto'' leader. After a cautious start,
his presidential aspirations have grown more blatant.
</P>
<P>
   He has assiduously wooed the Duma's powerful Communists, and has
courted regional leaders, both key power bases. Allies from his
days as foreign intelligence chief have been planted in strategic
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   At his back stands a government that has little sympathy for the
Kremlin or its occupant, but plenty for Soviet methods.
</P>
<P>
   When Primakov first took over the prime minister's job, Yeltsin
appeared resigned to life in the twilight; his aides conceded that
he was no longer governing day to day but was working on
constitutional issues. His weekly radio addresses stopped, and his
staged appearances on TV grew rarer.
</P>
<P>
   But what he cannot have expected _ and clearly resents _ is the
manner in which Primakov has turned his firepower on the Kremlin
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has launched a campaign against the
oligarchic Boris Berezovsky, a friend of Yeltsin's influential
daughter Tatyana, a man who until recently could make or break a
government.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies _ affiliates of the oil conglomerate Sibneft, and
Aeroflot _ linked to the tycoon were raided by police amid
allegations that he was running a private intelligence-gathering
operation which spied on the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the president amused when Primakov went to parliament
flourishing a deal in which Yeltsin would get immunity from
prosecution in retirement and an end to the (largely symbolic)
impeachment proceedings against him in return for an agreement not
to dissolve the legislature or sack the government.
</P>
<P>
   The president rejected the offer with warnings that he was not
about to give away any of his constitutional powers.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Primakov has insisted that he has no desire for the
top job. But there is a sense, hard to pinpoint, but palpable, that
he is quietly being anointed as the heir to the Kremlin, as the
monolithic forces that shape the land _ the minerals monopolies,
the regional elite, the media _ gradually coalesce around him.
</P>
<P>
   A transfer of power, a murky process in which the ballot box
will play but a minor role, is under way. So much for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   This impression is underscored by most of the other likely
contenders for the Kremlin who _ for all their shrillness _ do not
seem ready to do battle.
</P>
<P>
   General Alexander Lebed, governor of Krasnoyarsk, is collapsing
beneath the weight of running a vast Siberian region. Russia's
democrats _ a much-abused term embracing Thatcherite economists,
liberal democrats and non-ideological super-rich with fortunes to
defend _ have proved incapable of unity, and are too widely
disliked to have a hope.
</P>
<P>
   It is questionable whether Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of the
Communists, and runner-up at the last election, really wants the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He runs the only nationwide political party, and can still
expect to muster the support of one in five Russian voters. Yet
true power could quickly shatter the coalition of Stalinists,
mouth-frothing nationalists and progressive socialists who stand
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Given the sums of money at stake in Russia, and the national
habit of settling scores with a Kalashnikov, his life would be at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   Only one man, the formidable mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov,
seems genuinely keen to compete for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, for now, Boris Yeltsin is tolerated. Critically, this
allows him to fulfill one of his goals, again with an eye to
history.
</P>
<P>
   By completing his term, he takes another step towards ensuring
that the constitution _ a document that he forced through in a
suspect 1993 referendum, and which is still widely ignored _
becomes law. It is an issue about which he really seems to care. &QL;

<P>
   For many months, Western TV crews have been on death watch in
Moscow, confined to the capital. For months, obituaries have been
ready in newspaper offices around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, though a political corpse, Boris Yeltsin is not dead yet.
He has been under assault from an array of conditions that would
floor many another, which _ if the Kremlin is to be believed _
include double pneumonia, bronchitis, heart trouble, a bleeding
ulcer, colds, flu and throat afflictions.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not impossible that he will follow the example of
another equally accomplished boozer, Winston Churchill, whose heart
and health caused his doctor concern from before the start of the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   He died at 91 _ a decade after his resignation in 1955, much of
which time was spent staring into a coal fire with a rug on his
knees.
</P>
<P>
   Sick though he is, Boris Yeltsin could stagger on for a while
yet. Certainly, his aides _ led now by a former KGB general _ are
trying to discourage those full-time mourners who have long been
wringing their hands at their boss's graveside.
</P>
<P>
   This week a senior Kremlin official said that there would be
more outings to France, Germany and _ perilously, given the
distance and conditions _ to Africa and Latin America, before his
term ends in mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Russians, fearful of more embarrassment, will pray that he stays
at home. &QL;

<P>
   SANTA BARBARA -- Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano will get a look
at newcomers Kevin Eastman and Tony Soto tonight in the first
exhibition of the season at 7:30 p.m. tonight against the Pacific
Coast semi-pro All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The game will be played in the stadium at Santa Barbara High
School.
</P>
<P>
   Soto, the 10th overall pick in Sunday's college draft from
Southern Methodist University, was named the Western Athletic
Conference player of the year this past fall.
</P>
<P>
   Eastman, the top pick in the supplemental draft, comes to L.A.
after two seasons with the A-League Nashville Metros. In 1997,
Eastman was named rookie of the year and this past season he was
named to the A-League all-star team.
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano says Eastman will start on the backline with Ezra
Hendrickson, Greg Vanney and Paul Caligiuri. Soto will join Danny
Pena at the top of the central defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get a feeling right away for where these guys are
at,'' Zambrano said. ``You really don't know how they will do until
you put them out there with the rest of the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Clint Mathis and Daniel Hernandez will start in the midfield for
Los Angeles while regular playmaker Mauricio Cienfuegos remains in
El Salvador until his contract dispute with Major League Soccer is
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Welton likely will start up front with Jose Vasquez.
</P>
<P>
   Cobi Jones arrived Sunday from Florida but will not start after
helping the U.S. National team defeat Germany, 3-0, in an
exhibition. Galaxy defender Robin Fraser played a big role with the
U.S. team as well, but he won't join the Galaxy until Monday. He is
getting married this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy has been training at Oxnard College's World Cup
training facility since Feb. 1. Today's match is the first of seven
exhibitions before its season opener, March 21, against Colorado at
the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of young players we need to evaluate,'' Zambrano
said. ``We pretty much have an idea at this point of who's going to
start and which roles certain guys will play.''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Fate can be terribly cruel. Just after Boris Yeltsin
touched down in Moscow, returning from King Hussein's funeral, his
Ilyushin-96 presidential plane was in a collision.
</P>
<P>
   Its wing hit a jet carrying the Italian prime minister; reports
said later that Rome's man was taxiing ``contrary to
instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the damage was slight, it was the final humiliation in an
expedition that was fraught with risk from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ill and disoriented, Boris Yeltsin spent less than three
hours in Jordan before bolting home, leaving the world even more
convinced that his days are numbered.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian papers were derisive. ``Yeltsin did not make it to
the grave but was very close to it,'' said Moskovski Komsomolets.
</P>
<P>
   Why on earth did he go? His doctors warned against it. He was
not particularly close to the king, and was certainly less involved
in the Middle East than his prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov _ the
obvious choice as Russia's representative.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, his foreign ventures often produce disasters. No
Yeltsin obituary will omit his failure to disembark from his plane
in Ireland in 1994, or his inebriated attempts to conduct an
orchestra in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   As his physical and mental decline has steepened, these episodes
have become less comic than sad, and more frequent.
</P>
<P>
   In Sweden in late 1997, he caused astonishment by suggesting
that the Japanese and Germans had nuclear weapons; in Uzbekistan
last year, he almost keeled over in front of the TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, in Kazakhstan, he looked astonishingly ashen
_ a lost, drugged figure who seemed barely able to summon up the
mental strength to sign a document.
</P>
<P>
   It took him 25 seconds to complete his signature; then he
shuffled out, after mumbling angrily about the press telling lies.
</P>
<P>
   So: why did he go to the funeral? The answer is part personality
and part politics. It was the desperate act of a leader worried
about his diminished status on the world stage. It was also that of
a politician badly irked by evidence that another _ Primakov _ has
stealthily taken the reins of power.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Yeltsin cares much about how history will view him.
Entwined deep within his complex character is a fear that he will
be remembered not as a world statesman, who _ in his winning,
rough-hewn way _ piloted an empire through the agony of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he fears being remembered as someone who failed to grow
much beyond his roots as a Siberian party boss, whose actions were
primarily determined by an instinct to survive _ just like other
former party apparatchiki who still control the power and perks
across many of Russia's regions.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, he could have expected better. Reforms and
privatization (although appallingly corrupt) were staggering along.
The ruble was stable. Predictions of civil war and revolution had
proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin had returned to power in an election which, by
post-Soviet standards, was fairly clean (although there were
campaign finance violations and grossly biased media coverage).
</P>
<P>
   The war in Chechnya remained unforgiven by Russians, but in the
West _ which generally paid it far too little attention in the
first place _ it was quickly being forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   There was a chance that history would be generous, remembering
him as the defiant figure who bravely confronted hard-line coup
plotters in 1991 from the turret of a tank.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the best of these achievements are in ruins. Tens of
thousands of skilled, young, urban Russians, the beginnings of a
consumer middle class, are jobless. The ruble is worth a quarter of
its value in mid-1998; Russia has _ at least for the time being _
alienated the international financial community.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's misery is measured by a pulse of individual
tragedies: a pensioner who immolated himself on Red Square;
rampaging soldiers who slaughter their comrades and themselves with
amazing regularity; thieves who cut off the hair of bus passengers
to sell it; workers paid not in cash but in rolls of toilet paper
or canned food; countless children begging on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Or the three girls _ not one older than 14 _ who, after writing
a suicide note, on Monday hurled themselves to their deaths from an
eighth-story window. (Whatever their motives _ be they unrequited
love or a cult's influence _ this horror says much about the
alienation of youth, parenthood, and a derelict education system.)
</P>
<P>
   If you explore the wreckage, the charitably minded can still
find reasons to give credit to President Yeltsin. Today's Russians
can say and read what they like; and _ for the minority with the
money _ can travel freely.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the United States, the world's chief sermonizer
on human rights, Russia has suspended capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is overshadowed by larger problems. Boris Yeltsin is
hated at home _ three-quarters of his population want to see him
impeached _ and regarded with a mixture of pity and dismay abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In his twilight years, he can counter this only by resorting to
a tactic at which he used to be a maestro _ grand, unexpected
stunts.
</P>
<P>
   There was a trace of this in St. Petersburg last summer when he
appeared at the reburial of Nicholas II and his family. But, as the
King Hussein funeral fiasco in Jordan proved, his touch has
deserted him.
</P>
<P>
   He has acquired the air of an aging actor, long ago stripped of
the lead, who keeps blundering out of the wings in the hope of
stealing into a spotlight occupied by others. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (750-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 925) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Boris Yeltsin's presidency ended five months ago,
after he sacked his government (led by the 36-year-old Sergei
Kiriyenko) _ the second to go within a few months _ after it had
announced a default of foreign and domestic debts and abandoned the
battle to defend the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   His final demise came when the State Duma, the lower house,
rejected his nomination for prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin,
who had already done the job before _ dismally, in the eyes of most
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise candidate, Yevgeny Primakov, the foreign minister,
was ushered in, posing as a loyal servant who was too old (69, a
year older than Yeltsin) to have any greater ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Humiliated, the President retired to the shadows, in which he
has hidden for much of his second term, wrestling with illness.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Primakov has seized the initiative, steadily securing
the status of Russia's ``de facto'' leader. After a cautious start,
his presidential aspirations have grown more blatant.
</P>
<P>
   He has assiduously wooed the Duma's powerful Communists, and has
courted regional leaders, both key power bases. Allies from his
days as foreign intelligence chief have been planted in strategic
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   At his back stands a government that has little sympathy for the
Kremlin or its occupant, but plenty for Soviet methods.
</P>
<P>
   When Primakov first took over the prime minister's job, Yeltsin
appeared resigned to life in the twilight; his aides conceded that
he was no longer governing day to day but was working on
constitutional issues. His weekly radio addresses stopped, and his
staged appearances on TV grew rarer.
</P>
<P>
   But what he cannot have expected _ and clearly resents _ is the
manner in which Primakov has turned his firepower on the Kremlin
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has launched a campaign against the
oligarchic Boris Berezovsky, a friend of Yeltsin's influential
daughter Tatyana, a man who until recently could make or break a
government.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies _ affiliates of the oil conglomerate Sibneft, and
Aeroflot _ linked to the tycoon were raided by police amid
allegations that he was running a private intelligence-gathering
operation which spied on the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the president amused when Primakov went to parliament
flourishing a deal in which Yeltsin would get immunity from
prosecution in retirement and an end to the (largely symbolic)
impeachment proceedings against him in return for an agreement not
to dissolve the legislature or sack the government.
</P>
<P>
   The president rejected the offer with warnings that he was not
about to give away any of his constitutional powers.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Primakov has insisted that he has no desire for the
top job. But there is a sense, hard to pinpoint, but palpable, that
he is quietly being anointed as the heir to the Kremlin, as the
monolithic forces that shape the land _ the minerals monopolies,
the regional elite, the media _ gradually coalesce around him.
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the greatest accomplishment of the Giuliani
administration is the precipitous drop in the city's crime rate,
its most glaring shortcoming may be the failure to cultivate a
trusting relationship with most of the city's black leaders. Now,
the best and the worst have melded into the Diallo case, presenting
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani again with that most delicate matter of race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Anger persists over last week's shooting death of an unarmed
African immigrant by four white police officers who riddled his
body and apartment-building vestibule with 41 bullets. On Monday,
the president of the NAACP attracted national notice by condemning
the shooting. On Tuesday, more than 1,000 people staged an angry
demonstration in lower Manhattan. Wednesday, the mother of Amadou
Diallo, the victim, heeded the advice of the Rev. Al Sharpton and
curtly rejected any assistance from the mayor while in the city to
retrieve her son's body.
</P>
<P>
   With every passing day, Giuliani struggles to bring a calmer
perspective to the tragedy, to convey convincingly the pain he says
he feels over this loss of life and compassion for the victim's
family. Several times he has imparted heartfelt thoughts, then felt
the need to defensively recite statistics showing that fatal police
shootings are less frequent in New York than in other large cities.
His recitation of statistics seems to linger longer than his words
of sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for the mayor's predicament, including
his decision to reserve most comment during the investigation of
the shooting. But the overriding factor, critics say, is rooted in
the earliest days of Giuliani's tenure: Unlike his predecessors,
the mayor never established a lasting rapport with many of the
city's black leaders, either personally or through emissaries. That
failure, coupled with various slights and arguments along the way,
now leaves him with no capital of trust from which to draw.
</P>
<P>
   This was the clear message at a press conference convened
Wednesday by C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president,
and attended by, among others, former Mayor Ed Koch, who had
troubles of his own with many black political and civic leaders
during his tenure. But rather than score the mayor, most of the
speakers pleaded with him to open the lines of communication.
</P>
<P>
   Being mayor ``requires a willingness to hear,'' Koch said. ``So
we're saying to the mayor: `Listen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fields agreed. ``I certainly am not blaming Mayor Giuliani
or Commissioner Safir for the tragedy that took place,'' she said,
referring to Police Commissioner Howard Safir. Nevertheless, she
said that the city ``must change the tone and move in a different
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani responded Wednesday night by impeaching the event's
credibility, noting that Koch is a persistent critic and saying
that Ms. Fields failed to acknowledge the Police Department's
accomplishments, including reduced crime in black neighborhoods. He
maintained that he has working relationships with other black
leaders and tends not to deal with ``highly partisan Democrats''
who he said strive for headlines rather than substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hold a press conference and attack me, attack the
police department and completely discredit everything that's been
done, and if you have somebody who is a persistent critic sitting
next to you,'' the mayor said, it suggests ``no real willingness to
work out a real solution. That happens in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the mayor said that he understood ``the frustration. I
can understand the anger. I can understand all of it and I feel
terrible that this happened as I have expressed on numerous
occasions.'' But he said ``that there's a tendency of some people
in our society to blame the police in broad strokes that is just as
vicious a prejudice as any other prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions about Guiliani's relations with
minorities, his aides listed a series of accomplishments _ from
crime reduction to job growth _ that they say have improved the
lives of everyone in the city, and offered a familiar and short
roster of ministers, business owners and neighborhood leaders who
are both black and willing to talk of their admiration for the
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But this gambit backfired. One of them, the Rev. Michel
Faulkner, said Wednesday that he met with Giuliani this week to
convey the emotion that the Diallo case has sparked in black
neighborhoods, and to suggest that the administration more
emphatically display empathy for communities jarred by the
shooting. But Faulkner said he left that meeting feeling
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of where we go from here, I really would hope the
mayor would understand the amount of tremendous pain that
communities of color are in over this incident,'' Faulkner said.
``If he does not, I really think this will be a permanent blight on
his administration.''
</P>
<P>
   From a purely political perspective, however, the Mayor _ who
harbors hopes of seeking higher office someday _ may take comfort
in remembering that the electorate has twice validated his
management style. In fact, he received more votes from black
residents in 1997 than he did when first elected in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment he took office in 1994, Giuliani's relationship
with various black leaders has been complicated, even
dysfunctional.  &UR;  &LR;  One of the mayor's first actions was to end the
practice that his predecessors had of having liaisons to the many
constituencies in the city, from gays and lesbians to Hispanics and
blacks. ``He didn't want to Balkanize the city,'' said his press
secretary, Colleen Roche.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. David Paterson and City Councilman Bill Perkins,
among other black Democrats, have contended that the decision in
fact Balkanized neighborhoods like Harlem, leaving them with no
access to the administration.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the tension is the Police Department, whose
members have given the mayor something to brag about _ crime
reduction _ even as they resent him for blocking their requests for
pay increases. There is the perception that the department's
get-tough policy has been largely directed at young black men.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the very ones who are being singled out are the ones who
are being saved'' by the crackdown on crime, said Kenneth T.
Jackson, a professor of history at Columbia University. ``If you
look at just who's alive and who's dead, it's saving the lives of
black men.''

<P>
   Symbolizing that fear of government was the Louima case of 1997,
in which a Haitian immigrant was brutalized inside a Brooklyn
police precinct. Giuliani immediately called for a task force to
explore community-police relations. But months after his
re-election, he ridiculed some of that task force's recommendations
with sarcasm that overshadowed that fact that he had set aside $15
million for sensitivity training for officers.
</P>
<P>
   That sarcasm, along with memories of the administration's
aggressive handling of the Million Youth March in Harlem last
summer, returned to haunt Giuliani when Diallo was killed in a
fusillade of police bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's challenge, according to Dr. James Forbes, pastor of
Riverside Church in Harlem, is to better convey a universal
message: ``Guess what. You all count.''

RULING BY APPEALS COURT THROWS FUTURE OF MIRANDA IN DOUBT

 (ATTN: Va., Ariz., Md., S.C., N.C. W.Va.)  (Eds: SUBS 21st graf to ADD explanation of Miranda ruling; Pickup
22nd graf, Supreme Court ...)

 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It sat there unused by prosecutors for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, a law passed by Congress in 1968 was dusted off
by a federal appeals court in Virginia and used to declare that
federal law enforcement officials need not follow one of the best
known Supreme Court decisions of this century, Miranda vs. Arizona,
under which criminal suspects are routinely read their rights
everywhere in America.
</P>
<P>
   From coast to coast Wednesday, prosecutors, defense lawyers and
legal experts said the ruling provided the most serious challenge
to the Miranda ruling since it was issued in 1966, and opened an
unexpected debate about one of this country's bedrock legal rules.
Over the last three decades, ``Miranda'' has become part of the
language and its ``you have the right'' warning is one the most
familiar incantations of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   The court in Richmond, Va., held on Monday that Congress
overruled the 1966 Miranda decision in the 1968 law that sought to
make it easier for federal prosecutors to use confessions that are
given willingly. The Justice Department has never enforced that law
and now argues that it was unconstitutional. But the court in
Richmond, which has a reputation as one of the most conservative in
the country, dismissed that position as political.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, we are a court of law and not politics,'' said
the opinion by a three judge panel in which one judge dissented.
The ruling came about not because of an argument made by the
government, but by private conservative organizations that filed
friend-of-the-court briefs.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the decision would almost certainly be
reviewed by the full 13-member 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
in Richmond, and could lead to a reconsideration by the Supreme
Court of its famous 1966 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sets the stage for a significant Supreme Court decision
revisiting the status of Miranda,'' said A.E. Dick Howard, a
professor of constitutional law at the University of Virginia.
``The case presents squarely what, 33 years later, we think of
Miranda.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1968 law, part of a crime control bill, said that a
confession ``shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily
given.'' Many legal scholars say that Congress meant to have
federal courts decide simply whether a confession was voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda's requirement that suspects be told their rights has
been interpreted to apply both to federal and state law enforcement
officials. But the 1968 law only applied to federal prosecutors. As
a result, the decision on Monday, if it stands, would apply only to
federal cases in the five states governed by the Richmond court:
Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   State law enforcement officials in those states and elsewhere
are unaffected by the ruling, and Miranda warnings are to remain
standard practice unless the Supreme Court retreats from its 1966
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the states governed by the Richmond court, it was
unclear Wednesday whether federal prosecutors would follow the
panel's ruling. A few federal prosecutors in those states tried in
recent years to advance the argument made by the court in its
Monday ruling. But those prosecutors were directed by Justice
Department officials in Washington to follow the Miranda decision
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials declined to comment on the case and it was
unclear whether they would direct federal prosecutors to disregard
the panel's decision while it is being appealed.
</P>
<P>
   The popular mythology is that many guilty people go free because
of the technical requirements of the Miranda decision. Academics
have disagreed for years, though, about whether statistics prove or
disprove that belief. Because the Miranda ruling was one of the
landmarks of liberal judicial attitudes that shaped much of the
country's law in recent decades, the reactions to Monday's decision
were shaped by political perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives generally applauded it as an overdue limitation on
what some of them saw as excesses in favor of defendants. Some
conservatives have long argued that the Supreme Court merely meant
to state guidelines in its Miranda decision, not to lay down a
constitutional rule that would have a substantial impact on the
system.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is important because Congress would likely not
have had the power to overrule the Miranda ruling in 1968 if it had
been viewed as having established new constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miranda was not a constitutional requirement,'' said Douglas
W. Kmiec, a conservative constitutional expert at Pepperdine
University Law School. ``It was instead a constitutional
suggestion.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberals and defense lawyers Wednesday said the Miranda ruling
did establish new constitutional rights that could not be revoked
by the Congress in 1968. The decision by the Richmond court, some
of them said, would roll back what they view as important progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a decision as a society that the ends don't justify
the means,'' said Larry S. Pozner, president of the National
Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ``This says, `Forget about
protecting the individual.' I think its very frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cole, an expert on criminal law at Georgetown University
Law Center said: ``The decision takes away from suspects in federal
cases the right to know their rights and it resurrects the inherent
coersion of the interrogation setting.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberals have long said that police powers were so intimidating
that it was often difficult to tell before the Miranda ruling
whether a confession was truly voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   The 1966 Miranda ruling said people in police custody should be
told they had the right to legal representation and that any
statements they made could be used against them. The Supreme Court
has repeatedly undercut the strength of its own Miranda ruling over
the years by saying in later decisions that Miranda warnings were
merely ``prophylactic'' and ``not themselves rights protected by
the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas have
suggested they might be sympathetic to the argument that the 1968
law overruled Miranda's application in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice Department has been unwilling to make the
argument challenging the Miranda decision. In part, legal experts
say, that has been because law enforcement officials have been
divided about whether it would be useful to do away with the
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   There are cases in which guilty people go free because their
confessions cannot be used. But some law enforcement officials have
also said the clear requirement to give a warning has been
incorporated into police work. Some prosecutors say the Miranda
rule benefits them because confessions are routinely admitted if it
is established that a suspect was read the statement of rights.
</P>
<P>
   But for some conservatives the Miranda ruling remains
philosophically troubling. For them, it was also troubling that
prosecutors declined to use the 1968 law even though its
application could have helped win convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The case decided on Monday involved a Maryland man, Charles T.
Dickerson, who confessed to a series of bank robberies. A district
court judge ruled that he confessed voluntarily but that he was not
read his rights until after he confessed. The district court ruled
the confession could not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Under directives from the Justice Department, local federal
prosecutors did not make the argument that Miranda had been
invalidated by the 1968 law. But two groups, the Washington Legal
Foundation and the Safe Streets Coalition, filed
friend-of-the-court briefs making those claims.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, R. Shawn Gunnarson, senior counsel at
the Washington Legal Foundation, acknowledged that his
organization, which he described as a conservative law and policy
group, had selected the 4th Circuit to test the legal issue partly
because of its reputation as a conservative court. ``The 4th
Circuit,'' he said, ``is a very careful Circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts said Wednesday that the panel's ruling was
weakened because the court did not fully consider both sides of the
argument. The panel's decision said the Justice Department at first
took no position and then argued that the 1968 law was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's decision, written by Judge Karen J. Williams, said
the Justice Department had been ``elevating politics over law'' by
prohibiting the local federal prosecutor from arguing that the 1968
law would have permitted Dickerson's confession to be admissible.
Williams was appointed by President George Bush. A federal district
judge sitting by designation, Jackson L. Kiser, appointed by
President Ronald Reagan, joined in the opinion.
</P>
<P>
   A judge appointed by President Clinton, M. Blane Michael,
dissented from the part of the decision dealing with the Miranda
case. He said he saw no evidence that seven consecutive
administrations since the enactment of the 1968 law were acting
because of politics.
</P>
<P>
   The dissent noted that Williams' ruling concluded that the
Miranda decision did not amount to a rule of constitutional rights.
``I don't know whether it is or not,'' Michael said, ``but before I
decide, I would want thoughtful lawyers on both sides to answer one
question for me. If Miranda is not a constitutional rule, why does
the Supreme Court continue to apply it in prosecutions arising in
state courts?''
</P>
<P>
   H. Richard Uviller, a professor of criminal law at Columbia Law
School, was one of several experts who said Wednesday that the
decision on Monday could force the courts to decide whether the
Miranda ruling created constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the familiar warnings were to fade from American
life, Uviller said, the effect of the Miranda ruling's broad
message protecting the rights of citizens would not quickly
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miranda,'' Uviller said, ``is part of a group if cases that
have shaped our historic view of ourselves. And I don't think any
decision will just wipe that away.''

 By JAMES SCHEMBARI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The owner of a tiny army-navy store on the fringe of
Times Square is locked in an unlikely legal battle over a piece of
history, claiming that he, and not 20th Century Fox or anyone else,
owns the name Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, James Korn, 45, the owner of Kaufman's Army &AMP;
Navy on West 42nd Street, the store with the Spanish-American War
cannons outside, says he has the trademark rights to put the name
on clothing. He has informed 20th Century Fox, the makers of the
blockbuster movie ``Titanic,'' that it owes him royalties for any
clothing it has sold bearing the name.
</P>
<P>
   Wild claims are made on Times Square street corners every day,
but Korn's is far from fantastic. He is a respected expert on
military furnishings and has supplied Broadway and Hollywood with
original clothing for major shows and movies. More important, he is
a Titanic buff who already owns the U.S. clothing trademarks for
the White Star Line, the defunct company that owned the Titanic,
and the company's logo, a white star on a red pennant.
</P>
<P>
   He also says he has used the name on clothing longer than anyone
else, a claim that is at the core of his trademark applications for
the rights to the names Titanic and RMS Titanic. His petition was
heard by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in Arlington, Va., in
December, and a ruling could come at any time. His lawyer says
those rights are potentially worth millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Korn's efforts have not gone unnoticed. RMS Titanic Inc., the
New York company that has been raising artifacts from the ship
since 1987, and 20th Century Fox insist they owe Korn nothing,
noting in correspondence and in legal papers that they have spent
millions on their respective Titanic franchises and don't feel they
should have to pay royalties to a New York merchant with a few
thousand dollars' worth of Titanic T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   The movie studio filed a competing trademark claim in June. And
the owners of RMS Titanic formally opposed Korn's petition in 1995,
not because they want the trademarks for themselves, but because
they say they don't think anyone should have them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is offensive for anyone to think they can own the name
Titanic,'' said George Tulloch, president of RMS Titanic. ``It
belongs to history.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Peacock, Korn's lawyer and sister-in-law, replied that
precedent was on their side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mayflower is a historical ship, too, but people have
trademarks on it for moving companies and hotels,'' she said.
``This case is fascinating because here is an object that was
abandoned in the ocean and now is being raised. As far as the
trademark goes, it was also abandoned many years ago and is now up
for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   The trademark office has received applications for the Titanic
name for years. But since the movie was released in December 1997,
it has been flooded with them. Of the 57 Titanic trademarks pending
or registered at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, 49 were
filed after the movie came out.
</P>
<P>
   People want the name for hotels, cosmetics and golf clubs. A
farm in California wants the name for iceberg lettuce. How about
the Titanic Restaurant and Buffet, or Titanic, the fragrance, or
Titanic beer?
</P>
<P>
   A musical group has the rights to Lady Ice &AMP; the Titanics. The
Carnival cruise ship company filed last spring, as did its
subsidiary, Cunard Line Limited, which once owned the White Star
Line.
</P>
<P>
   And 20th Century Fox, after several letters from Korn, filed
applications that cover just about everything: posters, stationery,
videos, Christmas tree decorations and, like Korn, clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the studio has accused Korn of trying to profit from
the film, Korn filed his application in April 1993, more than four
years before the movie was released. Of all the active Titanic
applications on file, Korn's is the oldest.
</P>
<P>
   He said he notified the movie studio, the salvage company and
Dodger Endemol Theatrical Productions, the producers of the musical
``Titanic,'' that they were infringing on his trademark claims, but
he said no one took him seriously. He also said RMS Titanic's
history argument was baloney.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they mean to say is that they missed the boat on the
trademarks,'' he said. ``Now, after the fact, they're saying if we
can't have them, we don't want anyone else to have them,'' a charge
RMS Titanic denied.
</P>
<P>
   Rochelle Dreyfuss, a professor at New York University School of
Law, said history was not an issue in trademark law. She said that
although the Olympics were thousands of years old, the U.S. Supreme
Court upheld the right of the U.S. Olympic Committee to trademark
the name in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trademarks allow you to take something out of the public
domain and make it your own,'' she said, citing the name John
Hancock and the names of presidents. ``It is not unusual to use
something historical.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Paul Fahrenkopf, a trademark administrator with the Patent and
Trademark Office, said simply, ``We're not aware of any historical
exception.''
</P>
<P>
   Korn's application did not come out of the blue. His store,
specializing in military surplus goods, was founded by his
grandfather in 1938 and has been on the same block of 42nd Street,
between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, since.
</P>
<P>
   Korn grew up playing in the store, took it over in 1984 and soon
became a sought-after expert. He can walk up to identical-looking
Navy pea coats and point to the fake just by its pockets. His store
has such a reputation for authenticity that Broadway and Hollywood
wardrobe departments come to him for costumes or hire him to track
down difficult items. Often, because what he has is so rare and
fragile, he only rents a garment to a customer, who then copies it.
</P>
<P>
   That's what he did with a British nurse's uniform from World War
II, which made its way to Italy for the movie ``The English
Patient.'' It was not used in the movie, but in the scene when the
actress Juliette Binoche cuts her hair while in her underwear,
she's wearing a Kaufman's bra. Korn also provided the prototype for
the flight suits that Tom Hanks and the other actors playing
astronauts wore in ``Apollo 13'' and the Vietnam-era uniforms,
helmets and boots for ``Born on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   Korn has been a Titanic fan since he saw the movie ``A Night to
Remember'' as a boy. He eventually merged his interest in the ship
with his business, producing a line of Titanic novelty clothing
with items bearing such words as ``Lookout,'' ``First Class'' and
``Maiden Voyage.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Korn wanted to expand his Titanic clothing line and
filed his trademark applications. Two years ago, after he learned
about the movie, he wrote to 20th Century Fox and James Cameron,
the director, offering his services. He told them that he held the
trademark registrations related to the Titanic and that he was
willing to negotiate licensing agreements. Cameron didn't respond,
but the studio did, pointing out to Korn that he didn't own all the
trademarks yet, that it wasn't going to enter into a licensing
agreement, and that, in essence, he should stop bothering them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't believe we needed to, and we still don't believe we
need to,'' said Steven Feldstein, a Fox spokesman. ``Everything we
are filing for is relative to our movie.''
</P>
<P>
   RMS Titanic took a different tack. Not only did it argue that
history could not be trademarked, it told the trademark court that
it had been there first. Under trademark law, the concept of
``first use'' is the foundation of any claim, and RMS Titanic said
it had come out with Titanic clothing marking its 1987 expedition,
the same year as Korn's ``first use.''
</P>
<P>
   But of the dozens of companies that want to trademark the name
Titanic for one thing or another, why is RMS Titanic challenging
only Korn's?
</P>
<P>
   ``He threatened to stop our exhibits if we didn't sell his
T-shirts,'' Tulloch said. ``We got this bizarre behavior, so we had
to take this position. You treat your neighbor as he treats you.''
</P>
<P>
   Korn contended that he has a ``legal obligation'' to defend the
trademark ``against all comers,'' but acknowledged how deeply
people feel about the Titanic tragedy. If he wins, he said, he will
increase the distribution of his clothing and expand the line, but
tastefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to give the name a good home,'' he said. ``It will be
safe with me.''

CALIFORNIA HOME SALES REACH RECORD LEVELS IN 1998
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- California's home sales and prices hit record
levels last year with price gains in the suburban Los Angeles
community of Tarzana among the top 10 statewide, a trade group
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Escrow closed last year on 628,260 existing, single-family
detached homes in California, a gain of 13.1 percent from 1997,
said the Los Angeles-based California Association of Realtors. That
topped the previous high of 604,950 homes sold in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the median price -- the point at which half the homes
sold for more and half for less -- gained 8 percent to $201,410.
That bested the previous high of $200,660 for all of 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Prices increased in 287 of 353 California cities and
communities, or 81.3 percent, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   In Tarzana, a small community in the San Fernando Valley
approximately 25 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles, the
median price soared 25.9 percent to $328,000, the ninth biggest
gain in the state. For the entire San Fernando Valley, prices
gained 15.3 percent to $177,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sales figures for individual communities were not available,
said Realtors spokesman Mark Giberson.
</P>
<P>
   Last year repeat buyers returned to the market, which fueled the
local price appreciation, said Jim Link, executive vice president
of the Southland Regional Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more expensive homes are selling and they weren't before.
The upper-end market was very strong in 1998. It was actually the
opposite in 1995 and 1996 and into 1997,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Market drivers were low interest rates, robust job growth and
strong consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
   However, with the market now at its peak, some cooling is in the
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Appleton-Young, the state Realtor group's vice president
and head economist, said statewide sales should probably decline
about 8 percent this year while prices keep trending up. But
Southern California will probably see some sales gains, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with an 8 percent drop statewide that would be the fourth
strongest year in years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a look at two Los Angeles-area markets:
</P>
<P>
   Prices in Los Angeles County gained 9 percent to $192,580 and
sales increased 12.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Prices in Ventura County gained 6.6 percent to $233,770 and
sales increased 18.3 percent.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fatal police shooting of Amadou Diallo has
provoked many emotions among New York City's officers. Some who
spoke Wednesday expressed pity for Diallo and his family. Others
said they were surprised by the number of bullets fired and
concerned over what the political fallout will be.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, they said they identified with the four
officers who fired 41 shots at Diallo, a 22-year-old street vendor
from Guinea, in the early hours of Feb. 4 as he stood in front of
his two-story apartment building in the Bronx with a pager and some
keys.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, you see a black shadow coming up, and you might
think it's a gun,'' said Officer Howard Kurz, who was standing
outside the Midtown North Precinct station house on West 54th
Street on Wednesday. ``I've been a cop for 19 years, worked all
over the city, and I'd never arm-chair quarterback what happens at
1 in the morning on a Bronx street.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with 17 officers in precincts from Harlem to
Brooklyn, officers said that they could imagine themselves right
there in that vestibule, making a mistake that could cost them
their jobs or lead to the death of an innocent civilian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for them,'' said Sgt. Robert Reehil, a
plainclothes officer also at Midtown North. ``Every day, their
names are in the paper. Their addresses are in the paper. Their
careers are in the paper.'' And every day on television, he said,
there is file footage of the officers walking out of their lawyer's
office.
</P>
<P>
   When he heard the news, Kurz said, he thought: ``Those guys are
in for a bad ride. They're in the Bronx. They're white cops. Their
families are going to be torn up.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers who were interviewed Wednesday struggled to
describe the uncertain world they confront at the beginning of each
shift, and the self-doubt that lingers long after the shift ends.
</P>
<P>
   One officer spoke of beginning to squeeze the trigger when he
mistook a portable music player for a gun. Another spoke of her
fear about whether the commands ``freeze'' or ``don't move'' were
even comprehensible to many people on the city streets, given the
array of languages spoken there.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the questions that come from officers' spouses,
parents and children. Reehil said that after the shooting, his wife
asked, ``How could someone shoot 41 rounds at one guy?'' Standing
outside the station house Wednesday, dressed in khakis and a
sweatshirt, he shrugged. ``I can't explain it. I wasn't there.''
But he said his views have been shaped by the fact his brother,
also a police officer, had been shot and wounded in the line of
duty.
</P>
<P>
   Yvette Matthews, also an officer at Midtown North, agreed with
Reehil, ``They ask us questions, as though we're supposed to know
the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers said any of the 30 to 40 calls on a typical shift could
explode into catastrophe. Such rapid-fire crises can leave officers
stricken by headaches, taut with fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ever see those kaleidoscopes when you were a kid?'' asked
Officer Ronald Fagan at the 84th Precinct station house on Tillary
Street in Brooklyn. ``That's what happens in your brain after a
shift and everything you saw and everything you didn't do flashes
through your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the career-ending mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Some white officers at the 84th Precinct in Brooklyn said they
often feel isolated and up against a wall as politicians exploit
the racial aspect of such cases and the news media piles on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more or less like we're political pawns for the public
and politicians,'' said one officer there with 17 years experience,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``In Nassau and Suffolk,
they back you up. Here, you're suspended for 30 days before you
even go to trial.''
</P>
<P>
   A minority officer at the precinct, who joined the conversation,
did not question the role of politicians but rather the number of
bullets fired.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan said that he thought the police brass were tough on
members of the force. ``I don't think that anyone will deny that
police officers have a profound lack of due process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the treacherous waters they navigate, some officers said
that they feel that vigilance, even fear, can be their closest
ally. ``Fear is survival,'' said Matthews of the 18th Precinct.
</P>
<P>
   But it can also lead to rash actions _ or no action at all.
Officer Kurz recalled the time he was at the Lefrak City apartment
complex in Queens and shots were being fired at him. He stood
there, terrified, and didn't even take out his gun, he said,
because he knew that the shots could have been coming from any one
of ``10,000 windows.''
</P>
<P>
   The reflections of these officers came the day after Diallo's
mother arrived from Guinea to reclaim her son's body and swooned
before the house where he was killed. There was little disagreement
among officers that the shooting was a tragedy _ a life lost, four
careers potentially ended and a police force placed under public
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether they were right or wrong,'' Reehil said, ``they killed
an unarmed man and they have to live with that for the rest of
their lives.''

FRATERNITY MURDER SUSPECT CALLED SMART BUT EXPLOSIVE 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOCKHART, Texas _ The man who committed suicide as he was being
sought as the prime suspect in the beating death of a San Marcos
college student was described Wednesday as highly intelligent, but
with an explosive temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a real bad temper that was seen even when he was a
kid,'' said a family friend who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``But I think he was smart enough to know how to control it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah Marshall Wilkerson, 21, shot himself once in the head
Tuesday under a tree in his father's yard in Northeast Texas. His
father told Van Zandt sheriff's deputies that his son frequently
went to that spot to think or cool off when he was upset.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson was being sought in the death of Nicholas George
Armstrong, a 21-year-old Southwest Texas State University junior
who was beaten early Sunday morning as he slept at a fraternity
house.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the evening, a fight erupted as four men were ejected
after crashing a party at the Tau Kappa Epsilon house. Witnesses
told police that Armstrong, a communications major from Baytown,
near Houston, was not involved in the fight, which was broken up by
police.
</P>
<P>
   A witness told police he later saw two of the intruders back at
the house shortly before Armstrong was found beaten at 3:15 a.m. He
died Monday at an Austin hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Wednesday that charges against the second man who
returned to the house are unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were told that one fraternity member saw
Wilkerson leave the house shortly after the murder. When the member
asked whether Wilkerson and his friend had returned to the
fraternity house to steal something, Wilkerson allegedly responded,
``We're not here to steal, we're here to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the type of comment that fits into the general frame
of mind of this individual,'' said San Marcos Police Chief Steve
Griffith. ``There was a great degree of anger involved here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson, an Eagle Scout who grew up in Lockhart with his
mother, was remembered Wednesday as an intelligent young man who
often found trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in and out of trouble all the time, but basically he
was a good kid,'' said Dana Garrett, owner of the Lockhart
Post-Register.
</P>
<P>
   As a youth, Wilkerson sold newspapers on street corners. After a
couple of years, he stuffed inserts into the Post-Register.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known him since he was about 12 or so,'' Garrett said.
``He was so smart; maybe too smart some would say.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson graduated from Lockhart High School in May 1996 and
attended SWTSU for one year. He worked as a plumber in Lockhart
after dropping out of college.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wilkerson had no felony convictions, he did have three
convictions, or deferred adjudications, for misdemeanors, including
one count of possession of marijuana and two counts of criminal
mischief.
</P>
<P>
   While a warrant charging him with murder was being prepared in
San Marcos, Wilkerson left the area Tuesday and drove 220 miles to
his father's rural residence north of Wills Point in Van Zandt
County.
</P>
<P>
   When his father, Gary Wilkerson, returned home from work about
4:30 p.m., his son's van was in the driveway but no one was in the
house. After a brief search, he found his son's body beside a large
oak tree about 100 yards behind the house.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Deputy Grady Tucker of the Van Zandt Sheriff's Department,
said the younger Wilkerson apparently had shot himself once in the
head with a 9 mm Colt pistol he had taken from his father's house.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said the San Marcos police had requested that the vehicle
Jeremiah Wilkerson was driving be impounded as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson's body was sent to the Dallas County Medical
Examiner's Office. While it appeared that he died of a single,
self-inflicted gunshot wound, Tucker said, the cause of death will
be determined by an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Wednesday afternoon with the young man who
apparently returned to the fraternity house with Wilkerson, San
Marcos police said the still unnamed individual was probably not
involved in the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the man, who unlike Wilkerson had never been
enrolled at the college, stayed outside while Wilkerson went inside
and struck Armstrong on the head three times with a metal rod about
one-half inch in diameter. ``Any one of the blows was fatal,''
Griffith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe there was any intention on the part of the
second young man to cause bodily injury,'' Griffith said. ``The
statements and evidence we have certainly do not point in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Though authorities believe the murder weapon might have been a
tire iron, nothing has been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Most fraternity members declined to discuss what transpired
Saturday night and early Sunday morning. But one member, Chris
Jones, said he recalls thinking that Wilkerson seemed out of place
among the somewhat preppie crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember seeing him, and I was like, `Man, I wonder who he
knows?''' said Jones, a senior who said he left the party a couple
of hours before the beating occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The party at the rambling two-story Tau Kappa Epsilon house was
held to celebrate the new pledge class, which included Armstrong.
Like most fraternity parties, it involved music, dancing and beer.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Armstrong had been drinking, and students with ties
to the fraternity said he passed out on a couch as the party broke
up.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the evening, Jones said he recalls ``a little
scuffle'' involving Wilkerson and that the party crasher and his
three friends were escorted out the door by several fraternity
members. ``All I know is that some guys were causing trouble and we
sent them out,'' he said. ``I was dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though university officials do not classify Armstrong's death as
a fraternity incident, they nonetheless seized the opportunity to
temporarily suspend all the campus fraternities. Their action was
also in response to an alcohol-poisoning incident involving another
student who was attending a fraternity party last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   James Studer, dean of student affairs, said the school's
fraternities have a checkered history of low academic performance,
poor treatment of women and general social irresponsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Visibly shaken by the Armstrong incident, many fraternity
members agreed that some sort of time out was in the students' best
interest. Most expressed deep remorse over the incident and
struggled to understand how two lives were lost in such a short
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's killed the whole school,'' said Colin Copeland, a Tau
Kappa Epsilon member and a senior. ``I think right now we just all
have to sit back for a while and reassess.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's funeral will be at 3 p.m. Thursday at Grace United
Methodist Church in Baytown.

TAPING ALLEGATIONS WON'T SLOW SENATE TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Republicans won't let the impeachment trial
be derailed by allegations that a U.S. intelligence agency may have
taped presidential telephone conversations in the Monica Lewinsky
affair, Sen. Jon Kyl said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to slow it down, stop it or affect it in any
way,'' Kyl, R-Ariz., said in an interview. ``If we had wanted to do
that, we would have sought to bring everything to a screeching halt
until we verified the information one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   `` The Arizona Republic'' and the ``Wall Street Journal''
reported Wednesday that information had been passed to independent
counsel Kenneth Starr that White House telephone conversations may
have been monitored by a U.S. intelligence agency. The
unsubstantiated allegations of the existence of such tapes ended up
in the hands of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who
forwarded the information to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Journal'' reported that Lott asked Starr to investigate
allegations of ``some type of communications-monitoring system
within the Defense Department or intelligence community (that)
might have picked up Mr. Clinton's telephone conversations in the
Monica Lewinsky matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyl said Senate Republicans, to preserve the integrity of the
trial, would resist stopping the proceedings while more is learned
about the possible new tapes. Among the many unanswered questions
are why an agency would record Clinton's conversations and, if any
tapes exist, whether they would shed more light on the two articles
of impeachment against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl said that the Senate Republican leadership faced risks no
matter what it decided to do about the sketchy information, first
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If tapes exist, ``and if there is something on them, then we're
going to catch hell for not having stopped the impeachment process
until the whole thing could be checked out,'' Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly added, ``We have done everything to keep the
impeachment process moving to a conclusion on Friday, with no
reference to this whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart was asked by a reporter
Wednesday whether there were recordings ``done not here at the
White House with any kind of built-in system'' but monitored in
some manner from outside the White House.

AFTER CHOPPY START, JIM AND SHELI ARE DOING SWELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JEREMY BAGOTT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ For nearly two years, one Kern County sailor's
love for a Ventura County woman left him sleepless in Bakersfield.
Not since Jack balanced Rose at the bow of a certain ill-fated
ocean liner has there been so much rapture on the open ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Santa Barbara Channel was the perfect place for a budding
romance,'' recalled Jim Harder. ``I would drive down to (Oxnard's)
Channel Islands Harbor from Bakersfield every Saturday on the
pretext of giving sailing lessons. But I was really there to see
(ITAL) her (END ITAL).
</P>
<P>
   ``After the lesson was over, we'd check out a sailboat and sail
till sunset.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``her'' was Sheli Fisher, and their saltwater soirees were
destined to blossom into an I-5 love affair to make the Grapevine
seem like an ant hill.
</P>
<P>
   There is something about the tides, the breakers and the salt
air that instills passion _ perhaps one of love's great mysteries _
and there is no better time to share such stories than around
Valentine's Day. And for all its stormy weather, true love will
eventually find safe harbor; it's the story of Jim and Sheli.
</P>
<P>
   After being introduced by a mutual friend, she said, ``I think
we clicked right away.''
</P>
<P>
   But their relationship didn't exactly commence in smooth
fashion; love was almost on the rocks, quite literally, before it
got started.
</P>
<P>
   The waves started rolling on their first sailing date in June
1997. Frenchy's Cove at Anacapa Island was the setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I wanted to impress this woman,'' Harder said. ``The
place you go is over to the (Channel) Islands. The circumstances
are idyllic. It's how California was before all the people came _ a
pristine, primordial place, nobody as far as the eye can see.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we get there, drop the anchor, open a bottle a wine and
relax in the late afternoon sunshine.''
</P>
<P>
   A memorable outing ... and how. When it was time to depart,
Harder showed Fisher how to get the engine started while he pulled
up the anchor. Just when Harder thinks he's pulled off the perfect
date, the wind comes up and the swells build.
</P>
<P>
   Before he knew it, Harder was crouched on the deckhouse,
clinging to the mast, with one hand on a winch handle and the other
on a halyard. He was struggling to get the mainsail up when a huge
wave hit the port bow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost go over the rail,'' he said. ``There I am, hanging by
a knee and an elbow a few inches from the water, trying to look
nonchalant, like nothing's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Harder's trial by wind, sea and humiliation was far from over.
During the 11-mile sail back to Channel Islands Harbor, they faced
40-knot winds and 8-foot swells.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were being bounced all over the place and couldn't hold a
course,'' Harder said. ``It got so bad that we just let the rudder
decide its own course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, 3 miles from shore, the wind eased and I was able to
regain the helm,'' he said. ``That was our first sailing experience
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Fisher went back to her job tending bar in Camarillo.
It was her boss, Doug Brown, who had served as matchmaker; Brown
had raced sailboats with Harder out of Oxnard's Offshore Islands
Sailing club and thought the two would hit it off because they were
both ``very easy-going.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harder was sure Fisher would never agree to go sailing with
him again. Yet when he asked her the next time, she didn't bat an
eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``(ITAL) That (END ITAL),'' Harder said, ``is when I knew it was
love.''
</P>
<P>
   Today they live in a stucco-and-redwood-trim home with a
shake-shingle roof in a suburb of Bakersfield, where Jim Harder
works for the Federal Bureau of Land Management. The two-year
courtship culminated in a large wedding at water's edge in Channel
Islands Harbor, whereupon Sheli took Jim's last name.
</P>
<P>
   When they do any serious coastal cruising these days, they head
to Willow's anchorage on the south side of Santa Cruz Island. It's
one of their favorite spots because of the secluded, unspoiled
beach and haystack rocks that rise like sentinels.
</P>
<P>
   The pitter-patter of small feet can be heard mornings at the
Harder household _ Sheba, his cat; and Samson, hers. The felines
haven't had much of a choice about the relationship. There's
definitely no love lost between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both very independent,'' said Jim. ``They hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the sacrifices true love exacts.

GROUP HOLDS SINGLES MIXERS ON THE SEA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   OXNARD, Calif. _ The open ocean can be a lonely place for a
boater in search of companionship.
</P>
<P>
   A sailor has a better chance at finding romance cruising the
produce aisle of a neighborhood Ralphs than cruising the coastal
waters.
</P>
<P>
   That's where groups like the Single Mariners of Marina del Rey
come in.
</P>
<P>
   The Single Mariners, which holds half-day sails twice a month,
has been around for 14 years and provide a chance for unattached
men and women with an interest in sailing to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Most are first-time sailors, newly single, outdoors-oriented and
looking for a hobby, said club organizer Alan Gornick.
</P>
<P>
   After a collegial presail breakfast at a nearby hotel,
participants choose the vessels they want to sail on. These are
large sailboats captained by _ who else? _ single skippers.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of sailing season, 50 or 60 single mariners in a
dozen or so sailboats leave the protected waters of Marina del Rey,
Gornick said. During the winter, the number tapers off to about 30
people and a half-dozen boats.
</P>
<P>
   After the vessels are back in their moorings, members hold a
wine-and-cheese social.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes people drop out because they've met someone; others
have stayed with it over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a core group of perhaps 35 to 40 people who are
consistently around,'' said Gornick.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer, the Single Mariners organizes seven
multiple-day cruises. Some go to Santa Catalina Island, where
dinghies are taken ashore for a beachside barbecue after the fleet
ties off.
</P>
<P>
   The success stories are numerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Couples have met through the club and literally sailed off
into the sunset together,'' Gornick said.
</P>
<P>
   There's Phil and Gunnel Seitz, who met through the club, dated
for three or four years, got married and now spend their time
sailing off Mexico together in their 40-foot craft. They reside
either in a slip in Marina del Rey or at anchor in some secluded
cove in Baja California.
</P>
<P>
   There's Steve and Lucie Lee, who, says Gornick, met in the club,
got married three years ago and are now live-aboards on a sloop
they recently bought.
</P>
<P>
   And love's labors were definitely not lost on Gail Wright and
Gary Strachn. Though the two have known each other since college
days, it took a single's sailing excursion to cement their bond.
Now they live in Long Beach and can be found aboard their 36-foot
boat on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Like many sailing couples, Wright and Strachn have weathered
nature's forces and are stronger for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably shouldn't have left the island that morning,''
Wright said of a recent San Pedro Channel crossing. ``By the time
they were at the halfway point, the seas had become confused with
very high waves and dangerous gusts. There were waves as high as
our mast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me aware of the strengths and weaknesses we both
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marina del Rey Single Mariners meet at 7 p.m. the first
Wednesday and third Thursday of each month at Pacific Mariners
Yacht Club, 13915 Panay Way, Marina del Rey. The cost is $7, which
includes a light buffet dinner. Day sails are scheduled on the
first Saturday and third Sunday of each month. For further details,
call (310) 289-3338.

$51 MILLION VERDICT AWARDED TO SMOKER IS BIGGEST OF ITS KIND
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: SUBS to UPDATE with punitive damages of $50 million being
awarded late Wednesday, largest judgment ever in smoking-related
lawsuit; Story has been added to The New York Times front page.)  (jw) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A state jury in San Francisco has awarded $51.5 million in
damages from the Philip Morris Cos. to a woman who says her
inoperable lung cancer was caused by more than 35 years of smoking
cigarettes, primarily Philip Morris's Marlboro brand.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment is by far the largest ever reached in a
smoking-related lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The verdicts _ $1.5 million in compensatory damages awarded on
Tuesday and $50 million in punitive damages awarded late Wednesday
_ resulted from the first cigarette lawsuit to reach a California
jury in more than a decade, following the 1997 repeal of a state
law that barred product liability suits by individuals against
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   And although the size of the judgment could be sharply reduced
on appeal, it signals that the cigarette companies may well have to
fight a brushfire of similar suits just as the industry was hoping
to put its legal troubles to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Defending themselves against thousands of suits brought by
individual smokers or their survivors _ particularly in California,
where juries lean to high damage awards _ would prove extremely
expensive for the companies. Indeed, analysts who were interviewed
about the verdict, which they described as stunning, said they
believed that its lure to prospective plaintiffs could bring a new
rush of litigation against cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give incredible new strength to claims against
tobacco companies,'' said Mary Aronson, president of Aronson
Washington Research, which follows tobacco litigation for
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict awarding the 53-year-old plaintiff, Patricia Henley,
$50 million in punitive damages _ more than three times the $15
million her lawyer had asked for _ was returned after the stock
market had closed Wednesday. But on the basis of just the $1.5
million in compensatory damages awarded late the day before, prices
of cigarette company stocks fell sharply. Philip Morris was off
$3.8125 a share, to close at $41.5625, and the RJR Nabisco Holdings
Corporation was down $1.375, closing at $27.3125.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel wonderful,'' Ms. Henley told The Associated Press after
the verdict Wednesday. ``This is a great day for the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Philip Morris said the company was expected to
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment was the third in the last three years in favor of
smokers who contended that cigarette makers had failed to warn them
adequately of smoking's hazards. The two other awards, both against
the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., were later overturned, and no
such verdict has ever survived appeal. Until Wednesday, the largest
such judgment was about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the $1.5 million awarded on Tuesday was
compensation for Ms. Henley's medical costs, pain and suffering. In
addition, her lawyer, Madelyn J. Chaber, asked the jurors to award
her $15 million to punish the company for the negligence and fraud
that was found in Tuesday's verdict. The jury responded with that
much, and then $35 million more.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henley, of Los Angeles, discovered last year that she had
inoperable lung cancer. Although lawyers for Philip Morris argued
that she had understood the risks of smoking, her suit said she had
smoked since she was a teen-ager, taking up the habit a few years
before government-required warning labels began appearing on
cigarette packages in 1966. The tobacco companies, she said, never
told smokers that addiction might leave them incapable of quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Until quite recently, though, Ms. Henley would have been
forbidden to bring her case. Under a 1987 tort reform law, product
liability suits against tobacco companies were prohibited in
California on the ground that the risks of smoking were universally
known. The law was repealed in 1997, around the time California
decided to file a claim against the tobacco industry in an effort
to recover smoking-related health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, California was one of 46 states that struck a
$206 billion deal with Philip Morris and the other major cigarette
makers settling all remaining lawsuits brought to recoup those
costs.

MOTHER OF SLAIN PEDDLER REFUSES MAYOR'S AID
</HEADLINE>
   (See also NY-SUSPECT-MAYOR) 
(nk) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The mother of an African street peddler, whose
killing by four police officers has led to angry protests over the
human cost of aggressive police behavior, has refused an offer of
financial help from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton said Wednesday that Kadiadou Diallo, whose
son Amadou was killed last Thursday, while unarmed, in a barrage of
41 bullets in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building,
declined the mayor's offer because she and her husband preferred to
accept help from relatives and other African immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to blow the mayor's bubble here, but they are not
preoccupied with the mayor,'' said Sharpton, who has taken a highly
visible role in protests over the shooting. ``They are preoccupied
with how they are going to deal with political injustice and how
they are going to bury someone who shouldn't be being buried.''
</P>
<P>
   While the victim's mother turned down the city's help in
transporting her son's body home to Guinea, a number of prominent
current and former city officials criticized the mayor and the
Police Department for what they termed an inadequate and
insensitive response to a shooting that remains unexplained. The
four police officers, part of an elite street crime unit that
patrols at night, have not yet been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields convened a news
conference that was attended by former Mayor Ed Koch and several
other community leaders. Calling for a change of tone by the mayor
and the Police Department, Ms. Fields said city officials should
create an atmosphere of respect after explosive incidents like the
Diallo shooting.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, another former mayor, David N. Dinkins,
described Giuliani's reaction to the shooting as ``woefully
inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This business of the police always are entitled to the benefit
of the doubt should not operate in every circumstance,'' Dinkins
said. ``Clearly, the facts of this put the burden on the cops to
come forward and explain. The mayor should be asking that
question.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Kweisi Mfume, president of the NAACP, joined
those who said the federal government had been too passive in
letting the Bronx district attorney direct the investigation. Mfume
spoke of his ``utter dismay'' at the Justice Department's decision
to monitor the investigation, rather than initiate one of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani told reporters Wednesday that while he understood the
anger and frustration in the city and felt ``terrible'' about the
shooting, he felt that it would not be fair to draw any ``systemic
conclusions'' from the incident. He also said that ``there is a
tendency of some people in our society to blame the police in broad
strokes that is just as vicious a prejudice as any other
prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Saikou Diallo, the victim's father, said on Wednesday night
after arriving at Kennedy International Airport on a flight from
Hong Kong that he hoped the four policemen who shot his son would
be arrested and ``judged fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope, yes, to get justice in America,'' said Diallo, who was
in Vietnam on business when his son was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office sent people to pick up Diallo at the airport,
but he chose to leave instead with Sharpton and Kyle Watters, a
lawyer representing the family. Earlier Wednesday, Mrs. Diallo
moved out of the Stanhope Hotel, where the city had offered to pay
her bill, and checked into another hotel.

THANK FALWELL FOR UNCOVERING TELEVISION'S PURPLE MENACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This story also moved in the ``e'' entertainment news 
 file)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barney, the purple dinosaur? Gay.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Rev. Jerry Falwell and his kinky Tinky Winky
theory for helping us with that.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell said this week that Tinky Winky, the TV Teletubby from
Itsy Bitsy Entertainment and PBS, is in all likelihood gay.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Like Barney, Tinky Winky is purple. Tinky Winky carries a
bag. Tinky Winky has a triangular antenna on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Purple, the gay pride color, is a pretty good tip-off. The
so-called magic bag? A purse, and you know what that means.
</P>
<P>
   But the triangular antenna is the clincher. A big gay pride
signal.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I see someone wearing a triangular antenna on his head,
the first thing I always think is: gay. Or at least very happy.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also thinking that Tinky Winky and Barney might even be
lovers, off camera. ``I love you, you love me. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Any chance that Laa-Laa is jealous, or is Laa-Laa enjoying a
little Dipsy on the side?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, thank God for the religious right for yet another
searing insight into television's sordid world of crummy Christian
role models.
</P>
<P>
   This is the best one since the Rev. Donald Wildmon woke up in
Tupelo, Miss., one morning in 1988 and saw Mighty Mouse snorting
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Wildmon _ and how _ was sure he saw it on ``Mighty Mouse: The
New Adventures'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   These revelations raise all sorts of questions. Like, does
Falwell ever miss a ``Teletubbies'' show? Also, since Wildmon is an
aficionado of Saturday morning cartoons, how does he rate ``Oggy
and the Cockroaches'' versus ``Space Goofs''?
</P>
<P>
   And just what is Oggy doing with those roaches, anyhow?
</P>
<P>
   There are also questions about what Falwell called ``subtle
depictions'' of gay lifestyles on American TV.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the Minnesota Vikings, who have lost four
Super Bowls and tanked in the conference championship game this
past season.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings wear purple, and there are horns on their helmets.
Gay. Not to mention the fact that their most famous quarterback was
named Fran.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Kung Fu,'' the protagonist wandered around the Old West
carrying a handbag and uttering cryptic comments about the oneness
of all things. Extremely gay.
</P>
<P>
   We have our long-standing suspicions about Dr. Smith of ``Lost
in Space.'' (set ital)(Danger, Will Robinson!)(end ital) How about
all that form-fitting lavender _ to say nothing of chartreuse _ on
the original ``Star Trek''? Don't you just know that Pinky Lee was
a Communist? (Oops, wrong topic.) Twist your color control just a
little bit, and ``Hill Street Blues'' becomes ``Hill Street
Purples.'' Lassie was a guy with a serious gender identity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   We have no idea how many characters in old black-and-white shows
were actually swathed in purple, secretly beaming insidious gay
rights messages.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Paladin, from ``Have Gun Will Travel.'' You thought he
dressed in black. But are you sure?
</P>
<P>
   My ``Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV
Shows'' notes that Paladin lived in San Francisco (set
ital)(hell-llo!)(end ital) and ``was a man of culture, enjoying the
finest clothes, epicurean meals, and literate company. ...'' Do we
need a bullhorn? Gay.
</P>
<P>
   It goes on and on. How about that clergyman, Jerry Falwell, you
sometimes see with purple vestments? Gay?
</P>
<P>
   Then there is NBC's ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' in which Will Truman plays
poker, lives with a beautiful woman, never wears purple, owns no
handbag and, as a general rule, steers clear of all triangular
headgear.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, straight.

COAST GUARD DECIDES TO BURN SHIP LEAKING OIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update with new 2nd graf. Rewrites original 5th graf,
beginning, ``Earlier Wednesday,...'' (mk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Faced with a cargo ship leaking oil, an approaching
Pacific storm packing 70-mph winds and the threat of an
environmental debacle along beaches in two states, Coast Guard
officials decided Wednesday to set fire to the 639-foot vessel,
which ran aground late last week about 150 yards off the coast of
southern Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Using remote-controlled grenades, the Coast Guard set off the
first detonation early Wednesday evening. Smoke billowed around the
ship, and officials said subsequent detonations would set off a
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are significantly concerned that this ship will not stay
together,'' Capt. Mike Hall of the Coast Guard said in a briefing
Wednesday on the decision to set fire to the ship. ``We're between
a rock and a hard spot. If we don't do something now, we would have
to stand before you and tell you why we let 400,000 gallons of oil
spill on our beaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Cracks in the hull of the ship, the Japanese-owned New Carissa,
which had been headed to the port town of Coos Bay to pick up a
load of wood chips, have already caused mucky black oil and diesel
fuel to wash over about eight miles of Oregon coastline, Coast
Guard officials said. That oil has come ashore near a prime habitat
for the Western snowy plover, an endangered shorebird.
</P>
<P>
   The storm expected to hit Wednesday night was carrying sharp
winds and rain, and the officials decided that there was a serious
risk that the vessel would simply break apart, which could send the
remaining oil onto beaches all along the Oregon coast and northward
along the Washington coast.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, U.S. Navy explosive experts boarded the
grounded ship and prepared the remote-controlled grenades. The
blaze was expected to last a few days.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to burn the ship in such circumstances is unusual
but not unprecedented, experts said Wednesday, and in essence
involves opting for a fire that will blacken and pollute the skies
in the area as the cost of trying to save the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any of these things, it's a trade-off,'' said Steven
Barnes, director of the National Spill Control School, a branch of
Texas A&AMP;M University in Corpus Christi, Texas. ``There's no real
technique that doesn't cause problems, but the assumption here
seems to be that the fire is less of a risk than letting that ship
sit there and be pounded to pieces in stormy seas.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups, while expressing dismay at the lack of
expanded safety regulations to prevent such spills in the first
place, said the decision to burn the ship appeared to be the proper
one under the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction is that this is a terrible solution to an
even more terrible problem,'' said Allen Hershkowitz, a senior
scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, a
Manhattan-based environmental group. ``This might be a sensible
last-resort option, but it really underscores the need for double
hulls and safer ships. Tragedies like this are, frankly, not
uncommon, but they are also avoidable.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting the ship afire is itself not without some risks. At
worst, the fire could undermine the ship's structural integrity,
causing it to split apart before the oil has burned off. But as of
Wednesday evening, Coast Guard officials said the ship was still
sufficiently intact, giving the fire option a high likelihood of
success.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's worst oil spill involving a ship, the March 1989
Exxon Valdez disaster, in which nearly 11 million gallons of oil
poured into Alaska's Prince William Sound, a similar approach was
considered. But storms had broken up the tanker and spread oil for
miles around, making the fire option unfeasible, Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon, the New Carissa ran aground in the Leberti Hole, a
major area for commercial crabbers, and was within sight of the
beaches north of Coos Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred members of a clean-up crew, most of them
volunteers, gathered along the beaches Wednesday, picking up
oil-coated driftwood and tar-like balls from the spill. Several
oil-coated birds have been found; it is not yet clear how many
wildlife deaths have been caused by the spill, a Coast Guard
spokeswoman in Seattle said.
</P>
<P>
   In opting for the fire, the authorities have abandoned an
earlier plan to try to pull the ship free and then tow it in for
repairs. After the oil has been burned off, the burned steel hull
of the ship is expected to be towed to the beach and cut up. The
23-man crew, mostly from the Philippines, was safely removed from
the ship last Friday and has been interviewed by the Coast Guard,
which is still trying to piece together exactly how the ship ran
aground.
</P>
<P>
   The fire plan ``is not a perfect solution,'' said Jacqueline
Savitz, director of the Coast Alliance, a conservation group based
in Washington, D.C., noting that it will likely destroy a wide
swath of fish and larval sea life near the ocean's surface.

GRUDZIELANEK DECISION DUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Perhaps the last piece of business in what was a
busy offseason for the Dodgers could come today.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Mark Grudzielanek, the lone Dodger involved in salary
arbitration, had his case heard Wednesday and a decision is
expected today.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek asked for $2.6 million and the Dodgers countered
with a $1.9 million offer for the upcoming season. Eligible for
arbitration for the first time, Grudzielanek made $350,000 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old is expected to battle with Jose Vizcaino for the
starting shortstop spot, unless general manager Kevin Malone can
pull the trigger on a trade before the season begins.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek hit .264 with two homers, 21 RBI and six doubles
after being acquired by the Dodgers from Montreal in a July 31
trade.
</P>
<P>
   With both clubs, Grudzielanek hit .272 with 21 doubles, a
career-high 10 homers, 62 RBI and scored 62 runs. He also committed
33 errors but has spent much of the offseason working on his
fielding.
</P>
<P>
   Owners won the first two arbitration cases, defeating Boston
outfielder Midre Cummings and Expos infielder Shane Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Uniform change: For the first time in 29 seasons the Dodgers
will brandish ``Los Angeles'' on their away jerseys, the club
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers wore ``Los Angeles'' on their road jerseys from
1958-70 before moving to the familiar ``Dodgers'' scripted across
the chest.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, each player and coach will wear a ``Dodger Heroes''
patch on their uniform sleeve as a way to pay homage to past
Dodgers greats.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Eric Karros selected a patch celebrating the
16-year career of former Brooklyn and Los Angeles first baseman Gil
Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad rooted for the Brooklyn Dodgers and he was a big Gil
Hodges fan,'' Karros said. ``It was a really easy decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Each player will choose a former Dodgers hero from a list
developed through fan balloting on the Dodgers' Web site last
month. &QL;

DISMISSAL SOUGHT BY 41-YEAR-OLD WHO ADMITTED KILLING MOTHER WHEN
SHE WAS 14 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A lawyer for Susan Marie Watson, the 41-year-old
woman who confessed this fall that when she was 14 she had killed
her mother, said in court Wednesday that he would move to have the
case dismissed on the ground that it would be impossible to pursue
juvenile murder charges against a woman nearing middle age.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watson, a data entry clerk and mother of three from
Schenectady, N.Y., was charged with murder under juvenile statutes
in October after she broke down in front of police investigators
here and admitted to fatally shooting her mother, Maylon Johnson,
in their home in Newark on Oct. 3, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   According to her confession, the police said, Ms. Watson shot
her mother in the chest because she scoffed when Ms. Watson told
her that she had been sexually abused by a man her mother was
dating.
</P>
<P>
   Though county prosecutors and legal experts alike have been
baffled by the task of prosecuting an adult under juvenile laws,
Ms. Watson's lawyer, Walter E. Florczak, said that such a
prosecution is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has jurisdiction in this case,'' Florczak said. ``The
law simply doesn't provide for a 41-year-old juvenile.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief hearing in Essex County Family Court, Florczak said
he would file a motion by March 4 to dismiss the case. After the
hearing, he added that he would contest the charges because the
juvenile criminal statutes in 1971 were largely meant to
rehabilitate youth offenders. Ms. Watson, who remains free on bail
and who, by all accounts, has lived a peaceful life in Schenectady
for nearly three decades, was already rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's had the same job for eight years,'' Florczak said. ``And
she's never been arrested except in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Weiss, a spokesman for the Essex County prosecutor's office,
said the county would challenge the dismissal but refused to say on
what grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts have also pointed to potential problems with
sentencing under 1971 juvenile laws. If Ms. Watson had been tried
as a juvenile and convicted at the time, sentencing guidelines
would likely have allowed her to be freed from custody at age 21.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watson's admission has also drawn attention because the
investigation into the death of her mother was reopened at the
urging of Ms. Watson's own brothers, George and David Johnson, who
did not know where the new trail would lead.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, the brothers, who were asleep in the
family home when the murder occurred, learned in October of a
special squad in the Newark Police Department dedicated to
investigating unsolved crimes and asked squad members to revisit
the case.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing Wednesday, George Johnson, now 35, said that
his family loyalties were split in two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love my sister,'' Johnson said. ``But I love my mother. I'm
torn between two loves now.''

RUSSIAN OFFICIALS PROFITED FROM SECRET ACCOUNT, EX-MINISTER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 - 1ST-LEAD-WRITETHRU  
 (Leads with comments from former finance minister)  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's former finance minister said Wednesday that
officials profited by spiriting out billions of dollars of
government currency reserves for management in a shadowy offshore
fund.
</P>
<P>
   The comments by the former minister, Boris Fyodorov, raised new
questions about Russia's financial creditability as it desperately
seeks international aid to climb out of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov's accusation followed detailed charges by Russia's
general prosecutor, Yury Skuratov, just before he resigned last
week, citing health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov said that after taking office in 1993, he began to
notice that Finance Ministry funds held in the Central Bank were
diminishing for reasons he could not understand. But when he
confronted the head of the Central Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko, he
got no answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told that . . . I was meddling in things that were not
my business,'' Fyodorov said at a press conference. ``In reality,
as I understand, friends were given a chance to make some money.
When billions of dollars are pumped through some company _ when
somebody gets a certain commission _ it turns out to be big in the
long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov, in a letter detailing the suspicious practices,
alleged that between 1993 and 1998, the Central Bank paid an
obscure offshore assets-management company to handle the money,
instead of managing it itself, as central banks usually do. Western
economists here call the practice unprecedented for a Central Bank,
which serves as the caretaker of a country's national wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov also accused Central Bank executives of illegal sales
of government property and of maintaining extravagant lifestyles at
state expense.
</P>
<P>
   In many places, such charges lodged by a top law-enforcement
official would set off a political firestorm. Outside Russia, the
allegations are bound to raise even more doubts about the wisdom of
granting Moscow's request for new loans.
</P>
<P>
   But inside Russia, where benefiting from government funds has
been a traditional path to upward mobility, the reaction had been
rather quiet until Fyodorov's outburst.
</P>
<P>
   Gerashchenko, the Central Bank chairman, earlier had confirmed
the practice, if not the sums involved. Gerashchenko said Russia
needed to hide its assets to avoid seizure by creditors owed
billions of dollars of Soviet-era debt that Russia has promised to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov responded Wednesday by declaring: ``This, definitely is
a completely strange system that has nothing in common with
international practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerashchenko said that in 1994 the Central Bank transferred $1.4
billion to the accounts of FIMACO, a company registered on the
Island of Jersey, off England.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, Russia was involved in difficult negotiations
with the creditors, and there was a probability that the country's
foreign property could be seized,'' Gerashchenko said in comments
reported by The Moscow Times. ``FIMACO was set up to avoid
complications.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Skuratov's letter, which was handed out to members
of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, the Central Bank
allowed FIMACO to handle $37.3 billion, 9.98 billion deutsche
marks, 379.9 billion yen, 11.98 billion French francs, and 862.6
million British pounds. This amounts to almost $50 billion at
current rates of exchange and, Skuratov said, and included funds
from multibillion-dollar loan packages from the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Western economists have been scratching their heads in
amazement. Eric Kraus, head of the fixed-incomes desk at Dresdner
Bank's Moscow office, called the allegations and Gerashchenko's
partial confirmation ``astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraus said he thought the $50 billion figure was ``doubtless
exaggerated,'' because the Central Bank ``never had that much to
manage.'' But he was left with more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who actually managed this money, and how was it invested, what
were the results, how much was charged for this service, to whom
did the profits go, and where is the money now?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows. Nor will they ever, if some Russian politicians
have their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong to launch a criminal proceeding only on the
basis of the transfer of money to this firm,'' remarked lawmaker
Georgy Luntovsky, who is chairman of the Duma committee that
oversees the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that nothing in Russian law prevents the Central
Bank from acting as it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing illegal about commercial activities by the
Central Bank that do not always coincide with the interests of the
state,'' said Georgy Bovt, political commentator for the liberal
daily Segodnya.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bovt said the government should investigate whether
anyone profited personally from the offshore investing of
government funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bovt and other analysts suggested that Skuratov's charges
stemmed from an investigation into the causes of Russia's financial
collapse last August, when the government devalued the ruble and
defaulted on $40 billion of domestic debt.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate privately debated for a second day
whether to remove President Clinton from office, Republican support
for conviction began cracking and an effort to censure the
President had virtually died.
</P>
<P>
   Three Republican moderates, Sens. James Jeffords of Vermont,
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and John Chafee of Rhode Island, said
they would oppose both the perjury and obstruction of justice
charges. Two more Republicans, Ted Stevens of Alaska and Slade
Gorton of Washington, said they would vote for obstruction but
against the perjury charge, all but assuring that the perjury
article would not receive a simple majority of 51 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords predicted that as many as six other Republicans would
vote against both charges, a forecast that if correct would mean
the article on obstruction could also fail to get a majority. With
the Senate split 55 Republicans to 45 Democrats, the 67 votes
required for conviction on either count have always been considered
out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   While other Republicans played down the amount of dissension,
Jeffords said he tried in his speech on the Senate floor on
Wednesday to persuade his Republican colleagues not to buckle to
pressure to convict the president. ``I wanted to assure some people
who were on the edge that it would be important to make sure that
we don't set a precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   At midday, after some Republican defections were known, Sen.
Trent Lott, the majority leader, issued a terse, cryptic statement
that did not announce how he would vote. With his aides insisting
that Lott was not trying to influence votes, the statement
acknowledged: ``The evidence shows that the president has committed
perjury and obstructed justice. The only question left is, will the
Senate vote to find him guilty of these high crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Lott said at another point on Wednesday that if
possible, the Senate would hold the final votes by 5 p.m. on
Thursday, a top Republican aide said on Wednesday night that it was
increasingly likely that the votes would be on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, about 50 senators had explained their views in the
well of the chamber, with Democrats more outspoken than
Republicans. A common Democratic theme was attacking Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel, and the House prosecutors, a refrain
senators repeated in the corridors and in news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, denounced the case as ``one of the most
blatant political vindictive actions taken by the House of
Representatives since Andrew Johnson's case was pushed through by
the radical Republicans of his time and forced upon the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's acquittal virtually certain, senators alloted 15
minutes each spoke to a chamber cleared of reporters and
spectators, offering their arguments in impassioned and prosaic
speeches why the president should be convicted and expelled, or
exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's session of six and a half hours, senators
delivered a stream of speeches, but rarely deliberated. Even Lott,
who favored closing the doors to encourage a give-and-take in the
first presidential impeachment trial in 131 years, conceded that
that had not happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point deliberations may break out, kind of like
smallpox,'' Lott said with a chuckle. ``If we have 100 speeches
without a lot of exchanges, that's OK, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators said those speeches were orderly, and the tone inside
the chamber was serious, even grave at times. Party warfare seemed
to abate. ``The sharp partisan divisions that are evident in open
debate are not nearly as evident behind closed doors,'' said Sen.
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., one of his party's fiercest partisans.
</P>
<P>
   Among those speaking were Sens. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, Conrad
Burns of Montana, Jim Bunning of Kentucky and Richard Shelby of
Alabama, all Republicans; and Sens. Patrick Leahy of Vermont,
Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, John Breaux of Louisiana, and
Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, all Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   As the impeachment deliberations meandered on behind closed
doors, supporters of rebuking Clinton virtually conceded that
Republican opposition, including a threatened filibuster, had
doomed their efforts to bring such a measure to the Senate floor
for a vote before a holiday recess begins this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Censure is on life support, gasping for breath,'' said Sen.
Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who favors censure.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said Democrats would push for a
test vote on a draft censure after the final impeachment votes. If
that motion fails to win the necessary 67 votes, she said she might
draft a statement condemning the president's behavior and circulate
it for senators to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has gone up and down,'' said Feinstein. ``We will
get enough signatures and sponsors to show that this is a serious
document. One way or another, this is going to see the light of
day.''
</P>
<P>
   While senators talked privately about censure among themselves,
several made announcements just off the floor. Just hours after
Lott implored senators on Wednesday morning to honor their oath of
secrecy and not make floor statements public before the final
votes, Harkin left the chamber to read to reporters the remarks he
planned to make later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing, as expected, that he would oppose both articles,
Harkin blasted the House prosecutors. ``Where the political
motivation is so blatant, as it has been in this case, I think we
in the Senate should have our guard up on what this case is
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Angered by what he viewed as Harkin's grandstanding and breaking
Senate rules on publicizing floor remarks, Lott rushed to
microphones off the Senate floor to criticize Harkin's comments as
``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkin's aides said the senator, a fierce critic of the closed
deliberations, had not violated Senate ethics rules. They cited a
memorandum from Lott's staff that said it was permissible for
senators to read their statements in public before delivering them
in closed session.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, a growing number of senators paraded before
the cameras or released statements altered slightly from the
comments they intended to give in the closed session.
</P>
<P>
   Specter, who handed out a 27-page statement, said the House
prosecutors were unfairly handicapped by the Senate's refusal to
hear testimony from any live witnesses. As a result, Specter,
citing Scottish law, said he will cast a vote of ``Not proven,''
instead of guilty, not guilty or present.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Harkin, most of the Senate Democrats who issued
statements on Wednesday criticized what they said was the
overzealous and politically motivated crusades by Starr and the
House prosecutors, who based their case on Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``They repeatedly rely on inferences while ignoring direct
testimony to the contrary,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. ``They
omit key materials which contradict their charges.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, perhaps the most anonymous
member of the Senate, lashed out at the House, saying, ``The
partisan nature of the House action invites challenges to its
legitimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   There was still some question Wednesday night as to whether any
Democrat would vote for either article. Sens. Robert C. Byrd of
West Virginia and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska have expressed deep
concern over the obstruction of justice accusations but have not
indicated how they will vote.
</P>
<P>
   Senators who say they will vote to convict Clinton on both
counts were less vocal on Wednesday. Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana,
a moderate Republican whose comments are usually measured, was
uncharacteristically acid in his assessment of the president: ``The
crimes committed here demonstrate that he is capable of lying
routinely whenever it is convenient. He is not trustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, the president's aides are debating whether
and how Clinton should react to the Senate votes. They are
considering several options, from a brief written statement to an
Oval Office address.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides are concerned about the tone that he would take
in a statement, since many senators have warned that they would
take a dim view of any gloating. No matter what the president says,
some aides said, he will be criticized as celebrating the outcome
of this 13-month ordeal.

UCLA'S LAVIN GUIDES `BABY BRUINS' 
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the youngest team in UCLA's storied history,
a collection of five freshmen, seven sophomores, a junior and a
senior. The coach, Steve Lavin, is a pup himself at age 34.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins have won 15 of their last 18 games, have put up a
17-5 record and have become the nation's ninth-ranked team. Lavin
has played 15 different starting units, and watched what often
resembles a kindergarten class off the court turn into hoops
prodigies on it.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Lavin will take his squad to Maples Pavilion,
decide at the last minute on a starting lineup and play No. 6
Stanford (19-4) and its lineup of seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are tough, they are unselfish,'' Lavin said of his baby
Bruins. ``They have high expectations of themselves individually,
and as a team. Sometimes we don't play with much intelligence _ we
reach, lunge, foul 3-point shooters. But everything this team has
done this season is within the realm of coaching basketball. It's
been a challenge, but that's why I got into this business.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach has faced no greater challenge than harnessing the
talent of the 6-foot-6-inch freshman JaRon Rush, a McDonald's
all-American who has been heralded as a Michael
Jordan-in-the-making by national basketball magazines since his
freshman year in high school at Pembroke Hill in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Rush was a star on the Amateur Athletic Union summer circuit and
the object of intense recruiting, a situation complicated by his
ties to a wealthy Kansas booster who financed a scholarship at his
private high school, treated him like a member of his own family
and was his benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   It was a foregone conclusion then that Rush would become a
Jayhawk until his mother, Glenda, refused to cosign an early letter
of intent for Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   She, along with Rush's grandmother, Jeanette Jacobs, wanted him
to get far away from the limelight in Kansas City. They got their
wish, but with unwanted national fanfare when Rush was widely
quoted as saying that Kansas coach Roy Williams ``substituted too
much.'' Williams indignantly rescinded the scholarship offer.
</P>
<P>
   Rush started the season strong, but didn't want to return from
Christmas break, saying he felt the pull of home and of his
14-month-old son, Shea. He missed two practices and a game against
Loyola-Marymount. When he finally showed, he was suspended for the
game with Arizona. Three weeks later, he tearfully refused to board
a connecting flight after the first leg was terrifyingly turbulent.
He had to be driven six hours to Louisville to be on time for
UCLA's game with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of pressure and a lot of advice given to me
since I was 15,'' Rush said. ``A lot of people want to tell me
what's best for me.''
</P>
<P>
   His coaches and teammates say it's immaturity, not arrogance,
that has tripped up Rush, who has averaged 10 points and 6 rebounds
a game and is one of the Bruins' hardest working defenders. The
players like him, and the coaches respect that he has admitted his
mistakes along the way. ``His growth has been slowed because of the
pampered environment at home,'' said the Bruins' assistant coach,
Michael Holton, who recruited him. ``Now he's learning to take the
bumps head-on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell him that he can let this stuff kill him, or be strong
and fight through it,'' said Earl Watson, a sophomore who has
started all 22 games this season and who is the Bruins'
second-leading scorer, averaging 13.5 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if Rush might have grown up last week against
Oregon, when he scored 17 points on 6-of-9 shooting to lead the
Bruins to a 79-77 victory. Then, two days later, he fooled around
during stretching exercises and was tossed from practice. He called
his grandmother, who told him to return to the gym. But Lavin
wouldn't let him back in, and benched him against Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the growing pains of UCLA's two foreign-born
players, Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric, have been far less
disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso, a 20-year-old freshman by way of the West Indies and
Paris, worries that he shoots too much, that despite being the
Bruins' third-leading scorer and most dependable inside player,
someone is going to realize he doesn't deserve his scholarship and
take it away.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric, a freshman who has just turned 21, is from The Hague
and had no idea who Bill Walton was despite continually reading
that he was UCLA's best center prospect since the big redhead.
</P>
<P>
   Both players have lost and regained starting jobs this season.
But Moiso especially requires gentle handling. Explosive and fluid,
the 6-10 power forward is so timid about demonstrating his
offensive skills that against Kentucky _ on his way to a 25-point
game _ he asked to sit so Gadzuric could get more shots. ``The
coach wants me to shoot the ball; every chance he gets, he tells me
to shoot the ball,'' said Moiso, who is averaging 12 points and 6
rebounds a game. ''But I'm not sure I'm good enough to shoot the
ball that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric, a bruising 6-10, 245-pounder, barely seems to notice
when he is in Lavin's doghouse. He didn't start against Oregon
State, too, because his coach didn't think he practiced hard enough
the day before.
</P>
<P>
   But the center thought it was because Lavin wanted him to rest _
he has been plagued by tendinitis in his right knee. ``It's been
frustrating with my knee,'' Gadzuric said, still not conceding
three days after the game that he didn't start because of a poor
practice effort. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lavin doesn't know how far his young team can go, or how
effective his efforts are to keep in line what he calls a
``high-maintenance'' bunch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In only his third year as a head coach, he says he is learning,
too. ``Every time you get two guys on the wagon, it seems like two
more fall off,'' he said. ``It's what you expect, but we're trying
to put in place today what's going to keep them all on board in the
future.'' &QL;

MAYOR OFFERS NEW STATISTICS IN DEFENSE OF POLICE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As other elected officials criticized the killing of
an unarmed immigrant by four police officers, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani defended the Police Department on Wednesday with a fresh
batch of statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani used graphs to show that city police officers fired 856
shots in 1998, down from 1,040 shots in 1997. The number of fatal
shootings by police officers last year _ 19 _ was the lowest since
1985, a ``remarkable'' fact given that arrests have risen
dramatically, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics were part of the Mayor's Management Report, a
self-evaluation that the City Charter requires to be published
every six months. Its presentation came as public protest persisted
about the fatal shooting of the West African immigrant, Amadou
Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Although Giuliani said little Wednesday about the shooting, he
spent an unusual amount of time on police statistics before moving
on to other parts of the report.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said that police in Boston, Washington and Chicago
fire their weapons more frequently than officers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the impressions that's given by those who have a hard
time giving the police credit for anything is that safety in the
city is brought about by the Police Department becoming more
violent,'' he said. ``Just the opposite is the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the news about the Police Department was good: the
police are taking longer to respond to calls about crimes in
progress, especially in Brooklyn, the report said. The average
citywide response time was 10.5 minutes, up from 10 minutes in
1997. In Brooklyn, the average response time rose to 10.9 minutes,
from 10.1 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an area where the Police Department has to do more
work, to find out why, and how that can be reduced,'' Giuliani
said.

RUSSIAN OFFICIALS PROFITED FROM SECRET ACCOUNT, EX-MINISTER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Leads with comments from former finance minister)  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's former finance minister said Wednesday that
officials profited by spiriting out billions of dollars of
government currency reserves for management in a shadowy offshore
fund.
</P>
<P>
   The comments by the former minister, Boris Fyodorov, raised new
questions about Russia's financial creditability as it desperately
seeks international aid to climb out of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov's accusation followed detailed charges by Russia's
general prosecutor, Yury Skuratov, just before he resigned last
week, citing health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov said that after taking office in 1993, he began to
notice that Finance Ministry funds held in the Central Bank were
diminishing for reasons he could not understand. But when he
confronted the head of the Central Bank, Viktor Gerashchenko, he
got no answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told that . . . I was meddling in things that were not
my business,'' Fyodorov said at a press conference. ``In reality,
as I understand, friends were given a chance to make some money.
When billions of dollars are pumped through some company _ when
somebody gets a certain commission _ it turns out to be big in the
long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov, in a letter detailing the suspicious practices,
alleged that between 1993 and 1998, the Central Bank paid an
obscure offshore assets-management company to handle the money,
instead of managing it itself, as central banks usually do. Western
economists here call the practice unprecedented for a Central Bank,
which serves as the caretaker of a country's national wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov also accused Central Bank executives of illegal sales
of government property and of maintaining extravagant lifestyles at
state expense.
</P>
<P>
   In many places, such charges lodged by a top law-enforcement
official would set off a political firestorm. Outside Russia, the
allegations are bound to raise even more doubts about the wisdom of
granting Moscow's request for new loans.
</P>
<P>
   But inside Russia, where benefiting from government funds has
been a traditional path to upward mobility, the reaction had been
rather quiet until Fyodorov's outburst.
</P>
<P>
   Gerashchenko, the Central Bank chairman, earlier had confirmed
the practice, if not the sums involved. Gerashchenko said Russia
needed to hide its assets to avoid seizure by creditors owed
billions of dollars of Soviet-era debt that Russia has promised to
pay.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov responded Wednesday by declaring: ``This, definitely is
a completely strange system that has nothing in common with
international practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerashchenko said that in 1994 the Central Bank transferred $1.4
billion to the accounts of FIMACO, a company registered on the
Island of Jersey, off England.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, Russia was involved in difficult negotiations
with the creditors, and there was a probability that the country's
foreign property could be seized,'' Gerashchenko said in comments
reported by The Moscow Times. ``FIMACO was set up to avoid
complications.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Skuratov's letter, which was handed out to members
of the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, the Central Bank
allowed FIMACO to handle $37.3 billion, 9.98 billion deutsche
marks, 379.9 billion yen, 11.98 billion French francs, and 862.6
million British pounds. This amounts to almost $50 billion at
current rates of exchange and, Skuratov said, and included funds
from multibillion-dollar loan packages from the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Western economists have been scratching their heads in
amazement. Eric Kraus, head of the fixed-incomes desk at Dresdner
Bank's Moscow office, called the allegations and Gerashchenko's
partial confirmation ``astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraus said he thought the $50 billion figure was ``doubtless
exaggerated,'' because the Central Bank ``never had that much to
manage.'' But he was left with more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who actually managed this money, and how was it invested, what
were the results, how much was charged for this service, to whom
did the profits go, and where is the money now?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows. Nor will they ever, if some Russian politicians
have their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong to launch a criminal proceeding only on the
basis of the transfer of money to this firm,'' remarked lawmaker
Georgy Luntovsky, who is chairman of the Duma committee that
oversees the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that nothing in Russian law prevents the Central
Bank from acting as it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing illegal about commercial activities by the
Central Bank that do not always coincide with the interests of the
state,'' said Georgy Bovt, political commentator for the liberal
daily Segodnya.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bovt said the government should investigate whether
anyone profited personally from the offshore investing of
government funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bovt and other analysts suggested that Skuratov's charges
stemmed from an investigation into the causes of Russia's financial
collapse last August, when the government devalued the ruble and
defaulted on $40 billion of domestic debt.

RENO PILOTS LOCKED IN DISPUTE OVER SENIORITY AT AMERICAN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.)   (See related stories: AMR-PILOTS and VACATION-TRAVEL) 
(jw) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. _ To hear American Airlines pilots tell it, they
called in sick and disrupted the airline's operations in order to
quickly raise the salaries of Reno Air pilots to American's level.
</P>
<P>
   But the pilots at Reno, which was acquired by American in
December, are not entirely grateful. Indeed, the Reno Air pilots
are locked in a sometimes bitter, though less publicized, dispute
with the American pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Many Reno pilots support the American pilots in their labor
dispute, which appeared to have ended at least temporarily
Wednesday, though they are not participating themselves. And they
will welcome the higher salaries that being an American employee
will bring.
</P>
<P>
   But they object to the proposal by American Air pilots to
``staple'' the roughly 300 Reno pilots to the bottom seniority list
of American's more than 9,000 pilots, as if the Reno pilots were
all freshly hired on Dec. 23, 1998, the day American acquired the
airline. Some Reno pilots are putting ``no stapler'' stickers on
their luggage, showing a stapler inside the red circle with a slash
through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not have all our years of service and the quality of
life that represents ripped away from us,'' said Bob Collins, a
Reno Air pilot who is also a spokesman for the local branch of the
Air Line Pilots Association, the airline's current union. ``Many of
us are in the last years of our career here and we shouldn't be
treated as new hires.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno senior pilots make an average of $65,000 to $75,000 a year,
less than half that of American pilots with equivalent experience.
Although American, a unit of the AMR Corp., has proposed raising
the salaries of the Reno pilots to its own pilots' levels in 12
months to 18 months, the American pilots' union wants those
salaries raised now.
</P>
<P>
   But for most Reno pilots, their salaries will not double because
they will have less seniority at American. Captains at Reno will
become second-ranking first officers or even third-ranking flight
engineers, posts that carry lower pay than captains. Collins, a
captain, for instance, expects his salary to climb to $100,000 a
year from $75,000. Lower seniority also means poorer choices of
flights, vacations and home bases, meaning many Reno pilots will
have to move from this city.
</P>
<P>
   Collins also complained that his union had not been able to
participate in discussions between American and the Allied Pilots
Association, the union that now represented the American pilots and
that would represent the Reno pilots. ``Allied Pilots have
basically closed the door on us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Engelke, a first officer at American Airlines, said the
issue of seniority was ``under negotiation.'' He said the union's
proposal was that the Reno pilots' length of service would count
toward their pay and benefits, although not toward their seniority
ranking.
</P>
<P>
   But some American pilots apparently think the Reno pilots are
ingrates, in that Reno might have gone out of existence if American
had not bought it. ``We're going to give you a raise, keep your job
and you're asking for the moon,'' said an anonymous phone call left
on the Reno union's voice mail, one of several obscene and
harassing phone calls the union says it has received.
</P>
<P>
   The disruption in air traffic spurred by the acquisition of Reno
Air is just the latest chapter in the history of the small low-cost
airline, which struggled for most of its seven years. Indeed,
judging by the disruptions this week, Reno has had a bigger impact
on air travel now than ever. Started in 1992 with one leased plane
and 150 employees, Reno has expanded to 25 planes and 2,000
employees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We accepted lower salaries to get the airline off the
ground,'' said Richard Vitzthum, a 47-year-old Reno captain who was
the sixth pilot hired.
</P>
<P>
   He said Reno promised that pilot salaries would be raised once
the airline became profitable. But for the most part, it was
plagued by heavy losses, frequent strategy shifts and service
problems. Last February, some 65 percent of callers to its
reservation system hung up in frustration before they could get
through to an agent.
</P>
<P>
   That same month, Joseph O'Gorman, a retired United Airlines
executive, took over as Reno's president. He cut the work force by
15 percent, eliminated unprofitable routes and replaced all 11
senior executives with five of his own choosing. Profits returned.
But O'Gorman decided Reno needed a big partner.
</P>
<P>
   American bought Reno for $124 million to bolster its presence on
the West Coast. While American has a strong east-to-west routes,
including San Francisco to New York, it has virtually no
north-to-south flights in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The California market is dominated by Southwest Airlines and by
United, a unit of the UAL Corp. United set up a low-priced shuttle
service and uses those short flights to feed its cross-country and
cross-Pacific flights. Without north-south flights, American could
not do this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers who fly up and down the coast every week may
occasionally fly transcontinental and they are inclined to use the
same carrier,'' said Donald O'Hare, a 40-year employee of American
Airlines, who took over last week as the new president of Reno from
O'Gorman, who left after the takeover was completed.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare, who has embarked on a whirlwind trip to meet Reno
employees in 16 cities, said almost all Reno workers would be
offered jobs at American, though the airline's headquarters in Reno
would close and some people might have to move. The Reno name is
expected to be discontinued.

GEORGETTE MOSBACHER: YOU CAN'T BE TOO RICH OR TOO REPUBLICAN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now for some really jarring news.
</P>
<P>
   Georgette Mosbacher, the voracious socialite and Republican
fund-raising juggernaut, grouts her own tiles. It also may shock
her Fifth Avenue friends, but Ms. Mosbacher was recently caught by
her butler drilling holes in the library wall to hide some unruly
computer wires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just a pretty face,'' Ms. Mosbacher said with a husky
laugh as she sat in her drawing room, which was filled with the
kind of stuff one might expect in a sprawling $10 million co-op
whose windows perfectly frame the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   There are crystal chandeliers, gold-tasseled silk settees,
faux-Roman marble busts and a pair of hyperactive cavalier King
Charles spaniels that send Ms. Mosbacher's voice into another
octave.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're my wild child!'' she squealed as Eve, the 1-year-old,
hopped into her lap. (The other dog's name is Adam.)
</P>
<P>
   She may have a domestic staff of four, but Ms. Mosbacher, 52,
takes comfort in knowing that she can change her own spark plugs if
need be. ``I learned a long time ago that I can't depend on anyone
but myself,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though more than two years have passed since Robert A.
Mosbacher, the Bush administration commerce secretary, phoned to
say he was filing for divorce, Ms. Mosbacher still gets weepy when
the matter is raised _ usually by her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just come from a place that is below hell,'' she said of
their breakup after 15 years of marriage. Tears began to well up.
``There were times I didn't think I would make it.''
</P>
<P>
   But made it she has, and Ms. Mosbacher has thrown herself back
into public life with zeal. She became an executive member of the
Republican Leadership Council, and in November she organized a
$1,000-a-plate gala for New York Gov. George Pataki in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   This year Fortune magazine crowned her one of the nation's top
Republican fund-raisers. ``I once raised $15 million in one night
for the Republican National Committee,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has also been busy lately promoting ``It Takes Money,
Honey,'' a chatty personal finance primer for women that has
headings like ``Put a Price Tag on Your Dreams,'' ``Consider a
Makeover'' and ``Establish a Secret Stash.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, written with Diane Harris and published by Reganbooks,
is already in its fourth printing.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Ms. Mosbacher qualified to give out financial advice?
``I've been rich and I've been poor,'' she said, echoing Sophie
Tucker's credo. ``And let me tell you, rich is better.'' More than
that, she knows a thing or two about making money.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago she sold her cosmetics company, La Prairie, for
$60 million. Her one-woman marketing consultancy, Georgette
Mosbacher Enterprises, brings in a nice income. And there's the
half-million dollars in annual alimony she gets from Mosbacher, a
Houston oilman.
</P>
<P>
   Though she married three well-moneyed men, she is quick to point
out that she never stopped working. ``I didn't make the mistake of
confusing their wealth for my own,'' she said. That is because she
has never been able to get the taste of poverty out of her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Mosbacher was 7, her father was killed in a car
accident, leaving her unskilled mother penniless and jobless. The
family, which lived in a down-and-out Indiana steel town, moved in
with Georgette's maternal grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Georgette, the oldest of four children, became a breadwinner as
soon as she could count out change. She was a baby sitter, took in
ironing, worked as a carhop, bookkeeper, dressmaker and switchboard
operator. ``You name it, I did it,'' she said, explaining the
grouting and drilling skills.
</P>
<P>
   It was that by-the-bootstraps childhood that drew her to the
Republicans, she said. While her classmates at Indiana University
were protesting the Vietnam War, she was holding down three jobs
and voting for Barry Goldwater. ``I missed the 60s, emotionally and
intellectually,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; She says she is proud to have never voted Democratic, mostly
because she finds the party's fondness for taxes ``obscene'' and
``fundamentally contrary to democracy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of her heroes? New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who she says
has made it possible for her to walk her dogs along Fifth Avenue
late at night.
</P>
<P>
   The glamour-filled years living in George Bush's Washington
helped solidify Ms. Mosbacher's Republican ardor. ``It was like a
dream come true,'' she said, recalling the state dinners, the trips
around the globe and the notoriety of being a fun-loving,
party-throwing redhead in what was probably the most staid epoch in
recent presidential history.
</P>
<P>
   Her windowsills remain thick with signed photographs of Newt,
Ronald and Rush. Lady Thatcher's portrait sits in the guest
washroom, and another snapshot features Ms. Mosbacher waltzing with
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Ms. Mosbacher idolizes her party. When it
comes to the Republicans' doomed impeachment drive, she offers the
following adjectives: Confused. Idiotic. Impotent.
</P>
<P>
   She may be one of the few party stalwarts publicly to cheer the
end of Clinton's trial. ``It's really been a disaster for us,'' she
said. ``We've been flailing around, bumping into walls, clueless
about what to do next.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she has kind words for Clinton (whose photograph is
also displayed in her Republican gallery). ``My God,'' she said
with a stage whisper, ``what a dummy.''

U.S. HAMMERS AT MICROSOFT'S BROWSER DEALS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Va.)   (jw) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior Microsoft official acknowledged in federal
court Wednesday that the company's contracts had prohibited
Internet service providers from offering its browser on the same
Web page as its main competition because Microsoft executives
``thought we would lose in a side-by-side choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The admission clearly pleased David Boies, the government lawyer
who elicited it from the witness, Cameron Myhrvold, a vice
president in the Microsoft Corp.'s Internet Customer Unit division
_ so much so that Boies asked the same question four different ways
and got the same answer each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it true you were trying to prevent Internet service
providers from presenting Netscape and Internet Explorer side by
side so users could choose?'' he asked at one point. Internet
Explorer is the name of Microsoft's browser; Netscape
Communications Corp.'s Navigator is its principal rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we would lose in a side-by-side choice,'' Myhrvold
answered, because Netscape was already so firmly established in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it was another bad day in court for Microsoft in its
antitrust battle with the Justice Department, which charges that
the software giant used a monopoly in personal computer operating
systems to achieve a dominant position in Internet software. Hour
after hour, Boies chiseled away at Myhrvold's testimony, forcing
him to acknowledge incorrect assertions, misleading omissions and
deceptive statements.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold repeatedly acknowledged that he made misstatements in
e-mail memos. He also testified that he disagreed with Microsoft
employees whose memos contradicted his own assertions.

   As he completed his testimony Wednesday evening it was clear
that Myhrvold's appearance had not helped Microsoft's case. In
fact, as Microsoft's defense reached its midpoint on Wednesday
evening, none of its first five witnesses had proved particularly
effective advocates of the company's position.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold, a brother of Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's chief
technology officer, is in charge of the Microsoft division that
negotiates agreements with Internet service providers, the
companies that give computer users access to the Internet. The
government charges that Microsoft's restrictive contracts with
these companies are anticompetitive and illegal. Myhrvold tried to
make the case that the contracts were largely ineffective or
benign.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these companies have agreements to be listed in the
Internet Referral Service in Microsoft's Windows operating system,
which enables users to subscribe to an Internet service posted
there. On Tuesday, Myhrvold insisted that the government's
assertion that these companies had to favor Explorer over Navigator
to be included in the service was ``absolutely wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But under further cross-examination by Boies on Wednesday,
Myhrvold admitted that in most cases the companies had been
required to ship Explorer to at least 75 percent of their
customers. Myhrvold added that they were free to stop shipping the
Microsoft product if they wanted, in which case they could be
dropped from the Windows referral service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly subtle point,'' Myhrvold acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in his written direct testimony, Myhrvold pointedly
noted that several Internet service providers in the referral
service were not shipping Explorer as required, and yet the company
had decided not to enforce the contracts.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he wrote, ``of the copies of Web browsing software
shipped by Concentric,'' a reference to Concentric Networks, a
small Internet service provider, ``only 17 percent were Internet
Explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   But those figures were for 1997. Boies entered into evidence a
Microsoft document showing that by the first quarter of 1998, 100
percent of Concentric's browser shipments were Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold repeatedly noted that Netcom, a Internet service unit
of ICG Communications Inc. that has a contract with Microsoft, made
no real effort to switch customers to Internet Explorer, testifying
that one point in 1997 _ when 10 percent of Netcom's customers were
getting the Microsoft product _ was ``the high-water mark.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boies then displayed a Microsoft document showing that in
early 1998 the percentage had risen to 40 percent. Then Boies
offered another Microsoft document showing that Netcom was actually
able to control the browser choice of only a small percentage of
the people who signed up for its service; most customers were
handed to Netcom by computer makers, or by Netscape. That same
document showed that Microsoft won an agreement with Netcom that 90
percent of the customers Netcom did control would switch to
Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   To that, Myhrvold said only that the author of the Microsoft
document ``was a pretty good salesman.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Later, in response to a question from a Microsoft lawyer,
Myhrvold denied a government assertion that his staff had offered a
British division of Uunet, an Internet service owned by MCI
Worldcom, $500,000 to switch to Internet Explorer. He said he told
his staff that ``it would not be appropriate to tie payments to
shipments of Internet Explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Boies displayed still another e-mail that
Myhrvold had written to a subordinate in Britain in which he said,
``I think tying the payment to their shipping of IE is a great
idea, though I would not do this formally.'' Myhrvold explained
that the message had not meant what it said, and he had called the
subordinate later to tell him not to tie the two. There was no
record of that call, he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Brad Chase, another Microsoft executive, takes the
stand. In his written direct testimony, which was made public
Wednesday, he defends Microsoft's contract requiring America Online
to switch its customers to Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Chase writes that ``nothing in the license requires AOL's
subscribers to choose Internet Explorer.'' But a Microsoft memo
introduced Wednesday suggests the cross-examination Chase is likely
to face.
</P>
<P>
   In it, a Microsoft executive writes that ``the typical AOL user
is a novice.'' And as a result, AOL uses ``the force-feed approach.
They force feed the upgrade at log off,'' meaning that America
Online automatically downloaded Internet Explorer to users when
they logged off the service.
</P>
<P>
   An America Online executive testified earlier in the trial that
very few users bothered to switch from Internet Explorer to
Navigator, even though they were allowed to, because finding and
installing the Netscape browser was too difficult.

SENATORS EXPRESS BOTH SADNESS AND OUTRAGE OVER CLINTON'S BEHAVIOR
</HEADLINE>

(sw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Shameful, despicable, untrustworthy, a disgrace
to his office,'' said one lawmaker. ``Reprehensible,'' said
another, ``and morally wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The adjectives and phrases, employed to describe President
Clinton and his conduct could not have been more damning. But the
senators using them _ Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., in the first case
and James Jeffords, R-Vt., in the second _ were formally announcing
that they would vote to acquit Clinton on both articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And their comments, made public outside the chamber as examples
of what the senators had said or would say inside, opened a
peephole into private deliberations that featured divergent
assessments of the president's fitness to inhabit the White House
but widespread agreement that he was, at best, a woefully
disappointing tenant.
</P>
<P>
   An aura of sadness _ and sometimes, outrage _ permeated
senators' speeches in the chamber on Wednesday and hovered over the
lawmakers themselves, according to interviews with senators and the
statements that some of them released.
</P>
<P>
   ``This impeachment process has been distressing on a personal
level because I came into it with a great deal of respect for
President Clinton,'' Jeffords said in the statement he released on
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the final outcome,'' the senator said, ``I will leave
this trial with the knowledge that the president has indeed
committed shameful acts, misled the American people and brought
disrepute on the office of the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The president has lied to his family and the nation,
and this he must live with.''
</P>
<P>
   That the stinging words of Jeffords and Wellstone accompanied
decisions to acquit the president reflected many senators' belief
that Clinton's wrongdoing did not represent the kind of ``high
crimes and misdemeanors'' that warrant expulsion from office.
</P>
<P>
   The statements that several senators made public Tuesday and
Wednesday marked a shell game of sorts: Because Senate rules
prohibit the lawmakers from discussing the content of closed
sessions, senators were careful to portray the statements as
something other than texts of the speeches they had given, or were
planning to give, in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   But it was obvious that in most cases, the statements were
condensed, expanded or slightly altered versions of those remarks.
</P>
<P>
   During breaks in Wednesday's deliberations, senators said the
tone of the sessions was collegial, candid and, at times, somber.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a solemn, grave occasion,'' Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.,
said at the end of Wednesday's session. Referring to the senators'
speeches, he added, ``They reached down quite deep to explain their
conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., agreed, saying: ``People are
reaching for history. This would have been one of the Senate's
finest hours if it was public.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., said it was in part so dignified
because it was a private session. ``People are not playing to the
cameras,'' Frist said. ``They're not delivering Hollywood-style
speeches, but are talking from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Few if any of the senators who walked to the well took less than
10 minutes to deliver their remarks, their colleagues said, while
some speakers hit the 15-minute limit and were reminded of it by a
crisp rap of the gavel.
</P>
<P>
   The statements that some of them released suggested that the
speeches in the chamber frequently homed in on the tiniest nuggets
of evidence and subtlest nuances of testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath that analysis, or appended to it, were expressions
of overarching disillusionment with Clinton that undoubtedly
reflected some senators' efforts to make certain, in case a push
for a censure resolution fails, that they had remarks on the record
condemning the president's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not trustworthy,'' Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., declared
in a written statement saying that he would vote to convict Clinton
of both perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply to be near him in the White House has meant not only
tragic heartache for his wife and his daughter, but enormous legal
bills for staff members and friends who admired him and yearned for
his success,'' Lugar added.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., announced that he would
vote to acquit the president on both counts, he offered a rueful
commentary on the events of the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This scandal has seriously bruised every institution that has
come in contact with it, but none has been battered more than the
executive branch itself,'' Dodd said in a statement released
several hours after he formally addressed his colleagues in the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culpability for this damage lies first and foremost with
President Clinton,'' Dodd said. ``History will judge his actions
and significant lapses of judgment harshly, as it should.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed at times that senators from both parties wanted to
make sure they had given Clinton the most forceful oratorical
spanking possible before he was set free from the political limbo
of the last year.
</P>
<P>
   While Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I., said Wednesday that he would
vote to acquit, he did not stop there. In a statement that
revisited many aspects of the case, the senator referred to
Clinton's ``reckless, tawdry behavior'' and said it had
``undermined the dignity of the presidency and brought about a
divisive and unpleasant chapter in our history.''

FORGIVENESS FOR CLINTON A COMPLEX NOTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ended when Corpus Christi Catholic Church opens its
confessionals to those who need a midweek penance.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they retreat behind closed doors, reveal their sins
and ask for forgiveness. Many sit and pray for a while in the
church with austere white walls and stained-glass windows before
going on with their lives. They have come to clear their
consciences.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting in the back of the church, a twentysomething couple sit
in a pew and clutch each other tightly. Tears trickle down her
face, and he kisses them off her cheeks. They sit that way for
several minutes. Finally, they get up and walk together toward the
confession booth. He goes in first; she waits her turn.
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness. Punishment. Penance. It is a simple concept.
</P>
<P>
   For a nation wrestling with the sins of their president, such
notions are far more complicated. Behind closed doors Wednesday,
senators spend another day grappling with President Clinton's
iniquities and whether he should be forgiven or punished.
</P>
<P>
   As Judith Walters lights candles to the Virgin Mary, she reveals
her conflicting emotions over the president's transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Christian, I know what is right to do. I believe anyone
who is sorry for their sins should be forgiven,'' she says. ``But
outside the church, I have different feelings. I think about
politics. I think about what the office of the presidency should
stand for. I think about what a leader should be. And I think he
shouldn't get away with what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrugging her shoulders and heading toward the door, Walters,
nonetheless, adds compassionately, ``I think he is just flesh and
blood, too. So we should forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to face his judgment by day's end. Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott wants a vote by midafternoon on whether
Clinton is guilty. But some already have granted their
dispensations.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Vermont Sen. James Jeffords was the first
Republican to offer his. He acknowledged that Clinton had committed
shameful acts. But the senator, grudgingly perhaps, echoed the
refrain of the president's supporters and insisted that Clinton's
offenses ``do not reach the high standard'' of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Harkin, though he has made little effort to conceal his
views on the matter, did the same. The Iowa senator told reporters
Wednesday he would not vote to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Will America follow suit?
</P>
<P>
   At Corpus Christi, Mark Rowan was forgiving. Sitting in one of
the church gardens, as he does after confession, Rowan gazes at a
statue of Jesus with outstretched hands and talks about absolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who hasn't been wrong before? Who hasn't done something they
regret and they are very sorry for?'' Rowan asks, adding that he
believes in the power of confession and forgiveness. ``(The
president) is sorry for what he did. He deserves forgiveness, too.
We all do.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few people remain in the church as Teresa Margolis dips a
fingertip into a bowl of holy water. She doubts the Senate will
ever truly forgive Clinton for his lies. Margolis predicts the
president will be acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate,
but only because they couldn't get enough Democrats to vote with
them. But she said Clinton has another jury to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this is over, I think we're going to need lots of
spiritual healing,'' Margolis says. ``The trial has shown an ugly
side of human nature. In the end, it'll be everyday Americans like
me and you who will decide whether he should be forgiven, and
whether he deserves to be forgiven. Of course, God, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton's impeachment trial progresses, Julie
Amparano is taking the pulse of people in the Valley. Do they care
about President Clinton's trial? Do they want him removed from
office? What does captivate Americans? She looks for the answers.

THREE REPUBLICAN SENATORS TO VOTE FOR ACQUITTAL IN CLINTON
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican support for removing President Clinton
began crumbling Wednesday when three Republican senators said they
would vote to acquit him on obstruction of justice and perjury
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from the Senate's second day of closed-door
deliberations, Sens. John Chafee of Rhode Island, Jim Jeffords of
Vermont and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania became the first
Republican senators to say they would not vote to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords stressed that his votes against conviction in no way
absolve the president of wrongdoing. ``Yes, you are not guilty,''
the senator said. ``But you (Clinton) created a hell of a mess for
the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords said six or seven Republican senators would break ranks
and side with the Democrats when final votes are cast on the
articles of impeachment late Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate's 45 Democrats reportedly unified behind him,
Clinton has long been safe from conviction. On Wednesday, it
appeared the president also would escape a Democratic effort to
censure him for his affair with Monica Lewinsky and the subsequent
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, officials said Clinton plans to make a
public statement after the Senate votes, but officials were
uncertain how soon after his acquittal the president would speak,
where he would deliver the statement and how long it would last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that you can ever pretend that none of this ever
happened,'' said presidential press secretary Joe Lockhart.
Clinton's reaction likely would be ``relief and anxiousness to
continue doing the job that he's been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss, tried
to counter the GOP defections and divert attention from the
prospect that both articles of impeachment might fail to win a
simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence presented during the five-week trial ``shows the
president has committed perjury and obstructed justice,'' Lott
declared. ``The only question left is: Will the Senate vote to find
him guilty of committing these crimes?''
</P>
<P>
   To convict Clinton, two-thirds of the senators present for the
final vote would have to find him guilty on either of the two
charges _ lying under oath or obstructing justice during his
cover-up of his affair with Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Although a handful of senators missed portions of the trial,
only the second of a president in U.S. history, so far all 100 have
been present for the closed-door deliberations with Chief Justice
William Rehnquist presiding. By day's end, just less than half had
spoken, and most had used the 15 minutes allotted for each senator
to deliver remarks. Lott acknowledged that unless some senators
relinquish time, deliberations will spill over into Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, proponents of censure _ a formal statement
condemning Clinton's affair and cover-up _ abandoned efforts to
overcome procedural barriers and Republican opposition, led by Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, to get an up-or-down vote on their resolution
condemning Clinton's affair and cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she would
circulate a letter rebuking Clinton and ask senators to sign it.
The letter would be inserted in the Congressional Record and made
public after the final vote.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from both parties said the perjury count will fail by a
wide margin while the obstruction of justice charge might receive
barely 50 votes. Less than a majority vote on both would be a
symbolic blow to the Republican-led House, which voted along party
lines in December to impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure to get 50 votes undermines the credibility of the
entire impeachment process,'' Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, was less strident. ``It certainly
would say the Senate disagrees with the House vote on
impeachment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., said ``most senators think you can't
impeach the president on a party-line vote. You just can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., said evidence presented by House
prosecutors fell short of proving the perjury charge but succeeded
in buttressing the obstruction of justice charge. Gorton announced
late Tuesday that he would vote not guilty on the perjury charge
and guilty on the obstruction charge.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Jeffords was the first Republican to announce his
plans to vote for acquittal on both charges. Clinton ``gave
misleading statements ... did obstruct justice, but his actions in
this case do not reach the high standard of impeachment,'' the
Vermont senator said.
</P>
<P>
   Specter blamed his fellow senators for not giving House
prosecutors more leeway to develop their case more fully and
present a full complement of witnesses during the trial. ``On the
record of this pseudo-trial, it is my view that the Senate failed
to fulfill the constitutional mandate to try this case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Specter said he would vote that the charges
were ``not proved,'' a category that he said exists alongside ''not
guilty'' or ``guilty'' under Scottish law. ``That is not to say
that the president is not guilty, but to specifically say that the
charges in my judgment have not been proved,'' the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, Chafee said House prosecutors had failed to
convince him that any effort by Clinton to cover up his affair
would justify removing him from office. In addition, he said,
``circumstantial evidence in each of the cases is rebutted by
direct evidence or by confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts and circumstances of this case are low and tawdry,
but these same circumstances do not, in my opinion, cause his
offenses to rise to the level of impeachable acts.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, announced that he, like other
Democrats, would vote to acquit on all charges, he lashed out at
independent counsel Kenneth Starr and drew a quick rebuke from
Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin accused Starr of engaging in a conspiracy to trap Clinton
into lying under oath about his sexual contacts with Lewinsky. He
said Starr is ``out-of-control, with his own political agenda and
vendetta, with a blank check to spend millions looking into every
nook and cranny of President Clinton's public as well as his
private life. It's a counterfeit case. This was a sin but not a
crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott replied: ``The issue is not Ken Starr, but the president's
conduct. To shift the blame today, which is apparently their
strategy and suggests there is some conspiracy, is totally
ridiculous.''

FEAR OF NOT FLYING: AIRLINES TAKE A BACK SEAT TO BASEBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Airports all over the country have been in a mess, particularly
ours. People-wise, thousands have at least been inconvenienced, if
not worse. Dollar-wise, millions have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   All this in the name of a work slowdown at American Airlines,
which a federal judge ended yesterday. The pilots' union and
corporate management were in a hissing contest over a financial
issue that only those involved deem important.
</P>
<P>
   Of interest, however, has been the reaction of the Regular Joes,
who have had to endure delayed and canceled flights. By all media
accounts, anger has been at a minimum while patience and
understanding have prevailed. Very few screams of indignation are
heard against either the union or management.
</P>
<P>
   Which proves one point:
</P>
<P>
   In our part of the world, American Airlines is as vital to the
living process as any industry we have. But baseball is more
important.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Baseball has never or could never get off this
easy with the paying customers. Labor strikes and shutdowns over
the years have created more backlash for baseball than a
presidential visit to a sorority house.
</P>
<P>
   When it happens in baseball, it becomes a personal insult to the
general public. Greedy players. Greedy owners. Anger, combined with
frustration, boils over among fans. And absolutely nobody has a
good or understanding word to say about either side.
</P>
<P>
   But pilots vs. the airline company? Oh, well, that's just a
business dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Miller, the retired king of union leadership in sports,
laughed heartily yesterday when I ran by him my theory of
``baseball is more important than American Airlines.'' Also
laughing was Rangers president Tom Schieffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized very early there is a huge difference in public
perception,'' said Miller from his home in New York City. ``I took
over the players association in baseball \Rin the late 1960s\S
after a lot of years with the national steelworkers union.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the players went out for the first time \Ra strike in
1972\S, I was stunned at the public furor. I had been involved in
nationwide strikes with the steelworkers that had basically shut
down industries from coast to coast. But that created nothing that
compared to the reaction over baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Miller added, the general public doesn't regard
baseball, or professional sports, as a business, at least not in
the same way it does an airlines or a steel company.
</P>
<P>
   He's right, or course.
</P>
<P>
   But Schieffer takes it beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is part of the cultural fiber of this country,'' he
said. ``I think it's good that people hold us to a higher standard
than they do business in general, or any other sport, for that
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what this creates is a heavier burden that we have to
carry. When we have had these unfortunate disruptions of the game,
our fans do take it personally. For one thing, we are cutting into
their free time. Part of the lure of baseball is you can get away
from it all at the ballpark. When that is taken away, the reaction
is like a sacrilege has been committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Some will single out the monster salaries of the baseball
players as the real issue causing the public to resent any labor
disruption.
</P>
<P>
   But actually, the negative reaction to strikes and lockouts was
as strong in the '70s and the '80s, long before salaries escalated.
Plus, NBA players are in the same top-dollar category, and this
season's basketball shutdown was greeted by a collective yawn from
fandom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple,'' said Schieffer. ``Baseball carries a higher
importance in the thought process of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in retirement, Miller said he's still amazed when he hears
baseball fans react to a work stoppage with the traditional, ``I'll
never go to another game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've yet to hear anyone say they'll never buy another car
from General Motors, or ever ride public transit again, or ever
allow their garbage to be picked up again,'' he noted. ``Work
stoppage happens all the time in industry. But baseball, without
question, does exist under a different set of guidelines, at least
in the mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   What it comes down to is this:
</P>
<P>
   You can cancel my plane, but don't you dare cancel my baseball
game.

RULING ON GUILTY PLEA IN PROSTITUTE MURDER CASE COULD HINGE ON ONE
WORD 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID W. CHEN with CLAUDIA ROWE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last September, Kendall L. Francois, 27, an unemployed school
aide, was arrested on charges that he strangled eight prostitutes
at his home in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Later that month, after the
police found the decaying remains of several victims stashed in his
filthy, ramshackle house, Francois confessed. Before the year was
over, his lawyers tried to enter a guilty plea that would spare him
the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But the district attorney would hear none of it.
</P>
<P>
   As angry relatives called for the harshest possible punishment,
William V. Grady, the Dutchess County district attorney, announced
that he would seek the death penalty against Francois, and he urged
Judge Thomas Dolan of Dutchess County Court to ignore the guilty
plea.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a case being watched nervously by death penalty
advocates and opponents, Dolan is expected to decide as early as
Thursday whether to accept the guilty plea or put Francois on trial
with death as the ultimate penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The case, at its most literal, hinges on the interpretation of a
single word in a Dec. 22 ruling by the State Court of Appeals that
essentially jettisoned as unconstitutional most of the
plea-bargaining provisions in the state's death penalty law. The
question is: did Francois even have the right to plead guilty
before the district attorney decided to seek the death penalty?
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, lawyers and scholars say, the case is an
example of yet another leak in a flawed death penalty law that
critics have said is only made worse, and more confusing, with each
ruling or test case.
</P>
<P>
   But on a more personal level, the case also threatens to pick at
the scars created by a series of crimes that were so brutally
gruesome that they seemed almost unreal.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the victims' relatives have urged the judge to reject
the guilty plea and clear the way for a death-penalty trial. Others
want to bank on the sure-fire life sentence; that way, the families
avoid an emotionally draining spectacle in a community that
recently weathered the Tawana Brawley defamation case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so split,'' said Tammy Coppola, whose sister, Catina
Newmaster, was among Francois' victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days I feel I don't care what happens to him; other days
I feel there's no other justification than facing the death penalty
for what he did. It would be nice if we could be spared the trial,
but that means that he would be spared the death penalty and we're
talking about eight people here _ not just one.''
</P>
<P>
   Francois was charged with 17 counts of murder and assault for
killing eight prostitutes who vanished in the last two years. All
were found inside Francois' dilapidated house, which is less than
two blocks from Vassar College.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed, at first, like a straightforward case: Francois had
confessed. Grady was weighing whether to seek the death penalty. No
plea bargain was in the offing, because both sides have to agree to
any deal.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Dec. 22, the State Court of Appeals, considering
several unrelated cases, essentially voided the state's
plea-bargaining provisions, saying that they unfairly encouraged
defendants to plead guilty _ with a punishment of life without
parole _ rather than risk a death sentence by going to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot, the court acknowledged, was that the decision would
``reduce the flexibility of both prosecutors and defendants who
wish to plea bargain in capital cases,'' Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But the next day, Francois' lawyers entered into Dolan's court
and tried to enter a guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   To Francois' lawyers, one sentence in Kaye's ruling had given
them a constitutional opening: ``a defendant may not plead guilty
to first-degree murder while a notice of intent to seek the death
penalty is pending.'' The word ``pending,'' in their minds, meant
that their client could plead guilty before there was an actual,
formal notice from the district attorney, said Randolph F. Treece,
the first deputy capital defender who is representing Francois.
</P>
<P>
   As in most criminal cases, prosecutors in death penalty cases
must agree to a plea bargain before a judge can approve it.
</P>
<P>
   But since Francois pleaded to the full indictment, his lawyers
reasoned, it was not a plea bargain and therefore did not require
prosecutorial consent. It was the first time, Treece added, that a
defendant in New York state had ever attempted to plead guilty to
an entire indictment before a death notice was served.
</P>
<P>
   Grady did not agree, and on Christmas Eve he announced that he
would seek the death penalty. His interpretation of the word
``pending,'' he said, is that it refers to a 120-day window given
to prosecutors by law within which district attorneys can decide
whether to seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a total distortion,'' Grady said, ``if a defendant
rushes to the courthouse and attempts to plead guilty before the
district attorney files his notice, just to avoid the death
penalty.''

EARNHARDT TAKES AIM AT RECLAIMING GLORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ For the remainder of this week, Dale
Earnhardt is remembering what it's like to walk through the NASCAR
Winston Cup garage area as the man to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt has gotten to know the feeling well during a career
that has produced 71 Winston Cup victories and a record-tying seven
points championships. But it wasn't until last Feb. 15 that the
``The Intimidator'' broke a career-long 0-for-20 winless streak in
NASCAR's premier event, the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one year later, Earnhardt remembers that emotional day,
complete with an impromptu receiving line of rival teams along pit
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always drove me to win races _ to be the guy to beat,''
said Earnhardt, who snapped a career-worst 59-race winless streak
on Daytona's daunting, 31-degree high banks. ``When that 3 car
pulled into the track, I mean, people looked around and wondered
what we were doing. And how to beat us.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it didn't satisfy my appetite for winning. I want to win
more races. I want to win that eighth championship. We've got to
get back to there. We are starving for that position again. You
definitely want to be the guy to beat when you roll into the
racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt knows that three-time and reigning Cup champion Jeff
Gordon is the guy to beat during the 34-race 1999 season scheduled
to begin Sunday. Last year, Gordon rode a single-season,
record-tying 13 victories to his third title in four years. And at
27, Gordon _ who won the pole position for Sunday's Daytona 500 _
is 20 years younger than Earnhardt, who turns 48 in April.
</P>
<P>
   But Earnhardt and Richard Childress, owner of the No. 3 GM
Goodwrench Service Plus Chevrolet Monte Carlo, are convinced they
can contend for a points championship they won most recently in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still win championships and still win races at a lot of
places,'' said Earnhardt, whose eighth-place points finish last
year marked his lowest since running 12th in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a mark to beat,'' he continued. ``Somebody
always breaks that mark and sets a new mark. I think Jeff and
Hendrick \RMotorsports\S has done that. They've got a lot of
resources, a lot of development. And Jeff's a great race-car
driver, too. I had my day in that circle. I still think we can have
that day again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to beat everybody. It just kills you to see a kid like
Gordon go out there and be as dominant as he was \Rin 1998\S. We've
got to race him. We've got to beat him, and all the rest of the
guys. And be the one to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The gap between Earnhardt and Gordon was considerable in 1998,
and it went beyond Gordon's 13-1 advantage in victories. Gordon
bagged a series-leading seven poles last year; Earnhardt did not
win one. Gordon had 26 top-five finishes in 33 starts; Earnhardt
had five. Gordon had 28 top-10 results; Earnhardt had 13. Gordon
earned 170 bonus points for leading laps; Earnhardt had 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a tough year last year,'' said Childress, the former
driver who has been with Earnhardt for the past six of his seven
championships. ``Winning the Daytona 500 and being in the top 10 in
points, a lot of people would liked to have had that season. But
that's not up to the standards of Dale Earnhardt. We've both made
the commitment this year to have a better season.''
</P>
<P>
   Childress started the wheels of change when he initiated a
switch of crew chiefs near mid-season last year. Childress moved
high-profile Larry McReynolds from the No. 3 car to the No. 31
Lowe's Chevy driven by Mike Skinner. Kevin Hamlin replaced
McReynolds as Earnhardt's sounding-board.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the 1998 season, Childress also has entered
into an aerodynamic testing alliance with Dale Earnhardt Inc., and
Andy Petree Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're developing a new aero program; we've developed a new
chassis. We're not backing off,'' said Earnhardt, who will start
fifth in today's second Twin 125-mile qualifying race. ``It's a lot
of hard work and responsibility on Richard's part to keep things
going for us, to put that race car out there that will win the
Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things going on behind the scenes that people
don't realize.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, whose contract with Childress expires after the 2000
season, is so pumped about 1999 that he has begun campaigning for a
contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I got to worry about is driving that 3 car,'' Earnhardt
said. ``That's what's got me here, and that's what's going to get
me further.''

EGGELING BACK TO DEFEND TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE -- It wasn't so much the thrill of victory that had
golfer Dale Eggeling jumping for joy after last year's win in the
Los Angeles Women's Championship at Oakmont Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sense of relief. She had just won her first tournament
in three years and was exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that putt went in on 18, you can't believe it. It's like
birth,'' she said with a laugh. ``It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Eggeling, who defeated Hiromi Kobayashi in a one-hole playoff,
is back to defend her championship, which begins Friday, with a
fresh outlook. As much as the tournament has undergone a name
change -- it now is called the Valley of the Stars Championship --
so has Eggeling's game.
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old admitted she had been ``going through the
motions'' despite winning more than $2 million since turning pro in
July of 1976. She arrived at Oakmont last year with few, if any,
expectations and was five shots behind Kobayashi after the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   Eggeling, however, shot a three-under-par 69 in the second round
(tying Cindy Figg-Currier for low round of the day), met her
husband, Mike, in the Oakmont clubhouse and prepared to go to the
airport to catch a 6 p.m. flight to Hawaii for the tour's next
stop. But before she knew it, the leaderboard started changing.
</P>
<P>
   Eggeling's name started moving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funny thing was I finished my round, and I knew conditions
were getting a little bit tougher, but I never even thought about
having a chance to win the tournament,'' she recalled. ``As soon as
I got in, I said to my husband, `OK, let's get ready to go.' I
hadn't even looked at a leaderboard. But he said, `I don't think
we're going anywhere.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going, `What do you mean?' He said, `Look at the
leaderboard.' I saw everybody starting to drop, and I thought, `Oh
God ... oh (bleep).' Then I had to wait an hour and 20 minutes, and
all the girls are saying, `Would you relax?' I was just a nervous
wreck, like a bull in a china shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the most exciting part, just waiting around to see.
You just don't know ... you don't want to get your hopes up. Then
you do, and it's like a see-saw. When it happened, I was like,
`Yes!' ''
</P>
<P>
   The triumph was worth $97,500, and Eggeling said it didn't
matter if the tournament was shortened by rain. It was a victory,
something she hadn't experienced since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being in that position and being able to get in the
playoff ... 36 holes, 54 holes, 72 holes,'' she said. ``I don't
care how many holes, it's always great to win. I'm saddened it was
shortened by the rain, but I am glad I got in position to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa, Fla. resident, who shows and trains horses in the
off-season and is a big fan of drag racing, said she now tries to
find the time to work on her game, which never has been a favorite
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the world's greatest procrastinator,'' she admitted with a
grin. ``I have to be kind of cattle-prodded to get out the door and
practice and stuff like that. My husband is always after me to do
it, so that helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``But winning at Oakmont kind of helped keep me in it. It
vaulted me up the money list (she finished with a career-high
$277,217) and it also gave me a big boost in confidence. I was kind
of getting to the point where I was just out there playing, and I
hadn't really set any goals for myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I won in 1995, I thought, `Well, this is great. It's
going to give me a boost and I'm going to be out here longer.' My
general attitude is if you play well enough to win, it's going to
happen. But after winning at Oakmont, I made a commitment to myself
to practice a little bit harder and concentrate a little bit
harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to a very good year this year.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she also is looking forward to Oakmont, which she
called one of her favorite courses. Eggeling said she likes the
par-72, 6,276-yard test.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pretty much know where you have to hit it,'' she said.
``There aren't any tricks ... it keeps you thinking for 18 holes,
and there aren't many courses like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings out the best in you.''

ORLANDO BEATS NETS, 89-81 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ There was no inspiring victory for the
New Jersey Nets Wednesday night at Continental Arena. Unable to
follow up Sunday's performance against Atlanta, the Nets fell hard
to the Orlando Magic, 89-81.
</P>
<P>
   But the night was not a total loss for Nets coach John Calipari.
With four of his top eight players sidelined, winning the game was
not his only concern. Escaping injury-free was also a priority. And
thankfully for the Nets and their fans in the boisterous crowd of
13,217, no one else was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Now 1-2, the Nets' makeshift club will have to wing it one more
time, Thursday in Milwaukee. Under the leadership of their new
coach, George Karl, the Bucks are 2-0 and will probably not have to
worry about the injured Sam Cassell, Kerry Kittles, Rony Seikaly
and Eric Murdock of the Nets. Calipari said before the game that
none of the four would play against Milwaukee, though he hopes to
have everyone in the lineup Monday against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   As for Wednesday night, the Magic took command a few minutes in
and never looked back, sprinting to a halftime lead of 51-43 and a
third-quarter advantage of 69-51. The Nets, who trailed by 73-53
with 10 minutes remaining, pulled within eight points three times
but never truly challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Anderson and Anfernee Hardaway did the most damage for the
Magic (3-1), scoring 21 points apiece. Anderson built Orlando's
lead early, hitting four of five 3-pointers in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Van Horn and Scott Burrell led the Nets with 17 points
each, and Kendall Gill added 15. Jayson Williams was monumental on
the boards, grabbing a game-high 21 rebounds. But the
6-foot-10-inch center, who is playing with a broken nose, continued
to struggle from the field, missing all 10 of his shots. He
finished with two points and has not made a basket since the
opening game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando was sharp from the outset, moving the ball well in
half-court sets and driving hard to the basket. The Nets were not
nearly as sterling, as they struggled to get into their offense and
missed several open jump shots. The Magic began putting distance
between the clubs four minutes into the game when Anderson drained
his first 3-pointer to give Orlando a 15-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Though Van Horn was hot, scoring eight points, and Williams was
active, grabbing eight rebounds, the Nets finished the quarter down
by 27-21. Hardaway was too much for Gill, who went to the bench at
the 3-minute-51-second mark after picking up his second foul, and
scored 10 in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hit two of his three 3-point attempts to give the crowd
a taste of things to come.

PRINCETON'S UNFORGETTABLE COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With dozens of college basketball games each night, there is
barely enough newspaper space for the contests involving ranked
teams. A report on other games is usually brief and reserved for
the unusual.
</P>
<P>
   This sentence appeared in yesterday's ``Star-Telegram'':
``Trailing 40-13, Princeton (16-4, 7-0 Ivy League) rallied for a
50-49 victory over Penn (14-4, 6-1) in Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, Paul Harvey and basketball fans, the rest of the story:
</P>
<P>
   Princeton was playing Penn in an Ivy League game between the two
teams that have dominated that conference this decade. And the game
was played at the Palestra, which is to college basketball there
what the Cotton Bowl is to football here.
</P>
<P>
   With that background, here's what happened. Princeton took a 3-0
lead and then didn't score for nearly 14 minutes as Penn went on a
29-0 run. At halftime, the Quakers led 33-9. With 15:15 remaining,
Princeton was down 40-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could have gone home, I would have,'' Princeton senior
forward Gabe Lewullis said.
</P>
<P>
   But he stayed and played, as did the rest of the Tigers. They
closed the game with a 37-9 run that produced an improbable
victory. It was the biggest comeback in a game since Kentucky
rallied from 31 down to win at Louisiana State in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're all in a little bit of shock,'' Penn coach Fran
Dunphy said. ``We succumbed to the pressure. I was very
disappointed with not finishing what was as good as we can play in
the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn was scoreless over the last 5:15. The Quakers had 12
turnovers in the second half and made only four of 12 shots after
going 13-of-27 in the first half. Not even Michael Jordan _ yes,
that's the name of Penn's best player _ could save the Quakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many big shots, I don't even remember which one
was the winning basket,'' said Princeton coach Bill Carmody, who is
35-0 in Ivy League games.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, coach, freshman center Chris Young of Highland
Park High School put the Tigers ahead to stay with 2:14 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shot wasn't any different than the shots I got in the
first half,'' said Young, who missed all eight of his first-half
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   But Young's shot provided symmetry. Princeton scored first and
last. What was in between, well, even those who were there to watch
or participate still can't believe what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was over I had nothing left,'' said Princeton senior
guard Brian Earl, who had a game-high 20 points. ``I just broke
down. I don't remember ever feeling like that after a game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've won in the NCAA Tournament, we beat UCLA, we've won a
lot of big games since I've been here,'' Lewullis said. ``But this
game was just unbelievable. I still can't even realize the fact
that we won. We were so far back. It's just mesmerizing.''
SPOTLIGHT
Vertically challenged Rogers is soaring in Penders' offense
</P>
<P>
   Big surprises can come in small packages. Ask Shawnta Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers is George Washington's senior point guard. He is listed
as 5 feet, 4 inches tall. Actually, that might be stretching it.
He's probably closer to 5-3. But 64 inches is not Rogers' key
statistic.
</P>
<P>
   He's leading the Atlantic 10 Conference in scoring (21.5 per
game), assists (7.0 per game) and steals (3.75 per game). No
Atlantic 10 player has ever accomplished that statistical hat trick
for a season. He's also fourth in 3-point field goals per game and
is making 85.3 percent of his free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while, you see him walking around campus and you
realize how short he is,'' senior forward Yegor Mescheriakov said.
``But he's got a lot of heart. He's an amazing player. Fearless. He
goes up against 6-8 guys, scores and gets fouled.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers has been a starter for four years. This season, under
coach Tom Penders, Rogers has flourished. Penders' open-court style
has spread out opposing defenses. That has turned Rogers loose to
drive and dish or pull up and shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He affects the game on both ends of the court as much as any
player can,'' Illinois coach Lon Krueger said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers is a finalist for the John Wooden player of the year
award and a probable lock for the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award
that goes to the nation's best player under six feet tall. And
having people talk about his height _ or lack of height _ doesn't
bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's reality,'' said Rogers, a Baltimore native who also
averages four rebounds a game. ``People are always going to talk
about it. It's no big thing to me. Sometimes I walk on the court
and people think I'm too short to play.''
IN THE CARDS
</P>
<P>
   Friday the NCAA overturned its postseason ban of Louisville,
meaning coach Denny Crum's team is eligible for this year's NCAA
Tournament. Louisville is 12-7 going into tonight's game at North
Carolina Charlotte and Saturday's game with Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Louisville's postseason eligibility has been restored,
organizers of the Conference USA tournament in Birmingham, Ala.,
are smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The C-USA tourney sold 2,000 tickets after Friday's
announcement. If Louisville had remained ineligible for the NCAA
Tournament, it would not have been able to play in the C-USA
tourney.
BEATING UP FATHER
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's Mark Madsen is nicknamed ``Mad Dog.'' At 6-foot-8 and
235 pounds, he leaves contusions and abrasions as he moves around
the basket for the Cardinal. Madsen remembers when he realized he
was destined to be a banger.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up, my dad and I would always play
one-on-one,'' he said. ``One night, when I was in the eighth or
ninth grade, I lifted him, got him in the air, and just jumped
right into him. He ran off the court, really upset, and in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how many of his ribs got broken, but he couldn't
play again for about two months.''
WRONG-BASKET BROWN
</P>
<P>
   When Illinois' Cleotis Brown grabbed the game's final rebound,
it was dramatic. ``We were holding our breath,'' Illinois coach Lon
Kruger said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Brown grabbed the ball after Wisconsin's Sean Mason shot and
missed, securing a 53-51 victory over the Badgers. The final score
would have been 53-49.
</P>
<P>
   With 38 seconds remaining in the first half, Brown grabbed a
Wisconsin free- throw miss and scored in the Badgers' basket to
make it 24-all at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mind just went blank,'' Brown said. ``I wondered why I was
so open. Then I was like, `Man, look what I just did.' That last
rebound felt good. I knew not to put that one back up.''
POWER SHIFT?
</P>
<P>
   Think Big Ten Conference basketball and it's hard not to think
Indiana and Purdue. Since the 1966-67 season, one of those schools
has always finished third or better in the Big Ten. Indiana has won
12 Big Ten titles, Purdue has won eight.
</P>
<P>
   But after Purdue's 86-81 overtime defeat of Indiana on Tuesday
night, the Boilermakers are 5-5 (tied for sixth place) and the
Hoosiers are 5-6 (eighth place) in the Big Ten.
INSIDE THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   Ray Minland of St. Francis, N.Y., is leading NCAA Division I in
scoring at 24.9 per game. Unless he significantly improves that
average, he'll finish with the lowest average for a scoring
champion since 1950, when Villanova's Paul Arizin led the nation
with 25.3 points per game. The five lowest scoring averages to lead
the nation: Player, school Year Avg. Murray Wier, Iowa 1948 21.0
Tony Lavelli, Yale 1949 22.4 Paul Arizin, Villanova 1950 25.3 Kevin
Granger, Texas Southern 1996 27.0 Xavier McDaniel, Wichita State
1985 27.2
</P>
<P>
   _ First year NCAA kept such scoring statistics.

WYOMING COACH USES TUBBS' STYLE AS BLUEPRINT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Chants of ``Billy Jr.'' surrounded
first-year Wyoming coach Steve McClain.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa fans were trying to rankle him with comparisons to TCU
coach Billy Tubbs. McClain instead infuriated them by smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, that's a compliment,'' McClain said. ``I told somebody:
`If I win half as many games as him, then they can chant all they
want.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McClain likes being compared to Tubbs, likes imitating Tubbs'
style of play. McClain likes Tubbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said this before,'' McClain said. ``The man has never
gotten the credit he deserves. He has taken a program to a Final
Four. He has turned losing programs into winners. He has done all
of this his way.''
</P>
<P>
   McClain, whose team plays TCU tonight at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum,
had a ringside seat for Tubbs' TCU years.
</P>
<P>
   He came to TCU as an assistant under Tubbs in 1994, and they
began building a program from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs supplied a fast-paced, just-like-at-Oklahoma style.
McClain supplied a big-name, big-time recruit named Lee Nailon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a recruit that TCU needed, and Lee Nailon needed us,''
McClain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that he recruited me to come here,'' Nailon said.
``He stayed on me pretty hard to be successful and so far it's paid
off.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU suddenly became a legitimate program, and programs became
interested in Tubbs' assistants.
</P>
<P>
   McClain exited in April to become an assistant under first-year
coach Melvin Watkins at Texas A&AMP;M, a weeklong hiatus until Wyoming
called with a chance for him to be boss.
</P>
<P>
   A head coaching position at Wyoming? Why not? But an assistant's
job at Texas A&AMP;M?
</P>
<P>
   ``It had nothing to do with TCU or Billy Tubbs,'' McClain said.
``It was a situation where financially it was a substantial amount
more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach, you sure you want to talk about money? The politically
correct thing to do would be to play coy, shower a bunch of
compliments on TCU, Texas A&AMP;M, Wyoming and any other school that
you could possibly think of.
</P>
<P>
   McClain is rarely politically correct, though. It's that Tubbs
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Be honest; be fair; be yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the advantage when you're an assistant coach and you
come up through the ranks,'' Tubbs said. ``You take this from the
coach that you like. This is what you don't like, so you throw it
away. You just get bits and pieces and you keep what you like and
throw away what you don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   McClain has borrowed substantially from Tubbs.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of Tubbs' up-and-down, back-and-forth style of
play in McLain, and a lot of Tubbs' in-your-face way of dealing
with officials and his so-what-if-people-get-mad way of talking in
McClain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took TCU's program and ideas and took them to Wyoming,''
McClain said, without a tinge of remorse.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, Tubbs taught McClain too well.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming defeated TCU on Jan. 14, breaking a streak of 16
consecutive Horned Frogs victories in Western Athletic Conference
regular-season play.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, McClain used a style of play that looked eerily
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   And don't look now, but McClain has his Cowboys (14-6, 5-4)
poised to possibly sneak into the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expected us to be a factor in the race this year,''
McClain said. ``I inherited a team that didn't have one leader, and
I think we made ourselves into a good basketball team anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a number of similarities exist between Wyoming now and
TCU then: lack of players, lack of purpose, lack of success.
</P>
<P>
   He has recruited players, instilled purpose and achieved success
_ in a single season.
</P>
<P>
   He misses TCU, though.
</P>
<P>
   He said he finds himself glancing at scores sometimes. If TCU
loses, he feels like he lost, too. He finds himself glancing at
articles. If Tubbs says something particularly irreverent, McClain
laughs along. He finds himself watching highlights sometimes. If
Nailon has a particularly nasty dunk, McClain cheers, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a lot of love for him,'' Nailon said. ``Just
because he's over there doesn't mean I have to stop liking him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nailon embraced McClain before TCU's game in Laramie, Wyo.
Nailon simply told McClain that he missed him.
</P>
<P>
   Then play began, and McClain began pacing in front of Wyoming's
bench. A constant stream of words spewed from his mouth at decibels
that made his face turn red with fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ref!'' McClain screamed. ``Nailon's fouling him.''
</P>
<P>
   He's got a bit of Tubbs in him all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine with me,'' McClain said. ``People who think we're
alike are right on one thing: We're both very driven to win.''

DE LA HOYA KNOWS HE CAN'T JUST GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS AGAINST
QUARTEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ There is a side of Oscar De La Hoya that hasn't been
seen. The De La Hoya who talks about getting hurt in the ring,
about having to take a knee during a bout. The boxer who talks
about whether it is nobler to stand and sling punches, or stay out
of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya shared those thoughts with reporters Wednesday as he
talked about fighting Ike Quartey on Saturday at the Thomas and
Mack Arena in a 12-round bout for De La Hoya's World Boxing Council
welterweight championship. The bout will be broadcast on
pay-per-view by TVKO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the one who wanted this fight,'' De La Hoya said. ``I'm
the one who stepped up to the plate, and I said I wanted Ike
Quartey. If I hadn't, I would be fighting some Joe Schmoe.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I was losing it. To become a champion is tough. To
stay a champion is tougher. I was losing that motivation.'' For the
past couple of years De La Hoya has been going through the motions.
Training just enough to get past the likes of David Kamau, Hector
Camacho, Wilfredo Rivera and Patrick Charpentier.
</P>
<P>
   For the bout with Charpentier, who landed five punches before De
La Hoya stopped him in the third round last June, De La Hoya could
have had a tougher workout by balancing his checkbook. ``When I was
fighting ordinary fighters, I began to lose my motivation,'' De La
Hoya said.
</P>
<P>
   That was why De La Hoya, 26, went to his promoter, Bob Arum, the
president of Top Rank, and asked for Quartey, who is one of the
toughest welterweights. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My father is the one that also wanted this fight, because he
knows that my last six or seven fights I haven't been in good
shape,'' De La Hoya said. ``He knows that. He knows who I am, and
he knows my body.''
</P>
<P>
   Asking for Quartey, 29, is like asking for an audit from the
Internal Revenue Service. ``If I beat him, it will boost my
confidence level up,'' De La Hoya said. ``It's high now, but this
will take it way up. Ike Quartey is one of the better guys out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a risky venture for De La Hoya, who is used to sure
things. It is his first fight under a new partnership that he
reached with Arum, who has been his promoter since the boxer turned
professional after winning a gold medal in the 1992 Olympic Games
in Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya (29-0) will pocket $9 million for this fight, but
this time he might earn every penny.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey (34-0-1), the former World Boxing Association
welterweight champion, is a hard puncher. He has the potential to
knock De La Hoya into the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   In his last fight, De La Hoya stood toe to toe with a fading
Julio Cesar Chavez and slugged him into submission in the eighth
round. It was a calculated, macho response to a situation that De
La Hoya knew he would victoriously walk away from. Chavez couldn't
hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   If he tries the same thing with Quartey, a fighter in his prime,
De La Hoya might find himself looking up at the ceiling. Either De
La Hoya is still working on his fight strategy, or he is truly
puzzled about the best way to fight Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ike Quartey has good physical conditioning; he can last 12
rounds,'' De La Hoya said. ``I might box him. But I might stand and
slug with him. I'm capable of slugging it out with him, but that
might not be the best thing to do in the fight. He can knock me out
if he hits me with a good shot, and I can knock him out if I hit
him with a good shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll stand in there with anybody. I can go in there and bang
with him. I can take it, because that is how I've prepared for this
fight. I've trained to stay in there and slug.''  &QL;

NYC COLUMN: A PRICE IS A PRICE, EXCEPT FOR VALENTINE ROSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New Yorkers are in luck this week. Unlike other
Americans, who are forced to shop for Valentine's Day without any
official guidance, we have the annual rose survey from the
Department of Consumer Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Jules Polonetsky, the agency's commissioner, called a news
conference to reveal that local florists raise the price of roses
by about 33 percent for Valentine's Day. This correlation between
price and demand might seem inevitable to some people _ anyone,
say, who has opened an economics textbook _ but Polonetsky will not
stand for it.
</P>
<P>
   Besides lamenting the price increases, he has developed a
strategy to help New Yorkers avoid, as he put it, ``seeing red this
Valentine's Day.'' Pointing to a critical discovery made by his
agency's investigators _ that different florists in New York charge
different prices _ he outlined a technique for buying flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers,'' he explained, ``can save significantly by
choosing one florist over another.''
</P>
<P>
   Could this particular strategy _ the technical term is
``shopping'' _ have applications even beyond Valentine's Day roses?
Possibly, although the commissioner did not elaborate. Nor did he
address another question raised by his agency's research: do the
investigators at the Department of Consumer Affairs have a little
too much time on their hands?
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers depend on the consumer agency to enforce laws
against fraud, but they generally manage to deal with honest
merchants all by themselves. They could probably survive without
any of the agency's seasonal price surveys _ roses on Valentine's
Day, gasoline on Memorial Day, turkey at Thanksgiving, gefilte fish
at Passover.
</P>
<P>
   These rituals have given Polonetsky and his predecessors
publicity as they wail against seasonal price increases, but
consumers do not necessarily benefit. If florists didn't raise
prices at Valentine's Day, consumers would suffer in two ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, many cost-conscious New Yorkers who now order other
flowers for Valentine's Day _ because their partners aren't
fanatical about getting roses _ would start ordering them, so there
wouldn't be enough roses to meet the increased demand. As a result,
some rose fanatics would have to do without.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the customers who buy roses at other times of the year
would end up paying artificially high prices to subsidize the
customers on Valentine's Day. There's a good reason that prices are
higher this week: the roses cost extra to grow and ship.
</P>
<P>
   To meet this annual peak in demand, growers in the United
States, Colombia, Ecuador and Holland must prune their bushes in
the late fall to start new growth in time for Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``By pruning, you're cutting off a lot of roses that would have
bloomed before Valentine's Day,'' Jim Lebberes, the president of
Kiamos and Tooker, a flower wholesaler in the Bronx, explained.
``So you're sacrificing a lot of production, and you need to
recover that lost income somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the cost of shipping. ``Let's say there are five
regularly scheduled cargo planes that leave Bogota for Miami and
New York every night,'' Lebberes said. ``They fly north with
flowers and return south with other cargo. Now suddenly for
Valentine's Day you need to charter another 15 planes, and those
planes fly back empty, because there's no corresponding increase in
demand for southbound cargo. So each one of those roses is costing
you a round-trip ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   When you add these wholesale costs to the extra expenses at the
retail level, like overtime pay for employees, the 33-percent
increase doesn't sound unreasonable. In fact, it may reflect a
phenomenon that economists call the ``good-will factor.''
</P>
<P>
   This phenomenon was demonstrated after Hurricane Andrew hit
Miami in 1992 and created a shortage of plywood. Lumber companies
refused to raise their prices, forgoing an easy profit because they
were afraid they'd offend their long-term customers.
</P>
<P>
   New York's florists presumably show some of the same restraint
on Valentine's Day to maintain their customers' good will. With
more careful investigation next year, Polonetsky could probably
call a press conference the week of Valentine Day's and announce
that rose prices are too LOW. That may not sound immediately
appealing to him. But it would definitely be newsworthy.

ELIOT CORDAY, CARDIOLOGIST, DIES AT 85  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Cal., N.C., Canada)  By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Eliot Corday, a Los Angeles cardiologist who played a major
role in conveying American knowledge about cardiology to other
countries, particularly underdeveloped ones, died on Monday at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 85 and lived in
Beverly Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Corday, a Canadian who became a U.S. citizen in
1951, was a member of the board of Cedars-Sinai, where he was a
senior attending physician from 1961 until recently. He was also a
longtime clinical professor of medicine at the University of
California, Los Angeles School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Another cardiologist, Dr. Samuel M. Fox III, a past president of
the American College of Cardiology, said, ``For the better part of
30 or 40 years, Dr. Corday was the contact person arranging
overseas lecture tours'' by American cardiologists. ``They had
tremendous influence in increasing personal contact with our
colleagues overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Forrester, a Cedars-Sinai colleague of Corday, said
that Corday was ``the leading force in initiating federal support
of cardiovascular research'' and that he contributed to a number of
``fundamental practices of cardiology, including the management of
acute coronary syndromes.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1965 and 1966, Corday was president of the American College
of Cardiology, and in the years that followed, he became one of the
most prominent advocates of federal financing for cardiovascular
research.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, he also became a noted champion of the conveying
of American cardiovascular expertise to other countries. To help
achieve that goal, he founded the American College of Cardiology's
international education program.
</P>
<P>
   Over 20 years, more than 70 groups of American cardiologists
went to underdeveloped countries, where they gave instruction in
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment. That program has been
credited with greatly improving care.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Corday was invited by President Ronald Reagan to
head the U. S. Information Agency's Medical Science Advisory
Committee, and he went on to arrange live televised communication
sessions between American cardiologists and cardiologists in the
Middle East, India, Hungary and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A cardiologist who is a former president of the American Heart
Association, Dr. Sidney Smith, said, ``Dr. Corday has been a real
ambassador in terms of sharing ideas internationally and in
encouraging the cardiovascular community to see themselves beyond
national borders and understand that cardiovascular disease has
become a worldwide problem and requires worldwide dialogue if we
are going to to be effective in combating it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is also a professor and chief of cardiology at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, added: ``Dr. Corday
was a leader in cardiovascular disease. He was highly respected for
his contributions to clinical cardiology, and we will miss him.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1967 to 1977, Corday was national consultant in cardiology
to the surgeon general of the Air Force and he rose to be a major
general.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Prince Rupert, British Columbia, and received his
medical degree in 1940 from the University of Alberta School of
Medicine. During World War II, he served in the Royal Canadian Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, he came to the United States and went on to become a
resident at two New York hospitals, Bellevue and then Mount Sinai,
before moving to Los Angeles. There, from 1950 to 1961, he was
chief of cardiology at Cedars of Lebanon hospital, which merged
with another hospital, Mount Sinai, to form Cedars-Sinai.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 59 years, the former Marian
Lipkind; a son, Dr. Stephen Corday, who lives in the Los Angeles
area; a daughter, Joanne Kozberg, and two grandchildren.

STARS NEED R&AMP;R BEFORE BUSY STRETCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seriously, now. What good is it going to do a bunch of
millionaire hockey players to take a couple of days off and sun
themselves in Southern California while enjoying some of the
nation's finest golf courses?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because for a couple of days, we don't have to think about
hockey,'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher said. ``I don't think we'll
talk about it one bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars just finished a two-day hiatus in Newport Beach,
Calif., where they hoped to dodge scattered thunderstorms in
pursuit of leisure activity. It's a strange way for a team coming
off a 3-0 loss to prepare for its game tomorrow against the Mighty
Ducks in Anaheim, but it's a break coach Ken Hitchcock said will be
helpful in getting the team ready for the stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these situations, we're just best when we get away,''
Hitchcock said of an NHL scheduling glitch that has the Stars
playing one game in 10 days. ``We want to keep the skating to a
minimum and let the guys get their energy back.''
</P>
<P>
   To retrieve their energy and ``reload,'' as Hitchcock likes to
say, some Stars players took in a Rolling Stones concert, played
some golf or went fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there will be some guys who will find a television
somewhere and have to watch a game,'' center Mike Modano said.
``But not me. I'm staying away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have had success on such bonding trips in previous
seasons, traveling to Banff, Alberta; Whistler, British Columbia;
and Colorado Springs, Colo. This time, there could be even more on
the line. When they finally get back on the ice, the Stars will
play 10 games in 17 days and follow that with a March schedule that
has 10 road games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure the guys are relaxing, but we all know there's real price
to pay for that,'' Hitchcock said. ``Starting Friday night, we're
going to pay for this, and we need to be ready for that.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the plan, strength and conditioning coach J.J.
McQueen put the team through high aerobic activities last week and
tried to stop the ``deconditioning'' of the team that comes with
regular-season play, he said. McQueen will continue that plan the
remainder of the season with 15 minute exercises each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each player will have a certain area to work on, and he'll
work it hard for 15 minutes,'' McQueen said. ``That will be
different for every player.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said he likely will give days off from skating for
players to work only on McQueen's programs. The focus will be
toward keeping the team physically and mentally sharp heading into
the final 34 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to measure ourselves against the Detroits and
Colorados, and now everybody is measuring themselves to us,''
Modano said. ``We know that every night we're going to get a hard
push from teams, so we have to take it upon ourselves that we're
one of the top teams and we're going to have to expect it every
night.''

USC FALLS TO LOYOLA 8-5
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It didn't matter if it came against the defending
national champion or an NAIA team. Loyola Marymount needed a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions got it, at the expense of the defending national
champion.
</P>
<P>
   LMU broke a three-game losing streak with an 8-5 win over USC on
Wednesday afternoon at home. Jacob Minter and Scott Walter both hit
late-inning home runs for the Lions, who were swept at home this
past weekend by Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a tough weekend,'' LMU coach Frank Cruz said. ``A `W'
was badly needed.''
</P>
<P>
   USC, which began the season ranked No.1 by Baseball America,
dropped to 1-4, matching its worst start since 1993. The Trojans
host No.13 Texas Tech this weekend at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty down,'' USC coach Mike Gillespie said. ``We'll
have to fight through this. We've got to show a little more
courage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans tied the game in the sixth on junior designated
hitter Carlos Casillas' leadoff homer, the first of his USC career.
</P>
<P>
   Minter responded with a two-out, two-run homer in the seventh
that gave the Lions (2-3) a 5-3 lead. Two batters later, Joe
Sulentor had an RBI single that increased the lead to 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans cut the lead to 6-5 in the eighth on Eric Munson's
two-run single. But Walter, a sophomore catcher who was the West
Coast Conference's Player of the Year last season, gave the Lions
extra cushion with a two-run homer off reliever Steve Immel.
</P>
<P>
   Walter said the Lions were down after the weekend sweep, but
they hadn't lost their composure, especially this early in the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't panicking,'' he said. ``We wanted to put together a
good game. We hit the ball when we needed to.''

NYC MAYOR QUESTIONS STATE COMPTROLLER'S AUTHORITY TO DO MANAGEMENT
REVIEWS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ALAN FINDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ A lawyer representing Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
contended Wednesday that state Comptroller H. Carl McCall lacked
the legal authority to evaluate the efficiency and management of
New York City's government, even though McCall and his predecessors
have conducted hundreds of such reviews for nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the comptroller has been doing municipal
performance audits, but we can all agree that that doesn't mean it
is constitutional,'' Jane L. Gordon, a lawyer in the city's Law
Department, argued before the state's highest court, the Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer representing McCall, who sued the city two years ago
after the mayor ordered city officials to stop cooperating with his
auditors, maintained that both state law and the state constitution
give the comptroller the power to determine whether the city is
spending public money efficiently, effectively and in compliance
with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides agree that the state comptroller has the right to
conduct traditional financial audits of the city. The heart of the
dispute between two of the state's senior political officials lies
in Giuliani's assertion that McCall lacks the statutory and
constitutional authority to perform broader reviews of how
effectively the city delivers services. Those reviews are known as
performance audits.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute, which entered what is likely to be its final stage
Wednesday, began in March 1997. McCall informed the city that he
wanted to audit the performance of a half-dozen city agencies,
including the accuracy with which the city had been reporting
significant improvements in street cleanliness, crime reduction and
moving people from welfare to work.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that McCall's effort was politically motivated, the mayor
barred McCall's auditors from evaluating city programs. Senior
mayoral aides said that Giuliani had ordered city agencies to stop
sharing most information with the state comptroller's office
because the mayor believed that McCall, a Democrat, was motivated
solely by the desire to embarrass the Republican mayor and harm his
re-election effort.

$51 MILLION VERDICT AWARDED TO SMOKER IS BIGGEST OF ITS KIND
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: SUBS to ADD comment from Philip Morris attorney on grounds
for appeal, raise industry's national settlement higher in story;
UPDATE closing stock prices for Philip Morris in 8th graf, The
verdict ...ADD that Henley's cancer is in remission.)  (jw) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A state jury in San Francisco has ordered the Philip Morris Cos.
to pay $51.5 million to a woman who says her inoperable lung cancer
was caused by more than 35 years of smoking cigarettes, primarily
Philip Morris's Marlboro brand.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment is by far the largest ever reached in a
smoking-related lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The verdicts were $1.5 million in compensatory damages, awarded
on Tuesday, and $50 million in punitive damages, awarded late
Wednesday. They resulted from the first cigarette lawsuit to reach
a California jury in more than a decade, following the 1997 repeal
of a state law that barred product liability suits by individuals
against tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   William S. Ohlemeyer, a lawyer representing Philip Morris, said
the company would appeal. He said there were sure to be substantial
grounds, since, in the absence for so long of any smoker's suit in
California, the law there was somewhat unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   But while the judgment could be sharply reduced on appeal, or
even thrown out, it signals that the cigarette companies may well
have to fight a brushfire of similar suits just as the industry
hoped that its legal troubles had been put to rest with a $206
billion settlement reached with 46 states three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Defending themselves against thousands of suits brought by
individual smokers or their survivors _ particularly in California,
where juries lean to high damage awards _ would prove extremely
expensive for the companies. Indeed, analysts who were interviewed
about the size of the award said they believed that its lure to
prospective plaintiffs could bring a new rush of litigation against
cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give incredible new strength to claims against
tobacco companies,'' said Mary Aronson, president of Aronson
Washington Research, which follows tobacco litigation for
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict awarding the 53-year-old plaintiff, Patricia Henley,
$50 million in punitive damages _ more than three times the $15
million her lawyer had asked for _ was returned after the stock
market had closed Wednesday. But on the basis of just the $1.5
million in compensatory damages awarded late the day before, prices
of cigarette company stocks fell sharply. Philip Morris was off
$3.9375 a share, to close at $41.4375, and the RJR Nabisco Holdings
Corporation was down $1.375, to $27.3125.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel wonderful,'' Ms. Henley told The Associated Press after
the verdict Wednesday. ``This is a great day for the children.''
</P>
<P>
   The judgment was the third in the last three years in favor of
smokers who contended that cigarette makers had failed to warn them
adequately of smoking's hazards. The two other awards, both against
the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., were later overturned, and no
such verdict has ever survived appeal. Until Wednesday, the largest
judgment was about $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the $1.5 million awarded on Tuesday was
compensation for Ms. Henley's medical costs, pain and suffering. In
addition, her lawyer, Madelyn J. Chaber, asked the jurors to award
her $15 million to punish the company for the negligence and fraud
that was found in Tuesday's verdict. The jury responded with that
much, and then $35 million more.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henley, of Los Angeles, discovered last year that she had
inoperable lung cancer, which is now in remission after
chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Lawyers for Philip Morris
argued that she had understood the risks of smoking. But her suit
said that she had smoked since she was a teen-ager, taking up the
habit a few years before government-required warning labels began
appearing on cigarette packages in 1966, and that the tobacco
companies had never told smokers that addiction might leave them
incapable of quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Until quite recently, though, Ms. Henley would have been
forbidden to bring her case. Under a 1987 tort reform law, product
liability suits against tobacco companies were prohibited in
California on the ground that the risks of smoking were universally
known. The law was repealed in 1997, around the time California
decided to file a claim against the tobacco industry in an effort
to recover smoking-related health care costs.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, California was one of the 46 states that struck
the $206 billion deal.

BODE MILLER: YOUNG PROSPECT STILL IN SEARCH OF A MEDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., N.H.)  (bl) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVER CREEK, Colo. _ It was a hungry young Bode Miller who
popped out of the gate here Tuesday in search of a medal in the
combined downhill at the world Alpine ski championships. But the
slippery course ate him instead, taking a chunk out of the young
skier's equilibrium and spitting him out like crushed ice in a
fast-food line.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old Miller fought back. Never mind that his ski had
elaminated in a brutal turn on the upper third of the Birds of Prey
slope. Nor that he had lost one ski altogether near the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Flipping back onto the only foot still capable of sliding, the
racer from Franconia, N.H., somehow kept his balance, finishing
only eight seconds behind the pack. Had it not been that Miller
missed a final gate, he would have gone on to compete in the two
slaloms that make up the combined event.
</P>
<P>
   He will have another chance to show his ability. Miller is
expected to race in the world championship giant slalom at Vail on
Friday. And there are those back East who think he can win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bode came to us as a totally raw talent,'' Joan Dolan,
athletic director for Carrabassett Valley Academy, a ski school at
Sugarloaf, Maine, said in a recent telephone interview. ``He was a
kid with natural athletic ability who has really refined his
technique. He's also a real risk-taker. Nothing scares him. It
wouldn't matter to him that Hermann Maier was racing. He just
worries about himself, and his own skiing.''
</P>
<P>
   At a strapping 6 feet 2 inches and 200 pounds, Bode (pronounced
BO-dee) Miller, a member of the U.S. A-team, has both raced and
conquered the equally brawny Herminator. The two competed in a
giant slalom last Jan. 12 in Adelboden, Switzerland. Maier won the
competition, but Miller recorded the fastest second run of the day.
That means the American beat Maier in one-half of a two-race event.
Maier captured first over all. Miller was eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Miller went on to place fourth in a slalom several days later in
Wengen, Switzerland. The experience has whetted his podium
appetite. ``A lot of the Austrians are getting older,'' he said
last week. ``About a dozen are 26 or older. They're looking at me
in two or three more seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``they'' he is referring to are United States ski officials
who have been faced with mediocre results since the retirement this
season of America's Olympic block _ Tommy Moe, A.J. Kitt and Kyle
Rasmussen. ``In the past year or two, Bode is one of, if not the,
single-most exciting young skier we have,'' said Tom Kelly, a U.S.
Ski Team vice president. ``He has shown an incredible potential and
motivation to do really well.''
</P>
<P>
   But the young Miller had some ground to make up first as a ski
racer. Having taken up snowboarding before it was popular, he only
skied now and then. His parents, who lived frugally, didn't push
it. He also was not highly motivated at school. ``I'd ace all the
tests, but I never did my homework,'' Miller said. ``I'd get bored
easily. Once you get in the habit of that, it's very easy to stay
that way. I just wasn't getting that much out of public school. To
be inside was tortuous.''
</P>
<P>
   By ninth grade, his parents decided, with a boost from an uncle,
to send him to the private Carrabassett Academy for academics and
ski training. ``I was a skinny little kid without good technique
who was getting beaten,'' he said. ``Meantime, I was looking at
these snowboarders who I knew I could crush easily. But I didn't go
that way. I was stubborn.''
</P>
<P>
   That same nonconformist streak didn't make him the easiest
youngster to coach. ``I skied to survive,'' he said. ``I went out
into the woods if I had to _ to make things tougher. It was hard
for me to have coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   He still struggles with the limitations of self-discipline, but
he is refreshingly candid about it. And he doesn't lack for self
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not able to stay put on the right spot on my skis,'' he
said, ``mostly from a lack of experience. But in two years, I'd
like to be winning World Cups in every discipline.'' &QL;

BILL FRANCE JR. STEPS DOWN AT NASCAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TARIK EL BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the stock-car racing world preparing for its biggest race,
the Daytona 500, in its 41st running Sunday, and the sport at its
height of popularity, NASCAR announced a major change in management
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After 27 years handling the day-to-day operations of NASCAR,
Bill France Jr. handed off those responsibilities to Mike Helton,
who was named senior vice president and chief operating officer of
the circuit, in addition to his current duties as NASCAR's director
of competition.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which came as a surprise to most but had been
discussed within NASCAR for some time, marks the first time that
someone named France hasn't been in charge since the start of the
series 51 years ago. France Jr. assumed control in 1972 from his
father, Bill France Sr., the founder of NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who knows Mike Helton understands why we made this
decision,'' France said. ``Mike has done a fantastic job and has
been a quick study. He is one of, if not the best, executives in
motorsports. The day-to-day operation of NASCAR is in excellent
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   France Jr., 66, is credited with transforming NASCAR from a
popular Southern sport of the 1960s and 1970s into the
multibillion-dollar sport it is today. He will remain as president.
</P>
<P>
   France, who has experienced minor health problems in recent
years, said he was looking forward to taking a step back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part is that nothing is broken so there is no urgent
mission for a fix,'' Helton said.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, 45, came upon the racing scene in 1980 as director of
public relations at Atlanta International Raceway and was named
general manager in 1985. For the next nine years, Helton served in
various capacities at Daytona International Speedway, Talladega
Superspeedway and the International Speedway Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   It was Helton's versatile resume that made him the first choice
to replace France. Helton had more experience than Brian France,
Bill France Jr.'s only son, who seemed to be a logical choice to
take over. Brian France, 36, is one of NASCAR's senior vice
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Helton was the No. 1 choice for that job,'' said Richard
Childress, owner of the RCR Chevrolet Monte Carlos. ``Mike's the
kind of guy who can run the show. He's got the experience, the
knowledge. I think he'll do a good job.''

ON PRO BASKETBALL: INJURIES ARE ALREADY CRAMPING WOUNDED SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Latrell Sprewell sat with his bulky walking boot in
front of his locker room cubicle Wednesday night, explaining how he
would rehabilitate the stress fracture in his right heel _ an
injury that may sideline him for six weeks. Swimming and the
exercise bike, but no basketball for now.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, Joe Dumars' hamstring is cramping up. In Toronto,
Kevin Willis is battling back spasms. In Miami, Pat Riley's team is
in big trouble. Jamal Mashburn will miss at least two weeks with a
severe bone contusion in his left knee. Voshon Lenard has decided
to have surgery for a stress fracture in his left tibia and may
miss the season.
</P>
<P>
   Lockout basketball . . . it is fatalistic.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be turnovers were the problem. But in this
labor-ravaged season, the team with the fewest magnetic resonance
imaging tests may be the one to win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is there are more people on the injury list
now than during most regular seasons,'' said Steve Traina, the team
physician with the Denver Nuggets and a member of the Association
of Professional Team Physicians. ``If you look at the injuries,
though, most aren't career-threatening. There aren't any blown-out
ACLs or dislocated shoulders. It's mostly quadriceps injuries,
hamstring pulls, tendinitis, sore feet and ankle sprains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those types of injuries were bound to happen, given how
quickly they put a training camp together.''
</P>
<P>
   In their rush to put a season together after the six-month labor
dispute, the National Basketball Association and the players union
each agreed to play as many games as possible after only a two-week
training camp and two preseason contests.
</P>
<P>
   The result has already tested the depth and resolve of several
teams. Wednesday night in New York at Madison Square Garden, for
example, Marcus Camby, who has been a nonfactor since being
acquired for Charles Oakley, received significant playing time
against Washington in the first half because of Sprewell's absence.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Van Gundy sidled up to Camby before the game and
whispered, ``You see how quickly opportunity can come?''
</P>
<P>
   Many teams also see how quickly their post-season dreams have
already faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know if there are more injuries or not,'' said
Russ Granik, the league's deputy commissioner. ``But it wouldn't be
a shock because of the combination of a short training camp and the
longer time off. It does create a little greater jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew there would be some risk; that's why we kept insisting
we have a two-week training camp instead of one,'' Granik said.
``At some point, everything was a trade-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, coaches predicted this rash of injuries several weeks
before the lockout ended. They knew many players without a contract
were not working out, and wondered if the league and the union had
the NBA's best interests in mind by trying to cram 50 games into 89
days.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks and Van Gundy are just one example of a team and a
coach that has to cut and paste and wait. It should make for some
interesting lineup changes the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In one game, the Knicks went from a team fielding the smallest
starting lineup in the league to a beefier, less athletic outfit.
Kurt Thomas started Wednesday night at power forward, and Camby and
the forgotten Dennis Scott received playing time in the first half.
If that big lineup produces, maybe Sprewell returns in a few weeks
as a sixth man _ the role John Starks filled so well for the last
three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, in a three-month season, depth becomes so important.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was great concern from the teams and the physicians
because you can't legislate to make guys come into camp in shape,''
said Glenn Perry, the NBA's team physicians' president, who works
as the Charlotte Hornets' doctor. ``Some of the players who came to
camp weren't in shape and they didn't have a long period of time to
get in shape. It's hard to say whether it's circumstance or due to
something else. But when you play a lot of games at a compressed
level, the body needs time to recover. Those back-to-back-to-back
games are probably going to take their toll.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, New York, Detroit and Toronto, they already have.
Charles Barkley went for an MRI on Wednesday in Houston. It is not
an aberration anymore. It is what happens when a season is thrown
together in a short amount of time. In a year of lockout
casualties, you don't wonder who is going to the finals. You wonder
whose hamstring is the next to go. &QL;

CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR STRESSES SPENDING CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Setting a course his aides called
``responsible Republicanism,'' Gov. John Rowland proposed a
two-year Connecticut budget Wednesday that took advantage of the
galloping economy by giving taxpayers a rebate for a second year in
a row, but also aimed to eliminate state offices that he considered
wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland proposed income-tax credits for tuition and property tax
payments, but did not seek a cut in the state income tax rate.
Democrats have opposed such a cut, saying that could create
problems when the economy turns down. The omission was a reminder
that Rowland has abandoned his drive to eliminate the income tax, a
campaign pledge when he was first elected governor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest challenge we face in the years ahead is
controlling the growth of government spending,'' he said during
Wednesday's address to a joint session of the state Senate and
House of Representatives. ``As our economy continues to grow and to
gain momentum, the worst thing that state government can do is
abandon the tight-fisted control that we have maintained during the
1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who control both houses of the Legislature, said the
new budget incorporated so many of their priorities that there was
an odd dynamic on the floor, with Democrats embarrassed to be
clapping so much and Republicans aghast at the largess the governor
was dispensing. The scene reflected the delicate line moderate
Republican governors have to tread as they try to ease their party
toward the center without losing conservatives, who are the party's
backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland did pick one political fight, proposing elimination of
the state's eight high sheriffs, a last vestige of county
government. Under his plan, which would be put to voters as a
constitutional amendment, sheriffs would no longer be elected, and
their duties _ transporting prisoners, maintaining court security
and serving legal papers _ would be absorbed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   He surprised some legislators with a plan to offer a state
income tax credit for tuition paid to public or private colleges in
Connecticut. The program, which piggybacks on a similar federal
credit, offers families 15 percent off their state tax return, up
to $225 for each student.
</P>
<P>
   But one Democratic leader suggested Rowland had become a
born-again big spender. Rep. William Dyson, D-New Haven,
Appropriations Committee co-chairman, said he would work to reduce
the proposed spending increase, 4 percent the first year and 4.8
percent the second, to the rate of inflation, 1 percent to 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed budget is $11.6 billion for the fiscal year
beginning July 1 and $12.1 billion for the next year. A final
version is due by June 9.
</P>
<P>
   Some hope Rowland will be considered as a vice presidential
candidate next year, and his budget is in sync with the
``compassionate conservatism'' of Gov. George Bush of Texas, whom
Rowland endorsed this week for the party's presidential nomination.

NEXT ON IOC AGENDA: APPEASING ITS SPONSORS  
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also OLY-WELCH) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The marketers of the International Olympic Committee
will try to assure their top sponsors Thursday of the
organization's resolve to reform itself amid the widening scandal
surrounding Salt Lake City's fevered drive to snare the 2002 Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings in Manhattan, scheduled a month ago, will update
the 11 worldwide sponsors on the investigations into improper
gift-giving that have implicated 24 IOC members, and the plans for
cleaning up the IOC's insular business practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're understandably concerned,'' said Michael Payne, the
IOC's marketing director. ``They've told us to do what we have to
do to get to the bottom of it, to go all the way. Clearly, things
have to be changed, but it's not possible to fix it all in 24
hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne will join Richard Pound, the IOC vice president in charge
of marketing, in the sponsor briefings. Assuaging the concerns of
the worldwide sponsors is paramount because each pays an average of
$40 million to attach its corporate image and products to the
Olympic rings. If the widening scandal cannot be contained quickly,
and the IOC's proposed reforms fail, the value of the sponsorships
could fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be satisfied until the issue is finally put to
rest,'' said Ben Deutsch, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, which has
committed to sponsoring the Olympics through 2008. ``We're anxious
to hear what they have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The sponsor that has been most vocal about the Olympic scandal
has been John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance. David D'Alessandro,
John Hancock's president, has consistently criticized the IOC's
ability to investigate itself. He has also halted talks with NBC
Sports about buying $20 million in commercial time for the 2000
Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, and ordered the Olympic rings
stripped from a John Hancock billboard at Fenway Park and on
courtside signs at the Fleet Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at this situation carefully, the IOC isn't
listening to the national organizing committees or the press, so
perhaps they'll listen to the people sending them money,''
D'Alessandro said. He added that he was particularly dissatisfied
that the IOC had absolved the Australian Olympic Committee of
wrongdoing for offering $70,000 to two African IOC members on the
eve of Sydney's two-vote victory over Beijing for next year's
Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alessandro said he was not trying to force the IOC to rebate
any of Hancock's fee. ``This isn't about forcing the price down,''
he said. ``But if the rings devalue in the consumers' mind, then
they decline in value to the sponsors and to television.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne said that sponsor fees were secured through signed
contracts, but acknowledged that ``we're in trouble'' if the
scandals were not contained quickly. Payne, perhaps seeking an
optimistic spin, said a series of swiftly enacted, enforceable
reforms ``could make the sponsorships worth more in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   At Coca-Cola, the company has chosen to ``move forward on all
things Olympic,'' said Deutsch, despite the uncertainty generated
by the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making a very specific distinction between the
administration of the Games and the Games themselves,'' Deutsch
added. ``We'll do everything we can to support our sponsorship and
to get the full value from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch said he was not certain if Thursday's meetings would end
with any joint action or statement by the sponsors. ``We'll find
that out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Klingensmith, the president of Sports Illustrated
magazine, a worldwide Olympic sponsor through 2004, said, ``It's
our sincere hope that the IOC faces its problems in a serious,
expeditious way.'' He declined to say if he believed that the IOC
has handled itself in such a manner.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt abandoned a plan for
statewide Internet deregulation in the face of an accusation that
US West, a U.S. Olympic Committee telecommunications sponsor that
would have benefited from the proposal, had released $5 million in
sponsorship money that it had withheld, in return for favorable
treatment. US West denied the accusation.

   LOS ANGELES: and succession of officials.
</P>
<P>
   Zine and Glushon have raised questions as to whether there is an
effort to water down what was approved by the conference committee
on these and other issues in which the elected panel's
recommendations were to be incorporated but the language was
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Elected Commissioner Janice Hahn has questioned why they should
even bother going to the City Council with the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   She has suggested the elected group just take over the unified
plan, refine it and submit it directly to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   But Chemerinsky and Kieffer think it is important to get the
City Council on board to present a unified front to try to pass the
reform plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something we want to take into the next century,''
Kieffer said. ``I think it does make meaningful change. Look, there
are always going to be your hard-core secessionists who will oppose
this. But there are just as many who support it.''
</P>
<P>
   Xandra Kayden, president of the League of Women Voters who
served briefly on the appointed panel, also defended the reform
plan from attacks by homeowner groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the self-selected advisory neighborhood councils, you
undercut the power of the homeowner groups,'' Kayden said. ``You
also have a chance to build a network of neighborhood groups that
we haven't seen in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with his skepticism and suspicions, Glushon said he will
campaign for the charter plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it have all I want? No,'' Glushon said. ``As it sits
right now, it is better than what we have. It does provide for
greater accountability. It does provide a basis for improved
representation. It does provide for a better structure of
government than we have today.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have to remind ourselves it is not the end-all, be-all.
It is a start. We can continue to make changes to make it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, one of the two fathers of the charter reform movement,
admits some disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it this way, I had far greater expectations for my
child,'' Fleming said. ``But there's an old story of you never
going broke if you take a profit. What this does is give us
something far better than we have now. But considering the
potential, it's a disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fleming said he would support the new proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does give some more community empowerment,'' Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it going to abate the sentiment of those who want to split
off? No, that's still going to be there. This is a small step
forward, but still a step forward.''

SOME SAY EFFORT TO REVISE L.A. CHARTER FALLS SHORT OF GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- It started three years ago in the parking lot of
a suburban supermarket with the promise of neighborhood empowerment
and decentralized government.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan and Fire Commissioner David Fleming, their
shirt sleeves rolled up on a hot August day in 1996, stopped
shoppers to collect petitions to deal with perhaps the most arcane
aspect of city government -- rewriting the City Charter.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was designed to make the city more responsive to its
communities and was seen as a way to head off the then-nascent San
Fernando Valley secession drive.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan was successful in seeing his charter reform movement win
voter support although his candidate slate was routed in electing a
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a compromise proposal hammered out between the elected and
City Council-appointed commissions is nearly complete and the
process might be adding fuel to the effort to create a new city,
not only in the Valley but in other areas around Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of the reform effort, some of the most
far-reaching proposals -- elected neighborhood councils and an
independent redistricting commission -- have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives ammunition to Valley secession,'' said Gerry Silver
of Homeowners of Encino.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it was exactly what I expected. There was never a doubt in
my mind that city government would suddenly relinquish its power to
the people. What we wanted was more decision-making authority in
the community. What we got was more power for the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver said he is prepared to mount a campaign against the new
charter and has received indications from other homeowner groups
around the city that they are prepared to join him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see is an unholy alliance between the unions and the
city and nothing will change,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Brain of Valley Voters Organized Toward Empowerment, the
group seeking the cityhood study, said it would not take a position
on charter reform.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, however, Brain questioned the effectiveness of the
new proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a valid question to ask if it satisfies the concerns of
the Valley,'' Brain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that regard, I think it falls short. People in the Valley
wanted to have local decisions made locally. We wanted to see some
decentralization in terms of distribution of services and
representation. In that sense, it doesn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   George Kieffer, chairman of the council-appointed commission who
dominated the process of arriving at a consensus, concedes that the
debate has exposed a deep lack of trust in City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence of trust, by the public in government, by
government officials with each other, is what is so troubling,''
Kieffer said. ``That's what I hope this new charter will do. Bring
back some level of trust by making the government more
accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a twisted road over the past 27 months to get to
where the reform effort now stands.
</P>
<P>
   Even before voters selected the 15 members of the elected
Charter Reform Commission, the City Council formed its own
21-member panel to review the charter and come up with
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief early effort by Kieffer, chairman of the
appointed panel, and elected commission Chairman Erwin Chemerinsky
to work together, but that fell apart. At one point, one elected
commissioner suggested the appointed group disband itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the commission elected by the voters,'' said elected
Commissioner Dennis Zine. ``That's who we are responsible to. The
others were appointed by the City Council.''
</P>
<P>
   Elected Commissioner Rob Glushon said there were other
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their commission was staff-driven,'' Glushon said. ``For
better or worse, ours was commissioner-driven where each
commissioner has been hands-on with all policy decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The skepticism went beyond that, with many commissioners
critical of the appointed commission's final document -- some call
it City Charter Lite -- and suspicious of the roles of various city
officials, in particular Chief Legislative Analyst Ron Deaton.
</P>
<P>
   Deaton, the council's top appointee who is widely regarded as
the most powerful person at City Hall, said his only participation
was in forming a working group to go over the appointed
commission's final draft to make sure it complied with state law
and didn't have conflicting proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the appointed panel said Deaton played no role in
drafting the final document or in pushing proposals with the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deaton had no input,'' Kieffer said. ``And, as a matter of
fact, we received more input and lobbying from the Mayor's Office
than the council or anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The new consensus plan, which the City Council is scheduled to
review today, was hammered out over the past several months in a
series of conference committee meetings where Kieffer and
Chemerinsky engineered compromises on key issues from the size of
the City Council to the power of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   But that compromise has left a number of hurt feelings among
commissioners and staffers -- on both panels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an opportunity to really do something,'' said one
official, who asked not to be identified. ``About six months ago, I
thought it was really going to happen and then it got scaled back.
It's better than what the city has now, but it's not as good as it
could have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Tension between the groups remains, particularly with a series
of unresolved issues -- on when the new charter provisions should
take effect, police discipline, details on neighborhood councils
and succession of officials.

   A court threw out government plans to seize 841 mostly

confirmations of its seizure notices. Since the notices were handed
out in mid-November with 60-day deadlines, some political analysts
said President Robert Mugabe did not want the farms, but wanted to
be able to tell his party's December congress he had seized them.

   Firing tear gas at rock-throwing students, riot policemen broke

his group received money from the Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden,
accused by the United States of supporting terrorism. The leader,
Salamat Hashim, of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, has reached
agreements with the Philippines military that are expected to lead
to formal peace talks.

 BIG INVESTORS IN E(asterisk)TRADE SOLD STAKES BEFORE SYSTEM ( E ditors: in references to E(asterisk)Trade, replace (asterisk),
including parentheses, with the asterisk typographical symbol)

<P>
   Several major investors in the E(asterisk)Trade Group, the
online brokerage firm whose trading system failed for several hours
during parts of three trading days last week, sold big chunks of
stock last week just before the problems occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The two largest individual shareholders in E(asterisk)Trade,
which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., and its second-largest
institutional shareholder all sold large blocks. But the company's
biggest investor, Softbank Corp., a Japanese software company, did
not sell any shares.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of E(asterisk)Trade soared from $5 on Oct. 8 to $66.4375
on Feb. 1, but fell sharply after clients could not execute trades
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday last week. E(asterisk)Trade shares
closed Wednesday at $42.75, up $2.5625.
</P>
<P>
   General Atlantic Partners, a Greenwich, Conn., venture capital
fund, and an affiliate, GAP Coinvestment, sold 4.2 million shares
or about 48 percent of their holdings, according to Lisa Nash, an
E(asterisk)Trade Group vice president. The sales were registered
before the problems and were to have taken place Feb. 2 and Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The sales were dictated by the fund's ``very strict investment
policy discipline,'' Ms. Nash said. Tom Murphy, a General Atlantic
spokesman, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Christos Cotsakos, the chairman and chief executive of General
Atlantic who has the second-largest individual stake, and his
family sold 370,000 shares, lowering their stake to 2.6 percent,
from 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was part of a planned portfolio diversification
strategy,'' Ms. Nash said. ``It was planned, and largely executed,
at the beginning of last week'' during a brief window when insiders
are allowed to sell shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were absolutely no changes in the planned sales because
of the outages,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   William Porter, E(asterisk)Trade's founder, sold 200,000 shares
in a family trust, reducing his stake to 4.3 million shares, Ms.
Nash said, while Debra J. Chrapaty, the chief information officer,
sold 50,000 of her 833,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   E(asterisk)Trade's system problems have raised questions about
the vulnerability of investors who execute their own trades in
highly volatile stocks.
</P>
<P>
   New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said last week
that he would investigate the Internet trading industry after his
office received dozens of complaints about delayed orders and
unavailable trading systems.

HOT TICKETS 
BIRTHDAY BASH

<P>
   Now even the tickets to the Senate impeachment trial are
collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Public Library, which has a purple-and-blue ticket
from the Andrew Johnson trial, will soon have one from the Clinton
trial. Sen. Charles Schumer, a Democrat from New York, is giving
the library one from the first day of the trial, Jan. 7.
</P>
<P>
   And Riki Ellison, a former linebacker for the San Francisco
49ers who is now an aerospace executive in Washington, bid $1,600
at an auction Tuesday night for a similar ticket _ a used one. Sen.
Ted Stevens, a Republican from Alaska, had donated it to raise
money for the Juvenile Diabetes Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens ``felt sorry for the guy'' because Ellison apparently
thought he could use the ticket he had bid on for admission to the
impeachment session Friday, said Stevens' spokeswoman, Connie
Godwin. That was when Stevens said that for a bit more money than
the original bid, the winner could have lunch with him _ and go to
the session on Friday, using a ticket Stevens had been assigned in
the section for senators' families. Stevens' wife, Catherine, will
be in Chicago Friday. And yes, Ellison will have to return that
ticket. Stevens wants it for his collection.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine's Milestone
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Elaine Kaufman, the grande dame of the Upper East
Side gathering place for people who inevitably seem to have
boldface names, turned 70 Wednesday. She celebrated the milestone
the night before with what, if this were a police lineup, would be
described as the usual suspects: the novelist and Hemingway
biographer A.E. Hotchner, the writers Gay Talese and Peter Maas,
the playwright Jack Richardson, the actor Michael Caine, the
producer Jean Doumanian, the socialite Blaine Trump, the
photographer Nancy Ellison and the gossip reporter Claudia Cohen,
who was the second wife of Ronald O. Perelman, who was not there.
</P>
<P>
   But Perelman's third wife, Patricia Duff, who has been caught up
in a custody battle with him for months, was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patricia Duff walked in, she stood at the bar, then went to
her table, stopped,'' said Robert Zarem, a publicity agent who
counts himself as a longtime friend of Miss Kaufman. ``Graydon
Carter and I stood up and kissed her. Three minutes later Joe
Armstrong and Claudia motioned for me to come back. They both said
to me they saw me kissing Patricia Duff. I just said: `I'm a
Southern gentleman. I've kissed probably everybody here.''' (E.
Graydon Carter is the editor of Vanity Fair. Armstrong is a former
publisher of Rolling Stone who now oversees Worth, Civilization,
American Benefactor and Equity magazines.)
</P>
<P>
   Hotchner, who gave an impromptu speech, said the evening was
more like a reunion than anything else, with customers who had been
regulars since Elaine's opened in the 1960s chatting with more
recent habitues of the restaurant, which is on Second Avenue near
89th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they were there to be sure they'd get a table,''
he said of the partygoers. ``This is the only family Elaine had. We
are it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad Lines
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Supper Club, a restaurant on West 47th Street
near Eighth Avenue, was a sea of blue suits belonging to
middle-aged men trying to chat up women they had seen pictured in
swimsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the conversation starters at a Tuesday night party
for the supermodels pictured in Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue
fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what happened to one man who approached Rebecca
Romijn-Stamos, the model on the cover of the magazine. ``You were
terrific in the Victoria's Secret show,'' he said. She gave him a
puzzled look and said, ``But I wasn't in that show.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, hoping for a quick recovery, stammered, ``I mean last
year's Victoria's Secret show.'' She smiled. ``OK,'' she said, ``I
was in that show.''
</P>
<P>
   The model Heidi Klum was the only person (man or model) smoking
a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   How healthy is that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she said sheepishly, ``I only do it socially.'' The
cigarette she was smoking at that moment was, she said, ``only my
second one tonight.''

SALT LAKE CITY'S OLYMPIC SALESMEN
</HEADLINE>
   (See Also OLY-SPONSORS) 
(DW) 
 By KIRK JOHNSON and JO THOMAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Christmas morning, in many households, is one
of those special times when the world can be walled off and the
family becomes everything. But that was not the case in Thomas K.
Welch's house.
</P>
<P>
   In the early to mid-1990s, as Salt Lake City was pursuing its
dreams of playing host to the Winter Olympics, Welch _ then
president of the city's Olympic bid committee _ merged his personal
life and his Olympic agenda, friends and acquaintances say.
Christmas became part of the package, with International Olympic
Committee members from around the world coming to his mountainside
home here. Friends said that the Welch's six children had to wait
to open their presents until the IOC guests had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sacrificed his family,'' said Bradley A. Olch, a longtime
acquaintance of Welch's, who worked with him on the early years of
the bid campaign _ Salt Lake City was awarded the Games in 1995 _
and who is also the mayor of Park City, the town where nearly half
of the events in the 2002 Winter Games will take place.
</P>
<P>
   The report released here on Tuesday by a Board of Ethics panel
investigating Salt Lake City's efforts to win its Olympic bid
concluded that Welch and David R. Johnson, the bid committee's
former vice president, acted improperly in channeling money, gifts,
junkets, tuition payments and reimbursement for shopping sprees to
IOC members whose votes were crucial in getting the Olympics here.
</P>
<P>
   Before a ballroom full of journalists, the actions of Welch,
Johnson and a third former bid committee official, Craig Peterson,
were condemned as ``disgusting,'' by the organizing committee's
chairman, Robert H. Garff.
</P>
<P>
   But the deeper picture of Welch and Johnson that emerges _ from
the ethics report and from interviews with people who know them or
worked with them _ is not so simple.
</P>
<P>
   The report, while stuffed with evidence of how they used money
to try and influence IOC members' votes, goes out of its way to
note that Salt Lake City probably owes the fact that it will be
host to the Games to Johnson and Welch, and that most of what they
did constituted a legitimate marketing and lobbying campaign
</P>
<P>
   There are other contradictions. Much of what they did was
secretive, the report said, especially in issuing checks to IOC
members or their children, with little documentation. But more was
entirely open, completely documented in the 50,000 pages of files
examined by the ethics board.
</P>
<P>
   While the report criticized Welch for opening a joint investment
account in a local bank with an IOC member, the report said that
investigators found no evidence that any investments were ever made
from the account, or that Johnson or Welch, through their years of
working for the bid committee, and later the organizing committee,
ever took any inappropriate financial benefit for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But there also were some earlier warnings that Welch and Johnson
were not always sticklers for financial detail. In the 1980s, for
example, both men were working for related organizations involved
in fund-raising and lobbying for the development of sports in Utah
when reports began circulating about irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   The state's legislative auditor general concluded in a report in
1988 that the organizations with which Johnson and Welch were
involved ``have not been effectively managed.''
</P>
<P>
   The auditor's report found conflicts of interest and inadequate
spending controls. ``Personnel costs have increased significantly,
double billings have occurred, some expenses lacked documentation
and future appropriation requests should be reduced,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Welch and Johnson, the cumulative evidence suggests, were
both what they seemed to be to many people _ hard-working,
well-paid promoters of the city they unquestionably love,
consummate salesmen, former Mormon missionaries _ and what they did
not seem to be to many of those same people: active participants in
a corrupt scheme of site selection in which financial largesse to
those with votes was equated with success.
</P>
<P>
   Their conduct, interviews and documents show, was at varying
times ethical and unethical, open and secretive, honest and
deceptive, dedicated to their city and yet profoundly embarrassing
to it in the end.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Johnson and Welch began in the 1970s,
when Welch, who is 54, was leading a Mormon church youth group at
the University of Utah, where Johnson, 40, was a student. Welch
went on to a career at Smith's Food and Drug Centers, a grocery
chain, and he became the company's top lawyer; Johnson began a
career that mostly involved sales, of cars when he was initially
out of college, and later of state tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who is married with four children, was the detail man,
the one who kept track of IOC members and their interests and
needs. Welch was the one with the vision and the broad pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Godfrey, a teacher and former city councilman, who has
watched the Olympic story unfold, said he thought that Salt Lake
City's motives in wanting the Olympics were contradictory, and that
Welch in particular mirrored those impulses precisely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed and pride; it's down to that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey said that after Welch resigned from the organizing
committee in 1997, after a charge of spousal abuse, the vision that
had captivated many Utahans about the Olympics began to fade. Welch
and his wife, Alma, were later divorced, and he remarried last
week.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson knew how to sell a dream too, or at least identify a
market. When Johnson was a boy, for example, his family lived for
three years in Oslo, where his father, who owned a candy company in
Salt Lake City, was the head of the Mormon mission. They lived in
the mission home, which meant that a young missionaries would
arrive, live with the Johnsons for a year or two and then return
home. The young Johnson found a niche in buying the belongings of
missionaries who were leaving and selling them to the next wave.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Johnson and Welch are personable men who know
how to make friends. Tuesday's ethics report said, for example,
that in 1991 Welch withdrew $30,000 from his daughter's college
fund and lent it to Julia Wallwork, the wife of an IOC member from
Western Samoa, Seiuli Paul Wallwork. Wallwork said in a telephone
interview that her husband had not been aware of the loan, which
was repaid, and that she believed it was a gesture of friendship
from Welch, nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Welches are like family to us,'' she said. ``We have known
them over 10 years now. They came to Samoa many years ago. We have
maintained very close contact. Their son was here the year before
last with a rugby team, and we hosted them because their son is
like our son.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she had requested the loan, Wallwork declined to say.
``I can't tell you that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Welch's say that his friendship is almost too much
sometimes because, like his personality, it can be overwhelming in
its intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets so focused and obsessive, he seems to lose good
judgment,'' said Sydney Fonnesbeck, a former City Council member
and longtime friend. She said the bid committee should have known
to rein Welch in. Fonnesbeck said, ``Why wasn't someone saying, `We
know you want to do this, you think you're part of the Olympic
family, but you can't do it?' ''

SPREWELL IS WAITING TO RETURN THE FANS' EMBRACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Latrell Sprewell had just begun to feel the fans
embrace him as tightly as a bag of groceries. He was pleasantly
surprised. He had just begun to understand how forgiving people
could be when he produced. And he enjoyed that, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell had started to believe he could, at least in many
corners of New York, separate himself from the demonic image
attached to him after choking his former coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good to hear people cheer,'' Sprewell said, sitting in
the Knicks' locker room as his teammates prepared for a game
against Washington last night. ``I almost feel like I've let people
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks will have to function without him for three to six
weeks. A magnetic resonance imaging test on Tuesday revealed a
stress fracture in Sprewell's right heel. He will be required to
wear a plastic boot for at least three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment to put wheels on the Knicks is over for now. They
will likely drift back toward a more plodding half-court offense
that revolves around Patrick Ewing. Any thought coach Jeff Van
Gundy had of changing Ewing's emphasis and resting him for games on
a jam-packed 50-game schedule are over. ``That's out the window,''
Van Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell is as disappointed over the change of plans as anyone.
In the back of his mind, he had to wonder if his return after
sitting out for 14 months was too much for his body to endure.
There was no easing into his comeback with so little time to
prepare for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that had something to do with it,'' Sprewell said.
``But I tried to do everything I could to come into camp in shape.
I worked hard in the weight room and tried to prevent something
like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked if I could continue to play because I was playing on
it. The pain wasn't such that I couldn't play. But that was one
thing we were weighing. If I kept playing, what would happen? If I
did, there would be a point when I couldn't play with the pain. And
then it would have taken even more time to let it heal. It was best
to let it heal and get it out of the way. I'll be able to come back
later.''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to make an impact early. This was his chance to work
through the early growing pains of learning how to play with other
stars on the court and emerge as the player capable of pushing the
Knicks toward a title.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's hard to predict how the Knicks will integrate Sprewell
into their team when he returns from his injury. Will he be a
starter or sixth man? Will the Knicks stay the course or integrate
change halfway through the season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I'll get back and be able to contribute,'' Sprewell
said. ``The way it's been here, the way I've been embraced, I
really want to come back and do something for this team.'' &QL;

FOR DEMOCRATIC ENDORSERS OF PATAKI, NEW BUDGET MEANS REWARD TIME
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ When Gov. George Pataki announced his relatively
frugal budget the other day, he drew the usual catcalls from
Democrats hoping to depict him as the Scrooge of the Statehouse.
But the plan elicited mostly smiles from one faction of the
Democratic Party's leaders: those who endorsed Pataki for
re-election last fall.
</P>
<P>
   While the governor proposed freezing or cutting one type of
local aid to nearly every city, he called for a 36 percent increase
for Buffalo, whose mayor, Anthony Masiello, was one of the most
prominent Democrats to support the Republican governor. Niagara
Falls got an extra 25 percent; its mayor, James C. Galie, was
another Democratic defector.
</P>
<P>
   A third mayor, Edward A. Hanna of Utica, who not only backed
Pataki last year but then became a Republican, did not receive more
aid but is expecting a sizable chunk of a $5 million fund that the
governor put in the budget to help localities demolish buildings to
spur development.
</P>
<P>
   Two Democratic state senators from New York City who endorsed
Pataki, Olga A. Mendez and Alton R. Waldon Jr., are also slated to
get more money for their districts, particularly from a new pool of
at least $200,000 that the governor wants to spend on asthma
prevention and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Rewarding allies with cupfuls from the honey pot of the state
treasury is an Albany custom, and one of the best times to view it
is after a gubernatorial election, when politicians seek recompense
from the winner for their labors on the stump. These budget items
stand out even more this year because Pataki is pledging a new lean
regimen for the state, including an overall increase in spending of
just 1.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The modest growth in the proposed budget, which comes as the
state has a surplus of more than $2 billion, has infuriated some
lawmakers and local officials, including New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is a Republican who supported the governor in his
re-election bid (though not when Pataki first ran in 1994), but the
mayor maintains that the budget did him no favors and would be
disastrous for his city. The governor has staunchly disputed that
assertion.
</P>
<P>
   New York City does not receive the kind of aid that Pataki
sharply raised for Buffalo and Niagara Falls, but in general, the
governor proposed that the city's share of the state budget remain
flat.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki administration officials demur when asked about budget
items that appear intended for Democrats who endorsed the governor,
saying he has called for selective major new spending where most
needed, ignoring political considerations. ``We have put the
resources where we can have the most effect,'' said Michael McKeon,
a Pataki spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon denied that Democratic mayors or legislators had endorsed
Pataki last fall in return for promises of government largess after
the election. ``The reason why these people supported the governor
was because his policies have made cities stronger and our streets
safer and kept the economy growing,'' McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Masiello, Peter K. Cutler, said the mayor made
his case to Pataki that Buffalo was managing its money better but
needed more help from the state. ``For anybody to criticize the
receipt of general-fund appropriations as based on political
paybacks is misguided,'' Cutler said. ``We reject that.''
</P>
<P>
   Galie of Niagara Falls did not respond to two telephone messages
left at his office.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna of Utica acknowledged that maintaining good relations with
Pataki might give his city more access to aid. ``How much are you
going to get from a governor if you knock him?'' said Hanna, who
garnered a $1 million state grant for a recreation center in Utica
last year around the same time that he was endorsing Pataki.
``That's just human nature.''

A SORDID FRENCH TALE OF SEX, POLITICS AND, PERHAPS ABOVE ALL ELSE,
GREED
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ While Americans have been preoccupied with the Monica
Lewinsky affair, the French have been following a seamy sex and
politics scandal of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Its most prominent figures are Roland Dumas, the country's
fifth-ranking official, and a former mistress, who was a lobbyist
for France's biggest oil company.
</P>
<P>
   Details like the $2,000 pair of handmade shoes by Berluti that
the lobbyist, Christine Deviers-Joncour, says she bought for Dumas,
and her best-selling book, ``The Whore of the Republic,'' have
created the impression that the scandal is mainly about the money
Mrs. Deviers-Joncour says she received from her company to
influence Dumas when he was foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   But the real scandal, according to the current president of the
oil company, Elf Aquitaine SA, is the way a small team of
executives bilked the world's eighth-largest oil-producing company
of at least $259 million between 1989 and 1993, when it was still
government-owned.
</P>

   ``The final figure will probably be much higher,'' said Philippe
S. Jaffre, Elf's president, at a lunch with American and British
reporters. ``It may be impossible to determine the total.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaffre said , about 10 employees used secret foreign bank
accounts, phony go-betweens, kickbacks and dummy real-estate firms
to hide what they were doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever Elf made a big acquisition or an investment in this
period you find a middleman who sent a bill for a percentage
commission, which was paid to an offshore account,'' he said.
``Then the middleman returned most of the money to the person
behind the fraud. It was classic, textbook embezzlement.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the company was run by Loik Le Floch-Prigent, who
was jailed for six months for questioning by judges investigating
the case last year. Jaffre succeeded Le Floch-Prigent, 55, a close
associate of the late Socialist president, Francois Mitterrand, as
Elf's president after a conservative government came to power in
1993 and privatized the company the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The silver-haired Dumas, 76, another friend whom Mitterrand made
France's chief diplomat from 1988 to 1993, has denied any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   While the investigation continues, he has also rejected calls to
step down from his current post as president of the Constitutional
Council, France's highest administrative tribunal. He has not
disputed the fact of a relationship with Mrs. Deviers-Joncour.
</P>
<P>
   French investigative judges have traced more than $170 million
of company funds to numerous secret bank accounts set up in
Switzerland, Luxembourg and other countries by the alleged
mastermind of Elf Aquitaine's secret deals, Alfred Sirven, 71, a
fugitive, and other close aides of Le Floch-Prigent.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 27, two judges, Eva Joly and Laurence Vichnievsky, gave
lawyers for Dumas, Mrs. Deviers-Joncour, Le Floch-Prigent and four
other former Elf Aquitaine employees 20 days to make any final
points before the judges turn over the results of their
investigation to other judicial authorities, who will decide
whether to issue indictments and order trials.
</P>
<P>
   If crimes were committed, Elf Aquitaine was the biggest victim,
Jaffre said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Deviers-Joncour, 20 years younger than Dumas and who by her
own account did little for the company's ousted executive team
except try to keep Elf in his good graces, was also imprisoned from
Nov. 7, 1997, to April 9 of last year, while the two judges
investigated her activities.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, she wrote that she received $7.75 million from
Sirven, who investigators say was Le Floch-Prigent's right-hand
man, to keep quiet about some of what she knew. But, she said, he
demanded and got the money back in cash in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials now say she got $10.3 million altogether, plus
a salary of over $100,000 a year and free accommodation in a luxury
apartment on the fashionable Left Bank while she worked for Elf
between 1989 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Sirven left Elf Aquitaine in 1993, and moved to Switzerland. He
disappeared from sight there in 1997 and his present whereabouts
are unknown. The investigative magistrates took until this year to
issue effective international warrants for his arrest.

   According to Mrs. Deviers-Joncour, it was Sirven who, apparently
in 1989, ordered her to try to get Dumas to drop his objections to
the $2.7 billion sale to Taiwan of six frigates being built by
Thomson-CSF, which was also state-owned at the time.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote that Dumas rejected all her attempts to influence him
on the proposed sale, but, motivated by the prospect of a $7.75
million commission Sirven dangled before her, she kept pestering
the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   The sale finally went through in 1991, but both Mrs.
Deviers-Joncour and Dumas have told investigators that the decision
was made not by the foreign minister but by Mitterrand, who
concluded that Dumas' fears that French relations with China would
be harmed were not justified.
</P>
<P>
   The judges have been trying to determine whether Dumas received
any money from Mrs. Deviers-Joncour in return for decisions
favorable to Elf while he was foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has explained $461,000 in cash bank deposits during
that time as payments for past legal services or proceeds from the
sale of art works, Dumas has publicly stated that he never received
a centime from Mrs. Deviers-Joncour.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, she wrote that the Dumas case surfaced after
Thomson-CSF balked at paying a $28 million commission on the sale
of the frigates. The money was to go to Edmond Kwan, a Hong Kong
middleman engaged by Sirven.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan sued in Geneva, and when Mrs. Deviers-Joncour said she
would go there to testify against the middleman to keep Dumas' name
out of the newspapers, Sirven, she said, paid her the promised
commission _ ``hoping to shut me up,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan swore in an affidavit that his cut in the deal was to be a
mere $2 million; the remaining $26 million, investigators have
suggested, was to have been returned to Sirven as a kickback.
</P>
<P>
   The case has hardened an old view in France that Elf Aquitaine
and other state-owned French companies were used for decades like
giant slush funds by successive French governments and political
leaders who appointed compliant cronies to run them.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators reportedly found that Le Floch-Prigent personally
approved many such arrangements but are not known to have traced
any of the surreptitious bank accounts to him directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elf did have the reputation of being a slush fund for the
state, it's true,'' Jaffre, Elf's current chief said, ``but it's
undeserved. And just because it may have happened in the past
doesn't mean that employees were justified in helping themselves.''
