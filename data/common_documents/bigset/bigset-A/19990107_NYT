ECONOMIC SCENE: PROS AND CONS OF TAX CREDITS FOR DISABLED
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's proposal to use tax credits to help about 2
million disabled Americans, many of whom depend on relatives for
long-term care, includes some innovative ideas, but it also has
some serious problems.
</P>
<P>
   John Rother, public policy director of the American Association
of Retired Persons, applauds the program for ``providing overdue
recognition and support for caregivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Altman, a health economist at Brandeis, agrees, praising
the White House for ``making a real start on a real problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But even they recognize the plan's serious limitations. Critics
say the proposal skips over most of the poor, provides small
financial protection for middle-class families and largely
overlooks the potential for private insurance to handle the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers fully recognize the problems with their
proposal. But they operate under rigid budget rules that make it
nearly impossible to solve social problems the old-fashioned way,
through government spending.
</P>
<P>
   Tight caps on discretionary spending for next year leave little
room for new programs. Instead, Henry Aaron of the Brookings
Institution says, ``the proposal is testimony to a budgetary
straitjacket that forces the administration to cast social policy
as tax cuts _ the only budget idea Congress will take seriously _
even when, as is true in this case, the tax code is poorly designed
to deliver the needed relief.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration estimates that 5 million Americans receive
long-term care for a disabling physical or mental ailment. About 2
million of them live in nursing homes. The rest live in their
communities with the help of relatives or other care providers. The
cost can be crushing. Nursing homes can charge $60,000 a year or
more. If the disabled stay home, then children or spouses are often
forced to leave work and suffer the grinding stress of caring for
desperately ill loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   There are few sources of financial relief. Medicare provides
nearly none, and Medicaid pays for nursing homes but only after
patients run through nearly all of their assets. That is not the
worst of all possible systems _ it takes care of poor families from
the beginning and tells middle-class families that they must spend
their own money before calling on taxpayers to pick up the rest of
the tab. But the system turns medical catastrophe into financial
catastrophe unless the patient can figure out, legally or
otherwise, how to transfer assets to family and friends before
applying for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is for adults to buy insurance to cover the costs
of long-term care. But private insurance barely exists. The problem
is that 60-year-olds have no way to know how much protection they
are buying when they take out a policy that covers, say, $150 a day
_ even if adjusted for inflation _ of nursing home care. That might
look good in 1999, but how much care will it buy 10 or 20 years
from now?
</P>
<P>
   The administration's solution is to cut the taxes of chronically
disabled patients or their family care providers by up to $1,000.
The tax cuts will cost a modest $5.5 billion over five years and
will probably be paid for, the administration says, by closing an
unspecified list of tax loopholes. The proposed tax credit is based
on the patient's need, not expenditures, so the program does not
steer the elderly into nursing homes in order to qualify for
reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting part of the plan would have the federal
government offer long-term care insurance to its employees. The
idea is for the government to create model policies that could then
spread through the private economy.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the plan starts with the tax credit. It only
helps families who pay taxes, thereby eliminating the poor. And,
Aaron points out, many elderly fall into the no-tax category
because Social Security income is largely untaxed. The
administration hopes it has improved the problem by offering the
credit to family care providers, thereby expanding the pool of
eligible people. Still, the proposal shuts out many poor families.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's strategy is to focus on a big expense of
middle-class families and tee up a tax cut that Republicans find
hard to resist. The White House calculates that tax cuts do a
little good and blunt Republican fervor for big across-the-board
cuts that would threaten spending on programs dear to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The political tactic is understandable but comes at great cost.
In the case of long-term care, Clinton steered clear of readily
available and potentially effective solutions.
</P>
<P>
   New York and several other states have created, with the help of
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a marvelously designed answer.
New Yorkers can buy a state-approved insurance policy, typically
costing about $2,000 a year, that reimburses the policyholder for
three years of nursing home expenses. If patients who buy the
coverage eventually enter and stay in a nursing home for more than
three years, then the state Medicaid program pays whatever bills
the patient cannot handle based on income. In other words, the
state does not invade the patient's savings. The families win
protection of their assets. The state wins, too, because few
patients actually stay in nursing homes for more than three years.

LAWYERS FOR SHOOTING VICTIMS CLASH WITH TOP GUN MAKERS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lawyers for major gun makers and wholesalers and for
the families of six people killed with illegally possessed handguns
clashed sharply in a Brooklyn courtroom Wednesday over whether the
companies were liable for the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   In opening arguments in a civil suit that is being closely
watched by the firearms industry and gun-control advocates, a
lawyer for the families maintained that the companies shared
responsibility for the homicides because of a negligent, ``head in
the sand'' distribution system that led to widespread illegal
possession of guns in New York state by young people and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendants here, the manufacturers and distributors of
handguns, knowingly failed to take the most basic precautions and
actions to minimize the likelihood that their guns would cause
injuries and loss at the hands of individuals who, in New York
state, we say are not permitted to have guns,'' said the lawyer,
Elisa Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a jury in federal district court in Brooklyn, she
said that the gun industry's distribution system ``knowingly
saturated'' states having weak gun control laws with more new
handguns than the legitimate market for the guns in those states.
That, she said, led to an excess of handguns being sold to gun
traffickers and others who then sold the guns illegally to people
in states with strong gun laws, like New York.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, almost half the guns used in crimes in
New York state in recent years have come from Georgia, Florida,
Virginia and North and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But a lawyer for several of the companies attacked the
plaintiffs' arguments of collective liability and industrywide
negligent distribution as devoid of merit because ``there is no way
to hold the manufacturers and distributors liable.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the manufacturers produced new guns and the
distributors provided them wholesale to licensed retail dealers _
all in a lawful manner under a government-regulated system _ the
lawyer, Anne G. Kimball, held that illegal trafficking in guns
after their initial purchase from gun dealers was something that
the manufacturers and distributors could not control.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how sympathetic this case is,'' she said, referring
to the six shooting deaths at issue and the wound suffered by a
seventh plaintiff, a teen-ager who survived with a bullet still in
his brain, ``you will conclude that there is no way to hold the
manufacturers and distributors liable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kimball, one of a dozen defense lawyers in the case and
whose clients include major gun makers like the Smith &AMP; Wesson
Corp. and the Colt's Manufacturing Co., told the jurors that it
would be wrong to ``shift the blame from the cold-blooded killers
in this case'' to gun companies ``for seven crimes they had nothing
to do with.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the main argument by the plaintiffs that the companies
oversupplied states with weak gun laws, Ms. Kimball said more guns
were sold in the Southeast because there was stronger demand for
them there for recreation, protection and other legitimate uses and
not so that gun traffickers could buy them for illegal resale in
other states.

faces a daunting double-barreled challenge: He comes to the job of

about 20 miles southeast of Santa Fe, may be the only house in

JETS AT THE RAMPARTS FOR THE ELUSIVE BRUNELL
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ No matter how many times Bryan Cox sees Mark
Brunell fake a run, or fake a pass, or otherwise disorient the New
York Jets' defense on Sunday, Cox promises he will not waver. He
will charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, I normally don't think,'' the Jets linebacker
said. ``I won't let him dictate. My high school coach told me,
`Play what you see.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cox's current coach prizes this aggressiveness. ``He's not
afraid to play one-on-one football,'' Bill Parcells said. ``He
never resorts to finesse. He'll take the battle on.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is what the Jets' defense plans to do Sunday _ up to a
point _ when it faces the scrambling Jacksonville Jaguars
quarterback in their divisional playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell can run _ he did it 49 times this season _ and he
certainly can pass, with 20 touchdowns to only nine interceptions.
But no one on the Jets really knows how well he will move as he
tries to recover from a high-ankle sprain. He missed three games
before returning in the Jaguars' wild-card playoff victory over New
England last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Brunell admitted after that game that he was worried about his
footwork in preparing for the Jets. Wednesday was his first day
back on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a much better day today than I did any day last week,''
he said. ``I'm not 100 percent, but I feel more mobile, and if I do
get out of the pocket, I think I can run a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunell added: ``I'm going full-out. I have strength in the
ankle, I'm not feeling any pain. I feel confident.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have faced a Brunell-type quarterback four times this
season: Steve Young of the 49ers, Doug Flutie of the Bills (twice)
and Steve McNair of the Oilers. Combined, the Jets had a 3-1 record
against them. The threesome completed only 65 of 138 passes (47
percent) against the Jets and were sacked seven times. They threw
four touchdowns while being intercepted four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think playing those other teams helped us,'' said cornerback
Aaron Glenn, who may return after missing three games with a
sprained ankle of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Against the elusive quarterbacks, the Jets often used a ``spy''
designed to follow the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Cox in particular zeroes in on scrambling quarterbacks. ``I hate
when they run, and then they slide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An indelible image remains of what Cox did to McNair, who dared
run, and then slide, against him at Tennessee in November.
</P>
<P>
   Cox delivered a tomahawk chop, supposedly at the ball. But the
linebacker's forearm wound up hitting the quarterback on the side
of the head. For that infraction, as well as a similar blow later
in the game to Eddie George, Cox was fined $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cox is merely one of a group of Jets concerned with Brunell.
Jerome Henderson, who will share playing time at free safety with
Corwin Brown, said Brunell's injury is almost beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll do anything he can to get his team to the next
game,'' Henderson said. ``Any of those guys, McNair, Young, Flutie,
Brunell, they can prolong a down. You can't give up on anything _
maybe a defender loses sight of his man for a moment, and then the
quarterback spots him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Henderson said he has to also be wary of Brunell's powerful
arm. Brunell may have both feet planted. He may not even have his
arm cocked. But then he passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a safety, you look for a quarterback to lean back, and that
tips you off that he's going to throw it,'' Henderson said of
Brunell. ``But he's so strong he's square to you and he can use his
upper body to throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Logan, the defensive lineman, played at Jacksonville with
Brunell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to be compared to Steve Young,'' Logan said. ``If we
prepare for anything less than that _ his best _ we're selling
ourselves short.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the Jets' backup quarterbacks brought humor to
their mimicry of Brunell. Glenn Foley said he was going to be the
practice quarterback if they were thinking Brunell couldn't
scramble. ``I'm the bad-ankle Brunell,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it's the good-ankle Brunell, if he can move, then it'll
be Ray,'' Foley said, referring to his teammate Ray Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, it has been Lucas, mostly, in practice giving
the Jets a look at what they may face. The problem is that Lucas is
right-handed and Brunell is a left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' Lucas said. ``I'm not even in Brunell's class as
a quarterback so I have to work extra, extra hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the other scramblers the Jets have faced this season,
the extra work has translated into victories. Only Young defeated
them, and that was in the season opener _ four months ago
Wednesday.

VUITTON RAISES ITS STAKE IN GUCCI GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's biggest
luxury goods maker, said Wednesday that it had raised its stake in
Gucci Group, the fashion goods company, to more than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The news sent shares in both companies soaring on speculation
that LVMH might seek an alliance or takeover of Gucci, which has
transformed itself into one of the hottest players in luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
   Though executives at LVMH, based in Paris, assured analysts that
their move was ``not aggressive,'' they chose the holiday in
observance of the Epiphany, when banks and brokerage firms are
closed in Italy, to disclose the move. Such a disclosure is
required under Dutch law once a holding surpasses 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gucci, though based in Florence, is incorporated in the
Netherlands to take advantage of favorable tax laws. Anne-France
Malrieu, an LVMH spokeswoman in Paris, said LVMH would issue a
``declaration of intent'' about its future plans within three days,
also to comply with Dutch law. LVMH did not say how many shares
were added to the 4.9 percent it already owned.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, betting that LVMH would bid for all of Gucci or at
least further raise its stake, pushed up the share prices of both
companies. In Amsterdam trading, Gucci's share price rose as much
as 22 percent; in Paris, LVMH rose almost 10 percent. In New York,
shares of Gucci rose $12.8125, or 23 percent, to $68.625. The
American depository receipts of LVMH rose $2.125, or nearly 5
percent, to $46.50, with each ADR representing one-fifth share.
</P>
<P>
   Domenico de Sole, chief executive of Gucci, said his company had
``not been previously informed of the transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Wednesday underscored Gucci's exposure to
takeover. It also raised questions about the purchase of 9.5
percent of Gucci last summer by Prada, the Italian fashion house.
Since then, Gucci executives have made no secret of their disdain
for a possible takeover by Prada, and Gucci defended itself by
issuing stock options to management.
</P>
<P>
   Aligning Gucci, which in 1997 had sales of $975 million, with
the much larger and well-managed LVMH, whose 1997 sales totaled
$8.6 billion, would certainly benefit Gucci. Since the withdrawal
of Investcorp International of Bahrain, Gucci has lacked a large
shareholder's exerting control. In 1993, Investcorp completed a
takeover of ailing Gucci from the Italian family that founded it
and brought in de Sole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it will be only 5 percent,'' said Jean-Marie
L'Home , an analyst at BNP Equities in Paris. L'Home said LVMH
might try to acquire additional shares to build a stake large
enough to influence management decisions and exploit the
attractiveness of Gucci's brands. &QL;

COMMENTARY: AFTER FIRE, CALLS FOR SAFETY AT ANY COST
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Television cameras will be in the City Council
chamber Friday morning for a public hearing on the ``high-rise fire
crisis,'' as it was described in the New York Post. The debate over
requiring sprinklers in apartment buildings should produce a nice
simple drama.
</P>
<P>
   Will the tenants at the hearing win new protection against
catastrophes like the two fatal high-rise fires in December, or
will Donald Trump and other real-estate moguls evade a law that
would cut into their profits? That is largely how the question has
been framed by the media.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the new law does to Donald Trump's short-term
profits, there's no reason to assume he'll end up paying for those
sprinklers. Real-estate development is not a form of philanthropy.
Ultimately the question becomes: Should tenants and the owners of
co-ops and condominiums be forced to contribute to the profits of
the sprinkler industry?
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the Council want to mandate sprinklers only in
new high-rise apartments, which would cost the typical tenant about
$360 annually to pay off the costs of installation and maintenance,
according to the Real Estate Board of New York, the developers'
industry group. If, as other council members advocate, the new law
also mandated sprinklers in all existing high-rises, those tenants
would face still higher surcharges, because it's more expensive to
retrofit buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Walter McCaffrey, the chief sponsor of the council's sprinkler
legislation, suggests that these costs be absorbed by the city
instead of by the tenants. ``Landlords could recover the expenses
through tax abatements,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   But if sprinklers were required in all apartments in buildings
taller than two stories, as McCaffrey advocates, that would affect
roughly 2 million rental apartments. Paying for systems in all
these apartments could easily cost taxpayers $1 billion a year.
That's more than the entire budget of the city's Department of
Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to wear green eyeshades on this,'' McCaffrey
said. ``It's worth it if it saves people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing estimates that sprinklers reduce the risk of dying in a
fire by half, McCaffrey said it was irresponsible for New York to
be one of the few cities that does not require sprinklers in
residential high-rises.
</P>
<P>
   But the death rate from fire in New York is not any higher than
in those cities with sprinklers. One reason is that New York
compensates for its lack of sprinklers by having more stringent
rules on fireproofing buildings. The per-capita fatality rate in
New York is about average for an American city, and New Yorkers in
high-rises are especially safe.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 103 accidental deaths by fire last year in residential
buildings, only nine were in high-rises (defined by the Fire
Department as 100 feet or taller). Here, as in the rest of America,
people living in apartment towers are less likely to die in fires
than are people living in smaller buildings. The fatality rate is
highest for New Yorkers in single-family houses.
</P>
<P>
   To wearers of green eyeshades, it doesn't make sense to
concentrate money and attention on making the safest homes safer.
New sprinklers would presumably save more lives if they were
installed in small buildings and houses _ but those are not the
homes that interest politicians and journalists. Small fires make
small stories.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the council may be tempted to settle
for a law mandating sprinklers only in new buildings, because that
would allow them to declare the crisis resolved without imposing
any costs on current voters. The bill would be paid, as usual, by
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   These newcomers already pay the highest rents in America, in
large part because of past crusades by politicians and journalists
to reform building and land-use rules. Many of these past reforms,
like the proposed mandate for sprinklers, seemed like sensible,
inexpensive improvements when considered individually. But the
cumulative effect has been the country's most complex housing
regulations, which have made it prohibitively expensive to build
new housing for the middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Today, despite a severe housing shortage, the rate of housing
construction in New York is lower than it was during the
Depression, and most of these new apartments are far too expensive
for most people. The crisis that sets New York apart from other
cities is not how many people die here in high-rises, but how few
can afford to live in them.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
It took less than an hour. Word came that the NBA and its players
were close to an agreement, pending union and ownership approval,
and Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich had just about anybody who knew
the security codes at Westside Tennis Club stationed in a
conference room planning strategies.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tomjanovich, team vice presidents Carroll Dawson and Robert
Barr, assistants and scouts have been filling the lockout days with
such sessions, running the possibilities for the retooling of the
Rockets through each proposed system that has come and gone during
the long labor impasse.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, the parameters were set. Teams will likely not be
allowed to officially pursue or sign free agents until Jan. 18, but
Rockets officials rapidly began working through the system again,
trying to determine how the fine print might determine who will
play for them this season. And by the end of the day, Tomjanovich,
Dawson and other team officials were calling season-ticket holders
to update them on the lockout's end.
</P>
<P>
   The system that will be in place soon after today's expected
owners approval could make the Rockets look very different but in
precisely the ways they wanted _ younger, more athletic and
hopefully counting coveted free agent Antonio McDyess among their
number.
</P>
<P>
   The first bit of news was good, a gift from the compromise worth
celebrating. The owners had come up from 7.5 percent to 10 percent
on the maximum raise allowed to free agents who jump teams.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials were still not permitted to talk with the media,
but Tomjanovich has often said this offseason might be the most
important of his tenure as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Sources have said McDyess, the 24-year-old forward who played
with the Suns last season, would be the Rockets' primary free-agent
target.
</P>
<P>
   Under the system proposed by the owners in their presumed final
offer last month, McDyess could have received a seven-year contract
worth roughly $10 million more by remaining in Phoenix. The Suns
could still offer raises worth 2.5 percent more each year, but a
six-year Rockets contract could be worth as much as $69.9 million.
The first six years of a Suns offer could be worth $73.96 million.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess, who moved to Houston in the offseason, has said the
Rockets, Suns and Bulls are his favorites. If the Rockets do not
sign him, it would likely mean he returns to Phoenix, potentially
leaving Timberwolves free agent Tom Gugliotta on the market for the
Rockets. Point guards Rod Strickland and Damon Stoudamire might
figure into a fall-back situation, although the Rockets drafted
three guards in June and seem more likely to go for size.
</P>
<P>
   If landing a player with the skills to help revitalize the
Rockets now and build around later weren't complicated and crucial
enough, they will have to do it while juggling their own ample
collection of free agents, especially Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley has said he would return to the Rockets only if the
roster were improved. But another bit of news from Wednesday's
negotiation breakthrough will complicate that. Because he made less
than the league's $2.6 million average, Barkley's last annual
salary will count 300 percent of its worth against the Rockets' $30
million salary cap, or $6.6 million, until he is signed or the
Rockets renounce his rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets already have just under $18 million devoted to their
signed players _ Hakeem Olajuwon, Brent Price, Rodrick Rhodes and
Roy Rogers _ and four draft picks. They would be able to go over
the cap to re-sign their own free agents. But until the Rockets
sign or renounce their free agents, or someone else signs them,
they would not be able to fit McDyess or another similarly
high-dollar free agent under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating things even more is the Rockets' desire to keep
free agents Othella Harrington, Barkley and, under the right
circumstances, Matt Bullard and Matt Maloney.
</P>
<P>
   When Rockets officials work their way through all that,
Tomjanovich will have as little as two weeks of training camp for
his basically new team, including rookies Michael Dickerson, Bryce
Drew, Mirsad Turkcan and Cuttino Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff has worked to put together drills to install
the Rockets' system more quickly. But Tomjanovich has also tinkered
with changes to take advantage of the speed and athleticism of
Dickerson, Rhodes and, he hopes, McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   A shorter season will likely not allow much growth time for a
team suddenly edging toward youth, and a slow start would be hard
to overcome. Olajuwon and Barkley, however, might find a 52-game
season leaves plenty in the tank for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But no one was planning for the playoffs yet. Instead, they were
working for Jan. 18, when the lock is finally taken off the
lockout.

   PHILIP STERLING, 76, ACTOR ON STAGE AND SCREEN
</P>
<P>
   Philip Sterling, an actor whose long career embraced theater,
films, television and radio, died Nov. 30 at the Motion Picture and
Television Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from myelofibrosis, a bone disease,
his publicist said.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling made his Broadway debut in 1955 in the Cole Porter
musical ``Silk Stockings.'' His most prominent role on Broadway was
that of the adulterous father in Neil Simon's 1986 comedy
``Broadway Bound.'' He also appeared in Ron Cowen's ``Summertree''
and in Gore Vidal's ``An Evening With Richard Nixon And . . . ''
playing Dwight D. Eisenhower to George S. Irving's Richard Nixon.
Off-Broadway, he appeared in ``Brecht on Brecht,'' ``In the Matter
of J. Robert Oppenheimer,'' ``The Trojan Women'' and ``Victim of
Duty.'' His most recent stage appearance was in ``Out of
Purgatory'' at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   A serious student of music, he also was narrator of several
concert works, including Schoenberg's ``Survivor from Warsaw'' with
the New York Philharmonic under Pierre Boulez at Lincoln Center in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Among his films were ``Backfire,'' ``The Competition,'' ``The
Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight'' and ``Me, Natalie.''
</P>
<P>
   Sterling began working in television in the days of live comedy
and drama, appearing on ``Studio One'' and ``Kraft Television
Theater.'' He also appeared in ``City of Angels'' and ``Sisters''
and had recurring roles on ``L.A. Law'' and ``St. Elsewhere.'' His
guest appearances were many and various, from ``NYPD Blue'' to
``M.A.S.H.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Philadelphia lawyer, Sterling was the first
president of the Screen Actors Guild Foundation. A graduate of the
University of Pennsylvania and the Wharton School of Business, he
started his career as a jazz pianist before turning to acting.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Rhona; a daughter, Mila of San
Francisco, and a sister, Jane Stern of Holland, Pa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PAUL CORSER, 37, AIDS GROUP OFFICER, 37
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paul Corser, the senior program officer of the
American Foundation for AIDS Research, died Jan. 4 at his home in
Harlem. He was 37. The cause was AIDS-related, his wife, Sally
Morrison, said.
</P>
<P>
   A native of St. Paul, Minn., Corser graduated from New York
University. As program officer, he oversaw the foundation's
grant-making activities and its research, behavioral sciences and
scientific publication projects.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 he developed a clinical trials program, which tests
promising AIDS drugs at neighborhood health centers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Corser is survived by his father,
Bartlett, of Minneapolis; five brothers, Joseph of Bagley, Minn.,
John of New York City, Michael of Guatemala, Patrick of Steamboat
Springs, Colo., and Thomas of Clinton, N.J., and two sisters, Anne
Joria of Houston, Minn., and Elizabeth Ihrke of Plainview, Minn.

NBA DISPUTE ENDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It took 190 days, $500 million in lost player
salaries and a marathon, 11th-hour negotiating session, but NBA
players and owners finally, mercifully ended the most costly labor
war in league history early Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Union director Billy Hunter and commissioner David Stern
negotiated for 12 hours at the league's New York offices,
concluding at 6 a.m. EST and emerging with a draft of a new, six-
to seven-year collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   An overwhelming majority of players ratified the deal hours
later, and the NBA's 29 owners are expected to approve it today,
ending an ugly six-month standoff that nearly killed the entire
season.
</P>
<P>
   Owners originally planned to vote today on Stern's
recommendation to cancel the season and prolong the lockout.
Instead, they will lock in six years of presumed labor peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect the agreement to be ratified by the board of
governors at (today's) meeting,'' Stern said in a prepared
statement. ``I have agreed with Billy Hunter that I will not
discuss the agreement in detail until after its approval by the
board. I will say that I am elated that we will be playing
basketball this season.''
</P>
<P>
   A timeline for resuming league business was not announced, but
the season probably will start the first week of February, and
teams will play a 52-game schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Training camps and roster movement, including the signings of
200 free agents, are on hold pending completion of the deal by
league and union attorneys. However, teams are expected to start
signing players within 7 to 10 days and open training camps by Jan.
18.
</P>
<P>
   A leaguewide gag order on team officials remains in effect,
possibly for another week.
</P>
<P>
   Fans across the country greeted the lockout's end with mixed
emotions, both joy and disgust, and NBA players admitted they have
much work yet to do to restore the league's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no winners in this thing,'' said Detroit's Jerome
Williams. ``We've lost sight of the fact that without the fans, we
and the NBA are nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana guard Fred Hoiberg echoed that sentiment, saying: ``I
don't think anyone won. Both sides lost on it.''
</P>
<P>
   If a winner is to be declared, though, give the nod to Stern and
NBA owners. Although the league did not get the hard salary cap it
sought, the union caved on most major issues, agreeing to absolute
ceilings on individual salaries, longer rookie contracts,
elimination of opt-out clauses and numerous constraints on free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   For many players and agents, there was little to celebrate
except that the lockout is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a victory. This not a tie. It is an overwhelming
loss,'' Los Angeles-based agent Dan Fagen told the Daily News.
``Overall, the deal is just God-awful. It is the worst deal
negotiated by a union in professional sports history, as far as I'm
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagen said Hunter, a former prosecutor and entertainment lawyer
negotiating his first labor deal, was vastly overmatched against
Stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a brain tumor, you go to a brain surgeon, not an
orthopedic surgeon,'' he said. ``Whatever made us capable of
thinking Billy Hunter was capable of handling a ($2 billion)
negotiation ...''
</P>
<P>
   Agent Marc Fleisher said the union conceded too much, too soon
last summer, when it agreed to slash annual salary increases from
20 percent to 10 percent. That began a six-month pattern of union
concessions, with the league making little movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the players to have lost this much money and come away
with a deal this bad is really disheartening,'' Fleisher said.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest economic concession was caps on all player
salaries. Under the new agreement, there won't be any $33 million,
one-year deals like the one Chicago's Michael Jordan had. Jordan
and others over the new limits will have their contracts
grandfathered in, however, with 5 percent annual raises.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, there won't be any more $126 million deals
like the one signed by Minnesota's Kevin Garnett after only two
years in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The players, however, avoided major reductions in their overall
cut of league revenues. Owners wanted to reduce player's percentage
from 57 percent to 52. The agreement instead calls for a reduction
to 55 percent in the final three years, with no limit in the first
three years.
</P>
<P>
   The union also gained new salary-cap exceptions to bolster pay
for the middle-class.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say the deal finally got done because Stern and Hunter
feared what might transpire Wednesday, when 200 players were
scheduled to meet in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting's purpose was to hold a vote on whether to support
union leadership's rejection of Stern's final offer. But dissent
was growing rapidly among the rank-and-file over the union's
decision-making, and the meeting could have been disastrous for the
players' vaunted unity. A split union would surely lose, and some
believed a majority of players might even vote in favor of Stern's
offer, undercutting Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, several players were moving to oust Hunter and
positioning former union president Isiah Thomas to step in,
according to some reports.
</P>
<P>
   But another possible scenario had the players' meeting turning
into a unity-building pep rally. And if players made a final stand
and rejected Stern's offer, the commissioner would have been forced
to either follow through with his threat and cancel the season or
have that threat exposed as a bluff.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Stern and Hunter had ample motivation to hammer out
a deal before the players could meet. With an agreement in hand,
Hunter turned the meeting into a ratification session, and players
voted 174-5 to approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we got everything settled before there was a
free-for-all,'' Houston's Charles Barkley told The New York Times.
``It could have been bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the talk to the contrary, it didn't take long for
fans to flock back to the league. By midday, the Lakers had sold 26
season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone lines are just lit up,'' said sales director Erin
Estrada. ``We sold more (tickets) today than obviously we've sold
in the last few months.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the Forum offices, where employees had started worrying
about layoffs, the mood had become much brighter.
</P>

   ``Just walking up and down the halls, it's a huge sense of

there was a lot of tension. I think everybody just feels a huge

   CHINA-ANOMALY (Nanjie, China) _ In an age often marked by an
economic free-for-all, the village of Nanjie is a dinosaur: its
farm, its factories, its housing are all collectively owned and
managed. Residents must attend regular study sessions of Mao's
teachings, and their take-home pay does not exceed $30 a month.
Nanjie is often cited as a paragon by China's ``leftists.'' But the
very fame of this strange showcase suggests just how anomalous it
is today _ and how far those leftists have fallen. By Erik Eckholm.

inevitably ask whether they have to keep their safety belts

has earned a reputation as a ``nice guy.'' He knows how to listen,
stifles his temper and keeps his word, which is why he swiftly
received the backing of moderate Republicans and conservatives
alike. But, no matter how congenial and hard working, Hastert,
faces a daunting double-barreled challenge: He comes to the job of
speaker as one of the most untested leaders in memory, a no-name
congressman new to the battles of top tier politics, and he
confronts one of the most sharply divided, least forgiving,
Congress' in years. By Lizette Alvarez.

thought of as design on the rocks with a twist. Encased in a rocky
shell, the 2300-square-foot home, which the 58-year-old jeweler and
artist designed for herself in this rugged speck of a railroad town
about 20 miles southeast of Santa Fe, may be the only house in
America whose exterior was architecturally inspired by a
50-foot-long, 14-foot-high polyurethane brontosaurus.

IMMIGRANT DIES IN INS DETENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By MIRTA OJITO   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Dominican immigrant, who for two days complained of
chest pains and a persistent cough, died Monday at a federal
detention center in lower Manhattan without having been examined by
a doctor, fellow detainees and federal officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officers with the Immigration and Naturalization Service in
Washington and New York said the immigrant, who was awaiting
deportation because he had a criminal record, received adequate
medical care from nurses and a doctor's assistant, first in his
dormitory and later in the infirmary.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for detainees who spent time with the man said the
nurses were slow to assess the seriousness of his ailments and
failed to check on him the night before he died.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Miguel Antonio Valoy-Nunez, 40, is the first detainee
to die at the INS detention center on Varick Street in more than a
decade, federal officials said Wednesday. The cause of death has
not been established, pending results of an autopsy performed
Tuesday, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman with the New York City
Medical Examiner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Valoy-Nunez's death came as the INS was under pressure from
human-rights organizations and advocates for immigrants to improve
conditions in detention centers and jails around the country.
Inadequate medical care has been one of the complaints in several
recent reports about the agency's detention practices.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is investigating Valoy-Nunez's death. ``Our standard
procedure says that if there is any indication of foul play in
connection with the death of a detainee, we call the FBI,'' said
Russell Bergeron, an INS spokesman in Washington. ``In this case,
since the cause of death is not known, the FBI was called in.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said Valoy-Nunez died in the infirmary in the
presence of a doctor's assistant who tried to save his life. He
received medical attention from the time of his first complaint,
Saturday afternoon, until he died at 5:30 p.m. Monday, they said.
</P>
<P>
   At least three detainees who were with Valoy-Nunez in the
infirmary for several hours called their lawyers Wednesday to
complain that a man had died because of lack of medical attention.
Matthew Guadagno, an immigration lawyer in lower Manhattan, said
one of his clients told him that he cared for Valoy-Nunez on his
last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``My client said the man was shivering, very cold, coughing up
black stuff and had a very low pulse, and no one came to help,''
Guadagno said.
</P>
<P>
   Bergeron said that Valoy-Nunez, who was never seen by a doctor,
was checked by nurses throughout the night. The infirmary, which is
run by an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services, is
staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Thorn, an INS spokesman in New York, said Valoy-Nunez was
taken to the detention center Dec. 28 from Rikers Island, where he
had been held for seven months on a drug charge.
</P>
<P>
   The day after he died, 33 detainees on Varick Street refused
breakfast and lunch, Thorn said.

AIRBUS ORDER IS BLOW TO BOEING, CLOSE TO HOME
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Wash.) (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Airbus Industrie made further inroads Wednesday against its
archrival, Boeing Co., when Boullioun Aviation Services, a
fast-growing aircraft leasing company founded by a former Boeing
executive, E.H. ``Tex'' Boullioun, announced its first purchase of
Airbus jets.
</P>
<P>
   Boullioun, which is based in Bellevue, Wash., near Boeing's
Seattle headquarters, ordered 30 narrow-body jets in Airbus' A320
family. The deal is worth $1.3 billion at list prices and does not
include an undisclosed number of options Boullioun also secured on
future deliveries of Airbus jets.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolism of the sale was especially sweet for Airbus.
Bouillon, who retired from Boeing in 1986, had at one time been the
head of Boeing's commercial airplane division and is well
remembered as one of the company's best salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Boullioun Aviation, which was bought by Deutsche Bank in
December for $120 million, currently has an all-Boeing fleet of 32
jets. Last summer, it placed orders for 30 narrow-body 737s from
Boeing, and it bought three more of the jets last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is rather gratifying that with a name like Boullioun
Aviation they have gone with Airbus,'' said John Leahy, senior vice
president at Airbus, a European consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Boullioun president and chief executive Robert Genise said the
decision to buy from Airbus was pragmatic. ``We see an increasing
number of airlines that are taking the Airbus family,'' he said.
``It is important for us to be able to offer aircraft to Airbus
operators in addition to Boeing operators.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Boullioun is the latest in a string of
breakthroughs Airbus has made with Boeing customers over the last
year. Last summer, British Airways placed its first order with
Airbus after maintaining an all-Boeing fleet for decades. In
September, United Parcel Service announced that it was buying from
Airbus for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing continues to suffer the fallout from production problems
that have plagued it since late 1997. Though Boeing recently
exceeded its own targets by delivering 191 planes in the last
quarter of 1998, for a total of 559 for the year, it is still
suffering from delays.
</P>
<P>
   Scandinavian Airlines System said Wednesday that deliveries of
its new 737 jets were six to 10 weeks behind schedule. Boeing must
pay penalties for such delays.
</P>
<P>
   SAS has ordered 55 of the new-generation 737s, a commitment
worth an estimated $2 billion. It was supposed to receive 10 new
planes by the end of 1998, but only eight were delivered. Vagn
Soerensen, a senior vice president, said that Boeing had assured
the airline that the delays, which were reported Wednesday in The
Financial Times, would be cleared up by April.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he was uncertain how much compensation the airline
would receive from Boeing, but that the amount would be
``marginal.'' Scott Battishill, a Boeing spokesman, said that the
company had not yet received a request from SAS for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Boullioun said that it expects to begin receiving its new Airbus
planes in early 2002. The company has the right under its order to
buy A319, A320 or A321 planes, which carry 124, 150 and 185
passengers, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   According to Genise, the sale to Deutsche Bank will allow
Boullioun to continue its rapid growth, securing its place as the
third-largest aircraft leasing company, behind International Lease
Finance Corp. and GE Capital Aviation Services.
</P>
<P>
   Tex Boullioun retired from Boullioun's board in 1995 but still
acts as an adviser. Will the old Boeing salesman visit Airbus'
plant in southern France to take delivery of the first jet?
</P>
<P>
   ``Airbus has to invite him,'' Genise said. ``I'm sure he would
be delighted to go.'' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Snowflakes swirled around a weary Patrick Ewing as he
stood outside a toy store in midtown Manhattan on Wednesday. He
slipped a hood over his head, but it might as well have been a
towel after a long night on the court.
</P>
<P>
   He was done. He had led the 430 players on a march that started
when the National Basketball Association lockout began six months
ago. After absorbing criticism for his ill-advised comments and
skepticism over his association with his agent, David Falk, an
agreement to save the season was struck Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   All of his thoughts could now turn to something a little less
taxing: basketball. There will be an air of intrigue surrounding
Ewing _ who has played just four games since season-ending surgery
on his wrist a year ago _ when he leads the Knicks into a
lockout-shortened season of about 50 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a 50-game season, it's still a season,'' Ewing said.
``Hopefully, I can get me a championship in 50 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Same old Ewing. He has cast the Knicks into the title run again.
</P>
<P>
   Several elements will play into the Knicks' potential for such a
chase. Marcus Camby, who has had minimal contact with Ewing and his
new teammates since arriving in a draft-day trade for Charles
Oakley, will have to find his niche with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Several personnel decisions also have to be made within the next
month, the most pivotal of which is at point guard. Although they
will take a quick glance at the free-agent market and trade
possibilities, the Knicks will try to re-sign Charlie Ward during a
flurry of activity. But Ward, who bristled each time the Knicks
dangled his name in trade talks last year, is bound to have offers
from Toronto, Detroit and Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks could land a point guard in a trade. A package deal
consisting of Chris Childs, Chris Mills and John Starks has often
been mentioned as potential bait to land a top backcourt player.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with a short season, the Knicks may opt to remain the
same. Training camps will be abbreviated and teams on which the
players are familiar with one another stand a better chance of
getting off to a good start. Over the past couple of years, the
Knicks have struggled coming out of the gate; a slow start this
year could be detrimental to a playoff bid.
</P>
<P>
   To a considerable degree, the team's fortunes may have to do
with how well the Knicks have stayed in shape during the lockout.
In one of his few remarks during the labor dispute, Knicks Coach
Jeff Van Gundy remarked that the Indiana Pacers had been holding
regular team workouts on their own but that he had not heard any
reports that his players were doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing has admitted that his responsibilities as union president
have limited his workout schedule. He appears to be carrying about
15 to 20 pounds more than he did at the beginning of last season.
Since then, he underwent wrist surgery and has been locked out for
six months. His only real playing time over the last year has been
confined to his return for the playoffs against Indiana last
season, when the Knicks were eliminated in the second round.
Against the Pacers in four games, he shot 20 of 56 (35 percent) and
was disappointed that he could not find his All-Star form on such
short notice.
</P>
<P>
   He is on short notice again. Teams have precious little time to
find their rhythm. But it's a challenge Ewing welcomes after what
he experienced as union president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did my job,'' Ewing said. ``I did everything the guys asked
me to do. I led the best way I could. I was strong when I needed to
be strong. The deal is done, and now it's time to get back to
work.''  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, said
Wednesday night that the Senate was getting ``closer and closer''
to a plan for a full trial of President Clinton that could last
into February and would end with an actual vote on the two articles
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Lott delivered his guardedly optimistic remarks about a plan in
brief encounters with reporters as he went from one negotiating
session to another and then on the Senate floor Wednesday night,
just hours after the 106th Congress convened.
</P>
<P>
   The developments seemed to put an end to any hopes by Democrats
and the White House that the Senate would coalesce around an
earlier bipartisan proposal that would have dispensed with
impeachment within a week without a full trial.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, Lott had told senators that the emerging outline for
the first impeachment trial of a president in 131 years would be
one ``that neither the House nor the White House will just
necessarily think is wonderful but will give all parties a fair
chance to make the case and get to a conclusion that's an equitable
one.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist set to swear in
senators for the trial on Thursday, the two parties remained split
over whether to allow witnesses to testify. House Republicans want
to call anywhere from five to 18 witnesses to testify against
Clinton. Those witnesses could include Monica Lewinsky, Vernon
Jordan, a Clinton confidante and a host of White House aides. But
Democrats have adamantly opposed having witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lott did not specify how this volatile issue would be handled,
calling it one of the ``critical points.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the night, he said, ``I think either side that wants a
witness has to show why, who are they, what they are needed for,
what point is involved, can it be stipulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Several lawmakers said the Senate could control which witnesses
are subpoenaed by taking a vote on whether to allow each one.
</P>
<P>
   ``All sides of this Rubik's cube have been talked about,' Lott
said Wednesday evening. ``We hope to have this all resolved
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   A small bipartisan group of senators worked into the night,
meeting first with the House impeachment managers and then with
White House lawyers, Charles F. C. Ruff and Gregory B. Craig.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, a White House spokesman indicated that
Clinton's lawyers were willing to stipulate to certain evidence in
the case in exchange for an abbreviated trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meeting was constructive and the White House made clear we
were willing to try the case expeditiously based on a stipulated
record without witnesses,'' said James Kennedy, a spokesman for the
White House counsel's office. Kennedy would not elaborate on what
evidence the White House would agree not to contest.
</P>
<P>
   The White House offer represented a concession that it was
unwilling to make during the House impeachment debate. It was not
known whether the senators insisted that witnesses would have to be
called to establish the factual basis of the perjury and
obstruction of justice charges against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear that Democrats would agree with whatever
proposal emerged. Ranit Schmelzer, the spokeswoman for Sen. Tom
Daschle, the minority leader, said Wednesday night that there was
``no deal and no agreement on witnesses. Our position continues to
be, no witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott was also careful not to suggest he had yet found the magic
formula. ``I don't think it's safe to assume anything right now,''
he told reporters, ``so don't be trying to read my body English or
anything else. Nothing is written in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials declined to respond to Lott's brief
evening announcement suggesting a lengthier trial. ``I'm not going
to try to decipher the meaning of that,'' said Joseph Lockhart, the
White House spokesman. ``We will await an announcement of what
their process is before commenting further.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the Capitol, the House looked for a way to soothe the
partisan anger that had engulfed it last month in the final days of
its own impeachment proceedings, which led to near-party line votes
to impeach Clinton. The House elected a new, little-known speaker,
Rep. Dennis Hastert, 57, who appealed for a return to comity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Solutions to problems cannot be found in a pool of
bitterness,'' Hastert said, delivering his first speech as speaker
from the well of the House chamber instead of the imposing
speaker's platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the turbulent days behind us, debate on the merits often
gave way to personal attacks,'' he said. ``Some here have felt
slighted, insulted or ignored. That is wrong, and that will
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert was turned to by shocked Republicans after Newt Gingrich
stepped down under fire and their next choice, Bob Livingston,
abruptly resigned over revelations that he had had extra-marital
affairs. Livingston had toppled Gingrich just one month earlier,
capitalizing on anger that Republicans had lost five House seats in
a midterm election seen as a mandate against impeachment. The
election left them opening the new session Wednesday with a 10-seat
majority, one of the smallest House majorities this century.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House minority leader, called on the new
Congress to ``put to rest finally the poisonous politics that has
infected this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the impeachment of the president dominated a day that is
usually devoted to celebration and hopeful talk of legislative
goals and new party agendas. At times the confluence of events
almost seemed bizarre. At one point in the morning, Lott left a
Republican conference that was heatedly debating the trial of
Clinton to receive a quick greeting from Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Looking tanned, Gore heartily called out New Year's greetings to
reporters waiting word of how impeachment would proceed. As the
presiding officer in the Senate, Gore then swore in the 34 senators
elected or re-elected in 1998.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon, Lott and Daschle also placed a quick phone
call to Clinton to tell him the new session had convened, with Lott
making pleasantries about college football.
</P>
<P>
   For all the talk of a new tone, the House plunged almost
immediately back into the impeachment issue, because of the
requirement that the new Congress reappoint the 13 Republicans that
the 105th Congress selected to prosecute the president in the
Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, the head of the House impeachment team, in a
futile effort to head off the debate, called the measure a ``simple
straightforward housekeeping resolution'' and said it was
``incidental to impeachment.'' He said his group planned to
prosecute the case ``as expeditiously and fairly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the Democrats who had fought against impeachment
from the House Judiciary Committee appealed to the new members of
the House not to cast one of their first votes to facilitate the
trial of the president. Rep. John Conyers Jr., the ranking Democrat
on the committee, said the House had carried out a partisan
impeachment ``totally lacking in credibility and overwhelmingly
rejected by the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``Today we have a final opportunity to put this
salacious activity behind us. If we reject the motion to reappoint
managers we will send a signal that we are prepared to move from
the politics of personal destruction.'' But the managers were
reappointed 223-198 on a near party-line vote, with the same five
Democrats who had supported Clinton's impeachment voting with the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate side of the Capitol, senators searched for a way
to reach a bipartisan plan for a trial that would overcome the
differences between the conservatives' push for witnesses and the
Democrats' opposition to them. It was clear that the bipartisan
proposal that Lott and Daschle had used as a starting point for
negotiations was largely dead. It envisioned a trial without
witnesses lasting about a week and then test votes on whether the
Senate could muster the 67 votes needed to remove Clinton from
office. If, as expected, the Senate did not have the votes, the
trial would have been adjourned. Some senators expected that the
Senate would then consider censure, which many Republicans oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde told Lott in a meeting Wednesday morning that House
prosecutors want to call five to eight witnesses and take two weeks
to make their case against Clinton, Republican senators said. But a
senior House staff member close to the effort said Wednesday night
that managers were looking at a list of 12 to 18 witnesses, from
Ms. Lewinsky to a host of White House aides to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that any witness list that we put together
will include the name of Monica Lewinsky,'' Rep. George Gekas,
R-Penn., one of the House managers, said on CNN. ``But the extent
of what testimony we would elicit from her, that has not been fully
decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans said they wanted to back their colleagues in
the House. ``I would prefer not to have witnesses,'' said Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas. ``But if the House believes they have to have a few
witnesses to make their case, I'm not going to support some
political deal that denies them the ability to make their case.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Democrats took a firm stand against hearing from the
cast of characters who have become familiar to the nation.
Assessing Democratic sentiment, Daschle, the minority leader, said,
``I think it is fair to say that there is universal, unanimous
opposition to witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans spent hours locked away in an ornate floor off the
Senate chamber trying to find a middle ground. Wednesday night they
emerged optimistic. ``It's gelled,'' said Sen. Olympia Snowe,
R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said Republicans wanted an actual vote on articles of
impeachment and not simply the test votes that had been contained
in an earlier compromise proposal for a highly expedited trial. And
in contrast to that plan's one-week timetable, he said that both
the House and White House could end up getting several weeks each
to present their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that takes you to January the 30th or February the 12th,
that's not as important as that you get these things achieved,'' he
said. ``I think everybody agrees to that. Everybody would like to
have it done in a speedy fashion, but only so speedy that it
doesn't cause people to feel like it's being shoved or that they
haven't had a chance to make their case.''
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of senators continued to try to hammer out a
plan in Lott's third-floor hideaway of the Capitol Wednesday night,
negotiating with Hyde and three other House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The group broke up at about 8:30 p.m., with Hyde saying
negotiations would continue. The lawmakers declined to say what if
any progress had been made.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how the negotiations progress, the first impeachment
trial of the president is to begin Thursday morning when Hyde and
the 12 other House managers are invited into the Senate chamber at
10 a.m. There they will read the articles of impeachment charging
Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice. Then the Senate
will notify the chief justice that it is ready to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   At 1 p.m. Rehnquist will be sworn in by the presiding officer of
the Senate. Rehnquist will likely be sworn in by Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., who at 96 is the president pro tem of the Senate
and its oldest member.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist in turn will swear in senators as jurors in the
impeachment trial.

AIRTOUCH NOW TRIES TO PICK THE BEST PARTNER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Representatives of three telecommunications giants
holed up in New York offices Wednesday as negotiators met to
discuss which company would be the best partner for Airtouch
Communications, the nation's largest independent wireless carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, the nation's biggest local telephone company, has
been in talks for weeks to acquire Airtouch for about $45 billion
in stock. But days ago, Vodafone Group P.L.C. of Britain entered
the fray with a proposal to buy Airtouch for stock and cash worth
about $55 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to these companies said there had been no talks
between the chief executives of Vodafone and Airtouch, but midlevel
executives are meeting in New York this week. The discussions
include whether the two companies would be combined as a holding
company and where headquarters would be. Another point of
discussion is whether Vodafone's high earnings multiple could be
sustained with a combined company. And while many analysts think
the company is uninterested in Airtouch's domestic business, the
companies are discussing how Vodafone could expand operations in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One executive said Airtouch investors would be offered about
half an American depository receipt and cash in exchange for each
Airtouch share. But, he warned, the proposal was still preliminary
and the price was flexible. Still, if these meetings go well, the
chief executives could meet as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   One concern though is whether Airtouch's board and management
will disagree on whom to choose as a partner, Vodafone or Bell
Atlantic. ``Vodafone has the edge,'' said Robert Gensler, a
telecommunications analyst at T. Rowe Price. ``Airtouch is reaching
for how Bell Atlantic could structure something as good as
Vodafone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic representatives, who are further along in their
discussions, spent the better part of the day analyzing whether an
acquisition still made sense, as well as trying to figure out
whether Bell Atlantic would be able to use favorable accounting
rules to avoid a large write-off to earnings. ``We don't want to
get in the situation of a battle just to have one,'' a person close
to those talks said.
</P>
<P>
   One investor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he
spoke with Airtouch executives who spent the day polling
institutional investors to see which partner investors would back.
Airtouch executives, he said, are concerned that Vodafone's stock
is too rich and a sharp downturn in the stock market would
jeopardize any combination. Vodafone A.D.R.'s rose $1.625 on
Wednesday to $180.75. That is more than double last January's
52-week low of $68.3125.

STARS' STREAK CONTINUES ON CARBONNEAU'S GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Guy Carbonneau was seething inside. He just wouldn't
let anyone else see it.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' 38-year-old center was chuckling three weeks ago when
teammate Mike Keane beat him out as the last forward to score a
goal on the team this season. But when longtime friend Craig Ludwig
banged home his first tally Dec. 31, Carbonneau's goal drought was
no longer a laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really mad,'' Carbonneau said of the goal that broke
Ludwig's 156-game goal-less streak. ``That put the pressure on
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Carbonneau let loose his anger in the best way. He
scored the game-winner at the 13:11 mark of the third period,
breaking a 44-game goal drought and helping lead the Stars to a 6-4
victory against the Vancouver Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars extend their franchise-best winning streak to 15 games
(12-0-3) _ the best in the NHL this season and the second-best in
the past five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of has legs of its own now,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars move to 25-5-6 on the season, good for a league-best
56 points _ seven points better than the next closest team, the New
Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, they have had to rely on every aspect of team play.
Last night, the Stars had a 3-for-6 night on the power play and
came up with a key goal from Carbonneau.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's timing,'' Hitchcock said. ``If you're going to continue
to play well and win hockey games, you have to have people step up.
We needed it tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau's goal ended a furious shift in which the Stars sent
Canucks goalie Garth Snow flopping about the ice like Flipper. Snow
first stopped tries by Pat Verbeek and Mike Keane _ a seeming
replay of a first period where the Stars frittered away countless
opportunities. But then, Carbonneau pushed hard to the front of the
net and flipped in his 247th career goal to break a 4-4 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was pressure, but you don't want to put too much
pressure on yourself or squeeze your stick too hard,'' Carbonneau
said. ``I knew I was getting chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludwig joked that he saw it a different way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you kidding me, he made up about 12 sticks this morning,''
Ludwig said. ``He was mad. He wanted this.''
</P>
<P>
   So did his teammates. On a night when goalie Ed Belfour
struggled throughout _ ``he looked like Mark Spitz out there
swimming around,'' Hitchcock said _ the Stars rallied from deficits
of 2-0 and 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just told him to shut it down and we'll go out and try to
win this one for you,'' Ludwig said. ``It was our turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shaky performance (16 saves on 20 shots), Belfour
pushed his career-best unbeaten streak to 11 games (8-0-3) and his
overall record to 19-5-4. Among the other superlatives:
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Sydor had a goal and two assists to push himself into the
NHL lead in defenseman scoring (32 points) and power-play scoring
(25).
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' league-best power play has 44 goals, six better than
the second-best New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano had a goal and two assists and has 18 points (six
goals, 12 assists) during the 15-game unbeaten streak.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull extended his team-best goal total to 14.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it was a strange way for the Stars _ who went into the
night as the second-best defensive team in the NHL _ to win a game.
After all, the Canucks (13-22-4) were without holdout winger Pavel
Bure, injured winger Alexander Mogilny (bruised kidney), injured
winger Todd Bertuzzi (broken leg) and injured center Peter Zezel
(broken leg) and had lost their previous six games.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though the Stars found a way to get far behind before
they could finally catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bizarre,'' Hitchcock said. ``But good teams find a way
to win these games.''

LA TIMES TO SWALLOW PAIR OF SUBURBAN PAPERS

   LOS ANGELES _ Separate sales of the Glendale News-Press and the
Burbank Leader will halt Feb. 1, with subscribers being forced to
buy the Los Angeles Times at a much higher price to get the
community newspapers, according to announcements that appeared in
both papers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the arrangement, readers won't be able to get just the
Glendale or Burbank papers delivered to their door; instead, the
papers will be bundled with the Times at a cost of $1 a week more,
according to Times Mirror Corp., the Los Angeles-based parent
company of the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the Foothill Leader, a sister paper of the Glendale
and Burbank publications and also owned by Times Mirror, hasn't
been announced, although closing it remains a possibility, one
Times Mirror executive said. For now, the Foothill paper will be
sold and delivered separately.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News is the newspapers' primary competitor and has
substantial circulation in Burbank and Glendale as well as the
Foothills area.
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror recently made substantial cutbacks at the Los
Angeles Times _ including eliminating some 13percent of its work
force, about 850 jobs _ because of lower-than-expected advertising
revenue. Times Mirror took a $225million charge against earnings to
pay for the reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror's strategy in Glendale and Burbank, which analysts
say is uncommon but not unheard of, raised the concern and ire of
readers, residents and community officials. Many don't like what
are being perceived as strong-arm tactics by a big metropolitan
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a ridiculous setup,'' said Katharine Rickard, a
72-year-old widow in Burbank. ``It just kind of sounds unethical to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Mestel, immediate past president of the Glendale Homeowners
Coordinating Council, said the News-Press is a good paper that
ought to stand on its own. He worked at the Times for 37 years as
an industrial engineer until his retirement, but disagrees with his
former employer's decision regarding his hometown publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``To force people to subscribe and take an additional newspaper
seems objectionable to me,'' Mestel said.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg said the community paper
has provided an independent voice for Glendale for most of this
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of breaks my heart,'' she said. ``It's never going to
be the same. It's kind of like a Pennysaver being tucked into a big
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Bob Keen, a News-Press subscriber for 20 years, ``Glendale
will lose its local newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Kendall, publisher of the Glendale, Burbank and Foothill
papers, said the publications will retain their editorial
independence, even as they share back-office functions such as
delivery. Glendale has about 10,000 subscribers and Burbank has
about 32,000, much of it given away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's providing a complete package to our
readers,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   The move is part of the Times' new regional strategy to
consolidate the news content of the main newspaper while adding
periodical community sections in pockets of the five-county Greater
Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   The paper now provides weekly and in some cases five-day-a-week
Our Times community news inserts in seven areas and will add up to
12 more this year, said Times spokeswoman Laura Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that the Los Angeles Times wants, of course, to
have a guaranteed presence in these towns,'' said Ben Bagdikian,
former dean of journalism at the University of California at
Berkeley and author of ``The Media Monopoly.'' ``In the long run,
it's to the Times' financial advantage to have control.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagdikian speculated that perhaps it's a matter of time before
the Times absorbs the smaller papers and converts them into Our
Times editions. Community news, he said, would be relegated to a
small section and the editorial independence and news coverage of
the former News-Press and Leader would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   But William Lobdell, editor of Times Community News, which
oversees the editorial side of Times Mirror's 17 community papers,
disputed Bagdikian.

NEXT MOVE: CLEANING UP THEIR IMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The NBA players and owners had the golden goose by
the neck and seemed bound and determined to squeeze the last breath
out of it _ even if it meant every ounce of goodwill the league had
generated over the past two decades expired right along with it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end NBA commissioner David Stern had the good sense to
see that it wouldn't have mattered whose fingerprints were at the
scene of the crime. The blame would have been draped like a white
sheet over the league.
</P>
<P>
   Understand this: Stern didn't have to hunker down with the head
of the players' union and scratch out a deal before Wednesday
dawned. He could have let the sun come up and sat back as the storm
clouds gathered wherever it was in New York that the players were
slated to meet for what amounted to a vote of confidence for the
union negotiating committee.
</P>
<P>
   There figured to be at least a few dissenting voices, maybe even
enough to allow Stern and his troops to claim a victory.
</P>
<P>
   But any smug satisfaction Stern and the owners would have
derived, knowing their hardball tactics had indeed cracked the
enemy's armor, would have been ephemeral. Divided, a league built
on stars and buttressed by a well-muscled marketing arm would have
crumbled under the weight of its inertia.
</P>
<P>
   It was getting harder and harder for either side to rally public
opinion as they fought over how to split an estimated $2 billion in
annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, cognizant that the largest casualty of this war could be
the NBA as we know it, extended an olive branch to union director
Billy Hunter. Hunter wisely accepted it and the all-night meeting
that ensued produced a six-year deal that was ratified 179-5
Wednesday afternoon in a vote of roughly half of the union
membership.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is one both sides ought to be able to live with
quite comfortably. The owners got a three-tiered cap for individual
salaries but sacrificed the hard cap they sought via the
dissolution of the so-called ``Larry Bird rule.''
</P>
<P>
   The players, in addition to winning salary exceptions that will
enable a team to sign two additional players every season above and
beyond its salary cap, also won't have a ceiling on revenue
percentages until the fourth year of the deal and then it will be
capped at 55 percent (it was 57 percent this past season).
</P>
<P>
   Rekindling what Stern referred to as the ``spirit of
partnership'' between the owners and the players took six months.
Repairing the frayed alliance between the league and its fans could
take a whole lot longer, especially if Michael Jordan sticks
resolutely to his retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the lockout finally has ended, look for the real
hand-wringing to begin.
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to step up in Jordan's absence and be the he in
hero? The Lakers' Kobe Bryant isn't ready to carry a team much less
a league. And Latrell Sprewell, Chris Webber and Allen Iverson, all
immensely talented players, seem better equipped to carry their
respective teams to the NBA Finals than win any citizenship awards.
</P>
<P>
   We're not going to see the players at their best, at least not
in the early going. But is it too much to ask that they be on their
best behavior? It's a crime that the fans were cheated out of half
the 1998-99 season. Hopefully the players will have the good sense
not to blithely add to the rap sheet by running afoul of the law.
</P>
<P>
   At this critical juncture, a little professionalism would go a
long way. Any player who blows off an autograph seeker should be
made to write down the entire collective bargaining agreement as
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth remembering that even before the lockout gave the
NBA a black eye, its image was taking a public beating. There was a
growing perception that the ingrates were running (and ruining) the
game.
</P>
<P>
   This past season found players being indicted on drug charges
and pleading guilty to child endangerment charges and generally
behaving in such a way that at least one general manager felt
compelled to apologize to his team's fans.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly killing the season, it wouldn't hurt the players
and owners to kill their fans with kindness.
</P>
<P>
   On the homefront, Clippers owner Donald Sterling could engender
goodwill by boldly choosing as the franchise's next head coach,
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (who better than Abdul-Jabbar to bring along
the Clippers' No. 1 draft choice, Michael Olowokandi?).
</P>
<P>
   The word is Lakers executive Jerry West might be looking for a
new head coach in a few months. Then again, maybe he won't be so
quick to dismiss Del Harris, who is in the final year of his
contract, after observing what Harris is capable of doing without
Nick Van Exel and Elden Campbell digging into his side like thorns.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell is sure to be gone by the time the shortened season
begins. The question is, how many fans will care enough to notice?
</P>
<P>
   Counting the empty seats in NBA arenas will be one way of adding
up the cost of the lockout. Which means that for ushers and food
vendors and parking lot attendants and other such innocent victims
of the players' and owners' power trip, it's all over but the final
accounting.

NEW `KIDS' ON BLOCK PUSH BACK  
 CARDS' OFFENSIVE LINE TURNS AROUND IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
 LINE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lomas Brown remembers how unpopular the Cardinals' offensive
linemen used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of guys went to the front of a club to try to get
in,'' Brown said. ``They said who they were. The (bouncer) pointed
to the back of the line.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's when the line was giving up an NFL-high 78 sacks and
blocking for a running game that averaged only 78 yards per game
last season, also a league worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we get complimented wherever we go around town,'' Brown
said. ``So, it's completely different. Everyone is wearing
(Cardinals) gear. I even got in someplace free the other day.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line has helped the Cardinals reach the second
round of the NFC playoffs. They play top-seeded Minnesota Sunday at
the Metrodome in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The line cut down its sacks to 50 and helped the offense improve
from 24th overall last year to 13th this season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the linemen are celebrating their new fame by wearing
T-shirts given to them by their position coach, George Warhop. The
shirts say, ``78 Club is Dead. Go Big Red.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worn mine out,'' center Aaron Graham said. ``I had to put
it in the laundry to get washed.''
</P>
<P>
   The line became the `78 Club'' at training camp when Warhop
wrote those words on the blackboard in Flagstaff. He asked the
linemen at a team meeting if they knew what it meant.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Chris Dishman joked that the ``78 Club'' was when Brown
graduated. But it wasn't a laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   The linemen knew most experts thought it was the weakest
position on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd see grades in the magazine and it would be an `F,' or
the lowest grade ever recorded,'' Dishman said. ``It was a big slap
in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst thing the linemen read about themselves was in
``Athlon'' pro football preview. The magazine wrote, ``There is no
delicate way to describe how (the line) played last year.
Basically, they stunk. . . . This team doesn't seem to have done
much in the off-season to upgrade the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism of the line seemed justified when the Cardinals
gave up seven sacks in their second game, a 33-14 loss at Seattle.
Then, the following week, the line gave up five in a 17-3 victory
over Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson, team vice president-player personnel, defended the
group. He guaranteed the line would be much improved this season
and said to ``put it on me'' if it weren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot of guts for him to say that,'' Graham said.
``I'm proud that he did it, saying he had a lot of faith in us and
didn't look at us as an inadequate offensive line.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said he didn't put the onus on himself to try to take
the pressure off the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't play games like that,'' he said. ``I believed in time
that they'd get better. They've improved, and I knew they would.
You don't have to be the most talented players to win
championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said the 34-year-old Warhop, in his first year in
charge of an NFL offensive line, has done a ``magnificent job'' of
meshing ``new and inexperienced people and a new system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the numbers,'' Ferguson said. ``They didn't give up a
sack last week against our most-feared enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   The line didn't allow a sack in last week's NFC wild-card
victory over Dallas, the second time in three weeks it didn't give
up a sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he has handled the young and the old guys is very
impressive,'' Devlin said. ``He lets everybody have input. He's a
fired-up guy who is not going to make you think you can't play. He
points out mistakes, but he's teaching you and trying to make you
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Warhop deflects the praise. ``It's not me,'' Warhop said. ``It's
not just the line that has progressed, either. The whole offense
has progressed.''
</P>
<P>
   He is referring to the emergence of running back Adrian Murrell,
a 1,000-yard rusher, and the development of quarterback Jake
Plummer, who has thrown for 2,515 yards and 11 touchdowns in the
past eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had a young quarterback,'' Warhop said. ``As he got
better, we'd all get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the criticism of the line stemmed from the team doing
little in the off-season to improve it. The only free-agent lineman
the Cardinals added was right guard Lester Holmes. Massive tackle
Anthony Clement was drafted in the second round, but he has missed
nearly all of the season because of a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   The line entered the season with four new starters _ right
tackle James Dexter, Holmes, Graham and Dishman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just improved each week,'' Dexter said. ``It's like
(backup center) Mike Devlin said, `Climb that ladder,' and we have.
We've just given (Murrell) holes to run and Jake time to throw.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Plummer had a 59-yard completion and Murrell had a
74-yard run, both season bests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone else but us threw in the towel and said we weren't
worth a damn,'' Dishman said. ``We knew what we had.'' &QL;

BUSINESS AS USUAL: UCONN TOPS BC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The scoreboard reflected a 13-point loss. It could've
been worse, much worse. But because the Boston College men's
basketball team submitted what coach Al Skinner termed ``clearly
the best 40 minutes of basketball we've played all year,''
Wednesday night's 91-78 loss to No. 1 Connecticut before 8,606 fans
at Conte Forum felt more like a moral victory and less like the
Eagles' 20th consecutive loss to the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that. Just when it appeared the lowly Eagles, installed
as 21-point underdogs, were on the verge of absorbing their worst
spanking of the season, they responded with their most inspired
effort, only to have it go for naught in yet another loss to UConn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about it,'' said Skinner, ``is if you take the
second half of the Seton Hall game (when BC scored 43 points in a
79-63 loss at East Rutherford, N.J., Dec. 30) and you take this
game, we've made some huge strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't ask anything more of my guys than the effort they gave
and the way they competed,'' he added. ``That's what we have to do
just to stay competitive (in the Big East) at this point in time.''
</P>
<P>
   BC forwards Michael Cotton and Kenny Harley combined for 36
points, Cotton leading the way with 23 points and 12 rebounds, both
career highs. Harley chipped in 13 points, including a timely
3-pointer in the first half that pulled BC within 6, 28-22.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen Kenny Walls and Willie Deane came off the bench to
contribute 15 and 13 points, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't enough for the Eagles (3-9 overall, 0-4 league) to
overcome the career night of UConn junior swingman Richard
Hamilton, who led the Huskies (12-0, 4-0) with a game-high 39
points on 14-for-19 shooting from the field, including 5 for 5 from
3-point range. It surpassed his previous career high (38), which
also came on the Conte Forum hardwood in UConn's 80-68 victory over
BC last Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just likes Boston,'' Skinner surmised. ``He likes this gym.
He came in here last year and got some numbers the same way. I
think you need to ask him what it is (about playing at Conte) and
come back and tell me so we can change some things, but he's had
some fine nights here.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Rip, what about it? ``I don't know what it is,'' Hamilton
said with a smile. ``I just like it here.''
</P>
<P>
   The only blemish on Hamilton's line in the final box was his
seven turnovers. ``He's a good player and he can't do that,'' said
UConn coach Jim Calhoun. ``He's a better player than he showed, and
I want him to be able to make more plays.''
</P>
<P>
   After helping UConn streak to a 16-2 lead, Hamilton did
precisely that to give the Huskies a 48-39 halftime lead, scoring
their only two field goals in the final 4:31 before intermission.
</P>
<P>
   After Khalid El-Amin drilled a trey and scored on an offensive
tip-in to start the second half, Hamilton scored on a foul-inducing
drive and stuck a jumper between a pair of dunks by Edmund Saunders
to lift the Huskies to a 62-43 lead with 16:22 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought BC came out and played with a lot of heart,''
Hamilton said. ``They didn't say, `OK, you're the No. 1 team in the
nation, so go ahead and roll over us.' They played hard and played
scrappy.''
</P>
<P>
   After Hamilton nailed a trey and followed with a jumper to give
UConn a 69-52 lead, Harley reciprocated with a 3-pointer and
Clinton Sims and Walls scored on offensive put-backs that twice
pulled BC within 13 (70-57 and 72-59).
</P>
<P>
   Both teams lapsed into a two-minute drought, which El-Amin
finally snapped with a jumper with 7:48 remaining. Hamilton put the
game out of reach when he drilled yet another trey and followed
with another jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want us to settle for this, but you've got to take
some satisfaction in that we've raised our level of play and set a
standard for ourselves,'' Skinner said. ``Hopefully, we can
continue to work this hard and maintain it.''

SUNS LOSE FLEXIBILITY IN DEAL  
 RULES IMPROVE ODDS OF KEEPING MCDYESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Suns still may raid the Chicago Bulls, but it probably isn't
going to be for forward Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   Even Minnesota forward Tom Gugliotta looks like a long shot
based on the new collective bargaining agreement hammered out
between the NBA and its players on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After positioning themselves for the past two years to have the
flexibility to go after a major free agent, or maybe even two, the
Suns are likely to find themselves severely limited by the new
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Pippen, the Suns may only have enough money available
under the new rules to sign a player such as Chicago center Luc
Longley.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement also appears to give the Suns a big advantage
in their efforts to keep forward Antonio McDyess from defecting to
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you talk about Jerry and Bryan Colangelo, you have to
think somehow, some way, they're going to put a team out there that
can compete for the championship,'' Suns guard Jason Kidd said of
the Suns president and the general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the agreement are still sketchy, and Suns officials
would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   But based on the particulars of the owners' last proposal and
information gleaned from NBA sources, the Suns and other clubs that
hoped to free up considerable salary cap space for free agents will
have to take another look at their blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns may be better off keeping much of last season's team,
plugging in a good big man such as Longley, adding a second-tier
free agent with a new salary cap exception that has been added in
the new deal, and then filling out the roster with young,
developing players.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have five players under contract _ Danny Manning, Jason
Kidd, Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells. Muursepp and
Wells were part of the Steve Nash deal with Dallas. They also have
a first-round draft pick, forward Pat Garrity, and a
second-rounder, guard Toby Bailey, from trades. Bailey doesn't
count against the salary cap as a second-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   The team then has several free agents that it must re-sign or
renounce, including three key players _ McDyess, Rex Chapman and
Clifford Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   That's where it really gets tricky. All but Robinson, if not
renounced, count against the cap at 200 percent of their salaries
last season instead of 150 percent, as under the previous
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, McDyess would have counted $4.3 million against
the cap under the old rules. He now counts about $5.75 million
unless he signs with another team.
</P>
<P>
   The Larry Bird exception, although modified, still exists, and
under the new rules, the Suns are in a good position to keep
McDyess. As a Bird free agent, he can get a seven-year deal from
the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   He can get only a six-year deal from Houston or any other team.
The Suns can give him 12.5 percent annual increases from a base
salary of $9 million under the new rules. Other teams can give him
only 10 percent increases.
</P>
<P>
   Another salary cap charge that has been added is for players
whose rights are renounced. Assuming the Suns kept their five
contract players and their key free agents, and sign Garrity, they
would have three roster spots remaining.
</P>
<P>
   If they chose to renounce their remaining free agents _ such as
Kevin Johnson, John ``Hot Rod'' Williams, Marko Milic, Horacio
Llamas, Loren Meyer and George McCloud _ the Suns still would be
charged $300,000 against the cap for each remaining open roster
spot _ a $900,000 cap charge.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the projected number for this season's salary cap was
supposed to be $31 million. According to reports, the new number
actually will be $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring the five Suns under contract, the free agents the club
will try to re-sign, plus the charge for the other roster spots,
about $25 million of that $30 million would be eaten up.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen probably wouldn't come to Phoenix for a contract that
starts at $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Colangelos will have some tough decisions, especially on
Robinson. If the club keeps him, it would eat up more cap space.
</P>
<P>
   Re-signing McDyess is likely to be the top priority, but if he
signs elsewhere, it would more than double the available cap space,
and the Suns likely would go after one of the other high-profile
players.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement includes a new ``median'' salary exception,
which starts at $1.75 million and eventually will be worth the
league average salary.
</P>
<P>
   With almost 200 free agents available, there will be some
bargains. A player such as the Lakers' Rick Fox or Miami's Brent
Barry might slip through the cracks, as Robinson did before last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, too, that the rest of the league is working under
the same restrictions the Suns now face, and the Phoenix franchise
has a history of being creative in these situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Bryan has his calculator out, and he's gone through
all the scenarios,'' Kidd said. &QL;

FOR MOST, THERE'S NOT MUCH LEFT TO LOVE ABOUT GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA is back. The principals in the labor dispute which ended
Wednesday were admittedly weary from the six-month process, which
featured more body slams than a WWF match between Dennis Rodman and
Karl Malone. They also were contrite that things got so dark toward
the end.
</P>
<P>
   But the NBA is back. Each admission and apology by players,
owners and NBA execs Wednesday, the day before the league was
prepared to Drop Dead, included some of the faux enthusiasm that
permeates sports at times like this.
</P>
<P>
   Half a season wasn't lost, one player said, half a season was
saved. The games will go on. A champion will be crowned. The names
and faces you've enjoyed will return to the court. This pause was
just business. The NBA is back, and we're still Fan-tastic, right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Why should anyone care that you're back?
</P>
<P>
   The morale of this particular labor action differs from those in
the past, and the fallout may be much different.
</P>
<P>
   When football went on strike in 1987, fans were angry. Three
weeks of replacement players turned that anger into laughter, and
motivated the league to find some kind of peace. More than a decade
later, the NFL enjoys the best labor relationship in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball fans still harbor anger and resentment over the 1994
strike that killed a World Series. As remarkable as the 1998 season
was, it took only a month of fiscal free-agent insanity to remind
fans how absurd baseball can become.
</P>
<P>
   I'd estimated that 65 percent of all NBA fans tuned the lockout
out. They're the lucky ones. The remaining 35 percent who took the
time to look at the proposals were likely dumbfounded to learn
their heroes were morons.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA players weren't fighting collusion, an action which gave
merit to baseball's labor war. The NBA players weren't fighting for
free agency, which was at the root of football's problems. The
players and owners were fighting over percentages of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   No one was going to leave the negotiating table hungry. The
owners were merely trying to cap the runaway nature of salaries.
Yes, they should do that on their own. Yes, owners are not to be
trusted, because they might find a way to shield revenue. Yes, the
idiot owners who gave six-figure salaries to Juwan Howard and Shawn
Kemp deserve to lose money.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line always was the same _ it was a fight for
revenue. It was 55 percent of the revenue versus 58 percent of the
revenue. It was five years versus six years for salary barriers.
</P>
<P>
   No careers were in jeopardy. Kobe Bryant wasn't going to look at
the projections and decide he can make more money playing in
Barcelona. None of the highest-paid players will have to sell part
of their automotive fleet or fire a member of their posse.
</P>
<P>
   When you realize that, there's no reason to care whether or not
the league came back. This match was greed versus greed, made worse
by the presence of agents, the ultimate bloodsuckers, acting in the
``best interests'' of their clients, and, of course, their own
3-to-6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (Perhaps the most unintentionally hilarious moment of the
lockout came courtesy of these agents, who said there were
billionaires lined up ready to start a new league with the cream of
the NBA crop. Sure. There are billionaires everywhere bidding to
take over salary payments to Kevin Garnett and, of course, sustain
the lifestyle of agents David Falk and Arn Tellem.)
</P>
<P>
   Any NBA fan who has ever gone through a real labor dispute, the
kind where cost-of-living increases are hammered out, where
corporate downsizing is feared, where health care, pension
contributions and grievance procedures are important, has every
right to tell the NBA to go jam its labor contract.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it's not like the NBA had a bullish future going into the
lockout. There are a dozen examples that the league crested in
popularity several years ago and that its future is murky.
</P>
<P>
   The league was in serious trouble in the late '70s, with a weak
TV contract and a lot of drug use. Its revival came courtesy of
Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, to the degree that current players
should be grateful to their old-time religion.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan has single-handedly carried it through the '90s,
and he has maybe one last hurrah left before he becomes a full-time
father and golfer. There's no heir to the Air, either, and anyone
offering an example is just plain wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As of 1999, the TV contract is strong, but everything else is
suspect. Several franchises are floundering. Seven of 29 teams last
season posted win totals of 27, 20, 19, 19, 17, 16 and 11. Ticket
prices are out of control, testing the conviction of the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the best young players have very little respect for the
product. More than a few have more attitude than game. And the
NBA's off-court baggage of '99 reminds one of the NBA of '79 drug
use, paternity suits, players attacking coaches, players attacking
fans.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA went from the heap to the top in 20 years, and now
appears to be on its way back down.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the end of the lockout is bad news. Maybe everyone needed
a full year off to take stock of what it has and what it needs.
They may be back, but very little is Fan-tastic.

FINDING COACH A TOP PRIORITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that mouthpiece-to-mouthpiece negotiations have resuscitated
the NBA, it's time to check the pulse of the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   There is good news: they begin the forthcoming avalanche of
deals with 10 players under contract.
</P>
<P>
   And there are some surprising similarities _ OK, one similarity
_ between the defenders of the Sports Arena and the Chicago Bulls,
who will defend three consecutive NBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls haven't officially declared the name of their coach.
They've hired Tim Floyd, and he figures to be named head coach as
soon as Phil Jackson ignores the latest half-hearted pleas to
return and choreograph the empire.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers have adopted a comparable strategy. The team is
expected to hire Jim Brewer as Bill Fitch's replacement. Brewer,
who was hired as Fitch's assistant four seasons back, is considered
the favorite over fired Milwaukee Bucks coach Chris Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Given the NBA's compacted training-camp schedule and his
familiarity with the current roster, conventional wisdom would
favor Brewer.
</P>
<P>
   The team's first priority, once the coaching issue is settled,
is Michael Olowokandi, selected by the Clippers with the first pick
in the 1998 NBA Draft. Three days ago, the 7-foot-1 center from the
University of Pacific signed a contract with Kinder Bologna of the
Euro League. The deal, as it has been presented by agent Bill
Duffy, has a unique clause that will allow Olowokandi to escape to
the United States and play for the Clippers... but not until Feb.
15. While playing in Europe for a month and change, conflicting
reports list his expected earnings at either $600,000 or $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi is scheduled to begin his pro career tonight when
Kinder Bologna meets PAOK Salonica of Greece in the historically
rough-and-tumble Euro League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The next Clippers priority would appear to be the backcourt,
specifically point guard. Former UCLA star Darrick Martin occupied
the position last season, after which his contract expired. If the
team attempts to bring in two point guards, Martin is a potential
candidate for re-signing. If the Clippers shop for only one
playmaker, Martin is not expected to be that guy.
</P>
<P>
   Loy Vaught, an eight-year Clippers power forward, also is a free
agent and not expected to return. Vaught, a franchise favorite for
several years, missed last season with a back injury. He reportedly
is as fit as a fiddle now, but the team appears to be in great
shape at the ``four'' spot without him. Possible destinations for
Vaught include New York, New Jersey or Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent center Ike Austin, acquired by the Clippers from
Miami last season in a deal that sent Brent Barry to the Heat,
figures to seek employment elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 Clippers under contract are point guard Pooh Richardson,
combo guard James Robinson, ``two' guard Charles Smith, swingmen
Lamond Murray and Eric Piatkowski, forwards Rodney Rogers, Maurice
Taylor and Lorenzen Wright, and centers Keith Closs and Stokjo
Vrankovic.

FERRARO OUT 4-6 WEEKS WITH INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Kings' injury woes continued Wednesday with the
news that veteran center Ray Ferraro tore cartilage in his right
knee during Tuesday night's 4-3 overtime victory in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, who had seven points in his past eight games, tore the
lateral meniscus cartilage in his right knee when he was checked in
the first period, and is scheduled to undergo surgery Tuesday. The
34-year-old Ferraro, plagued last season by injuries to his left
knee, is expected to be sidelined for four to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (14-21-3) now have lost more games to injuries (170)
through 38 games this season than they did in the entire 82-game
schedule a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, they have won a season-high four consecutive games
_ and six of their last seven _ entering tonight's meeting at the
Forum with the Buffalo Sabres.

BUSINESS AS USUAL: UCONN TOPS BC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The scoreboard reflected a 13-point loss. It could've
been worse, much worse. But because the Boston College men's
basketball team submitted what coach Al Skinner termed ``clearly
the best 40 minutes of basketball we've played all year,''
Wednesday night's 91-78 loss to No. 1 Connecticut before 8,606 fans
at Conte Forum felt more like a moral victory and less like the
Eagles' 20th consecutive loss to the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that. Just when it appeared the lowly Eagles, installed
as 21-point underdogs, were on the verge of absorbing their worst
spanking of the season, they responded with their most inspired
effort, only to have it go for naught in yet another loss to UConn.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about it,'' said Skinner, ``is if you take the
second half of the Seton Hall game (when BC scored 43 points in a
79-63 loss at East Rutherford, N.J., Dec. 30) and you take this
game, we've made some huge strides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't ask anything more of my guys than the effort they gave
and the way they competed,'' he added. ``That's what we have to do
just to stay competitive (in the Big East) at this point in time.''
</P>
<P>
   BC forwards Michael Cotton and Kenny Harley combined for 36
points, Cotton leading the way with 23 points and 12 rebounds, both
career highs. Harley chipped in 13 points, including a timely
3-pointer in the first half that pulled BC within 6, 28-22.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen Kenny Walls and Willie Deane came off the bench to
contribute 15 and 13 points, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't enough for the Eagles (3-9 overall, 0-4 league) to
overcome the career night of UConn junior swingman Richard
Hamilton, who led the Huskies (12-0, 4-0) with a game-high 39
points on 14-for-19 shooting from the field, including 5 for 5 from
3-point range. It surpassed his previous career high (38), which
also came on the Conte Forum hardwood in UConn's 80-68 victory over
BC last Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just likes Boston,'' Skinner surmised. ``He likes this gym.
He came in here last year and got some numbers the same way. I
think you need to ask him what it is (about playing at Conte) and
come back and tell me so we can change some things, but he's had
some fine nights here.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Rip, what about it? ``I don't know what it is,'' Hamilton
said with a smile. ``I just like it here.''
</P>
<P>
   The only blemish on Hamilton's line in the final box was his
seven turnovers. ``He's a good player and he can't do that,'' said
UConn coach Jim Calhoun. ``He's a better player than he showed, and
I want him to be able to make more plays.''
</P>
<P>
   After helping UConn streak to a 16-2 lead, Hamilton did
precisely that to give the Huskies a 48-39 halftime lead, scoring
their only two field goals in the final 4:31 before intermission.
</P>
<P>
   After Khalid El-Amin drilled a trey and scored on an offensive
tip-in to start the second half, Hamilton scored on a foul-inducing
drive and stuck a jumper between a pair of dunks by Edmund Saunders
to lift the Huskies to a 62-43 lead with 16:22 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought BC came out and played with a lot of heart,''
Hamilton said. ``They didn't say, `OK, you're the No. 1 team in the
nation, so go ahead and roll over us.' They played hard and played
scrappy.''
</P>
<P>
   After Hamilton nailed a trey and followed with a jumper to give
UConn a 69-52 lead, Harley reciprocated with a 3-pointer and
Clinton Sims and Walls scored on offensive put-backs that twice
pulled BC within 13 (70-57 and 72-59).
</P>
<P>
   Both teams lapsed into a two-minute drought, which El-Amin
finally snapped with a jumper with 7:48 remaining. Hamilton put the
game out of reach when he drilled yet another trey and followed
with another jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want us to settle for this, but you've got to take
some satisfaction in that we've raised our level of play and set a
standard for ourselves,'' Skinner said. ``Hopefully, we can
continue to work this hard and maintain it.''

EXORCIST, ROBED MATES MEET MATCH IN TROUBLE-PLAGUED TUG

<P>
   NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. _ Let's give the devil his due. The S.S.
Michigan has had trouble, serious trouble. So much so that some
might think it was possessed.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Bill Kelly and his wife, Gay Wassall-Kelly, knew the
score about the Michigan before they ever bought the stubby
mackerel boat, which was built in the 1940s and then converted to a
miniature tugboat. In its 50-odd years, it has sunk nine times,
caught fire and had its hull stove in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we took her out, we had problems, something always
happened,'' said Wassall-Kelly, who, with her husband, lives
dockside in Newport Harbor, about 40 miles south of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   If you doubt the Michigan is hell-bent on being hell-born,
consider:
</P>
<P>
   _It was mired in muck and submerged by its fifth birthday, and
sat on the bottom throughout the late 1940s and early '50s.
</P>
<P>
   _It once sank after being hit with a can of beer fired from a
cannon during a boat parade.
</P>
<P>
   _After being fitted with a fiberglass bottom to help keep it
afloat, the Michigan promptly popped out of the fiberglass and sank
again.
</P>
<P>
   _Lloyds of London, the maritime insurer that routinely issues
policies for freighters in wartime, is said to have refused
coverage for the Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Michigan has had so many problems and spent so much
time stranded at every dock in Newport Harbor that it became a
status symbol to have it break down near your pier.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Rev. Joe Warren, federally licensed sea captain,
ordained minister and boat exorcist.
</P>
<P>
   While Warren would much rather officiate weddings at sea _ his
first calling _ than ridding boats of demons, as he sees it, it's a
job that has to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been recognized for centuries that Jonahs have been
aboard vessels,'' said Warren, who's from Newport Beach. ``Both
ethereal and physical beings can cause a great deal of havoc aboard
ships at sea. We see things from a traditional prospective, not a
scientific one.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren, a mixture of Jimmy Buffett and Jimmy Swaggart, Tom
Selleck and Thomas Aquinas, with a touch of Father Guido Sarducci
for good measure, is not quick to put a vessel through the ordeal
of exorcism. To date, he has had to perform only three.
</P>
<P>
   According to Warren, who has been ministering to the Michigan
since early November, the root of the problem is simple _ the
confused soul of a dead Norwegian fisherman.
</P>
<P>
   The man had died at sea and instead of going toward the light,
his spirit returned to his old boat, his place of greatest comfort,
to do mischief, Warren claims.
</P>
<P>
   When he's got a possession on his hands, Father Warren turns to
a pair of divining rods to locate the spirit. On the Michigan, the
evil dwelled in a spot on the starboard side of its deckhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Warren keeps a Torah-like scroll in an ark and otherwise
conducts a simple service involving ritual confession once a week,
after which a bottle of sacramental wine is given to the celebrant
who unburdens the most shameful confession.
</P>
<P>
   The exorcism aboard the Michigan started off unassumingly
enough. With great ceremony, Warren ignited a small can of Sterno,
picked up two small divining rods and reaffirmed the center of the
evil. His apprentices, Brothers John Hammond and Johnny O'Connell,
huddled around the offending side of the Michigan's wheelhouse.
``The Michigan is filled with seething evil!'' Warren bellowed,
raising his arms in defiance and righteous indignation.
</P>
<P>
   The chants and litany of Warren's apprentices pierced the
tranquility of the quiet dockside neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON 2ND TAKE) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Then Warren read from ``The Expulsion of Demonic Forces from
Vessels,'' a text he himself wrote. Incense was burned in censers.
A small miracle was performed as Warren turned Newport Harbor water
_ some of the filthiest water south of Marina del Rey _ into a
purified state. In an act that was nothing less than, well, icky,
Brother Hammond vomited into a font in an effort to purge the
demons that had been transferred from the boat to his body. Warren
nearly singed his eyebrows in a flameout and the ceremony was
basically over.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Michigan will stay afloat remains to be seen, but,
even if it does, the exorcist has his detractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as haunted houses or haunted boats,''
said Dr. Michael Shermer, author of ``Why People Believe Weird
Things'' and editor at Altadena, Calif.-based Skeptic Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does one boat have more trouble than another? Why are some
cars lemons? We are storytelling, pattern-seeking animals that try
to interpret our environment and explain it,'' Shermer said.
``Whenever there's a gap in our knowledge, we attempt to explain it
by summoning forth supernatural forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Summoning such forces may not have been exactly what Warren's
mother, an Italian immigrant, was hoping for when she prayed that
one of her three sons would become a priest.
</P>
<P>
   After a stint at the University of San Francisco, Warren moved
to Southern California and founded the Order of the Brothers of the
Riverboat Angela Louise. It is a nondenominational ministry, though
it is not without ``certain Catholic spikes,'' as Warren puts it.
</P>
<P>
   He got started exorcising demons from vessels after trouble
began brewing on his own boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Angela Louise had a powerful mojo going on,'' said Warren.
``A mojo is an icon that contains strong magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I bought her, I had to transit her from Shelter Island
(in San Diego) to Newport Harbor. The journey was beset by incident
after incident _ electrical, machinery, fuel, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the problems were of a demonic nature. I knew full well
I was taking the vessel away from her home, where she had been for
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a rosary aboard that had belonged to the owner's
mother. (It) was originally there for good luck,'' Warren said.
But, for him, it was a bad omen.
</P>
<P>
   He cast the rosary into the sea, an act he felt would cleanse
the vessel. He also renamed the craft, which is always dangerous
from a spiritual standpoint. He then installed his own good mojos.
One of which was his mother's St. Christopher medal.
</P>
<P>
   So, does it work? Are all of his clients convinced their boats
have become demon-free?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, they are completely satisfied with the outcome of
the exorcisms,'' said Warren, who performs the rite in return for a
donation, which is loosely based on the afflicted boat owner's
ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee it from repossession _ unless, of course, there's
a lien on the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Michigan) is riding about 4 inches higher in the water,''
said Bill Kelly, cautiously optimistic over the result.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics may have their doubts, but when a boat sinks at the
drop of a dime, the truth may lie somewhere between the devil and
the deep blue sea.

FISHING-BAN PROPOSAL ENTERING NEXT CHAPTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The final chapter of a controversial proposal to ban
fishing along portions of the six northernmost Channel Islands will
not be written immediately.
</P>
<P>
   During its monthly meeting, the Fish and Game Commission on
Wednesday chose not to address the specific proposal but rather to
work more aggressively to develop a comprehensive policy that would
govern any such proposals in the future, said commission executive
director Bob Treanor.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time since April _ when the state agency that
decides such issues initially heard from the proposers _ that the
commission considered the pitch as an action item. No vote was
taken; it is uncertain when the commission will again consider the
Channel Islands fishing-ban proposal. The commission next meets
Feb. 4-5 in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is designed to relieve fishing pressure by
prohibiting all commercial harvesting and recreational angling
along no less than 20 percent of the shorelines of Anacapa, Santa
Cruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel, Santa Barbara and San Nicolas islands
and out to 1 nautical mile. All but San Nicolas Island are found
within the Channel Islands National Park, where fishing regulations
are enforced by the state Department of Fish and Game. ``No take''
or ``no harvest'' marine reserves would be established if the
proposal is approved.
</P>
<P>
   All factions involved agree this is a difficult issue, but the
Fish and Game Commission is committed to taking some action to
restore depleted fishing stocks at the islands just the same. The
problem is, no other options have been presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to try something, and if the no-take zone is the only
thing to try, then we have two choices _ try it or ignore the
problem,'' commissioner Frank Boren said earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frustration with the commissioners is that we are hopeful
that the (fishing) industry and its leaders ... will come forward
and take a long-range view and tell us what are the other options
to make the fisheries sustainable in the long term,'' Boren said.
``And it's not just the fishermen. We haven't seen the Department
(of Fish and Game) come up with new ideas. And the federal
government hasn't come up with anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need leadership. We need to have everybody involved agree
that we can't ignore the problem. All I have heard is that we need
more study; nobody wants to take responsibility. And we need
everybody to take responsibility for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission last heard the proposal in October, and, at that
time, noted it would gather and assimilate data for six months.
</P>
<P>
   It takes 90 days after an approval of such a ban for new
regulations to be enacted, according to DFG officials. Boating,
diving, swimming and other forms of recreation, as well as
educational activities, would not be impacted.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was initiated last year by two separate entities _
the Channel Islands National Park and the Channel Islands Marine
Resource Restoration Committee, a citizen's panel composed of about
20 anglers, environmentalists, scientists and other concerned
residents of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.
</P>
<P>
   The petitioners base their arguments on what most marine
biologists refer to as the Theory of 20s: By the year 2020, 20
percent of the world's fisheries must be protected from angling to
produce their maximum sustainable yield.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``When fisheries dip below 20 percent of a natural
population then they have a very difficult time recovering from
natural extreme events, like El Nino,'' said Gary Davis, senior
biologist at Channel Islands National Park. Hence the proposal to
ban all fishing along no less than 20 percent of the islands; exact
locations of such reserves have not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has met with strong opposition, most vehemently
from commercial harvesters, who last March staged a peaceful
protest at the Channel Islands National Park headquarters in
Ventura that drew 200 people. The vocal detractors claim the state
is already managing the islands' fisheries and further government
intervention would only harm the livelihoods of professional
fishermen who target sea urchin, sea cucumber, squid, lobster,
crab, shrimp and a variety of finned species.
</P>
<P>
   Recreationists have raised other queries:
</P>
<P>
   When statistics show that most catches of state fish are taken
by commercial harvesters, why should sportfishermen be included in
such a ban. How long would a ban last? Will financially strapped
policing agencies have enough funding and peoplepower to properly
enforce no-take zones?
</P>

HUSKIES HAVEN'T LIVED UP TO HEIGHTENED EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having played at Indiana and Duke and becoming an answer to the
question, ``Who is the only player to have appeared in two Final
Fours with two different teams?,'' Washington Coach Bob Bender is
familiar with the bull's-eye effect.
</P>
<P>
   That's when every game is huge _ for your opponent. It means
you're a marked team, and everyone's best shot awaits. It means
your program, like Indiana and Duke, has reached a certain level.
In the Pac-10, Arizona, UCLA and lately, Stanford, know what it's
like to be a circle on someone's calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Huskies know, too. With four starters back from the team
that almost beat Connecticut in the Sweet 16, Washington was a
darling of the preseason prediction crowd. The Huskies checked in
at No. 8 in the Sports Illustrated rankings and No. 14 in both the
Associated Press and ESPN/``USA Today polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was flattering, and I thought the kids handled it pretty
well,'' Bender said. ``But what we did not have experience in, and
what we learned the hard way, is that when these things happen to
you and you get notoriety, you become an awfully big game for
people, and you'd better prepare for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Huskies might have been overrated, they certainly
appeared to fit somewhere in the Top 25. But they haven't played
like it. Going into tonight's game against Arizona State at Wells
Fargo Arena, Washington is 7-4, 0-1 in the Pac-10. They were upset
at Washington State on Sunday on a shot in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the Big Island Invitational in Hawaii and starting
4-0, the Huskies lost to Connecticut, which was expected, and to
Boise State and Gonzaga, which was not. After a three-game winning
streak that included a victory over New Mexico in Seattle,
Washington lost to a Washington State team picked to finish near
the bottom of the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't come together like an experienced team should be
expected to,'' said Bender, who has produced improvement in the
Huskies' record in the past four seasons. ``At times we've played
very well. But we haven't played to our abilities on a consistent
basis, and that's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies were expected to ride the talents of All-Pac-10
center Todd MacCulloch and guards Deon Luton and Donald Watts, the
highest-scoring threesome in the league last season. But Watts
missed four games and part of another because of a sprained ankle
and still isn't 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And some have suggested the Huskies need a new travel agent.
After three games in Hawaii, they went to Chicago to face UConn in
the Great Eight, then played road games against Gonzaga and Boise
State before returning home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we'd put ourselves in a difficult position with the
travel,'' Bender said. ``But I thought we'd respond better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bender also is getting uncertain play from his young and
relatively inexperienced point guard combination of Senque Carey
and Dan Dickau. But ASU Coach Rob Evans, for one, knows the Huskies
remain dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more than dangerous,'' he said. ``Washington is still
one of the top 20 teams in the country. They're a very, very good
basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   But they haven't been all that good in the state of Arizona
lately. Since 1989, the Huskies are 2-19 against the Sun Devils and
Wildcats, who they play Saturday in Tucson. If history holds up,
Washington is looking at an 0-3 start in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a heightened sense of urgency,'' Bender said. ``No
question about it.'' &QL;

TEMPERS FLARE DAY AFTER TIE  
 ROENICK, TVERDOVSKY TRADE SOME PUNCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Jeremy Roenick coming back from a concussion, about the
last thing the Coyotes wanted to see Tuesday night was their star
center dropping the gloves and trying to duke it out with Florida's
Ed Jovanovski.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine then, the team's surprise Wednesday when Roenick not
once, but twice, and almost a third time, dropped the gloves with
teammate Oleg Tverdovsky and traded punches during a spirited
practice in Scottsdale a day after the Coyotes' disappointing 2-2
tie.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick, clearly upset with a couple of miscues from Tverdovsky
during some drills at the Cellular One Ice Den, barked loudly at
the fifth-year defenseman from across the ice. Tverdovsky shouted
back, and the two exchanged obscenities.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, Tverdovsky skated toward Roenick and the two
fought while teammates tried to separate them. A moment after that,
another fight erupted. Then, the two had more words before Coyotes
Coach Jim Schoenfeld finally skated over and intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Roenick, the Coyotes' leading scorer with 39 points, nor
Tverdovsky was injured. After the first scrap, captain Keith
Tkachuk, out for at least two more weeks with a fractured rib, left
the bench area shaking his head, feigning a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble in paradise? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes (21-8-5), still riding the best start in the 20-year
history of their franchise as they entertain the Edmonton Oilers
(15-18-4) tonight, simply were coming off a listless outing against
an average NHL club. What made it worse was that it came on the
heels of two impressive performances against the New York Rangers
and the Dallas Stars, when the team was playing short-handed
without its entire top forward line.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never like to see stuff like that happen,'' Roenick said
of his incident with Tverdovsky. ``That's not something that should
be involved in a team game. But unfortunately, it does happen and
sometimes, it needs to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a day where everybody knew it was going to be a
tough day. Shoney (Schoenfeld) said before practice, `If you screw
up, we're going to skate.' Everybody's got to realize we've got to
pay attention, we've got to be ready to go. Granted, nothing
against the people that were involved. It's just that everybody has
to be mentally sharp. Especially on a day like today. It was not a
good day to screw up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky didn't have a lot to say about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really want to talk about it,'' he said. ``It should
stay within the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky, though, said the entire team looked lethargic
against the Panthers and suggested now is not the time to start
pointing fingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like everybody had trouble, not just a few guys,''
he said. ``We just looked tired. It's not an excuse. We just came
out a little flat. I think maybe we gave a lot away in the Dallas
game and we just didn't get as ready as we did for that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Roenick, who tangled with Tverdovsky during training camp in a
brief scrap where both players traded punches, said he has no
animosity toward the 22-year-old Russian, who was an All-Star at
age 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Oleg is one of the most talented, hardest-working guys
in the league in my opinion,'' Roenick said. ``It has nothing to do
with how I feel about him, with my relationship with Oleg. I'm one
of Oleg's biggest supporters. I think he can be one of the best
defensemen in the league. But we have to listen more. We have to
pay attention to detail.''
</P>
<P>
   A bitter-looking Schoenfeld kept reporters from entering the
locker room immediately after practice. Within a matter of minutes,
however, he invited the media, which included writers from Sports
Illustrated and ESPN magazine, into his office for a ``fireside
chat.''
</P>
<P>
   He was surprisingly calm, despite venting his anger earlier and
making his players skate repeated wind sprints for every mistake
they made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a situation where we have an intense group of players
and one isn't paying attention,'' Schoenfeld said. ``It happens in
the game of hockey. When one player fouls up, the entire team
suffers and you have a player take exception to it. But I haven't
seen many good teams that don't have a few disruptions like that.
If you care, you're going to get upset sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, concerned about a team that, in his words, isn't
listening _ something that cost the Coyotes on Tuesday during the
game-tying goal by the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the only thing they were doing really that was
dangerous,'' Schoenfeld said. ``So to me, because of a lack of
listening skills, that cost us a point. But it's been happening . .
. and that's why we're trying to nip it in the bud. We don't want
to wait until we lose two in a row or three, or it extends to four
or five.'' &QL;

OWNERS TAKE BACK CONTROL FROM AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the end, the battle between the NBA's owners and players may
not have been so much about greed as it was control.
</P>
<P>
   It was less about money than it was about power.
</P>
<P>
   After all, when you're talking about dividing $2 billion, are
there really any losers?
</P>
<P>
   The seeds of this labor dispute were planted the last time the
owners and union negotiated a deal. Agent David Falk emerged in
that dispute as the leader of a so-called ``dissident'' faction of
players that attempted to decertify the union.
</P>
<P>
   That move failed, but after the last agreement was reached, the
union's leadership was changed _ replaced by several of Falk's
clients, who then hired Billy Hunter as the new executive director
of the Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't really a war between Commissioner David Stern and
Hunter. It was a battle between the owners and Falk for control of
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The owners outlasted the super agent, even if it might have cost
them the league's marquee player, Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan probably could benefit by playing a shortened season. He
might even be able to win another championship.
</P>
<P>
   The bet here is that he's going to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan probably wanted to retire all along. What could be better
than hitting the last shot of your career to win a championship?
</P>
<P>
   But he represented a powerful bargaining chip for the union. Now
that the bargaining is done, don't be surprised if Jordan steps
aside and attributes the decision at least partly to the outcome of
the labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome reached Wednesday was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The owners claimed to be losing money under the last deal and
opened their books to prove it. The players, at Falk's prodding,
suggested that the owners were not including the appreciation of
their businesses in the equation.
</P>
<P>
   The owners had behind them the power of a new television
contract, which they shrewdly negotiated with NBC and Turner Sports
to pay them even during a lockout. The owners had control of most
of the league's arenas, making threats of forming alternative
leagues ring hollow.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, the owners won the battle of public
opinion. Fans weren't in an uproar. It was worse than that. They
didn't care.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, it became apparent that Hunter's and Falk's
``negotiating committee'' had lost the support of the majority of
players.
</P>
<P>
   When Hunter called in the players to give the negotiating
committee a vote of confidence in New York, he quickly learned that
most of his constituents were not willing to voice that support.
</P>
<P>
   The players weren't ready to lose an entire season. The owners
were and set today as the deadline for canceling the season,
turning the dispute into a $2 billion game of chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter had to swerve.
</P>
<P>
   The owners managed to get an unprecedented concession _ a
maximum on how much any player can be paid during the life of the
agreement. They managed to restrict future movement of players.
They have taken away leverage from young players who were getting
huge contracts without accomplishing much in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The $126 million contract extension the Minnesota Timberwolves
gave to Kevin Garnett last season is no longer possible under the
new rules. Plus, rookies now are tied up by the team that drafts
them for five years instead of three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know all the details, but I don't think there's any
question the owners accomplished a great deal in the
negotiations,'' agent Lon Babby said. ``They were largely the
aggressors. They reopened the agreement. They locked out the
players. And they reaped the benefits of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a winner and a loser. I think the
changes will help the owners more than the players, but I think we
all expected that going into this.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners also got concessions on ``character issues'' such as
adding marijuana to the league's list of banned drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-paid players, and those who were about to join them,
gave up the most. The league's so-called ``middle class'' _ the
journeymen _ are better off under the new deal. But the owners came
away with the most.
</P>
<P>
   They have nearly achieved the cost certainty they sought. More
important from their perspective, they have retaken control from
the agents.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured, the leadership in the NFL, NHL and Major League
Baseball, and their unions, were watching this very closely. NHL
Commissioner Gary Bettman, a former Stern lieutenant, already is
amassing a $300 million labor dispute fund, and his league's
contract isn't up until 2004. Baseball's next negotiation is a
couple years away.
</P>
<P>
   Stern and his owners have set a new standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds to me as if the owners got a lot,'' said Don Johnsen
, a labor relations attorney at the Phoenix law firm of Gallagher
and Kennedy. ``Obviously, I don't have knowledge of the
discussions, but in a situation where one party has imposed a
deadline, and the case is resolved right before that party's
deadline, you can usually glean that the other party came to them
and said, `Well, we'll take it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say it looks like a victory for the owners.
There's an old saying in this: Anytime both sides walk away mad,
you've got a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the feeling the owners are probably walking away a
little less mad than the players.'' &QL;

NBA QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Is there any chance Wednesday's agreement will be turned down?
</P>
<P>
   Not likely. The two sides have agreed in principle to the deal.
NBA Commissioner David Stern went into his late-night meeting with
the union's Billy Hunter knowing how far he could go. It's just a
matter of dotting i's and crossing t's.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; What will teams do now?
</P>
<P>
   They'll be trying to sift through the details to determine how
the particulars will affect them. General managers will attempt to
determine salary cap positions based on the new rules, then
determine which free agents they can afford to go after. About 200
free agents are available. Coaches will be planning for training
camps, which will be abbreviated.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Why did it take so long?
</P>
<P>
   There was much more at stake than money. This also was about
control. The owners wanted to regain some control over escalating
costs, and they faced a union leadership that was being influenced
by agents for the league's highest-paid players. Understandably,
the players didn't want to give back anything they had gained in
the past. Ultimately, they had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Would they have been better off canceling the season and
starting over
 &UR; again next fall?
</P>
<P>
   No. Even with an asterisk, something of a season is better than
nothing. Ironically, players such as Houston's Charles Barkley have
been complaining for years that the season should be shortened.
Barkley will have to change his ``the season isn't a sprint, it's a
marathon'' story.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Will Michael Jordan be back?
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it. It's likely he put off the decision to give his
union leverage. But he can't possibly write a better script than
hitting the final shot of his career to win a championship . . .
can he?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Will Kevin Johnson be back?
</P>
<P>
   He'll be playing, possibly in Sacramento, Golden State or _ in
the Suns' worst nightmare _ for the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Will the players be in shape?
</P>
<P>
   Some will, some won't. A benefit for the Suns is that Danny
Manning has had time to recuperate from knee surgery. He'll be in
great shape.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Will the quality of play suffer?
</P>
<P>
   We're betting it will early, without much of a training camp and
no preseason. But ultimately you're likely to get a better value
from that ticket to a midweek game against a lower-rung team. Every
game will mean more in a shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Which teams are in the best shape to go into the season?
</P>
<P>
   Veteran-laden teams with a lot of players under contract. Watch
for the Indiana Pacers, who fit that description and who have been
working out as a team throughout the lockout. In the Western
Conference, Utah might be in the best position.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Will the new agreement help or hurt the Suns?
</P>
<P>
   Depends. It will help their effort to keep Antonio McDyess. It
will significantly damage their hopes of signing a big-time free
agent, such as Scottie Pippen or Tom Gugliotta.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How does the deal help the league's weaker teams?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; It controls their costs, it enables them to lock up their
younger players for more seasons and should limit movement of free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How do all those unsigned players find a home in so short a
period of time?
</P>
<P>
   They won't. There will be a lot of take-it-or-leave-it offers.
Agents may actually earn their percentages.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Will they be more likely to re-sign with their teams of last
year?
</P>
<P>
   Not really. With almost 200 free agents, many players will just
want to come out of this with jobs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Does the new agreement do anything to help the league's
``middle-class''
 &UR; players, such as Rex Chapman, or does it protect the marquee
players?
</P>
<P>
   It will help the journeymen, the middle class and the longtime
veterans. The marquee players will still make a pretty good buck,
but now there's a limit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Will the agreement encourage or discourage young players from
leaving
 &UR; college early or going to the pros from high school?
</P>
<P>
   It might discourage them because they could be tied to a team
for five years _ a three-year scale, a team option for the fourth
and a right of first refusal for the team in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Will season ticket holders have the option of getting a refund
for the
 &UR; balance of the season?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; No word yet, but unlikely. Season ticket holders have received
refund checks, at 6 percent interest, for games missed in November
and December.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Will prices be discounted?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sounds like a capital idea. Before the lockout, the Suns locked
into a price increase that averaged 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Will the fans return?
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, very slowly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Will the altered NBA season impact WNBA scheduling?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Probably not, especially if the regular season ends only two
weeks later than usual. The NBA Finals and WNBA regular season
slightly overlapped in 1998. A draft WNBA schedule has not been
given to teams, but play is expected to begin around June 10 and
conclude close to Labor Day. Expect to see the Mercury schedule by
the end of January.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Will this year's statistics be marked with an asterisk?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hey, just be glad there is a season. Save the asterisks for
baseball.

YAWNS, SHRUGS AND RESENTFUL FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happened about 6 a.m. Eastern Conference time.
</P>
<P>
   Low on coffee and out of insults, and the shot clock ticking
down, Commissioner David Stern and union head Billy Hunter shook
hands across a table and SAVED the NBA season!
</P>
<P>
   The lockout is over!
</P>
<P>
   God Bless America.
</P>
<P>
   NBA players will go back to work after accepting a six-year deal
that will pay them 52 percent of the gross national product
``divided'' by Oliver Miller's current weight.
</P>
<P>
   The league compromised, too.
</P>
<P>
   Stern agreed to shave.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kidd and his teammates will begin play next month as if
nothing has happened. Of course, much has happened and changed as a
result of the bitter labor dispute. For this abbreviated,
irrelevant season, our team's name will be slightly different.
</P>
<P>
   During the lockout we lost 30 games.
</P>
<P>
   And, sadly, four letters.
</P>
<P>
   Meet your Enix Uns.
</P>
<P>
   The public had three reactions to Wednesday's big news. Some
yawned and shrugged. Some shrugged and yawned.
</P>
<P>
   Others got mad all over again.
</P>
<P>
   When you heard the two sides had settled only hours before the
so-called ``drop-dead'' date to cancel the season, did you mutter,
``I wish they would'' drop dead? Figuratively, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Resentment is in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Many people resent the players for their wealth. NBA athletes
have the highest average salary ($2.6 million) in professional
sports.
</P>
<P>
   They resent pro athletes who remind us they are entertainers,
like singers and movie stars. Actors make millions for one movie.
True, but a ticket to the matinee doesn't cost $75.
</P>
<P>
   Working stiffs resent that most of them can't afford to attend
an NBA game.
</P>
<P>
   They resent being told, ``You don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   They resent fat cat owners who keep raising ticket prices so
they can pay Kevin Garnett $126 million.
</P>
<P>
   They resent Patrick Ewing, who said that with a hard salary cap,
``We as players can't survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing makes $18 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   They resent David Robinson, who compared NBA players to civil
rights heroes fighting for their rights.
</P>
<P>
   They resent the fact that in October, when an arbitrator ruled
that owners did not have to pay up to $800 million for guaranteed
contracts during the lockout, the players (who lost much of their
leverage) regrouped to plot their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   They resent that it took six months for the sides to agree upon
how to split $2 ``billion'' in annual revenue. If the ``drop-dead''
date had been Nov. 1, this would have been settled Nov. 1. Too much
money to throw away.
</P>
<P>
   They resent the violent and lawless behavior of a few players
who have tainted the league. Right or wrong, like it or not, pro
athletes are role models. Kids look up to them. What does that say
about our society?
</P>
<P>
   Did you shrug first, or yawn? Or maybe you're truly excited
about the NBA's return.
</P>
<P>
   In major markets, fans will flock back to NBA arenas once the
games begin. Danny Ainge's team will play to big crowds at home.
Most of the tickets are sold. The club will offer about 1,200
tickets for sale each game.
</P>
<P>
   Did you miss not having the NBA? A wire service story quoted a
Jazz fan in Salt Lake City as saying of the news, ``I'm so happy. I
almost cried.''
</P>
<P>
   I found the soft drink commercials spoofing out-of-work NBA
players more entertaining than most games.
</P>
<P>
   In one, Grant Hill is trying to make ends meet working as a
handyman. Dressed in his Pistons uniform, he changes a light bulb
in a chandelier that is out of reach of most humans. He rescues a
cat perched on a roof. For jobs, call 1-800-TALL-GUYS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows,'' Hill says, ``when the season is going to start?''
</P>
<P>
   February, they say now.
</P>
<P>
   The season is SAVED!
</P>
<P>
   Are they going to play doubleheaders?
</P>
<P>
   Too late for most of us.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing the union leaders saved was face. &QL;

PLAYERS PREPARED TO SEE RESENTMENT FROM FANS  
 ROOKIES RELIEVED CAREERS FINALLY WILL GET STARTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were regrets, relief, some doubt, an apology and at least
one loud cheer from players and agents who will be back on the job
not long after the owners' expected approval today of an agreement
that will officially end the NBA lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``An apology is in order,'' Suns guard Jason Kidd said from New
York on Wednesday after the Players Association ratified a deal
struck by NBA Commissioner David Stern and union chief Billy
Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd wanted to say sorry to the fans who had to endure the
spectacle of millionaire players and billionaire owners haggling
over $2 billion during a two-month stretch without a single slam
dunk or choked coach.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd also asked for some understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our job, and there's a lot of work stoppages in
business,'' he said. ``This was our turn.''
</P>
<P>
   It's anybody's guess as to whether fans are in a forgiving mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans, some of them will have a bad attitude, and some of
them will come,'' former Suns forward Charles Barkley, a Houston
free agent, told ESPN.com during an interactive computer session
with fans. ``But we can't worry about that. We just have to go and
do our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why any fan would spend $50 for a seat after the
contentious negotiations, Barkley said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do my job. I don't care if anyone is at the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley applauded the deal but conceded the league was hurt in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, a lot of damage has been done,'' he said.
``Everyone is talking about the fans. We didn't have to sign a bad
deal just for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   While the deal appears sealed, Suns management is still in a
lockout frame of mind. Team officials said they were ordered not to
comment, and Coach Danny Ainge was meeting with his staff all day.
</P>
<P>
   A deal _ any kind of deal _ represented relief, if not a
spontaneous celebration, for two 1998 draft picks, Mike Bibby and
Pat Garrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I cheered,'' said Bibby, a 6-foot-2 guard who was
working out with Garrity at an L.A. Fitness Club in the Valley when
he heard the news. ``I smiled. I was happy. I was really
relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby, picked No. 2 by Vancouver after two years at the
University of Arizona and prep stardom at Shadow Mountain High, was
plagued by the uncertainty of when, or even if, his rookie season
would begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating,'' Bibby said. ``But I figured the longer
it took, the more I'd be ready. I looked at it as a way that could
benefit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby said he never considered playing in Europe, unlike
Garrity, whose rights were acquired by the Suns in a three-way,
draft-day deal after he was picked No. 19 by Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Garrity thought about following Michael Olowokandi, the No. 1
pick whose rookie year with the Los Angeles Clippers was delayed
when he signed with an Italian League team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty hard,'' said Garrity, a 6-9 forward from
Notre Dame. ``When the Europe thing came up, I had to think hard
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   For Garrity, the issue has not been money. He said he was only
eager to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really worried about the money because I knew if the
players gave up anything, the rookies would be first,'' he said.
``There was no way it was going to be the old way. That was a fact
of life, so being a young guy, I was really worried more about
playing. I didn't buy anything, so I didn't have to worry about
paying the bills.''
</P>
<P>
   A rookie on the eve of his first season is always filled with
some anxiety. But this rookie season doesn't figure to be typical.
Garrity is not sure what to expect. Some of the veterans could be
unhappy with the money they're getting under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I've heard from people, they're going to have a hard
time having the same love for the players and their teams,''
Garrity said. ``You used to hear about what guys make, but now it's
really going to be on people's minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first week, it's going to be sloppy and people are going
to say: `These guys were arguing for how many million?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some agents are skeptical about some of the reported
elements of the deal, including a five-year rookie salary scale
that gives teams an option for the player's fourth season and the
right of first refusal for his fifth. First-round draft picks would
be split into categories based on where they were picked: first 10,
second 10 and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like you don't want to be drafted,'' Keith Glass,
agent for Suns assistant coach Scott Skiles, told the Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the long-term impact, the deal could precipitate some

   ``Obviously, it will be very busy,'' said Mark Bartelstein,
agent for veteran Suns forward Danny Manning. ``We've got a lot of
free agents. We've got to find them homes and teams. Get other guys
into camps. Get up and rolling. I'm sure I'll probably talk to a
lot of teams.'' &QL;

COUNT ON TIGER TO SHOW FOR OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will he or won't he? Only Tiger Woods' barber knows for sure.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as Greg Norman and Fred Couples are concerned, don't
expect them to be in the lineup when the Phoenix Open tees off Jan.
28-31.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I think Woods will show up at the TPC of Scottsdale.
In fact, Tiger's mind was made up to play here long before he
announced that he will do a special kids clinic Jan. 23-24 at Glen
Lakes Golf Club in Glendale. The decision to withhold his
commitment until the last minute, well, that's just Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   According to his agent, Mark Steinberg of IMG, Woods' appearance
at the clinic ``certainly can't hurt Tiger's chances'' of playing
in the Phoenix Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has had some good experiences, some good vibes, at Phoenix
in the past, and I think that bodes well,'' Steinberg said,
referring to the well-documented hole in one that Woods made at the
16th hole in the 1997 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he does not confirm (his entry) until about a week before
most tournaments for obvious reasons _ mainly because it does a lot
of damage when he confirms and then has to pull out for unexpected
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg added that ``several of the tour's top players confirm
their appearances that way.''
</P>
<P>
   But Norman and Couples _ arguably the PGA Tour's other two major
superstars _ have indicated that they don't plan to play in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg is not going to be playing golf for the month of January
under doctor's orders,'' Bart Collins of Great White Shark Inc.
said, noting that Norman's surgically repaired shoulder still is in
a state of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a miracle, Couples also appears to be history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fred has released a tentative schedule for this year, and he's
off that week,'' said Lynn Roach of Players Group Inc. of Reston,
Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has committed to the first three tournaments (of the
season), and he rarely plays four in a row. Of course, that always
is subject to change.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality is Couples usually skips Phoenix, a tournament he
last showed up for in 1990. He often cites the party-hearty
atmosphere here for why he doesn't enter. But the lingering effects
of a playoff loss to Sandy Lyle in 1988, when Couples hit
back-to-back tee shots into the water at the 18th, probably have
something to do with it, too.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a few other ``name players'' missing, most notably
Mark O'Meara, Davis Love III and Ernie Els. But that trio really
doesn't fit into the same category as Woods, Norman and Couples.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: If Woods does join guys such as David Duval,
Phil Mickelson, Justin Leonard, Steve Jones, Nick Price, Mark
Calcavecchia, Payne Stewart, Tom Watson, Lee Janzen, Vijay Singh,
John Daly and Tom Lehman (his surgically repaired shoulder
permitting), this will be one of the better Phoenix Opens of recent
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we won't have Nicklaus or Palmer either,'' tournament
Chairman Ray Artigue said. ``But it's still going to be a damn good
tournament.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
New courses &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Arizona golf rush, which includes as many as 25 courses
either breaking ground or opening up this year, officially gets
under way with the debuts of Augusta Ranch Golf Club in Mesa and a
second course at Tonto Verde in Rio Verde.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta Ranch, located at Baseline and Ellsworth Roads, is an
executive layout by Bill Phillips that will cost $25 to $32 to
play. It is set to open Jan. 16, and tee times can be made by
calling 354-1234.
</P>
<P>
   The second course at Tonto Verde, which opens Feb. 1, was done
by Gary Panks, half of the team (minus David Graham) that did the
first course. Both tracts are semiprivate and will be open to the
public on a rotating basis for a $95 green fee. Call 471-2710. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tap-ins &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turquoise Valley Golf Course in Naco (on the Mexican border,
south of Bisbee) has just completed a nine-hole addition and will
re-open Jan. 15. Turquoise Valley, which opened its first nine
holes way back in 1908, costs $14. Call (520) 432-3025.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, the Arizona Golf Association's season is
already upon us. The AGA will host its Short Course Championship
Jan. 9-10 at Ahwatukee Lakes. Sign-ups for openings in the regular
and senior divisions can be made by calling 944-3035.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of 650 golfers by the National Golf Foundation
turned up a ``What? Me Worry?'' attitude toward wearing sunscreen
while playing the game. Only 19 percent said they ``always'' use
sunscreen, while 36.9 percent said they ``occasionally'' use it.
Given the dangers of the harmful ultraviolet rays and resulting
skin cancer, it seems amazing (stupid?) that 27.2 percent say they
rarely apply sunscreen while 16.2 percent ``never'' use it. &QL;

ANOTHER CARD COLLECTS WEEKLY AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals cornerback Aeneas Williams has been named NFL
Defensive Player of the Week after intercepting two passes and
limiting Michael Irvin to four catches for 32 yards in Arizona's
20-7 wild-card playoff win over Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the fifth time this season, and second week in a row,
that a Cardinals player has earned the honor.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Simeon Rice, safety Tommy Bennett and Kwamie
Lassiter (last week) have earned the honor, and quarterback Jake
Plummer was named offensive Player of the Week after the New
Orleans game. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tough room &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals locker room was a tough place Wednesday for
Florida State alums Andre Wadsworth, Scott Player and Carl Simpson
with Tennessee alum J.J. McCleskey around.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was the flag McCleskey hung denoting the Volunteers
as No. 1 after Monday's 23-16 win over Florida State in the
Tostitos Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   If by chance the Seminoles trio happened to miss that, McCleskey
put signs in each of their lockers saying: ``I was there. Tennessee
23. Florida State 16. Tostitos Fiesta Bowl National Championship
Game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have to do much talking,'' McCleskey said. ``The
scoreboard did it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Cardinals came off the practice field Wednesday,
McCleskey told Wadsworth that, ``Everybody is waiting for you to
sing Rocky Top.'' He then began teaching him the words.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth wasn't surprised by the actions of McCleskey, who had
promised before the game that he would downplay a Volunteers
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's J.J.'s style,'' Wadsworth said. ``What else do you
expect from him?'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tough assignment &QL; 
 &QL; 
At 6-foot-1, 338 pounds, Jerry Ball is just that: a human wrecking
ball. No one knows it better than Cardinals center Aaron Graham,
who will be head-up on Ball, the nose guard who defined the
position in the NFL and is tied for the Vikings' team lead in
tackles for losses with 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been in the league for 12 years, and you have to do a lot
of things right to be around that long,'' Graham said. ``He's going
to be a load, but we've got a game plan to help me out and to help
the other guys with John Randle.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham played behind starter Mike Devlin last year when the
Cardinals lost, 20-19, to the Vikings at home, so now Devlin is
instructing Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's short, so it's hard to get leverage on him,'' Devlin
said. ``He's also very athletic _ he could dunk a basketball at 350
pounds. He crowds the ball, and you can't let it be a factor and
use it to your advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is going to make some plays, but with things like our
no-huddle offense and faster tempo we might tire him out. Aaron
needs to get his hands on him and get leverage. What makes he so
good is the personnel around him. You have to double John Randle
and do other things, which puts him one-on-one. He has been around
long enough to know he can beat a lot of guys one-on-one.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Extra points &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin wasn't pleased with Wednesday's practice,
calling it average.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a couple days off and weren't as sharp as I hoped.
But we got two more days to get everything honed up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have extended Fan Appreciation Day, originally
scheduled from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Friday at Warner/Hardy Park north
of the training facility, by one hour to end at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The team also has arranged another charter package for fans to
attend Sunday's game in Minnesota. The cost is $859. Call
998-8922. &QL;

SAFETY CATCHES ON  
 CARDINALS' BENNETT DOES JOB IN SECONDARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ringing has long since dissipated, giving way to a burning
inside Tommy Bennett, who hopes not only to improve the Cardinals'
recent history against Minnesota but also his own.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Bennett was flattened on blindside blocks by
Vikings receiver Chris Walsh. Twice. Pancaked. Knocked cold.
</P>
<P>
   That's embarrassing to any defensive player, but to have it
happen twice in the same game from the same player defies the
senses of a competitor like Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I don't want to forget it,'' said Bennett, who is in
his first full season as starting strong safety. ``It's something
I'm going to have in the back of my mind. That's added incentive
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and the others in the secondary should need little added
incentive when facing the Vikings' record-setting offense in the
second round of the NFL playoffs on Sunday at the Metrodome.
Minnesota, with veteran quarterback Randall Cunningham playing much
younger than his 35 years, accounted for a record 556 points, most
of them by receivers Cris Carter, Randy Moss and Jake Reed.
</P>
<P>
   But if Bennett needed any further firing up, he could look not
only to the bell-ringing administered to him in a 20-19 loss to the
Vikings at Sun Devil Stadium but also to the Cardinals' last visit
to Minnesota, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   They had battled to get to 6-6 after an 0-3 start. It was
Bennett's first start, replacing injured Matt Darby. The Cardinals
had won three straight. Another would establish them as a playoff
contender in Coach Vince Tobin's first season.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings quickly found Bennett, an undrafted rookie, and went
to work on him. He didn't handle it well. The result was a 41-17
blowout loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd worked so hard to get back to .500 and had a chance to
cross that bridge,'' Bennett said. ``They just blew us out. It was
a bad day on both sides of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a new situation for me that afternoon. It wasn't easy.
If we could go back and come out with a victory this time, it would
be really special to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Marmie, defensive backs coach, accepts part of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went up there a couple of years ago and probably had Tommy
in a bad situation a couple of times in man coverage and some
things that really he hadn't had much work on,'' Marmie said. ``Of
course last year I think everybody remembers the blocks. I know
Tommy is looking forward to playing against them this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett missed two weeks because of a multitude of injuries
after the hits by Walsh. Both came on third and long. Bennett had
moved up to play linebacker, assigned to cover the back. Carter
came across the formation and caught a short pass. Bennett was
chasing him when Walsh, who had run a curl pattern behind Bennett,
blindsided him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see him behind me,'' Bennett said. ``I was in a tough
spot. I don't have any lingering effects. It's just part of the
game. I've gotten conked like that before, it's just that it
happened twice in same game. That's what made it stand out so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they look for me again. I want them to keep an eye on
me because I'll be out there making plays.''
</P>
<P>
   It's because Brent Alexander and Darby didn't make enough of
them that they're gone, and Bennett and Kwamie Lassiter are
first-year starting safeties. In the Minnesota game last year, the
Cardinals were in position to win when there was no safety help
from Alexander on a third-and-long pass. Andrew Glover caught the
ball over the middle and ran 43 yards to keep the drive alive. With
10 seconds left, Eddie Murray kicked a field goal for a 20-19 win.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Lassiter has eight interceptions, four knockdowns
and two forced fumbles. Bennett is third on the team with 125
tackles, has two interceptions, four knockdowns, and three tackles
for lost yardage. Bennett intercepted Troy Aikman in the final
seconds Saturday to slam the door on the Cowboys in the Cardinals
first playoff win since 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and Lassiter each has been named NFC Defensive Player of
the Week for making the kinds of plays the Cardinals are not
accustomed to receiving from their safeties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done some things that we didn't do in the past that
hurt us,'' Marmie said. ``That's been the thing that we've talked
about all year, so hopefully we have gotten better. We have made
some plays back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Bennett says he is highly motivated to make a few against
the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying we're satisfied, but I think the coaches are
lot more pleased,'' Bennett said.  &QL;

DEVILS DEFEAT RANGERS, 5-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of these nights, one of these years, the Rangers
will beat the Devils in a regular-season game. Twice on Wednesday
night they scored power-play goals to take early leads on their New
Jersey rivals at Madison Square Garden. With the Devils missing two
regular players and the Rangers in good health, it seemed as if it
might be the night for New York, which was on a three-game winning
streak, to change the course of recent history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had played the night before, and the Rangers had the
night off. Wouldn't that give the Rangers a slight edge?
</P>
<P>
   But the Devils, once again, showed why they are leading the
Eastern Conference and the Rangers are scrapping for a playoff
berth. The visitors got two goals by Randy McKay and they got
better goaltending from Martin Brodeur than the Rangers got from
Mike Richter.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case in recent seasons, the Devils are bigger,
tougher, stronger and younger than the Rangers, and they have more
depth. They just wore New York down, and the 5-2 victory gave the
Devils four victories in four games against the Rangers this
season, and a 9-0-4 record in their meetings since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers last beat New Jersey in the second round of the
playoffs in 1997. ``We're getting a little closer,'' said Rangers
Coach John Muckler. ``Brodeur was the better goalkeeper tonight. We
didn't grab the brass ring.''
</P>
<P>
   By losing, the Rangers again fell below the .500 mark. They play
the Capitals in Washington on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristic of this season's Rangers, they didn't quit. John
MacLean, the former Devil, had a goal and several good chances,
including a breakaway, during a five-shot effort. Wayne Gretzky
fired wide on a third-period breakaway against Brodeur, and buzzed
around the goalie's cage on a subsequent power play with several
fine passes. Muckler said those breakaways were pivotal, and
Gretzky agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had him beat,'' Gretzky said, ``and I hit him in
the shoulder a little bit. We did some good things. We didn't do
enough to overcome the cloud they have over us.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur said Gretzky's shot might have hit his elbow, and that
MacLean's shot went wide after hitting the goalie's glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rangers are a team we get up for,'' Brodeur said. ``The
difference now is that we put the puck in the net a lot more
often.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes after Gretzky's breakaway, New Jersey's Patrik
Elias put the contest out of reach by scoring on a rebound at 15
minutes 59 seconds of the third period to make the score 5-2. The
other New Jersey goals were scored by Brendan Morrison and Jay
Pandolfo.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Harvey scored the first Ranger goal but took a
body-checking beating from several Devils, particularly defenseman
Scott Stevens. Devils Coach Robbie Ftorek said Stevens was
``working like a mad dog.''
</P>
<P>
   MacLean's goal put New York up by 2-1 at 19:57 of the first
period, but Pandolfo and McKay scored on second-period shots that
Richter might have stopped on other nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have both back,'' Richter said. ``That was the
difference in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He was replaced by Dan Cloutier after McKay's first goal. McKay
got his second at 18:31 by knocking a rebound past Cloutier after
Brian Rolston's shot hit the post. McKay has three goals in two
nights after returning from a 17-day absence that included an elbow
infection and the flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely didn't expect to come back with this much
success,'' McKay said.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik, who assisted on McKay's first goal, said: ``If you
outplay a team physically, then you win. Especially against a
division rival. And we did it tonight. We outplayed them
physically.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils did it without Dave Andreychuk, their veteran left
wing, who broke a bone in his right ankle on Tuesday during a 3-3
tie with San Jose. The team said he would be re-evaluated today and
he is expected to miss several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils also were without Bob Carpenter, their checking
center, who has not played since the previous meeting between the
teams, a 6-3 Devils victory at the Meadowlands on Dec. 16.
Carpenter injured the big toe on his left foot when hit by a
Gretzky shot. Called up from Albany for the Devils was John Madden,
a center.

LOCKOUT SPARED NBA FANS EARLY-SEASON BOREDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For a split second, this column was going to be a
hand-wringing diatribe about the utter foolishness of the NBA's
last six miserable months.
</P>
<P>
   Why bother? What's done is done.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, with a glut of tasty NFL and college hoops games _ we
consider the penalty-riddled Fiesta Bowl a non-factor in viable,
alternative sporting fare _ no one missed the 400-some NBA games
that did not get played in 1998-99, except maybe Spike Lee and Dyan
Cannon.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping, eating, cleaning the house, walking the dog, writing
letters, reading books, searching the internet for hot new stocks
... you name it, it was a wonderful alternative to the usual round
of early-season NBA games.
</P>
<P>
   What did we miss? Clippers at Nuggets? Grizzlies at Kings? The
defense rests.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for another split second, this column was going to laud
NBA commissioner David Stern for one of the most impressive rounds
of hardball labor negotiating this side of U.S. Steel or General
Motors.
</P>
<P>
   All apologies to union chief negotiator Billy Hunter and David
Falk mouthpiece Patrick Ewing, but the commissioner had the clout.
</P>
<P>
   Stern also had the deadlines, the control and the gall to rouse
a rebellious spirit from within the union's rank and file, getting
guys like Jeff Hornacek and Avery Johnson to question the authority
and the sanity of the union's bargaining committee, who waited too
long to start to deal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his doomsday proclamation Monday that the season would
be canceled Thursday if the players did not agree to the league's
proposal, Stern obviously was not willing to throw the NBA's future
into utter chaos.
</P>
<P>
   But it sure went to the wire, which is the whole stinking point
of hardball negotiating, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Since last July's start of the lockout, the union's
Falk-controlled negotiating unit failed to understand that Stern
was not whistling Dixie when he demanded serious compromise to
achieve ``cost containment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cost containment'' is a euphemism. What Stern really wanted
was a collective bargaining agreement that would shackle the NBA's
spend-crazed owners.
</P>
<P>
   And he got it, for now, until the loopholes of this new six-year
deal are exploited by cunning, rich owners who will find ways to
skirt the salary cap and the free-agent rules, just as they have
done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, there's a deal both sides say they can live
with _ as if living with any percentage of $2 billion is a tough
pill to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   And for now, let's go ahead and admit one ugly but basic truth
about the end of this lockout: We're happy.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, happy.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's done, who cares anymore about what happened during
July, August, September and October, when it didn't matter one
ounce that the players were locked out anyway.
</P>
<P>
   And as of now, who cares what happened in November and December,
either. Here in Seattle, we would have witnessed the great Chicago
Bulls come to KeyArena for a meaningless Nov. 25 game and look so
shoddy, so rag-tag, everyone would have been predicting Michael
Jordan would never win his seventh NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Hah! What happens in November and December has little bearing on
what happens in June, when Sir Air and the quality of the game tend
to soar.
</P>
<P>
   But now that a deal has been accepted, and now that a 50-plus
game season has been promised, I just want to know:
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Are the Sonics going hard after Jayson Williams or
Scottie Pippen or what, since more than half the league's players
are free agents?
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Is Jordan really going to retire?
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Can Shawn Kemp shed the tire he's suddenly wearing
around his midsection?
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Will the Suns get Scottie or Antonio McDyess, or does
Randy Johnson suit up?
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Will the Rockets sign McDyess or Damon Stoudamire, and
will Charles Barkley make good on his tease to go the Knicks?
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) What will George Karl create in Milwaukee, where the
Bucks will be running so much during the accelerated training camp
Glenn Robinson will wish he played for Pat Riley?
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) How will the Two Jerrys sell the Bulls to Chicago if
Batman and Robin and Dennis Rodman are retired, relocated or
playing cards in Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the next month should be wild. What kind of feverish
deals will go down now across America _ a crazy land where owners
and players of a fabulously wealthy pro league can lock heads and
stall like Ken Starr and Bill Clinton one day, then show up on the
steps of Madison Square Garden the next day, bearing a joint
proclamation of: ``I Love This Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Stern knew his timetable. The players could feel it,
too. Up until Feb. 1, missing games did not matter. But once the
Super Bowl is done and TV screens hunger for sports entertainment
programming, it's time to play.
</P>
<P>
   For fools like me, it will be hard to resist, ignore or protest
this baloney but interesting NBA season-to-be. Detlef and Hawk and
Vin and The Glove will be fun to watch, after the rust comes off.
</P>
<P>
   Apathy toward the NBA was fun while it lasted. But listen and
you can hear the basketballs starting to bounce. Against our better
judgment, it sounds pretty good.

SONICS EAGER TO COURT NETS FREE AGENT WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seattle SuperSonics president Wally Walker was
sitting in an airplane while the NBA got up off the mat and
salvaged its season here early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Walker doesn't figure to be a sideline figure when Round Two
comes up. There promises to be a frenzy as teams hurry to make
trades and sign roughly 200 free agents when an abbreviated
training camp starts around Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
   According to team sources, the Sonics' sights are clearly set on
New Jersey Nets mad rebounder Jayson Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics will apparently make a hard push for Williams'
services when the free-agent period begins in about 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' agent, Sal DiFazio, said Wednesday his client
considers Seattle a viable option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect the Sonics will be one of the players who will
get in touch with us over the next 24 to 48 hours,'' DiFazio said.
``I expect there will be a flurry of activity. The Sonics are
certainly a team we would have an interest in but we'll wait to see
what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonic teammates Gary Payton and forward Vin Baker have courted
Williams throughout the offseason. Payton is pressing management to
pick up a bona fide rebounder, and Williams more than fits the
bill. He averaged 13.6 rebounds and 12.9 points last season, and
led the Nets with 39 double-doubles. Williams averaged 13.5 boards
in 1996-97 and 10 rebounds in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
   The only snag will be Williams' heart. As a New York native,
Williams has often expressed the desire to remain in New Jersey. He
reiterated Wednesday that the Nets will have the first opportunity
to sign him.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you not like the chance to play with Gary and Vin? But
I'm going to give New Jersey the first pop,'' Williams said.
``Hopefully, we don't have to give them too long because I want to
get into camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Signing Williams might be considered a longshot for the Sonics,
but it is possible after Wednesday's labor agreement. Under the old
system, Williams _ a seven-year veteran _ could have signed with
New Jersey for any amount. The current deal limits players with
seven years of experience to $11 million _ an amount the Sonics
could pay if the salary cap reaches $30-$32 million as expected,
and a minor trade is made.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see a frenzy,'' said Eric Goodwin, Payton's agent.
``Whenever there's a cap, there's always a way around it. But you
don't know the way around it until you see the final agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics have six players under contract: Payton, Baker,
Detlef Schrempf, Jim McIlvaine, Hersey Hawkins and Aaron Williams.
The team's three draft picks _ Vladimir Stepania, Rashard Lewis and
Jelani McCoy _ could join the team as soon as training camp opens.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff has compiled a list of 15 free agents at each
position, and ranked them. If one player is not available, the
Sonics will quickly go after the next guy on their list.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sonics can't pry away Williams, who is beloved for his
comedic personality as much as his skill, here are other scenarios:
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Houston free agent forward Charles Barkley left the
door open for signing a one-year deal with the Sonics, saying:
``Anything is possible at this point.'' Barkley maintained a good
relationship with new Sonic coach Paul Westphal during their days
with the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Golden State free agent Jason Caffey is a middle-income
player that the Sonics believe can produce solid minutes off the
bench with his muscle and rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) If Scottie Pippen does not return to the Chicago Bulls,
the Sonics are expected to show interest.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) Although Sam Perkins is not under consideration,
sources said the team would be happy to re-sign scrappy forward
Jerome Kersey.
</P>
<P>
   (bullet) The Sonics will look to retain several of their own
free agents. They want to re-sign small forward Dale Ellis,
although San Antonio will be bidding for him. Last year's backup
point guard, Greg Anthony, is a priority as well as swingman James
Cotton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard from them since before the lockout,'' said
Cotton, who attended the union's meeting Wednesday. ``I talked to
coach (Paul) Westphal before the lockout, and I got a pretty good
feeling that they liked me. I just want to play a little more than
I did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal is clearly interested in a young small forward who can
handle the ball and play shooting guard behind Hersey Hawkins. The
team clearly needs to get younger, stronger, more versatile and
more athletic after being manhandled by the Los Angeles Lakers in
the Western Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The team's first transaction could involve Stepania. The
coaching staff is extremely impressed by Stepania's versatile
scoring ability, ballhandling and rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Dutt, an agent for Shawn Kemp and Antonio McDyess who says
he represents Stepania, said he is already working on Stepania's
release from his European contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do everything we can to get him over here as
soon as possible,'' Dutt said Wedesday. ``He wants to be here. The
leverage they have isn't that strong.''

BRISK CONSTRUCTION PACE FORECAST THROUGH 2000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Construction activity across California, already
robust, should make sizeable gains through 2000 with a big chunk of
it in Southern California, according to a report released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   All types of construction -- residential, commercial and
industrial -- are expected to increase by a combined 13 percent
this year and 8 percent in 2000, concludes the Burbank-based
Construction Industry Research Board.
</P>
<P>
   The board predicts that permits will be issued this year for
construction valued at $49.6 billion and next year, for $53.5
billion worth of building activity.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Bartolotto, the board's director, said construction is being
driven by job growth across the state, which is outpacing the
national rate.
</P>
<P>
   Contracting activity will be robust over the next two years in
home-building, heavy construction and highway projects, the board
expects, while commercial and industrial building activity will
grow at a slower rate than in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   During the first eleven months last year, construction of
single-family homes jumped by 12.6 percent to 115,456, according to
the board, with a November rate that was the highest since December
1992.
</P>
<P>
   A larger share of the new construction should be in the southern
part of the state, especially in Los Angeles and San Bernardino
counties, Bartolotto said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 12 to 15 percent increase in those areas would not be
difficult to achieve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Gibson, chief economist for the California Department of
Finance, said the forecast for residential building is reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   From 1946 to 1990, an average of 200,000 housing units got built
in the state each year. That dropped to 111,716 in 1997 and about
124,800 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're off the bottom, which was 84,000 units in '93, but we're
still a long way from where we had been historically,'' Gibson said
about residential construction.

OWNERS, PLAYERS SETTLE NBA LOCKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With an eleventh-hour bargaining session and major
concessions made from both sides, the NBA and its players union
finally struck a deal that will save the rest of the 1998-99
season.
</P>
<P>
   The six-year collective bargaining agreement was struck around 3
a.m. PST Wednesday, just 29 hours before the league's Board of
Governors was set to vote on canceling the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of what we wanted,'' union director Billy Hunter
said, ``and they got the relief they were looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Said NBA Commissioner David Stern, ``I will say that I am elated
that we will be playing basketball this season.''
</P>
<P>
   The league will attempt to have its 29 teams play a 50- to
52-game schedule, beginning the first week in February. Training
camps could begin as early Jan. 18. A regular season consists of 82
games.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 players convened at a midtown office building on Day
191 of the lockout for what was supposed to be a vote on the
league's final proposal. Instead, players were voting on the
agreement reached between Stern and Hunter following an all-night
secret meeting at NBA headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal Billy struck with David (Tuesday) night is different
than the league's final offer,'' said Sonics center Jim McIlvaine,
who is the union's secretary/treasurer. ``This deal was worth
recommending to the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Players accepted the agreement almost unanimously, with only
five ``no'' votes among the 184 cast.
</P>
<P>
   The league's Board of Governors is expected to accept the deal
today. Union officials said it could take up to two weeks to
finalize the agreement and officially end the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of high-profiled absentees such as Michael
Jordan, Karl Malone and Gary Payton, the union's turnout was
well-rounded. Star players Shaquille O'Neal, David Robinson and
Charles Barkley were in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   However, rank-and-file members such as Philadelphia's Eric Snow,
Detroit's Jerome Williams and Chicago's Steve Kerr clearly were in
the majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to play,'' Snow said as he left the building.
</P>
<P>
   To a man, everyone agreed the minimum-to-middle income players
came out the biggest winners overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all thrilled,'' Kerr said. ``The concessions on the
exceptions and minimum salaries were considerably improved, which
help the middle class. That was our aim from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of the agreement include:
</P>
<P>
   The union agreed to accept 55 percent of revenues in the fourth,
fifth and sixth years of the agreement. Players would get 57
percent in the seventh year if the owners picked up the option. In
the first three years, there is no limit on the percentage of
revenues players can receive.
</P>
<P>
   A $14 million annual maximum salary for players with 10 years'
experience. Players with six to nine years' experience can get $11
million, and players with less than six years can get a maximum of
$9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The union agreed to a three-year rookie scale with teams holding
an option for the fourth year and the right of first refusal in the
fifth year.
</P>
<P>
   The league accepted the union's proposal for an average salary
exception and median salary exception, with both being phased in
during the next three years. As a result, every team will have the
right to sign two additional players each season, even if they are
over the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   The league conceded that annual allowable salary increases will
be 12 percent for players with Larry Bird rights _ those free
agents re-signed by a team without regard to the salary cap _ and
10 percent for others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-end players sacrificed and I admire them for doing
that,'' agent Arn Tellem said. ``Both sides worked hard, now you
move on and live with the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   No professional sports union had ever agreed to a maximum salary
before. No North American sports league had every missed an entire
season due to labor problems, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to take your hits,'' Minnesota's Tom Gugliotta said.
``But overall I think it's best for the league.''
</P>
<P>
   A total of 437 games have already been lost because of the
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the NBA had rejected the players' ``final'' proposal.
Owners and players have been at odds over how to divide $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides had been far apart on limiting top players'
salaries; on the amount of money going into an escrow account; on a
rookie salary scale; and on exceptions to teams' salary caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our big push, which we didn't think was accomplished in the
league's final proposal, was for the middle-class players,''
McIlvaine said. ``We were able to get the pool to keep teams from
signing veterans to minimum salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got average player salary exceptions and minimum exceptions
that will create spaces in caps for middle-class guys. The rookies
and superstars, who ironically everybody said was holding up the
deal, took the biggest hit.''
</P>
<P>
   With the pressure mounting, Hunter left his negotiating
committee to take a walk late Tuesday. Unknown to his staff, Hunter
phoned Stern to set up a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just called him and said `David do you feel like talking?
And he said `I'm always willing to talk to you.' So I said let's
get it together,'' Hunter said.

EX-WYATT STAR WESLEY HAS ANOTHER DETOUR ON ROAD TO TCU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ Former Fort Worth Wyatt High School defensive back
Demario Wesley said he has failed to qualify academically and
therefore will be unable to enroll at TCU for spring classes.
</P>
<P>
   He signed with TCU last February, although, his standardized
test scores prevented him from enrolling last fall. He had been
planning to enroll at TCU when spring-semester classes begin in two
weeks if he had achieved the NCAA minimum score on his ACT.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley said instead he will attend Paul Quinn College, an NAIA
school in Dallas, and participate in track, with hopes of becoming
eligible and transferring to TCU next January.
</P>
<P>
   He could have enrolled at TCU as a partial qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to go to school,'' Wesley said. ``I haven't been
doing anything. I want to go to Quinn so I can transfer to TCU and
be eligible.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesley signed with TCU as a defensive back and track athlete.
His signing highlighted TCU coach Dennis Franchione's first
recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get to TCU,'' Wesley promised.
SEEN ON CAMPUS
</P>
<P>
   TCU had a visitor walking around Daniel-Meyer Coliseum on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He's not just any visitor, though.
</P>
<P>
   He's 6-foot-7, 220-pound Myron Anthony, a forward from Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking to transfer,'' Anthony said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony played on Kentucky's 1998 national championship team as
a freshman, averaging 2.3 points and 1.2 rebounds a game. He began
this season with Kentucky, only to quit because of a lack of
playing time.
</P>
<P>
   He announced his intention to transfer on Dec. 3, and says he's
considering TCU and Florida State. He's originally from
Jacksonville, Fla. where Frogs assistant coach Rob Flaska coached
junior college.
BIG WEEKEND
</P>
<P>
   Say this for Franchione, he has impeccable timing.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off TCU's biggest victory in years, a 28-19 Sun Bowl
victory over Southern California, Franchione has scheduled his
biggest recruiting weekend.
</P>
<P>
   TCU has between 12 to 15 recruits coming in, including two area
players in Cleburne's Quentus Cumby and Crowley's Corey Connally.
Did you know? All season long folks talked of Franchione's team
with wistful sentences that usually began ... if TCU only had had a
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   A quarterback? Imagine for a second if TCU had had Purdue
quarterback Drew Brees.
</P>
<P>
   It was possible.
</P>
<P>
   Brees, an Austin Westlake High School product, apparently wanted
to sign with TCU in 1997. But Brees went to Purdue instead, and
went a measly 19-for-43 with an interception in his freshman
season.
</P>
<P>
   He called TCU last spring, wanting to transfer. Franchione
declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't sure what we'd be getting,'' Franchione said, ``and
we weren't sure he'd fit in to this offense.''
</P>
<P>
   So Brees stayed at Purdue, finishing his sophomore season with
3,983 yards and 39 touchdowns and setting Purdue and Big Ten marks
in attempts, completions, yards and touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   He also had that little detail of leading Purdue to an upset of
Kansas State in the Alamo Bowl.
WHO NEEDS SLEEP?
</P>
<P>
   TCU's defense held Southern Cal to an all-time low of minus-23
yards rushing and played a big role in TCU's upset.
</P>
<P>
   A pretty good showing, considering that Frogs defensive
coordinator Gary Patterson estimates his sleep time at 10 hours
during bowl week.
</P>
<P>
   His infant son, Blake, had to be hospitalized with pneumonia
while in El Paso. Patterson helped at practice and film sessions by
day, and then stayed with his son overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing better,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   And as for Patterson? Franchione said he has seen Patterson work
on little sleep before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's usually better in situations like that,'' Franchione
said.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Lack of wisdom made Gingrich his own worst enemy
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was no thunder clap when Newt Gingrich recently vacated
the House speakership. Especially considering all the clamor of his
coming, Gingrich's going produced a surprisingly small vacuum. As
hard as Gingrich himself has made it for most of us to care, there
is something sad about that after all, a sense of loss at the
might-have-beens.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich brought a rare and potentially resonant academic
background in history to politics and an appealing zest for the
game. He is uncommonly bright and could have been the author, if he
had wished, of a prudent new conservatism, rethought for changed
times, instead of leading his party as he did into a conservatism
of permanent hellraising.
</P>
<P>
   For all his political street smarts, however, Gingrich lacked
the one thing that could have made him something more than just a
partisan firebrand. He lacked wisdom, and lacking it he was the
constant victim of his own momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich never failed to rescue himself from his few lapses into
statesmanship, and his famous love of ideas was more like a series
of one-night stands. Much of the unforgiving partisanship of
current politics bears his fingerprints, beginning with the
infamous C-SPAN appearances in which the young congressman seemed
bravely to be reading the ideological riot act to a chastened House
of wasted hacks, when in fact he was only grandstanding before an
empty chamber.
</P>
<P>
   His cruelty _ yes, that's the right word _ and his cynicism were
never more plain than in his personal destruction of Democratic
House Speaker Jim Wright over nothing worse than a handful of petty
misfeasances.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich went on to tutor a rising generation of Republican
rightwingers in the politics of defamation, counseling them when
referring to Democrats to use such words as ``sick,'' ``traitor''
and ``pathetic'' while associating themselves with words like
``humane'' and ``moral.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson took, alas, and the GOP House majority that Gingrich
engineered in 1994 brought a new cadre of rightwing zealots into
play _ who wasted little time turning on Gingrich himself as now
insufficiently zealous and rightwing. The only justice in their
indictment was poetic.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress are political creatures, but usually more as
well. Most come to Congress wanting, say, to reform the tax code or
upgrade education. Even those who come innocent of much purpose
except their own installation develop an interest _ in the
environment, the military, foreign policy _ and can look back at
the end on a body of purposeful legislation or some trail of useful
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich went to Congress in 1978. He buzzed every major
issue of his time but when you look for any sustained interest you
find only politics itself, and that of an especially poisonous
sort. The meanness we find ourselves in now descends in a line from
Red-baiting Richard Nixon through race-baiting George Wallace to
liberal- (and moderate- !) baiting Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who had meant to leave his mark on the era, leaves
mainly wounds instead.

   1. THE RACE UP THE ALPS : SNOW AT THE PUSH OF A BUTTON Winter
resorts in the Alps, increasingly fearful of the results of global
warming, are investing massively in new higher-altitude projects
and costly snow cannon. They want tourists to know they can always
find snow whenever they come. The expansion is expensive, and
carries risks to the Alpine ecology. But after 1998, the
third-warmest year in more than a century, pro-expansion forces are
finding it easy to carry the day. From Der Spiegel. 800 words.
(English translation available.)

SEARCH FOR CAUSE OF DIET PILLS' RISK YIELDS NEW WARNINGS A
prescription diet drug and some over-the-counter cold medicines
contain ingredients that may be unsafe if taken together with the
antidepressent Prozac or similar drugs, researchers are reporting.
They recommend that product labels be changed to warn consumers of
the possible risks. By Denise Grady. New York Times Science Times.

SUCCESS AND THE SINGLE MOTHER We hear about the ``plight'' of the
single mother all the time. She's alone. She's broke. She's
exhausted. But you probably know at least one single mother who
defies that stereotype. She's focused and in charge; her kids are
thriving and happy. By Melinda Blau. From Child magazine. 1,300

COMPUTERS USED TO ANALYZE DOCTOR-PATIENT CONVERSATIONS Patients
frequently complain that doctors don't explain things to them and
when they do, the explanations are often so laden with medical
jargon that they're nearly incomprehensible. A new study (using a
computer technique called concordancing) found that doctors rarely
used jargon, explained it when they did, and often used language in
subtle ways to reassure patients. By Michael McCarthy. From The

IN A HIGHER STATE OF BEING (THAT IS, DYING)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Franz Lidz, a senior writer for Sports Illustrated, is the author
of ``Unstrung Heroes.''  
 By FRANZ LIDZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the other end of this decade I wrote a childhood memoir
(``Unstrung Heroes'') that recounted my mother's six-year struggle
with breast cancer. From my ninth birthday, in Year Two, almost
every step she took was a step going down. ``Her hospital stays
were becoming longer and longer,'' I recalled. ``I measured them by
the nights that she was away. And I didn't like it now when she was
home. She had become unpredictable. She wasn't dying like some
movie heroine. She could be sullen and bad-tempered. I resented
her.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet when Disney adapted the book for the screen in 1995, my
mother, Selma, was shown dying (italics)exactly(end italics) like a
movie heroine. No anguished outbursts. No unkind thoughts. No
endless days lying mute and tubed and suctioned in grim hospital
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   My mother's celluloid counterpart (Andie McDowell) was a secular
saint whose main cancer symptom was that she tripped over
furniture. What I had described as a long, painful, ugly death was
made quick, painless, almost pretty. On film, the more the cancer
spread, the more luminous my mother became, as if she were
pregnant, not ill.
</P>
<P>
   The way Disney spun cotton candy around my mother's suffering
reminded me of Ali MacGraw's blissful description of her six-minute
struggle with cancer in ``Love Story'' (1970). ``It doesn't hurt,
Ollie, really it doesn't,'' Ms. MacGraw, as Jenny, told her husband
(Ryan O'Neal). ``It's like falling off a cliff in slow motion. Only
after a while you wish you hit the ground already.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Disney killed off my mother _ after fixing pancakes, she
praises her kids, plants a perversely passionate kiss on her
husband's lips and, to soulful strains of ``You Are My Sunshine,''
drifts off to die in a comfy armchair _ reminded me of Mad
magazine's send-up of ``Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of cancer, the diagnosis for Ms. MacGraw's character was
Old Movie Disease. ``In the old days, they used to die beautiful
glamorous deaths!'' a cartoon oncologist tells O'Neal. ``Your wife
is going to die such a beautiful death, it'll take your breath away
before it takes her breath away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big C has always been a fruitful subgenre of Old Movie
Diseases. Actresses from Bette Davis (``Dark Victory,'' brain
tumor, 1939) to Debra Winger (``Terms of Endearment,'' lymphoma,
1983) to Diane Keaton (``Marvin's Room,'' leukemia, 1997) have
received Oscar nominations for playing cancer victims.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Hollywood divas to brave cancer on the screen are
Meryl Streep (``One True Thing'') and Susan Sarandon (``Stepmom'').
Both play well-off, middle-aged domestic goddesses, but only Ms.
Streep is made to look ravaged by the disease. Her skin pale gray,
her eyes rimmed red like a Kabuki's, she becomes so gaunt and frail
that in the film's most affecting scene, she has to be lifted out
of the bathtub by her daughter. Reduced to a miserable shell, she
weeps, rages, endures Bette Midler songs and yet _ inevitably _
maintains her nobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terminal illnesses can inspire voyeurism,'' Jackson Peyton, a
public health consultant in Washington, said in a telephone
interview. ``Unable to find meaning in their own lives, some people
seek it through the drama of the fatal sicknesses of others. But
the hard reality of dying is brutally disappointing. For the most
part, the deaths of cancer victims don't play out like characters
in 19th-century novels or 20th-century films. The truth is that
most suffer terribly, and many unload their bitterness on their
loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Old Movie Disease-driven films support their romantic agendas by
evading and overlooking hard realities. The chaos and horror of
cancer are papered over with sentiment and sanctimony, then
packaged as a higher state of being. Hollywood cancer mutates
ordinary people into angelic beings who straighten out the lives of
all the mixed-up souls around them.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Marvin's Room,'' the selfless Ms. Keaton draws on an
inexhaustible fund of goodness to teach her selfish sister (Ms.
Streep) to be more humane. In ``One True Thing,'' the upright Ms.
Streep is sacrificed so that her icily ambitious daughter (Renee
Zellweger) can learn ``life lessons'' and turn compassionate
caregiver. In ``Stepmom,'' cancer works curative wonders on Ms.
Sarandon's prickly perfect homemaker. She remains hostile toward
her ex-husband's trophy wife-to-be (Julia Roberts) until,
succumbing to the dynamics of the honeyed plot and repeated dosings
of her own cancer theme song (``Ain't No Mountain High Enough''),
she wearily slouches toward canonization.
</P>
<P>
   The more advanced the cancer, the more potent its redemptive
powers. Terminal cancer trumps a relatively benign strain in ``The
Doctor,'' a 1991 tearjerker in which William Hurt sinks from lordly
physician to lowly patient. Stricken with a treatable form of
throat cancer, the chilly, insensitive heart surgeon befriends a
fellow patient (Elizabeth Perkins) with an inoperable brain tumor.
This doomed (and, of course, radiant) young woman guides him on one
of those journeys of self-discovery that can begin and end only in
Hollywood. Along the way, he learns to appreciate sunsets, desert
dancing and rooftop pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   Watching this once heartless cardiologist transform into a
benevolent St. Francis, replete with birds, I was reminded of
another exchange in Mad's spoof. The oncologist tells a shaken Ryan
O'Neal: ``I'm afraid it's out of our hands.'' ``You mean medical
science is powerless?'' O'Neal asks. ``What medical science!? I'm
talking about (italics)cinema(end italics) science! Think back!
What have we got so far? A corny soap-opera plot! Unbelievable
dialogue! A schmaltzy piano music background! Can't you see? If the
producer doesn't have a tragic, sobbing ending to make all this
garbage seem meaningful, he's got absolutely nothing!''
</P>
<P>
   Someday somebody may find a cure for cancer, but the terminal
sappiness of cancer movies is probably beyond remedy.

A LEGEND CAPTURED IN FIVE SETS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBERT GRESKOVIC   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   THE DORIS HUMPHREY LEGACY
</P>
<P>
   (italics)``Air For the G String,'' ``The Call/Breath of Fire,''
``Water Study,'' ``The Shakers,'' ``Two Ecstatic Themes'' Dance
Horizons Video, $79.95 each; complete set of 5 videos: $375.
Information: (800) 220-7149(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Five recently released video cassettes concerning the dances of
Doris Humphrey come variously described. The packaging lists them
as ``Coaching, Analysis and Performance.'' A press release suggests
``Appreciation and Coaching Documentaries.'' Speaking the same,
somewhat awkward introduction at the start of each video, Stephanie
Clemens, a dancer and the executive director of the Doris Humphrey
National Society, refers to them as ``instructional videos.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they are all these things. A consistent format
presents commentary and rehearsal with coaching sessions for each
dance, followed by a finished performance of the work. While all of
the dances are under 10 minutes long, four of the cassettes run
approximately 90 minutes and one runs just over 60.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, a pioneer of American modern dance, began her career
in the 1920s and continued working until her death in 1958.
Describing the dances preserved here as ``choreographic
masterpieces'' sounds more than a little hyperbolic since they all
date from 1928 through 1931, Humphrey's earliest years in the field
as a choreographer and teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the dance maker's contribution to her art remains worth
considering and, given the evanescence of choreography, the future
must often settle for what's retrievable, masterwork or not.
</P>
<P>
   The guiding force of this series is Ernestine Stodelle, who
danced for Humphrey during the years in which these five dances
were made. Now in her mid-80s, the elegant and energetic Ms.
Stodelle introduces each dance with historical and analytical
commentary, then proceeds to direct, coach and work hands-on with
the mostly student dancers learning the individual dances.
</P>
<P>
   The working sessions that make up the biggest portion of each
tape consistently include captions to spell out the particular
points of interest being stressed about Humphrey's ways with dance
and choreography. Ms. Clemens's introductory remarks remind the
viewer that, to Humphrey, ``movement without a motivation was
unthinkable.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tedium of point-by-point, show-and-tell sessions between
dancers and their director wears on the viewer to a greater or
lesser degree, depending on one's particular interest or expertise
in the work at hand. The cassettes documenting ``Air for the G
String,'' a female quintet to Bach, and ``The Call/Breath of
Fire,'' a solo to piano music by Dane Rudhyar, each include
historical film footage in which Humphrey herself dances.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stodelle comments on the old films and their limitations as
records of the dance she is coaching. There is also recognition of
the need for ``educated guessing'' in the case of works without
longstanding performance histories. Humphrey's innovative ``Water
Study,'' a 1928 ensemble work using only the dancers' breathing and
ambient sounds for accompaniment, has choreography qualified as the
``Stodelle Version.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some of the student dancers involved in the project offer
little more than dutiful results, others shine. The statuesque
Sarita Smith-Childs, who is taught ``Two Ecstatic Themes,'' takes
her tuition to heart and performs the Humphrey solo with rich
plasticity and haunting beauty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, each video is a kind of case study that looks in on
the complicated process of bringing to a new generation of dancers
(and audiences) a dance from a former day. One of Humphrey's most
quotable quotes asserts that ``all dances are too long.''
</P>
<P>
   In their ways, brief choreographic works are ideal for such
documentaries. Even though these tapes present edited footage of
the complete rehearsals, the fact that the dances themselves are
relatively short makes it possible to give a sense of them and
their inner workings in the space of single video tape.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Reusch, the videographer who filmed and edited the series,
does valiant work even in the face of body microphones that fade in
and out and a studio with distractions in the background.

MUSEUMS EXPERIMENT WITH NEW EXHIBITION STRATEGIES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Marcia Tucker is the founding director of the New Museum of
Contemporary Art in New York.  
 By MARCIA TUCKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is reported that more people in America today go to museums
than to sporting events; those of us in the field make a great
effort to find out who these museumgoers are, where they come from
and why they're here. When we ask our audiences what they want (and
we do this all the time, even if we don't always act on the
answers), they say over and over again that it's to feel some
connection between the art they see and their everyday lives.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the best ideas for making our holdings and programs
accessible and meaningful to a public that is increasingly diverse
_ and often feels left out by major cultural organizations _ have
come from museum educators, who are being summoned from their
basement cubicles to take part in curatorial planning and
implementation.
</P>
<P>
   Effective models have emerged from such collaborations, giving
momentum to rethinking, at all levels, what a museum is and how it
functions best.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar of these efforts involves inviting outsiders,
especially artists, to reinstall and reinterpret the museum's
permanent collections. While these are often small-scale
experiments, using only a gallery or two, they serve the valuable
purpose of giving the public a glimpse of both objects and
conventional museum practice through artists' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, for example, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in
Boston has sponsored an artist-in-residence and lecture series,
inviting luminaries like Juan Munoz, Faith Ringgold, Henry Louis
Gates Jr. and Elizabeth Swados to respond publicly to its holdings,
thereby helping visitors see how historical works relate to
present-day artistic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, the artist Abelardo Morell provided a single
context for past and present portraiture in an exhibition called
``Face to Face: Photographs at the Gardner Museum.'' In 1995, the
Museum of Modern Art in New York invited the painter Elizabeth
Murray to participate in a series called ``Artist's Choice''; she
mounted a dense, informative and highly charged exhibition of 130
works by 70 women, most of which were in the museum's permanent
collection but were rarely if ever shown.
</P>
<P>
   In the small town of Hagen, Germany, the enterprising and
offbeat Karl Ernst Osthaus-Museum, under the directorship of
Michael Feher, recently invited the Los Angeles-based artist David
Wilson to install a permanent branch of his ``Museum of Jurassic
Technology,'' a lifelong project, as a ``museum within a museum.''
This deadpan display of scientific artifacts, esthetic curiosities
and arcane documentation startles, confounds and delights viewers
daily.
</P>
<P>
   Often, artists' interventions can lead the way to improved
communication within the departments of the museum itself. When
Timothy Anglin Burgard, curator of American art at the Fine Arts
Museums of San Francisco, invited a series of contemporary artists
to participate in a four-part, interdisciplinary show, the
resulting ``Art of the Americas'' crossed departmental boundaries
and, as he puts it, ``demonstrated that chronology, nationality and
media are not always the most logical or most useful organizing or
educational principles.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the artist Fred Wilson was given the run of the entire
Seattle Art Museum, rearranging, relabeling and adding or
subtracting pieces to bring to light information usually left out
or ignored by traditional exhibition methods. The resulting
project, ``The Museum: Mixed Metaphors,'' was witty, controversial
and unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson undermined the idea that the art of certain cultures
exists only in the past by scattering videos made by contemporary
Native American artists and writers throughout the galleries
devoted to historical Indian art and artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   To a display of traditional African robes, tapestries and
carvings, Wilson added a model of contemporary male business attire
_ suit, shirt and tie _ accompanied by a wry, museologically
correct label explaining the business suit's function as an
indicator of rank in status-conscious African cities.
</P>
<P>
   By adapting the installation style traditionally used to show
African ceremonial objects to a group of modernist works from the
first half of this century, he demonstrated how dramatically their
meaning can be altered by presentation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to artists, independent curators have been
instrumental in opening museums to some fresh air. ``Do It,'' an
exhibition organized by the peripatetic Hans Ulrich Obrist and
replicated in numerous venues throughout the world, radically
altered and reoriented the usual relationship between artists and
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Composed solely of artists' instructions to be carried out by
the public and documented and destroyed at the end of the show, the
exhibition included the following: Felix Gonzalez-Torres's
directive, ``Get 180 lbs. of a local wrapped candy and drop in a
corner''; Alison Knowles's invitation to divide the exhibition
floor into squares, putting one red thing into each square until
the entire floor is covered; and Ben Kinmont's deceptively simple
request, ``Invite a stranger into your home for breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   Other vanguard curators, like Jerome Sans in Paris, Mary Jane
Jacob in Chicago and Ihor Holubizky, formerly of the Art Gallery of
Hamilton, Ontario, work both inside and outside arts institutions
on projects that equip the public with tools for critical thinking
and encourage community involvement in the creation and
presentation of art.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jacob's ``Conversations at the Castle,'' a series of open
dialogues about art during the Olympic Games in Atlanta, Sans's use
of answering machines, newspaper inserts and shop windows as
exhibition venues, and Holubizky's cross-disciplinary and
cross-historical examinations of traditional themes like the still
life and the vanitas all challenge the museum's authority, offer
alternative interpretations and devolve a share of institutional
responsibility onto the public.
</P>
<P>
   Museum staff members themselves are a powerful force in creating
new exhibition strategies. For ``The Label Show'' at the Boston
Museum of Fine Arts in 1995, Trevor Fairbrother, then a curator,
invited viewers as well as artists, critics and staff members to
write the wall labels and expository texts that made up the show.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a project at the Chrysler Museum of Art in Norfolk,
Va., provided a psychologist-led counseling session _ sold out,
incidentally _ for viewers of Mary Motley Kalergis's exhibition of
photographs about married couples.
</P>
<P>
   At the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, a five-year exhibition
and community-project initiative called ``A Place for All People,''
financed by the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Foundation, entailed a
series of collaborations. The museum's 300 staff members, joined by
artists, high school students and teachersand a group of
Houstonians including a city councilman, a community volunteer, an
orthopedic surgeon and the rector of a nearby church, re-examined
the museum's collections, interpreted them from their own
experience and knowledge, created artworks and organized
exhibitions both inside and outside the museum.
</P>
<P>
   While it may not have been to everyone's liking, Peter Marzio,
the museum's director, found that the project not only ``taught the
museum to listen'' but also enabled it to develop new, mutually
beneficial relationships with its audiences.
</P>
<P>
   A focus on youth has enlivened the Walker Art Center in
Minneapolis, the Aldrich Museum in Ridgefield, Conn., and the New
Museum in New York, three institutions that have long-term programs
with teen-agers. Young people are used as advisers, docents,
publications producers and even exhibition organizers, thereby
encouraging the next generation to feel at home with contemporary
art.
</P>
<P>
   As with any challenge to the foundations of a field, the usual
plaints arise: ``But is it art?'' ``If it does these kinds of
things, is it really a museum?'' Such questions were once raised
about the ``experimental'' theater of the 1960s, when the work of
the directors Jerzy Grotowski in Poland and Peter Brook in England
and groups like the Living Theater, Mabou Mines or the Open Theater
in the United States challenged convention and closed the distance
between actors and audience.
</P>
<P>
   Having actors leave the proscenium stage to mingle with viewers,
for example, afforded audiences an invigorating (and occasionally
threatening) sense of engagement and participation.
</P>
<P>
   Such ideas had no place in museums, however, until very
recently. Marzio describes their attitude in his introduction to
the catalogue for ``A Place for All People.'' ``In the past,'' he
points out, ``there has been a tendency among large, encyclopedic
art museums to assume they have a monopoly on high art, good taste
and esthetic standards. They have treated art as if it were a
powerful but bad-tasting medicine that the less knowledgeable
members of the public should be forced to drink. `We know what is
good for you' could have been engraved on the facades of most of
our buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, there's no 11th Commandment that says museums must
be limited to hushed and hallowed halls enshrining past creations,
or that the only true experience of art is a solitary,
contemplative and reverential one. When they succeed, revisions and
incursions into traditional museum practice encourage visitors to
participate in the creative process, and to have a role in how
exhibitions are conceived, presented and viewed, thus positioning
them not as passive consumers but as active collaborators in the
production of culture.
</P>
<P>
   And when they fail? Well, it can feel a little bit like being
back in kindergarten. But isn't that where we all started, after
all?

   DESIGN-MCCARTNEY _ Internationally acclaimed designer Heather
McCartney launches a new line of decorative accessories at
Atlanta's International Gift &AMP; Home Furnishings Market Thursday,
and her dad, Paul, of Beatles fame will be on hand to cheer her on.
The designer, the late Linda McCartney's daughter by a previous
marriage, will unveil a new collection of handmade ceramics during
a 5 p.m. press conference, followed by a private reception. The
McCartneys aren't the only British in town for the biannual
wholesale market, open only to the trade. Officials from the Royal
Botanic Garden, Kew, in London are here to announce an alliance
with the market's sponsor, AmericasMart, to save thousands of
endangered species of plants. Through licensing agreements with
hundreds of manufacturers, a portion of the proceeds from garden
products will be donated to the Millennium Seed Bank, a
conservation program. An exhibition highlighting the program is on
display throughout the market, after which it will be donated to
the Atlanta Botanical Garden. Will have story and photos for all
editions. (Flanders, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18-20. WITH

 &HT;    `Miseducation' provides a lesson for artist
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So this is what five years of buzz gets you: 10 Grammy
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   How could you not know Lauryn Hill by now? Or at the least heard
her, seen her or something?
</P>
<P>
   Since Hill first hit the music scene in 1994 in a rap act called
Fugees, record buyers and music critics alike have been clamoring
for her to put out her own record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of hurt to hear every other person say `That girl's
got the talent,''' Fugee Wyclef Jean recalls. `` Or `That girl
should leave those guys.'''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't. Hill wisely stuck with Jean and his cousin Pras to
craft the 1996 hip-hop effort ``The Score,'' which won two Grammy
Awards and became the best-selling album by a rap group (17
million). The trio's biggest single on that album, a
reggae-inflected cover of R&AMP;B vocalist Roberta Flack's ``Killing Me
Softly,'' served as an introduction of sorts to Hill, a singular
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going for the vocal rafters to compete with the
Celine Dions and Mariah Careys of the world, Hill swirls around in
calming, accessible midranges best exemplified on her first solo
single, ``The Sweetest Thing,'' from the 1997 ``love jones''
soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   But like Dion, Hill seemed a Grammy shoo-in of ``Titanic''
proportions, thanks to her 3 million-selling solo album, ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' released in August.
</P>
<P>
   It's earned her nods for album of the year, new artist, female
pop vocal, female R&AMP;B vocal, R&AMP;B performance by a duo or group
(with D'Angelo), R&AMP;B song (two nominations in one category), R&AMP;B
album, rap solo performance and producer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Miseducation'' obviously travels numerous genres, it
essentially comes from a soul older than Hill's 23 years. Maybe
it's because she is already a mother of two. Or could it have
something to do with the fact that as a child she slept on the
floor just to be near her turntable?
</P>
<P>
   The way Hill explains it: ``I just put all my loves on this
record and in this record.''
</P>

 &HT;    DREAMSVILLE: Doing the bop in Tishomingo, Okla.
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (''Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in which readers share
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   N. Loutrelle Williams has come a long way from Tishomingo, Okla.
_ ``to Los Angeles, Montana, Dallas and various other places'' _ in
search of her dreams. Never mind that she ended up in Antlers,
Okla., just 75 miles from her childhood hometown. Here's her story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happened to Randolph Scott? I think he and some of my
other old acquaintances might still be sighted if I sat quietly in
the old picture show on a Saturday afternoon:
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy Rogers and Gene Autry may still ride the range. Joan
Crawford may still be there, tough and dramatic, and Ava Gardner,
soft and sexy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I picture my hometown of Tishomingo in my mind, the
Thompson Theater pops into view there on Main Street. Other
landmarks appear as readily:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our old swimming hole, the Millpond; the soda fountain behind
the big glass window in Cobb drugstore; the U-turn signs at the
east and west ends of Main Street. These were the boundaries of my
youth, my world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't wait to get our driver's license and join the
Saturday night parade down Main Street, starting at dusk and
continuing until preview time, 10:45 p.m., at the picture show.
Everybody had dates for the pre-showing of the Sunday movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in the Thompson Theater that I first held hands with a
boyfriend. His name was George.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie was 'She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.' The following Monday
at school most of the 13- and 14-year-old girls wore yellow scarves
or ribbons for that 'certain someone.'
</P>
<P>
   ``No X-rated movie today can compare to the sexual tension and
excitement present when George's arm dropped and his hand slowly,
ever so slowly, snaked over my arm, and his hand closed on mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those good old days, our summers were spent at Millpond in
one-piece bathing suits with modesty flaps. The beach was littered
with towels and bottles of baby oil laced with iodine. Someone had
a portable radio playing loudly such hits as 'Jambalaya!' or
'Maybelline.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys vied to perform the best swan dives and half-gainers,
while we girls lay on our towels and admired them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later, we all piled into somebody's car and drove to the
drugstore for cherry limes, vanilla Cokes or milkshakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``From grammar school on, we dreamed our dreams of going to the
moon, or to New York City _ both seemed equally removed from
Tishomingo. Some of us simply dreamed of a house, two children, two
cars and a boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In search of my dreams, I moved to Los Angeles, Montana,
Dallas and various other places. But whenever I felt crowded or
stressed or lonesome, wherever I was, I turned to memories of my
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my best reveries, I'm dancing a jitterbug or a bop on a
sandy beach. There is a watermelon chilling in Millpond.''

   IMMIGRANT-TRAIN (San Antonio) _ Jose Delfino Castorena crossed
the border with a dream of making enough money in the United States
to open a store in his hometown in Mexico. But that dream was
shattered when he fell from a train and was sucked under the rail
cars, crushing both his arms. By JOSEPH BARRIOS. (For release
Sunday, Jan. 10.)
</P>
<P>
   IMMIGRANT-MEDICS (San Antonio) _ Dr. Richard Howard knew the
decision he made might be called radical by some physicians. But
after seeing Jose Delfino Castorena's severed arms, the orthopedic
surgeon knew the illegal immigrant's only hope was a cross-arm
transfer _ attaching Castorena's left forearm and left hand to his
right forearm stump. By JIM HUTTON. (For release Sunday, Jan. 10.)

   CALIF-SCHOOLS (San Francisco) _ A massive study of the nation's
public schools paints a grim picture of student performance and
concludes that most states, including California, have yet to
establish policies that identify and turn around failing schools.
By JULIAN GUTHRIE.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-GOVERNOR (Sacramento, Calif.) _ The state legislature got
its first taste of what California's self-proclaimed centrist
governor wants _ and it sounded a lot like Republican ex-Gov. Pete
Wilson, give or take a few new ideas. By ROBERT SALLADAY and
ZACHARY COILE.
</P>
<P>
   FEATURES/LIFESTYLE (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   COLORED-GLASS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Colored glass always has provided
a fascination for the collector, especially the rich red of ruby
glass. This type of glass, in which metallic oxides are used to
create colors, is also known as Bohemian glass. By FRANCES
INGRAHAM.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   MAC-DESIGN (San Francisco) _ ``Delicious.'' Hardly a word used
to describe a computer. But that's the adjective Apple interim CEO
Steve Jobs blurted out as he unwrapped the five candy-colored iMacs
during his flashy MacWorld Expo keynote speech. The colors _
blueberry, grape, tangerine, lime and strawberry _ are the latest
incarnations of the top-selling ocean teal iMac, which debuted Aug.
15. By MATT BEER.
</P>
<P>
   MAC-PERIPHERALS (San Francisco) _ As they say in the fashion
world, there are three rules to looking hot: accessorize,
accessorize and _ wait for it _ accessorize. That's the mantra at
this week's MacWorld Expo, where accessories for the curvy teal
green iMac dot the convention floor. By MATT BEER.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD (``d'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FOOD-FREEZERS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Keeping foods frozen today is a
snap. Freezers have become economical, energy-saving conveniences.
If you simply have a large family or entertain a lot, you might
consider investing in or trading up to a new chest or upright
freezer _ for the sole purpose of freezing food in quantity. By
FRANCES INGRAHAM. (For release Sunday, Jan. 10.)
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TV-PJS (Undated) _ If Eddie Murphy's film career has taught us
anything, it's that he's hit and miss _ with an emphasis on huge
hits and wincing misses. So there was quite a bit of interest in
Murphy coming back to television, this time as the mastermind
behind ``The PJ's,'' the first-ever black animated show on Fox. By
TIM GOODMAN.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   BKN-ANALYSIS (Undated) _ Now that their 191-day financial war
with the players has ended in a lucrative truce, the NBA owners
have to play catch-up with the public. By GWEN KNAPP.
</P>
<P>
   BKN-SETTLEMENT (Undated) _ The NBA is back. Damn. This is a bad
thing because it means that a truncated, cheapened NBA is trying to
pass off 52 games as a legitimate endurance test, and having the
full set of 16-team playoffs with any number of teams at half- or
less-than-half strength because so many players won't be in playing
shape, or even close to it. By RAY RATTO.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-49ERS-OWENS (Santa Clara, Calif.) _ Terrell Owens came off
the field with tears streaking down his cheeks, same as last year.
But this time, he's made the game-winning catch. His grab of Steve
Young's desperation pass will be etched forever in 49er lore. By
SAMUEL CHI.
</P>
<P>
   FBN-FALCONS (Atlanta) _ The Atlanta Falcons' Terance Mathis and
Tony Martin had numbers that ranked with the best receiving duos in
the NFL, delivered plays when the Falcons needed them, and still,
they fell far down the list of measurable factors in the Falcons'
14-2 season. This is how it works on every successful team. Not
everyone gets to be the hero.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ When I heard that Elizabeth Dole
was quitting the Red Cross to consider a run for the presidency, I
looked up the column I wrote on her speech at the Republican
Convention in 1996. What Liddy Dole did at that convention was make
herself a candidate for president in 2000. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ New York Gov. George Pataki wants
to end parole in New York and to toughen up the juvenile justice
system. That first part of that might be a good idea; I don't know
yet. But these plans really don't get at the problem's heart. With
only a few exceptions, boys grow into violent men for
well-documented reasons. By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ To the chagrin of not a few
scientists, William Shakespeare has emerged in a BBC listeners poll
as Britain's ``man of the millennium,'' beating out two of
science's super-heavyweights, Charles Darwin and Sir Isaac Newton.
By STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   PATAKI-TV (Albany, N.Y.) _ New York Gov. George Pataki will
never be John F. Kennedy. The television does not love him, nor
does Pataki appear at ease speaking before the masses. Pataki, who
delivered his fifth State of the State Address Wednesday has gotten
better over the years. But he wasn't that good to start with, and
odds are he never will be. By MARK McGUIRE.

<P>
   Why does every other shop in the mall these days sell athletic
shoes?
</P>
<P>
   And why do half those shoes cost almost as much as a compact
car?
</P>
<P>
   It may be impossible to say, yet it's easier to answer these
questions: Do you have to spend $150 on your feet? How much of that
cost is fashion, and how much is fitness?
</P>
<P>
   Quality does come at a price, experts advise. If you try to work
out seriously with a pair of cheap imports, you might regret it.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of weekend athletes apparently agree. According to the
National Sports Goods Association, nearly $8 billion is spent each
year in the United States on athletic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you don't have to sell your soul to get the shoes you
need.
</P>
<P>
   For example, David K. Miller, co-author of ``Fitness: A Lifetime
Commitment'' (Allyn and Bacon, 1995), never pays more than $100 for
running shoes _ and he runs between 25 and 50 miles per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most expensive shoe is not always the best shoe,'' said
Miller. By watching for sales, he often finds the shoes he likes
for $50 to $60 per pair.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sprecher, head coach for cross-country and track at the
University of North Carolina at Wilmington, generally spends $40 to
$60 per pair on his athletes' shoes. ``It's the most important
piece of equipment an athlete can have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with expensive shoes, Sprecher added, is that owners
might be tempted to hold onto them too long. Like tires, shoes wear
down after time; the feet lose cushioning and support. Since a
runner's stride hits the surface with a power of 2 1/2 to 3 times
his or her body weight, those feet need a lot of cushioning.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, according to Dr. Michael D. Carter, a sports
medicine specialist in Wilmington, N.C., is that shoes still look
good long after they're effectively worn out.
</P>
<P>
   For those who exercise regularly, then, it's a good idea to buy
modestly priced shoes and replace them regularly, Sprecher said.
For his distance runners, a typical pair might last about 500
miles: ``After that, they'll start to feel a difference,'' he said
_ and that difference might be felt as aches or pains in the knees.
</P>
<P>
   If you work out in a particular sport for three or four hours or
more a week, you probably need athletic shoes, said Carter.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, you need a pair designed specifically for your
event.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mistake, for instance, to use running shoes if you play a
lot of basketball or tennis.
</P>
<P>
   A runner's shoes are designed for continuous forward motion, not
the frequent side-to-side moves under a net or on the court.
Specifically, they're built with a slight incline in the sole;
dodge too fast after a ball, and you could twist an ankle, Carter
warned.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, most footwear chains have moved beyond the days
when ill-trained clerks would push you to buy the top of the line,
said Miller. At ``name-brand'' stores, at least, chances are the
staff will include at least one specialist knowledgeable enough to
help you find what you really need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't buy shoes in the morning,'' Carter said. Your feet
expand gradually during the day, especially after a run or workout,
so it's best to shop after work or after exercising.
</P>
<P>
   And don't expect athletic shoes to ``break in.'' They should fit
well immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons offers these
suggestions for buying athletic shoes:
</P>
<P>
   When trying on a pair, wear the same type of sock you will wear
for that sport, not your dress socks or hose.
</P>
<P>
   You should be able to wiggle all your toes freely. With running
shoes, there ought to be about a thumbnail's space between the big
toe and the toe of the shoe, according to Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Walk or run a few steps in the new pair to make sure they're
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Always relace the shoes before trying them on, making sure you
have even pressure from the bottom to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the grip of your sole is firm. Your heel should not
slip as you walk or run.
</P>
<P>
   The most important factor in shopping for a running shoe, Miller
and Sprecher agreed, is adequate support, particularly for the
mid-sole area.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers will tout ``air'' soles or capsules or gel-based
cushioning, but whatever the material, what's important is whether
the cushioning works.
</P>
<P>
   Cushions generally come in two layers between the sole and foot.
The top cushion should normally be three times the thickness of the
bottom cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Canvas tops are generally not very supportive and may stretch.
Leather is strong but may not allow the feet to ``breathe''
adequately. Thus, the best top material is often nylon or a
nylon-leather combination.
</P>
<P>
   Training shoes will generally be heavier, with thicker soles and
higher heels, than shoes made for competition.
</P>
<P>
   Walking shoes should have a firm heel, good shock absorption, a
smooth tread, and a rocker sole that encourages the natural roll of
the foot.
</P>
<P>
   For longer walks on rough terrain, consider water-resistant
hiking boots. Good boots will have a firm heel, a flexible
forepart, heavily lugged soles for traction, padding around the
ankles and a high, wide toe box.
</P>
<P>
   Court sports _ tennis, basketball and volleyball _ require shoes
that are light and built to take heavy abuse. The key to these
shoes is in the sole, which should be designed specifically for the
sport you'll be playing. For example, serve-and-volley tennis
players may need extra cushioning on the balls of their feet, while
baseline players may need reinforcement on the heels and midfoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hightops'' can provide extra support for the ankles but should
not restrict ankle motion.
</P>
<P>
   For court players, a coach or physician can offer advice on
which sole style will be best.
</P>
<P>
   Aerobic dancers need shoes that are a cross between the
shock-absorbent running shoe and the court shoe with lateral
support. Flexibility in the forepart is especially important.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance or marathon runners _ those who can cover 80 miles
or more in a typical week _ will likely require more specialized,
more reinforced and more expensive shoes than a typical jogger.
</P>
<P>
   Within these guidelines, Miller warned, each individual foot is
different. One runner's perfect fit might not work with another.
Consumers should pay particular attention to pronation, the natural
inward roll of the foot on each step, which can vary considerably
from person to person.
</P>
<P>
   Where one walks or runs might also affect decisions, Miller
added. The ideal surface would be a level dirt road or field, with
plenty of ``give.'' Paved sidewalks or roadways might require more
cushioning. A sandy beach, on the other hand, might have too much
``give,'' which could lead to a painful stretching of the Achilles'
tendons.

BIRDERS IN PARADISE

<P>
   We are 80 miles south of Fort Lauderdale, plodding through
mid-May heat down an abandoned road walled in by a green bramble of
hardwood hammock.
</P>
<P>
   Officially this is the Key Largo Hammock State Botanical Site,
but if you didn't know where to stop along Florida Interstate 905-A
you'd never find this spot. But just the day before in this very
thicket, local birders sighted a La Sagra's flycatcher, a pip of a
bird that's common in the Bahamas but extremely rare in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   We move in a hushed, collective clot, following Jan Pierson. An
affable New Englander with an easy manner, Pierson is a birder of
global experience, first on his own, then as a guide for Austin,
Texas-based Field Guides, the acclaimed bird touring company he
helped found in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson's hands are cupped around his ears and he is peering
into the dense foliage. One of us has a tape recording of the La
Sagra's call. He plays it at intervals, and Pierson listens
intently for the reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``There it is!'' Pierson's voice is low and fast. ``Down low.
Halfway up the tree. There! He's hopped to the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierson sets up a tripod and scope and we each get our chance to
view the flycatcher, a swatch of brown feathers, nonchalantly
ruffling a white breast with a tiny beak.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the van, Pierson says there might be only one or two La
Sagra's sightings a year in South Florida, which is one to two more
sightings than any place else in North America. ``Could there be
others in there?' someone asks. Pierson eyes the wall of foliage
unreeling beside us at 50 mph. ``There could be 50 La Sagra's
flycatchers in there,'' he smiles. ``You just never know what bird
is going to show up where.''
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much sums up the fun of birding.
</P>
<P>
   Most people don't know much about birders, often portrayed as
binocular-toting obsessives who wear funny hats and dash madly
about saying things like, ``What luck! A pair of mangrove
cuckoos!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, many birders do wear funny hats, but only because most of
them have been around long enough to realize the ramifications of
skin cancer. It's also true that many birders keep lists of the
birds they've seen, and some of them are ardent about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``World lists, North American lists, country lists, county
lists, backyard lists,'' said David Pomerantz, a straightforward
New Yorker who was part of our group. ``I read about a birder who
kept a list of birds who landed on his hat.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most birders lists are merely an excuse to get outside,
to travel, to share discoveries with like-minded people and simply
take a keen look at the world around them. Birders notice things
the rest of us don't. Back at the Key Largo site, Pemerantz had
pointed to the low branch of a tree and said to me, ``Look here.''
I saw nothing, then I looked harder and there it was: a tree snail
no bigger than my fingernail, its lovely ivory-white shell wound
with intricate yellow rings.
</P>
<P>
   We rumbled out of Key West harbor the following morning in
starry darkness. By burnt-orange dawn, everybody had scrambled up
to the top deck of the 63-foot Tiburon, our rolling home for the
next three days. Binoculars at the ready, they scanned the skyline.
The Dry Tortugas are 70 miles from Key West. We would be at sea for
nearly six hours. No one wanted to miss anything.
</P>
<P>
   The Tortugas are seven tiny islands, some barely poking above
high tide, that form a fragile circle of coral and sand in the vast
blue of the Gulf of Mexico. In the spring they are the first fleck
of land that northward migrating birds encounter after a long,
open-ocean haul.
</P>
<P>
   Some birds don't make it. Four hours out of Key West, Pierson
had the Tiburon's captain swing over to a tower marking a shoal.
Light green water languidly rose and fell from the tower's legs. A
dozen birds clustered on a guano-stained platform. Among the
seabirds -- brown boobies and frigatebirds -- was a lone cattle
egret waiting stoically to die.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiburon bobbed softly under the piercing sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they put down, they don't usually get up,'' said Pierson
quietly. ``This is the last stop for that cattle egret. He's
migrating and he blew it.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be plenty of dying birds on the Tortugas too,
bedraggled things perched beneath a ceiling of sky into which they
would never again lift off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some birders like birds because they give the idea of
freedom,'' observed one of our group, Everett Knapp, a Midwesterner
with 30 years of birding experience. ``Sort of an elusive idea,
though, because they're not really free.''
</P>
<P>
   A few nights before, a storm front had lashed rain across this
part of the gulf. The storm raised the possibility of a ``fallout''
of birds searching for cover on Garden Key, which lay between us
and the Tortugas. We arrived on the key in mid-afternoon and gave
the white sand beaches nary a glimpse but made a beeline for the
entrance to the ruined fort which dominates the island, crossing
its moat a dim archway to the open-air sward at its center.
</P>
<P>
   Here we found a birder's heaven: Birds were sheltering here in
droves, lighting up the crumbling brick walls like ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was pointing and sucking in their breath. Binoculars
swung this way and that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a redstart!'' said Pierson. ``Winters in the West
Indies. Look at that! That's a primo bird.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a male scarlet tanager!'' exclaimed someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's three male blackpoll warblers fresh from South
America,'' said Pierson. ``Look up! There comes a purple martin!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a cuckoo! Yellow-billed!'' said Pomerantz.
</P>
<P>
   ``A male Cape May warbler!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indigo bunting!''
</P>
<P>
   For over an hour everyone moved about the sward, training
binoculars and scopes into the trees in a sort of euphoric haze.
They peered resolutely into the sky, but no one seemed to notice
the massing black clouds. Thunder rolled. The palm fronds went
still. Gnats lighted on my knuckles. The air went cool, cooler,
cooler, then fat raindrops began to plock down and everyone
returned to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the Tiburon, we gathered in the galley. Through the
windows sheets of rain ran in ribbons across the water toward ghost
sailboats. In the galley there was a drained hush.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, birding is like gold mining,'' drawled John
Huckabee, a lifelong birder from Texas. ``You look, look, look ,
and then you hit something like this and it keeps you coming
back.''

BE A SUCCESS AND LEAVE AT 5
</HEADLINE>
  By BETTY HOLCOMB 
 c.1999 Working Mother 
 North American rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a managing director at Merrill Lynch, Susan Scherbel knows
she has it good. She works full time, but no one clocks her hours;
in fact, no one even monitors where and when she gets her work
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since my first child was born eight years ago, I've pretty
much worked out of my home, getting the job done as I needed to or
wanted to or could,'' she says. In that time, she's had two more
kids and been promoted. She now shows up in the office only when
it's absolutely essential.
</P>
<P>
   How did she cut such a good deal? With her background as an
attorney with a wide-ranging knowledge of both corporate taxes and
the tax aspects of employee benefit plans, she brings an expertise
to many deals that virtually no one else on Wall Street has. ``I'd
like to think that I'd have this arrangement no matter what, but I
wouldn't bet the mortgage on that. The truth is the more
indispensable you are, the more you can distinguish yourself, and
the more likely it is that you can gain some flexibility and still
move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   That's excellent advice, according to consultants and academics
who advise companies on flexible work arrangements. Though some
companies have begun to create new ways to work, most still measure
employees the old-fashioned way, by the clock. ``Many managers
still think if they can see your face, you're productive,'' says
Marcia Brumit Kropf, vice president at Catalyst, a New York City
think tank dedicated to advancing women in the workplace. ``That's
not true, of course. Just being there doesn't mean someone is
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Kropf and other consultants have learned over the years,
it takes a big effort to move managers out of this old mind-set. So
what's a parent to do?
</P>
<P>
   As Scherbel's experience shows, even in the most demanding,
time-intensive careers, there are strategies for achieving success
when you work flexible hours or must leave promptly each day. We
surveyed readers and talked to the experts to come up with tactics
for not only surviving, but thriving if you work with
clock-watchers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make yourself indispensable. As Scherbel found, companies will
go the extra mile for you if you have an important skill that no
one else has. Toni Thompson, an occupational therapist and mother
of two from Lutz, Fla., accomplishes the same thing in another way.
``I take on projects that no one else wants to do. I am developing
a reputation as the one you can count on,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many moms say that they volunteer for special
committees, especially those that mean working with other
departments. That initiative keeps you visible, buffering you from
the misconception that you're not pulling your weight because you
leave at 5 or work flextime. ``People look to you when new projects
come down the pike,'' says one mother who works in the marketing
department of a major corporation. ``Pretty soon, they see you as
someone they really need.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Showcase your productivity. Of course, it won't help to have a
talent or an expertise unless you make people aware of it. ``I
never really used to strut my stuff,'' says Thompson. ``Now I make
a point to talk up the committees I'm on and the projects I'm
doing.'' Not only that, but Thompson is also quick to praise her
co-workers' contributions as well. ``I highlight other people's
work, and that way, I show that I am contributing and also a team
player who appreciates other people's productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Choose the right priorities. Productivity only counts when
you're doing the right stuff, of course. Spending hours on tasks
that don't move the firm's main agenda forward is a waste of time.
If the company's goal is to create a top-of-the-line digital camera
or to make milk the most exciting drink in the grocery store, then
that should be your priority as well, in big ways and small.
</P>
<P>
   If you aren't sure what your boss's priorities are, find out.
``It's critically important to sit down with your manager and have
clear objectives,'' says Joy Bunson, senior vice president of
organizational development at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York
City. ``Once you can focus on outcome, face time is less
important.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, having the right priorities means adapting to your
supervisor's habits and personality quirks. ``My boss is a morning
person,'' says one mom. So she does her best to make sure she's on
time in the morning. ``If I stay after 5 because I came in a bit
late, it doesn't matter to him. It's more important that I am here
on time.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep the focus on work. Make sure that everyone knows you're
committed to working hard during office hours. Many moms note that
they don't waste time socializing during office hours; many skip
lunch to make the most of their time. ``I let my co-workers know
that I do have deadlines,'' says Tanya Mahoney, a fund raiser for
the Dallas chapter of the American Red Cross. ``If there is a
project looming, I let them know that I am not to be bothered, that
my immediate project is the task of the day.'' With that kind of
clear-cut dedication to getting the job done, co-workers are less
likely to question your commitment or productivity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speak up when you have a problem. If you have a conflict that
makes it impossible to arrive on time or forces you to leave a
little early, talk to your supervisor. Otherwise, you're likely to
be seen as someone who doesn't care about your work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to have an open conversation with your boss,''
says Kropf. Frame the issue professionally, showing that your goal
is to be more productive. ``You might say, 'I know the standard
schedule is to be here at 8:30, not 9, but that isn't working for
me. I don't want you to think I'm late because I don't care. I want
to be a good performer, and I'm hoping that we can come up with a
mutually agreeable solution.'''
</P>
<P>
   You can then suggest options, such as skipping lunch or staying
a little later.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take advantage of technology. If you leave at 5, that doesn't
mean you can't still be in touch with co-workers and your boss. Use
a cell phone, voicemail, e-mail, whatever it takes to stay on top
of business that must be done after you leave the office. ``I use
my cell phone to attend meetings after 5 p.m. or before 9 a.m.,''
says one mother. That way, her boss and co-workers don't think of
her as ``leaving early''; instead, they see that she makes every
effort to be a team player.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Scherbel is evidence that a change is already under way.
``When I first started working at home, I tried to keep the
arrangement quiet,'' she says. But now she's extremely comfortable
with it, especially since Merrill Lynch has touted the arrangement
in company newsletters and to the media. Her schedule is now
considered a model, a harbinger of the future. ``I hope that's
true,'' Scherbel says, ``because it seems to be a win-win for
everybody.''

HOW TO HELP A FORGETFUL CHILD 
 BY MARGERY D. ROSEN
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Matthew has always been a sunny, curious child, but in the
past few months he's been so forgetful that my husband and I are
worried,'' says Peggy Simon of Muncie, Ind., who is four months
pregnant with her third child.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy will ask 6-year-old Matthew, her oldest, to do the
simplest thing -- clear his dishes off the table or dump his dirty
socks in the hamper -- and he can't remember to do it. ``This
morning, I asked if he could please bring me the telephone book.
When I went looking for him 15 minutes later, I found him under the
hall table watching a ladybug crawl up the wallpaper. He'd
forgotten all about the phone book.''
</P>
<P>
   During his last school conference, Matt's teacher suggested that
Matt be tested for attention deficit disorder (ADD), since his mind
wanders in class and he rarely hands in a finished homework
assignment. ``Neither she nor I thinks he has ADD, but there are
lots of unanswered questions,'' Peggy continues. ``She'll give the
kids a math packet to complete, but Matt will bring home only the
first page. Or he'll leave his notebook in his cubby so he can't
copy the spelling words.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping track of his possessions is another problem. ``So far
he's lost two baseball caps, a new pair of soccer shin guards, and,
believe it or not, his backpack,'' Peggy reports. ``When we ask him
where something is, he has no clue that he's even lost the item! Or
he'll cry. I can tell he feels bad about disappointing us.''
</P>
<P>
   A few times Matt has even mumbled that he was stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy wouldn't be so frustrated if Matt's absent-mindedness were
an infrequent thing. ``But after a while, you lose your patience.
I've run out of ways to help him,'' she confesses.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy's a believer in time-outs, but they have had no impact on
Matt's forgetfulness. Neither has the system of rewards she
instituted: ``We made a chart of the things he typically forgets to
do, and I offered a sticker for each task he did without a
reminder,'' she recalls. ``After a week he could trade in the
stickers for a toy. But it didn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt's father, Mark, who manages a paint supply business, thinks
Peggy is too lenient. ``He's old enough to keep track of things,''
insists Mark. ``If we didn't let him get away with so much -- Peggy
runs out to buy whatever he loses -- he'd come around. Sometimes I
think he's purposely being defiant.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peggy believes her husband is much too harsh. ``Mark's idea
of solving the problem is to yell and say, 'Shut up!' when Matt
tries to explain himself,'' she protests. As a result, Peggy is
increasingly worried. ``I can't help wondering if Matt's just not
as bright as we thought he was,'' she says. ``Isn't he old enough
to recall simple thing, the first time we ask him?''
</P>
<P>
   The Simons consulted Theresa A. Kruczek, an assistant professor
of counseling psychology at Ball State University in Muncie.
Kruczek's analysis:
</P>
<P>
   A child's forgetfulness, though exasperating, is a normal
behavior that peaks and ebbs throughout childhood. And most parents
react to their offspring's absent- mindedness like the Simons did.
They can't comprehend how a child who, for instance, understands
the computer so well can never remember anything they ask him to
do.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that forgetfulness is usually a behavioral
problem. And that means it can be corrected. But first you have to
figure out what's triggering the absent-mindedness. The Simons'
family history revealed several factors that, taken together, were
contributing to Matthew's frustrating forgetfulness.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, Peggy and Mark reported that the problem really
started only when their son entered first grade. I told them I
doubted that ADD was a factor, since children with ADD often
display signs of irritability, lack of concentration and a high
degree of distractibility from infancy. (Psychological tests had
also ruled out any other learning problems.)
</P>
<P>
   What's more, first-graders are often forgetful. The curriculum
is more demanding and the school day is more structured than it is
in kindergarten. First-graders have to recall loads of information:
the names of their new teachers and friends, school routines, even
the location of the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew has a lot going on in his bead,'' I pointed out, ``and
it can be hard to keep it all straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgetfulness can be unwittingly exacerbated by high parental
expectations. Yes, kids at the age of 6 can do much more than they
used to. But they are, after all, still little. And although
parents want their children to take on increased responsibility,
many never take the time to teach them how to go about it.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Matthew to draw a picture of his family, another
critical piece of the puzzle fell into place. Matthew drew a house
with his parents, his sister and the dog inside -- and he was
outside. When I asked him to tell me about his picture, he said he
felt like he was on the outside a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy and Mark were initially surprised when they learned this,
but they soon conceded that, with a new business getting off the
ground and a third child on the way, perhaps they weren't spending
as much time with Matthew as they had in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing this, the Simons set aside 30 minutes each day for
one of them to spend alone with Matt, doing whatever he wanted.
Mark also acknowledged that raising his voice and insulting his son
weren't helpful, and he vowed to keep his temper in check.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew knew he was forgetful and was comfortable talking about
it. Together we discussed a plan: Since be was a computer nut, I
suggested that he type into the computer a list of Rules for
Remembering:
</P>
<P>
   1. Ask myself, What am I supposed to do right now?
</P>
<P>
   2. Figure out how to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pick a way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   4. Just do it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when his mother makes a request or he starts to do his
chores, Matt recites the list like a mantra. This helps him to
concentrate so he's less likely to forget important things.
</P>
<P>
   I also enlisted Matt's teacher to help him stay focused. She
wrote down each day's homework assignment on an index card, which
he gave to his mother as soon as he got home. Peggy now knows
exactly what Matt has to do each night and can gently prompt him.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, homework had been a haphazard affair, so the next
step was to set aside a specific time for Matt to study. The Simons
chose 7 p.m. as the starting time. I suggested they allow Matt to
choose where he wanted to work and that either Peggy or Mark stay
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Within two months, not only did Matt seem much happier but his
track record for remembering had improved greatly. ``He is so much
more responsible now, we get less upset with the occasional memory
lapse,'' says Peggy. ``After all, he's only 6!''

 Color slides and black and white photos of Billy Crudup and Woody
Harrelson in ``The Hi-Lo Country.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    You could say British director Stephen Frears has a way with
women. He took an unknown American stage actress, Annette Bening,
and turned her into a tough little sex cookie in the sizzling movie
``The Grifters'' (1990), garnering her an Academy Award nomination
and the attention of Warren Beatty. Anjelica Huston in the same
film has never been better.
 &HT;    Before that he picked Michelle Pfeiffer out of her sex-symbol
straight jacket, handed her a ``real'' role as the victim of an
amorous count's seductive designs in ``Dangerous Liaisons'' (1988)
and suddenly she wasn't just a pretty face.
 &HT;    And now in his first Western ``The Hi-Lo Country'' he's given
the treatment to not one but two actresses who have never looked
more gorgeous or been more real on screen.
 &HT;    Patricia Arquette plays Mona, wife to one man and object of
desire to two more: best friends and fellow roustabouts Pete Calder
(played by newcomer Billy Crudup) and Big Boy Matson (Woody
Harrelson). Mona is trouble but so seductive that the men risk
their deep friendship and their lives to grab her for themselves.
 &HT;    Arquette is right up there in Frears' book with Bening, Huston
and Pfeiffer. ``She's working class, she's right, she's wonderful,
'' says Frears. ``I saw her in 'True Romance' (1993) and I think
she's quite extraordinary.''
 &HT;    The other actress given the Frears treatment is Spain's leading
star Penelope Cruz. She plays Josepha O' Neil, Pete's
long-suffering girlfriend. Under his direction, a great beauty
becomes an absolute life force.
 &HT;    But while the women in ``Hi-Lo Country'' are the instigators of
the action, this time Frears is telling a story about men--real
men--and the difficult land they are attempting to tame.
 &HT;    ``Woody plays John Wayne here,'' says Frears laughing, ``When I
told him that he said, 'But I'm more flawed than John Wayne.' So I
said, 'That's what this is all about. It's John Wayne with
flaws.'''
 &HT;    For Harrelson's bosom buddy, Frears selected Billy Crudup, seen
in ``Without Limits'' (1998) and still largely an unknown. Under
Frears' direction he comes across like a veteran.
 &HT;    For a Cambridge educated Englishman, making a film in a genre
American audiences know as well as they know their mothers, it was
essential he find actors who looked capable of wrangling horses and
cattle and whose faces reflected a life in the sun in an
unforgiving landscape.
 &HT;    ``When I grew up actors had lines in their faces,'' he explains.
``I looked for actors that looked lived in, who looked as though
they had some experience of life. Billy did. He didn't look like
all those young actors out of Los Angeles. What's on their face is
their life experience.''
 &HT;    As for Harrelson, with whom other directors have had their
run-ins, Frears says, ``He's absolutely wonderful. His Big Boy's a
big lug--crude and rude. He's playing a passionate man, a heroic
American who defends what he believes in. And here I'm talking
about both Woody the person and the character.''
 &HT;    The place is the Santa Fe desert heart of the American West. The
time is immediately following World War II and in the town of Hi-Lo
the two best friends are reunited after their sojourn at war. All
is well until Pete discovers that Mona, a woman he has loved, is
having a hot affair with Big Boy and his own passions are
reawakened.
 &HT;    But the real love affair in the movie is between Big Boy and
Pete. ``In a sense,'' says Frears, who directed ``My Beautiful
Launderette'' (1985) which dealt explicitly with homosexuality,
``when a man loves a man, it must by definition be homosexual. But
making it explicit here would have been to make a different film.
This isn't homosexual, but it's about a man loving a man and it's
from a time when those things weren't laughed at.''
 &HT;    An Englishman's taking on the Western genre is a risk, but risk
has been a part of Frears' career from the beginning. It was a risk
to allow himself to be seduced to come to the Hollywood big time
from England where he had made a slew of small risky films like
``Prick Up Your Ears'' (1987) and ``Sammy and Rosie Get Laid''
(1987). It was a risk to go head to head with a director of the
caliber of Milos Foreman who was making ``Valmont'' on the same
subject as Frears' ``Dangerous Liaisons'' at exactly the same time.
 &HT;    Frears' version came out first and blew Forman's away.
 &HT;    ``I was just a bloke off the street,'' says Frears modestly, ``I
had nothing to lose. Christopher Hampton's script was wonderful and
I knew Milos could never have such a good script.''
 &HT;    When the conversation returns to his success with women he
points first to one of his failures: ``Mary Reilly'' (1996) with
Julia Roberts.
 &HT;    ``I think she was wonderful--very, very good in the film. I've
thought how stupid we were to be so undemanding of her. She would
have done anything for us. She would have gone to the moon if we
had asked. But it just didn't work and the problem was right back
there in the writing. We should have stopped it much earlier.''
 &HT;    And when it comes to discussing his triumphs, here too he is
reluctant to take any credit. When Bening's name comes up he beams,
``I'm very proud of her. It makes me laugh that I was there for
this great performance.''
 &HT;    As for Huston, he says, ``I wish I could take the credit for
bringing her out. She had for many years been in the shadow of Jack
(Nicholson). But she'd already won an Oscar for 'Prizzi's Honor'
(1985). The truth is you are just standing there at the moment. I
guess you create conditions, then they suddenly let rip and you
have it in the bottle.''

BOXER WARNS THAT AN UGLY SENATE TRIAL WILL LEAD TO STALEMATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton's Senate impeachment trial was
about to begin Thursday, Sen. Barbara Boxer warned that if it
``gets ugly and vicious and out-of-control like it did in the
House, it will cast a pall,'' ensuring that little is accomplished
in this Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think history is going to view this kindly,'' Boxer
told reporters at a breakfast meeting minutes before the start of
the first impeachment trial of a president in 131 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be called a partisan impeachment, a lame-duck
impeachment, a vicious impeachment, an impeachment done by people
who hated the president,'' she predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer, a staunch Clinton supporter whose daughter Nicole is
married to Hillary Rodham Clinton's younger brother Tony, said she
was disappointed that Senate Republicans apparently have rejected a
bipartisan proposal that would have settled Clinton's fate quickly
without a full trial.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said Republican calls for trial testimony from witnesses,
including former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, Clinton
confidant Vernon E. Jordan Jr. and several White House aides, could
prolong the proceeding indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican managers who are acting as prosecutors in the
trial are calling for five to 18 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said that if witnesses are called, ``no telling how long
it (the trial) will last.'' Comments from one witness could lead to
endless requests for additional witnesses, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the managers of wanting to turn the trial ``into a
circus,'' Boxer said not much legislative work will get done.
``We'll all try to do our work, but this is very difficult. This is
about throwing out a president, overturning an election.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer repeated her own position in favor of a resolution
censuring Clinton that expresses the sense of the Senate ``that
what he did was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Senate's confusion about how to proceed with the
trial ``shows that the conservative right is in control.'' But she
predicted ``some kind of backlash against the Republicans. ``I
think the (voters) are going to remember this.''

 `PJ's': A LITTLE WARMTH FROM EDDIE MURPHY  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Eddie Murphy's film career has taught us anything, it's that
he's hit and miss _ with an emphasis on huge hits and wincing
misses.
</P>
<P>
   So there was quite a bit of interest in Murphy coming back to
television, this time as the mastermind behind ``The PJ's,'' the
first-ever black animated show on Fox. Part of that interest stems
from Fox's unrelenting promotion of the show and the fact that the
``foamation'' technique by Will Vinton Studios (California Raisins)
is eye-catching.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PJ's'' (preview 8:30 p.m. Sunday, then airing Tuesdays at
8:30 p.m.) is the first of three new midseason animated shows from
Fox, the network that can barely do anything with real humans these
days but can't miss with animation.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to remember that when Fox launched ``King of the
Hill,'' the reviews were generally good but almost no one expected
the show to grow in such a wonderful fashion, emerging as a
breakout hit and offering the kind of subtle nuances you'd find in
a heartfelt drama, not an animated sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is that this first episode of ``The PJ's'' is good,
not great. It's a show you want to be funny _ perhaps funnier than
it is _ but also one that rewards your support with hints that it
will indeed round into form.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pilot episode is, like Murphy's career, hit and
miss, you never want to check out what else is on and that's a
success in these short-attention-span days of multi-channel
programming.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, underneath all the one-liners, ``The PJ's'' has a
real warmth, the same kind of honesty and sense of compassion that
elevates ``King of the Hill'' above a simple animated family
sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   (Now Murphy should hope that Fox doesn't switch nights like it
did with ``King of the Hill,'' losing nearly half its audience.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The PJ's'' follows the life of Thurgood Stubbs (voice of
Murphy), the superintendent of the Hilton-Jacobs housing project.
He's gruff but lovable and he sees himself as a heroic figure,
keeping the dilapidated building functioning and its disparate
array of tenants happy (and in line). They view him, in turn, as an
idiot.
</P>
<P>
   His sweet wife, Muriel (Loretta Devine), is channeling Oprah in
a serious way. Muriel and Thurgood have no kids but are surrogate
parents to Calvin (Crystal Scales), a 10-year-old who wants to be a
super when he grows up.
</P>
<P>
   Other characters include Juicy (Michele Morgan), Calvin's Fat
Albert-esque friend; Mrs. Avery (Ja'net DuBois), the 73-year-old
feisty neighbor; Haiti Lady (Cheryl Francis Harrington) who puts a
voodoo hex on just about everything; Sanchez (Pepe Serna),
Thurgood's pal who uses a voice box; Bebe (Jenifer Lewis), Muriel's
sister, Jimmy (Michael Paul Chan), Bebe's Korean husband, and a
revolving list of others who come and go in the projects.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of quick hits about Whitney Houston, Eartha Kitt
and 40-ounce beers along the way, not to mention rapid-fire
references to a variety of black culture hot buttons.
</P>
<P>
   The title originally came from a reference to Punch and Judy _
the working title being ``The PJs Project'' _ but was changed to
``PJ's'' as a reference to ``the projects.'' Murphy and company
want to give the rest of America a funny look inside such a place
and, along the way, flesh out the stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   He's got high goals and, ultimately, they're not that different
from the Southern parody in ``King of the Hill.'' The producers
understand that creating a sympathetic character that any audience
can relate to makes it easier to poke fun at surrounding players.
</P>
<P>
   And if ``The PJ's'' can grow into the nuanced gem that ``King of
the Hill'' has become _ and the pilot certainly gives that
impression _ Fox may have yet another hit on its hands.

 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In early January, John Travolta climbed into one his four jets
and flew himself to Palm Springs, Calif., for the night. The star
of such diverse movies as ``Grease'' (1978) and ``Face Off'' (1997)
picked up the career achievement award at the Palm Springs
International Film Festival.
 &HT;    Next morning, he was back in the cockpit speeding home to his
actress-wife Kelly Preston and their son Jett.
 &HT;    Travolta is a real action man these days--on and off the screen,
flying high in jets and in the very top of the top reaches of
Hollywood.
 &HT;    This year Travolta has two chances to go home with the best
actor Oscar which has eluded him in two previous nominations. In
the past 12 months audiences have seen Travolta in what are
arguably his best roles ever: a Clintonesque presidential candidate
in Mike Nichols' savage political satire ``Primary Colors,'' and an
elegant shark of a civil lawyer in ``A Civil Action.''
 &HT;    Based on Jonathan Harr's dynamite best seller, ``Civil Action''
is the true story of a tenacious personal injury lawyer who battles
corporate America over the pollution of ground water in Woburn,
Mass., and its terrible effect on neighboring families.
 &HT;    Many insiders felt Travolta couldn't handle the role of Jan
Schlichtmann, an odious bad guy; not for the first time, Travolta
proved them wrong. He says he's proud of both the roles. (He can
also be seen in Terrence Malick's World War II film ``The Thin Red
Line''--a cameo he played as a favor to Malick whose latest film is
his first in 21 years.)
 &HT;    Meeting the Los Angeles press in a cashmere turtleneck, sports
coat and slacks, Travolta, 45, looked comfortable with himself. ``I
relished the opportunity to play a man who is cynical, arrogant,
detached and abrasive because these are not the roles usually
offered to me,'' he said.
 &HT;    ``I also like the fact that this movie doesn't preach--and that
it's a movie like 'Philadelphia' (Tom Hanks' Oscar-winning picture
about a lawyer dying of AIDS.) This was a movie about character
rather than issues. I saw Jan as a bit of a blackmailer who had
been corrupted by power so he's actually a villain at the beginning
and is transformed through the experience of working with these
families.''
 &HT;    Travolta got the part in ``Primary Colors,'' opposite Emma
Thompson, after Tom Hanks dropped out. Though the movie was not a
box office success, most critics agreed Travolta did an uncanny
job. ``I was very proud of 'Primary Colors,' he said. ``I think it
will hold up as one of the best political films ever made and
certainly the most informative about how politics really work.''
 &HT;    Although Travolta has been a frequent visitor to the White
House--on one famous occasion he danced with Princess Diana--he
claims he personally never got any feedback from the current
occupant of the Oval Office.
 &HT;    ``I did hear from Roger Clinton (the president's brother) that
the president really did like it and thought I had a heartfelt
feeling about the interpretation. And that was nice.''
 &HT;    So from the first family on down Travolta is the flavor of the
year. Even today, he said, he marvels at the twists and turns his
career has taken.
 &HT;    First there was ``Saturday Night Fever'' (1977) and then there
came a time--a long time--when he couldn't get arrested in
Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``I was afraid and confused in those days,'' he said, ``but I
wouldn't admit it. I tried to put on a brave face when really I was
having ulcers because of the pressure to make films that didn't
exploit my image.''
 &HT;    He started taking risks, pushing himself beyond the conventional
Travolta type roles and before long, after comeback films like
``Pulp Fiction'' (1994), ``Get Shorty'' (1995) and ``Broken Arrow''
(1996), he was pulling in the same kind of salary as Tom Cruise,
Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson. Today his price is $20 million a film.
 &HT;    He has magnificent homes in California, the East Coast and
Florida, and with his four jets and his love of flying, it's a
breeze to get from one to the other. He's also very proud of the
fact that in l998 he completed a training course that certifies him
to fly a Boeing 707.
 &HT;    And he keeps up a phenomenal work schedule. He's just finished
``The General's Daughter'' opposite Madeleine Stowe and this year
he will star opposite his actress wife in ``Shipping News,'' a
picture he calls ``a funny eccentric piece.''
 &HT;    The pair married in 1991. ``I think we have good chemistry on
film,'' he said.
 &HT;    Travolta's confidence in himself and the absolute inevitability
of his success comes, he is the first to tell you, from his
membership since 1975 in the controversial Church of Scientology.
 &HT;    In tribute to his religion, in l999 he also plans to star in the
science fiction film ``Battlefield Earth,'' written by the church's
founder, the late L. Ron Hubbard.
 &HT;    ``In the '70s it helped me avoid drugs and drinking--that's
where everybody in those days was leaning. Without them, '' he said
``I wouldn't have lived any longer than John Belushi. It gave me
the strength to survive all those years when no one wanted to work
with me, and it helped me overcome a lot of anguish in my personal
life.
 &HT;    ``I've always been so proud of what it's done for me and my
family. I learned the organizational skills that are the basis of
L. Ron Hubbard's beliefs. It's necessary to make sure that Kelly
and Jett and I can have an ordered proper happy life in a home
where both parents are out working almost nonstop.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: 'Parental consent' laws, 'parental rights' laws can't be
reconciled
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big government poses some sticky dilemmas. When government gets
into micromanaging daily lives, the judgment calls can be
excruciating.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't dissuade disciples of big-government conservatism.
Into personal lives they would point government's snout, and shout,
``Charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, they oppose government involvement in the board room.
But in the bedroom, it's OK. And in the physician's room, you bet.
And in purging the Internet of offensive matter, Godspeed _ except
when Congress makes an emergency appropriation of smut about the
president. Overall, in telling people what they can't read, see,
hear and feel, these people are consistent: Bring on government.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, in the 1990s conservatism has come to mean big
government.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the quest to ban abortion. Those who would
abolish Roe vs. Wade are a minority in this country. In an even
smaller minority are those who would ban abortion in all instances.
</P>
<P>
   Others who oppose Roe can think of contingencies _ rape, incest,
medical necessity _ in which they'd allow abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, sticky dilemmas: Was the applicant raped, or just
date-seduced? Do you have forensic evidence, Miss? And would you
like to prove your rape charge in court?
</P>
<P>
   Put rape aside. Try ascertaining for certain that an abortion is
of medical necessity. Is one doctor's word enough? How about two?
Three? And anyway, the guiding slogan of the anti-abortion movement
would seem to be that physicians have no business interfering with
big government.
</P>
<P>
   Minor becomes mom
</P>
<P>
   Now we shift to another big-government agenda, so-called
parental consent/notification bills which await the Texas
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone would agree. A minor should talk to her parents when
seeking an abortion. But we know some of them won't. A few will
have good reasons. The big-government answer is to require
notifying the girls' parents, even when this might involve abusive
parents or an incestuous father.
</P>
<P>
   Under a bill by State Rep. Arlene Wohlgemuth, the state would
say to such a minor, ``All right. Tell it to a judge.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that states with these laws routinely have
pregnant girls going into states that don't. In Texas, their
options would also include Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It's often cited that a minor needs parental consent to have
one's ear's pierced but not to have an abortion. False analogy. The
former has to do with insurance liability, not ``parental rights.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fact is that abortion isn't the only medical assistance
available to a pregnant minor in Texas without her parent's
consent. She can get prenatal care, and good for that. And heaven
knows, she also can roll into an emergency room in labor without
involving Mom or Dad. Or should we pass a law?
</P>
<P>
   Contradictory
</P>
<P>
   The philosophy behind parental consent laws directly contradicts
that of the ``parental rights'' laws promoted by the very same
conservatives. They want to prevent the government from interfering
in the upbringing of children, even to the potential shielding of
parents who put children at risk through abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   What they're saying in support of ``parental rights'' is that
supplying the plumbing and the DNA gives a person inviolable
rights.
</P>
<P>
   By that exact standard, then, and under their own anti-abortion
terms of conveying 14th Amendment protections to a fertilized egg
and requiring the mother to abide by them, they would seem impelled
to oppose parental consent laws. For if ``parental rights'' are
inviolate, the girl with the fertilized egg in the womb, the
parent, should call the shots.
</P>
<P>
   So, just who is the parent in parental consent? Big government
should know, but its disciples on the right obviously don't.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Cost of Clinton's muddled Iraq policy to soar
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Jan. 10, 1999.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something's rotten.
</P>
<P>
   It's got to do with our Iraq policy and the fact that President
Clinton suddenly is looking to increase the budget of the Defense
Department. This has never been a Clinton priority but is being
justified by him now, in part, as a result of the hundreds of
millions he has spent bombing Iraq (while avoiding its dictator and
the supplies of chemical weapons Clinton contends threaten our
civilization.)
</P>
<P>
   The president is seeking $100 billion for defense during the
next six years, the largest increase since Ronald Reagan's defense
initiatives sent our budget into a swirling sea of red. Unlike
Reagan, Clinton has no Soviet bogeyman, so Saddam Hussein becomes a
substitute. (China would seem the more obvious bogeyman but no one
wants to mess with a robust China.)
</P>
<P>
   Public Affairs TV programs, as well as the nation's newspapers,
are awash in speculation about Clinton's Iraq policy. While the
White House states that its goal is the elimination of Hussein's
rule, every indication is that the bombing has only strengthened
it.
</P>
<P>
   And the cost to the United States has become obscene.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News and World Report magazine estimates in its Jan. 11
issue that the four days of bombing cost $450 million, that each
cruise missile fired by B-52s cost $1.8 million and that each
anti-radar missile fired by aircraft cost $320,000. Subsequent to
that, the recent days of no-fly zone activity/combat have resulted
in more air-to-air missiles being fired _ and nothing hit!
</P>
<P>
   This is distressing, not only financially but militarily and
politically.
</P>
<P>
   From the think tanks come all sorts of speculation. Among them
is that of William Hartung, senior fellow of the World Policy
Institute. Hartung, who recently authored a paper critical of the
military-industrial complex, claims to have information that a
Monica-weakened Clinton bowed last fall to the Pentagon's demands
for more funding.
</P>
<P>
   In his paper, released Nov. 23, Hartung contends ``the arms
industry has launched a concerted lobbying campaign aimed at
increasing military spending and arms exports. These initiatives
are driven by profit and pork barrel politics, not by the objective
assessment of how best to defend the United States in a post-cold
war period.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying that the U.S. must remain in a strong
military position, but it can be questioned whether we know how to
do it. Cruise missiles flying into mud huts in Afghanistan or
laser-guided bombs plopping onto presidential palaces in Iraq
obviously have not made much of a dent in what drives our fears.
</P>
<P>
   What is our enemy? Is it terrorism? Is it Saddam Hussein's
so-called weapons of mass destruction? Likely, it is both. And just
as likely, we have not affected either. The bombing in Iraq was
intended to destroy the vehicles capable of carrying Hussein's
toxic warfare to targets elsewhere. But, and for good reason, the
chemicals were not an objective. They have to be captured, not
bombed. When and how do we take them?
</P>
<P>
   Hussein's weapons of mass destruction remain intact. So does
Hussein, probably now more popular with his people than ever; a
living, breathing, ranting martyr.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. has expended vast sums of money in
frittering away missiles and bombs, in moving military equipment
hither and yon. Coupled with a Defense Department budget that has
largely stood still for one and one half decades, there allegedly
appears a need to replace _ and increase _ that which was expended
with no apparent positive results.
</P>
<P>
   This troubled, weakened president sits in no catbird seat. He's
looking for all the friends he can get. Among them is the military
and the defense contractors. A Clinton who never met Monica, or
Paula, or etc., would have been in a position to stand taller
against the military-industrial complex or any other strong
lobbying group not in his realm of political interest.

IN CALIFORNIA THE NEW BOSS SOUNDS A LOT LIKE OLD BOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY and ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The California Legislature has gotten its
first taste of what the state's self-proclaimed centrist governor
wants _ and it sounded a lot like Republican ex-Gov. Pete Wilson,
give or take a few new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   In his first State of the State address to a joint session of
the Legislature, Gov. Gray Davis constructed a layer cake of Wilson
themes _ from school accountability, to continued funding for more
police on the street, to rewarding excellent teachers with $10,000
bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who spoke for about 40 minutes Wednesday night, proposed
a $100 million retooling of a Wilson-era mentoring program to allow
teachers to judge the performance of other teachers. He also
threatened to have the state shut down or take over local schools
that failed to make the grade, a hard-line tone that sounded a lot
like Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly members, senators and Davis supporters applauded 48
times during the speech. But Democrats rose to their feet only
toward the end, when Davis proclaimed his support for restoring the
requirement to pay overtime for more than eight hours in any
workday, a distinctly Democratic and union-supported idea.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans sat stone-faced, Davis said he would instruct his
appointees to the Industrial Welfare Commission to reverse a
Wilson-backed rule requiring employees to work a 40-hour week
before qualifying for overtime, instead of eight hours in a single
day.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats gave Davis a more tepid response when he hit on themes
Wilson had pushed during his last few years in office: school
accountability and the idea of rewarding excellent teachers and
punishing substandard schools.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first speech by a Democratic governor in nearly two
decades, and it managed to appeal to the GOP in form.
</P>
<P>
   ``The room was populated with Democratic members of the
Legislature, so you would expect a tepid response,'' said state
Sen. Jim Brulte, a Republican from Rancho Cucamonga, a suburb of
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gov. Davis seriously believes he wants merit and
accountability in the public school system,'' Brulte said,
``Republicans in the Legislature are his natural allies. He will
have to bring Democrats kicking and screaming, because they have
opposed school accountability since I entered the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   During his eight years as governor, Wilson mastered the art of
form _ deftly taking many Democratic ideas, such as class-size
reduction, and turning them into his own. He consistently hammered
on the need for school accountability as well, an idea that plays
well with voters, and installed a new statewide assessment test for
many of the state's 5.6 million public school students.
</P>
<P>
   Building on Wilson's education themes, Davis must provide more
substance to back tough-sounding statements that schools are
failing and low standards and bad teachers who need to be fired are
part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Davis proposed Wednesday a ``rigorous high school graduation
exam, second to none in America.'' California does not have a
uniform test required before graduation from high school. He
proposed a teacher-peer review system that would allow experienced
teachers to judge their colleagues, and make recommendations on
whether their contracts were renewed or they got fired.
</P>
<P>
   And Davis sounded even tougher in his proposal to select at
random 200 of the state's worst-performing schools and give them
more money and two years to turn things around. The Wilson
administration had a similar idea, but it focused on the bottom of
the heap, rather than a random selection of mediocre schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those that have shown no significant improvement will face
serious consequences,'' Davis said. ``These will include dismissal
of the principal or reassignment of teachers or creation of a
charter school by the parents or reorganization of the school, even
closure of the school or district.''
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated his call for a special session of the Legislature
on Jan. 19 to address education.
</P>
<P>
   Though Davis and his aides titled the speech ``The Era of Higher
Expectations,'' the new governor began his address sounding like
his onetime boss, former Gov. Jerry Brown, who told Californians to
lower their expectations about what government could do during
tough economic times. Davis warned that the Asian financial crisis
already had led to job losses in aerospace and electronics
industries, and could slow economic growth in the state.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested he would have little discretionary money to spend,
given a projected $2 billion to $3 billion budget deficit in
addition to measures such as the 25-percent car tax reduction
approved by Wilson and the Legislature, which will cost the state
$1 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put it succinctly, this year we face budget pressures that
require discretion, financial caution and crystal-clear
priorities,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The new governor took a decidedly un-Wilsonian tone when he
proposed a ``four-year moratorium on wedge-issue politics.'' State
Sen. Tim Leslie, a Republican from Roseville, said Republicans and
Democrats alike wanted a spirit of civility in Sacramento, but
added that ``if getting along means agreeing on all issues, it's
not going to happen because there are philosophical differences
among us.''

THIS MARRIAGE NEEDS A TIME-OUT 
 FOR USE FRI., JAN. 15, OR ANYTIME THEREAFTER.
</HEADLINE>
  By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: I have been married for 29 years. About 18 months ago
my husband lost his job and started a new business with a single
40-year-old woman he knew through work.
</P>
<P>
   When they started having an affair I was devastated. We
separated and didn't see each other for a month. He then said he
wanted us to try to reconcile and work on our marriage. I was
agreeable, but he says he can't leave his business partner because
he's invested too much money in the company, can't sell it because
it's too new and can't bear to disappoint his investors.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's sorry for what he did and wishes the affair had
never happened. We were in counseling, but after five weeks I told
him it wasn't going anywhere because his behavior stays the same.
What am I supposed to do? _ H.S. in New Jersey (via e-mail)
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: As heartbroken as I know you are, it sounds like your
husband really is remorseful.
</P>
<P>
   Now seems the time for the two of you to take a time-out and go
to a neutral corner. He has to prove to himself as well as to you
that he can be faithful, whether or not he continues to work with
this women for the short term.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him to give you a proposal that: 1) reasserts his commitment
to you; 2) presents a business plan that severs his relationship
with this woman within the next six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Give him a chance to woo you again. In the meantime, you need to
work on making sure that your marriage is vibrant and healthy. As
nasty as the whole situation is, if the two of you can sort it out
you both may benefit.
</P>
<P>
   What you're both fighting for here is time--time to reinvest in
your marriage, time for him to get over this relationship, to
stabilize his work relationship and to do a little penance as well.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I was listening to your show before going to sleep,
and had to get up to write that you blew it with the caller who had
a cancer-riddled dog that was going to be euthanised soon. He
wondered how to handle it with his son, and you counseled: ``Ask
him if he wants a puppy for Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   First, Christmas is the wrong time to get a puppy. Always. And
second, you suggest getting a replacement dog without any grief
time, as if a dog was something hardly more important than a broken
appliance.
</P>
<P>
   You also said that the death of a love-object, such as a pet, is
a dress rehearsal for the death of a human being. Love for a
companion animal is NOT a dress rehearsal for real love.
</P>
<P>
   People experience tremendous love for animals, love based on
deep emotional connection, not some imaginary let's-pretend love.
</P>
<P>
   I feel you need to rethink some of your assumptions regarding
animals. I must add that I am a veterinarian _ R.W. (via e-mail)
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: As you're a vet, I'm sure you listen more closely to
your clients, human and otherwise, than you did that night to my
radio program. What I said is that the dad had to be honest with
his son. The only way we learn to deal with death is to deal with
death. I have not, nor would I ever use the phrase ``dress
rehearsal'' in the context of any life.
</P>
<P>
   For most of us the issue isn't dying but the loss of choice and
the alienation of dying alone. I suggested the parent give his son,
who was 10, some understanding of why his dad was making the
decision and seeing if the vet would allow the son to hold the dog
if he wished to be there at the time.
</P>
<P>
   When I talked with this person, Christmas was still months away,
which is why I suggested that they could talk about getting another
pet as the holiday drew nearer, and thus associate it with
something joyous, rather than a replacement at a time of loss.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My daughter, a senior in high school, has not pushed
herself since middle school when she was told she was ``gifted.''
Now she gets B's and C's, with a grade point average falling to a
2.8. How do you motivate children to perform up to their potential?
Is it too late when a senior in high school?
</P>
<P>
   We have another daughter, a sophomore, who tries very hard and
achieves good grades. The older one constantly compares herself to
her and complains that I'm trying to control her life. I want to
help her with her college decisions, not control her! _ Missoula,
Mont.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Mom, it sounds like it's time to back off. We motivate
someone by helping them decide why it's in their best interest to
do what we want them to do. But the emphasis here is what you want
your daughter to do, not what she wants for herself.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds like a kid who very likely tests well, who has a lot
of extracurricular activities. It may be that she has decided that
she does not want to be a ``brain'' to high-school boys--certainly
a common affliction, though wrongheaded.
</P>
<P>
   Love both of your children for who they are. We need to give our
kids roots and wings and the hard part is never the roots. It may
be that she's one of those kids who doesn't find out what she wants
to do until long after high school. So back off--anything you
decide for your daughter is not as important as the goals she sets
and achieves for herself, even if you feel the bar is too low.
</P>
<P>
   Both of you will be happier with your decisions.
</P>

STUDY: NATION'S EDUCATION SYSTEM IS A MIXED BAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A massive study of the nation's public schools
paints a grim picture of student performance and concludes that
most states, including California, have yet to establish policies
that identify and turn around failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   The 206-page study, released Thursday by Education Week,
compares education in 50 states, giving California decidedly mixed
grades: a B in efforts to raise teacher quality and an F in
adequacy of school funding. California has no policy to let parents
know how one school compares with another, or a strategy to turn
around failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   In student achievement, the picture is especially bleak. In
reading and math, California's fourth-graders earned among the
nation's worst scores on the National Assessment of Educational
Progress, given every two years to a sampling of students.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, just 11 percent of fourth-graders and 17 percent of
eighth-graders were deemed proficient in math. Twenty percent of
eighth-graders scored proficient in science. Only Louisiana and
Mississippi students fared worse in both subjects.
</P>
<P>
   California has the ignominious distinction of being ranked dead
last in school financing. One of the wealthiest states in the
country, with 5.6 million students, California spends $4,789 per
student, adjusted for regional cost differences, according to the
report. The national average is $5,906. Other populous states such
as New York and Texas spend $7,635 and $5,889, respectively, per
pupil.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, glimmers of hope that California's enormous
system of public education, which educates more students than any
other state, is in the midst of substantive reform. In addition to
garnering a B for efforts to improve teacher quality, the state
earned a B-minus for its new academic standards and statewide exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a sea change already, with new standards, a new
test, smaller classes,'' said Superintendent of Public Instruction
Delaine Eastin. ``I want to see us continue on that path _ only
faster. And more than anything now, we need an accountability
bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Education Week, a weekly newspaper that focuses exclusively on
public education, based its report on private and public data
covering everything from school financing to test scores. The
report is also based on a national survey of teachers, parents and
employers and the newspaper's archives dating to 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The report, called ``Quality Counts,'' was underwritten by the
Pew Charitable Trusts. It is the third annual report published by
the newspaper. The 1998 report, while comparing states, looked at
the unique plight of urban schools, which teach 11 million
children, or one out of every four students.
</P>
<P>
   This year's report targets how states are holding schools
accountable for providing a solid education to students, whether by
linking teacher evaluations to student performance or offering
bonuses to schools that show significant improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accountability for student performance is one of the two or
three _ if not the most _ prominent issues in policy at the state
and local levels right now,'' said Richard Elmore, a professor at
Harvard University's graduate school of education.
</P>
<P>
   States looking to make schools more accountable face several
challenges. Students must be tested, the information must be
comprehensively and clearly reported and there must be a plan to
deal with schools that are faltering.
</P>
<P>
   The report finds that the majority of states have put in place
testing policies. But they are having a hard time deciding how to
reward successful schools and punish failing ones.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every state has taken steps toward accountability: 48
states will test students in 1999, and 36 will issue ``report
cards'' on individual schools that include test results, the report
found.
</P>
<P>
   California requires districts to publish performance reports on
each school. In addition, the state publishes its own performance
reports on every high school and makes them available on the state
Department of Education's Web site. The Legislature has passed a
bill encouraging districts to make them available on their own Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   This week, in his first days as California governor, Gray Davis
announced a series of proposals aimed at rewarding schools that
show significant gains and providing intensive aid to schools that
persistently fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when taxpayers are demanding results from schools
and the public's patience with persistently failing schools is
wearing thin, states must develop effective strategies to reward
schools that succeed and target assistance to those that don't,''
said Virginia Edwards, the editor of the report and of Education
Week.
</P>
<P>
   The report found key disparities in how states are measuring
school performance and reporting results to the community: Fewer
than half the states _ 19 _ publicly rate the performance of all
schools or at least identify low-performing ones.
</P>
<P>
   Only 16 states have the power to close, take over or overhaul
chronically failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   Only 19 require students to pass state tests to graduate from
high school; only six have laws that will link student promotion to
test scores in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Only two have attempted to tie the evaluation of individual
teachers to how well students perform.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, while the public supports strident measures to increase
accountability, teachers do not, according to the national survey
conducted for Education Week by the New York-based research group
Public Agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that 77 percent of employers and 70 percent of
parents think it's a good idea to have principals work under
contracts that could be terminated if their schools failed to reach
specific goals. Sixty-four percent of teachers said that's a bad
idea.

 &HT;    Pleasing core constituents will bring down the party
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton scandal has run a wild course, lurching from the
absurd to the unbelievable. But through it all, one constant has
remained.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, when the Lewinsky mess first broke, polls
showed that 30 percent of Americans supported President Clinton's
impeachment and removal from office. The latest polls still peg
that number right at 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So think of that 30 percent as a large rock sitting on a beach,
solid and immovable. Whatever else happens in American politics,
the rock remains. Speaking in general terms, it represents what
might be called the Christian Coalition and Rush Limbaugh vote, the
core of those voters who for various reasons are profoundly
disturbed by the direction of American culture and see Clinton as
the hated symbol of that culture. They believe that Clinton's
removal would be an important victory in their war to reverse the
nation's course.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Republican Party, of course, that hard-core 30
percent represents more like 70 percent of party members. The rock
dominates the GOP landscape. That's why, in Georgia and other
states, Republican candidates who do not appeal to that cultural
conservative vote have difficulty winning their party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In general elections, where Democrats and independents also
vote, the rock still sits there, but its relative importance
shrinks. Still, at low tide _ in low-turnout years without much
controversy to draw people to the polls _ it can loom large. Even
when others sit home, that 30 percent turns out, election after
election. As a result, they played a major role in the 1994
off-year elections, when Republicans gained control of both the
House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At high tide, however _ in those years when voter turnout is
strong across the board _ that rock is submerged, all but
unnoticeable. That explains why Bob Dole got only 41 percent of the
vote in 1996 and George Bush only 38 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   For Republican political strategists, the situation requires a
delicate balancing act. They always have to placate that 30 percent
_ they have to make the rock happy _ but they have to do so without
provoking the rest of the electorate to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, they manage the trick by feeding the hard core a few
symbolic votes that get noticed within the conservative movement
but otherwise don't draw much attention. The Republican tactic of
attaching anti-abortion riders to foreign-policy funding bills is
the classic example of that strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment, however, has thrown that strategy out the window.
The 30 percent is demanding Clinton's head, and the Republicans are
trying hard to give it to them. Trouble is, when you're trying to
kick a popular president out of office, the rest of the country is
going to notice.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, in other words, have trapped themselves. They
have no choice but to please the rock; but they know by doing so,
they all but guarantee a very high tide in 2000 that may wash them
out of power.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: WHERE THE CYBER-RUBBER HITS THE ROAD
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Jan. 10
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Perhaps sometime in the next century more people
will own personal computers than will own cars. But until that day
comes along, the same folks who brought us the PC revolution plan
to load their chips wherever drivers can reach them.
</P>
<P>
   Why else would Microsoft, the world's leading software firm,
serve as the official online sponsor of the annual North American
International Auto Show, being held this month in Detroit?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has placed four live-view video cameras in Cobo
Center, allowing callers on its CarPoint web site to watch on the
auto show's public days. With a click of a mouse button, a virtual
visitor can point the cams wherever he or she wishes and snap shots
of snazzy ``concept cars'' at up to 12 times zoomed resolution.
</P>
<P>
   With $15 billion in loose cash in the bank, Microsoft can well
afford to show auto buffs a good time on the Internet. But this is
strictly a business deal.
</P>
<P>
   In Bill Gates's perfect world, every driver would be able to
slide behind the wheel and scan both the e-mail and the dashboard
gauges. With a device known as AutoPC, soon to be sold in stores
around the country, that notion will no longer be just a dream.
</P>
<P>
   AutoPC's let folks on the move use voice-activated and
touch-sensitive commands to check their e-mail remotely, to
navigate through city streets, to receive real-time weather and
traffic updates, and to play casino games or their familiar CDs.
The units are marketed by Clarion, a car radio maker, and run on a
slim version of Microsoft's Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Since they employ the same kind of flash memory chips found in
digital cameras, people who travel in several cars can move their
rolling databases among the AutoPC's installed in each vehicle. The
devices also synchronize with handheld units powered by the
Microsoft system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials say an updated version of their car computer
software will ship in 2000. If the past is any guide, future
versions of the AutoPC will have more features and sport a larger
viewing screen. But are they safe?
</P>
<P>
   Critics fret that users will take their eyes off the road. But
Clarion notes that since AutoPC's are voice-activated, drivers
won't be unduly distracted. The company even argues that its
product may actually make driving safer since it offers directions
when you become lost.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, however, voice technology still isn't quite
there. While Auto PC's are likely to work well in controlled
settings, such as cars parked in quiet lots, they could turn buggy
when faced with high ambient noise levels on crowded freeways.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it would be nice to have some accessible software that
monitors all critical aspects of the car's engine. Or software
connected to sensors on the front and rear bumpers that lets
drivers automatically keep their distance from other cars or that
lets them know the remaining distance to any obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when most would-be drivers needed to pass the
kind of test now demanded of licensed auto mechanics. The time may
yet come when ``Digital Driving for Dummies'' will be a
best-seller.

APPLE RIDES RESURGENCE ON A WAVE OF GRAPE, LIME, AND OCEAN TEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   ``Delicious.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hardly a word used to describe a computer. But that's the
adjective Apple interim CEO Steve Jobs blurted out as he unwrapped
the five candy-colored iMacs during his flashy MacWorld Expo
keynote speech at the Moscone Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   The colors _ blueberry, grape, tangerine, lime and strawberry _
are the latest incarnations of the top-selling ocean teal iMac,
which debuted Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Betsky, curator of architecture, design and digital
products at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, said: ``We have
to recognize that design saved Apple. It was to Steve Jobs' credit
that he knew he had only one card left to play _ design _ and it
was an important card.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Apple, the Cupertino computer maker has shipped
800,000 of the futuristic iMacs, which look like something out of
the Jetsons home. Those sales figures make the iMac the country's
best-selling PC model.
</P>
<P>
   After years of playing it safe, the iMac's sales figures have
convinced the computer industry that now is the time to finally
break free from the beige, sheet-metal boxes that have squatted on
desktops for years.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac, said Paul Otellini, an executive vice president at
Intel, ``is a great wake up call for the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Otellini, the iMac has shown that as home computers
begin to become indistinguishable in price and performance, it will
be the outer skins that can make a difference in a customer's
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Otellini said unnamed major computer makers had recently shown
him some upcoming innovative designs that would change the desktop
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has already designed several prototypes of
metallic-colored pyramid shaped computers, with the hopes of
creating a consumer design movement in the home computer industry,
the better to spur sales of Intel microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of good-looking computers is long overdue, said
Hartmut Esslinger, CEO of Frog Design, a Sunnyvale-based design
firm that has done design for Apple, IBM, Compaq and other computer
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so horrible that this industry became so degraded by
conservatism with shortsighted, boring designs,'' said Esslinger, a
renowned industrial designer. ``This is a shame. This is a
scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Esslinger, whose company is designing the next generation of
Windows-based machines for Micron Technology Inc., Vadem Inc. and
Packard-Bell NEC, Inc., said that the ubiquitous beige computer box
was a design dictated by the technicians stuffing microchips and
hard drives into them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers are a relatively young product,'' said Esslinger.
``It's still a box with a TV set on top and a broken up typewriter
in front of it. Very boring. The technology has been driving the
product design.''
</P>
<P>
   Of eye-appealing, design-driven PCs, SFMOMA's Betsky said,
``Having an object like that is important like having a new kitchen
appliance or having a pet is important. It makes you feel as though
you can have an emotional relationship with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the color. While desktop computer makers have in
the past experimented with emerald, blue, black and other hues,
they've always reverted back to the same putty color.
</P>
<P>
   Esslinger said the color served an ergonomic purpose by keeping
contrasts down in an office environment. ``Too much contrast, it
damages the eye.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that beige was also a color of ``cowardice'' that
needed to be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at nature, it's not only gray, it's green, it's
flowers, it's blue skies, it's teal oceans,'' said Esslinger.
``People want color back into their artificial environment, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsky agreed. ``Color is back, thank God,'' he said. ``It's
back in cars, it's back in clothes. It's just as easy to use color
as not to use color.''
</P>
<P>
   But some are skeptical that computer sales will be driven by
looks. David Card, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, a New
York-based new media market research firm, says design hasn't
played a major role in home electronics, such as stereos and TVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colors and fancy designs never really took hold in consumer
electronics,'' said Card. ``People buy those based on features, not
looks. And I think that will continue to carry over into the home
computer market.''
</P>
<P>
   But Card said design could be a factor as computers started to
level off in pricing and performance.
</P>

   ``All else being equal,'' Card said, ``it could be the factor
that tips someone into making a decision.''

THE BEST ACCESSORIES FOR THE MAC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As they say in the fashion world, there are
three rules to looking hot: accessorize, accessorize and _ wait for
it _ accessorize.
</P>
<P>
   That's the mantra at this week's MacWorld Expo, where
accessories for the curvy teal green iMac dot the convention floor.
Making gadgets that match the iMac, however, will become a bit more
difficult after this week, when Apple Computer CEO
for-as-long-as-he-likes Steve Jobs unveiled the five additional
iMac candy colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we'll just have to go back and pour more colors,''
sighed Scott Signore, a spokesman for Agfa Corp., which thought it
would make a bigger splash with its now-outmoded teal colored
scanner. ``I wish Apple had given us all a little more warning.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, as they say. Here are a half dozen of the best iMac
accessories on the MacWorld floor. For those 800,000 who have an
original teal iMac, go for it. For you newer candy color iMac
buyers, you may have to wait until summer for that complete,
coordinated look.
</P>
<P>
   ISpeaker: These speakers can hold their own against the iMac's
cool factor. They come with 3D stereo enhancement that really does
give sound an amazing depth coming from such a small package.
They're powered by a 16-watt amplifier, so you can make a
statement. Front mounted controls help you turn them down quick.
Out now. $39.95. By Ariston Technologies. Info at 800-326-5294 or
www.ariston.com
</P>
<P>
   IDock: This is one of the more sophisticated iMac add-ons. The
iDock is a tray that fits under the iMac. On the back is an array
of ports that let you hook up older Mac peripherals (scanners,
printers, etc.) that don't use the iMac's newer USB connectors.
There's also a swivel mount in case you want to make your iMac
boogie (hey, I don't invent them, I report on them). Due in stores
by March. $199 list. From CompuCable. Info at (714) 557-5510 or
www.compucable.com
</P>
<P>
   USB iBall Pro: Ball. Get it? Anyways, this is an iMac-looking
trackball, for all those mouse haters out there. It sports a
see-through body and crystalline ball that looks like you could
read fortunes in it. The iBall also has a second programmable disk,
so you can save yourself a click or two on your computer journeys.
$79 list. Out now. From Macally. Info at (626) 338-8787 or
www.macally.com
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ICatch: One of the cheapest add-ons for any computer. This is a
small, translucent cowling that fits on the back end of the
circular iMac mouse, which give it a more standard, oblong shape.
Many have complained that the standard round iMac mouse can throw
off a user's orientation. This is a good, cheap fix. $9.99 list.
Out now. From Macsense. 800-642-8860 or www.macsensetech.com
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SnapScan 1212: There aren't many full-blown peripherals out
there yet for the iMac. IMac-compatible printers and scanners are
still being produced in the dreaded corporate beige. Now, the
SnapScan is your standard scanner with 36-bit color capabilities
and a USB connector. But the iMac version is in a dense, teal
green. It sort of looks like a giant piece of radioactive sod that
landed on your desk. But that's the price you pay for ifashion.
$129. From Agfa Corp. Due out in March. Info at 888-281-2302 or
www.agfahome.com.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VST iMac USB Floppy Drive: Steve Jobs wants you to abandon your
floppies, deeming them ``legacy'' (read: old) technology. But many
people happen to like using disks, especially when you're giving a
document to another computer user, or trying to back up smaller
files. This floppy drive is small, so as not to disrupt your
desktop aesthetic, and easy to hide if Jobs decides to check up on
you. Reads standard 1.44 MB floppies. Uses the iMac's USB port.
$99. From VST Technologies, Inc. Out now. Info at (978) 635-8200 or
www.vsttech.com.

A JURY OF THE PRESIDENT'S PEERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sworn in by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the
nation's 100 senators have been transformed into a jury _ and a
most unusual one at that.
</P>
<P>
   These sharp-tongued politicans are unaccustomed to the juror's
ways of silence or objectivity; many may have already made up their
minds in the case. And even as they wield the power to overturn the
1996 presidential election _ and toss Bill Clinton into political
exile _ they are as unlike the generality of the American
electorate as they resemble the man on trial.
</P>
<P>
   This, then, is the jury of President Clinton's peers: Nine out
of 10 are male; 97 are white. Many have postgraduate degrees, 57
percent in law. While only eight have families with a single child,
all but five have experienced married life, and 88 consider
themselves Christians. Twenty-eight are baby boomers, born between
1946 and 1964.
</P>
<P>
   ``Demographically, they're entirely different from a normal jury
_ they are far more educated, far more knowledgeable, with legal
backgrounds of the kind that would get a normal person eliminated
from a normal jury,'' said Brandeis University professor Jeffrey B.
Abramson, who wrote a book about the jury system in 1994. ``They're
politicians, like him. And because they're politicians like him,
they're driven by politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to take the good with the bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the most relevant statistic will be the number of
votes _ 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats will decide on the question
of conviction or some alternative. But as the Senate moves ahead
with a trial _ with legal specialists grappling over momentous
legal questions under the watch of the entire world, and with the
knowledge that this case is likely to set a precedent for decades
to come _ the way these 100 people resemble and depart from the
rest of the nation is coming into focus.
</P>
<P>
   It may be the Senate's racial homogeneity that drives Clinton,
who has been buoyed by support of minorities, furthest from his
peers. The only minorities in this jury pool are Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, a Colorado Republican, who switched parties in the middle
of Clinton's first term, and the two Democratic senators from
Hawaii, Daniel K. Akaka and Daniel K. Inouye.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a throwback to an earlier era when you had all-white
juries,'' said Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American
Enterprise Institute in Washington. ``This is just as Congress has
been for quite a long time _ not representative on a lot of grounds
of the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is not a traditional jury in any traditional sense,''
he continued. ``A jury is supposed to be people who have no biases.
The judge can drop jurors because they exhibit a particular bias.
This is a jury made up of 100 biased people.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at the numbers shows just how much the senators differ
from the general public. More than half, for example, have more
than $2 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Senate is far ahead of the general population in
education and bank accounts, there are varying degrees of both
among senators. Neither Clinton nor the general population is as
wealthy as Massachusetts Senator John F. Kerry (believed to be
worth more than $500 million) or as credentialed as New York
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who has a bachelor of science, a
bachelor of arts, a master's, and a doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   In religion, the Senate is predominantly Christian. There are 11
Jewish senators, and Campbell, a Native American, does not specify
religion in his public profile.
</P>
<P>
   But among Christians there are other dividing lines. One-quarter
of the Senate is Roman Catholic; 12 senators are Episcopalian, and
12 are Methodist. Nine members belong to the Baptist Church, as
does the president.
</P>
<P>
   Family demographics are particularly striking along party lines.
While roughly the same number of senators on both sides call
themselves parents, the Republican members generally have more
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Democrats, only Akaka of Hawaii and Harry Reid of Nevada
have more than four children. Meanwhile, 11 Republican senators
have five children or more, and two of the 11, Mike DeWine of Ohio
and Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, each have eight children.
Senator Jim Bunning, a newly elected Republican from Kentucky, tops
the list with nine.
</P>
<P>
   Having a single child appears to be a slightly more Democratic
trait: Six Democratic members have, like the Clintons, a
single-child home. Just two Republican members can say the same.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever traits Clinton may coincidentally share with the newly
sworn jury, the design of the trial will ultimately have far more
effect on its outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules of impeachment, the senators run the show. They
decide what direction the trial will take and can stop it at any
time; if a 51-person majority dislikes a decision made by Chief
Justice Rehnquist, it can instantly overrule it.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, they are deeply familiar with both the defense and
the prosecution _ and, thanks to nearly a year of intense publicity
surrounding the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal, almost every detail of
the case. As a result, ``we're bound to be disappointed if we
expect them to behave like normal jurors,'' Abramson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end,'' he said, ``they are the judge.''

WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM THEIR FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Creativity is where you find it, and in this
town you find it almost everywhere. Even among the beggars.
</P>
<P>
   The streets around the Moscone Center are lined with them, far
more than you'd look for in so prosperous a town. But I almost look
forward to reading their signs, unusually witty appeals for spare
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Residentially challenged,'' reads one. ``Broke as the Ten
Commandments,'' says another. Still, I keep looking for one urging
the passersby to ``think different.'' You go with what works, and
this slogan certainly seems to be working for Apple Computer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, this company was nearly as hard-up as
this town's street people. The remarkable success of the stylish
iMac has changed that. Apple employees at the MacWorld trade show
exude a quiet confidence which, for the first time in years,
carries with it not a trace of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing inevitable about Apple's recovery. In the
1980s, Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc. was the world's number one
modem brand, and company founder Dennis Hayes was nearly as
respected as Bill Gates or Steve Jobs. But on Monday, Hayes closed
down its US operations for good, while clinging to a semblance of
life in overseas markets. Just a couple of years ago, Hayes came to
Boston and told me all about his plans for turning the company
around. It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Apple interim CEO Steve Jobs made the same journey to Boston
about 18 months ago to announce his plans to save the company. Jobs
has done a whole lot better, partly because he's found ways to tap
reservoirs of creativity far from Apple HQ in Cupertino.
</P>
<P>
   Walk the show floors here and you see dozens of companies
rolling out new software and hardware accessories for the Mac.
Some, like game maker Id Software Inc., are converts to the Mac
platform; others, like financial software maker Intuit Inc.,
recently planned to abandon the Mac, only to have a timely change
of heart. Agfa Corp. of Wilmington, Mass., makes costly high-end
scanners for printers and graphic artists. But spurred by the
popularity of the iMac, Agfa rolled out a $129 scanner done up in a
matching shade of green plastic. One of the Agfa guys tells me they
can't make them fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   The most fervent, passionate defender of the Mac I've heard this
week is a fellow named Ben Waldman, a Harvard computer science grad
who works for, of all people, Bill Gates. Two years ago, when
people like me were writing Apple off, Microsoft Corp. set up a
business unit to concentrate solely on original software for the
Mac. Eighteen months ago, MacWorld attendees in Boston were
disgusted by news of a formal Apple-Microsoft alliance. Two days
ago, Waldman showed off the fruits of Microsoft's efforts, and won
cheers from the MacWorld crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the hotel, Waldman is no less assertive. ``I think with
so many companies you see Macintosh customers treated as
second-class citizens,'' he said. ``Our vision at Microsoft is very
different.'' As with the widely praised version of Office for the
Mac released last year, all Microsoft Mac programs are now designed
from the ground up for the Mac, rather than afterthoughts cobbled
together out of Windows code. The result: creative, original
Microsoft programs for the Mac, instead of boring, me-too titles.
</P>
<P>
   Waldman proved his point by showing off a new Web browser for
the Mac with features unavailable to Windows users, and a new
Microsoft Web site devoted to all things Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Apple recently testified against Microsoft in
that federal antitrust trial in Washington, it's tempting to mock
the assertions of mutual affection. But then, Waldman says that Mac
software is a small but profitable part of Microsoft's revenue
stream.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has every reason to keep the Mac folks happy. Waldman
also notes that Microsoft's commitment to the Mac sent a message to
the entire computer industry that it was safe to develop original
software and accessories for Apple machines. They've gotten the
word. The Mac market is still a small one and likely to remain so.
But it was big enough for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   That's made a lot of difference _ to software developers, who
are once again applying their creative genius to the Mac platform,
and to Apple, newly departed from Skid Row with a lot of help from
its friends.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the growing number of consumers who did much of their
holiday shopping on line, Patricia B. Seybold did more than just
shop. She also rated a variety of e-commerce Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The author of ``Customers.com: How to Create a Profitable
Business Strategy for the Internet and Beyond,'' a top-selling
business book, Seybold handed out gold stars and low marks to
on-line retailers as she shopped for toys, clothing, books, music,
and perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Her subjective rating of retail Web sites offers some
perspective on recent estimates that said on-line shopping not only
tripled from a year ago but also exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In Seybold's opinion, toy retailer eToys.com was the best site
for consumers looking for holiday gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised,'' she said, before referring to a popular
on-line bookstore. ``I expected Amazon.com to be the best.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seybold's survey, Amazon placed second. Eddie Bauer and
Lands' End also got high marks. One item that couldn't be bought on
line to her satisfaction: a drum set for a 12-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written about e-commerce and how
mainstream &UR;  &LR; consumers have finally become comfortable with it as a
convenient, time-saving alternative to shopping at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   But amid all the recent hype, it can be easy to forget that even
the most optimistic of forecasts put on-line holiday spending at $5
billion, or about 3 percent of overall sales.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that $5 billion figure is too high, most early
indications are that on-line holiday sales were well above the $2.3
billion total that Jupiter Communications, a New York research
firm, had predicted in early November.
</P>
<P>
   On-line shopping's sudden surge also came with a downside: Big
upward spikes in December business simply overwhelmed some
e-commerce retailers. Consumers who had a bad experience at a Web
site in 1998 are unlikely to revisit that site this year.
</P>
<P>
   In her selective and subjective appraisal of Web sites, Seybold
focused less on the big picture and more on customer experience and
the nuts and bolts of retailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What customers are saying is, `I don't have a lot of time, and
there has to be a guarantee that the things I order will arrive
when they're supposed to,' '' said Seybold, who also heads the
Patricia Seybold Group, a Boston consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   And how well did a retailer handle the special requirements of a
consumer buying a gift for someone else? Did a retailer offer gift
wrapping? What was the Web site's return policy? Were prices
competitive with those at the mall? Was a site easy to use? And,
most important, did gifts arrive on time?
</P>
<P>
   Those were some of the criteria Seybold used to separate good
Web site experiences from bad, and there were many subpar
experiences. In fact, of the 34 sites she visited, she bought gifts
at only 18.
</P>
<P>
   At TravelSmith.com, for example, Seybold finally had to resort
to the apparel retailer's 800 telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to place an order at the Web site was ``too much work,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But TravelSmith did do something Seybold liked very much. Click
on the picture of an item, and a visitor knows right away if the
item is out of stock in a particular size and color, she said.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case at Eddie Bauer or Lands' End, where
customers didn't learn something was out of stock until they had
gone through the entire ordering process, Seybold said.
</P>
<P>
   L.L. Bean ``didn't have a good search engine,'' Seybold said.
And Music Boulevard, at musicblvd.com, had a different drawback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music Boulevard was great in every respect but they didn't
offer gift wrapping,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Amazon.com, a shopper couldn't order many books at once and
easily have them sent to different addresses, Seybold said.
</P>
<P>
   And when gifts arrived from Amazon.com, it was hard to tell who
the gift-giver was because no note card was attached to the box,
only a packing slip inside, Seybold said.
</P>
<P>
   The iQVC Shop at QVC.com committed the gravest error of all: It
sent gifts to Seybold's credit-card billing address instead of to
her aunt and uncle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't get their presents,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Seybold had high praise for Eddie Bauer. Apparel items purchased
on line could be returned to any of the chain's many retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   That's a service that merchants who sell only on line can't
offer, and it's one reason the Boston Consulting Group and
Shop.org, an association of electronic retailers, predict that the
successful retailers of the future are ones that operate in several
formats, including brick-and-mortar stores, Web sites, and
mail-order catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   For old-fashioned consumers who still shop the malls and the
department stores, ``take 20 percent off'' tags seemed to be
everywhere this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Not so on the Internet, where discounts seem less common,
Seybold said. Exceptions may be books and toys, perhaps because
eToys and Amazon.com were competing fiercely with traditional
chains. So those looking for the lowest prices on apparel shouldn't
forsake the mall just yet.
</P>
<P>
   In Seybold's view, eToys was the one on-line retailer that did
nearly everything well, from offering competitive prices to running
a good Web site to ensuring that gifts were shipped on time and to
the right address.
</P>
<P>
   ``EToys had a completely blowout season,'' said Seybold, adding:
``Everybody I know was delighted with their experience at eToys.''
</P>
<P>
   The world of e-commerce is in such flux that it's hard to pick
out winners and losers. Will the top 10 Web sites continue to
account for 50 percent of all on-line retail sales? _ as the Boston
Consulting Group noted in a November report with Shop. &QC; 
org.
</P>
<P>
   But as eToys suggests, when an e-commerce retailer gets it all
right, success can follow. Who knows? Someday soon some Internet
retailer might even turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   And while it's easy to highlight the downside, Seybold found
that many e-commerce retailers were doing some things right this
year. As they continue to experiment through trial and error,
e-commerce retailers could soon improve to the point where they at
last can deliver on some of the Internet's hype.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, e-commerce retailers may have learned a lot this holiday
season, and many time-starved consumers became hooked on buying
things from a Web site, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By next Christmas, I think things will really be good,''
Seybold said.

LESS IS MORE OF AN EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In writing on any subject these days, one should avoid the old
trap of sounding . . . well, old. Modern readers want to look
forward rather than backward; the dreams of young men are
infinitely more interesting than the reminiscences of old ones.
</P>
<P>
   With that disclaimer I will report only that after receiving
three inquiries concerning what I meant by the term ``spaghetti
pot'' skiing in a recent column, I immerse in some shameless
reminiscence.
</P>
<P>
   It is of deep nights and a wind so heavy it made the farmhouse
groan and the moonlight boil out across the pasture. Of cast iron
warmth so intense it could drug you into a satisfied, muscle-spent
sort of stupor. It is of minimalism, and of a somehow more heroic
dimension of skiing, real or imagined, in an age past.
</P>
<P>
   I was heartened to see a few years ago that ski bumming is still
alive and well, to some extent. In fact, the ski bum in my family
was making good on a promise to himself that, after college, he
would head for the Rockies. And sure enough, the October after
graduation, skis packed on the old Toyota, he hit the road,
unwittingly playing out a role created by kids of his grandfather's
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Like ski bums of all ages, life for him became a struggle
between the necessities of filling one's belly occasionally and
getting as many runs in the back bowls as he could. Night jobs were
best, and of course night jobs involving food made both life and
skiing possible.
</P>
<P>
   Rent? Prohibitive of course, so you live in such crowded
conditions as would make a college dorm palatial. And for survival,
the serf class of ski bums always develops an underground economy,
trading deli sandwiches for ski tuning, or some such. The only
thing that really mattered was that sweet season ski pass, and
somehow the water turned to wine and there were enough loaves to go
around. Everyone survived the winter and got in about 150 days of
skiing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ski bumming has to end for most because of unwritten
laws against it going on too long. These young men and a few women
broke up in the spring to look for ``real'' jobs. Lean and deeply
tanned, never would they look or feel as healthy again, nor have
heads so clear nor as sure a sense of freedom. They will toast
those days at each other's weddings.
</P>
<P>
   It is about simplicity. The simpler skiing is the more intense
the experience. Snowboarders understand this well, which is why
they so ferociously defend their identity.
</P>
<P>
   That is what ``spaghetti pot'' skiing means to me. Simplicity.
Minimalism. A time when economic constraints made it necessary to
rent a big farmhouse where three families would meet on Friday
night to start splitting and laying in several days' wood for the
stove.
</P>
<P>
   Slopeside, or ``ski in, ski out'' living, was largely unheard of
in those days. The closest thing was back in college days, finding
a girl whose family owned an A-frame on the access road a couple of
miles from the lifts. On weekends when her family was not there,
that little A-frame would be so full of kids we must have been in
violation of several local ordinances, not to mention the fact that
most of us were blowing off Friday and Monday classes.
</P>
<P>
   Years later in our farmhouse, adults and children had very
specific divisions of labor. The men did the Viking things,
naturally, like split wood and get the fire roaring and inspect the
fuses on the water heater.
</P>
<P>
   Women pretty much cooked _ except when it was some Viking
preparation such as great shanks of beef to be roasted on the
outdoor grill _ and kids did the cleaning up and whatever shoveling
had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   A big pot of spaghetti went a long way and became the favorite
dinner all around. The wine adults drank came from a huge gallon
jug with a nondescript label; lunch was sandwiches brown-bagged to
the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the per-person cost of skiing in those days was a
fraction of today's condo-restaurant routine. Few skiers seem to
look for the minimalist approach anymore, with the notable
exception the ski clubs that still go to North Conway, Cannon, and
other historic areas.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose there was a TV in our farmhouse, but the Saturday
night I recall most vividly began when one of the Vikings said to
the lounging kids, ``As old and decrepit as we are, I bet the
grownups could beat you kids across the lake on cross-country skis
by 50 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a flurry of action as the offended youngsters leapt to
answer the call, and as sore as we all might have been from skiing
that day, we were dressed again and on cross-country skis.
</P>
<P>
   The night wind howled, blowing little twisters of powder off the
drifts and creating a crust over the lake that made the skiing
fast. We proved again that night that if you ski hard enough no
amount of windchill can touch you, and so we worked our way across
the lake and back through the woods along the shore.
</P>
<P>
   After two decades some dispute remains over who actually reached
the opposite shore first. What we all well remember is, after a
couple of hours cross-country skiing that frozen night, how
wonderfully warm the stove felt as people stomped their feet on the
wood floor to thaw them out, and how the hot chocolate and cider
never tasted better, before or since.

MEDIA WEREN'T LOCKED IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Specifics about this season's NBA broadcasts were impossible to
determine in the wake of Wednesday's last-minute deal that settled
the six-month lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Television executives, starved for the ratings generated by the
NBA, said they were excited about the settlement but were unable to
provide details about schedules and lost advertising income. The
deal still isn't official, nor are the details ironed out.
</P>
<P>
   The media did their part to come up with the information. They
scrambled with the best, especially CNN. The news giant balanced
NBA coverage with Iraq, J. Dennis Hastert's election as Speaker of
the House, and the Clinton impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the NBA settlement hit the cable airwaves first on
CNN/SI at 10:36 a.m., second on CNN 10 minutes later, and third on
ESPN at 11:07. Thirty minutes is not much of a difference in the
scheme of things, but the race was on for details.
</P>
<P>
   CNN/SI's Mark Morgan, citing sources, said only that a deal had
been struck.
</P>
<P>
   The first word on CNN came in the form of a crawl during a
30-minute retrospective on the impeachment of President Andrew
Johnson. The crawl announcing the NBA's season-saving deal cited
``CNN/SI sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, CNN showed Gary Tuchman live in New York. ``If
the NBA is your bag, then you will have it by February,'' the CNN
reporter said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuchman came on live again at 11:15 with some background
information.
</P>
<P>
   Several players, some of whom were roused from sleep, told him
they didn't have any idea about a settlement. As far as they knew,
Tuchman reported, they were going to vote on the owners' final
offer.
</P>
<P>
   When one player learned of the deal, he reportedly said, ``That
would be beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The players still don't know there's a deal,'' Tuchman
concluded. ``Or at least the rank-and-file members here in New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN had unique problems. The self-proclaimed sports leader
repeats the same loop of highlights and commentary throughout the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   When news breaks, the network is unable to immediately update
the loop to reflect its own, and others', live reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Quick-thinking producers were at least able to update the
oft-repeated interview of NBA commissioner David Stern by Dan
Patrick Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hearing Stern hint about a possible last-minute deal,
viewers now heard Strern saying union executive director Billy
Hunter was ``not being manipulated . . . but under enormous
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Before ESPN had the story, Stern had been shown smiling as he
discussed how long the talks had lasted _ ``seems like 100 years''
_ and how owners would listen to his advice based on his 15 years
as commissioner and 30 years as a negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting stuff, but the emerging details coming out of New
York had the adrenaline flowing.
</P>
<P>
   The story got more flesh at 11:45.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's Dave Aldridge reported that the deal was reached by
Hunter and Stern at 6 a.m. after hours of secret negotiating. The
season, Aldridge said, would begin in early February and encompass
52 games. Aldridge further reported that the deal still needed both
sides' official approval but would likely be endorsed by the owners
at their Board of Governors meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   CNN had other breaking news to cover, switching from its NBA
story to the United Nations for the latest on the Iraq situation.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, everyone had the bare bones of the NBA story. All the
Boston stations led their newscasts with studio reports and live
shots from New York. Channel 7 had reporter Gary Gillis on the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Jackie MacMullan, the former Boston Globe
sportswriter now working for Sports Illustrated and CNN/SI,
reported that ``at least a dozen players walked out on Stern'' when
he addressed them. ``They wouldn't even listen to what David had to
say,'' MacMullan reported. ``So it's going to take some time to
mend some fences here. The big losers, as usual, are the fans and
the ticket-paying customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Celtics TV analyst Tom Heinsohn said the deal couldn't have come
at a worse time for the team. The existing schedule called for the
Celtics to play at the FleetCenter Feb. 4, then hit the road for
the rest of the month. All sorts of events, such as an ice show and
Bruins games, had been scheduled for the building during February.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the logistics, Heinsohn expressed excitement about
the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, some cooler heads prevailed,'' he said. ``I thought
they were going to blow it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinsohn said there is a silver lining in the lockout. With only
a 52-game schedule, he believes more conference games will be
played, reemphasizing the old rivalries that dominated the league
before expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be a blessing in disguise,'' Heinsohn said. ``It
seems like the league will have more of a conference-type schedule.
Expansion had made the old standing rivalries lack substance. The
teams barely played each other. But this might help the game get
going again.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that is a big if.
</P>
<P>
   As for the impact of the lockout on television, NBC and TNT paid
the NBA $2.8 billion to air games, and while the league must repay
both networks for missed games, both will lose out on potential
advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The unknown problem is how much the lockout will affect
viewership. The only comparison is with the major league baseball
strike in 1994. Ratings since have dropped by as many as 5 million
viewers. Even one of the most prized television properties took a
hit. Last year's World Series between the New York Yankees and San
Diego Padres earned the lowest ratings ever.
</P>
<P>
   Viewership on both NBC and TNT has decreased without the NBA
games. Replacement movies failed to generate similar numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs will be the true test of the viewers' acceptance.
The postseason schedule is uncertain, but plans are to have the NBA
Finals conclude by July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing summer vacations steal viewers from television, Stern
has told reporters he doesn't want the season to drag too far into
July.
</P>
<P>
   He's right.
</P>
<P>
   No sense further infuriating basketball fans.

A BOLD NEW LOOK FOR HISTORIC COLORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARGO MILLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Move over, Colonial Williamsburg. You've got competition in the
historic paint biz from SPNEA, the Society for the Preservation of
New England Antiquities. The new venture, a partnership with
California Products Corp., is called Historic Colors of America and
it's an eye-opener.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us brought up thinking historical paint was mostly
milky and muted, this is yet another lesson in the surprise of the
antique. SPNEA's stunning paint chart has 149 color chips. Who, you
wonder, first fell for the brilliant but edgy color called
Goldenrod, a gold with a green past? Who brought the punchy Biloxi
blue north? The 14 reds are autumn at its most gaudy and the eight
beiges are as theatrical as greasepaint. Any one of the 48 stately
earth-tone neutrals would banish the blahs. Their very intensity
makes them versatile. They are as much at home in the world of
commerce and industry as warming your ``stick'' Victorian.
</P>
<P>
   With the Historic Colors of America project, SPNEA's
enterprising director Jane Nylander has moved the 89-year-old
organization further into the enriching field of American
decorative arts. Previous directors had followed in the footsteps
of the founding antiquarians. To hear Abbott Lowell Cummings
exclaim about ``the oldest-known sugar cube still in its paper
wrapper'' or the two centuries' worth of bills and receipts
preserved by the Codman family was to know an SPNEA founded for the
pack rats of history.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, antiquarian interests are still catered to. But Jane
Nylander's is a voice for the magpies of interior decoration. She
was trained (in fact, was the first woman student) at Winterthur,
Henry Francis Du Pont's great Delaware estate and museum school for
the American decorative arts. A fellow student was her future
husband Richard Nylander, now SPNEA's chief curator and director of
collections. With her particular expertise in American textiles and
his in wallpapers and paint, SPNEA was halfway home when the
decision was made to merchandise more of the organization's
collections.
</P>
<P>
   To date, SPNEA has licensed 22 artisanal workshops or
manufacturers to reproduce items from the SPNEA collections , says
licensing manager Carol Bruce (see accompanying story). The
royalities go to support education programs and restoration
projects.
</P>
<P>
   The latest addition is paint, the Historic Colors of America
line produced by California Products, of Cambridge, Mass.
Independent paint dealers carry the line, and each of the 149
colors, whether for interior or exterior, is available as water- or
oil-based paint. ``Paint completes the picture of SPNEA we started
with reproducing furniture and fabric and accessories,'' says
Bruce. ``It's the backdrop you paint when you paint your walls or
moldings or floors.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that there was anything wrong with the Colonial Williamsburg
palette. If somewhat limited in range, those sage greens and slate
blues and brick reds had conjured up a Colonial America since the
1920s when John D. Rockefeller Jr. undertook the restoration of
Virginia's 18th-century capital. What could not have been predicted
at the time was the impact on home decor of the merchandising of
Colonial Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   It began modestly in 1936, the year the first buildings opened
to the public. As tourists watched, local artisans made pewter,
silver, and wrought iron for sale. The Colonial Revival movement
had given America some taste for the past. Now here was the stuff
itself, the accuracy of reproduction vouched for by scholars and
the price (somewhat) less than for real antiques.
</P>
<P>
   The Colonial Williamsburg ``look'' took off. It would become a
huge business, yielding $70 million in 1997 from mail order and 26
retail shops. Fifty 50 manufacturers are licenced to reproduce
4,000 items, including furniture, fabrics, and wallpaper. The paint
line was bagged by Martin Senour, a division of Sherwin-Williams.
This month, the number of colors, for exteriors as well as
interiors, will expand from 46 to 96, according to Sophie Hart, the
Colonial Williamsburg publicist for product licencing. ``They'll be
available to the trade (decorators) in January and retail in
March,'' says Hart.
</P>
<P>
   The income from SPNEA's reproductions, says Bruce, will never
approach Colonial Williamsburg's. ``When we are up and running, and
it could take 10 years for the project to mature, we will be
thrilled with half a million a year in royalties.'' Nor does SPNEA
plan to shop for catalog items at trade shows specializing in gifts
and accessories. ``We are purists right now. Everything we sell
comes from one of our properties and will have a brochure or
hang-tag telling its history.'' Not so with the catalogs for most
museum stores. Descriptive phrases like ``inspired by'' or
``reminiscent of'' tip the buyer to a trade show origin. Finding
merchandise for their catalogs ``is like feeding a monster,'' Bruce
says catalog managers tell her.
</P>
<P>
   SPNEA's association with California Products began in earnest
about three years ago when Jane Nylander posed the question of
licensing historic colors. That California had donated paint to
SPNEA over the years made it a likely place to start. Another plus
was its Cambridge base. It had fetched up here in 1926, when its
California parent company thought New England was ripe for stucco
houses and set up a factory to make the water-based acrylic paints
used on stucco. ``Stucco never quite made it in New England,'' says
Paula Berberian, California Products' director of advertising and
merchandising here.
</P>
<P>
   A natural for work in color, Berberian grown up in a family very
into interior design. ``We were always asking what color to paint
the house.'' She says she loves reds, admits to a yellow kitchen
and color-washed walls.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Nylander's initial approach to California,
Berberian says she had no idea what SPNEA was. ``Jane asked me to
come on a tour with her. I saw the Lyman Estate in Waltham. We
drove up to Gloucester to Beauport, which was fabulous. At
Cogwell's Grant my eyes just lit up. How these people lived with
color!'' As a member of the merchandising committee of the
Denver-based Color Guild International, Berberian is one of the
``color police'' who tell us what colors we'll be wearing or
painting our rooms. ``Purple is very in,'' she says. ``People think
it's comforting.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to convene a research group comprising
Berberian for her marketing smarts and SPNEA's Jane and Richard
Nylander, Carol Bruce, and Brian Pfeiffer, then vice president for
preservation and conservation planning, for their knowledge of
historic colors and where to find them. ``The sources were many and
varied,'' says Richard Nylander. Some came from paint research.
Others from painted objects, like Shaker boxes and folk carvings,
or from wallpapers.'' About the word ``historic,'' he cautions,
``it's not the be-all and end-all for all periods but how we can
use history.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 20th century, almost everyone agreed the old paint
archeology practiced by SPNEA's early antiquarians was long past
its due date. The oldtimers had scraped down through layers of
paint to what they believed was the oldest, and that color became
the look of the past. Maybe so, most likely not, for that oldest
layer of paint had had many a summer in the sun and had been
altered by a number of chemical reactions. So it was understandable
but misleading to suppose that the faded and muddy meant the old
and authentic.
</P>
<P>
   SPNEA's first lesson to the contrary came in 1970 with the
restoration of the Harrison Gray Otis House, the Federalist's
elegant mansion in Boston's West End (and now SPNEA's
headquarters). The vibrant yellows, greens, and blues that Otis
knew could finally shout their story.
</P>
<P>
   Berberian's other task was to make sure the range of colors
would interest the professional design world. ``Historically there
have two palettes,'' she says. ``One is for contract, or commercial
work, for public spaces like stores and offices. The other is the
consumer, what you have at home. A lot of the color you see in
contract work is very trendy.'' But with more of us living in the
workplace, the two palettes have tended to merge.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing 149 colors, Berberbian says California and SPNEA
play to the new ``intermixture of lifestyles.'' Each color family
is deliberately deep, from the pale but intense to the rich and
spicy. The response from decorators and designers has been ``very
positive,'' says Berberian, and ``consumers are going wild.'' Sales
also look promising in Canada and Ireland. How you use SPNEA's
historic colors is up to you. If you want to repaint your old house
an authentic color, there's a handy chart listing those suitable
for the Colonial period to 1780, the Federal period to 1830, Greek
Revival from 1825 to 1855, the Victorian era from 1840 to 1900, and
Colonial Revival, 1900 to 1940. But SPNEA, with its collection of
34 historic properties and more than 100,000 objects in five New
England states, certainly won't mind your using its paints to juice
up your modern high-rise condo.
</P>
<P>
   Berberian sees a big future for the new earth-tone neutrals, the
doves and parsnips and woolly thymes, toffee, britches, bean pot
and Quincy granite, that should wean the timid away from pales and
pastels. Each neutral is strong enough to stand up to white, has an
affinity for accent colors, and is warm. ``All very livable
colors,'' says Berberian.

HOW CLINTON WILL TRY TO BEAT THE RAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody's got a censure plan. Former Presidents Gerald Ford
and Jimmy Carter have a censure plan. Former Senate majority leader
Bob Dole has a censure plan. Senators Slade Gorton and Joe
Lieberman have a censure plan. All of these plans are
well-intentioned. None of them will work.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is there will be no censure of President Clinton. There
will be no compromise ``solution.'' There will be no deal. There
will be a vote up or down _ most likely after an evidentiary trial
_ to acquit or convict. The roll will be called and Bill Clinton
will either be removed from office or let off scot-free.
</P>
<P>
   Two forces have converged to all but guarantee this outcome.
First, Republican constituencies insist that such a vote be taken.
They want a trial and they want a vote of conscience after all the
evidence is heard.
</P>
<P>
   They will not be denied. If Trent Lott tries to short-circuit
the constitutional process, he won't remain the Senate majority
leader for very much longer. Republicans will toss him overboard
and get someone else to do his job.
</P>
<P>
   Second, President Clinton wants no part of a censure deal. He
has stated repeatedly, through various mouthpieces, that he will
``never admit'' that he lied under oath. No less than Vice
President Al Gore was trotted out over the Christmas holiday to
reiterate the president's position on this issue. Without an
admission of perjury, all of the various censure deals listed above
collapse in a heap.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that President Clinton is waging an all-out
campaign for acquittal. He will accept nothing less. He believes
that he is innocent. He believes that he did not commit perjury. He
believes that he did not obstruct justice. He believes that he is
the victim of a vast right-wing conspiracy and a hateful media. He
thinks history should read that a recklessly partisan House of
Representatives impeached him but that the US Senate exonerated
him. He is angling for exoneration.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's political operatives don't understand this.
They talk on background and off the record about the president
``accepting'' some sort of ``censure deal.'' They talk on the
record about a ``fair'' and ``expeditious'' process. The truth is
that Clinton will never accept anything that in any way legitimizes
his impeachment by the House.
</P>
<P>
   What the White House really wants is dismissal on summary
judgment. Toward this end, they have made it clear to Lott and
Daschle that an evidentiary trial will be a very long, very
protracted fight. A series of White House leaks over the last
couple of weeks has served to reinforce this message.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the White House let it be known that it is prepared to
contest the constitutionality of a lame-duck House of
Representatives referring articles of impeachment to a newly
sworn-in Senate. Tuesday, New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis
amplified the case for dismissal on constitutional grounds, citing
Yale Law School professor Bruce Ackerman's paper on the subject.
The issues involved are not insubstantial. Resolving them could
take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   This week the White House (via The Washington Post) let it be
known that in the event of an evidentiary trial, its legal team
would contest every fact, every clause, every comma in the two
articles of impeachment referred by the House. This could cause the
impeachment trial to last for months and possibly the entire
calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of these thrusts is to stampede Republican senators
into a quick vote on whether the charges ``rise to the level of
impeachment.'' The threat is that if Republicans go forward as the
Constitution requires, the trial will drag on. Republicans read the
same opinion polls as everyone else. They fear that their approval
ratings will fall further if they do not bring the impeachment
trial to a speedy resolution.
</P>
<P>
   If the White House can stampede enough senators to vote for a
quick dismissal of the two articles of impeachment (which requires
only 51 votes), they then will hold all the cards. Whatever
leverage the Senate once had in the wording of a ``censure''
resolution will no longer exist. Once the charges are dismissed,
the White House doesn't have to admit anything or apologize to
anybody. They've beaten the rap.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate Republican leadership allows this to happen, they
will be dismissed for dereliction of duty by the Senate GOP caucus.
GOP constituencies will make sure of that. So the only road out of
this mess Clinton has made for us all is a trial, with witnesses,
cross-examination, and all of the evidence on the record. It won't
be pretty _ nothing about Clinton's veracity ever is _ but it's the
right thing to do.

A NEW PROGNOSTIC TOOL FOR HEART ATTACK RISK  
 A CAESAREAN EFFORT DRAWS SPECIALISTS' IRE  
 OTHER DEVELOPMENTS, HIV TO BETA-CAROTENE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   &UR; A new prognostic tool for heart attack risk
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ultrasound measurements of neck artery thickness are
considerably better than blood pressure or cholesterol readings in
predicting heart attacks or strokes among older people according to
a study being reported this week.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel H. O'Leary, the New England Medical Center's chief
radiologist, and several colleagues followed 4,476 men and women
older than 65 with no symptoms of cardiovascular disease. They were
participating in a federally funded health study. They used
ultrasound to measure how much fat and cholesterol had built up on
the walls of key zones of their carotid arteries, then followed
people for an average of more than six years.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, artery wall thickness proved to be a strong predictor
of who would have a stroke or heart attack. The 20 percent of
people with the thickest vein walls had on average about 5.5 times
as many strokes or heart attacks as the bottom 20 percent of study
participants, O'Leary's team wrote for the current New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Among people with high blood pressure and cholesterol, those
with the thickest artery walls had about twice the risk of heart
attack or stroke as those with the thinnest. ``Carotid ultrasound
is a stronger predictor than anything else'' of risk, O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claude Lenfant, head of the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute, said in a statement that the method ``has great
potential'' for preventing the first- and third-ranking of death in
the United States. About 650,000 people a year die of heart attack
or stroke here.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary cautioned that doctors and technicians will first need
much training in how to interpret the ultrasound images. ``We
shouldn't encourage everyone to run to the doctor to have their
wall thickness tested,'' O'Leary said, but expects it will in time
become ``a very powerful test'' that can be done easily and fairly
cheaply in doctor's offices.

 &UR; A Caesarean effort draws specialists' ire
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four prominent Boston obstetricians are blasting federal efforts
to sharply cut the rate of Caesarean deliveries within the next two
years, calling it an ``authoritarian'' effort that could threaten
women's and babies' health.
</P>
<P>
   Caesarean delivery rates have soared in the last three decades,
from 5 percent in 1970 to a peak of 25 percent in 1988, and now at
about 21 percent. The US Department of Health and Human Services
has set a goal of reducing the rate to 15 percent by 2000, both to
save money and reduce health risks for women who could safely
deliver vaginally.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``there is no evidence to support this target'' of 15
percent, said the chiefs of obstetrics at Massachusetts General
Hospital, Dr. Fredric Frigoletto, and at Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center, Benjamin Sachs. Co-authors of the paper are Dr.
Mary Ames Castro of Mass. General and and Dr. Cindy Kobelin of Beth
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reducing the rate of Caesarean section delivery may lead to
higher costs and more complications for mothers and their babies,''
the four doctors write. Alternatives to C-section, such as vacuum
and forceps extraction of infants, have considerable risks, and
attempting vaginal delivery after having had a C-section leads to
uterine rupture in about 1 of 100 women.

 &UR; Other developments, HIV to beta-carotene

<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other medical news: California AIDS researchers report in the
current Nature Medicine that HIV not only kills off T-cells in the
body's immune system, but apparently also stops the body's ability
to make more. . . . A urine-sample test called NMP22 produced by a
Newton, Mass. company, Matrotech, may be used as an inexpensive,
pain-free way to screen undiagnosed people for bladder cancer,
according to a Journal of Urology study . . . Coating the inside as
well as the outside of central-vein catheters with two special
drugs, as is now commonly done, may reduce bloodstream infections
that strike 150,000 US patients annually, Baylor College of
Medicine researchers report in the New England Journal . . .
Studies of ferrets by Tufts Medical School researchers may explain
why high-dose beta carotene supplements (but not beta carotene from
real food, like carrots and yams) had raised lung cancer rates of
smokers in two studies. Dr. Xiang-Dong Wang and colleagues write in
the Journal of the National Cancer Institute that excess beta
carotene settling in the furry mammals' lungs became oxidized into
products that disrupt cell division in a way that can lead to
cancer.

TIME HAS COME FOR MILLENNIUM CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Richard Landes thinks people had a perfectly reasonable
response to his Center for Millennial Studies when it came into
being in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those few who even knew we existed, we looked kooky,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when he proposed the project to his bosses at Boston
University, where he is a professor of medieval history, Landes
recalls that they told him: ``It's OK if you want to do this, but
don't say you're at BU.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the countdown to 2000 begins in earnest, the Center for
Millennial Studies is all the rage. Media outlets from around the
world call for interviews, computer enthusiasts bookmark its Web
site (www.mille.org) for updates on the Y2K bug, and researchers
increasingly turn to the center for information about the
end-of-century proliferation of survivalists, conspiracy theorists,
UFO sighters, and religious zealots who are preparing for the
impending apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and last summer Landes and his band of young employees were
invited to move from their cramped quarters in Brookline into a
rent-free, three-room office on the BU campus. They do run the
Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University, after all.
</P>
<P>
   The center has come a long way in a short time. While other
academics and organizations are studying specific social,
technological, or religious issues surrounding the new millennium's
approach, the operation on Commonwealth Avenue appears to have
become the most extensive and ambitious anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Its stated intent is to provide analysis about current events
and compare them to previous millennial changes and, most
important, to create a comprehensive archive that will allow
scholars in the future to obtain specific data about a period that
already is drawing more interest by the day from educators,
journalists, and historians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to start a new field, like sociology,'' says
Beth Forrest, 28, the center's program coordinator. ``We're trying
to create a lens through which we can look at events and connect
them more easily.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the place where, in the next few years and far
beyond, anyone who wants information about what occurred will look
in our computers, at our files,'' adds Landes, whose passion for
his new mission mirrors that of some of the people he studies.
</P>
<P>
   In December Landes, 49, traveled to Jerusalem to spend New
Year's Eve at Temple Mount, interviewing a group of fundamentalist
Jews awaiting the arrival of the Messiah. He plans to be in
Jerusalem as often as his budget will allow in the coming year,
because he thinks it will be ground zero of religious millennial
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he says he will be in the holy city on Dec. 31,
1999, when he expects tens of thousands of pilgrims from all over
the world will converge to await salvation, destruction, the
arrival of celestial beings, the second coming of Christ,
Armageddon, or some other tumultuous permutation of apocalyptic
visions.
</P>
<P>
   Religion _ mainly Christianity, but other faiths as well _ is
one of two subjects that pervade millennial study. Many religious
zealots, and an array of more mainstream believers, attach great
significance to the arrival of the 21st century, though they don't
seem to agree on what exactly will happen.
</P>
<P>
   The second dominant theme, which Landes predicts will eclipse
President Clinton's impeachment trial as the major news event of
the coming year, is Y2K, the term coined to describe many
computers' inability to deal with dates after Dec. 31, 1999. Some
observers, including serious programmers, warn of widespread social
disruption as utilities, banks, and other essential services
collapse if the problem isn't repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Landes and his colleagues are tracking some extreme folks. Like
the ones in Indonesia who are hunting out witches to prevent them
from doing any millennial mischief, or the ones in the American
West who believe Y2K is an omen that the earth is nearing its end,
its destruction to come at the hands of aliens sent by God to
punish humanity for ruining the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the center's time is spent on more concrete matters,
however.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Landes says he hopes his research will persuade
municipalities, businesses, and individuals to take the Y2K problem
even more seriously than some already do. And he says the center's
monitoring of religious organizations could serve as an early
warning system against violence, anti-Semitism, and other negative
responses that he expects among some who will be dispirited and
angry if their expectations aren't realized in the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disappointment is the big black box in millennium studies,''
says Landes, who bases this assessment on his study of previous
millennial movements. ``I don't know how widespread, obviously, but
there's a good possibility that there will be scapegoating,
paranoia, violence, all sorts of things. If you think it's your
moment, and God is on your side, the letdown could be enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Of particular interest to the center are those who function at
the intersection of religious millennialism and the Y2K problem.
They include small groups with fanatical views who are making
arrangements to survive the chaos that a systemic computer failure
could bring, as well as clerics with large followings who see great
portent in the timing of high-tech's potential meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, for instance, has produced a video
(available for $28) on which he says that ``Y2K may be God's
instrument to shake this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   He preaches that the consequence could be a worldwide revival
preceding ``the Rapture of the Church,'' and adds that he
``wouldn't be a bit surprised'' if the Lord descended in 2000. Some
evangelical Christians believe the Rapture is when Christ returns
to Earth to take the redeemed to heaven, leaving all others to
suffer with the Antichrist.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the center foresee more discussion of this sort,
some of it in mainstream churches, as the millennium draws closer.
They say that's partly because people's imaginations _ and behavior
_ will be affected by the mysteries and possibilities that 2000
evokes, but also because of heightened media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just such a huge symbol that it's easy to get attention
by hanging anything you want onto it,'' said David Kessler, 32, the
center's executive administrator. ``The more news there is about
it, the more people seem to want to do something, anything, in
response.''
</P>
<P>
   The center is in three connected rooms that could be mistaken
for a dorm suite, if they had more furniture. It is filled with
overflowing boxes, wall posters, aging office equipment, and an
enthusiastic young staff. It sometimes seems to function less like
a specialized repository for select segments of history than the
scholarly equivalent of a vacuum cleaner, sucking in anything and
everything that might be pertinent and filing it away for some
unspecified use in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the material the half-dozen employees accumulate comes
in the form of newspaper clippings about topics as diverse as
modern fashion, magic, and ``environmental doom,'' along with
videotapes, Internet postings, pamphlets, and other literature
produced by religious sects, survivalists, conspiracy theorists,
and others who link their activities to the turn of the centuries.
Landes and his colleagues also periodically travel around the
country (and sometimes the world, as budgets allow) conducting
their own interviews to add to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Landes opened the center's doors with a grant from the Franklin
Mint (for which he works as a consultant), and it has since
received support from BU, the Lily Endowment for the Arts, the Open
Society Institute, the Massachusetts Endowment for the Humanities,
and individual contributors. Officials say they operate on a
shoestring budget, and soliciting funding clearly is an ongoing
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Landes conceived of the center while driving on a Los Angeles
freeway in 1994 with Steven O'Leary, a communications professor at
the University of Southern California who had just published a
book, ``Arguing the Apocalypse: A Theory of Millennial Rhetoric.''
The two friends turned their idea into reality when they raised
enough money two years later; though they decided to place their
headquarters in Boston, O'Leary still works with Landes from the
West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to maintaining a voluminous and entertaining Web
site, the center publishes a quarterly newsletter, hosts a monthly
discussion group, runs periodic educational programs, and sponsors
an annual conference. The last one, in Boston last month, indicated
that millennial scholars can maintain their sense of humor while
tackling momentous issues. Seminars were given titles like ``Dating
and the Millennial Imagination,'' and ``Christians Who Kill, and
the Women Who Love Them.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the grants keep coming, Landes hopes his brainchild
will thrive long after he moves on to other projects. In any case,
he figures operations will continue at least two more years _ since
the new millennium technically begins Jan. 1, 2001, notwithstanding
the popular conception that it starts in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the center already is planning its conference for 2002.
The tentative title: ``Disappointed Millennialism.''

THE WAY LAPTOPS SHOULD BE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Come gather 'round and listen to me while I sing the praises of
the new ultralight laptops.
</P>
<P>
   These new machines are laptops as they should be: superbly
light, sleek, and beautiful. Yet at the same time these
Windows-based machines are extremely fast, rivaling all but the
fastest desktops. They are capable, with ample memory banks and
hard drives. And most important, they are affordable.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the computers in this new generation of laptop
companions are far more similar than they are different. They all
have magnesium cases (for added strength), a single PCMCIA slot
(there's not room for more), external floppy disk drives (an
internal would take up too much space), and external port extenders
(no room for the connectors, either). They all come with a standard
battery, with a high-capacity available as an option. Likewise,
external CD-ROM drives are sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   The three leading notebooks in this class are the Sharp Actius
($1,812 for 64MB RAM/3.2GB HD/233Mhz; $2,134 for 64MB RAM/4.3GB
HD/266Mhz); the Sony Vaio 505 ($1,699 for 32MB RAM/4.3GB HD/233
Mhz; $1,999 for 64MB/4.3GB HD/266 Mhz); and the Toshiba Protege
7000CT ($2,672 for 32MB RAM/4.1GB HD/266 Pentium II).
</P>
<P>
   Although it's the fastest, I don't like the Toshiba because of
its pointer stick and its short battery life (80 minutes). Leaving
that one aside, comparing the Sony with the Sharp is like trying to
decide between oranges and tangerines: the Sharp is rarer and a bit
more expensive, but it is much sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharp Actius is a slim machine measuring 10 1/2 by 8 1/2 by
1 inches and weighing just 3.1 pounds; with an external battery it
weighs 4.1 pounds. Besides the PCMCIA slot there is a USB port, a
slot for a security lock, a VGA port (which is blocked by the
external battery), headphone jack, microphone jack, PS/2 mouse
jack, IR port, and a built-in 56k modem. It has a big, brilliant
11.2-inch diagonal screen and a very comfortable touchpad. The
external floppy disk drive also has the parallel port, the serial
port, and a second PS/2 jack.
</P>
<P>
   The Sony Vaio 505 is virtually the same size and weight as the
Sharp. The Sony has headphone and microphone jacks, USB, built-in
modem, and IR ports. It provides an external floppy and a separate
external port extender that has a serial port, keyboard, mouse,
VGA, and printer ports. The screen looks much smaller than Sharp's,
although it has a diagonal measurement of 10.5 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Sony does a much better job with cable management than Sharp.
The Sony power supply, for instance, has molded plastic on which
you can wind up the power cords. The Sony port extender has a slot
for stowing the cable and its connector. Overall, the Sony is a
more attractive machine.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharp does a better job where things matter _ the mechanical
and performance aspects. The Sony laptop doesn't have an internal
battery: The standard external battery lasts just two hours; the
extended battery just four. And Sony's battery is loose: Even when
it is locked in place, it rattles around. Sharp, on the other hand,
gives three hours of life off the built-in battery, and another
five from the external. That's a full day of use from the machine.
</P>
<P>
   But Sony has been selling a lot more laptops lately than Sharp,
and this experience has paid off in other ways. The Sharp laptop is
a basic brick, delivered with a virgin copy of Windows 98 and no
Sharp-specific software. You can't even turn off the tapping
feature on the touch pad, something that drives me crazy. And there
are no tools for managing the Sharp's power configuration from
within Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, meanwhile, delivers an impressive array of software with
its laptop _ much of which, truth be told, few people will actually
use. Preinstalled software includes Adobe Acrobat Reader, America
Online, CompuServe, Dr. Solomon's Anti-Virus, Dvgate, PictureGear,
VirtualKey, VoiceView, and a rather extensive set of help files.
More important in my book: It comes with BatteryScope, PowerPanel,
and an extensive Sony Notebook configuration program.
</P>
<P>
   One of the much-hyped features of the new Vaio is a touchpad
that you can use with a stylus. This lets you sign your name on the
touchpad and create a digitized signature (I can't think of many
other uses for the feature, though). I don't really like the new
touchpad: It is less responsive than the one on the Sharp or on the
previous generation of Sony laptops, the 700 series.
</P>
<P>
   My biggest problem with the Sharp is its power management. My
Actius frequently would not wake up properly from sleep or suspend
mode. Windows 98 realized that it wasn't waking up and eventually
gave me the option of disabling sleep entirely, which solved the
problem, although it's not great for one's battery life.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke with Sharp about this problem and the company said
nobody else had reported it. Of course, that's what they all say.
One power advantage that Sharp has over Sony is that the Sharp
laptop can power its external CD-ROM drive off the internal
battery, whereas Sony's external CD-ROM drive requires that you
plug it in.
</P>
<P>
   Having bought a laptop for myself in 1997 and one for my wife
last year, I'm not in the market for a new machine. But if I were,
it would be a hard decision. Certainly the Sony is a better value.
But I like the Sharp a lot better. I find the keyboard easier to
use and I like the styling of the case. It feels like a more
solidly built machine.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Sony has digital-video input, and I just
bought myself a new digital video camera (which I'll review in an
upcoming column). Chances are I would let battery life be the
deciding issue, and buy the Sharp with the external battery and
CD-ROM _ both of which cost extra.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, today I can sing the praises of these laptops
without having to buy one.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel and Steve Murray, Jill Vejnoska and Doug
Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia
Louis-Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   A multi-legged wonder. The newest computer-animated feature from
the makers of ``Toy Story'' is the eye-popping, witty tale of an
ant named Flik (voice of Dave Foley), who recruits a bunch of
circus bugs to battle evil grasshoppers (the chief villain is
voiced by Kevin Spacey). There's enough going on here to keep every
adult, child or arachnid vastly entertained. 1 hour, 34 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action'' PG-13 (profanity and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a true story, this legal thriller stars John Travolta
as a slick, small-time personal injury lawyer who tackles two giant
corporations whose careless waste management caused leukemia in a
dozen kids. Robert Duvall is his cagey opponent. Travolta is
miscast and the movie can't quite decide what its focus is. Still,
it more than makes its case with intelligence and old-fashioned
Hollywood ``let us entertain you'' craft. 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing at Lughnasa''PG (mild sexual talk)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Meryl Streep.
</P>
<P>
   Director Pat O'Connor's movie brings out all the weaknesses and
few of the strengths of Brian Friel's prize-winning play about five
unmarried sisters living in rural Ireland in the summer of 1936.
However, whatever's worth having in this movie belongs to star
Meryl Streep, who shines as the uptight, controlling oldest sister.
1 hour, 34 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta'' PG-13 (profanity, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alfre Woodard and Al Freeman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   This warm, funny, utterly engaging family film insists you can
go home again, even if you've never been there before. Alfre
Woodard stars as a messed-up Chicago single mom with two kids. Her
own mother (Mary Alice) ships her south to Mississipppi to stay
with her uncle (Al Freeman Jr.) and try to get her life straight.1
hour, 41 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' R (violence and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler. Cate Blanchett gives a luminous portrayal, and
Geoffrey Rush gives her sturdy support as court politics and
intrigues swirl about. This is a really good story. Of a girl
becoming a woman, of a woman becoming a queen. 2 hours, 4 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling paranoia plot devices from other movies (``The
Conversation,'' ``Three Days of the Condor''), Tony Scott's lively
thriller keeps Will Smith and Gene Hackman on the run from big
government bad guys. A sharp cast and slick production compensate
for the movie's occasional lapses in logic.2 hours, 7 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The Faculty'' R (profanity, violence, gore, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Elijah Wood, Jon Stewart and Bebe Neuwirth.
</P>
<P>
   Although most high school students might compare their teachers
to aliens, at Herrington High they really are. In this flimsy and
unoriginal but fun monster-thriller, the students band together to
fight their fate when they discover that their teachers, including
the football coach (Robert Patrick) and the principal (Bebe
Neuwirth), want to turn them into computer-generated creepies. (Cox
News Service)1 hour, 50 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' Not rated but contains sexual themes and
brief nudity.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliant re-imagining of the final days of gay British
director James Whale. Whale, best known for his classic horror
movies (``Bride of Frankenstein''), died mysteriously in 1957. Ian
McKellen is marvelous as a recluse who becomes interested in the
new gardener (Brendan Fraser). There's excellent work all around,
but McKellen is the movie's gnawing, unsettling center. 1 hour, 35
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' R (violence,
profanity, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jennifer Love Hewitt.
</P>
<P>
   Tepid follow-up to last year's surprise hit, this teen slasher
flick transplants surviving cast member Jennifer Love Hewitt to an
island in the Bahamas. Back-from-the-dead killer Ben Willis is
there too, intent on using his deadly fishhook hand to finally
finish off Julie and her friends. Teenage singer and TV star Brandy
is the only spirited thing about this sequel. 1 hour, 36 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Frost'' PG (mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Keaton and Kelly Preston.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Keaton plays a dead dad who comes back as a talking
snowman and teaches his son to play hockey. We're not making this
up. The synthetic, special-effects driven comedy is another of
those stale Hollywood sermons about taking time out for your kids.
It's less substantial than a snowball in July.1 hour, 36 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian Jew shields his son from the horrors of a
concentration camp by pretending their predicament is part of a
big, complicated game. It certainly takes a certain courage to put
a life-affirming spin on Hitler's Final Solution, but Benigni's
low-comedy slapstick approach isn't entirely convincing and is
often chillingly wrongheaded. In Italian with English subtitles.2
hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Voice'' R (profanity, brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jane Horrocks, Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine.
</P>
<P>
   British actress Jane Horrocks, who can belt out tone-perfect
impersonations of everyone from Judy Garland to Shirley Bassey, is
pretty much the whole show here. The rest of the film, alas, is a
fairly feeble show-biz fable in which her blowzy mom (Brenda
Blethyn) and a seedy agent (Michael Caine) try to get this shy
recluse on stage. See it for Horrocks; check out the concession
stand in between her numbers. 1 hour, 30 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Mighty Joe Young'' PG (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Paxton and Charlize Theron.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Paxton is a cute American zoologist, Charlize Theron is a
gorgeous blonde and her pal Joe is, well, a really big gorilla.
Together they stumble through the African jungle, California and,
overall, through this remake of the 1949 B-movie with shamelessly
stolen sequences from ``E.T.'' and ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
(Knight Ridder Newspapers)1 hour, 55 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams'' PG-13 (profanity, crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays a renegade med student who believes the
rigid rules of health care could use a few laughs. It's ``Dead
Poets Society'' with lab coats. The laughs are good, but when it
tries to get serious (often), the flick is as deep as a bedpan.1
hour, 56 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' PG (violence, intense themes)
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes.
</P>
<P>
   A spectacular animated musical epic that retells _ with some
embellishments _ the Book of Exodus. Val Kilmer is the voice of
Moses, God's choice to lead the Hebrew people from slavery in
Egypt. Ralph Fiennes speaks for the Pharaoh, Moses' ``adopted''
brother. Other talent includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and
a host of animators. The movie is visually impressive, insistently
reverential.1 hour, 39 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Psycho'' R (violence, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche.
</P>
<P>
   A slavishly faithful remake of the Hitchcock classic. It's very
well made and acted, with a terrific performance by Vince Vaughn as
Norman Bates. But it's an odd cinematic experiment that never seems
to know exactly what it intended to prove. 1 hour, 38 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rugrats Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of E.G. Daily and Christine Cavanaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rugrats hit the big screen with a big issue: making way for
a new baby. The film version of the TV hit is amiable, if frenetic,
aimed at kids who need to be stimulated every few seconds.1 hour,
19 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love'' R (sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Poor, overworked Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has to finish
his play ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' and try to win
the hand of noblewoman Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) in this witty comedy
that uses some of the Bard's more outrageous plot devices. The
script's cleverness can sometimes get in the way of genuine
feeling, but its ambition is refreshing. 2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan'' R (profanity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Director Sam Raimi's movie is anything but simple. It's a
character-driven black comedy with some powerful moral-qualm
undercurrents. In the deep snows of rural Minnesota, two brothers
(Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton) and a pal (Brent Briscoe) find a
downed plane with $4 million in cash. Their ``simple plan'' to
split the money leads to a chain of increasingly disastrous events.
1 hour, 57 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' PG (sci-fi violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patrick Stewart, Brent Spiner and Donna Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   The Enterprise crew saves an eternally youthful tribe from an
ugly crowd that wants to steal its juju. The movie is full of jokes
and decent special effects. But it seems primarily designed for
Trekkers who need an update on their intergalactic family album.1
hour, 44 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' PG-13 (profanity, adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts play competing moms _ one
biological, the other step _ in this comedy/weepie that tackles
some complex ``blended family'' issues, then cops out by giving a
character a fatal disease. Still, the sturdy cast does much to
redeem the mush-headed script (add Ed Harris in the dishonest role
of doting dad who somehow never sees his kids). 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The new IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a
fictional story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a
budding teenage paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her
dino-hunting dad (Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be
a dinosaur egg into his lab, Ally, alone with it, accidentally
cracks it and is thrust back in time 65 million years, when the big
beasts roamed the earth. 40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine'' PG (sexual themes, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian Bannen and David Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   A broad, twinkly Irish comedy about what happens in a tiny
village when it's discovered that one of the residents is the
holder of a lottery ticket worth nearly $7 million. The movie is a
little too eager to please, a little too Lucky Charms Irish. But
the two leads, devilish old-pro codgers Ian Bannen and David Kelly,
are practiced charmers, and there are lots of winning little
moments along the way.1 hour, 30 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' PG-13 (comic violence, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler and Kathy Bates.
</P>
<P>
   A watered-down comedy. After a successful stab at romantic
comedy in ``The Wedding Singer,'' Adam Sandler returns to his
lowbrow roots with this ``Happy Gilmore'' rewrite about a bayou
bumpkin who becomes a college football star. It's dumb and
predictable, which would be OK if there were more laughs. But Kathy
Bates is hilarious as Sandler's domineering mama. 1 hour, 26
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``You've Got Mail'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   This Internet-era update of ``The Shop Around the Corner'' stars
Tom Hanks as a book-chain magnate and Meg Ryan as the small-store
owner he's putting out of business. Little do they know that
they're each other's e-mail sweethearts. ``Sleepless in Seattle''
director Nora Ephron gets the charm working again in a remake that
delivers. 2 hours. B

IN THE NBA, IT'S TIME FOR SERIOUS FENCE-MENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next number we need to hear from the NBA should not be about
$14 million maximum salaries, or 54 percent of revenue or even 50
games on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The next number we should hear is the size of the discount for
tickets. And that number should be big, very, very big.
</P>
<P>
   Now that their 191-day financial war with the players has ended
in a lucrative truce, the owners have to play catch-up with the
public.
</P>
<P>
   After the baseball strike of 1994-95, many teams courted fans
like corporate Don Juans. They had no choice, even though it was
the players who shut down that sport.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it was the owners who closed up shop, and they made a
killing in the process. They got spectacular concessions from the
players, including the only restricted top-level salaries in
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   The concessions may have been necessary to keep the game
vibrant, to make sure that, for example, the Minnesota Timberwolves
have a prayer of keeping their young team together. But the owners
need to start wooing anyway.
</P>
<P>
   If they could afford to toss away an entire season, as they
threatened in trying to bring the players' union to heel, then now
they should be able to afford slashed ticket prices. They shut down
because they believed it would benefit them in the long term. Cheap
seats would be just another farsighted move.
</P>
<P>
   Season ticket-holders deserve breaks of up to 50 percent for
this year, 25 percent the next. Single games should be available
for 30 percent off now, 15 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to foster good will: Let each player on every roster
pick a high school that will receive 100 free tickets to one game
this season. What the heck, make it three schools. The link from
management to players to community would help heal multiple wounds.
</P>
<P>
   And really, how much would it cost the owners? For most clubs,
it's a safe bet that those 100 seats would sit empty otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the owners were heavily subsidized in this labor
battle. Their TV deal covered their backsides like a whoopee
cushion, emitting mocking sounds at everyone else who cares about
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   They have a lot of amends to make. So does the commissioner, who
passed the point of absurdity when he suggested using replacement
players next season.
</P>
<P>
   The players will be held most accountable for the poisonous
lockout, if only because they are the parties required to show
their faces when tip-off arrives. Expect them to be nicer, more
fan-friendly, just like the baseball players upon their return.
</P>
<P>
   But to repair the damage, the league has to go further than
that, particularly in making peace in its own ranks. A to-do list
for the post-lockout NBA might include: Coaches must take their
entire teams out to a pricey dinner on every road trip. It's the
least they can do, since they kept making money during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the proposed deal dramatically closes the gap
between their salaries and those of the stars. And the coaches
don't have a top-tier pay scale. If some teams want to offer Phil
Jackson more than Shaquille O'Neal makes, they aren't contractually
forbidden to do so.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, the new deal with the players frees up more
money to pay coaches, who may make seven-figure salaries for many,
many years. Their careers can't be abbreviated by bad knees or the
arrival of gray hair.
</P>
<P>
   The owners need to find a way to convince the fans that the
players capitulated because they really love the game. In most
cases, this is probably the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Jayson Williams, the teddy bear of the lockout, constantly
talked about the fans, about how they were cheated, about the
stupidity of the fight for huge sums of money. He spewed some
nonsense, too, but as a pending free agent, he had everything to
gain by cheerleading for the union to fight restrictions on
high-end salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new agreement, he can't make as much as Kevin Garnett,
who has a deal worth $21 million a year. Neither can Scottie
Pippen, who was grossly underpaid last year. Tim Duncan, a
superstar for the next generation, stands to make roughly half of
Garnett's salary.
</P>
<P>
   That's not exactly sacrifice, but compared to what the owners
have done to keep the game going, it's everything.

 &HT;    An ambulance-chasing lawyer discovers a cause greater than money
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action'' begins with a cynical voice-over. Jan
Schlichtmann (John Travolta), a hugely successful personal injury
lawyer _ read ``ambulance chaser'' in the minds of his colleagues _
is spelling out the rules of his particular niche of the legal
profession. ``A dead plaintiff is rarely worth as much as a
severely maimed one,'' he explains. He then goes through a litany
of who's worth what: whites more than blacks, men more than women,
etc., concluding with the unapologetic assessment, ``In the
calculus of personal injury law, a dead child is worth the least of
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of ``A Civil Action,'' based on Jonathan Harr's
nonfiction best seller, Schlichtmann will learn a new definition of
the word ``worth.'' He'll learn to apply it to phrases like
``self-worth'' and ``worth fighting for,'' as opposed to a dollar
amount.
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows a real-life legal battle that took place in
the 1980s. In the small blue-collar town of Woburn, Mass., 12
children died of leukemia in 15 years. In the movie, Schlichtmann
is cornered into talking to the families after the mother (Kathleen
Quinlan) of one of the dead children catches him waxing
Clinton-esque on a radio talk show. She phones in and suggests,
``Why don't you come up to Woburn and meet some of the people whose
pain is your pain?''
</P>
<P>
   He does, and tries to wriggle out of taking the case. Then he
learns that two giant corporations happen to operate plants near
Woburn's water supply. He doesn't smell toxic waste; he doesn't
need to. He smells money.
</P>
<P>
   In another voice-over, Schlichtmann confides that the whole
point of a lawsuit is to get the other side to settle. That going
to trial is suicide. But for once, something in Schlichtmann won't
settle. ``Only those with something to prove end up in court,'' he
tells us. Yet that's exactly where he ends up, going toe to toe
with Jerome Facher (Robert Duvall), a cagey counselor from the old
school.
</P>
<P>
   Facher represents everything to which Schlichtmann aspires:
professional respect, the right connections, etc. Plus, Facher can
outslick Schlichtmann. Warning him to settle out of court, Facher
says matter-of-factly, ``I'm only going to hurt you, so get rid of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his character, Travolta apparently has something he needs
to prove. He wants to show us that he's more than the supremely
talented ironist who has done such brilliant work in films like
``Pulp Fiction'' and ``Primary Colors.'' But, marvelous actor that
he is, Travolta is simply miscast here. He excels at creating fully
formed characters, then revealing aspects of that character in
different situations. He's not nearly as adept at portraying a
character who evolves, as Schlichtmann supposedly does.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Duvall, in a role that an older Travolta could have
done well, wipes up the screen with him. Everything he does is
fascinating, from his folksy, distracted manner to his casual
wiliness.
</P>
<P>
   There's also excellent work in the supporting roles: John
Lithgow and Kathy Bates as two very different judges; Tony Shalhoub
as Travolta's partner; William H. Macy, who provides comic relief
as Travolta's increasingly desperate financial adviser; and, most
especially, director and sometime actor Sydney Pollack as a coolly
confident corporate type whose tools of intimidation range from the
Harvard Club to rickety antique tables.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the center doesn't completely hold. Part of the problem
is Travolta; part of it is that writer-director Steven Zaillian
can't decide whether his movie is about the corruption of the legal
system, the redemption of a single lawyer or how justice worked (or
didn't work) in Woburn.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the movie held me every step of the way. It has been
done with intelligence, assurance and just the right dash of
Hollywood ``let us entertain you'' showboating. To a critic's eye,
it remains flawed. To a critic's heart, it's a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall. Directed by Steven
Zaillian. Rated PG-13 for language and mature themes (deaths of
children). 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Travolta is miscast, but the movie makes its case.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ When Radcliffe president Linda Wilson posed
with the heads of the other Seven Sisters colleges for the November
issue of Vanity Fair, she had a decision to make. The magazine had
deemed the septet to be among America's Most Influential Women, and
had layed out a series of conservative presidential outfits for
them to choose among. Tweeds and muted colors, please.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there was this one cherry red dress,'' Wilson recalls,
smiling. ``And Radcliffe's color is cherry red. So there really was
no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally. To the 62-year-old Wilson, Radcliffe is not only a
college but a cause. This is especially so these days, when the
school's future relationship with Harvard is under seemingly
interminable secret negotiation. (This much is certain: the current
marriage is confusing. See page.) Wilson is at the center of these
delicate talks, which means that she is a focal point for the
various Radcliffe constituencies that debate the school's days
ahead, from Manhattan co-ops to Cambridge cappuccino bars. ``The
talk about what might happen is everywhere,'' muses Mary Maples
Dunn, the former president of Smith College who now runs
Radcliffe's Schlesinger Library. ``Everybody is speculating.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystery is aided and abetted by the fact that Wilson, who is
only Radcliffe's seventh president in its 120-year history, is
something of a enigma. Despite the fact she's clearly the boss, and
despite her 16-hour workdays, many in the Radcliffe constellation
say they simply don't have a handle on this reserved onetime
research chemist, even after she's been on the job for nearly a
decade. Some are particularly puzzled by her reluctance to publicly
say how she believes Radcliffe and Harvard should or shouldn't be
linked.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Reeves, president of the Radcliffe Club of New York, is
typical of Cliffies who say they don't have a complete picture of
Wilson. ``I'm a very active alum, and we see each other in various
contexts,'' Reeves says. ``But, you know, I just don't know her
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after recently taking a 10-city tour intended to give
alumnae what she calls a ``participation opportunity'' in
Radcliffe's uncertain future _ for which she personally booked the
conference rooms _ Wilson remains an elusive figure turned out in
catalog-bought clothes and oversize eyeglasses. Thoughtful,
deliberate, and analytical, with a legendary memory for details,
she is not given to small talk despite her graciousness. Especially
when the subject is Linda Wilson. ``She simply thinks what she has
to say about herself isn't that interesting,'' offers her husband
of nearly 29 years, Paul Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And so there's this questioning buzz. Like, wasn't she a
debutante in New Orleans? (No.) Isn't she something of a sailor?
(Yes.) Didn't she and her husband once take a cross-country
motorcycle tour? (Sort of.) ``She's understated, which kind of
confuses people,'' says Amey DeFriez, class of '49 and former
chairwoman of the board of trustees, one of the very few locals who
call Wilson a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Such close relationships are a luxury that Wilson's unrelenting
work style, which she is able to crank up on only five hours'
sleep, does not permit. ``There's not a lot of time to nurture
friendships,'' she confesses. She can often be seen toting a
20-pound briefcase home at night, leaving her massive desk with its
tall piles of papers and crossing Radcliffe Yard at a steady gait.
At well-shaded Greenleaf House, the president's residence on
Brattle Street, she and her husband hunker down mostly on the
second and third floors of the mid-19th-century brick manse,
leaving the first floor, with its 16-foot ceilings, primarily for
entertaining. Paul Wilson does most of the cooking. For his wife,
relaxation consists mainly of reading (``Airport kind of stuff''),
and an occasional British comedy on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's Maine, of course. Four years ago, the Wilsons purchased
a 7-acre spread in the hamlet of Walpole, on the Damariscotta
River. It is there, amid the pine and the spruce, that Linda Wilson
can play Bach and Beethoven on her Baldwin baby grand in the newly
added music room. Or go ocean sailing in the 36-foot boat she and
her husband took a decade to build. Or dote on her four
grandchildren when they show up for visits. (She and her husband
each has a grown daughter by a previous marriage.) Or frolick with
Corey the Australian shepherd, as well as Striper and Sophie, the
cats. Or even go snowshoeing in the woods. ``We have a
real-human-being life up there,'' she marvels.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cambridge is never far away. The faxes and the Fed-Ex
packages fly in and out. Wilson often takes a bus and the T back to
Cambridge, leaving her husband behind. True, she has spent much of
the past two summers in Walpole, but the result has been a kind of
Radcliffe North. ``It's ludicrous to call it a vacation,'' Paul
Wilson says.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows Radcliffe is not an easy ship to pilot. Oddly
constructed, riding the ebbs and flows of its proprietary alumnae,
it must also sail among the strong and changeable winds of Harvard.
``There are people at Harvard who wish Radcliffe didn't exist,''
says Susan Eaton, secretary of the Radcliffe College Alumnae
Association. Most Cliffies can cite an assortment of snubs, most
notably the 1997 Harvard report on fund-raising among women that
was undertaken without consulting Radcliffe and didn't even mention
the school. ``I've seen Harvard men sit in our living room and tell
Linda to her face that Radcliffe should get out of the education
business and give up its buildings,'' Paul Wilson laments.
</P>
<P>
   Ever-polite, ever-measured, Linda Wilson weighs her responses to
this kind of stuff carefully. At her feistiest _ at least publicly
_ she might say: ``At Radcliffe, we are very much focused on women
and gender. Harvard has just begun to think about women, to pay
attention to them. So the natural assumption for some people at
Harvard is to say, `Oh, since we're thinking about women now, we
don't need Radcliffe anymore.' Kind of a naive assumption, I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite her distinct lack of a southern accent, Wilson was
raised in New Orleans. No, there were no cotillions in her
middle-class upbringing, although she learned everything from
public speaking to Shakespeare at Mrs. Nunguesser's Speech School.
She was valedictorian of her high school class and an eager
performer on several musical instruments. ``I took up chemistry in
high school because my father said you needed chemistry if you were
going to be able to cook,'' she remembers, but she also liked the
intellectual orderliness it demanded. Indeed, chemistry became her
major at all-female Sophie Newcomb College, the women's wing of
Tulane University, in part because she wanted to prove that she was
the intellectual equal of her older sister, Sylvia, who had gone
north to _ yipes _ Radcliffe. ``There was a little bit of a sibling
rivalry there because of my staying in New Orleans,'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Married at 20, she was a mother at 24 and an ex-wife at 32. ``My
first husband and I married when we were too young, and we really
didn't know each other very well,'' she says. ``It was a
relationship in which I wasn't able to be independent. At work, I
was very engaging. At home, I would rarely say anything because my
husband kind of kept the floor.''

</P>
<P>
   SCI-FIDGET-DIET (Undated) _ It must have been a couch potato's
dream: an announcement that the Mayo Clinic was looking for
volunteers ``willing to overeat for the sake of science.'' Not only
would they have to eat 1,000 extra calories a day, in the form of
favorite foods temptingly prepared by expert cooks, but they would
also have to refrain from exercising. Now, after three years, the
researchers have concluded that the reason some people stay slim no

   MARKET (New York) _ At midday, the industrial average was off 56
points, or 0.6 percent, and the Nasdaq index was flat. Elsewhere,
prices rose half a percent in Tokyo and 4.5 percent in Hong Kong.
They fell 1.8 percent in Frankfurt, 1 percent in London, 5.4
percent in Brazil and 1.4 percent in Mexico. On the American debt
market, the long bond was off a full point, with the yield at 5.23
percent. By Robert D. Hershey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   RETAIL-SALES (Undated) _ Retailers' same-store sales rose in
December as consumers sought bargains on toys and home goods at
Wal-Mart and other discount chains and fashions at specialty stores
like Ann Taylor. Among others, Federated and May exceeded
expectations, reporting sales increases of 5.7 percent and 4.4
percent, respectively. But it was a disappointing holiday season
for J.C. Penney: The company says that same-store sales decreased
7.6 percent and that earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter will
fall short of expectations. By Leslie Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   DEBEERS-DIAMONDS (Johannesburg) _ The DeBeers diamond cartel has
been run by South Africa's Oppenheimer family for a century, and
now the third generation has taken over in the person of Nicholas
Frank Oppenheimer. It is not an easy time; some weeks ago, DeBeers
announced that, because of falling Asian demand, it had sold the
fewest diamonds in 12 years, a mere $3.4 billion worth. Mines are
cutting back, and the executives admit to sleepless nights. But not
to panic. This has happened to DeBeers before. By Donald G. McNeil
Jr.

   BROKER-EARNINGS (New York) _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's profit
from operations rose 8.5 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter, to
$1.49 a share, well above expectations. Including a gain from the
company's sales of its securities custody and credit card
processing businesses, net income was $2.07 a share. Morgan Stanley
shares, which jumped 7.6 percent on Wednesday. Lehman Brothers'
earnings fell 60 percent in the fourth quarter as revenue from
trading plunged, but the results were better than analysts
expected. By Timothy L. O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-RATES (London) _ The Bank of England cuts its benchmark
interest rate to 6 percent from 6.25 percent, saying domestic and
international economic conditions have worsened. The central bank
of another non-euro country, Denmark, also lowers rates, in order
to maintain currency stability, while the European Central Bank
keeps its benchmark rate unchanged. By Alan Cowell.

AT U.S. NEWS, NEWS IS BREAKING AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wayward newsweekly _ U.S. News &AMP; World Report _ may be
rounding into shape just in time for the Washington spectacle of
the century. With the impeachment trial looming, observers are
crediting new editor Stephen Smith with refocusing the magazine on
the Beltway buzz. This past summer, Smith replaced deposed editor
James Fallows, who was accused of not sufficiently heeding the call
of breaking news.
</P>
<P>
   Although one Smith fan calls him a ``cruise liner'' editor who
will make changes gradually and smoothly, some differences are
already apparent. His rival newsweeklies were said to have coveted
the savvy cover story Nov. 9 on the Thomas Jefferson DNA
controversy. And the Dec. 28 ``War on Two Fronts'' cover story,
which carried news of the Clinton impeachment vote and resignation
of incoming House Speaker Bob Livingston, was an example of the
magazine's wisely extending its usual Friday midnight deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to respond to the news quickly,'' says Smith,
conceding that ``we've had a very lucky six months.'' In addition,
he has started filling the masthead with his own troops, recruiting
Brian Kelly from The Washington Post and Brian Duffy from The Wall
Street Journal, bringing back Michael Barone as a columnist, and
announcing Wednesday the hiring of Slate magazine's Washington
editor Jodie Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Given U.S. News's perennial third-place status behind Time and
Newsweek, even some of Smith's admirers wonder whether his
competing more directly on the week's big news is wise or whether
the magazine should seek an alternative niche.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to compete with Time and Newsweek, but on our own
terms,'' says Smith. ``I think there are differences in pace and
story selection that really do distinguish us.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating, Smith says U.S. News is more focused on ``service
journalism,'' and that ``we don't cover celebrities, or Hollywood
or entertainment culture.'' One can presumably chalk that up as a
comment on Newsweek's recent Martha Stewart and Nicole Kidman
covers.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   To a cynic, TV Guide's four-part investigative series on CNN's
Operation Tailwind story might look like another installment in the
grudge match between its owner Rupert Murdoch and CNN boss Ted
Turner. (Two years ago, Turner challenged Murdoch to a boxing
match. Last year, Murdoch challenged Turner's Atlanta Braves by
buying the rival Los Angeles Dodgers.)
</P>
<P>
   So the idea of TV Guide's performing a post-mortem on the June 7
Tailwind fiasco _ when CNN alleged, and later retracted, that the
United States used nerve gas in Laos on a 1970 mission to kill
defectors _ raised a few eyebrows. ``People like to have their
conspiracy theories about this,'' says a TV Guide spokeswoman,
Rachel Breinin. ``We've been forced to be defensive.''
</P>
<P>
   While it can't be considered an endorsement of the Tailwind
findings or a flattering look at CNN, TV Guide paints a
surprisingly sympathetic portrait of the fired producers _ April
Oliver and Jack Smith _ behind the Tailwind story. And it raises
questions about whether their vigorous defense of the story
deserves more attention.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the magazine portrays vacillating Admiral
Thomas Moorer _ a key source who later reversed himself _ as having
given Oliver reason to think the nerve gas story was true. It
reveals that while the Pentagon and people like Henry Kissinger
stonewalled CNN's requests for information, they were considerably
more forthcoming in aiding the vigorous counterattack against CNN.
The series also notes how that backlash was driven by the
military's disdain for Tailwind story narrator Peter Arnett's role
as a reporter in Iraq during the Gulf War and by the smoldering
resentment toward Turner's wife _ Jane Fonda _ for her anti-Vietnam
War activities.
</P>
<P>
   CNN has no comment on the TV Guide stories (the final
installment will hit the newsstand next week) other than to
reiterate its earlier retraction and apology. But Mary Murphy, the
TV Guide senior writer who helped produce the series, acknowledges
that ``you cannot just dismiss this woman (Oliver) and you cannot
dismiss Jack Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she believes Smith and Oliver may have actually had the
story right, she says: ``It's very, very unclear to me.'' It may
simply have been a case of two journalists' having stumbled onto
``an unprovable story.''

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.: ... the floor.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a PhD in inorganic chemistry from the University of
Wisconsin, she had already switched from research to administration
because the chemistry departments at most first-rate universities
didn't particularly cotton to women. When she met her second
husband during the late 1960s, he was a $450-a-month United Church
of Christ minister. (He recently retired from a string of teaching
and research posts in social work.) On their first date, they took
their daughters, who were the same age, to a zoo. After they'd been
married eight years, they climbed aboard Paul Wilson's BMW
motorcycle and drove from their home in Illinois to New Brunswick
and back again. ``For the first time since I was a child, I just
daydreamed,'' recalls Linda Wilson. ``It was really the first time
I had time to be.''
</P>
<P>
   There haven't been many since. Wilson worked her way up through
a succession of time-consuming academic jobs, finally becoming the
vice president for research at the University of Michigan in 1985.
When Radcliffe came calling four years later, she looked at the
offer like any other problem to be thoroughly analyzed from all
sides: ``Paul and I sat on the boat over Memorial Day weekend and
talked the offer up one side and down the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson earns high grades for launching Radcliffe's respected
Public Policy Institute, for thematically stitching together its
quartet of such centers for advanced study, and for undertaking an
eight-year, $100 million capital campaign. (With less than two
years to go, however, the effort is about $30 million short of its
goal.) But some, alumnae in particular, wish she could somehow shed
her public reserve. ``She's not an effusive, charismatic kind of
leader, and that's been a disappointment to people,'' says Renee
Landers, class of '77, a former alumnae association president and
onetime member of the Harvard Board of Overseers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a woman of strong feelings which aren't apparent,''
concedes her friend, DeFriez. ``Some people want her to have more
funny stories when she speaks. Well, that's not her style.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it's not merely a matter of rattling off a few after-dinner
jokes. ``Bringing forth her convictions and letting you know what
they are are are not Linda Wilson's style,'' says Peggy McIntosh,
class of `56, who resigned as second vice president of the
association in April because of the secrecy that she felt
surrounded the ongoing discussions with Harvard. ``I miss in her a
sense of what her core beliefs are.'' Nevertheless, McIntosh says
she empathizes with anyone trying to run such an oddly shaped
institution as Radcliffe. And Wilson does have a oft-repeated
mission statement, however broad: to advance society by advancing
women. ``By that'' she explains, ``I mean we believe society will
be improved if women's talents are given opportunities and if we
all understand gender and work together as partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, partnership. It is a theme that runs through much of what
Wilson says. Synonyms abound: collaboration, sharing, even
``deconstructing the adversarial paradigms.'' Confrontation and
competition are to be avoided. ``She abhors the notion of a
competitive mode in education,'' says her husband. ``She believes
strongly in collaborative work.'' It's a notion that obviously
governs her second marriage, which by all accounts is as good as
her first one was bad. ``Paul and I are very, very close friends,''
Wilson says. ``He's been a wonderful partner to me in terms of my
professional life. We do a lot of projects together, and I like
being the helper. I like anticipating what tool he's going to
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating what Harvard might need _ or want _ in its current
negotiations with Radcliffe may be more problematical. Will
Radcliffe give up its lingering claims on female undergraduates,
consisting today only of extracurricular programs? Surrender some
of its real estate? Agree to alter the crucial agreement that
allows it exclusively to solicit pre-1977 alumnae for donations?
Become a research institute focused on women and gender? None of
the above?
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of other players in this little drama,
including Radcliffe's board of trustees, but it is Wilson who has
been meeting from time to time with Harvard president Neil
Rudenstine on the subject. She is typically circumspect about
what's being said and what she'd like Radcliffe to become, in this
case slipping into pure president-speak: ``Something will happen
when it's ready to happen. If it happens at all. If we don't choose
to do anything, nothing will happen. If we do change something, it
might be marginal. It might be non-marginal.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But will someone who talks so often of collaboration and
partnership be willing to play hardball if necessary? ``She won't
stand out in front of the Coop and take on Neil Rudenstine, but
she'll be effective in her own way,'' predicts DeFriez. Paul Wilson
is more blunt: ``She's got a rod of steel up her spine. If those
people are fooled by her natural inclination to be gracious and
patient, they're making a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson herself, of course, doesn't think it will come down to a
firefight. ``Radcliffe is the driver in these conversations,'' she
insists. ``Some people _ some of my alumni _ have characterized
this as if Harvard were doing something to Radcliffe. Some of my
alumni worry about that. But I've been very clear: We're in control
of our own destiny here. No one's doing anything to us. It's a
matter of the leaders of two institutions thinking about what's
wise.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the notion that Radcliffe will disappear, thereby making
Wilson its last president, she demurs. ``People love to strive for
some apocryphal end, but I don't see it that way,'' she says.
``It's part of this whole polarizing approach. People dichotomize
things. They stereotype things as a way of drawing out a definitive
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Linda Wilson declared that Harvard is a
supertanker and Radcliffe is a canoe. Should you suggest that a
tanker can easily swamp a canoe, she suggests that you're missing
the metaphor. ``What I meant was that a supertanker takes a long
time to turn, while a canoe has lots of flexibility,'' she points
out. ``Yes, it's true we could be swamped by Harvard. But we're
pretty good canoeists over here. We know how to maneuver.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

THE RADCLIFFE-HARVARD DILEMMA &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nature of Radcliffe's current relationship to Harvard _
defined largely by a five-page, 14-paragraph agreement signed by
the presidents of both schools in 1977 _ is something of a mystery
even to members of the university family. Are the two schools
spouses? Siblings? Cousins? The connection is anything but a simple
one, so pay attention:
</P>
<P>
   Undergraduate women apply to Harvard, are admitted to Radcliffe,
and are enrolled at both. They are taught by Harvard faculty
members and live in Harvard dorms. Harvard receives their tuition
and fee revenue, although this money _ about $65 million a year _
is initially collected by Radcliffe. Women undergraduates receive
Harvard diplomas, but they are signed by both the president of
Radcliffe and the president of Harvard. Radcliffe funds its own
alumnae association, although graduates are also members of the
Harvard Alumni Association.
</P>
<P>
   Radcliffe offers a number of graduate programs, but awards no
graduate degrees (or degrees of any kind, other than honorary). It
operates four institutes for advanced study. The college is
governed by a 29-member board of trustees, which is responsible
unto itself. It owns 37 buildings on 20 prime acres of land in
Cambridge, but occupies only about half of these structures.
(Harvard uses the rest, paying rents that are below market value.)
It has its own endowment of about $200 million.

INTERNET STOCKS CONTINUE TO RISE _ BUT FOR HOW LONG? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe McNay wasn't in Arizona for the warm weather.
</P>
<P>
   McNay, chairman of Boston's Essex Investment Management, was
hunkered down indoors for nonstop sessions with leading industry
executives at the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Internet and
Technology Conference in sunny Scottsdale Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Internet stocks themselves were going bonkers again.
The list is long and mind-boggling: eBay Inc. soared 59 to 283,
Amazon.com jumped a mere 13 1/2 to 138, and Yahoo Inc. advanced 33
1/8 to 291, to name a few. CMGI Inc. of Andover gained 30 9/32 to
151, doubling in price in just over three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Few people are making money on these surreal price moves like
McNay, one of the most prominent Internet investors in Boston. Like
many other people, he remains a big believer in the Web but has
questions about the level of stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ramp-up is bigger, faster, and broader, and the
invasiveness in our daily lives is exceeding what was expected and
the signs are that that will continue,'' said McNay. ``That still
leaves many wondering how you can stand the (stock) valuations and,
I must admit, it is a question.''
</P>
<P>
   Essex, which invests about $5 billion for clients, substantially
reduced its Internet holdings and took profits about a month ago
because prices had ballooned so dramatically. But in most cases,
those stocks only continued to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear now that the holiday season was a huge retail
success for the Internet, a factor that is helping fuel the boom.
</P>
<P>
   But McNay said increased attention from big institutional
investors _ and he was surrounded by them at sessions Wednesday _
appear to be a powerful new source of demand for Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six and nine months ago, the question from my clients was `How
can you own these?' The question now coming to the bigger
institutions is `Why don't you own these?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the element of Internet stocks that resemble a runaway train
scares many mutual fund managers and other long-term institutional
investors.
</P>
<P>
   One example: Henry Blodget, an analyst at CIBC Oppenheimer, who
seemed to raise the Internet audacity bar to new heights on Dec.
16.
</P>
<P>
   Blodget told the world he believed Amazon.com, already trading
at a heady 243 per share, could hit 400 in a year. He issued the
new forecast because Amazon had blown through his old price target
of 150 in a blur.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has since split 3 for 1. Its closing price today would
have been 414 without the split. Blodget's prediction had come true
in three weeks, boosting Amazon's stock market value to $21.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Soaring Internet stocks create a problem for analysts trying to
build business-forecasting models that lead to price targets for
the companies they follow. What do you do when a stock doubles in
price to reach an aggressive target within weeks?
</P>
<P>
   If the momentum of investor enthusiasm keeps pushing prices
higher, so be it. Who is going to advise investors to jump off the
rocket that continues to make them huge profits?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep in mind that our job is to help our customers
make money,'' said analyst Lauren Cooks Levitan of BancBoston
Robertson Stephens. She maintains a ``buy'' rating on Amazon.com,
which has nearly quadrupled in price in the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all try to create models to get a sense of what we think
the future will be,'' she said. ``The reality is that it's always
an estimate. The range of possibilities (with Internet retailers)
is so dramatic it's hard to arrive at any one point.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet stocks may build businesses that justify their
enormous stock prices. But even with revenues racing ahead, it's
not so clear how long it will take.
</P>
<P>
   The huge price advance reminds Syl Marquardt, equity research
director at John Hancock Advisors, of the market for computer
stocks in the early 1980s and demand for cable television stocks
later in the decade. Both industries met the spectacular goals
investors had set, but it took years and many competitors
disappeared in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   ``As investors perceived, personal computers did encircle the
planet. It just took 10 years longer than they expected,'' said
Marquardt. ``Many of the companies are successful, but dozens of
them disappeared.'' Does anyone remember Pandon Computer?
</P>
<P>
   For now, investors like Joe McNay are watching the Internet
world with keen attention and enjoying the market. He expects a
correction at some point and thinks a flood of Web initial public
stock offerings may be the trigger. But when?
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think this is the revolution of our lifetime,'' said
McNay. ``But everything is a value at some point and everything is
a risk at some point.''

SNOW GUNS MAKING IT A TYPICAL WINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEBANON, N.H. _ Every weekday afternoon busses full of kids roll
into the parking lot at Whaleback Ski Area. High school ski racers
spend the winter banging through slalom gates, run after run,
trying to shave tenths of a second off their time.
</P>
<P>
   When the school teams pull out, there's hardly a break for
dinner before the first cars pull in with skiers who have worked
all day and want to get in a few runs under the lights.
</P>
<P>
   Small by some standards (700 vertical feet), Whaleback manages
to work the clock and always seems busy. Though it was a week late
opening this season (Dec. 21), according to manager Tim Herbert, a
combination of man-made and natural snow _ heavy on the man-made _
got it through the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of storms have come through ski country since, but
still the reliance has been on the man-made stuff, and as January
takes hold with its cold temperatures and new schedules, Whaleback
and other areas have all the appearance of a typical winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, so good,'' said Herbert, who felt the cold weather
came just in time to rescue many areas from a holiday fate too grim
to contemplate. ``We have more trails off the summit and we had a
pretty strong holiday. I'm pleasantly surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar stories were being told across ski country last week,
where once again snowmaking saved the day at the most important
time of the year _ both for skiers and ski areas. Little natural
snow fell between Christmas and New Year's but according to Alice
Pearce, director of Ski New Hampshire, the crowds showed up anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the areas were slightly off last year's pace,'' Pearce
said, ``but that was a fantastic Christmas. But, for example, Loon
was only off 3,000 skiers from last year's record high.''
</P>
<P>
   And while areas such as Gunstock and Cannon were off in overall
skiers, they both experienced a big jump in their school enrollment
figures, suggesting that new skiers and boarders were taking up the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of January 3d,'' said Pearce, ``it's been
cold enough to pour on the snow around the clock. There's been so
much cold weather that all the areas have good momentum heading
toward Martin Luther King weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the Connecticut River in Vermont, the scene over the
holidays was similar _ a fairly steady flow of skiers at areas that
were, on average, only about 40 percent open.
</P>
<P>
   ``With next to no natural snow,'' said Molly Maher Kerr of the
Vermont Ski Areas Association, ``we did fairly well, though we're
not jumping up and down. We'll be playing catch-up for the rest of
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The question always asked of area operators is whether skiers
who have not seen snow locally (backyard syndrome) trust the fact
that snowguns have been whirring for weeks. With Christmas and New
Year's coming just before weekends, the timing worked in favor of a
big turnout, and despite a warm, slow start to the season, Okemo
was swamped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's partly the way the holidays fell,'' said Okemo's Pam
Cruickshank, ``but also people were really ready to ski.''
</P>
<P>
   Many areas were helped by advanced booking of vacationers. At
Vermont's Ascutney, for example, skier days were slightly off over
last season, ``but in terms of overnight guests we were ahead,''
said Ascutney's Dave Kulis.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, the two big areas _ Sunday River and Sugarloaf _ had
strong destination bookings over the period, then got a bonus with
a big dump of natural snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow, snow, snow,'' said Leah Stevens, communications director
at Sugarloaf, which now has 75 percent of its terrain open. Even
before the last big dump Sunday, which hit Maine with more than 8
inches of new snow, Sunday River had about 70 trails open on all
its eight peaks, and Sugarloaf had enough skiing on its long
cruising trails to handle the near-capacity crowds, most of which
had booked in advance. ``But even skiers who drove up here from the
south said they were really suprised to see all the snow. And
destination people just made a commitment to go skiing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sugarloaf plans to have 80 runs open this weekend and, like most
areas, works hard to get skiers to the slopes in January, usually a
flat month. Some of the best deals are available now.
</P>
<P>
   During White White World Jan. 25-29 , for example, ski and stay
packages at Sugarloaf sell for $59.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a heavy snowmaking month, so skiers who like that really
smooth cruising snow, this is a good time for them,'' said Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Fendler, who skied with two friends at Loon over New
Year's, said that while the conditions were not perfect, ``the snow
held up, and there was plenty open. My girlfriend is just learning,
so she took a lesson . . . everything was great. I have another two
weeks off (from college classes) and I plan to spend most of them
here.''

</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH _ Does the Senate impeachment trial of Clinton get
beyond the ceremonial reading of the articles of impeachment and
swearing in of Rehnquist and the Senate? (Foskett/Carr, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   WITH
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ The White House warned Thursday
that if the Senate insists on hearing witnesses in the impeachment
trial of President Clinton, a long and complicated trial was
likely. ``It will significantly extend and delay this process and
all bets are off,'' said spokesman Joe Lockhart. If Clinton's
defense insists on using every legal tool available, as expected,
the trial could easily last months. (Deans, Cox News Sertvice).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-LEGAL _ WASHINGTON _ What legal resources are available
to President Clinton and the House prosecutors if a full-blown
trial ensues? Clinton's private lawyers, presumably, can expand
their staff at will, but can outside teams also assist the House
managers? What will it cost, and who will pay? (Malone, Cox News
Service).

   IMPEACH-SCENE _ WASHINGTON _ TA pair of solemn and symbol-laden
ceremonies opened the impeachment trial of President Clinton on
Thursday. It was the stuff of history for the American public to
view, even as the politically charged details of the trial were
bein worked out in secret negotiations. (Dart, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOLS-ACCOUNTABLE _ WASHINGTON _ Many states have pledged to
hold schools more accountable for the low academic performance of
students, but few have made good on their threats, according to a
state-by-state report to be released Thursday by Education Week
magazine. (Monroe, Cox News Service).

   (For Palm Beach) TAX-DROLLETTE _ WASHINGTON _ Ernest J.
Drollette's decision to create an Employee Stock Ownership Plan for
his commuter airline could cost him $24.9 million in back taxes and
penalties. The Boca Raton businessman and his wife, Barbara M.,
filed a petition asking the U.S. Tax Court here to overturn the
Internal Revenue Service demand for the additional payments for the
1994-98 tax years. (Moskal, Cox News Service 550).

   OLYMPICS-TRIAL _ Opening arguments begin in civil trial
involving people who bought kiosks to sell souvenirs during the
Atlanta Olympics. They're suing Creative Travel trying to get back
$6 million they invested in what they call a scam. Defendants
reaction in court papers is essentially, it wasn't our fault or,
you can't prove it. (Croft, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   GA-LEGIS-PRISONS _ The loud promises of law and order candidates
are now turning into dollars, as the state is forced to consider
rapidly expanding its prison system to accommodate the tougher
sentencing promised by legislator and forced on judges. If you
include prison medical facilities, it costs more than $100 per day

   SUN-DAGGER _ Determining whether Native Americans, particularly
the Plains Indians, were astronomically literate is difficult
because most were nomadic and left few artifacts. But UT astronomer
Bob Robbins announced at this week's astronomers meeting in Austin
a tentative find of solstice literacy in a rock painting of
uncertain dating near San Angelo. At the winter solstice, the sun
shines through a crack in nearby rocks to make a V-shaped ``sun
dagger'' on a painting thought to symbolize a meeting of five

ROBINSON BELIEVES FALCONS ARE FOR REAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He looks around his locker room these days and, well,
Eugene Robinson thinks he's seen it all before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm experiencing deja vu,'' the veteran Atlanta safety says.
``I tell the guys, `You may not feel it, but I do.' Back in Green
Bay, we had the same feeling of confidence. The same thing is going
on here. I tell them, `Keep that attitude and trust me.' It feels
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was a safety on the Packers' Super Bowl champion two
seasons ago and on last year's runner-up. He's been around. This is
his 14th NFL season but his first in Atlanta. He has watched his
new team grow, mature, blossom, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta finished the regular season 14-2 and hosts its first
playoff game since 1981, and only the third in franchise history,
Saturday against the 49ers. The Falcons may well be the surprise
team of the season, but Robinson says he had a feeling it might end
up like this when he signed with Atlanta last summer.
</P>
<P>
   How could a Packer leave Green Bay for a team whose entire
playoff history takes up three pages in the Atlanta media guide?
Robinson says he got the same question from friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``People actually were calling me and offering their
condolences,'' he says. ``They were saying, `You left a good team
and you're never going to see the playoffs again.' Well, I told
them that this team finished the year 6-2, and when I did get here,
I was pleasantly surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw an offense that looked promising behind veteran
quarterback Chris Chandler and running back Jamal Anderson. He said
to himself, ``These guys are good,'' and the Falcons quietly piled
up W after W when the season started.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the turning point, which, according to Robinson, came
in Foxborough Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were telling me, `Too bad you're going up to play New
England. Sorry for you,' '' he recalls. ``Then we beat them up
pretty bad (41-10). I think everything flipped that day. A team is
characterized by something, and that characterization is getting it
done on the road against a good team. If we lose that game, maybe
it's a different season. Maybe you don't think you got it. But now
these guys, they think they got it. If people are really surprised
with what we're doing, that's OK with me. We'll be the best-kept
secret in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson grew up in Hartford, matriculated at Weaver High (alma
mater of Rick Mahorn and Eriq La Salle of ``ER''), and attended
Colgate, where he has been a very generous alumnus. He's also
generous with his advice. He's one of many veterans providing
leadership _ former Bill Cornelius Bennett is another _ as well as
irrefutable evidence that, as Robinson says, ``Senior citizens can
play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my job,'' Robinson says. ``My job is to keep this
feeling in the air. It's the same thing that happened in Green Bay.
We had guys who knew they couldn't be beat. Guys who knew they were
good. And it rubs off on everyone. You see the guys on special
teams trying to make plays. Good things happen to teams like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who likes to talk, isn't shy on the field, either. In
the Falcons' season finale, a mauling of Miami, he got all over
cornerback Michael Booker for getting beaten on a long pass with
Atlanta leading, 21-0. Cornerback Ray Buchanan is another veteran
lured to Atlanta by Dan Reeves; he has been in the league six years
and says he loves having Robinson out there with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my (top) dog,'' Buchanan says. ``He's a quarterback on
defense, and that is really helpful to me. He puts me where I need
to be and he allows me to take chances. Just his presence alone has
been great.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson didn't miss a game this season, which isn't exactly
news. He has missed two in the last 11 years. He was part of an
Atlanta defense which set a franchise record by scoring six
touchdowns (he had one, a 25-yard interception return against New
Orleans). He had four interceptions in 1998, giving him 53 in his
career, tops among active players and 16th all-time. He ended the
season with 91 tackles, second to Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   But while Robinson prepares for his ninth playoff game, some of
his teammates, notably Chandler and Anderson, have never been in
the postseason. All that means is that Robinson's higher-profile
teammates, and anyone within earshot in the locker room, will be in
for some serious shop talk this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good,'' he says. ``I think it's happening at the
right time.''

FREE AGENTS LAW AND MILLOY MAY BREAK PATROTS' BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ One of the Patriots' many evaluations this
week involves prioritizing their free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Their seven unrestricted free agents may have to wait in line to
see how much money is left after Ty Law and Lawyer Milloy get new
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Though Law and Milloy are not free agents, the first-time Pro
Bowl defensive backs will be asking for big money. Both players'
contracts are up after next season, but the Patriots want to extend
them to avoid Curtis Martin II and III.
</P>
<P>
   Law will likely be asking for Deion Sanders money, about $5
million per year, while Milloy could wind up in the $4 million
range.
</P>
<P>
   Though the salary cap will increase, the Patriots may not have
as much money as one would think to (1) sign the rest of their free
agents; and (2) seek outside free agent help in critical areas such
as receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to come back here,'' said linebacker Todd Collins,
one of the seven. ``I've always enjoyed playing here. I like
playing for Pete (Carroll) and with the guys around here. I think
we have a good thing going when we're all healthy and playing
together. I think we're a good unit, and hopefully, they'll keep us
all together.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question Collins's value went up during his absence
because the Patriots dearly missed him in the last two games.
Collins, 30, first pulled a groin muscle and then a pectoral
muscle, forcing him to miss five games in all.
</P>
<P>
   Another key unrestricted player is defensive tackle Henry
Thomas, who has been told he'd be welcome back but that the team
needs to see what is left after the Law and Milloy negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas often acts as a coach on the field. Though he played most
of the season with an injured ankle, the Patriots feel they need
his presence.
</P>
<P>
   Punter Tom Tupa's future is up in the air after contract talks
were delayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing going on right now, so I have no idea what's
going to happen,'' said Tupa. ``It's been a fun three years around
here. I've enjoyed it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tupa, a Cleveland area resident, is sure to attract some
interest from the expansion Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Wohlabaugh will be in a good position in the offseason
because centers are so valuable. He had perhaps the best season of
all the offensive linemen despite playing a month with a cast on
his broken left hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You leave a little bit uneasy because you don't know what's
going to happen and where you might be,'' said Wohlabaugh. ``I'd
love to return here. I think this is a year where we learned a lot
about ourselves. We played with great adversity with the injuries
we had and we still made the playoffs. I think that's something
positive we can build on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to come back and play for Pete. I think he deserves
to be here again with a healthy group of players. We can win with
Pete. There's no question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Also up in the air are the futures of quarterback Scott Zolak
and special-teams cover man Larry Whigham.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak went 1-2 in his three starts down the stretch, the lone
win clinching a playoff spot. The Patriots must decide whether
Zolak is a capable backup for Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   They may stick with Zolak if his demands aren't much higher than
his current salary of $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   Whigham is a high-energy player who would attract some interest
in the open market. The Patriots would like to keep Whigham, who
two years ago went to the Pro Bowl, but they aren't confident in
him as a safety, and that might weigh heavily in their thinking.
</P>
<P>
   It appears they will let defensive tackle Mark Wheeler go,
feeling that second-year man Brandon Mitchell is ready to take his
spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots don't face a major dilemma with their restricted
free agents, as they did a year ago with Martin. Linebacker Tedy
Bruschi leads a list of six which also includes kicker Adam
Vinatieri, guard Heath Irwin, defensive end Chris Sullivan, tight
end Lovett Purnell, and defensive tackle Devin Wyman.
</P>

SETTLEMENT WAS WORST OF ALL SCENARIOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA is back. Damn.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the news of the collapse of the players union's
dearest-held positions is there for all to see. Having faced the
owners at their most potentially self-destructive, the union's de
facto power structure caved, and there is no other way to look at
it.
</P>
<P>
   And too bad for that, too. Not because the players were on the
side of God here. God, who didn't get to be God by being a fool,
took a pass on the whole sordid and unnecessary mess.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is a bad thing because it means that the NBA is back _
a truncated, cheapened NBA trying to pass off 52 games as a
legitimate endurance test, and having the full set of 16-team
playoffs with any number of teams at half- or less-than-half
strength because so many players won't be in playing shape, or even
close to it.
</P>
<P>
   Or did you miss Shawn Kemp at the players' charity game last
month? He looked like a sportswriter _ the kind of sportswriter who
showers in the dark while sucking in his (or her) gut so as not to
spoil the illusion.
</P>
<P>
   This is a season that quite frankly deserved to be killed
outright, not downscaled. There should have been no rewards given
to either side for playing so cavalierly with the game (as opposed
to the business, which America has demonstrated it has no use or
taste for). There should have been no money coming in, no
television time, no hint that the NBA ever existed save your
5-year-old's copy of ``Space Jam.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, there needed to be a lot more punishment than this for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   As the settlement stands now, the owners won, and won big.
Except that they deserved to lose, and lose big _ not to the
players, mind you, but to the market. They made it clear that
basketball is just a product to them, that the ebb and flow and
glories and agonies of every season comes way down the list of
their interests, just after controlling the office supplies costs.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this is a surprise, necessarily. Owners have always
been this way. It's just unsightly to have that central truth
dragged in front of our faces every night _ ``You may be fans, but
you're just suckers to us.''
</P>
<P>
   And the players surely didn't deserve to get to return to work
and collect 63 percent of their salaries. Better that they earned
nothing at all, all the more time to rue their obviously incomplete
understanding of how unions work.
</P>
<P>
   Had they but asked Don Fehr and Gene Orza, the baseball players
union wise guys, they would have learned that unions have value
only when all the workers are standing on the same set of
principles, and are letting the representatives they hired and pay
do the negotiating. In this case, Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Now maybe Hunter was a good union rep. Or maybe he wasn't. What
was plain was, he wasn't in charge of his membership. The heavy
hitters were operating at the behest of their agents, most notably
David Falk and Arn Tellem; the rank and file were presumably being
represented by Hunter, but Hunter needed the stars to bring before
the owners or be laughed out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   To put it another way, if the players wanted David Falk to run
their union for them, they should have elected David Falk. And if
Falk didn't want to run their union for them, he should never have
been in on the decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   To put it yet another way, the players had all the unity of
purpose of the Republican caucus, and the same sense of public
relations. They couldn't explain at any point why their arguments
for the status quo carried any weight, which is amazing given the
hilarious owners' stance on the number of teams losing money and
the league's tenuous financial position.
</P>
<P>
   That was killing. Because they couldn't explain themselves, they
couldn't rally public interest, let alone support, they couldn't
make the owners think twice about burning the season to the ground.
That they tried to claim a draw Wednesday after Hunter and Stern
cobbled out their agreement is just posturing. They lost. So did
the owners, although not nearly as much. So did we all.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is, we got punished plenty, just by watching this
ridiculous tableau for so long. The players and owners weren't
punished enough _ not enough lost revenue, not enough public scorn.
Not enough shame for not doing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Damn.

NEW YORK FANS SHOW THEY REALLY CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was easy to say a couple of days ago. That's when
NBA players and owners were still fighting in their lockout haze. I
convinced myself then that when they finally came out of it,
players and owners would be greeted by echoes bouncing off empty
seats and arena walls. And then I came here.
</P>
<P>
   I could tell you that I had my fingers crossed when I said
people don't care about the NBA. Or that I meant it when I said it.
Or that I reserve the right to change my mind. Or that people still
don't care, it just depends on how you define ``care.'' But here's
the truth: I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   That became obvious to me as soon as I walked inside a building
on the corner of 59th Street and 5th Avenue Wednesday. It was even
more clear when I walked through that building and stepped outside
onto Madison Avenue. So now I realize that those were really not
the sounds of indifference you heard the past six months during the
lockout. No, those were the sounds of proud fans, trying to smother
the wails of their hearts. They freed the wails Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   I still can't believe I saw this: Jermaine O'Neal was surrounded
by a crowd of reporters and autograph-seekers while Donald Trump
walked through the General Motors Building without much of a stir.
There are not many interesting things about Jermaine O'Neal's game.
He is quickly recognizable simply because he is a near 7-footer.
But he is an NBA player. If you were looking for angry fans spewing
irreverent lockout references, you were in the wrong city. And, I
presume, the wrong country. All NBA players here were heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Corie Blount had to fight through the crowd. So did Danny
Schayes. O'Neal's contingent got so large that the Portland Trail
Blazer wound up shutting down a revolving door because he happened
to be standing in front of it when armies of cameras came his way.
I'm not just talking about the cameras of CNN and ESPN and CBS.
There were fans wielding pens, cameras, and camcorders. And
whenever someone wants to make the 21st-century video version of
``We Are The World,'' that person should gather up the types who
were assembled here. There were children, college students, the
business set, the hiphop set, the groupie set, the elderly set, and
the former celebrity set.
</P>
<P>
   All of them frustrated several security guards, who begged for
order. No chance of that. Elevator doors would open and players
would walk into cheering and chanting crowds. None of this was
expected at the beginning of the day. Two reporters departed Boston
for here Wednesday morning and found themselves on the same plane
as former Boston College star Billy Curley. They shared a cab with
him into the city and picked up the tab, telling him he could use
the break because he was out of work. By the end of the day, they
wouldn't have been able to have a quiet conversation with Curley.
There was no quiet. Curley and every other NBA player had been
transformed from the damned to the revered in the time it takes to
announce, ``NBA players and owners have reached an agreement . . .
''
</P>
<P>
   I still believe that this game is hurting. It has expanded too
much. It will soon lose its best player, Michael Jordan, to
retirement. It still has too many 84-75 games in its system. But I
cannot ignore the scenes of Wednesday. It is easy for me to sit
one-on-one with a keyboard and reminisce about the days when I
wanted to wear No. 6 because Dr. J wore it. Or wanted to find a
9-foot rim and practice a dunk I saw the Doctor perfect while I was
watching grainy ABA footage. I also wore canvas Chuck Taylor
sneakers and pulled my socks up to my knees, just like Julius
Erving.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a different NBA. We have to acknowledge that. This
is the NBA where players are just as likely to make appearances on
MTV and BET as they are on ESPN. When these players go away, many
of their fans do not necessarily long for seeing the game; they'd
just like to see their celebrities in action.
</P>
<P>
   And if you consider yourself a true fan, be honest and answer
this question: Did you think of personnel moves when you heard the
lockout was over? Did you allow yourself to think of what draft
picks will help what teams; what teams are early championship
favorites; what trades would make the most sense?
</P>
<P>
   We cannot deny that the game needs repair. But to say people
don't care is not telling the truth. When Patrick Ewing finally
descended from a conference room Wednesday, a pro-Knicks crowd
began to surround him. The New York center was not very happy about
the deal his union agreed to. There were whispers that the players
were prepared to cave in and play ball, vote or no vote. Ewing
probably wanted to scowl. But there were shouts of ``Win the
championship, Patrick'' and ``Beat the Bulls.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing talked for a while. And then he walked onto Madison
Avenue, got into a black limousine, and tried to close the door. He
nearly slammed a person in the door because people were trying to
get into the car with him. One person was nearly run over by the
limo.
</P>
<P>
   Do people care? I think the question is rhetorical.

WHO WILL PAY FOR A TAX CUT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At nearly 20 months of age, Ilana Blumsack is a few steps behind
her peers _ literally. Like many babies born prematurely, her motor
skills have developed slowly, though she is now on the verge of
walking. A regular exercise and therapy regimen has helped Ilana
learn to crawl and move around, skills most babies perform
instinctively. It took such intervention to teach her simply to
roll over.
</P>
<P>
   Ilana's progress has been aided immeasurably by the physical and
occupational therapy she has received at Cambridge-Somerville Early
Intervention, one of 65 agencies statewide that provide an array of
critically important programs for infants and toddlers struggling
with physical and emotional problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine her not going through this program,'' her
mother, Deborah Miller of Cambridge, said Wednesday. ``Most kids
don't need to be taught these things, but preemies need to be shown
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most social services, those providing early intervention
depend on state government for much of their funding. And with the
state awash in money, they believe they could do more if they had
more.
</P>
<P>
   And they could have more: Governor Paul Cellucci has more money
than he knows how to spend, a single-year budget surplus that could
easily exceed $1 billion by July 1. Yet he did not even wait for
his inauguration to renew his call for a major tax cut _ just
months after the governor and a complicit Legislature passed the
biggest tax cut in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Early childhood programs are not unique among social service
providers who have continually been asked to do more with less,
even as many other boats seem to have risen with the surging
Massachusetts economic tide.
</P>
<P>
   But early childhood program budgets give new meaning to the term
shoestring: The 65 agencies that provide these services divide
about $25 million a year from the state, a figure that has grown
less than 5 percent in the past eight years _ a period in which
overall state spending has grown 47 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Private insurance covers some costs, but only up to $3,200 a
year, far less then the costs of providing many services. Medicaid
and the state make up the rest. State law requires that some
services be provided, but inevitably, budget limitations force
providers to make hard choices every day about what they can and
cannot provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to say I make business decisions,'' said Miriam
Lasher, the director of Cambridge-Somerville Early Intervention.
``But that's what they amount to sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to twice-weekly sessions with children, the agency
also conducts home visits and does family counseling, runs support
groups for parents, and generally helps families learn to cope with
children with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech
therapists who work for Lasher's agency make an average of about
$30,000 a year _ up to $10,000 less than they would earn in private
hospitals. Most of her employees have not had raises in three
years, though for some it has been longer.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Lasher what her program could do with more money and you get
a quick list: Give her staff raises, hire more staff and extend
outreach programs in the community so disabled children could spend
less time in isolation and lead more normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an issue of holding the line on taxes. It's a question,
rather, of whether Cellucci believes government should do more for
the people it serves than simply cut taxes, and whether the
Democrat-dominated Legislature can recall the party's first
principles. For Debbie Miller and parents like her, early
intervention programs have helped their children adjust to what
will always be a challenging world.
</P>
<P>
   Ilana is but one of many infants who need aggressive
intervention. For instance, Benjamin Colen of Cambridge just
celebrated his first birthday. But while children his age are
putting blocks into buckets, or taking them out, he plays like a
child several months younger.
</P>
<P>
   Afflicted with Down syndrome, he is already beginning to show
the signs of delayed language skills the disease will cause. His
mother, Hope Colen, has already begun to study sign language,
anticipating the day her son will struggle to speak and find
himself unable to.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, having Ilana and Benjamin _ and the thousands of
children like them _ reach their full potential is as valuable as
one more tax cut. Fiscal discipline is fine. But there is no reason
it need come at the expense of needy children. Just ask the parents
of any developmentally disabled child.
</P>

BUSING'S LEGACY: RACIAL ISOLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; (Second of two parts)
</P>
<P>
   On the Tuesday before Christmas, Billy Niedzwiecki was jumped by
three schoolmates in a bathroom at South Boston High School. They
stomped on him, broke his glasses, ripped a gold chain from his
neck, and stabbed him five times. So severe was the attack that
Billy has had to undergo surgery twice at Boston Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Police were quick to deny that race played a role in the
stabbing _ even though Billy, a South Boston native, is white and
his attackers, who come from other neighborhoods, are black. Maybe
the police are right, but no one would be surprised to learn
otherwise. South Boston High has simmered with violence and racial
uneasiness ever since 1974, when Judge W. Arthur Garrity ordered
the School Department to forcibly intermingle black kids from
Roxbury and white kids from South Boston. Busing put public schools
like Southie High under a sort of martial law, with hundreds of
state troopers patrolling the corridors, snipers posted on the
roof, and metal detectors at the doors.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter-century since busing began, South Boston High
School has erupted several times in racial brawls. In 1993,
hundreds of students, black and white, hurled rocks, punches, and
racist slurs at one another. Five people ended up in the hospital,
including two police officers and the mayor. To this day, police
still patrol the grounds of South Boston High. There are still
metal detectors at the entrance. Judge Garrity's legacy endures.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind forced busing, in Boston and elsewhere, was that
black schoolchildren suffered psychological harm from the stigma of
segregation. Separating black students ``from others of similar age
and qualifications solely because of their race,'' Chief Justice
Earl Warren wrote in Brown v. Board of Education, ``generates a
feeling of inferiority as to their status . . . that may affect
their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.''
Therefore it was essential _ so federal judges would reason in case
after case _ for schools to be racially ``balanced.'' By force, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But racial balance was the one thing busing could never
accomplish. Across the country, in cities as different as Boston,
Denver, and Detroit, parents refused to stand by while their
children were yanked to unfamiliar parts of town and experimented
on in the name of ``equality.'' Those who could afford to pay
tuition moved their kids to private or parochial schools. Others
left the cities altogether.
</P>
<P>
   When Garrity's order first set the buses rolling in Boston,
85,000 students of all races attended the city's public schools. A
decade later, enrollment had shrunk to 60,000. ``White flight'' had
begun even before the judge usurped control of the schools, but
busing accelerated it sharply. In 1970, there were 62,000 white
children in Boston's schools _ 64 percent of the total. By 1980,
the number had dropped to 24,000, a little more than 35 percent of
the total. By 1990, the white headcount was down to 13,500, or 22
percent. Today whites account for just 17 percent of Boston's
public school students, and most of them attend one of the three
exam schools, where admission is based partly on merit.
</P>
<P>
   In short, busing didn't end segregation _ it worsened it. The
whole purpose of uprooting kids from schools close to home and
sending them on long bus rides to neighborhoods they didn't know
was to increase interracial exposure. That was precisely the
outcome Garrity's orders sabotaged. Before busing began, the
average black child in Boston attended a school that was 24 percent
white. Now the proportion is 17 percent. All that anguish, all that
upheaval _ and the schools are more racially isolated than ever.
</P>
<P>
   And all that money. Busing has cost Boston hundreds of millions
of dollars _ a scandalous waste of funds that could have done so
much good had Garrity and his supporters been less obsessed with
skin color and more concerned with the quality of the schools. What
black schoolchildren urgently needed in the 1970s was not
classrooms with more white faces. It was classrooms with more and
better teaching.
</P>
<P>
   They still need it. Boston's public schools are among the worst
in Massachusetts, far below the national average. Statewide test
scores released last month show that half the city's fourth-graders
can't read and two-thirds of its eighth- and 10th-graders can't do
math. In 1998, the average Boston student scored 843 on his SATs _
168 points below the national average of 1,011. ``It is a cruel
irony,'' writes Steven F. Wilson in ``Reinventing the Schools,''
his impressive 1992 book on public education in Boston, ``that some
of the finest universities in the world surround one of the
nation's least distinguished school systems.'' This, too, is
Garrity's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Busing shredded the emotional bonds that once linked the schools
to the neighborhoods that surrounded them. Far from improving the
schools, busing eroded the community support that had nurtured
them. As pride and affection evaporated, they were replaced with
resentment and alienation. Learning and school spirit dwindled in
tandem. Middle-class parents left. What remains, Wilson observes,
``is a system of educational apartheid, in which primarily
low-income children of color are consigned to a second-rate
education, one that offers grim prospects for their future.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the sort of system, in other words, that busing was
supposed to cure.

DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR PRE-TEEN PARTIES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did your preteen get invited to a New Year's Eve party? Not an
all-girl or all-boy sleepover, but a boy-girl dress-up party with
music and dancing and who knows what else? Or was there a party to
which your child didn't get invited?
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the social life of the 10- to 12-year-old, no
parent has it easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The variability in kids this age is enormous,'' says child
psychiatrist Stanley Greenspan of George Washington University. At
one end of the scale are children with surging hormones and a
budding curiosity about the opposite sex. At the other end,
children are oblivious.
</P>
<P>
   If she could choose how her child would be, preteen researcher
Margaret Sagarese would go for oblivious. ``The worst that happens
is hurt feelings and a new set of friends,'' she says. For the
precocious child, there can be dire consequences: The National
Center for Health Statistics estimates that 3.2 of every 1,000
girls aged 10 to 14 gets pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, when a child is oblivious, parents can
inadvertently be the cause of a problem. ``If you weren't popular
in high school, your buttons may get pushed,'' says Sagarese. ``You
say things like, `All your friends are going to the party, don't
you want to go?' '' Sagarese is co-author of ``The Roller Coaster
Years'' (Broadway Books), a book on middle-school children.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't high school, though, and at this age, not being
social in a boy-girl way is not a stigma or a popularity issue. Not
only do these parents end up pushing a child into situations
prematurely, but they also send a message that can have deleterious
effects by the time he is in high school: that you should do
something just because everyone else is doing it.
</P>
<P>
   If your child isn't invited to an event and doesn't care, or is
invited but doesn't want to go, Sagarese tells parents to back off
and not worry. If a child is upset she isn't included, trying to
make her feel better _ ``Who cares about that stupid party,
anyway?'' _ will only make her think you don't understand. Instead,
validate her feelings _ ``It's hard not to be included.'' If
friendships begin to shift and a child is hurt, be honest: ``It
seems like your interests aren't the same anymore. She's interested
in boys, you're not. That happens sometimes to friends. It's hard,
but you can still have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   For the parent whose child is socially active, the concerns are
very different.
</P>
<P>
   ``To assume this is innocent is a mistake,'' says Joan Lipsitz,
founder of the Center for Early Adolescence at the University of
North Carolina and a middle-school consultant.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't a given that a 10- to 12-year-old who wants to spend
time with an opposite-sex peer is experiencing sexual feelings.
``More typically, it's a kind of playacting. They're trying on what
they see older kids doing,'' says Greenspan, who is author of
``Playground Politics'' (Addison Wesley).
</P>
<P>
   But it is likely this girl or boy is wondering, ``Am I lovable?
Am I attractive? Am I masculine/feminine?''
</P>
<P>
   Once they get a ``yes'' from one person, Sagarese says, they
tend to move on to someone else to test it out again. The child who
is stuck on one peer for weeks or months _ parents might call it a
crush _ or who pushes on a regular basis for activities that have a
dating patina _ going to the movies or the mall or buying him or
her presents _ may be at risk for unsafe behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just an issue of age but also of judgment. ``They can
be so mindless,'' says John Serino, principal of the Belmonte
Middle School in Saugus, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps children safe, say Serino and others, is structure
and supervision. Parents can't be wimps about either. When we are,
we become what Serino calls ``enablers'': ``Every time you allow
your kid to do something with a mature social concept, you enable
him to grow up too fast. That's risky.''
</P>
<P>
   Serino believes this so strongly that he did away with dances at
his school, and only grudgingly allows an end-of-the-year social
from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. (anything later is too adult-like). He won't
even allow a local church to advertise dances at the school, even
though the dances are only for grades 6 to 8.
</P>
<P>
   Sagarese wishes parents were as vigilant. ``When you just let
things happen because you don't know what to do or you're afraid of
embarrassing your child, even if kids aren't doing or thinking
anything sexual, they are getting a message that going down this
path is what they should be doing. You are saying, `This
quasi-romantic, quasi-sexual path is for you. I approve.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' she continues. ``It's a path that leads
someplace. If they're slow-dancing in fifth grade, don't kid
yourself about what happens in seventh.''
</P>
<P>
   Her research shows that what happens in seventh is oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids were raised knowing about AIDS, so they've seized
on oral sex as a compromise,'' she says. ``They see it as safe and
casual.'' Although AIDS is unlikely to be an issue at age 10 or 11,
it is not unheard of, and she says the HIV virus can be transmitted
through oral sex if there's a sore in the mouth such as the kind
children develop from braces.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lipsitz and Sagarese agree it's hard to stop a child
who is intent on physical intimacy, vigilance can reduce the
likelihood of risky behavior (see accompanying box). One piece of
good news Lipsitz offers is that even if an 11-year-old does
something like kiss, it doesn't mean this will become a regular
activity. ``Kids do a lot of things one time and then not again for
a very long time,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   So your 12-year-old daughter has invited two boys over and they
want to go to her room and close the door. What do you do?
</P>
<P>
   Be respectful but firm, says Greenspan. ``Ask, `What is it you
want to do that you need the door shut?' They want `privacy' or
they want to turn up the music really loud? `That's fine,' tell
them. `You can do that with the door open.' '' Your child will
probably balk. Don't get into negotiations; stand firm. Similarly,
fifth or sixth graders may push to go to the mall or movies to hang
out. Make sure they have a plan for the mall, arrange to meet them
at a restaurant; at the movies, go along but give them breathing
space, say, by sitting six rows behind them. Just dropping them off
at either venue becomes the enabling behavior Serino talks about.
</P>
<P>
   At a party, Sagarese says supervision means being in and out of
the room, refilling snacks and drinks, but not standing guard.
Before you agree to host a party, spell this out to your child.
Tell him, ``This is my job as a parent.'' If he says friends won't
like it, a good response is ``If they don't understand, they aren't
good friends to have.''
</P>
<P>
   A parent's worst fantasy, of course, is walking in on something
inappropriate. Ever hear of a game called Lemon? Sagarese says it's
popular among 11-year-olds in some parts of the country.
Participants write names of body parts on scraps of paper, then
take turns picking the papers at random and describing whether they
would like to lick, touch, or just look at the body part. She knows
one parent who walked in on the game and then walked back out
again, flabbergasted but paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of makes you long for `Spin the Bottle,' '' says
Sagarese.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Serino would tell a parent in that situation to do:
``Say to the group, `This is not a game for kids your age,' or pull
your child aside and give him the option of stopping it before you
do.'' Doing anything less, he says, surrenders moral leadership.
</P>
<P>
   If you know for a fact, either from observation or overheard
conversations, that your child is sexually curious, ``I'd be having
lots of conversations,'' says Sagarese. There are no magic words,
but the main message to get across is that sex is a wonderful
thing, ``but you're too young for anything but kissing.' '' Set up
the idea that sex happens in stages; otherwise, she says, kids go
to intercourse at 14.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, shift your child's focus from sex to
personality traits: ``David makes you feel special, doesn't he?
What is it about him that you like so much?'' ``Is Jenny someone
who could keep a secret? Loyalty is a trait I admire in a person.''
</P>
<P>
   The more children this age do things in groups, the better, says
Lipsitz. Don't worry if the group is lopsided, three girls and two
boys or even three and one. ``That's a pal group,'' she says. But
consider it a red flag if it's consistently two and two, especially
if one ``couple'' stays the same. ``That smacks of romantic
overtones for somebody,'' she says, and is what can lead to
experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   Sagarese says a parent's goal isn't to stop feelings but to
guide them. ``Kids need help to understand what their emotions are
all about and to act on them in appropriate ways. If you fall down
doing that, what they do at 10 and 11 ends up as practice for what
they will do at 13 and 14.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --In the lingo of preteens, ``going out'' means talking on the
phone and walking together to classes. ``Dating'' means going to
the movies or the mall.
</P>
<P>
   --Clues that your child is curious about sex: magazines she
reads; phone calls to peers of the opposite sex; conversations
about the opposite sex; interest in activities that look like
dates.
</P>
<P>
   --Children with older siblings are more likely to engage the
opposite sex at a young age.
</P>
<P>
   --Keep socialization to age-mates. In these years, there are big
developmental differences between children only two years apart.
Even hanging out with the friends of a slightly older sibling can
expose a 10- to 12-year-old to risky behavior.
</P>
<P>
   --Get together with parents of your children's friends. The more
consistent you all are in setting limits, the more likely it is
that parents, not children, will set behavior standards.
</P>
<P>
   --Don't be embarrassed or intimidated to call a child's parents
to ask about supervision at their house.

YOU'RE NOT THROUGH YET: 6 MORE RESOLUTIONS TO KEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PART II)
</P>
<P>
   The year has barely begun, and already how many resolutions have
you broken? Or did you make any in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   We have already mentioned six easy-to-keep resolutions, month by
month, for the first six months of the year. Well, you're not off
the hook that easily; we have the rest of the year for you, until
the ultimate year is over and we're in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   So, while we're waiting, here are those six resolutions to make
and to keep:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
July
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it nice to think of all that heat coming our way?
</P>
<P>
   Then again, there is all that heat, heating up the house and our
bodies until we just can't take it any more.
</P>
<P>
   So, do something about that heat. Not all of us have air
conditioning, which is expensive, but there's another way to beat
the heat, and it is inexpensive. Ventilation is the way.
</P>
<P>
   A few well-placed window fans can pull a lot of heat out of the
house, but you have to know when to use such fans. That is at
night, when the outside temp is lower than the inside temp.
</P>
<P>
   Two window fans, one for the first floor and one for the second,
can bring the temperature down 10 or 20 degrees overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Floor fans, the old-fashioned oscillating ones in modern dress,
can move air nicely, either outdoors or over our hot, sweaty
bodies, making the heat more bearable.
</P>
<P>
   There are even personal fans, little tiny things like computer
fans, that blow a breeze right in your kisser.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; August &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Take a break. Go away. It's the traditional time for vacations,
and going any place will give much-needed relief from those darned
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   If you do stay home, spend some of those days fighting mildew,
the black stuff that forms outdoors on shingles, clapboards, and
other siding, on roofs, decks, and patios. Yes, we know that mildew
is old hat, but it is still round and needs looking after.
</P>
<P>
   Use the universal mildew killer, a mix of bleach and water. Make
it strong (one part bleach to three parts water) or weak (five to
10 parts water to each part bleach). Paint that mixture on the
black spots.
</P>
<P>
   If the spots are mildew, they will disappear in five to 10
seconds. If the weak solution does no good, make it stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Those black stains not only look bad but, left in place, they
can cause decay of wood, asphalt shingles, paint, stain, and any
other organic material.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; September
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In July, it was ventilate, ventilate, ventilate. In September,
it is insulate, insulate, insulate.
</P>
<P>
   Some houses, surprisingly in this day and age, are not insulated
at all. If yours is not, it is easy to start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   First, insulate the attic floor. If there are no floorboards,
simply insert fiberglass with a paper (vapor barrier) backing
touching the ceiling below, between the joists. Always put the
vapor barrier toward the heated part of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Six-inch-thick insulation is good, but eight, 10, or 12 inches
is even better.
</P>
<P>
   If the floor has boards on it, you can't easily slip insulation
under them except by having it blown into place. No matter what
insulation you use, do not put any in the eaves, the roof overhang.
</P>
<P>
   Second place to install insulation is the basement ceiling. Use
six- or eight-inch fiberglass with the paper backing up, against
the ceiling above. Hold the insulation in place with insulation
hangers, pointed wires pushed up between the joists, spaced every
24 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Third place for insulation is the walls, best done by blowing
cellulose or fiberglass in the wall cavity. You will save a big
portion (up to 30 percent) of your heating bill with these simple
steps.
</P>
<P>
   If you already have insulation, there is at least one place you
can add to it: the attic floor.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; October
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wash the windows, inside and out.
</P>
<P>
   All you need is a solution of water with a dash of ammonia, a
sponge, lots and lots of paper towels, and a squeegee.
</P>
<P>
   Wash with the solution, squeegee the window dry without streaks,
and wipe the squeegee dry with towels between strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Clean windows will sparkle in the autumn light, let in more
light and more solar heat.
</P>
<P>
   One homeowner told us that he takes off his screens as well, and
remarks on how much lighter it is in the house. That is a good
idea, too, but be darned sure you mark where those screens go; if
you mix them up, you will spend all next spring and summer trying
to sort them out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; November &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the good old days, November was the month of the aroma of
burning leaves. Remember how good they smelled? But it also
polluted everything in sight.
</P>
<P>
   We can't do that anymore, but you can grind up the leaves with
your mulching mower or, a better toy, a chipper-shredder, and
spread them on your lawn and garden beds. By spring, they wil be
part of the garden soil.
</P>
<P>
   While you're at it, order four or fives yards of cow manure. You
can get it well rotted (it does not smell so awful) and you can
spread it on the garden to joint the shredded leaves.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; December &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a final resolution we'd all like to keep.
</P>
<P>
   Buy all your presents, wrap them, and send them out to all those
deserving them, get the cards out, and the decorations and lights
up, all by Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought all these resolutions were practical!
</P>
<P>
   Happy New Year, anyway.

ETIQUETTE IN THE FACE OF A LIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A woman smiled in my direction across a crowded produce aisle. I
didn't know her, so I assumed she must be smiling at someone else.
Then she came over to say hello. I knew her all right, but I hadn't
recognized her. She'd had something done to her face _ several
things, I'd guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look wonderful,'' I said, and immediately regretted saying
it. Not because it wasn't true. She looked great, although she did
look like somebody other than her old self. Somehow I had the
feeling I'd stuck my foot in my mouth. She said she'd just returned
from a month's vacation in California, then changed the subject. I
felt like saying, ``Wow, that must have been some vacation.'' But
clearly, she didn't want to talk about her transformation.
</P>
<P>
   What's cosmetic surgery etiquette? Is it rude to notice and say
something complimentary, something that might be construed as
prying? Or is it rude not to notice, to pretend nothing looks
different after they went to all that trouble to improve their
appearance? It's a question that comes up with growing frequency,
as the baby boom generation marches through middle age and more
people turn to cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes even close friends won't tell you. They want to
preserve the illusion that nature has miraculously turned the clock
back 10 years. If you tell the woman how good she looks, she might
put it down to a new hairdo, new makeup, new man, new ZIP code,
whatever, while you stand there staring at her new face thinking,
``Oh, come off it. What have you had done?'' There's a new openness
about cosmetic surgery, judging from the number of articles, books,
and television programs on the subject, to say nothing of the
celebrity confessions. But this new openness may just be in the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmetic surgeon Elliot Jacobs says he's noticed that people
have become more open about talking about cosmetic surgery, up to a
point. ``They'll talk about it in general, and about other people's
surgery, but they won't talk about themselves,'' he said. ``It's
almost a double standard. And of course they're glad to accept any
compliments that come their way as the result of the surgery. But
they don't want to talk about the surgery itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, whose office is in Manhattan, says his practice is
somewhat unusual in that about half his patients are men. According
to the American Academy of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgery, men now account for 28 percent of facial cosmetic surgery,
up from 15 percent 10 years ago. ``Men are every bit as vain as
women, and every bit as reticent when it comes to talking about
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for what to say to the newly transformed friend or
acquaintance, Jacobs said it shouldn't be an issue, if the surgeon
is good and the patient has realistic expectations of the surgery.
Ideally, the patient should appear refreshed, as opposed to
reconfigured.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Martin is on top of the issue, as usual. In her book
``Miss Manners' Guide for the Turn of the Millennium,'' she
responds to a reader who asks how she should react to a coworker's
nose job. Martin writes that if the woman hadn't said beforehand
that she was undergoing the procedure, it would be rude to notice
the specific change: `` . . . you should reassure her that it was
worthwhile by the general statement, `You look wonderful,'' made
while staring the lady straight in the eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   And if she did confide her intentions ahead of time? Martin
writes that ``it would be rude not to notice.'' She recommends a
compliment that emphasizes the effect, rather than the cause: ``It
makes you look so much more _ you,'' is more charming than `They
did a good job.' ''

they are driven expanded and contracted with water content. They
also loosened if they were driven into just the 3/4-inch fascia
board and not also the rafter ends. If you drive the spikes into
the rafter ends, chances are good that they will hold. Another
solution is to buy special 8-inch screws that can be driven into
the holes left by the old spikes, or into newly drilled holes in
the rafter ends. The screws come with a ferrule that fits inside
the gutter, and a special tool to drive them. They are 10 for
$12.99 in the Improvements Catalog (800-642-2112).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having a hot-air furnace installed, but the installer
said it is too small for the size of the house, and will wear out
quickly, just as the original one did. The options, he said, are to
put in a bigger furnace in the basement, or keep the smaller one in
the basement and put in another in the attic. Is this feasible?
</P>
<P>
   B.B., Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It is feasible, all right, but not practical, and I suggest
that you do not put a furnace in the attic. A bigger one in the
basement should be adequate to provide enough heat and it will last
longer than the original. After all, thousands of furnaces and
heating systems have been installed in the basements of small,
medium, and large houses with the ability to heat the entire space.
</P>
<P>
   Some large houses have been built recently with hot-air furnaces
in both basement and attic. Two furnaces work well in heating a
large house, but one in the attic can cause problems such as ice
dams, from warm roofs. The roofs are made warm because, while the
attic furnaces themselves are well insulated, the open flame of the
furnace cannot be insulated, and the heat from the flame makes the
attic and the roof warm. This encourages the development of ice
dams and resulting leaks when snow piles up on the roof and the
water backs up above the dams, even if the attic is properly
ventilated.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the handyman's opinion, no furnaces in the attic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some of the bluestone blocks I replaced in a walkway have
white chalk marks. How can I remove those marks? I tried bleach,
then detergent and water, without success.
</P>
<P>
   JIM OFRIA, Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Since chalk is made of limestone, then muriatic acid should
do it in the wink of an eye. The acid attacks the lime in chalk; it
also attacks lime in concrete, mortar, grout, and efflorescence
(white stains) on concrete foundation walls. It is used to remove
excess or spilled mortar.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the acid half and half with water and apply it with a
paintbrush, or pour it on the chalked areas. After it stops
fizzing, hose it off. When mixing acid and water, always pour the
acid into the water. And wear skin and eye protection when working
with bleach.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I plan to put a wood floor in my kitchen. Should I finish it
with water-based polyurethane varnish or oil-based?
</P>
<P>
   ED FARR, Newton Centre, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Oil-based, by all means, if you are going to do it yourself.
Three coats will do well. If you are having it done professionally,
I suggest the installers use a moisture-cured polyurethane.
</P>
<P>
   Or, buy prefinished boards, and specify that they have three or
four coats, factory applied. These boards are a little more
expensive than the bare wood, but they don't have to be sanded and
varnished.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Fran Olfe of Brookline, Mass. asked how to maintain newly
polyurethaned floors, and especially how to handle scuff marks, the
handyuman suggested dry mopping and vacuuming, with a bit of damp
mopping for stubborn spots. And for the scuff marks, light rubbing
with a soap pad or steel wool and oil.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK as far as it went, but Eileen Padua of Dorchester,
Mass. wrote to share her method, adding, ``I think this is the
third time I've told you this over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mop and Glo in the blue bottle used sparingly with a damp mop
or cloth will clean scuff marks and make minor scratches disappear.
I do it once every couple of months and have never had any
buildup,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had polyurethaned wood floors 25 years old that have
had no other treatment. I also use Mop and Glo on floors I had
sanded and polyurethaned last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Eileen Padua, for the third time. Now your tip is in
the handyman's handy-dandy file for future reference.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Our family spent a night early in December having dinner at my
younger daughter's home. Julie had worked all day and was trying to
get food on the table. Her husband arrived late because of a party
at his place of business. My grandchildren were cranky and, in my
opinion, no one was sufficiently pleased that I'd brought along a
menorah so we could all celebrate the sixth night of Hanukkah. On
top of that, some of us were heading out later in the evening to
hear a favorite band.
</P>
<P>
   I felt out of sorts, on edge with so much going on.
</P>
<P>
   So what did I do?
</P>
<P>
   I picked up the newspaper and started reading.
</P>
<P>
   This is a habit that served me well in childhood. When things
got chaotic at home _ when my mother was late and my dad was
pacing, when my mother put dinner on the table and my father
wouldn't join us, when my folks were arguing and my dad was about
to walk out the door _ I read. I read the pulp science-fiction
magazines my mother stacked in the bathroom. I read Nancy Drew
mysteries. I read Archie comic books. I read the Cheerios box on
the kitchen table, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   I tuned the bad news out.
</P>
<P>
   Reading was a terrific defense. It kept me from getting
entangled in arguments that had nothing to do with me. It was a way
to escape a situation I had no power to improve. It certainly
helped in school where I was a speed reader before that term was
even invented, and it opened up whole new worlds, offering me
perspectives on life I couldn't get at home. In retrospect, like
most of the strategies for survival we invent as children _
overeating, lying, being extra good, feeling numb, creating a
diversion, hurting yourself _ it was a creative response to a
difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean it's appropriate now.
</P>
<P>
   My parents were so caught up in their own problems that they
never objected to my burying myself in a book. My present family
notices, however. They can't get my attention. They have to work
around me. It's upsetting in the same way that knowing there's a
piece missing from a puzzle casts a pall over the whole
undertaking. Everyone becomes hyperaware of the dead spot in the
room.
</P>
<P>
   Let me make clear that no one in my family complained. They're
used to me. They let it go. I was the one who was aware of how
bizarre my behavior was, but I couldn't think of any other way to
cope.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until my friend Robin lent me her copy of David
Kundtz's book, ``Stopping: How to Be Still When You Have to Keep
Going.'' Kundtz talks about ``stillpoints,'' moments when you stop
what you're doing to check in with yourself. He suggests
establishing stillpoints at times of transition: when you're halted
at a stop sign or waiting for the microwave, brushing your teeth or
riding an elevator. In those periods between one activity and
another, you detach yourself from the frantic pace of your life and
create a moment of calm and reflection.
</P>
<P>
   Kundtz's concept of stillpoints sparked this thought: What if,
instead of running away from my anxiety, I'd created a stillpoint
for myself? Could I have found another way to handle the situation
if I'd stopped in my tracks before launching into my habitual mode
of reacting?
</P>
<P>
   I could have registered the fact that I was uncomfortable. I
could have identified what I was feeling _ left out,
underappreciated, tired. I could have thought: What do I want to
have happen in this moment? I can even imagine asking for a hug
from just about anyone, and then sitting calmly until I figured out
how to be helpful. It would have made it easier not just for the
others, but for me.
</P>
<P>
   Old habits have an unfortunate way of plunging us back into old
habitats. Every time I curl into my shell, I reaffirm on some level
that the people around me are as indifferent to my well-being as I
once felt my parents to be. Every time I resort to childhood
defenses, I re-create that world and lose sight of the fact that
I'm no longer a helpless child. By acting as if I'm being ignored,
I never notice that I'm actually needed and wanted. By replaying an
old script with its predictably depressing outcome, I never see the
situation as it really is, full of new possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Kundtz calls stillpoints ``little moments of gold that can give
brilliance and joy to otherwise dull days.'' I think of them as
brief interludes of sanity, an opportunity to escape from long-ago
defeats into a present blessedly full of promise.

STRATEGIES TO AVOID `SELLING' PARTIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The human resource manager with a large company on the
East Coast has a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Her boss likes to sponsor home parties _ to sell everything from
home decorating accessories to cooking gear _ as a way to make some
extra cash, and she leans on her subordinates to fill out the
chairs in her living room.
</P>
<P>
   It's a real drag, said the manager, who didn't want to be
identified. The ``parties'' are deadly boring and there is a lot of
pressure to buy and buy big.
</P>
<P>
   But the manager finds it's really difficult to say no. It's an
imposition to the work relationship, said the manager, who noted
bitterly that co-workers who place orders so that the boss can get
a hostess gift are treated better.
</P>
<P>
   Product parties, which are portrayed as social events, prey on
the co-worker relationship of cooperation and good will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kind of things drive me crazy,'' said the marketing
director of a large outplacement firm in Houston. ``You feel
pressured to do something that you wouldn't normally do to keep
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   She was invited along with the other women in the office to a
home makeup party. The pressure is on to go, but she plans to dig
in her heels and refuse because she doesn't use the product and has
no interest in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that hungry for free hors d'oeuvres,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WORKPLACE CONTACTS CRUCIAL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Companies that sell their wares through parties such as Mary Kay
Cosmetics, Amway and Tupperware rely on workplace relationships to
move their products.
</P>
<P>
   When someone calls and wants to have a party ``we pray they work
somewhere,'' said Therese Landry, distributor for Future Unlimited
Sales, a franchise distributor of Tupperware in Houston. She
encourages party-givers to invite their co-workers first because
that is a great way to reach a large number of people. Invitations
go out next to family, friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Landry said she and other Tupperware distributors encourage
parties at work either at lunchtime or after work. Companies
generally will allow employees to use a conference room or lunch
room as long as the party doesn't keep employees away from their
jobs beyond the lunch hour or isn't disruptive, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the party host demonstrates a couple of products,
makes a cobbler in the microwave, gives out a few door prizes and
people are out the door in 30 to 45 minutes, Landry said. At a big
company, it's not unusual to sell $600 to $800 at an at-work party,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, however, have a ``no solicitation'' rule and
forbid employees from leaning on co-workers. Other companies have a
more relaxed approach and have designated a place for employees to
post notices for sales parties or sales catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Watson Wyatt Worldwide in Houston has a bulletin board in the
lunch room for such notices, but employees can't solicit anyone on
company time, said Suzanne Cleworth-Jones, marketing coordinator.
They can approach co-workers during lunch and breaks, and
Cleworth-Jones said she doesn't know of a time when that has caused
a problem.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LAWYER SEES PROBLEMS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richard Brann, an employment lawyer at Baker &AMP; Botts in Houston,
said the supervisor who tries to coerce her subordinates to attend
an after-hours party could create a problem. Something untoward
could happen and then there would be a question of whether it was a
company-sponsored event, since the supervisor was using her
authority at work to get her subordinates to participate.
</P>
<P>
   But parties that co-workers sponsor? That happens even at Baker
&AMP; Botts, said Brann, recounting snippets of conversations about
jewelry parties that co-workers host. The parties sometimes can
cause discomfort, he said, recalling conversations with female
lawyers at his firm who feel obligated to attend makeup parties
given by their secretaries.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid that ``deer in the headlights'' look when a co-worker
invites you to a home party, practice what you'll say in advance,
recommends Lona O'Connor, author of the new book ``Top Ten Dumb
Career Mistakes and How to Avoid Them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stand in front of a mirror and practice your excuse, such as,
``I hardly ever do anything in the evenings because I have a small
child and want to spend time with her.''
</P>
<P>
   Be nice about it, but you've got to be firm and keep saying why
you can't come whenever you're asked, O'Connor said. Usually the
people who invite you to those kind of parties aren't shy about
continuing to ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done such a good job of that that no one ever invites me
to anything anymore,'' she said.

 c.1999 International Herald Tribune

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A good word on behalf of Benjamin Netanyahu? It
would be hard to find one in the Israeli press. No Israeli leader
has been so reviled by so many of his countrymen. History, however,
may prove somewhat more charitable.
</P>
<P>
   In applying parts of the Oslo accords, however partially,
reluctantly, gracelessly, he has made the more moderate half of the
Israeli right wing accessory to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he has moved the nation a good way through an
ideological minefield and exposed a latent peace consensus
embracing two-thirds of Israel's population.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly against his own instincts, he has made a future
settlement with the Palestinians a matter of pragmatic give and
take rather than a hostage to hopeless theological-historical
disputation over holy land.
</P>
<P>
   It may have required an oddity like Netanyahu to achieve this
not inconsequential step.
</P>
<P>
   When a Labor government carried out the first Oslo stages, the
country was torn by violent demonstrations culminating in the
assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Netanyahu's
concessions have evoked little more on the right than parliamentary
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu had initially opposed the Oslo peace accords. During
his election campaign he changed his tack after polls showed that
most Israelis felt otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   His narrow election victory was wrought by an alliance of
right-wing ideologues and a more moderate, largely ethnic sector of
Sephardi Jews opposed to the Labor Party, which they associate with
the Ashkenazi elite of European origin.
</P>
<P>
   But they do not oppose the peace process. They distrust Arabs
but, unlike the ideologues, accept Oslo's land-for-peace formula.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu achieved election success by fudging his rhetoric so
that ethnic supporters saw him as a tough peacemaker who would
drive a hard bargain, while the hard-liners, catching his wink,
were convinced that he had no intention of withdrawing on the West
Bank, whatever he said publicly.
</P>
<P>
   His heavy-handed maneuvering during the past two years went
beyond the bounds of clever tactics into inscrutability.
</P>
<P>
   Declarations of intent to honor Israel's Oslo commitments mixed
with acts of provocation seemingly designed to derail the peace
process have left even political allies wondering who the real
Netanyahu is. He has often seemed uncertain himself.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, his withdrawal in Hebron and his implementation of
the first of three withdrawals from West Bank rural areas
constituted a crossing of the Rubicon for the right wing. The
shining image of a Greater Israel stretching from the Mediterranean
Sea to the Jordan River was being violated, not by the left this
time but by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's claim that he is the only candidate who can
implement a peace acceptable to the nation is not altogether
exaggerated. Labor had the vision and courage to make the peace
breakthrough at Oslo, but Israel's national fiber was almost
sundered in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's aggressive rhetoric and posturing enable him to make
territorial concessions without being accused of selling out by the
moderate part of his right-wing constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-liners continue to oppose Oslo, but Netanyahu's
betrayal, as they call it, seems to have taken the fire out of
them. It has exposed them in their unyielding ideology without the
protective wrappings of the broader right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu was positioned to significantly push the peace process
forward, but his undoing was his own personality. To say that no
one in the country, particularly his own ministers, believes a word
he says may be overstatement, but not by much.
</P>
<P>
   He has thrived on attack politics, instilling a pervasive
nastiness into public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of building trust with the Palestinians as peace
partners, his attitude has been imperious and demeaning. Instead of
trying to heal Israel's internal rifts he is politically vulgar and
divisive.
</P>
<P>
   His chutzpah is boundless and without charm. His swagger and
perpetually smug expression reflect an almost adolescent need to be
perceived as a winner. ``I'm no sucker,'' is one of his favorite
phrases.
</P>
<P>
   History chooses its own instruments. Perhaps a transparent
manipulator was what Israel needed to persuade a critical portion
of the population to swallow territorial concessions. Without a
character transplant, however, Netanyahu's task would seem to be
finished. &QL;

   WHITE RIVER, Ariz. _ Now that the National Basketball
Association lockout is apparently over, the league will be
scrambling to save its season and to woo back fans. But in fact the
long layoff and, more important, the shortened season may work to
everyone's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who follows professional basketball closely knows the
season is too long, especially the regular season, which is, after
all, only a prelude to the playoffs. The playoffs are what the fans
really like.
</P>
<P>
   And they're right: the post-season has the highest quality of
play and the most competitive games. Why delay it for six months,
as the league does now? In the 1950s and '60s the regular season
lasted only 62 games, 20 fewer than are played today. And in that
era, the great Celtic teams peaked during the playoffs. When I won
my first league championship, with the Milwaukee Bucks in 1971, we
won the final game on April 30. Now the season drags into June.
</P>
<P>
   For players, the wear and tear of the season, which, if you
include preseason contests, stretches on past 100 games, is
staggering. True, basketball players don't suffer broken bones as
often as football players do. But the effect of exhaustion is
severe. It wears on the players' joints and muscles.
</P>
<P>
   It's a price every pro pays after he retires: long-term damage
to ankles, knees, backs. In May 1997, eight years after I retired,
I had bone spurs removed from my ankle. For two years I had trouble
walking. My case isn't unusual.
</P>
<P>
   A shorter season would benefit the fans too because the level of
play would improve. With fewer games in the regular season, the
playoff implications of every contest would be heightened. Teams
would also have more time to prepare in between games. In the
National Football League, a team has an entire week to prepare for
each opponent.
</P>
<P>
   For NBA teams, even one more day of practice could make a big
difference since teams now often have only a morning
``shoot-around'' before they take the court against an opponent
they haven't faced all year.
</P>
<P>
   More preparation time also improves team play, a fast
disappearing aspect of the game. Of all the sports, none rely as
much on team play as basketball does, yet many players enter the
league without understanding this. Starting in elementary school,
physical education programs are being cut, and young players are
not exposed to coaching and teaching as they were in my day. As a
result, you see kids who are tremendous athletes but are
self-taught. They try to imitate the highlight films instead of
learning how to mesh with teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics will say, ``But how can teams afford to pay the high
salaries they do unless they play as many games as possible and
fill the arena night after night?'' In fact, ticket sales aren't as
crucial as they used to be. With the flood of television revenue,
teams can sell enough subscriptions to put a better quality product
on the floor fewer nights of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It is often said that the NBA pleases its fans better than the
other sports leagues do. A shortened season would make a great
sport even better.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A good word on behalf of Benjamin Netanyahu? It
would be hard to find one in the Israeli press. No Israeli leader
has been so reviled by so many of his countrymen. History, however,
may prove somewhat more charitable.
</P>
<P>
   In applying parts of the Oslo accords, however partially,
reluctantly, gracelessly, he has made the more moderate half of the
Israeli right wing accessory to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he has moved the nation a good way through an
ideological minefield and exposed a latent peace consensus
embracing two-thirds of Israel's population.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly against his own instincts, he has made a future
settlement with the Palestinians a matter of pragmatic give and
take rather than a hostage to hopeless theological-historical
disputation over holy land.
</P>
<P>
   It may have required an oddity like Netanyahu to achieve this
not inconsequential step.
</P>
<P>
   When a Labor government carried out the first Oslo stages, the
country was torn by violent demonstrations culminating in the
assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Netanyahu's
concessions have evoked little more on the right than parliamentary
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu had initially opposed the Oslo peace accords. During
his election campaign he changed his tack after polls showed that
most Israelis felt otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   His narrow election victory was wrought by an alliance of
right-wing ideologues and a more moderate, largely ethnic sector of
Sephardi Jews opposed to the Labor Party, which they associate with
the Ashkenazi elite of European origin.
</P>
<P>
   But they do not oppose the peace process. They distrust Arabs
but, unlike the ideologues, accept Oslo's land-for-peace formula.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu achieved election success by fudging his rhetoric so
that ethnic supporters saw him as a tough peacemaker who would
drive a hard bargain, while the hard-liners, catching his wink,
were convinced that he had no intention of withdrawing on the West
Bank, whatever he said publicly.
</P>
<P>
   His heavy-handed maneuvering during the past two years went
beyond the bounds of clever tactics into inscrutability.
</P>
<P>
   Declarations of intent to honor Israel's Oslo commitments mixed
with acts of provocation seemingly designed to derail the peace
process have left even political allies wondering who the real
Netanyahu is. He has often seemed uncertain himself.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, his withdrawal in Hebron and his implementation of
the first of three withdrawals from West Bank rural areas
constituted a crossing of the Rubicon for the right wing. The
shining image of a Greater Israel stretching from the Mediterranean
Sea to the Jordan River was being violated, not by the left this
time but by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's claim that he is the only candidate who can
implement a peace acceptable to the nation is not altogether
exaggerated. Labor had the vision and courage to make the peace
breakthrough at Oslo, but Israel's national fiber was almost
sundered in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's aggressive rhetoric and posturing enable him to make
territorial concessions without being accused of selling out by the
moderate part of his right-wing constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-liners continue to oppose Oslo, but Netanyahu's
betrayal, as they call it, seems to have taken the fire out of
them. It has exposed them in their unyielding ideology without the
protective wrappings of the broader right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu was positioned to significantly push the peace process
forward, but his undoing was his own personality. To say that no
one in the country, particularly his own ministers, believes a word
he says may be overstatement, but not by much.
</P>
<P>
   He has thrived on attack politics, instilling a pervasive
nastiness into public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of building trust with the Palestinians as peace
partners, his attitude has been imperious and demeaning. Instead of
trying to heal Israel's internal rifts he is politically vulgar and
divisive.
</P>
<P>
   His chutzpah is boundless and without charm. His swagger and
perpetually smug expression reflect an almost adolescent need to be
perceived as a winner. ``I'm no sucker,'' is one of his favorite
phrases.
</P>
<P>
   History chooses its own instruments. Perhaps a transparent
manipulator was what Israel needed to persuade a critical portion
of the population to swallow territorial concessions. Without a
character transplant, however, Netanyahu's task would seem to be
finished. &QL;

   HONG KONG _ Who doubts that Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea and fellow
butchers deserve to be hanged, shot, poisoned, gassed or
electrocuted?
</P>
<P>
   And who, other than the pair's Khmer victims, has the right to
do so?
</P>
<P>
   The surrender of the pair and the confusion about what Prime
Minister Hun Sen plans to do with them has naturally aroused
anguish. Can perpetrators of mass murders escape? Is there no such
thing as genocide, no such thing as crime against humanity?
</P>
<P>
   Has the world forgotten so quickly the mass graves, the mounds
of skulls, the terror created by a bunch of pitiless semi-educated
ideologues?
</P>
<P>
   The demand that these men be surrendered to international
courts, to accept that there are some universal values that the
``international community'' must apply, is real enough. Unless
punished, the argument goes, the horror will surely be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are reasons to reject out of hand the demands
that the Khmer Rouge leaders be handed over to anyone but Khmers.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious but least weighty is that Hun Sen, although
originally one of their number, has spent more time _ some 20 years
_ and effort battling the butchers than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be likable, he may have treated efforts at democracy
in his country with a degree of contempt, he may be too close to
Vietnam for comfort. Some of his supporters have used violence to
further his cause. But no one has thrown charges of mass murder
against him.
</P>
<P>
   As elected (however imperfectly) prime minister, he has first
call on how Cambodians should deal with their former enemies
within.
</P>
<P>
   He also has to deal with the situation that in every village
there are Cambodians who, like French people during the Nazi
occupation, did the bidding of the rulers. What to do with them?
Trials in The Hague don't do much for that problem.
</P>
<P>
   How other Cambodians view the matter of Khieu Samphan and
company has yet to be played out. They may deliver their own
revenge on compatriots who caused the bloodbath. But let no one
pretend that the primary victims of the bloodletting were other
than Cambodians. This is a Khmer issue.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the little matter of who supported the Khmer Rouge
butchers after 1980. The mass graves, the slaughters of innocents,
the sheer terror of the Pol Pot era were well known to the outside
world by 1981.
</P>
<P>
   But who supported the Khmer Rouge with weapons for the next
decade? Not just Thailand and China, which had their own obvious if
ignoble reasons. It was all of (the then) ASEAN and most of the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Who voted year after year to keep Pol Pot and company seated at
the United Nations? None other than Western nations now expressing
horror that the butchers may not be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Was there talk of trials of Khmer leaders for their crimes when
the United Nations brokered the 1991 peace agreement?
</P>
<P>
   Demands for trial of the brutes seem bizarre to many in Asia who
note that no one doubts their guilt. So why a show trial? And if
they are guilty, why not execute them?
</P>
<P>
   The people pressing for trial are mostly the same who oppose the
only punishment that most Cambodians would believe fits the crime:
death.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodians, execute them if you wish, or let them live and be
hated _ perhaps a more profound punishment for these exemplars of
the banality of evil.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners, read up on your own role in Cambodia in the last 50
years and be contrite. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ The sun also sets or, to be more accurate, settees.
Ernest Hemingway, writer, brawler, boozer, outdoor man, has become
a furniture line.
</P>
<P>
   ``His fame lives on thanks to the Ernest Hemingway Collection, a
new body of licensed products embracing furniture, accessories,
gifts and textiles,'' proclaims a press release from Fashion
Licensing of America Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's president, Marla A. Metzner, is ensuring that the
Nobel Prize-winner's fame lives on in such objects as the Corrida
Sofa, the Sun Valley Cocktail Table and the Papa Hemingway Chair
and Ottoman.
</P>
<P>
   The Papa chair has a ``signature nailhead embossed with an H to
identify it as authentically Hemingway'' while the brush
metal-framed Pilar bookcase has a ``distinctive signature H and
marlin symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve licensees will release nearly 100 Hemingway home products
next month, with Thomasville Furniture in N.C. the chief player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernest Hemingway had a unique celebrity about him. He was a
very real person, not a designer, and he was bigger than life,''
says Thomasville's senior vice-president of sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was launched in October with Jack Hemingway, the
writer's oldest son, bolstering the line in the North Carolina
press. ``I think he would be pleased, but he might not say so,''
Jack told the Thomasville Times.
</P>
<P>
   In her Madison Avenue office, Metzner, svelte in a safari-style
suit, likes to use a Hemingwayesque term, ``the true gen,'' to
describe the Hemingway Collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the real thing. I love to use that because when the
property is right, when the category is right, it is a true gen, it
really does bring up all the images that are very Hemingwayesque.''
</P>
<P>
   That ottomans and slipcovers and woven chenille in wild animal
patterns could be the true gen became apparent to Metzner a couple
of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She informed the Hemingway family, whom she had represented
earlier on such minor deals as Gap and Calvin Klein ads, a limited
edition Mont Blanc pen in a box that was supposed to look like a
novel ($600, but only $325 for the rollerball), fly reels, Papa
Hemingway wire eyeglass frames made in Japan and a long-billed
fishing cap featured in the J. Peterman catalogue.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to make Hemingway a brand name by trademarking him
and then find a niche for the name, such as the burgeoning home
furnishings industry. It was Metzner who put together what she
calls the brand personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``High quality was absolutely number one. Masculine, having a
sense of the man _ passionate, enduring, international, this sense
of romance although very masculine.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity commodities are not new but the branding of the name
and its intensive merchandising is novel enough for the
grandchildren of another great writer to sign up with Metzner: She
is now at work on an F. Scott Fitzgerald line, of which only a pair
of Gatsby suspenders so far exist.
</P>
<P>
   As Thomasville's vice president explained, Hemingway was a real
person, not a designer, and so each Papa product has a biographical
bias: The furniture is inspired by four places where the writer
lived: Key West, Fla.; Havana; Kenya, and Ketchum, Idaho, where he
took his life.
</P>
<P>
   Why no Paris? ``Because we didn't want to do everything at
once,'' Metzner replied, ``just as Papa said at the end of the day
he didn't like to drain the well dry, he liked to leave a little
bit so he knew exactly where to go the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to do everything in the first line. Spain, the
Paris years and Italy _ that is all to come.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Caporetto chintz? Who knows? In the meantime, Metzner is working
on Hemingway apparel, although he was a notoriously sloppy dresser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never do a suit; that wouldn't be appropriate,''
Metzner smoothly replied. She has in mind what she calls a major
sportswear line _ ``the kind of clothes that you would see
gentlemen wear in the Hamptons on the weekend. Tweeds, leather.
Country suburban, you might call it.''
</P>
<P>
   Literary consumer goods could have a great future. Beckett trash
cans for the new big areas, the kitchen and bathroom; an O. Henry
pocket watch; a Henry James golden bowl handcrafted in Taiwan with
a built-in flaw, and for Fitzgerald a hip flask.
</P>
<P>
   There is presumably nothing against a recreational utility
vehicle with zebra-patterned seats for Papa, Metzner having so far
drawn the line only at booze and firearms.
</P>
<P>
   A few grouches have of course criticized the branding of
Hemingway, but Metzner dismisses them easily. ``The family was
really defending their family name because if they didn't do it
someone else would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the things you see, the family wouldn't have approved.
By getting them pro-active, getting trademarks, now it has to be
approved. It could have been Wal-Mart or Sloppy Joe's around the
corner without their approval, so I commend them for protecting the
family name.''
</P>
<P>
   Metzner refuses to give details of the royalty agreements that
have been signed, but 1999 should be a good year for her and the
Hemingways.
</P>
<P>
   It is the centennial of the writer's birth, which will be marked
not only by a nationwide promotion for The Ernest Hemingway
Collection, but also by the publication of an abandoned manuscript
that Hemingway's youngest son, Patrick, has completed in his
father's stead and named ``True at First Light,'' and a film by
Hemingway's granddaughter, Mariel, of his Paris memoir, ``A
Moveable Feast.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy New Year, Papa. &QL;

   GLAND, Switzerland _ What are we to make of the year that just
came to its end when we consider the state of our planet? For many,
1998 will be remembered as the year of the fires, floods and
hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people have died and catastrophic damage has been
caused by torrential rain and exceptionally violent storms.
</P>
<P>
   As for the forest fires that swept parts of Asia and Latin
America, the full extent of the destruction is only now beginning
to be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The common factor in all these disasters is the global climate.
This is particularly noticeable in the case of forests. Their
distribution has always been influenced by climatic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   During the glacial periods, which were cool and dry in the
tropics, rain forests shrank to small ``refuges.'' Often the agents
of their demise was fire.
</P>
<P>
   Moist tropical forests become prone to burning when the leaf
litter and undergrowth dries up after unusually long periods of
drought, and fire spreads from surrounding grasslands.
</P>
<P>
   Today we are again seeing the frequent incidence of long dry
seasons in the tropics. Once more, fire has begun to play a key
role in the forests. But this time it is not simply the fact that
we are confronted with climate change, and change much more rapid
than in the glacial ages because it is driven by the behavior of
humankind.
</P>
<P>
   The fires themselves are mostly man-made. They are lit to clear
trees so that land can be used for agriculture or other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   With the increasing fragmentation of forest areas as a result of
timber exploitation and clearance, fires are pushing back tropical
forest fringe in Amazonia, West Africa and Southeast Asia at
increasing speed. If that continues unchecked, the world faces
deeply alarming consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The Hadley Center for Climate Change in Berkshire, England, has
calculated with its super-computer that unless things change, parts
of the Amazon rain forest will turn into desert in the next
half-century.
</P>
<P>
   That will add to the greenhouse global warming effect that we
are now learning to fear and starting to try to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   There is a terrible irony in the center's pronouncement that in
the wake of the 1998 fires the forests have already become a net
producer of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that experts around
the world now agree must be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hopes of industrialized nations that have been
reluctant to take drastic action to cut carbon dioxide emissions is
that forests might provide a partial solution by absorbing the gas.
</P>
<P>
   Policymakers need to wake up to the fact that there is no
alternative to action that will reduce the concentrations of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they must accept that moves to stop the
destruction of forests, and to conserve and manage them
sustainably, have a role to play in controlling climate change.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of clinging to the forlorn hope that the trees will save
us, we have to help ourselves by saving the trees. &QL;

OWENS STAYS HUMBLE WITH NEW-FOUND FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SAMUEL CHI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Terrell Owens came off the field with
tears streaking down his cheeks, same as last year. But this time,
he's clutching onto the ball, not an empty feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember losing to them last year,'' Owens said. ``It's
ironic that last year I left the field crying and this year I still
left the field crying. But it was enjoyable this year, it was tears
of joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Owens and the rest of the 49ers trudged off the
Candlestick field, losing once again to the Green Bay Packers, in
the NFC Championship Game. This year, thanks to Owens' 25-yard
touchdown reception with three seconds remaining, the 49ers at last
exorcised the Packer demons and are moving on in the NFC playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And Terrell wasn't the only Owens crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first person to call was my mom,'' Owens said. ``On the
phone, I can hear, my sister was crying and my little brother was
running around the house, he was excited. (My mom) said she was so
nervous watching the game and her legs were shaking. I really made
my family happy and put my hometown on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   With or without the catch, though, Owens vows not to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I celebrated long enough and it's time to get it out of my
mind,'' he said. ``I just have to take it in stride. I feel like I
am a person who can handle it. I've been very humble about my
situation and my success. I don't feel like one play is going to
make me any different of a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens' catch brought joy to himself and the residents of
Alexander City, Ala., his native town where he still resides. His
grab of Steve Young's desperation pass will be etched forever in
49er lore.
</P>
<P>
   It's ranked as one of the most dramatic and important plays in
franchise history, being compared to Dwight Clark's ``The Catch''
in the 1982 NFC Championship Game and John Taylor's game-winner in
the 1989 Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for the adulation to grow. One of the first
people to congratulate Owens on his catch was his namesake R.C.
Owens, a former standout for the 49ers who now is the team's alumni
coordinator. Terrell Owens said he wouldn't mind if his fame would
be as enduring as that of R.C. Owens, who is still fielding
autograph requests, nearly 30 years after his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I live that long and be around to sign those, I'll be happy
to do it,'' Terrell Owens said. ``I think I can be like R.C. around
here. The alley-oop, him going up in the crowd to catch it.
Everybody remembers him.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Terrell Owens will be remembered as well,
thanks to that catch. But even before Sunday, Owens has been
getting considerable notice this season. Owens clearly emerged as
Young's go-to man in 1998 by establishing career highs of 67
receptions for 1,097 yards. He also led the team with 14
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, a third-year pro out of Tennessee-Chattanooga, didn't
mind toiling in the shadows of the great Jerry Rice, who was
returning after missing a season because of a knee injury. Owens
also was unheralded, unlike J.J. Stokes, who was a first-round
draft pick after an All-America career at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Owens just craved success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I put a lot of pressure on myself because I want to
win so bad,'' Owens said. ``It was a roller-coaster of a game.
Every one play we can win or lose a game. It came down to the last
three seconds and you just never, never give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Until he caught Young's pass, in the process absorbing vicious
hits from Pat Terrell and Darren Sharper, Owens had a game to
forget. He had caught just two passes for 58 yards and lost the
ball after one of those receptions. He had dropped four passes,
including a potential touchdown pass that he short-armed because he
lost the ball in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   But Young never for a moment lost patience or confidence in his
young wideout. With the 49ers' postseason lives on the line, Young
never hesitated to go to Owens, again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can drop five, 10 balls in a row and I don't care,'' Young
said. ``He's going to get the next one. I'm very fortunate. I got
guys who are willing to work. He was ready for the next ball. (That
he had) those drops, it never came through my mind, to be honest.''

when it opens this Sunday at Ahmanson Theater. By Reed Johnson.

BLUES-MUSIC (Los Angeles) _ We keep hearing that the blues is

this highly acclaimed film. For more than 20 years, Peter Weir,

surgeon to the stars, move back to her native Providence, R.I., to
live with her dippy sister, animal-loving father, shady brother and
the ghost of her domineering mother? By Keith Marder.

GOT THE BLUES AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; We keep hearing that the blues is making a
comeback _ but on the alternative airwaves?
</P>
<P>
   That's the radio format that has welcomed both Susan Tedeschi's
``It Hurts So Bad'' and Everlast's genre-scrambling ``What It's
Like,'' two very different numbers that owe much to the blues.
</P>
<P>
   The Tedeschi tune, from her debut, ``Just Won't Burn''
(Tone-Cool/Mercury), is a straight-ahead '50s-style roadhouse blues
while the Everlast number mixes a bluesy backbeat and rapped
socially conscious lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``My drummer brought me the song and hummed the melody and I
turned it into what it is today,'' Tedeschi said. ``I pretty much
picked the key, wrote the chords out and manipulated the melody. I
thought it would work because of the way it was recorded. We spent
a lot of time on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The track is popular at such adult alternative stations as
Channel 103.1.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Tedeschi, who recently wrapped up a tour with B.B. King
and Dr. John, didn't discover the blues until after college when
she was in her early 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends were hosting a blues jam and they'd been asking me
to sit in for years,'' she said. ``I finally did and surprised
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ex-House of Pain rapper Everlast was ready to
quit the music business entirely before his new album was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't very happy,'' he said. ``But people kept asking when
I would make another record. So, I started working just for fun. We
didn't even tell my label I was busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Everlast's ``Whitey Ford Sings the Blues'' (Tommy Boy) bridges
the gap between hip-hop and alt-rock, and includes some mellow,
funky blues numbers like the radio hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started making a hip-hop record and one night I was sitting
in my living room playing the guitar and I began playing the blues
licks that turned into `What It's Like','' said 29-year-old
Everlast, whose real name is Eric Schrody. ``Once we recorded the
song, we went to the label and said we'd have both rock and hip-hop
on the album. The record kind of made itself.''
</P>

   Schrody, who was fascinated by rap in high school and eventually
became part of Ice-T's Rhyme Syndicate, later formed the loutish

   ``The band that came together behind this is awesome,'' the
rapper said. ``I have five of the baddest cats on earth. The sound
we make is incredible. People say they expect to see me with
turntables, and while we have that, it's part of the sound. We also
have a slide player, stand-up bass and clavinet. It became fun
again.'' &QL;

BUTTERFIELD'S BRAND OF BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; They were among the greatest, if littlest known,
'60s blues bands.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about the Butterfield Blues Band, the group led by
Chicago-born harpist Paul Butterfield. The original six members of
the band made an enormous contribution to modern music, turning an
entire generation of music lovers onto the blues.
</P>
<P>
   The self-titled first Butterfield album, released in 1965, had a
huge effect on rock musicians who were used to hearing blues
covered by groups like the Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   This was authentic Chicago urban blues, and thanks to
Butterfield, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf and others began to sell a
lot more records.
</P>
<P>
   The second Butterfield album, ``East-West,'' with its extended
13-minute instrumental jazz-blues-raga fusion, had an equally large
effect on rock music that still is being felt today in such popular
young groups as Phish.
</P>
<P>
   The music found on a recent two-CD compilation of Butterfield
material, ``An Anthology: The Elektra Years,'' sounds as fresh and
vital today as when it was created more than 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield, who died of drug-related heart failure in North
Hollywood in 1987, was considered an American John Mayall, a band
leader with an ear fine-tuned for talent who gave dazzling
guitarists like the late Mike Bloomfield and Elvin Bishop an early
start.
</P>
<P>
   Personnel changes were common in the Butterfield Band, but the
material and musicianship were always tip-top, from early members
like Sam Lay, arguably Chicago's greatest shuffle drummer, to
guitarist Buzzy Feiten and alto saxophonist David Sanborn in the
final lineup.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Butterfield is one of the few harpists to have
developed a completely unique sound on the instrument. Like many
Chicago-style amplified harmonica players, he played the instrument
like a horn, tending toward single notes rather than bursts of
chords.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield's playing was always intense, subtle and powerful.
Some of his best work also can be found backing Waters on the 1969
live album ``Fathers and Sons,'' partly recorded at a Chicago blues
festival in which Bloomfield, pianist Otis Spann and Lay offer
great performances.
</P>
<P>
   Before you imagine the blues begins and ends with Stevie Ray
Vaughan, check out some of the music's very best stylists. &QL;

OTHER `TITANIC' SAILS INTO L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; The Broadway sharks started circling even before
rehearsals had begun for the musical ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, inevitably, came the flood of caustic jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic Can't Sink!'' blared one headline, referring to
alleged technical difficulties besetting the $10 million show's
three-level hydraulic set design.
</P>
<P>
   Other scribes simply ridiculed the entire notion of a Great
White Way spectacular based on the White Star Line's most famous
fiasco (``All singing, all dancing, all drowning ...'').
</P>
<P>
   And when the show finally opened in April 1997 at New York's
Lunt-Fontanne Theatre to mostly unflattering reviews, it looked as
if ``Titanic'' might turn out to be one of the worst high-tech
failures since, well, the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the negative advance buzz, Peter Stone's voice
acquires an icy edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press was very much wanting to write, `Titanic Sinks
Again,' `Titanic Hits Another Iceberg','' says the veteran writer
of ``Titanic'' and a string of other hit musicals including
``1776'' and ``The Will Rogers Follies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the headlines written because they thought it was
very unlikely, just like they did on `1776.' They didn't like us
doing it. They didn't want us to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But after ``Titanic'' had hauled away five 1997 Tony Awards,
including best musical, some of the major New York critics began
humming a different tune and upgrading their estimation of the
show, which opens Sunday at the Ahmanson Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was very, very praiseworthy that so many critics
would've (done) that,'' says Maury Yeston, ``Titanic's'' composer.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, nothing wrong with a little historical revisionism. Without
it, after all, the Titanic legend probably wouldn't continue to
fascinate us, 87 years after the great ship sank off Nova Scotia
with 1,522 lives lost.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Yeston saw the Titanic's story as being
fundamentally about three things: the nobility of human heroism and
self-sacrifice; the breakdown of faith in technological progress;
and the beginning of the upending of traditional European class
structures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ship embodied the great dreams of the people aboard,''
says Yeston, a previous Tony winner for his music and lyrics to
``Nine'' and a Tony nominee for ``Grand Hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the third class, it was a dream of a better life in the
New World. For the second class, it was the dream of a luxurious
ocean voyage so that they could imitate the lifestyle of the rich
and famous. And for the first class, of course, it was a
celebration of their complete hegemony over the world. And you
know, when that ship hit that iceberg, all those dreams crashed at
once. And the age of anxiety was born.''
</P>
<P>
   The risky idea of fusing these themes into a mass-appeal
Broadway show first occurred to Yeston a dozen years ago, when an
oceanographer's discovery of the wrecked Titanic coincided with the
Challenger space shuttle disaster a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   Both incidents, Yeston says, shook up the belief _ borne of the
Industrial Revolution _ that bigger, stronger and faster always
equals better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to realize that this is ... a central myth of the 20th
century, a myth of pride going before the fall, the myth of
overwhelming reliance on this infallible notion of technology, the
myth that we can actually dominate nature,'' Yeston says.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, he set out to concoct music that would evoke the
hubristic optimism and imperial pomp of Edwardian England. Rather
than snappy Broadway show tunes, the composer envisioned a more
operatic score that might suggest the work of such
turn-of-the-century composers as Britten, Vaughan Williams and,
especially, Elgar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was an opportunity to go to the broad symphonic music of
British imperial civilization, from Gilbert and Sullivan straight
through to the early 20th-century British symphonists, an almost
operatic musical form that was going to use musical themes as
symbols and that was going to make large references from one
section of the show to the other through music,'' Yeston explains.
</P>
<P>
   The next challenge was to express those musical ideas through a
compelling dramatic structure, one that would give ``Titanic'' the
feel of a timely fable rather than a nostalgic period piece.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Stone, whose experiences with ``1776'' and ``The Will
Rogers Follies'' made him something of a specialist in making
history sit up and talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I made the decision to do `1776,' basically it was
because I didn't know any of that history,'' Stone says. ``And I
couldn't believe it. It was incredible to me that I had gone
through school and college and graduate school and didn't know any
facts about our own national legend.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Stone says, he didn't want anything to do with a
musical about the Founding Fathers because he thought it would be
``appallingly boring.'' What changed his mind was hearing composer
Sherman Edwards' opening song, ``Sit Down, John.'' Stone caught the
song's spirit of affectionate impertinence, ``and I understood the
whole show very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic'' was an easier sell because the story of the voyage
and the sinking lent itself to a classical dramatic structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The astonishing thing about `Titanic' was that it is perfectly
suited to the stage,'' says Stone. ``It satisfies all of the
Aristotelian requirements for theater. It's in a confined place, in
a confined period of time, it has tragic heroes and tragic villains
and tragic bystanders even. It has valor, it has courage, it has
survival, it has even shameful and selfish behavior. It has
everything that one could want for a story, plus it has a terrific
second act curtain (hitting the iceberg).''
</P>
<P>
   Although the musical's outcome is never in doubt, its authors
endeavored to immerse the audience in the story so they might
temporarily forget what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Peter was a great idea for that,'' Yeston says,
``because he had done the same thing with `1776,' in which
everybody knows that we signed the Declaration of Independence, but
you'd never believe it watching that show.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the latest movie treatment of the Titanic legend, you
won't hear Stone and Yeston second-guessing James Cameron's $100
million, Oscar-winning Hollywood disaster epic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was wonderful,'' Yeston says, ``I thought it was
everything that a great, literalizing movie should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone, a successful screenwriter himself (``Sweet Charity,''
``The Taking of Pelham 1-2-3''), liked the movie, too _ except for
that minor matter of the characters played by Kate Winslet and
Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that surprised me about the film when I
finally saw it, what I didn't like about it was, with the richest,
most interesting, most absolutely compelling set of characters,
they chose to invent two kids who were not terribly interesting,''
Stone says. ``The fact that they became sex symbols and the young
girls went crazy is a good thing for the producers.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some of the musical's characters are fictional
composites, the main ones are not: the millionaire industrialists;
Ida Straus, the Macy's co-owner who chose to perish with her
husband of 40 years; Capt. E.J. Smith; conniving White Star Line
owner J. Bruce Ismay; the idealistic ship-builder Thomas Andrews;
and the dauntless wireless operator Harold Bride, who Yeston
regarded as a sort of ``introverted Internet hacker.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Stone did like about the movie were its stirring,
startlingly realistic images.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the images) have helped us on this road company,'' he
says, ``because having those images fresh in the mind of everybody,
we don't need to try so hard technically. We can be much more
impressionistic.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, ``Titanic'' is giving the impression of a show working
up a good head of steam. After Los Angeles, it sails on to Denver,
Seattle, Chicago, Boston and Washington, D.C., and probably into
the new millennium _ where someday, no doubt, more generations will
interpret the saga all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the true opening song of the show compares the
building of the Titanic to the great projects of civilization,
starting with the pyramids and the gothic cathedrals,'' Yeston
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so in many ways there's a nostalgia for that, too _ a
nostalgia for a great project, that we all strive and we believe
in, that falls. We want to build high, and we want to build
greatly. And even though we fail, that's still a very praiseworthy
aspect of what humans do _ to strive.'' &QL;

`ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE' TRACKED JUST RIGHT

SOUNDTRACK/``Another Day in Paradise'' (V2)
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter what you think of Larry Clark's new film about a
pseudo-family of junkies on the run, you'll have to agree the
producers got this soul soundtrack just right. Among the highlights
of this down-and-dirty collection are Fantastic Johnny C's
``Boogaloo Down Broadway,'' Otis Redding's ``Hard to Handle,''
Clarence Carter's ``Looking for a Fox'' and the obscure ``Soul
Sister'' from an Allen Toussaint solo album. As for more recent
material, the soundtrack doesn't disappoint, either. Expect to
place Chocolate Genius' ``Can I Change My Mind'' and N'dea
Davenport's reading of Bob Dylan's ``One More Cup of Coffee'' up
there with the rest. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BLACK CROWS/``By Your Side'' (Columbia)
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Black Crowes rebound with a streamlined, rootsy rock
'n' roll effort that should re-establish the band with longtime
fans. Still taking cues from such well-loved '70s acts as the Faces
and Humble Pie, the Crowes have come up with a strong set of songs,
including the angry ``Kicking My Heart Around,'' the sinister
``HorseHead,'' and the Stax-inflected ``Only a Fool.'' At the same
time, Chris Robinson just may be one of today's most soulful rock
singers. 3 Stars. &QL;

`PROVIDENCE' STRETCHES CREDIBILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; She helped beautify Tori Spelling, Sylvester
Stallone and a ``Baywatch'' lifeguard. She had a powerful agent for
a live-in boyfriend, a Malibu beach house and a nifty Porsche
convertible.
</P>
<P>
   So, why would Dr. Sydney Hansen, plastic surgeon to the stars,
move back to her native Providence, R.I., to live with her dippy
sister, animal-loving father, shady brother and the ghost of her
domineering mother?
</P>
<P>
   Well, we could't have this predictable, cliche-ridden, ``Touched
by an Angel'' (a show creator John Masius worked on) wanna-be if
she didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Syd's favorite parts of her visits to her family are when she
leaves. And after her sister's near nuptials, which were canceled
after her mother died during the service, she returns to the fast
lane of Pacific Coast Highway.
</P>
<P>
   Home early from work one day, Syd finds her boyfriend in the
shower with his newest male client. Repulsed by the sight, she
packs her bag and moves home, proving Thomas Wolfe wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As with most shows and movies about a big fish moving back to
its small pond, the setup is not believable. The last place you'd
expect Syd to go when she was in distress was back to the family
she generally ignored. You'd expect this ultra-successful
fat-sucker to turn to Spago for comfort and then move up the beach
to another house.
</P>
<P>
   Once back in Providence in the series' second episode, she has
to fit in with her dysfunctional clan and picks up a job at a local
clinic where medicine matters. She also happens upon her unrequited
high school love, an ex-jock who tore a rotator cuff and now drives
a limousine for a living.
</P>
<P>
   The show often pokes fun at plastic surgery as being the devil's
work.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with this show is not Melina Kanakaredes,
who plays Syd. She is certainly attractive, charming and talented
enough to carry a series.
</P>
<P>
   The most bothersome thing is that it tries to mix the cuteness
of ``Ally McBeal'' with sappy spirituality and a bickering family.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most preposterous notion of the series is that Syd's
mother comes back. She announces that she was banished to hell
(i.e. Providence) in her afterlife and appears to her daughter to
offer wise rules for living.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately not among them: moving back to L.A. &QL;

THE WEIR OF `LIVING DANGEROUSLY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When most people think about ``The Truman Show,''
which hits video stores Tuesday, they probably see the sweet, goofy
image of Jim Carrey. Although the comic actor gives a stellar
performance, don't overlook the man who directed this highly
acclaimed film.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, Peter Weir, working within and outside
of Hollywood, has made interesting, provocative and at times
brilliant movies. ``Truman,'' in many ways, brings together the
best parts of the Australian director's artistic vision.
</P>
<P>
   Weir first opened American eyes with his 1975 film ``Picnic at
Hanging Rock,'' recently released on video and DVD. The existential
mystery tells the story of the disappearance of three schoolgirls
on Valentine's Day 1900. Beneath its lyrical, pastoral images
resonates a sexual tension that gives ``Picnic'' a haunting
quality.
</P>
<P>
   There is an open-endedness to ``Picnic'' that can be seen in
``Truman.'' Yes, while the film has the requisite uplifting ending
(we're not giving anything away here), it also leaves the lingering
question of how Truman Burbank will redefine his life.
</P>
<P>
   Weir followed with another mystical thriller, ``The Last Wave''
(1977), which starred Richard Chamberlain. ``Wave'' weaves a
narrative that flows between dream sequences and natural events,
winds and raging storms. The film contrasts the western, scientific
viewpoint with a spiritual vision, in this case that of the
indigenous Aborigines of Australia. The metaphysical questions Weir
explores recur in his other films, including ``Truman.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Gallipoli'' (1981) and ``The Year of Living Dangerously''
(1983), both starring Mel Gibson, Weir used a more conventional
narrative style. Both films are immensely powerful and
thought-provoking and help set Weir apart as major filmmaker.
``Gallipoli'' is an extraordinarily moving antiwar film. It tells
the story of two runners, who first compete against each other in
track meets, and then use their speed in the trenches.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Saving Private Ryan,'' this is not a story of the
``Good War.'' The battle of Gallipoli was the disastrous invasion
of a Turkish port by Australian troops in World War I. It was a
20th-century war that used 19th-century tactics. The result was a
meat grinder. Men were pointlessly sent in Civil War-style charges
into thick machine-gun fire by clueless generals. (Remember, in
Europe troops fought over the same few miles for most of the war
until America joined the allies and helped wear down the Germans.)
</P>
<P>
   At Gallipoli, the Australian troops faced a well-armed Turkish
force that held the advantage of having heights, but the
Australians continued the assaults for three months, although the
cost in lives was devastating and they were unable to gain ground.
At its heart, ``Gallipoli'' is the story of the onslaught of
technology in the 20th century and its effect on man. While the
stunning battle scenes are devastating to watch, it is equally
devastating to watch the two runners (Mark Lee and Gibson) lose
their innocence and optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Year of Living Dangerously'' is also a clash of the old
and the new, this time in Indonesia during the 1965 attempted coup
by the communists. Linda Hunt picked up a Best Supporting Actress
Oscar for her role as Billy Kwan, the Chinese-American who shows
Gibson's character the ropes. Perhaps not entirely successful in
linking its political and psychological themes, ``Living''
nevertheless is a gripping film.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Truman,'' Weir's Hollywood films such as ``Witness,''
``Mosquito Coast'' and ``Dead Poets Society'' are worth repeated
viewing. But if you haven't yet seen some of his earlier works,
you're missing some terrific filmmaking. &QL;

SHOPPING: WHAT NOT TO BUY FOR BABY 
</HEADLINE>
  By JEFFREY GOLDBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A sort of shopping psychosis overtakes the mind of a father
fresh from the delivery room. It might be rooted in some sort of
primal hunter-gatherer-type urge, the kind that afflicts most men
when they enter a Price Club (``Of course we need 24 gallons of
WD-40, honey. You never know when they're going to stop making
it'').
</P>
<P>
   Conquer this urge, and you may graduate the first month of
parenthood without fielding a call from an American Express
security officer worried about ``unusual activity'' on your card.
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, a quick guide to what you need and what you don't.
This is, obviously, a subjective guide written by the kind of
flawed individual who actually considered buying an electric baby
wipe warmer.
</P>
<P>
   Diapers: Diaper bags are a good place to start, since they are
unnecessary: A $20 knapsack and a $2 dry-down--an absorbent,
washable pad--are perfectly sufficient substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Diapers are, however, necessary, and I would suggest as a first
step the purchase of Price Club diapers, which come in huge cartons
and cost about 25 percent less than the equivalent number of
Pampers.
</P>
<P>
   Warehouse club diapers aren't as handsome or sturdy-looking as
``premium'' or ``supreme'' diapers, but even standard diapers today
can absorb the contents of a camel's hump without leaking. Avoid
``premium'' diapers that contain emollients or aloe vera, which
don't transfer to the baby's skin. The only diaper worth paying a
premium price for is one that changes itself.
</P>
<P>
   An indispensable purchase is a Diaper Genie, a brilliant little
contraption that is a vast improvement over the open diaper pail. A
Diaper Genie (which generally sells for around $25) accepts dirty
diapers through a hole on top, and with a few twists of a canister,
seals the diapers in plastic and eliminates most of the smell. It
does not provide Level 4 biohazard containment--ignore the
optimistic ``odor-free'' claim made on the box--but it will do in
most cases.
</P>
<P>
   Car safety: On issues of child safety, I take the SDI position,
which is to say, there is no such thing as too much defense
spending. A maximalist position on safety means only one car seat
will do, the Britax. It is more expensive than the run-of-the-mill
Century line of car seats (a Britax runs above $200), but it is
made of material so hard it would crack your knee if you walked
into it, and its belting system is far more encompassing and
elaborate than the average car seat's.
</P>
<P>
   Home safety: Every baby superstore features a section that could
be called the Wall of Death. At Buy Buy Baby, the suburban
Washington store with which I'm most familiar, the Wall of Death
rises 16 feet into the air and stretches 10 feet wide, and every
inch of the wall is covered with child safety products, some of
which are absolutely useless and most of which I have bought. (I
haven't got around to installing the toilet lid locks yet.)
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, outlet guards and rubber padding for low furniture
(the ``Coffee Tables of Death,'' with which most parents are
familiar) are necessary, but the Wall of Death preys on parental
fear. Hence, a product called ``fireplace gas valve safety
covers,'' whose purpose was too obscure for me to understand, and
the VCR Lock, which, according to the packaging, ``prevents child
from inserting objects into cassette opening.'' Another way to
prevent a deadly epidemic of object insertions is to move the VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the best way to keep a child from drowning in the
toilet is to keep an eye on the child or the toilet--excessive
reliance on safety products tends toward lower vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the baby monitors, arguably a necessity if you
live in a big house and can't hear the baby crying in her room--and
also a necessity if you're interested in intercepting police
transmissions--but is the Child View Monitor and Television, for
$149.99, really necessary? You can't even use it to spy on a nanny,
since it has no hidden camera capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Breast pumps: Ask someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Cribs: You can spend $500 (or $1,000) on a crib, or you can
spend $200. Spend $200. All cribs do the same thing, which is stand
there. All cribs sold in reputable stores meet current safety
standards, so no worries in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   Shoes: Payless ShoeSource, or the equivalent, is the way to go.
Actually, barefoot is the way to go, but in those places where a
small child should wear shoes--such as needle-strewn
playgrounds--it is a waste of money to spend more than $10.99 on a
pair of shoes. We bought Daughter No. 1 three pairs of $35 shoes,
which she outgrew in a month and wore so rarely in that month that,
amortized, the shoes cost $10 per wearing, money that could have
been better spent on fireplace gas valve safety covers.
</P>
<P>
   Toys: An endless subject, one that I'm hesitant to tackle, and
my children aren't old enough for me to comment on Furby with any
authority. One general observation, though: The wrapping paper is
always more interesting to a baby than whatever's inside, so my
gift suggestion would be a cardboard box wrapped in bright red
paper and filled with Tupperware and wooden spoons. That is, if you
can stand the noise produced by wooden spoons hitting Tupperware.

EVERYDAY ECONOMICS: GUILT BY ACQUISITION
</HEADLINE>
  By STEVEN E. LANDSBURG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the German car maker Daimler-Benz announced plans to
acquire a controlling share of Chrysler Corp., Jewish novelist
Cynthia Ozick announced in the Wall Street Journal that she would
never buy a Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Other Jews (some of whom would never buy a Chrysler because
they'd only ever buy a Mercedes) saw the issue very differently.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, shortly after the merger was announced, the Jewish
Bulletin carried an article by Natalie Weinstein surveying the
range of opinion, particularly among Holocaust survivors. The
responses ran the predictable gamut. Some agreed with Ozick. But
others, such as Rabbi Ted Alexander, took their cues from
Deuteronomy, which admonishes that ``Fathers shall not be put to
death for children, neither shall children be put to death for
fathers.'' ``Going by that verse of the Torah,'' said the rabbi,
``I cannot blame this generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi's analogy treats the Daimler-Benz of 1998 as the
``child'' of the Daimler-Benz that employed slave laborers in 1943.
From a strictly legal perspective, the analogy is inaccurate: Under
the law, a corporation lives forever. The entity that controls
Chrysler is exactly the same entity that collaborated with the
Nazis, not a descendant.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be wrong to view an essentially moral question from
a strictly legal perspective. A corporation is not a moral entity;
it's the corporation's flesh and blood owners who are moral
entities. From that perspective, the rabbi's analogy fails in a
different way: The current owners of Daimler-Benz are not, by and
large, the children of previous owners from half a century ago.
Stocks trade hands every day.
</P>
<P>
   That observation seems to strengthen Alexander's position. If we
should not punish children for the sins of their fathers, then
surely we should not punish children for the sins of their fathers'
countrymen. But that analysis can be definitive only to those who
believe that nothing can be added to the words of Deuteronomy;
otherwise there's more to be said.
</P>
<P>
   When is it permissible to punish one person for the wrongs of
another? The question is a tangle of moral and economic issues.
Morally, we're concerned with things such as justice, fairness and
individual rights. Economically, we're concerned with creating good
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   To see how uncomfortable it can be when economic and moral
issues brush up against each other, consider the revision of
accident law that's been proposed by the economist-iconoclast-law
professor David Friedman. Friedman suggests that when two cars
collide causing a total of, say, $10,000 worth of damage, everyone
who was within a mile of the accident should be required to pay a
fine of $10,000. That way, anyone who sees an accident about to
happen will take all cost-justified measures to prevent it (perhaps
by honking furiously to warn of impending danger). To my knowledge,
Friedman's proposal has never struck anyone as fair, but at least
it gets the incentives right.
</P>
<P>
   Or does it? My own view is that the Friedman plan fails even by
its own strictly economic criteria, because it creates an incentive
for people to avoid high-accident areas and take inefficiently long
routes to wherever they're going--or to cancel their trips
entirely. In principle, it could even increase the accident rate by
scaring potential good Samaritans off the roads. Enforcement, of
course, would be a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Those objections aside, Friedman's proposal does illustrate the
tension between economic and moral considerations. And Friedman's
innocent bystanders are at least partly analogous to Daimler-Benz's
innocent stockholders. Let's keep those lessons in the back of our
minds as we revisit the DaimlerChrysler controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations can be punished for misdeeds in at least two ways.
One is a consumer boycott and another is a (voluntary or
involuntary) fine. Both kinds of punishment have been visited on
Daimler-Benz (though arguably at levels that are small compared
with the underlying offenses). In the 1980s, the corporation paid
about $11 million to the descendants of its slave laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Who exactly suffers from those punishments? You might think the
$11 million came from the pockets of those who owned Daimler-Benz
stock in the 1980s, but that's not necessarily the case. Suppose,
for the sake of argument, that in 1950 it becomes foreseeable that
Daimler-Benz will eventually make reparations. Then every share of
Daimler-Benz stock sold between 1950 and 1980 sells at a discount
reflecting that expectation. Without the discount, nobody would buy
the stock. So given sufficient foresight, the prospect of a 1980
punishment hurts the 1950 owners, even if they sell in the interim.
And those who buy stocks after 1950 are not punished at all,
because the discount compensates them for the fine.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, if all companies are permanently on notice that bad
behavior will eventually be punished, they have an incentive to
behave well at all times. That's an outcome that seems both fair
and economically efficient: The punishment falls on the sinners and
thereby deters the sin. But here are two caveats:
</P>
<P>
   First, even if punishment is inevitable, it falls not on the
owners at the time when the sin is committed, but on the owners at
the time when the sin is discovered. After all, it's not till the
discovery that the stock price falls. So punishing past corporate
sins is not like fining everyone who was present when an accident
occurred, but when it was reported, which seems both unfair and
pointless. But this caveat has a countercaveat: The prospect of
future punishments gives you an incentive to investigate the
corporation's history before you buy, which improves the chance
that bad behavior can be uncovered while the actual perpetrators
can still be punished.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it's hard to maintain a consumer boycott, especially
when the goal is to punish the past rather than to influence the
future. Consumers can quite reasonably argue that history can't be
changed and so is best forgotten. As a result, corporations have
little to fear from boycotts unless consumers commit themselves to
maintaining the boycotts even when they serve no purpose. It's hard
to imagine how such commitments might be maintained, which suggests
that fines are more effective than boycotts, especially if they are
written into law rather than imposed on an ad hoc basis.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a firm conclusion to all this, you'll have
to look elsewhere; I hope I've at least illuminated some of the
attendant moral and economic issues--though even these can become
very different in situations that are superficially similar.
</P>
<P>
   And punishing evil corporations is very different from punishing
evil governments. In the first case, we punish stockholders who
invested voluntarily, while in the second we punish taxpayers who
might have bitterly opposed their government's policies. But that
is a topic for another column.

MONICA (THE NAME) SUFFERS A SAD DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  By TIMOTHY NOAH 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among Monica Lewinsky's many accomplishments is that she's
achieved the type of fame where people know your last name as soon
as they've heard your first. Just as Oprah Winfrey is ``Oprah'' and
Elvis Presley is ``Elvis,'' Monica Lewinsky is ``Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica's notoriety coincides almost perfectly with the previous
calendar year. Nobody had ever heard of Monica before Jan. 15,
1998, but everybody had heard of Monica by Feb. 1, 1998, and felt
they had known Monica since birth by Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Monica is ideal for being judged by a most unforgiving
standard: How many Americans are naming their babies ``Monica''?
Sadly, not as many as last year.
</P>
<P>
   According to a tally of popular names in the U.S. by Michael
Shackleford of the Social Security Administration, ``Monica''
ranked 97th among names given to baby girls in 1998, down from 83
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, however, that the name rallied late in the year:
Shackleford's 1998 calculations are based on samples taken between
January and September.

MONEYBOX: THE NBA SPLITS A CLOSE ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, they split the difference.
</P>
<P>
   After six months of the NBA lockout, that's pretty much what
happened 29 hours before the rest of the 1998-1999 (uh, make that
1999) season was to be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   There were lots of interesting tidbits in the deal that was
eventually struck, tidbits that suggest how confused the politics
of this lockout were. For the first time in the history of sports,
there is now a maximum salary for athletes, depending on their
seniority. Players with more than 10 years can earn up to $14
million, players with between six and nine years can make up to $11
million, and players between one and five years, $9 million. (There
is a grandfather clause for current players, allowing them to
resign for up to 105 percent of their current salary.)
</P>
<P>
   Remember, it's the owners who insisted on this pretty stunning
repudiation of the free market, but somehow I don't think we're now
going to see Fortune 500 CEOs agreeing to have their salaries
capped according to their experience.
</P>
<P>
   Along the same lines, teams' control over incoming players was
further strengthened. Draftees will now have their potential
salaries in their first four years in the league limited by where
they were drafted in the first round. In other words, the higher
you were drafted, the higher your salary will, and the higher your
potential salary increases will be, regardless of how well you
play.
</P>
<P>
   If this rule were applied to the NFL, Vikings wide receiver
Randy Moss, who was drafted 19th because teams were concerned about
his reputation but who has proved to be one of the league's best
players, would be paid less in future years than whomever was
drafted fifth, merely because 18 NFL teams were stupid enough not
to draft him when he came out of college.
</P>
<P>
   The point, of course, is that the new agreement in many ways
resembles a standard union contract, with its emphasis on seniority
and on the need for players to pay their dues before they're fully
rewarded. Yet where business has traditionally attacked seniority
as paying for experience rather than for merit, in this case the
owners have embraced the idea.
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that they've done so. As I've argued before,
in the NBA the players are the means of production. So the owners
have to do everything they can to prevent the players from reaping
the real fruits of their labor.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, the players did get some tolerable, though
imperfect, concessions on the heart of the lockout, which was the
percentage of annual revenue that would be devoted to players'
salaries. In the first three years of the agreement, there will be
no limit on that percentage, and in the next three years the
players are guaranteed 55 percent. (They get 57 percent in the
seventh year, if the owners exercise their option for that year.)
The players had wanted more in those last three years, and deserved
more, but the owners had wanted to give them significantly less. So
55 percent is a victory, and not a pyrrhic one.
</P>
<P>
   I still think the lockout will be remembered as a lost
opportunity for labor, because the players never made their case
strongly enough or clearly enough. But the union did hold fairly
firm. Next time, perhaps, the difference won't have to be split.

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Communications Commission will complete
its review of three pending mega-mergers by July, in addition to
ushering in changes that include incentives to deploy high-speed
Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public address this year, FCC Chairman William
Kennard outlined his '99 agenda Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He also predicted the agency would finish reviewing the pending
mergers between AT&AMP;T Corp. and Telecommunications Inc., Bell
Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp., and SBC Communications Inc. and
Ameritech Corp. during the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   While Kennard declined to say whether the mergers would be
approved, he called the AT&AMP;T-TCI venture ``an exciting
transaction.'' The new company could generate competition in local
phone markets as well as enable AT&AMP;T to use TCI's cable lines to
offer high-speed Internet access, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T-TCI deal has received approval from the U.S. Justice
Department. The other mergers are awaiting DOJ comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our agenda this year is a full one,'' said Kennard, who was
appointed FCC chair in late 1997. ``Information technologies are
transforming our economy... And as we move into the Information
Age, we at the FCC have to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said he hopes to ease regulatory burdens on businesses
while still protecting and responding to American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this month, for example, Kennard plans to unveil
incentives to encourage companies to provide high-speed data
services to American homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Wide Web has become the World Wide Wait,'' he said.
``And that's got to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was quick to point out that the agency wasn't going to be
picking ``winners'' in the race between telephone, cable and
wireless telecommunications companies vying to bring Internet
services to residential customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep our eye on the prize,'' he said. ``And
that's alternative networks that give consumers choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard also pledged to complete the revamping of the nation's
subsidy program that keeps phone service affordable in rural and
poor areas by July.
</P>
<P>
   In the next several days, Kennard also expects to issue a long
awaited rule that will clarify whether Internet connections are
considered local or long-distance calls.

   BALANCHINE-BALLET (New York) _ George Balanchine's ballets and
City Ballet, which he founded with Lincoln Kirstein in 1948, have
lived on, not only in continuing performances but in the minds of
the company's dancers as well. This week City Ballet opened the
first of two anniversary seasons during which some 100 ballets will
be presented. A dozen dancers who have performed those ballets _ a
small sampling of the starriest and most interesting City Ballet
performers of the past five decades _ talked recently about their
memories, concerns and hopes for the company's future. By Jennifer
Dunning. (3500 words)

<P>
   SYMPHONIE-THEATER-REVIEW (New York) _ ``Symphonie Fantastique,''
an underwater puppet show. Reviewed by Jesse McKinley. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>
   NY-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ People often complain that
buildings seldom look as good as the renderings artists make of
them. But whose fault is that? The truth is that few people are
born with sharp eyes. When vision is not cultivated by memory,
shock and enthusiasm, the world can look remarkably dull. Eye
training class is now in session at the Museum of the City of New
York, where a trio of shows offers three startlingly different ways
of looking at the evolution of 20th-century New York. By Herbert
Muschamp.

 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Communications Commission will complete
its review of three pending mega-mergers by July, in addition to
ushering in changes that include incentives to deploy high-speed
Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public address this year, FCC Chairman William
Kennard outlined his '99 agenda Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He also predicted the agency would finish reviewing the pending
mergers between AT&AMP;T Corp. and Telecommunications Inc., Bell
Atlantic Corp. and GTE Corp., and SBC Communications Inc. and
Ameritech Corp. during the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   While Kennard declined to say whether the mergers would be
approved, he called the AT&AMP;T-TCI venture ``an exciting
transaction.'' The new company could generate competition in local
phone markets as well as enable AT&AMP;T to use TCI's cable lines to
offer high-speed Internet access, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T-TCI deal has received approval from the U.S. Justice
Department. The other mergers are awaiting DOJ comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our agenda this year is a full one,'' said Kennard, who was
appointed FCC chair in late 1997. ``Information technologies are
transforming our economy... And as we move into the Information
Age, we at the FCC have to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said he hopes to ease regulatory burdens on businesses
while still protecting and responding to American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this month, for example, Kennard plans to unveil
incentives to encourage companies to provide high-speed data
services to American homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Wide Web has become the World Wide Wait,'' he said.
``And that's got to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was quick to point out that the agency wasn't going to be
picking ``winners'' in the race between telephone, cable and
wireless telecommunications companies vying to bring Internet
services to residential customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep our eye on the prize,'' he said. ``And
that's alternative networks that give consumers choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard also pledged to complete the revamping of the nation's
subsidy program that keeps phone service affordable in rural and
poor areas by July.
</P>
<P>
   In the next several days, Kennard also expects to issue a long
awaited rule that will clarify whether Internet connections are
considered local or long-distance calls.

FALCONS CAN RECEIVE, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jamal Anderson got his due. Chris Chandler did, too,
along with the Atlanta Falcons' defense and Dan Reeves, the NFL's
coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Terance Mathis and Tony Martin? What did they
get? They got the questions about being overshadowed. They had
numbers that ranked with the best receiving duos in the NFL,
delivered plays when the Falcons needed them, and still, they fell
far down the list of measurable factors in the Falcons' 14-2
season.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it works on every successful team. Not everyone gets
to be the hero. Someone feels the shaft when it comes to spotlight
time, and on the Falcons, in their best year ever, it is Mathis and
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terance and I know we're good,'' Martin said. ``You get
overshadowed by the Randy Mosses and Cris Carters and all the other
big-name receivers, but those guys are good, too. But you can't
worry about who notices you. To me, that's now what this is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   What it's about is production, and Mathis and Martin can tell
you something about that. No one's claiming these two had better
years than their All-Pro peers, but let's remember this: Chandler,
the Falcons' Pro Bowl quarterback, isn't going to Hawaii for the
first time just because he handed the ball to Anderson more than
400 times this season.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody was reeling in passes. Martin caught 66 of them; Mathis
had 64 with a team-high 11 touchdown receptions, three coming
against the 49ers. They each surpassed the 1,100-yard receiving
mark, and their combined total of 2,317 yards placed them just 7
yards behind Moss and Carter of Minnesota for the league lead.
</P>
<P>
   They are to Atlanta what Ed McCaffrey and Rod Smith once were to
Denver, unheralded contributors on teams that run first and expect
their receivers to get open when it counts most.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've both made a lot of big plays for us,'' Chandler said.
``Especially Terance, who in the past hasn't been known for being a
big-play guy. But he had that long (78-yard) touchdown to ice the
game against San Francisco, and he had a couple other big ones
during the year. Then there's Tony, who's built to make big plays
with his quickness and speed. They've opened up a lot of things for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they belonged together all these years. Their backgrounds
at least suggest that. They understand humility and anonymity and
all the other things that come with the routes they've traveled.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was a former small college quarterback who wallowed in
obscurity with the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins before
blossoming into a Pro Bowl player in San Diego. Mathis was an
unwanted high school quarterback, an All-American at New Mexico and
the Jets' sixth-round draft pick in 1990. He didn't post impressive
numbers until he signed with Atlanta in 1994. With the help of a
personal trainer, he has turned into a serious deep threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read in magazines that I can't run,'' Mathis told the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ``Well, I've never had the chance as
I do now to show my speed.''
</P>
<P>
   The two became teammates June 3 in a move that turned heads.
Atlanta already had lost its best receiver, Bert Emanuel, who had
signed as an unrestricted free agent with Tampa Bay, and the
Falcons were desperate for pass catchers. Anderson said, ``I was
holding my breath on our next move because we'd had a tandem at
wide receiver and we needed another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Then in stepped San Diego. The Chargers traded Martin to Atlanta
for a second-round pick, ridding themselves of their best offensive
player in the process. It sounded like exile. For Martin, it was
bliss.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out I was being traded, I considered it a
blessing in disguise,'' Martin said. ``I didn't get along with the
coach (the since fired Kevin Gilbride). He didn't know what he was
doing, and he was telling people I couldn't get open and other
players were performing better than me. But now look at where he is
now. He doesn't even have a job, which says something.''
</P>
<P>
   This is just a guess, but Martin may be saying he still had
something to offer a team at age 33. He found the best place to do
just that. Martin was the workhorse receiver with no help in San
Diego. Now he has Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they're not an opponent's first concern and the 49ers
surely will treat them no differently. Like any team that meets the
Falcons these days, the first priorities are stopping Anderson on
the ground, pressuring Chandler and protecting the football from a
defense that led the league in creating turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The popular thinking is that it isn't Martin and Mathis who beat
you. But as many teams have learned this season, they play a key
role in the Falcons doing just that.

   NEW YORK _ People often complain that buildings seldom look as
good as the renderings artists make of them. But whose fault is
that? The truth is that few people are born with sharp eyes. When
vision is not cultivated by memory, shock and enthusiasm, the world
can look remarkably dull.
</P>
<P>
   Eye-training class is now in session at the Museum of the City
of New York, where a trio of shows offer startlingly different ways
of looking at the evolution of 20th-century New York. All three
shows focus on building as both noun and verb. They depict
buildings and building: the process and the artifacts in the making
of the modern metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the three shows demonstrate that looking is itself
an architectural act. A city is constructed daily by the glancing
perception of its parts.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the shows seduce us into subliminally intimate
relationships between consenting adults and our magnificent city.
``New York Horizontal'' features panoramic views taken by William
Hassler, a commercial photographer who captured sweeping images of
the city in the years just before and after World War I. ``New York
Vertical'' presents large-format versions of photographs by Horst
Hamann, a photographer who had the happy inspiration to turn a
panorama camera on its side and train it on slender fragments of
the Manhattan skyline.
</P>
<P>
   The third exhibition, ``New York on the Rise,'' features glamour
portraits: images of early skyscrapers painted by Hughson Hawley,
the most sought-after renderer in the United States from the turn
of the century to the advent of the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the shows gives each an added richness, but
some may find Hawley's the most vibrant work on view. Born in
England in 1850, he first worked as a scenic designer for the
stage, and his renderings have a theatrical glamour that largely
stems from his depiction of light.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, he sets his buildings against skies divided into
horizontal bands of mottled clouds, intense blue and luminous
white. Building facades are streaked with cloud shadows. These
effects bring to mind Fitzgerald's description of New York in the
1920s as a city that had all the iridescence of the beginning of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   It is a new world that we see taking shape in Hawley's
renderings: a continent that, thanks in great part to New York's
exploding skyline, has begun to cast off its sense of cultural
inferiority to Europe and grow into its own strength. Buildings
like the Woolworth Building and the Singer Tower provided the
scenic backdrop against which Paul Rosenfeld, in his groundbreaking
1925 book ``Port of New York,'' declared that the city had ceased
to be a city artists wished to flee and had instead become their
major destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come back, come back, O glittering and white!'' The Hawley
show offers ample opportunity to echo Fitzgerald's lament for the
lost city of his early years. The artist's huge, rosy rendering of
the original Waldorf-Astoria Hotel is enough to make you loathe the
Empire State Building, which now occupies the fabled hotel's site.
</P>
<P>
   A masterwork of Henry Hardenbergh, who also designed the Plaza
and Chelsea Hotels and the Dakota apartments, this palace for the
people stood for just over 30 years before it was torn down.
</P>
<P>
   No one needs additional reason to dislike 1515 Broadway, the
fintopped office building between 44th and 45th Streets that
replaced the legendary Astor Hotel. But Hawley's rendering of the
Astor helps to explain why this vanished landmark helped to anchor
Times Square in a way that the Marriott Marquis, for example, does
not.
</P>
<P>
   The Astor sits squarely on the street, throws open its grand
doors to it and enlivens the sidewalk with the tall arched windows
of its ground-floor public rooms. Had the place been allowed to
stand for 20 more years, Ian Schrager would probably now be fitting
its windows with billowing white curtains.
</P>
<P>
   But the masterpiece in the Hawley show is his rendering of a
building that still stands: Cass Gilbert's Broadway Chambers
Building just east of City Hall. This speculative office building
was Gilbert's first New York commission, and it's not an
exaggeration to regard it as the Lever House of its day, a building
that was widely regarded as the ultimate refinement of the early
skyscraper type.
</P>
<P>
   When models and drawings of the building were presented at the
Paris Exposition of 1900, Europeans rubbed their eyes. Here was an
eminently refined version of a building type made possible by
elevators, ingenuity, steel and greed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many people now pass by this building daily without giving
it a glance. The ground floor houses a costume-jewelry shop, but
the building itself is as beautiful as ever, though now it's we who
must rub our eyes to see it. The fading of alertness can be a more
tragic loss than the demolition of a building. Disenchantment is
the heavy price we pay for novelty.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Hassler's panoramic views in ``New York Horizontal'' bring to
mind the children's game of moving statues. (Stop. Don't Stop.) The
pictures, up to four feet long, were taken with a No. 8 Cirkut
Outfit camera, which came equipped with a rotating body capable of
producing 360-degree views. With some of them, the effect is of a
person whirling around, arms outstretched, as if to possess the
city by sheer exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   Possession, in fact, was Hassler's stock in trade. He worked for
real estate developers, most often for Joseph D. Day, and a number
of Hassler's pictures were made on assignment to document sites for
future development. His panoramas deserve to stand with the
paintings of Church and Burchfield as enticements for people to
settle in Arcadian settings that their settlements will ruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York Vertical'' is a blown-up, walk-through version of
Hamann's excellent book of that same title. Unfortunately, his
black-and-white photographs do not gain from being removed from
their binding and enlarged to many times their size.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is scale. The book establishes a tactile
immediacy between the city and the body. It supports the illusion
that you hold the city in your hands. Your eye takes in each image
with a single scan. The blown-up versions, though handsomely
installed, negate the intimacy between image and viewer and leave
an unfortunate impression of trade-show hyperbole. But groups of
them would do wonders for subway platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Hamann used a Linhof Technorama, a panoramic camera that makes
exceptional demands on the photographer's vision because the format
does not permit the framing that draws on the vision of the
complete image.
</P>
<P>
   Spring for the book. Hamann is a genius at composition, not only
in his framing of architectural forms but in his treatment of light
as well. His gradations of gray, the deluxe velvet of his blacks,
combined with the unexpected angles from which he often shoots,
bring an oddly abstract quality to these sharply focused renderings
of urban texture.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few of Hamann's pictures include people, and these
figures tend to appear solitary, isolated, as if weighted down by
the enormous volume of space pressing from above. Montgomery
Schuyler once described the skyscrapers of lower Manhattan
conversing among themselves at their summits like a race of giants.
</P>
<P>
   Hamann's pictures show what it's like to stand in the middle of
the conversation without the elevation to make yourself heard. But
I have a feeling that our lowly gossip is juicier than theirs.
</P>
<P>
   In Plato's ideal city, the height of buildings was to be
determined by strength of voice. A person standing in the street
should be able to understand what someone standing atop a building
is shouting. So how did it happen that in the world's most
democratic city, we hear nothing but fire engines, ambulances,
police cars and jackhammers raising the skyline to ever more
improbable heights?
</P>
<P>
   Telephones had much to do with it, and in 1882 Hawley prepared a
stunning rendering of what was then the new New York Stock
Exchange, a small classical temple festooned with telephone wires.
It's an uncharacteristic drawing, created for publication in the
rotogravure. With its sculptural massing and severe coloration, the
rendering points in the direction of Leger.
</P>
<P>
   But now, at a time when the Stock Exchange is demanding larger
quarters, it's evident that Hawley foresaw what Manuel Castels
would later call the space of flows _ the displacement of
architecture by the communications technology that now keeps the
global economy humming round the clock.
</P>
<P>
   An aura of melancholy permeates these three shows: the sensation
that artists who relate best to buildings have difficulty engaging
with people. In no way am I suggesting that these three artists
have flawed characters. I mean, rather, that their work discloses
an essential truth about the art form they record.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture is a social art. It brings people together in
space. But these images remind us that architecture originated as a
means of reckoning with mortality. In an era of festival
marketplaces, convention hotels and overly calculated ho-ho-ho, it
is useful to recall that the history of architecture leads
fantastically back toward death.

SHORT ITEMS ON HOME VIDEOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be a first: a $35 million movie that goes straight to
video without a theater run. Movies on that route usually don't
cost a fortieth of that price. They also usually don't involve a
name star and a big-time producer. But this is a peculiar case.
</P>
<P>
   The film is ``Legionnaire,'' about desert warfare in the 1920s
between the French Foreign Legion and a Moroccan tribal leader
named Abd el-Krim. The star is Jean-Claude Van Damme of action film
fame. One of the producers is Edward Pressman, whose many films
include ``Badlands,'' ``Wall Street'' and ``Reversal of Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by its looks _ richly lighted and glossy _ this is a
major movie (the cinematographer, Douglas Milsome, won an Oscar
nomination for ``Full Metal Jacket''). But in February, Sterling
Home Entertainment, a division of Lionsgate Films, is to release it
on tape. Later the USA Network will show it on cable. After that,
Lionsgate plans a theater release.
</P>
<P>
   Haven't they got it backward? ``Legionnaire'' began in theaters
in Europe, where Van Damme films have done well, and originally
that was the intention in the United States. Exhibitors weren't
enthusiastic, however. ``It was an odd animal to open,'' Pressman
said in an interview, ``so the advances offered were in the $4 or
$5 million area, which were relatively small for a film of this
scale and also indicated that it would come and go rather
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Van Damme movies ordinarily open in a large
number of theaters, making them costly to promote for a substantial
run. When it came to ``Legionnaire,'' the expense discouraged a
wide opening.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, there were two reasons, Pressman said. First, recent
Van Damme films have slumped at the domestic box office. Second,
this is a Van Damme movie that doesn't play like a Van Damme movie:
that is, a by-the-numbers mix of revenge and carnage. ``He had an
idea for a traditional kind of Foreign Legion movie,'' Pressman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legionnaire'' casts Van Damme as a sensitive ex-boxer who
double-crosses a mobster and hides out in the ranks of the damned.
``God must have been drunk when he made you,'' a drill sergeant
tells a dusty column of recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but they fight to the last man, and none more nobly
than the Van Damme character, who coddles the wounded as if he were
a Red Cross volunteer and puts up such a splendid struggle that he
is given a free pass from a Custer-like last scene by Abd el-Krim
himself.
</P>
<P>
   In its look and feel, the film resembles action adventures of
the 40s and 50s, starring perhaps Gary Cooper. Pressman sees the
Foreign Legion movie as a genre by itself. And that leads to the
object of the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Opening on video and then cable has attracted more promotion
money from companies that regard ``Legionnaire'' as an important
property and not one that falls through the cracks. Pressman said
that many more people would see the film than would have been the
case if it had been shuttled through theaters and then to video.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can give the whole genre prominence, that could lead
`Legionnaire' to being an ongoing franchise for a TV series,'' he
said. Last time that happened Buster Crabbe was Captain Gallant.

   In the mother of all concepts, the life of one ordinary young
man, Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey, left), is the subject of a
long-running _ 30 years and counting _ television show that records
every move the fellow makes. All the world dotes on this stuff,
which makes it imperative for the ``televisionary'' (Ed Harris) who
invented the show to keep Truman, who is unaware that he's being
televised, happily buttoned up in town, which is really a gigantic
sealed set done up as a pretty slice of suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, though, Truman gets the picture and rebels in Peter
Weir's film, which, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, is
clever entertainment but ``doesn't quite lead anywhere.''

   Without forsaking his usual clean look and hyper-real clarity,
Hal Hartley takes his filmmaking to a new level with a meditation
on (among other things) art, trust, loyalty, politics and popular
culture. A hapless garbage man who takes a heap of abuse from his
neighbors, Simon Grim (James Urbaniak) is taken in hand by the
brash Henry Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan), who makes a writer out of him.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, Simon's work has a profound effect on people, but
his seriousness creates tension with the ambitious Henry, a writer
himself, in a film of ``brilliance and deep resonance'' (Maslin).

   With a chance to make lively work of New York's voracious 70s
disco scene, Mark Christopher's timid, meandering film fires a
blank. The ultimate pleasure dome, Studio 54, and its social
director, Steve Rubell (Mike Myers), are setting the pace when a
good-looking 19-year-old nobody from New Jersey (Ryan Phillippe)
gains entrance and uses sex to become a star of the place.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying a soap-opera princess and club fixture, Neve Campbell
is a hopelessly insipid love interest, and Myers' caricature is
skin deep in a film that feels like ``a patched-together collection
of notes for a project that got lost on the cutting room floor''
(Stephen Holden).

</P>
<P>
   AS GOOD AS IT GETS. Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson won Academy

between a wisecracking waitress and a misanthropic writer, the
year's No. 1 renter. Columbia Tri-Star. $23.95. 138 minutes. Closed

   GOOD WILL HUNTING. Check out those equations. A janitor (Matt
Damon) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology turns out to be
a mathematical prodigy. Miramax. $19.98. 126 minutes. R.

<P>
   KISS THE GIRLS. In a film that opens fast but then loses
adrenaline, a forensic specialist (Morgan Freeman) and a young
doctor (Ashley Judd) close in on Casanova, a serial killer.
Paramount. $19.98. 117 minutes. Closed captioned. R.

<P>
   THE WEDDING SINGER. Doing his career no harm in 1998, Adam
Sandler _ star of ``The Water Boy'' _ is a singer who croons at
other people's weddings while nursing the wounds of his own
abandonment at the altar. New Line. 96 minutes. Closed captioned.

R&AMP;B GROUP'S SIGHTS SET ON SUPERSTARDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's practically impossible to tell who's who in the
muddled mess of R&AMP;B vocal groups these days.
</P>
<P>
   For the fanatics, there's Total, All Saints, Next, Blackstreet,
Changing Faces, Take 6, Silk, Immature, H-Town and SWV, just to
name a few.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of us, there's Dru Hill.
</P>
<P>
   With the release of its sophomore album, ``Enter the Dru,'' the
Baltimore-based quartet is quickly separating itself from the
aforementioned made-for-MTV acts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, its members _ Mark ``Sisqo'' Andrews, James ``Woody''
Green, Larry ``Jazz'' Anthony and Tamir ``Nokio'' Ruffin _ are
setting their sights on a superstardom equal to that of the
reigning R&AMP;B champs, Boyz II Men.
</P>
<P>
   Judging talent from one vocal group to the next is tricky
business, thanks to the numerous acts crowding the airwaves. So how
do groups stack up against each other, besides deciding whose
members are the ``cutest''?
</P>
<P>
   Music awards are always one way to measure success. Boyz II Men
seems to be the favorite choice at the Grammys each year, but Dru
Hill has tallied five Billboard Music Awards, two Soul Train Awards
and an NAACP Image Award, plus two American Music Award nominations
to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its lack of success at the Grammys, Dru Hill managed to
dominate the ``Billboard'' charts after the release of its
self-titled 1996 debut. The album, which went double platinum,
spawned five Top 10 hits, including ``Tell Me'' and ``In My Bed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Enter the Dru'' picked up where the debut left off. The first
single, ``How Deep Is Your Love,'' topped the ``Billboard'' R&AMP;B
charts and washed away any thoughts of the group being a flash in
the pan. Currently, the disc is No. 7 on the R&AMP;B album chart after
peaking at No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the members of Dru Hill are true musicians. They
are involved with the creative process of recording an album, from
writing to producing. And each member handles instrumental duties
onstage.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe nothing can indicate a group's success more than the
number of unofficial Web pages devoted to it. For Dru Hill, the fan
base is out there _ and bordering on obsessive.
</P>
<P>
   On one unofficial page's message board, a fan known as
``Sisqolover'' tells all:
</P>
<P>
   ``I LOVE SISQO SO (times 30) MUCH (times nine) I CAN'T GO TO
SLEEP WITHOUT HEARING HIS VOICE ON THE C.D. AND I JUST WANT TO KNOW
IF ANYONE KNOWS WHEN HE WILL BE COMING TO CANADA, BECAUSE I NEED TO
SEE HIM AND NOKIO AND WOODY AND JAZZ BUT I HAVE TO SEE THE ONLY
SEXY MAN ON EARTH IF U ALL KNOW WHAT I MEAN!!
</P>
<P>
   ``P.S. I LOVE DRU HILL SOOOOOOOOMUCCCCCCCHHHHH''
</P>
<P>
   Take that, Boyz II Men. &QL;

   CAMBODIA (Pailin, Cambodia) _ With the toot of a trumpet and a
ragged salute by 300 soldiers in rubber sandals, Khmer Rouge
defectors raised their new government's flag Thursday to mark the
darkest day in their history: the overthrow of their brutal

would they have to eat 1,000 extra calories a day, in the form of
favorite foods temptingly prepared by expert cooks, but they would
also have to refrain from exercising. Now, after three years, the

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The Girls are catching up to the Boys. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last few months the salaries of female stars like
Julia Roberts, Jodie Foster and Meg Ryan have, for the first time,
started closing in on the huge sums paid to male stars. The reason
is relatively simple: an acknowledgment by studios that female
audiences may have as much box office clout, at least in the United
States, as male moviegoers. (Overseas, where audiences favor action
films, is another matter).
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the domestic box office this week. The top four
pictures _ ``Patch Adams,'' ``Stepmom,'' ``You've Got Mail'' and
``The Prince of Egypt'' _ are, in the words of Terry Press, a top
Dreamworks executive, ``definitely driven by women.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently no female star receives the $20 million fee that Tom
Hanks, Tom Cruise and, lately, Adam Sandler and Leonardo DiCaprio
are receiving. Julia Roberts, the top female star, reportedly has
increased her fee to about $17 million. The actress' agent, Elaine
Goldsmith-Thomas of International Creative Management, declined to
discuss the specifics of Ms. Roberts' salary. But she did not deny
that she would probably seek $20 million for a future studio film.
</P>
<P>
   `Julia doesn't take a movie because it pays a certain amount of
money, but I don't think there should be any reason that if her
films perform as well as some of the other superstars who happen to
be male that she shouldn't be paid the same amount,'' Ms.
Goldsmith-Thomas said. She observed, as other talent agents did,
that women across the entertainment spectrum _ including those who
don't earn millions _ are simply paid less than men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why people think the entertainment business is
different than any other,'' Ms. Goldsmith-Thomas said. ``Maybe the
glass ceiling has been raised a bit. But certainly when a women
hits her head on it, she can look up and see men's loafers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the trend seems to be in favor of several female stars.
Recently, Ms. Foster was signed to star in a remake of ``Anna and
the King of Siam'' (opposite Hong Kong star Chow Yun-Fat) for a sum
that may run as high as $15 million. The success of ``You've Got
Mail'' has also pushed Ms. Ryan from the $10 million mark that she
currently earns for a studio film to about $15 million. Another
highly paid actress, Sandra Bullock, earns about $11 million for
each film.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those lavish salaries, agents and producers pointed out
that male stars with recent box office flops were still earning
more than women with stronger track records. Brad Pitt, for
example, earns about $17 million, even though several of his recent
films have flopped. George Clooney, another star with an uneven
track record, earns about the same amount as Ms. Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, it's still not equitable,'' said Jim Wiatt,
co-chairman of International Creative Management, which represents
Ms. Ryan, Ms. Foster and Ms. Roberts. ``The actresses getting top
dollar are still not getting the top dollar that the guys are
getting. It's inching toward equality. But it's not there yet.''

   `Where's the Drama?'
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Emily Watson's agent called her in London and
told her she was being offered a film, ``Hilary and Jackie,'' about
the life of the celebrated English cellist Jacqueline du Pre, and
her relationship with her sister, Hilary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Where's the drama?' '' Ms. Watson recalled. But
she agreed to meet the director, documentary filmmaker Anand
Tucker, for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came away shaking with excitement,'' she said. ``It was this
extraordinarily passionate story _ a story of this very sheltered,
gawky English girl who is not really mature or emotionally formed
and yet can sit down and play the cello with the most extraordinary
command and range that was so beyond her years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hilary and Jackie'' opened Dec. 30 in New York and Los Angeles
to strong reviews, and distribution will expand around the nation
Jan. 15. A provocative and tragic drama, the film depicts du Pre's
genius on stage and her neediness and loneliness off stage.
</P>
<P>
   Du Pre, who was married to the composer and conductor Daniel
Barenboim, was almost relieved when she discovered that her
unpredictable behavior resulted from multiple sclerosis, a
degenerative nerve disease. The condition was diagnosed in 1973,
when du Pre was 28. Her musical career was destroyed by the illness
and she died in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who get MS say actually the first symptom is euphoria:
suddenly you can put a name to what you've been going through,''
Ms. Watson said. ``You say to yourself, `It's a disease, and I have
it and I'm not going mad.' It's followed, of course, by frustration
and anger.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watson, a veteran of the London stage, was nominated for an
Academy Award for her screen debut in Lars von Trier's ``Breaking
the Waves.'' The actress has just completed filming ``Angela's
Ashes,'' adapted from the best seller by Frank McCourt and directed
by Alan Parker, in which she plays Angela, McCourt's mother.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Hilary and Jackie,'' in which she appears with Rachel
Griffiths as Hilary, a talented flutist, Ms. Watson spent three
months studying the fingering and bow work of the cello.
</P>
<P>
   ``She danced with the cello, she played it with her whole body,
she flung herself around,'' Ms. Watson said of du Pre.
</P>
<P>
   The actress also spent months meeting doctors and multiple
sclerosis patients. ``I was holed up in a room with a cello and a
wheelchair and a couple of walking sticks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watson said that the role consumed her. ``Jackie was
actually an intoxicating figure,'' she said. ``She could be
monstrous _ very demanding, very needy. But she had an ability, as
an artist, to access something that was just incredible. She
inspired worship, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watson said, almost as an afterthought, ``It was a
terrifying challenge for me because it all seemed to impossible:
learning to play the cello, learning about MS, playing this
extraordinarily complex person.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bronx Star
</P>
<P>
   Chazz Palminteri left the Bronx a long time ago, but the old
neighborhood on Belmont Avenue still haunts him.
</P>
<P>
   Palminteri has been a busy character actor since his one-man
show, ``A Bronx Tale,'' which he performed in the early 1990s in
New York, was turned into a film in 1993. In the movie, the
actor-writer starred opposite Robert De Niro, who chose the script
for his directorial debut.
</P>
<P>
   Palminteri, 48, has since appeared in Woody Allen's ``Bullets
Over Broadway,'' for which he was nominated for an Academy Award,
as well as ``The Usual Suspects,'' ``Jade'' and ``Mulholland
Falls.'' He is also in the current film ``Hurlyburly,'' directed by
Anthony Drazan and adapted by David Rabe from his drama about
hard-partying men adrift in the Hollywood Hills. The film's
ensemble cast includes Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright Penn,
Garry Shandling, Anna Paquin and Meg Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like being in the World Series of acting,'' said
Palminteri, who plays a desperate out-of-work actor ``who has
100,000 demons in him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man who lives with those demons day and night,'' he
said, adding, ``It was challenging because, in doing this role, you
had to face the darkness and demons in your own life. It was scary
and exciting at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   What has consumed Palminteri in the last few years is the
darkness and demons in the life of Dion DiMucci, known as Dion, the
1950s music star from the Bronx who was one of the originators of
rock-and-roll. Palminteri has written and plans to direct ``The
Wanderer,'' a movie about the career of Dion, who now lives in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the first one in our neighborhood to make it,''
Palminteri said. ``He was the first one to put an attitude in
music; he had that neighborhood attitude. He was a huge star. He
got involved with drugs. He became an addict. Then he fought
himself back.''
</P>
<P>
   Dion's hit songs included ``The Wanderer'' and ``Ruby Baby.''
With his group, the Belmonts, there was also ``I Wonder Why'' and
``Teen-ager in Love.'' In the late '60s, Dion returned with the hit
``Abraham, Martin and John.''
</P>
<P>
   Palminteri plans to play Dion's father, and he said he hoped
that Mark Wahlberg will play Dion.
</P>
<P>
   Palminteri lives in Manhattan with his wife and young son. He
has several films set to be released this year, among them a
comedy, ``Analyze This,'' directed by Harold Ramis, in which he
plays the head of a Mafia family and rival to a figure played by De
Niro, and an HBO movie, ``Excellent Cadavers,'' about the life of
Giovanni Falcone, the Sicilian prosecutor who took on the Mafia and
was killed by a bomb in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a Sicilian, I'm very proud to play him,'' Palminteri
said. ``I'm especially proud because Italians have always been
stigmatized for being in the Mafia. He was an enormously courageous
man.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Palminteri is putting together the finances for
``The Wanderer'' and hopes to start filming this summer. Where will
he make the film?
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx, of course.

   (italics)Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. A (Star) denotes a highly recommended film or
series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``AFFLICTION,'' starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Willem
Dafoe, Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader
(R, 114 minutes). Nolte is devastating in the performance of his
career, as Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing
battle with demons from his past. Foremost among them: Coburn,
terrifyingly authentic as the drunken, abusive father who long ago
cowed his sons into submission. As directed by Schrader, this pure,
unfettered adaptation of Russell Banks' novel starts on a
deceptively ordinary note, then escalates into inexorable fury.
Every little detail matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play
the women who trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``A BUG'S LIFE,'' featuring the voices of Dave Foley,
Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Kevin Spacey. Directed by John Lasseter and
Andrew Stanton (G, 94 minutes). The best animated ant-colony movie
of the year. And this is a more clearly defined family film than
the verbally adult ``Antz.'' With the same anthropomorphism that
gave Lasseter's ``Toy Story'' so much spark, this pastel-hued,
visually ingenious feat of animation tells a tale of ant courage
while incorporating lively wit and an enchanting sense of nature.
And it's a showcase for the incredible range of facial expressions
that make this type of animation more and more invitingly lifelike
all the time (Maslin).

<P>
   (Star) ``CENTRAL STATION,'' starring Fernanda Montenegro,
Vinicius de Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles
(R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless
older woman crosses paths with an orphaned young boy. There's
plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles'
film is all in the telling. As these characters develop a fractious
bond, then embark on a road trip that takes them vividly to
Brazil's hinterlands in search of the boy's father, Salles brings
great tenderness and surprise to the events that punctuate their
journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough bravura performance was one of
1998's very best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``A CIVIL ACTION,'' starring John Travolta, Robert Duvall
and William H. Macy. Directed by Steven Zaillian (PG-13, 120
minutes). This story of a David-Goliath lawsuit against industrial
polluters, with Travolta first rate as an ambulance chaser who
develops a conscience, could have been business as usual in the
legal thriller genre. But Zaillian's keenly observed, beautifully
acted film, based on Jonathan Harr's nonfiction best seller about a
case in Woburn, Mass., doesn't follow familiar formulas. It follows
all the surprises and frustrations of a story that was never black
and white, and is all the better for its shades of gray. Duvall is
outstanding as a corporate lawyer full of wily tricks (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``ELIZABETH,'' starring Cate Blanchett, Joseph Fiennes, Geoffrey
Rush and Christopher Eccleston. Directed by Shekhar Kapur (R, 124
minutes). In this lurid costume drama depicting Elizabeth I as a
royal rookie, the impressive Ms. Blanchett plays the Queen as if
her principal responsibilities were being bejeweled, selecting
consorts and saying ``Leave us!'' with a wave of the hand. For all
its putative concern with Roman Catholic-Protestant strife at the
start of Elizabeth's reign, this is historical drama for those
whose idea of history is back issues of Vogue. Intent on spectacle,
complete with burning at the stake and one dance scene reminiscent
of ``Saturday Night Fever,'' it winds up imagining the queen as a
glamorously stressed-out modern woman afflicted by a super-intense
case of having it all (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``ENEMY OF THE STATE,'' starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon
Voight and Regina King. Directed by Tony Scott (R, 128 minutes).
Smith goes on the run in a paranoid thriller whose high-tech gizmos
are a main attraction. He also carries the story ably in his first
real leading role, that of a successful lawyer who suddenly finds
himself under surveillance by a sizable nerd squad at the National
Security Agency and a satellite in space. Fortunately, it all
hurtles by too fast for audiences to stop for plot questions.
Sterling cast members like Hackman as an eccentric technology whiz
and Voight as a chilly advocate of surveillance tactics bring an
additional touch of class (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE FACULTY,'' starring Jordana Brewster, Clea DuVall, Laura
Harris and Josh Hartnett. Directed by Robert Rodriguez (R, 111
minutes). Like Frankenstein, ``The Faculty'' plunders the crypts of
cinema for its body parts. Here are the paranoia and parasitism of
``Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' There are the slimy,
sharp-toothed creatures of ``Alien.'' And over there are the
movie-wise teen-agers of ``Scream.'' The list could be extended,
but the point is clear: This mediocre sci-fi horror film about an
Ohio high school being taken over by thirsty space aliens intent on
world domination breaks no new ground.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie, written by Kevin Williamson, has an engaging
cast, with half a dozen appealing young actors playing the roles of
teen-agers who are all that stand between the Midwestern monsters
and the end of the world as certain moviegoers know it (Lawrence
Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``THE GENERAL,'' starring Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight.
Directed by John Boorman (not rated, 125 minutes). Boorman's best
and most stylish film in years is the deftly told story of Martin
Cahill. Nicknamed ``the General'' for his crime-plotting
strategies, this Irish gang leader and master thief is played with
splendid brio by Gleeson. Photographed gorgeously in black and
white, the film tells of his elaborate art and jewel heists, his
unusual domestic arrangement with his wife's sister and his
singular difficulties with the IRA and the law. Voight is
outstandingly good as the police detective who knows all of
Cahill's tricks (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``GODS AND MONSTERS,'' starring Ian McKellen and Brendan
Fraser. Directed by Bill Condon (not rated, 105 minutes). In a
performance that well deserves to be remembered at Academy Award
time, McKellen becomes the deliciously urbane James Whale,
depicting the gay ``Frankenstein'' director late in life. Shaken by
the aftereffects of a mild stroke, this Whale finds his past coming
back to greet him just as the present offers new fascination in the
Adonis-like form of the gardener (Fraser, also fine), whom Whale
finds mowing his lawn. This beautifully acted, witty and
heart-tugging film, from a Christopher Bram book, imagines what
Whale's final days might have been like while shaping a splendid
character study and a droll portrait of closeted gay Hollywood.
Lynn Redgrave provides ballast and comic relief as Whale's
perpetually scandalized housekeeper (Maslin).

<P>
   (Star) ``HILARY AND JACKIE,'' starring Emily Watson and Rachel
Griffiths. Directed by Anand Tucker (R, 121 minutes). The parallel
biographies of the brilliant cellist Jacqueline du Pre (Ms.
Watson), who contracted multiple sclerosis at the height of her
career, and her slightly older sister, Jackie (Ms. Griffiths), a
talented flutist who gave up a professional career to marry and be
``ordinary,'' is one of the most insightful studies of sibling
rivalry ever filmed. Jacqueline may have won fame and glory, the
movie says, but she remained a desperately needy emotional child
who had to have everything Hilary had (including Hilary's husband).
</P>
<P>
   The film is structured like a concerto, in three movements, the
last of which ends with Jackie's harrowing death in her sister's
arms. The drama is deepened by a soundtrack that makes expert use
of Jacqueline's signature piece, the Elgar Cello Concerto in E
minor. Ms. Watson's Jacqueline flames with an almost scary
intensity (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE HI-LO COUNTRY,'' starring Billy Crudup, Woody Harrelson,
Sam Elliott and Patricia Arquette. Directed by Stephen Frears (R,
114 minutes). Frears, the British director, makes a bold but
unsteady leap into classic western territory with this story of a
friendship between two cowboys who go into the cattle business
together after returning from World War II. Crudup is the shy,
laconic Pete, who secretly covets the married girlfriend of his
idol, Big Boy ( Harrelson).
</P>
<P>
   A movie that wants to be a hybrid of ``Giant,'' ``Red River''
and ``The Last Picture Show'' loses its bearings and becomes a
laborious soap opera whose red-headed bad girl (Ms. Arquette) lacks
the magnetism to make the drama sizzle. But Harrelson is a live
wire as the rootin'-tootin' last of a breed (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``HURLYBURLY,'' starring Sean Penn, Kevin Spacey, Robin
Wright Penn, Chazz Palminteri, Garry Shandling, Anna Paquin and Meg
Ryan, Directed by Anthony Drazan (R, 122 minutes). David Rabe's
screen adaptation of his 80s play about macho mind games in a
cocaine-infested Hollywood is a nasty but powerful piece of work
made all the more disturbing by the film's close-up view of its
troubled characters.
</P>
<P>
   Penn as Eddie, a Hollywood casting director on the skids,
eviscerates himself in a stunning performance full of tears, snarls
and dripping nostrils. Spacey, as Eddie's slick, ruthless housemate
Mickey, is appropriately reptilian, and Palminteri and Shandling
are creepily convincing as two of their friends. Ms. Penn, Ms.
Paquin and Ms. Ryan are the women they abuse and pass around like
trading cards. The movie, like the play, isn't so much about sex as
it is about the male incapacity for genuinely selfless friendship
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,'' directed by and starring Roberto
Benigni (PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funnyman dares to
find humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his
risk pays off. This Cannes prize winner is as stubbornly
entertaining as its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido
who jokes his way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved
ones. Daring also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks
with a more somber second act, Benigni avoids all traces of the
maudlin and effectively creates a situation in which comedy is
courage. In this unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines
as a father whose fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and
no fear (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``PATCH ADAMS,'' starring Robin Williams and Monica Potter.
Directed by Tom Shadyac (PG-13, 110 minutes). As a maverick doctor
intent on making terminal patients laugh, Williams delivers a
little clowning and a lot of maudlin feel-good sentiment, along
with vulgarity left over from the filmmaker's ``Ace Ventura'' days.
He also spends a lot of time being congratulated for his good
works, as the film's minor players are kept busy marveling at his
antics. The real-life story of this doctor may sound like a fine
occasion for Williams to cut loose, but the film version proves
narrow and predictable. Ms. Potter, with a nostrilly resemblance to
Julia Roberts, figures in a romantic subplot with a bizarre twist
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``THE PRINCE OF EGYPT,'' starring the voices of Val
Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Sandra Bullock and Michelle Pfeiffer.
Directed by Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells (PG, 93
minutes). First came the great expectations for this animated
magnum opus from Dreamworks. Then came reality, in a film
struggling mightily to balance animated whimsy and biblical
stature. The upshot is an admirably worthy rendering of the Exodus
story, even if Moses must initially be seen as a playful young
scamp. Biblical plagues and miracles serve as special inspiration
for the animators' reality-bending ingenuity (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE,'' starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth
Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench. Directed by
John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate
delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets
better as the film unfolds. The screenplay, originating as Marc
Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp
dialogue reminiscent of his ``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are
Dead,'' dares to imagine whatever it likes about the link between
Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad yearning for a certain
aristocratic beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile this tirelessly inventive comedy also envisions an
Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving
we enjoy today, and has great fun presenting the creation of
``Romeo and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow
make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully
realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``A SIMPLE PLAN,'' starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob
Thornton and Bridget Fonda. Directed by Sam Raimi (R, 120 minutes).
This onetime cult horror director makes a flawless transition to
mainstream storytelling with a quietly devastating thriller. And
its fine cast plays out the consequences of a harmless-sounding
error in judgment that winds up leveling everything in its path.
The catalyst is $4.4 million that literally falls out of the sky,
and Scott Smith's story proves how deadly the morality of
expediency can become. When you get the shivers watching this
wintry tale, which features an especially memorable performance
from Thornton, it won't be from the cold (Maslin). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``STAR TREK: INSURRECTION,'' starring Patrick Stewart, Jonathan
Frakes and Brent Spiner. Directed by Frakes (PG, 105 minutes). The
latest movie episode of the series that will not die finds Captain
Picard (Stewart) and the crew of the Enterprise saving a tribe of
utopian space pioneers who live on a planet where everyone enjoys
eternal youth. The bad guys want to relocate the people forcibly
and exploit the planet's life-giving properties.
</P>
<P>
   Picard, standing up against the admiral of Starfleet and risking
court-martial, delivers impassioned speeches about the ugly history
of forcible relocation and also falls in love with a 309-year-old
beauty (Donna Murphy). Although in its ninth movie episode, the
series has retained its sincerity and multicultural
right-mindedness. It's hokum, but executed deftly and with a warm
heart (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``STEPMOM,'' starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed
Harris. Directed by Chris Columbus (PG-13, 120 minutes). A man's
ex-wife and new girlfriend lock horns over who can be nicer to his
two children, in a sudsy story made livelier by its two female
stars, both in appealingly high gear. Ms. Roberts plays the nicest
person ever to wear black to a downtown photo shoot, while the
especially fiery Ms. Sarandon plays the suburban mother as mama
lion.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the prospect of mortality looms, the story manages to
maintain its big, lavish look and peculiar (under the
circumstances) sense of fun. As in ``Home Alone,'' Columbus directs
with sunny indifference to reality, medical, economic or otherwise
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE THIN RED LINE,'' starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick
Nolte and Sean Penn, and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Terrence
Malick (R, 166 minutes). From the first frame of this huge,
drifting war epic loosely derived from James Jones' Guadalcanal
novel, it's viscerally clear that Malick is back. The exquisite,
oddly detached visual style that made ``Badlands'' and ``Days of
Heaven'' the most beautiful films of the 1970s is instantly
apparent here, even if the narrative vagueness and brooding
voice-overs are also familiar. The film sprawls, gets lost and
occasionally delivers visual poetry, the kind that could have been
greatly helped by tighter editing. Bottom line: no one who admired
Malick's early work should miss this. But those expecting anything
simple will not find it here (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``T-REX: BACK TO THE CRETACEOUS,'' starring Peter Horton and Liz
Stauber. Directed by Brett Leonard (not rated; 45 minutes).
Passions for the prehistoric that remain unsated after the two
``Jurassic Park'' films are likely to be requited by this latest
Imax 3-D film. Drooling and menacing, the monsters of the Mesozoic
are on the march again in this brief, enjoyable dip into
paleontology, teen-age adventure and parent-child relationships.
Seen in 3-D and set against the lush ferns, moss and ancient trees
of the Olympic rain forest in the state of Washington, these
creatures seem marvelously lifelike. Its time-tripping story takes
the viewer to a paleontological dig, raises unanswered scientific
questions and introduces some of the major figures in the history
of the subject.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, seeing ``T-Rex'' won't qualify anyone for a
doctorate in paleontology, and an intriguing subplot that hints at
a troubled family background for its teen-age heroine is left
unresolved; but the film is likely to whet active young minds to
learn more about the past. At Sony Theaters Lincoln Square, 1998
Broadway, at 68th Street, Manhattan (Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``TOUCH OF EVIL,'' starring Orson Welles, Charlton Heston
and Janet Leigh. Directed by Welles (not rated, 108 minutes).
Anyone familiar with Welles' 1958 film-noir landmark knows that it
could just as well have been called ``Truckload of Evil,'' and that
its crazily sinister plot turns and breathtaking camera work remain
astonishingly fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touch of Evil'' is, among so many things, the other film to
find Janet Leigh at a lonely motel under strangely menacing
management, and the one in which Welles gave one of his most droll,
swaggering performances as a corrupt police captain in an American
town on the Mexican border. As visually thrilling as it is
sin-soaked, this artfully reconstructed version of ``Touch of
Evil'' remains one of the brightest lights on the cinematic
landscape this season (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``WAKING NED DEVINE,'' starring Ian Bannen, David Kelly
and Fionnula Flanagan. Directed by Kirk Jones (PG, 91 minutes).
Delightful shenanigans greet the news of a winning lottery ticket
in a tiny Irish village. Especially after the winner turns out to
be dead. Bannen and Kelly are wonderfully funny as two old coots
who concoct a plot to claim the winnings and unite the town's cast
of hearty characters in the process. Jones' prize-winning career
directing television commercials means that everyone here is an
amusing eccentric with colorful quirks, and that the septuagenarian
stars' naked motorcycle-riding scenes are played for all they're
worth.
</P>
<P>
   This comedy doesn't have the tart edge of ``The Full Monty,''
but it knows how to coax laughs from making a spectacle of elderly
gentlemen in the buff (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``YOU'VE GOT MAIL,'' starring Meg Ryan, Tom Hanks, Greg
Kinnear and Parker Posey. Directed by Nora Ephron (PG, 110
minutes). This cozy, inviting comedy romanticizes the rivalry
between two bookstore owners, while also finding time to fall in
love with books themselves, the instant intimacy of e-mail and a
picture-perfect rendering of Manhattan's Upper West Side. With a
feel-good ambiance much less forced than that of ``Sleepless in
Seattle,'' Ms. Ephron borrows adroitly from ``The Shop Around the
Corner'' while making this knowing, urbanely funny film very much
her own. Ms. Ryan is fresh and adorable without trying, while a
ruefully lovelorn Hanks proves that he can do anything. Again
(Maslin).

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Symphonie Fantastique'' may be, drop for drop, the
most difficult piece of theater in New York to describe.
</P>
<P>
   An underwater puppet show (more on this later), ``Symphonie''
has adjectives running for their lives. It has been variously
referred to by the city's usually nimble critical corps as an
``aquatic fabric ballet,'' a ``not-hard-to-follow abstract event''
and `` `Koyaanisqatsi' meets `Fantasia.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The piece has also prompted written comparisons to Busby
Berkeley's water follies, the advent of the motion picture and, in
many cases, drug experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing everyone seems to agree on is that ``Symphonie''
is unique, a fact supported by its remarkably vigorous downtown
run, now in its ninth month at Here, a performance space in the
South Village. Starting in May, the show will embark on an
engagement in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The man behind this mysterious spectacle and its success is
Basil Twist, a precocious 29-year-old puppet master who is the only
American ever to be accepted by _ and to graduate from _ the Ecole
Superieure Nationale des Arts de la Marionnette in northern France,
one of the world's foremost schools of the puppet arts.
</P>
<P>
   While Twist's creations may defy easy explanation, the puppeteer
himself is straightforward about his reasons for the piece. ``I
felt like I had seen everything there was and this wasn't there,''
he said. ``I wanted to make it exist.''
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly is ``it''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Symphonie Fantastique'' is an abstract puppet show performed
in a custom-designed 500-gallon fish tank, wherein dozens of pieces
of colored cloth, plastic and tinsel swim in synchronization with
the symphony of the same name by the 19th-century composer Hector
Berlioz. Oh yes, and there are colored lights, mirrors and an
underwater tornado, too, all viewed by the audience through an
opening about the size of a wide-screen television.
</P>
<P>
   If any of that sounds dry, it isn't. ``Symphonie'' may be the
only show around where bubbles get laughs. Over the course of the
hourlong performance, the audience is often heard to gasp as
fabrics, feathers, disks and beams of light swim through the water.
Writing in The New York Times, Ben Brantley said the show came ``as
close to anything I've seen to finding physical equivalents to the
abstractions of classical music.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy. For all of the hushed moments for the audience,
backstage is chaos, with four puppeteers (including Twist)
operating in a space roughly the size of a large closet. There,
surrounded by booming Berlioz, they wrestle with a menagerie of
plastic and fabric props with nicknames like the Witches, the
Weasels, the Tandem Otters and several large sheets known as the
Harriets _ a homage to Harriet Smithson, the Irish actress for whom
the love-struck Berlioz composed the ``Symphonie Fantastique'' in
1830.
</P>
<P>
   Sheathed head to toe in black, the puppeteers stand behind the
tank or sit on platforms above it, bobbing, swishing their hips,
humming along with the rhythm to keep pace with the symphony. Water
flies everywhere as puppeteers yank fabric in and out of the tank
to the chirping encouragement of Twist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one moment that's like milking a cow, up and down, up
and down,'' said Anushka Carter, one of the puppeteers, who follows
the beat by singing ``twee-twee-twee-twee-stop'' at one interlude.
``People say it's like watching a very busy New York kitchen, but I
think it's rather like performing a dance or being in a
cheerleading session.''
</P>
<P>
   While Twist has trained eight puppeteers to fill in for him, he
usually presides over the show. By all accounts he is mercilessly
cheery.
</P>
<P>
   ``One-two-three-four-go,'' he said during a recent performance,
smiling and humming Berlioz's melody between words. ``And spin it.
Spin it. Spin it. Spin it!''
</P>
<P>
   For Twist, the show and its genesis are littered with familial
artifacts. Twist was born into a family with puppets in its blood;
his grandfather, Griff Williams, was a 1930s band leader who used
puppets carved in the likenesses of jazz performers like Cab
Calloway and Harry James to liven up sagging shows. The puppets
were handed down to the young Twist and eventually landed in the
hallway outside the theater in which ``Symphonie'' is performed.
</P>
<P>
   Twist's mother, Lynne, also played with puppets, founding an
amateur troupe that performed at hospitals and schools in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Twist grew up there, working his way through an alternative
elementary school and a preppy high school. As a child he was a
self-declared ``puppet freak,'' making elaborate Halloween costumes
(``I was a giant sandwich one year'') and ``Star Wars'' robots out
of discarded pantyhose containers. But he dropped the habit when he
got to high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed so sissy and childish,'' he said. ``It just wasn't
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   His puppet love stayed under wraps until 1989, when he became a
visiting student at New York University. On a whim one afternoon,
he stopped by the Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center
and found an exhibition of the work of Julie Taymor, a director who
would later win fame for her puppet-inspired work on ``The Lion
King.'' Fascinated, Twist returned the next day, only to find the
exhibition being dismantled by a young woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Julie Taymor,'' Twist said. ``I introduced myself and
helped her pack up.''
</P>
<P>
   Their friendship brought an introduction to the city's ``Puppet
Mafia,'' as Twist called it, and led to several nonpaying jobs
backstage at puppet shows around New York.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, Twist had the urge to go back to school, an impulse
that eventually led him to France's national school for puppeteers.
He had no idea that the institution, in Charleville-Mezieres, had
never accepted an American student.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I lied on the application and said I could speak French,'' he
said. ``I had no idea what I was getting into.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, it had been all ping-pong balls and fur and pipe
cleaners,'' he explained. ``There, there were books on the walls.
Very austere. It was a very different puppet atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   But Twist quickly made his mark, using rap music and
voluptuously dressed puppets. ``I used more sequins than most
students,'' he said. ``I was made consciously aware of my own
American style.''
</P>
<P>
   He also began to sense something of a creative void in the
genre: the abstract puppet show.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Twist returned to the United States and
started to work on experimental pieces, often showing his work in
gay nightclubs downtown. ``There'd be a drag queen lip-synching,
and then I'd go on,'' he said. ``People freaked.''
</P>
<P>
   One piece, a tribute to the camp lounge singer Yma Sumac,
included a pas de deux between a feather and a cutout shape. Ideas
in that piece would eventually be worked into ``Symphonie.''
</P>
<P>
   Twist chose the medium first: water, a substance long used by
special-effects tricksters to create ghostly, otherworldly images.
Then came the music. He remembered Berlioz's symphony _ and its
story of tortured romance _ from his parents' record collection.
``I was drawn to the cover art,'' he said. ``It was a blurred
ballerina.''
</P>
<P>
   He started with a small 10-gallon tank and slowly worked his way
up to a 70-gallon version, toiling alone and watching his movements
with a mirror. The current 500-gallon tank was specially built by a
friend of his father, who builds and races competitive yachts.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he needed a theater. Twist wanted to present the show
at Here, a space where he had operated a puppet in ``Epidog,'' a
play by Lee Breuer, in 1995. But Here's organizers did not have the
money to finish its planned basement theater.
</P>
<P>
   Twist once again turned to his family. His grandmother, Dorothy
B. Williams, had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and wanted to
make a lasting contribution before her death. She donated the final
$20,000 needed to complete the 74-seat theater, and attended the
show's opening night in May. Ms. Williams died in September, and
the theater now bears her name.
</P>
<P>
   Twist has since been named curator of Here's Dream Music
Puppetry Program, named for a theme song of his grandfather's.
</P>
<P>
   But Twist's daily association with ``Symphonie'' at Here will be
be curtailed starting Jan. 22, when he will take a monthlong hiatus
to travel to San Francisco to work on Breuer's ``Peter and Wendy.''
There he will also begin preparations for the San Francisco
production of ``Symphonie,'' with an even larger tank.
</P>
<P>
   When he returns to New York in late February, he said, he will
scale back performances to work on a new show. People are
constantly suggesting which piece of music he should adapt next.
``Some people say Debussy, some say Berlioz, others Pink Floyd,''
Twist said. ``But I don't think it will necessarily be in a tank.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, then added, ``Maybe in a pond.''
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES:
</P>
<P>
   ``Symphonie Fantastique'' is performed at Here, 145 Avenue of
the Americas, at Dominick Street, Manhattan, (212) 647-0202,
Tuesdays through Fridays at 7 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 10:30 p.m.;
Sundays at 5 p.m. Tickets: $20 to $50; $15, children 12 and under;
$10, standing room.

 &HT;    BATTLE OVER BANANAS GOES TO THE BRINK -- AND U.S. CONSUMERS

   MIAMI _ A taste of the tropics, nearly everyone loves
potassium-rich bananas. But this delicate fruit has split the
United States and Europe in a nasty trans-Atlantic tug-of-war that
could soon spell trouble for American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Clinton administration is expected to announce
that it will go ahead with plans to slap 100 percent tariffs on
$590 million worth of European goods as soon as Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The move is designed to force the European Union -- which gives
preferences to banana growers in former colonies, particularly
those in the Caribbean -- to open its markets to bananas produced
in Latin America by U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   For U.S. consumers, the retaliatory measure could double prices
on everything from cheese to linens to candles to cashmere
sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   European wines have been excluded at the request of American
wine producers, who are negotiating their own access to European
markets.
</P>
<P>
   But even more is at stake than higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Experts fear that one retaliation could spark another, igniting
a real trade war between the United States and the European Union
that could threaten two-way trade estimated at more than $400
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The battle also raises serious questions about whether two
economic powerhouses can ever resolve major disagreements through
the World Trade Organization, the Geneva, Switzerland-based arbiter
of international trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
   And it raises concerns over the future of U.S. relations with
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout that region, leaders have blasted Washington as the
enemy in their fight to preserve the economic lifeblood of their
tiny, banana-dependent societies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is pulling the rug right out from under these
fragile economies,'' said Hazel Ross-Robinson, a Washington
attorney who lobbies for Caribbean nations. ``It is sending a
message that the Caribbean's no longer on its radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing as much as 90 percent of all export income, bananas
are to tiny islands such as St. Lucia and St. Vincent what cars are
to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean leaders charge that without preferential treatment
they could lose the European market because their bananas cost more
to export.
</P>
<P>
   And if they do lose the market, they warn it could spark a
massive wave of immigration by residents seeking work in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   It also could boost the drug trade, as many would turn to
producing marijuana or even to helping drug smugglers to make ends
meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just a question of bananas, it is a question of
the entire economic existence of a group of English-speaking
Caribbean nations,'' said Larry Birns, director of the Council on
Hemispheric Affairs, a Washington, D.C.-based research group.
</P>
<P>
   But despite such dire predictions, the United States and Europe
have been slipping toward a trade war over bananas for more than
six years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the European system, which dates back to July 1993, banana
growers in former colonies such as Jamaica and Martinique get
greater access to the European market than growers in Latin
American countries, even though Latin-grown bananas are cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Caribbean grows about 4 perent of the world's
bananas and about 10 percent of bananas sold in the European
market.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's system has incensed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based Chiquita
Co., which grows bananas in Central and South America and charges
that quotas are strangling its access to Europe's lucrative $5
billion banana market.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita's controlling shareholder is Carl Lindner, a political
heavyweight and major contributor to both Republicans and Democrats
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was at Lindner's urging that the United States joined
Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico in petitioning the WTO in
1996 to review objections to Europe's import system and to settle
the trade dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiquita connection has given Europeans and others the
license to level accusations that U.S. moves to open European
markets are strictly motivated by money and politics --
particularly since bananas aren't grown commercially in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. policy on bananas is clearly driven by political
donations, and little else,'' Birns said.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials deny the charge, saying this issue centers
squarely on Europe's failure to comply with the world's rules of
fair trade.
</P>
<P>
   And if compliance isn't forced, then other WTO members that lose
cases to the United States in the future may feel free to take no
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe's system directly protects the interests of growers in
Europe and in former colonies to the detriment of all other
international interests,'' said Jay Ziegler, spokesman for the
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler said U.S. intentions to impose new tariffs will likely
be announced Thursday(Jan. 14).
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, the WTO supported U.S. charges by ruling that
Europe's laws unfairly discriminate against Latin American bananas.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was upheld by a WTO appeals body.
</P>
<P>
   Europe then revised its import rules, but the United States
contends the changes are ``cosmetic,'' and still run afoul of trade
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than return to the WTO for a resolution -- the route
favored by Europe -- the United States raised the stakes in the
battle with the threat of new tariffs, first announced last
November.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if Europe doesn't contest the retaliatory measure later
this month, new tariffs could be implemented as early as February.
If Europe does contest, the new tariffs could be implemented by
March 3.
</P>
<P>
   Europe could itself also choose to retaliate, meaning American
exports to the European Union may be hit with higher tariffs or
tighter quotas.
</P>
<P>
   European officials have accused the United States of subverting
the dispute-settlement mechanism that's at the core of the WTO with
threats of sanctions they dub ``unilateralism at its worst.''
</P>
<P>
   But many economic experts believe the United States has made a
solid case against Europe, and agree that the credibility of the
world's trade rules is at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European Union feels like the United States is putting a
gun to its head,'' said Jeffrey Schott, of the Institute for
International Economics in Washington. ``But if the big guys don't
have to comply with WTO rules, what is their value?''

bananas and about 10 percent of bananas sold in the European
market.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's system has incensed the Cincinnati, Ohio-based Chiquita
Co., which grows bananas in Central and South America and charges
that quotas are strangling its access to Europe's lucrative $5
billion banana market.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita's controlling shareholder is Carl Lindner, a political
heavyweight and major contributor to both Republicans and Democrats
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was at Lindner's urging that the United States joined
Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico in petitioning the WTO in
1996 to review objections to Europe's import system and to settle
the trade dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiquita connection has given Europeans and others the
license to level accusations that U.S. moves to open European
markets are strictly motivated by money and politics --
particularly since bananas aren't grown commercially in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. policy on bananas is clearly driven by political
donations, and little else,'' Birns said.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials deny the charge, saying this issue centers
squarely on Europe's failure to comply with the world's rules of
fair trade.
</P>
<P>
   And if compliance isn't forced, then other WTO members that lose
cases to the United States in the future may feel free to take no
action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe's system directly protects the interests of growers in
Europe and in former colonies to the detriment of all other
international interests,'' said Jay Ziegler, spokesman for the
Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler said U.S. intentions to impose new tariffs will likely
be announced Thursday(Jan. 14).
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, the WTO supported U.S. charges by ruling that
Europe's laws unfairly discriminate against Latin American bananas.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was upheld by a WTO appeals body.
</P>
<P>
   Europe then revised its import rules, but the United States
contends the changes are ``cosmetic,'' and still run afoul of trade
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than return to the WTO for a resolution -- the route
favored by Europe -- the United States raised the stakes in the
battle with the threat of new tariffs, first announced last
November.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if Europe doesn't contest the retaliatory measure later
this month, new tariffs could be implemented as early as February.
If Europe does contest, the new tariffs could be implemented by
March 3.
</P>
<P>
   Europe could itself also choose to retaliate, meaning American
exports to the European Union may be hit with higher tariffs or
tighter quotas.
</P>
<P>
   European officials have accused the United States of subverting
the dispute-settlement mechanism that's at the core of the WTO with
threats of sanctions they dub ``unilateralism at its worst.''
</P>
<P>
   But many economic experts believe the United States has made a
solid case against Europe, and agree that the credibility of the
world's trade rules is at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European Union feels like the United States is putting a
gun to its head,'' said Jeffrey Schott, of the Institute for
International Economics in Washington. ``But if the big guys don't
have to comply with WTO rules, what is their value?''

 CITY BALLET: 50 YEARS OF THRILLS FOR STARS 
</HEADLINE>

consecutively.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Balanchine always talked about his ballets as if
they were something only for the moment, for now _ his familiar
word,'' Mikhail Baryshnikov wrote in the foreword to ``Tribute''
(William Morrow, $50), a recent book of pictures and essays
celebrating the New York City Ballet's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   But George Balanchine's ballets and City Ballet, which he
founded with Lincoln Kirstein in 1948, have lived on long past
their moment of creation, not only in continuing performances but
in the minds of the company's dancers as well.
</P>
<P>
   This week City Ballet opened the first of two anniversary
seasons during which some 100 ballets will be presented. A dozen
dancers who have performed those ballets _ a small sampling of the
starriest and most interesting City Ballet performers of the past
five decades _ talked recently about their memories, concerns and
hopes for the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Tallchief
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tallchief danced with City Ballet from 1948 to 1965 and was
its first star. One of her earliest and most popular parts was the
title role in Balanchine's ``Firebird,'' in which she starred with
Francisco Moncion. Set to music by Stravinsky and with sets
designed by Chagall, the piece was first performed in November
1949, the company's second season at City Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``George had been giving wonderful classes as always, and I
noticed there were many intricate jumping steps,'' Ms. Tallchief
said. ``And I thought, those steps are fascinating. One in one
combination, another in another combination later. Well, he got to
choreographing my variation in `Firebird,' and he put all those
steps together.
</P>
<P>
   ``So there I was,'' she continued, ``confronted with an almost
impossible variation to dance. Turned out, turned in, quickly going
from one direction or another, with such speed. With two golden
spotlights and the stage completely dark, because he was afraid the
Chagall scenery would overpower the dancers.''
</P>
<P>
   The dress rehearsal was not reassuring. ``Poor Frank Moncion,''
Ms. Tallchief said. ``We had our dress rehearsal at 7 o'clock in
the morning of that dark Monday when we were going to dance
`Firebird' that night, the opening. It was supposed to be a dress
rehearsal, but my costume didn't arrive until the intermission
before I was to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``Frank was not what you would call a morning
person. Fortunately I am. I was all ready and I'd warmed up. This
was the first time we had seen the lights. He couldn't find my
arms. It was just a catastrophe. It was frightening. And of course
we never practiced any bows. Who would have thought that anybody
would applaud? I went home and I thought, well, I'm going to take a
little nap. And all I could think of was all the things that were
impossible, that I would never be able to do. So I rushed back to
the City Center and again into my practice clothes, trying to get
ready for that evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overture started. No one knew what to expect, and actually
it was very interesting. At the beginning of the pas de deux _ when
the Firebird turns to go to the corner and she does an arabesque
and then leaps into the air, backwards with her head _ at that
point the audience went `Uhhh!' I thought, Oh, my God, there's
something happening here. And then I suddenly realized that we were
doing something magical.''
</P>
<P>
   When the curtain went down, there was suddenly ``just an uproar
in the audience,'' Ms. Tallchief recalled. ``It was like a football
stadium. And Frank had left. He didn't think there were going to be
any bows. So George and I ended up taking the bows together.''
</P>
<P>
   The company kept adding performances of the ballet to its
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seemed to be dancing `Firebird' eight times during the
week,'' Ms. Tallchief said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaun O'Brien
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien proved that a gifted actor-dancer can survive and even
flourish in a ballet company known for its dance values. In a
career with City Ballet that bridged all five decades, from 1949 to
1991, he was best known for his nuanced, dramatically detailed
creation of Dr. Coppelius in the 1974 Balanchine-Alexandra Danilova
production of ``Coppelia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Balanchine left me alone,'' O'Brien said. ``He almost never
gave me any corrections.'' Knowing that, the dancer said, he would
``go as far ahead with any role as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine would occasionally stop him and ask why he had done
something, O'Brien said. Simply because it felt right, he responded
on one occasion. ``Well, all right,'' Balanchine told him.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien watched the company grow and change over 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, it was very budgety at City Ballet,'' he
said. ``Everyone thinks the fact that the costumes were almost all
black and white was an artistic decision on Balanchine's part. I
think it became an artistic decision. But it started out that way
because they couldn't afford anything else and he liked the look.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegra Kent
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kent performed with City Ballet from 1953 to 1982. Her roles
included the ballerina in the second and third movements of
Balanchine's 1948 ``Symphony in C,'' danced to Bizet, and the lady
in the hat in Jerome Robbins' comical 1956 ``Concert,'' set to
Chopin.
</P>
<P>
   ```Symphony in C' was the first ballet I saw with the New York
City Ballet, in 1951,'' Ms. Kent said. ``I had come to New York
with my mother and had just gotten into the School of American
Ballet. There were other things on the program that night. But I
fell in love with `Symphony in C.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kent soon found herself in the ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music is exquisite,'' she said. ``It has mysteries in it,
yearnings and mystery. It sweeps you up into dance somehow, with
the quality of movement that Balanchine creates on stage.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' ``Concert'' presented more of a challenge. Parody, Ms.
Kent believes, is hard to do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry, as part of his direction, never wanted us to play
something up as comedy,'' she said. ``Particularly in `The
Concert.' These people are very, very believable, so it shouldn't
be overdone. It should be played as itself. He wanted it to have
its own reality, and that would make it funny. He didn't want the
hellzapoppin flavor in it. This is a thing I see now with the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Mitchell
</P>
<P>
   The first black dancer to become a star in modern American
ballet, Mitchell danced with City Ballet from 1956 to 1971. One of
his most notable roles was in the central pas de deux in
Balanchine's 1957 ``Agon,'' danced with Diana Adams, a white
ballerina. The edgy modernist work, danced to Stravinsky, is
considered one of the great masterpieces of 20th-century ballet.
Mitchell is now the director of the Dance Theater of Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that `Agon' added another dimension to the
neoclassical repertoire,'' Mitchell said. ``And it still is one of
the finest pieces, I think, that Balanchine's ever done.''
</P>
<P>
   The ballet was very far ahead of its time, he added, and is
enjoyed today not only by dance aficionados but by young children
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of the computer mentality that exists today
with kids, it's like seeing a computer live in terms of the
counterpoints, the rhythms, the tempi, the counts and the music,''
Mitchell said. He compared the ballet to a live version of video
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. B. said that dance was movement in time and space,''
Mitchell said. ```Agon' is the perfect example, where it is not so
much the placement of the dancer, it is the movement through time
and space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think using an interracial couple is important to the
ballet, particularly the pas de deux. Because of the color. The
black and white. That's why he said, when he was choreographing
`Agon,' that `this was the longest it has ever taken me to do
anything.' Everything had to be exactly right. And it wasn't the
steps. It was where I would put my hand. How we would cross our
wrists. So that the colors played an integral part in the
choreography.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Villella
</P>
<P>
   Villella, who is the artistic director of the Miami City Ballet,
joined City Ballet in 1957 and left in 1979. Among the ballets in
which he created roles was Balanchine's 1963 ``Bugaku,'' an erotic
quasi-Japanese marriage ritual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was this bouncing ball,'' Villella recalled. ``Jumps, turns.
Do all the tricks. That was kind of what I did. What I knew. That
was the easiest for me. Then along comes a role like `Bugaku,'
where you have to submerge all that and get into manners, style,
approach and understanding characterization and relationship. So it
was a wonderful, wonderful early opportunity to think about how to
make a role.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of opportunity, Villella said, is one of the best
things that can happen to a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have such a focus now on technique and competition and all
of this stuff,'' he said. ``Sometimes you look at people, and I'm
talking probably mostly about guys, and they look the same no
matter what prince they're doing. Mostly the tricks look the same.
It's wonderful when you can see somebody step into a role and get
lost in that.''
</P>
<P>
   And there is great theater in the ballets, Villella added, for
dancers who wish to go beyond technique.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia McBride
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McBride danced with City Ballet from 1959 to 1989. A sunny
Dionysian counterpart to the Apollonian Suzanne Farrell, the
company's other prima ballerina of the time, Ms. McBride was with
the company when it left City Center for Lincoln Center in 1964.
She and her husband, the former City Ballet principal Jean-Pierre
Bonnefoux, now direct the North Carolina Dance Theater in
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McBride said she learned many of her early roles from their
earliest interpreters because the company was not yet very old when
she joined. Tanaquil LeClercq taught her ``La Valse,'' and she
learned ``Allegro Brillante'' from Patricia Wilde and ``The Cage''
from Melissa Hayden and Diana Adams. Balanchine taught her ``Scotch
Symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine the dancers now not having Balanchine and
Jerry there,'' Ms. McBride said. ``In all these roles I have
visions of Mr. B. and Jerry together. The two of them showing me
these things.''
</P>
<P>
   She tried, she recalled, to ``put myself in their bodies and be
them.'' The memory of Balanchine demonstrating her variation
``Fascinatin' Rhythm'' in ``Who Cares?'' has lingered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so much better than I was in that variation,'' she
said. ``And it was so easy for him to choreograph. It never really
changed. You'd get in the studio. He'd roll the sleeves up on his
white shirt or whatever and just get going. He knew what you would
do, and what a woman could do on point.''
</P>
<P>
   The dancers had to learn to move in a bigger way, in bigger and
more elaborate productions, when the company moved to Lincoln
Center, she said. At that time, Balanchine began teaching daily
class again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big change in the style,'' Ms. McBride said. ``City
Center was so tiny. You had to learn to move bigger at Lincoln
Center. Everything was more exhausting. The dance became much
broader.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux
</P>
<P>
   Bonnefoux was a principal dancer with the Paris Opera Ballet
when he left to join City Ballet, where he danced from 1970 to
1980. A favorite role was the lead in Balanchine's 1928 ``Apollo,''
set to Stravinsky, which is said to have signaled the birth of
neoclassicism in ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life changed the day when I met Balanchine in Berlin,''
Bonnefoux recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He had gone to Berlin to work with the choreographer for a few
days on ``Apollo.'' He was startled to realize that Balanchine had
conceived his innovative way of approaching movement long ago, in
the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell I had so much to learn,'' he said. ``It was such
a discovery of the energy of the piece, not something trying to
represent something else. But it was an energy that you could bring
into the piece yourself. So it was very personal. You could move
your body in that way, in the abstract, but it was more than that.
It was also bigger than yourself. It was a great piece that you
would become a part of. A part of dance history really.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was not so much about portraying a young god as it was about
developing himself in the role, he said, in the process learning
how to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God I was OK with that,'' Bonnefoux continued. ``I was
not too overwhelmed. I was 27 years old and doing well in Paris and
Europe. But I knew there was more to it than that. And he was the
man who made you believe that ballet was still modern.''
</P>
<P>
   Young dancers, he said, felt that ballet was finished. ``I
wanted to get away from ballet and do something else. And then I
met that older man.''
</P>
<P>
   What Balanchine was doing, he told the young French dancer, was
very close to what Marius Petipa, the great Russian classical
stylist of Balanchine's youthful training, did. It was also very
close to what his new pupil had learned at the Paris Opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's modern,'' Balanchine told him. ``It can be modern. It
can be of our time. It's classicism.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Martins
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 Martins left the Royal Danish Ballet to join City
Ballet. He became company director in 1983 after Balanchine died
and has choreographed many works for the company. Balanchine
created ``Duo Concertant'' for Martins and Kay Mazzo, for the
company's 1972 Stravinsky Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day there was a rehearsal for Kay and myself in the
practice room, a tiny little room up on the fifth floor,'' Martins
said. ``And Balanchine walked in and choreographed a whole section
of `Duo.' And then there was no rehearsal for another week or so.
He had to go to `Symphony in Three Movements' and `Violin
Concerto.' When he came back a week or two later, I had forgotten
everything. I had a little recollection of a few things, but I
embarrassingly stood there and said, `Mr. B, I don't remember
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Martins was petrified, he recalled, but Balanchine nonchalantly
rechoreographed from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Martins also spoke of his work as company director. ``It's a
lifelong mission,'' he said, ``to keep this place alive. In every
way. Artistically, creatively, financially, morally. To keep this
place functioning and not just to keep it running smoothly but also
to produce and create new works and create new dancers and inspire
them and make it a living organization rather than the old cliche,
a museum. To keep it alive and fresh and functioning in the times
in which we live is really all I can hope for.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Luders
</P>
<P>
   Luders danced with the Royal Danish Ballet before joining City
Ballet in 1975. He retired from the company in 1994 and taught at
the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet for a year
before returning to Copenhagen, where he now lives, teaches and
performs. His first big role at City Ballet was the Phlegmatic solo
in Balanchine's signature 1946 ``Four Temperaments,'' set to music
by Hindemith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a a role that I kept evolving in and moving around
in,'' Luders said. ``It became like part of my skin, I would say.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Balanchine rechoreographed part of the solo for him.
Todd Bolender, who originated the role, told the young Danish
dancer that Balanchine had put things back into the role that
Bolender had done and that had been discarded for later dancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very patient,'' Luders said of Balanchine. ``He was
always very concerned that you look good in it. He didn't care what
the other people did. He was willing to redo things for that
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine did not want his dancers to intellectualize a role or
emote in it, Luders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The choreography speaks for itself,'' he continued. ``If you
just did the steps, it came through, what he wanted. The steps were
just so particular for that part.''
</P>
<P>
   Heather Watts
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watts danced with the City Ballet from 1970 to 1995. She was
the first major ``Martins ballerina'' and performed with Daniel
Duell in Martins' quirkily astringent 1978 ``Calcium Light Night.''
Set to music by Ives, it was his first major ballet for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calcium Light Night'' was ``a hard ballet,'' Ms. Watts said.
``But it was very instructive for me. I wasn't the strongest dancer
in the world then.'' The ballet grew out of the lessons in
pointwork that Balanchine decided to give Martins, with ``your
girlfriend,'' as Balanchine referred to Ms. Watts, as the very
willing guinea pig. Dancing ``Calcium Light Night'' strengthened
Ms. Watts' technique and feet, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ```Calcium' is a tremendous ballet for girls to dance, in terms
of improving their pointwork,'' Ms. Watts said. ``You point and
flex a thousand times in a three-minute solo.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking of the future, Ms. Watts said she hoped dancers would
understand how hard Balanchine, Kirstein and Martins worked to
allow them ``their dream of being a dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the dance police, the self-appointed Balanchine
experts, would let him and his ballets rest in peace in the
company. I wish they would quit talking about their golden years.
For all of us, nothing compares to the moment when you walk in and
see ballet and really get it. Nothing will ever be like the first
time I saw Allegra and Eddie doing `Bugaku.' But that doesn't mean
that next week when Darci or Wendy does it, it's not wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Balanchine, Ms. Watts said, ``hated all that pretentious
gobbledygook. He believed in ballet as technique and craft and then
whatever happens on top of that. He didn't choreograph `Barocco' to
be about the moon and stars. It's there. It is celestial. But it's
about ballet.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kyra Nichols
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nichols joined City Ballet in 1973 and is a principal today.
She has frequently performed Balanchine's 1940 ``Concerto
Barocco,'' a signature work set to Bach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I danced it years ago, for many years, starting with the
second girl. Suzanne was the first girl. Peter was the boy. It was
always very much an honor. Balanchine rehearsed a lot. He wanted
the girls to be as close as possible but separate. Almost back to
back. And it really works when people do that. You really see the
music.'' The score's two violin lines become visible, she said, in
the choreography for the two women.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many sides to Balanchine and his choreography, Ms.
Nichols said. Take ``Liebeslieder Walzer,'' a favorite of hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for people to see that side of
Balanchine, which has been kind of overshadowed by the black and
white ballets,'' she said. `` `Liebeslieder' is not about
technique. It's about atmosphere, quality.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Ms. Nichols' 25th year with City Ballet. She is one of
the few dancers left who worked with Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had such a wonderful career,'' she said. ``I would just
hope that Balanchine and Jerry will continue to have a primary
place there. Of course the company needs fresh blood. But I hope
the younger dancers never lose them.''
</P>
<P>
   Miranda Weese
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weese is a young principal, who joined City Ballet in 1993.
As much at home in the more classical ``tutu ballets'' as in
neoclassical ``leotard ballets,'' she will dance this weekend at
all performances in Balanchine's ``Symphony in C,'' ``Episodes,''
``Four Temperaments'' and ``Symphony in Three Movements.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up watching American Ballet Theater and the Kirov
Ballet in all the traditionally classical ballets,'' she said. ``So
a part of me is drawn to that more classical field. Except that I
always felt it was a little slower. Something was missing for me.''
</P>
<P>
   She was drawn to Balanchine's ``Theme and Variations,'' she
said, because that tutu ballet was ``a little faster and a little
bit more innovative, but still a tutu ballet and still with an
imperial, grand feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To be out there,'' she said, ``dancing to that music and still
feeling like a woman, or like a princess, in your tutu, is very
powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Leotard ballets,'' Ms. Weese said, ``always give you more of
almost like a naked feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're out there, you feel very exposed,'' she continued,
``but the choreography is usually more of that neoclassical, more
of a raw approach. Which is also Balanchine. He had all of those
interesting ballets as well as the tutus and `Symphony in C.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dancers at City Ballet, she added, can ``go from one night
wearing your tutu to the next night with your leotard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a completely different atmosphere, energy,'' she said.
``Completely different choreography. There are many facets to each
individual, so it's an incredible thing to experience all of
yourself. You can do that in a matter of a week in our repertory.''

ARTS(AT)LARGE 
 MUSEUMS, MONEY AND THE MAINSTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They haven't chilled the champagne yet at the Guggenheim Museum,
but the digital art scene provided plenty of other reasons to
celebrate this year.
</P>
<P>
   When the Guggenheim revealed its vision for a ``Virtual Museum''
last June, the launch was set for New Year's Eve. According to
Matthew Drutt, the curator overseeing the ambitious online project,
the site is now scheduled to be unveiled in the first quarter of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the postponement, the Guggenheim continues to broaden
its plans for the site, in another example of one of the major
trends in digital culture in 1998: the museum world's surprisingly
rapid acceptance of the Web as a medium for works of art and for
arts education.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech firms often speak of time in ``dog years,'' claiming
their industry evolves so quickly that one year for a conventional
business is like seven for theirs. But at the beginning of 1998,
few would have expected institutions renowned for their snail-paced
embrace of the new to keep up with their canine-paced counterparts
in the business world.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately -- if not downright remarkably -- a handful of
progressive-minded officials at the Whitney Museum of American Art,
the New York and San Francisco museums of modern art and
less-iconic institutions like the Dia Center for the Arts in
Manhattan and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis announced new or
future projects that are transforming their Web sites from
marketing endeavors into valuable arts resources.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim site was conceived as a digital addition to the
museum's network of architecturally distinctive locations. ``Like
all great works of architecture, this one is subject to myriad
delays as we make progress,'' Drutt said. ``It has nothing to do
with city building permits; it has to do with learning curves and
not wanting to launch something we won't stick with for more than a
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Drutt said the design team is still reviewing techniques for
displaying the site in three dimensions, but that the look and feel
of the online structure, which is being created by the New York
firm Asymptote Architecture, are essentially complete.
</P>
<P>
   When the site is put up on the Web -- and, if it is not
otherwise occupied, on the video wall at the Guggenheim's SoHo
location -- the first exhibit will be simply the ``building''
itself. But Drutt said plans for filling the space with art are
proceeding well. The museum has commissioned works for the site by
the artists Adrianne Wortzel and Rainer Ganahl, and a new piece by
the sound sculptor Bill Fontana will be installed on the Web as
well as at each of the Guggenheim's real-world incarnations.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this kind of high-profile financial support for
artists is still a relatively rarity in the world of digital art
and design. Apart from actual creative events, foraging for
financing was probably the most-practiced activity among digital
artists in 1998 -- and will be again in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   As a case in point, the contributors to HELL.com, a vast
creative project housed at a secret online location, will launch on
Friday the first public exhibition of their covert work. Boasting
previously unseen pieces by the digital artists Jef Morlan, Michael
Samyn, Philip Wood and a dozen others, the ``Surface'' show will be
open only to 50,000 registrants with properly configured browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Aronson, the founder of HELL.com, hopes that in addition
to attracting attention to some infernally cutting-edge work, the
brief unlocking of its gate will attract some sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is being funded out of dust,'' Aronson said. ``We hope to
create some sort of paradigm where people can sponsor what we're
doing in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Aronson established his hothouse as a safe place for artistic
risk-taking, away from prying eyes, commercial considerations and
users with obsolete browsers. He said the artists who have
contributed work to the site, which now number 60, remaincommitted
to the underworld undertaking as a labor of unpaid love.
</P>
<P>
   But adapting even a fraction of the technically sophisticated
HELL.com projects for public access was a time-consuming task,
Aronson said, and patronage will assure that future exhibits can be
held.
</P>
<P>
   While everyone hunts for sponsorship -- whether it be
commercial, nonprofit or private -- there are good signs that the
search may yield better results sooner rather than later. In fact,
the best sign may be a movie marquee for ``You've Got Mail.''
</P>
<P>
   More interesting than the film itself is that its underlying
premise of a romance enabled by e-mail has been completely taken
for granted by the movie-going public. In other words, regardless
of how one feels about America Online's fast-food approach to the
Internet, 1998 will mark the year that bytes came to be viewed as a
standard part of the mainstream's cultural diet.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent, this is also happening on the stage.
Patrick Marber's drama ``Closer,'' a hit on London's West End and
due on Broadway in the spring, seamlessly integrates an online-sex
scene into its onstage action. Craig Lucas's ``The Dying Gaul,''
arguably the best play of the year, employs the Internet to much
greater effect. Initially, the characters use e-mail for
role-playing and truth-telling, but cyberspace quickly assumes
spiritual and metaphysical dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of sampling and digital recording, technology is
already a given in the music business. But corporations outside the
entertainment field, particularly those in style-oriented
industries like liquor and fashion, are also starting to capitalize
on digital artistry.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Plumb Design's Thinkmap, a 3-D navigation device
used to dazzling effect in the firm's own Visual Thesaurus and in
the Smithsonian Institution's online-only Revealing Things exhibit,
has just surfaced as the interface for the Web site of the rum
purveyor Bacardi Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't get much more mainstream than that. Indeed, if you
don't mind mixing your liquors, a little champagne might be in
order.

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT COMMITS TO TECHNOLOGY FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year was the year the federal government made a major, if
bumpily launched, commitment to help pay for technology in
America's primary and secondary school classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   And 1999 could well be the year that school officials and others
begin taking a hard look at how that money and similar local
technology investments are being put to use.
</P>
<P>
   That is the consensus of a small panel of education and
technology experts who agreed to do some Janus-like looking back
and looking ahead for this column.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed that the controversy surrounding ``E-rate,'' the new
federal program that helps wire schools, was one of the major
education-and-technology stories of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The program, formally known as the Universal Service Support
Mechanism for Schools and Libraries, but nicknamed E-rate for
``educational rate,'' subsidizes wiring and other
telecommunications-related expenses at almost all public and
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   It was never popular with long-distance telephone companies,
which were footing its bill, or with some members of Congress, who
viewed it as a new tax. The program was to have received financing
for its first year of up to $2.25 billion. After much delay and
debate, the financing was cut to $1.3 billion, and aimed largely at
the nation's poorest schools.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many who favor computers in the classroom saw the
survival of the program as a victory. Keith R. Krueger, executive
director of the Consortium for School Networking, a nonprofit
Washington, D.C., group that promotes the use of technology in
schools, likens the possible effect of the program to the federal
``land grant'' acts of the 1800s, which helped established many of
the nation's state universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The E-rate has given schools and libraries the ability to have
a sustainable funding source to make sure they are getting
connected to the information technologies of the future,'' he said,
adding: ``This is fundamental for the 21st century school.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, few people are predicting that the legislative
battles that engulfed the E-rate program in 1998 will disappear in
1999. Krueger and others foresee renewed attempts in Congress, for
example, to revive a failed 1998 measure that would have required
schools and libraries that accept E-rate financing to employ
filtering software. Supporters of the filters say they help keep
Internet pornography from children; critics say they often screen
out arguably legitimate material, like medical information, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Around the nation, such battles did not revolve just around
pornography in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, debate followed a proposal to replace textbooks with
laptop computers, as some educators asked just how much truly
worthy educational material could be found online or in CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   A new book, ``Failure to Connect: How Computers Affect Our
Children's Minds -- For Better and Worse'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), by
the educational psychologist Jane M. Healy, argued that too often
computers offer students an empty substitute for a good teacher.
</P>
<P>
   And all over the country, opponents of advertising in schools
expressed concern about a new company, ZapMe!, that is providing
free computers and related equipment to schools in exchange for
advertising that appears on the computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   A groundbreaking study by the Educational Testing Service in
Princeton, N.J., and sponsored by the journal Education Week
complicated the debate over whether computers are adequate
substitutes for more traditional learning tools. The study,
released in September, found mixed results when computers were used
to assist in math instruction in fourth and eight grades. Eighth
graders who used the devices for sophisticated applications, like
simulations, showed significant gains, while peers who used the
devices for rote drill lost ground. Meanwhile, fourth graders
showed little gains when using computers for math games.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Anne L. Bryant, executive director of the
Alexandria, Va.-based National School Boards Association, was
encouraged by the results, saying they were the among the first
pieces of hard evidence that technology, when used in the right
way, can help children learn.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, she expects to see school officials demanding
much more proof in 1999 that the local and national
multibillion-dollar investment in school computers is worthwhile.
``School boards are going to be asking increasingly: 'Demonstrate
to us that this has results,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   William L. Rukeyser, coordinator of Learning in the Real World,
a group based in Woodland, Calif., that urges greater skepticism
about the educational possibilities of computers, said he expected
to see growing attention to a related question: Are computer
terminals a suitable substitute for paper when it comes to study.
</P>
<P>
   He believes educators will increasingly become aware that as
vast as the Internet is, it still lacks a lot of essential
educational material. And he believes they will start asking
whether students can engage in the thoughtful reading required by
serious learning when they are looking at a screen. ``I think in
1999, there will be an escalation of interest in whether computers
and the Internet can replace printed material,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one technology expert is hoping that promoters of
school computers make a special resolution for 1999: that they will
teach students not only how to use technology, but how to use it
wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Chapman, a syndicated columnist and director of The 21st
Century Project at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs
at the University of Texas in Austin, is dismayed that so many
schools rely on ``acceptable use policies,'' often carefully worded
documents crafted by lawyers more interested in
litigation-avoidance than education.
</P>
<P>
   ``These do nothing to educate parents and kids about responsible
use of the Internet,'' Chapman said.
</P>
<P>
   So what does he think schools should do instead starting in the
new year?
</P>
<P>
   Teach students everything from ways to evaluate the accuracy of
information on a Web site, to why ``flaming,'' or harshly
criticizing via e-mail, is at odds with civil discourse, to ways to
avoid online copyright violations online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as equivalent to drivers' ed for cyberspace,'' he
said.

MAJOR COURT DECISIONS TO SHAPE THE INTERNET IN 1999 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   H.L. Mencken, the sage of Baltimore, once advised that when
crafting an editorial, it is better to be wrong than timorous. The
same truth might be applied to the prognostication business, where
boldness counts. With that in mind, Cyber Law Journal asked a panel
of legal experts to predict the most significant or interesting
developments in Internet law and policy for 1999. What follows are
edited excerpts from some of their fearless responses.
</P>
<P>
   Eben Moglen, professor, Columbia Law School:
</P>
<P>
   1. U.S. v. Microsoft: Should it happen that Microsoft is found
liable for antitrust violations, the single most important legal
event of 1999 will be the decision as to what do about it. The
right answer is to make slight compulsory licensing changes to
allow the volunteer programmers all over the world who write the
free GNU/Linux operating system to release code freely that would
make GNU/Linux run Windows applications programs. That way anyone
who now uses Windows-based programs of any kind could run those
programs either under Windows or under a much more technically
sophisticated but completely free alternative operating system.
Immediately, Microsoft would have the strongest possible
competition in its core market, eliminating the problem of possible
coercion of other market participants, and with a minimum of
government intervention in industry.
</P>
<P>
   2. Encryption regulation implodes: Next year people will become
generally aware that every multimedia notebook on the planet can be
turned into a strong-encryption secure telephone at no cost, using
freely available software. The recognition that traditional
encryption regulation is entirely obsolete will spur further
development around the world in both authoritarian and libertarian
directions, depending on local government conditions.
</P>
<P>
   3. Personal information privacy: As the European Union and the
United States try to find a modus vivendi for the continued
exchange of commercial data, U.S. insistence on free-market,
minimum-regulation approaches to information privacy will come
under intense pressure, as a new consumer movement tries to use
international privacy law to rein in the behavior of large
corporations in the U.S. economy. This story will come to no
resolution in 1999, but it will rise to a prominence it never had
before.
</P>
<P>
   Blake A. Bell, counsel, Simpson Thacher &AMP; Bartlett:
</P>
<P>
   I believe that as massive numbers of inexperienced investors
begin to invest through online brokers, we are going to see
increased instances of investor losses that lead to arbitration
claims against the brokers, alleging that investors were permitted
to trade themselves to ruin through risky investments that were
unsuitable for them and that the brokers should have known were
unsuitable for them.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey R. Kuester, partner, Thomas, Kayden, Horstemeyer &AMP;
Risley:
</P>
<P>
   1. More Internet patents. The patents that were issued last year
were filed in 1995, when commercial use of the Internet was new.
Consequently, a much larger number of Internet patents should be
granted in 1999. Patents prevent others from doing certain things,
such as designing and maintaining certain types of Web sites. Thus,
as more and more Internet patents are issued this year, there will
be more electronic landmines to avoid for all companies with an
Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   2. Hyperlinking. In 1999, the Ticketmaster v. Microsoft case
should begin to shed light on the legality of hyperlinking without
permission. (Ticketmaster sued Microsoft in federal court in 1997,
challenging Microsoft Sidewalk's right to link to pages deep within
its site, bypassing its home page.) Most attorneys around the
country have been waiting a long time for guidance from the
Ticketmaster case. Ticketmaster certainly thinks there is a
trademark problem with unauthorized deep hyperlinking. Since both
sides in the matter have both the money and apparent intent to
fully argue the issue, this case is definitely the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth C. Bass III, partner, Venable, Baetjer and Howard:
</P>
<P>
   (Bass represented the library trustees in Loudoun County,
Virginia, in their defense of a strict content filtering policy on
library computer terminals available to adults. The policy was
deemed unconstitutional by a federal district court judge.)
</P>
<P>
   1. The decision in U.S. v. Microsoft -- a critical
first-decision on the future of the leading software producer and
the effects of legal controls on software development. At least as
significant as Judge Greene's AT&AMP;T decisions (which led to the
breakup of the company). The Microsoft trial verdict will either
reinforce Microsoft's marketing and business approach to the world
of software and the Internet, or cause a substantial rearrangement
in the companies that do Internet software business. In short, the
decision will either lead to a continuation of Netscape-like
startups or rapid transition to a Microsoft-controlled oligopoly of
Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   2. A second judicial decision, either by way of appeal in the
Loudoun case or by way of a second litigation, adopting the 'other'
view (that filtering of library terminals for adults does not
violate the First Amendment) and setting the stage for U.S. Supreme
Court resolution of the novel legal issues. . . . I genuinely
believe (the Loudoun County filtering policy) will ultimately
prevail when, and if, the issue ever gets to the appeals court or
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Dan L. Burk, professor, Seton Hall Law School:
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, I'd say the most significant thing pending is the
certain re-introduction of database legislation in Congress. This
legislation nearly passed last year, but was stopped at the last
minute because there wasn't enough time for hearing or compromise.
It is extremely controversial -- it would create a new form of
intellectual property in databases. Critics claim it wold create
significant barriers to small database providers, allowing large
information industry companies to gain monopolies over collections
of information.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Clarida, attorney, Cowan Liebowitz &AMP; Latman:
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, it will be interesting to see what, if anything,
happens with database protection in Congress. Also, I'm looking
forward to the Second Circuit decision in Tasini v. New York Times,
which will be a major decision affecting electronic rights for
freelance writers, no matter how it comes out.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Froomkin, professor, University of Miami School of Law:
</P>
<P>
   1. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will decide
the Bernstein case. Originally taken up on an ``expedited'' basis
almost a year ago and inexplicably delayed since, the court is
being asked to rule that Daniel Bernstein's cryptographic source
code is First Amendment speech, and hence exportable, or that no
program is covered by the First Amendment. A win for Bernstein
means the case will go to the Supreme Court; a loss will invite the
government to re-write the export control rules to include, for the
first time in our history, a ban on the export of some books
(because the books reprint certain encryption source codes that the
government says are illegal to export).
</P>
<P>
   2. Law enforcement officers will spend increasing hours online
posing as child pornographers and young girls. As a result there
will be more media-friendly arrests of Internet users for
obscenity-related offenses. As a political result, if logical non
sequitur, the FBI will renew its calls for domestic controls of
cryptography.
</P>
<P>
   Yaman Akdeniz, director of Cyber-Rights &AMP; Cyber-Liberties (UK)
and Researcher at the Cyberlaw Research Unit, Faculty of Law,
University of Leeds:
</P>
<P>
   1. In 1998, the European Commission announced a draft
``Directive on Certain Legal Aspects of Electronic Commerce in the
Internal Market.'' I look forward to the final version of the
report and its implementation in 1999, as it will clarify for good
the issue of Internet service provider liability within Europe.
According to the draft directive, ISPs shall not be liable, other
than for injunctive relief, for the information transmitted, on
condition that the provider does not initiate the transmission,
does not select the receiver of the transmission, and does not
select and does not modify the information contained in the
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   2. A further threat to cyber-speech will come from the
development of rating and filtering systems outside the United
States. Currently, these blunter instruments are being developed
within the European Union under the EU action plan on promoting
safe use of the Internet, but such technological solutions will
only give a false sense of security to parents and concerned users
rather than addressing the potential problems.

freely available software. The recognition that traditional
encryption regulation is entirely obsolete will spur further
development around the world in both authoritarian and libertarian
directions, depending on local government conditions.
</P>
<P>
   3. Personal information privacy: As the European Union and the
United States try to find a modus vivendi for the continued
exchange of commercial data, U.S. insistence on free-market,
minimum-regulation approaches to information privacy will come
under intense pressure, as a new consumer movement tries to use
international privacy law to rein in the behavior of large
corporations in the U.S. economy. This story will come to no
resolution in 1999, but it will rise to a prominence it never had
before.
</P>
<P>
   Blake A. Bell, counsel, Simpson Thacher &AMP; Bartlett:
</P>
<P>
   I believe that as massive numbers of inexperienced investors
begin to invest through online brokers, we are going to see
increased instances of investor losses that lead to arbitration
claims against the brokers, alleging that investors were permitted
to trade themselves to ruin through risky investments that were
unsuitable for them and that the brokers should have known were
unsuitable for them.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey R. Kuester, partner, Thomas, Kayden, Horstemeyer &AMP;
Risley:
</P>
<P>
   1. More Internet patents. The patents that were issued last year
were filed in 1995, when commercial use of the Internet was new.
Consequently, a much larger number of Internet patents should be
granted in 1999. Patents prevent others from doing certain things,
such as designing and maintaining certain types of Web sites. Thus,
as more and more Internet patents are issued this year, there will
be more electronic landmines to avoid for all companies with an
Internet presence.
</P>
<P>
   2. Hyperlinking. In 1999, the Ticketmaster v. Microsoft case
should begin to shed light on the legality of hyperlinking without
permission. (Ticketmaster sued Microsoft in federal court in 1997,
challenging Microsoft Sidewalk's right to link to pages deep within
its site, bypassing its home page.) Most attorneys around the
country have been waiting a long time for guidance from the
Ticketmaster case. Ticketmaster certainly thinks there is a
trademark problem with unauthorized deep hyperlinking. Since both
sides in the matter have both the money and apparent intent to
fully argue the issue, this case is definitely the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth C. Bass III, partner, Venable, Baetjer and Howard:
</P>
<P>
   (Bass represented the library trustees in Loudoun County,
Virginia, in their defense of a strict content filtering policy on
library computer terminals available to adults. The policy was
deemed unconstitutional by a federal district court judge.)
</P>
<P>
   1. The decision in U.S. v. Microsoft -- a critical
first-decision on the future of the leading software producer and
the effects of legal controls on software development. At least as
significant as Judge Greene's AT&AMP;T decisions (which led to the
breakup of the company). The Microsoft trial verdict will either
reinforce Microsoft's marketing and business approach to the world
of software and the Internet, or cause a substantial rearrangement
in the companies that do Internet software business. In short, the
decision will either lead to a continuation of Netscape-like
startups or rapid transition to a Microsoft-controlled oligopoly of
Internet software.
</P>
<P>
   2. A second judicial decision, either by way of appeal in the
Loudoun case or by way of a second litigation, adopting the 'other'
view (that filtering of library terminals for adults does not
violate the First Amendment) and setting the stage for U.S. Supreme
Court resolution of the novel legal issues. . . . I genuinely
believe (the Loudoun County filtering policy) will ultimately
prevail when, and if, the issue ever gets to the appeals court or
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Dan L. Burk, professor, Seton Hall Law School:
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, I'd say the most significant thing pending is the
certain re-introduction of database legislation in Congress. This
legislation nearly passed last year, but was stopped at the last
minute because there wasn't enough time for hearing or compromise.
It is extremely controversial -- it would create a new form of
intellectual property in databases. Critics claim it wold create
significant barriers to small database providers, allowing large
information industry companies to gain monopolies over collections
of information.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Clarida, attorney, Cowan Liebowitz &AMP; Latman:
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, it will be interesting to see what, if anything,
happens with database protection in Congress. Also, I'm looking
forward to the Second Circuit decision in Tasini v. New York Times,
which will be a major decision affecting electronic rights for
freelance writers, no matter how it comes out.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Froomkin, professor, University of Miami School of Law:
</P>
<P>
   1. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will decide
the Bernstein case. Originally taken up on an ``expedited'' basis
almost a year ago and inexplicably delayed since, the court is
being asked to rule that Daniel Bernstein's cryptographic source
code is First Amendment speech, and hence exportable, or that no
program is covered by the First Amendment. A win for Bernstein
means the case will go to the Supreme Court; a loss will invite the
government to re-write the export control rules to include, for the
first time in our history, a ban on the export of some books
(because the books reprint certain encryption source codes that the
government says are illegal to export).
</P>
<P>
   2. Law enforcement officers will spend increasing hours online
posing as child pornographers and young girls. As a result there
will be more media-friendly arrests of Internet users for
obscenity-related offenses. As a political result, if logical non
sequitur, the FBI will renew its calls for domestic controls of
cryptography.
</P>
<P>
   Yaman Akdeniz, director of Cyber-Rights &AMP; Cyber-Liberties (UK)
and Researcher at the Cyberlaw Research Unit, Faculty of Law,
University of Leeds:
</P>
<P>
   1. In 1998, the European Commission announced a draft
``Directive on Certain Legal Aspects of Electronic Commerce in the
Internal Market.'' I look forward to the final version of the
report and its implementation in 1999, as it will clarify for good
the issue of Internet service provider liability within Europe.
According to the draft directive, ISPs shall not be liable, other
than for injunctive relief, for the information transmitted, on
condition that the provider does not initiate the transmission,
does not select the receiver of the transmission, and does not
select and does not modify the information contained in the
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   2. A further threat to cyber-speech will come from the
development of rating and filtering systems outside the United
States. Currently, these blunter instruments are being developed
within the European Union under the EU action plan on promoting
safe use of the Internet, but such technological solutions will
only give a false sense of security to parents and concerned users
rather than addressing the potential problems.

AN E-MAIL DEVICE TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calling one of the new Motorola Smart Pagers the PageWriter 2000
was a smart idea. The device does seem like the future of
interactive paging.
</P>
<P>
   While two-way paging has been around for a couple of years now,
the smart pagers are the next generation. And there are vast
improvements in the capability of this new generation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to two-way paging, which sends preset responses to
another pager or e-mail address, you can get customized news, stock
quotes, travel directions, phone numbers, schedule events and load
new applications from third-party vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The PageWriter uses the FLEX operating system. While Motorola is
encouraging software developers to write applications using FLEX as
the standard, and a number of vendors have signed on, it is still
too early to say if the vendor community will take to FLEX in a big
way.
</P>
<P>
   The PageWriter 2000 acts more like a hand-held device than a
pager. Like the Palm Pilot or any of the Windows CE devices, it is
not only a standalone unit, but a PC companion as well. You don't
need a laptop to make the PageWriter 2000 fulfill its functions
effectively, but there are some things better done on a laptop and
then transferred to the pager. You can write messages, set alarms,
and add people to the address book using the pager, but it is much
easier on the laptop. It is time-consuming on the pager's keyboard.
Even two-fingered typists would be hard-pressed to quickly enter
text messages on the pager's tiny keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the PageWriter 2000/PC linking software, called
Flex Partner, is its weakest link. I was surprised to discover that
there is no way to compose a message on the laptop and transfer it
to the pager. You can only use the PC software to delete and
organize mail from the pager. This is a major drawback in the
system.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem with the software is that you must be
connected to the pager via a serial cable to do anything. You can't
work off-line and sync when you are finished. The only thing that
the Flex Partner software is good for is to load new applications.
For me, the connection to the laptop is useless for everything else
and needs a major overhaul before it serves its purpose.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the screen on the PageWriter 2000 is a
pleasant surprise. While it measures only three inches diagonally,
it is sharp and readable. The back light, activated by a separate
key, is very bright. And if you have poor eyesight, you can change
the font to bigger letters. I compared the screen resolution and
back-light brightness to the Palm III, and the PageWriter 2000 was
the clear-- pardon the pun -- winner.
</P>
<P>
   I am impressed with the overall design of the PageWriter 2000. A
lot of thought went into making it work simply on the pager side. I
just wish as much thought had gone into the PC software. Most
functions on the pager can be used with just three keys: the cursor
controls, called the NavDisc, the Tab key and the Enter key. When
in doubt, hit the Home key and start over.
</P>
<P>
   While it is easy to navigate around the PageWriter 2000, there
are a lot of functions, especially if you install new applications;
it can take some time to become facile with them.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies offer optional services in addition to the
standard two-way page, which is provided by SkyTel. For example,
Wolfe Tech Pocket Genie is an optional service that gives you all
kinds of on-demand information, including phone directory services
and driving directions. The company keeps adding new services.
There is even a listing on its services that asks subscribers to
suggest new services. The company is offering a two-week trial of
the service via a download at their Web site.
</P>
<P>
   For all the things that I really like about the PageWriter 2000,
it is really behind the times. If it had come out three years ago
(and the software worked properly), the Palm Pilot would be a niche
gadget.
</P>
<P>
   The pager is also too big, being about a third again larger than
a standard two-way pager. It has infrared support, but you have to
use the cradle/charger to connect to the laptop. It also has
built-in infrared, but you need a cable to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   If you need great two-way paging and information on demand, the
PageWriter fills the bill. But if you have any other devices that
need to communicate with it, stick with the standard two-way pager.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many states have pledged to hold schools more
accountable for low student performance, but few have made good on
their threats, according to a report released Thursday by Education
Week magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Texas and North Carolina have the most comprehensive policies to
reward or punish educators based on student achievement, according
to the report ``Quality Counts '99.''
</P>
<P>
   The two states use all six of the magazine's criteria: statewide
student testing, school report cards, ratings comparing schools to
others in the district and state, rewards to high-performing
schools, assistance to failing schools, and sanctions, Education
Week editors said. The school report cards offer statistics that
include student improvement, teacher qualifications and graduation
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which looked at all 50 states, showed that only 19
states in 1999 will evaluate schools or plan to release public
ratings. Those 19 states also provide assistance to low-performing
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, Ohio and Colorado were among the states that had few
policies in place to evaluate and rate schools or punish them when
students don't perform well.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen states, including Texas and North Carolina, have the
``ultimate sanction'' _ laws giving state officials the power to
close, take over or overhaul chronically failing schools. But only
Texas, New York and Oklahoma have ever closed or completely
overhauled persistently failing schools, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The study aimed to show how rarely state school policies
</P>
<P>
   are enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when taxpayers are demanding results from schools
and the public's patience with persistently failing schools is
wearing thin, states must develop effective strategies to reward
schools that succeed and target assistance to those that don't,''
said Virginia Edwards, editor of Education Week. The magazine is
owned by Editorial Projects in Education, a non-profit organization
based in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Florida received high marks in the magazine evaluations for
having one of the country's strongest incentives for teachers to
earn national board certification. The state pays the $1,800 to
$2,000 application fee and offers a 10 percent pay increase to
those who complete certification.
</P>
<P>
   Forty states now have performance standards for the four core
academic subjects, up from 38 last year. Those subjects are math,
science, English and history.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 250 parents, employers and educators across the
country showed that when it comes to consequences for
low-performing schools, a wide disparity exists between what
teachers and parents support. While 66 percent of parents surveyed
said schools should be overhauled if students perform poorly, 68
percent of teachers disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   About 77 percent of parents surveyed said principals should work
under contracts that can be terminated if their schools fail to
reach specific goals. However, 64 percent of teachers said it is a
bad idea, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the largest national teachers union said while
some schools should be overhauled, other alternatives should be
considered before resorting to such drastic measures.
</P>
<P>
   States should first look closely at the reasons for poor
performance, since the problems may stem from poor discipline
policies, inadequate curriculum or overcrowded classrooms, said
Janet Bass, spokeswoman for the American Federation of Teachers,
which represents more than 1 million educators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think teachers want to be part of the solution,'' Bass said.
``People are desperate to point the finger and sometimes principals
and teachers are an easy target. Teachers have good ideas and there
are proven programs out there that teachers would love to
implement.''
</P>
<P>
   The analysis was completed by Achieve Inc., a non-governmental
agency established by governors and business leaders across the
nation after an education summit in 1996. The group offers
information to state leaders to help improve schools.

NO HORSE HEADS, BUT PLENTY OF PROZAC 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: production notes are at end of article)  
 (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tony Soprano lives in a large house in suburban New Jersey, paid
for by the family business, garbage hauling; he spends his days
sitting around drinking espresso with like-minded businessmen; he
has a white-haired old relative called Uncle Junior, who is
fighting him for control of the business.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of Mafia membership are so much a part of American
lore that the witty new HBO series ``The Sopranos'' takes off with
the speed of an inside joke. Every viewer knows what the Soprano
business really is and understands Tony's character: the murdering,
the soft spot for Mama, the code of honor, the juggling of his
loyal wife and some hot girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   What ``The Sopranos'' adds is a clever 90s twist. Tony has been
having panic attacks, not due to qualms of conscience, but because
business isn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are trending downwards,'' he says, sounding for a
moment as if he were on Wall Street. But Uncle Junior (Dominic
Chianese) thinks Tony's less disciplined, now middle-aged
generation is responsible. ``We used to be recession proof; no
more,'' he complains to Tony's mother. ``You can't blame it all on
the Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   If ``The Sopranos'' evokes films like ``Goodfellas'' with its
fierce action and insider's view of the Mafia, the series has a
sizable dose of ``Married to the Mob'' in its tongue-in-cheek
attitude. Combining dark comedy and psychological drama, the show
achieves a fresh tone to match its irresistibly winning concept.
</P>
<P>
   And its knowing approach, shaped by mob movies as much as by
tabloid stars like John Gotti, signals a generational shift in
Mafia movies, reflecting the series' theme of tensions between old
and new visions of the mob. Though the four episodes available for
preview are uneven, with the first among the best, ``The Sopranos''
is one of the more sustained and engaging new shows to arrive in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The story is framed by Tony's reluctant visits to an unlikely
psychiatrist. Lorraine Bracco, unable to completely shed her
drawling delivery and streetwise accent, is never believable as the
enigmatic Italian-American shrink, Jennifer Melfi.
</P>
<P>
   But Tony's discomfort at the very idea of being treated by a
psychiatrist is among the series' central and most effective jokes.
One of New Jersey's most powerful wise guys is soon on Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   James Gandolfini is terrifically dynamic as Tony, finding just
the right balance. The character is not admirable or entirely
likable, but he is always fascinating and sympathetic. He is
burdened, for example, with a maddeningly stubborn, hotheaded
nephew, Christopher, who adds yet another generational dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher (Michael Imperioli, just as exasperating as the role
calls for) decides to hijack a truck that is under Uncle Junior's
protection, setting off an explosive battle that Tony has to quiet.
``Last time I take any initiative,'' Christopher says. (Actually,
that's a cleaned-up version of the series' raw language, which is
equaled by its violence and nudity.)
</P>
<P>
   It is an indication of how well the series works that at such
moments viewers are instantly absorbed into Tony's code. Of course,
we think Christopher is an idiot; we never question whether Tony's
worldview may be a little wobbly itself.
</P>
<P>
   In another shrewd twist, Tony is a tough guy surrounded by
tougher women. Edie Falco (better known as a prison guard in
``Oz'') is especially good as Tony's social-climbing wife, Carmela,
who threatens to leave him if he quits therapy. Nancy Marchand, who
usually plays bluebloods, is less convincing as his mother, Livia,
though her scenes are among the series' liveliest and best-written.
</P>
<P>
   A perpetually dissatisfied and scowling troublemaker, Livia
fractures the stereotype of the kindly mob mother. And Tony's
rebellious teen-age daughter is named Meadow (Jamie Lynn Sigler), a
choice perfect in its gauche, wrongheaded attempt to blend into
respectable society.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Light moments are scattered through ``The Sopranos.'' Concerned
about the future of what he calls the ``waste management''
business, Tony diversifies. He comes up with an HMO scam. ``Could
be as good as garbage,'' he speculates.
</P>
<P>
   But the many darker scenes have bloody consequences. Though the
straight-ahead action is effective, it inevitably seems less
original than the revisionist attitude. In the third episode,
directed by Nick Gomez (among the many directors and writers
handling the series' 13 episodes), Meadow's school concert is
intercut with a mob killing in which a traitor is shot through the
eye. This is an obvious reference to one of the most famous
sequences in ``The Godfather,'' intercutting a baptism with a
murder spree. But it feels more like grand theft than homage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' was created by David Chase. His previous
credits, including the sensitive racial drama ``I'll Fly Away,''
could never have predicted this laser-sharp, wry invention. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The PJs
</P>
<P>
   Fox, Sunday night at 8:30
</P>
<P>
   (Channel 5 in New York) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The title of this animated comedy series refers to ``the
projects,'' a crumbling, low-income high-rise where Thurgood Stubbs
(the voice of Eddie Murphy, also one of the producers) works as the
super. With puffy cheeks and mouths that seem pasted on, the
characters in ``The PJs'' are made of foam and animated in a
stop-motion technique. They look similar to the California raisins,
though are not nearly as entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   The show takes advantage of the way animation can exaggerate for
effect, though that often turns out to be nothing more than
stereotyping. Thurgood has graying foot-high hair, a big belly and
denim overalls. His wife, Muriel (Loretta Devine), is kind,
maternal and has a prominent rear end.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin (Crystal Scales) is a good boy in the building who
idolizes Thurgood. Juicy (Michele Morgan) is a fat boy who wears a
sign saying, ``Please do not feed me.''
</P>
<P>
   There may have been potential here, but the first episode is
deadening in its lame comedy and obvious reach for good lessons.
Thurgood teaches Calvin that he should go to school and not grow up
to be a super. The humor relies on jokes about Thurgood's head
landing in a toilet. ``I'm goin' in,'' he tells Calvin, holding a
plunger aloft. ``If I don't make it, tell Muriel I died with my
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   After its preview on Sunday, the show moves to its regular slot
on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., following the established but floundering
``King of the Hill.'' If ``King of the Hill'' proves that audiences
can relate to cartoon characters, ``The PJs'' shows that animation
can breed bad comedy just as easily as live action can. &QL;

A CONDUCTOR WITH A SOUL MATCHED TO BALANCHINE'S 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: With BALLANTINE-BALLET) 
(mk) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Balanchine once said that music was the floor
that dancers dance on. Hugo Fiorato, the principal conductor of the
City Ballet Orchestra, said he agreed, particularly in the case of
the Balanchine repertory.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his ballets,'' said Fiorato, who is 84 and joined the
company in its first year, ``suddenly what you hear becomes visual
and terribly exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The choreographer also rescued much music from obscurity,
Fiorato said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balanchine made certain pieces of Stravinsky's be possible to
listen to,'' he said. ``Take `Movements for Piano and Orchestra.'
No one ever plays `Movements' in concert. But it comes alive when
you see the added dimension, as if he took the score and added
another score to it, making it not only exciting but palatable.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiorato also delights in Balanchine's eclectic musical taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have dreamt of taking Sousa marches and making a
ballet of them?'' he said, speaking of ``Stars and Stripes.''
</P>
<P>
   City Ballet has an unusually wide-ranging musical repertory. And
dance conducting in general requires a special approach to scores.
Wise ballet conductors, Fiorato said, do their homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must go to rehearsals and class to see what the body can
and cannot do,'' he said. ``It's so important to know what gravity
can do, for example. A tall dancer like Jacques d'Amboise takes
longer to go up and come down. Edward Villella was shorter and
quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Balanchine choreograph helped, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like watching an automobile being put together. You
could understand the complexity of the whole thing.''

ANTIQUES: METAMORPHIC FURNITURE _ MUCH MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In Modernism, form is supposed to follow function. In
antiques, form often hides function, which is much more fun.
</P>
<P>
   This year some dealers at the 45th annual Winter Antiques Show,
which opens Jan. 15 at the 7th Regiment Armory, on Park Avenue and
66th Street, will be selling rare examples of metamorphic
furniture, pieces with two distinct functions, one of which is
usually disguised in the other. For example, the Manhattan gallery
L'Antiquaire and the Connoisseur Inc. will be exhibiting a
34-inch-wide ``tavolo-scrivania'' made in Venice around 1760. It is
a card table that turns into a desk when you push the top of the
table back and pull the next layer forward; a reading stand pops
up, with inkwells on the side and drawers underneath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mechanical tables were extremely rare then, especially ones
made in Venice this early,'' said Helen Fioratti, president of the
gallery. ``You have to remember, this is the century of charm and
amusement. Think of Casanova. This table is a fine example of the
kind of things that interested people then.''
</P>
<P>
   The table is walnut, with cabriole legs. The top is inlaid with
marquetry fruitwood and bone, depicting the Three Graces. It costs
$105,000.
</P>
<P>
   The table is not much smaller than a famous metamorphic desk
made in Italy for Napoleon's sister, Elisa Bonaparte, which is now
at Fontainebleau. Elisa was the Hillary Clinton of her day:
intelligent, educated and strong willed. Madeleine Deschamps, a
furniture expert, wrote in her book ``Empire'' (Abbeville, 1994)
that after Elisa married Felix Bacciochi, a Corsican officer,
Napoleon made her Princess of Lucca. Later she became Grand Duchess
of Tuscany, and, Ms. Deschamps wrote, ``she showed much interest in
the economic development of both those states, energetically
improving the legislation and administration as well as the
hospital system.''
</P>
<P>
   The London craftsman David Linley discussed Elisa's desk in his
book ``Extraordinary Furniture'' (Reed Books, 1996). He wrote that
the desk was designed by Giovanni Socci of Florence (1807-39), a
leading cabinetmaker of the Empire style, to look like a plain oval
mahogany commode with saber legs and a marble top. In fact, the
``drawers'' on the front are the back of a chair. When they are
drawn back, out comes a three-legged chair.
</P>
<P>
   Viscount Linley wrote: ``When the chair is pulled out, the
central leg has to slide through a groove in the main central
platform, and so is of a simpler turned shape than the other two.
The marble top is made in two halves, which part to reveal a
leather-covered writing slope and a small writing box that pops up
and takes stationery, ink and pens.''
</P>
<P>
   Elisa liked the desk so much that she took it with her into
exile after the fall of Napoleon. Her daughter Napoleone inherited
it, as did Napoleon III later on, and it finally became part of the
French National Collections.
</P>
<P>
   Dual-purpose furniture probably started in ancient times, when
someone created a table by placing a board on two sawhorses. In the
Middle Ages and through the 17th century, the English made oak
chair-tables, sometimes called monk's chairs. In these pieces, the
armchair back pivots so that it can be lowered to become a table.
</P>
<P>
   Metamorphic furniture became particularly fashionable in England
during the Regency period (1805-25). At the armory show, the
Kentshire Galleries, a Manhattan dealer in English antiques, is
selling, for $24,000, a mahogany library chair, circa 1815, with
scrolled arms, a leaf-carved back splat with a lion's mask, and an
ebonized crest rail. The chair back tilts backward on hinges to
become a set of library steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most pieces of dual-function furniture were commissioned for
private libraries,'' said Robert Ballinger, the manager of the
Philadelphia antiques shop Alfred Bullard Inc., another exhibitor
at the armory show. ``Books were rare. After Englishmen went on
their grand tour, they built libraries to showcase their knowledge
and wealth. With the advent of the library came the ladder chair,
the ladder stool and ladder pole: all means to reach the upper
tiers of the bookcases.''
</P>
<P>
   Metamorphic furniture was also meant to be fun. ``These were
toys for rich men,'' Ballinger said. ``They were costly when they
were made. They were always of the finest materials and
craftsmanship, because only the rich had libraries. I have never
seen a library chair in a secondary wood or done with second-rate
craftsmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Newman, owner of Newel Art Galleries, a Manhattan
to-the-trade dealer that is not in the armory show, said he had
several metamorphic antiques in stock, including two revolving
bookcases, 27 inches square, that can be used as lecterns, and a
pair of what he called ``pote'' tables, 19th-century hollow
mahogany fluted columns that can be used as pedestals or opened up
for storage. The pair costs $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Newman also said he had a Regency library table with a top that
folded up and becomes a ladder and a pole you can hold on to as you
mount the steps. This costs $60,000. He said these and some 20,000
other items can be seen at his Web site, www.newel.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's New York has a sale of English furniture Jan. 22 that
includes a William IV library table-steps with gilt-tooled leather
inset steps (estimate: $12,000 to $15,000) and a brass-bound and
leather-covered library pole-ladder (estimate: $3,000 to $5,000).
</P>
<P>
   The French were masters at hybrid furniture designs. Dalva
Brothers, a Manhattan gallery that specializes in French antiques,
has several, including a rare bonheur-du-jour, a lady's writing
desk ingeniously fitted with compartments, that has been owned by
an array of Americans (Joseph C. Widener, John L. Severence, the
Cleveland Museum and John Dorrance, the founder of Campbell's
Soup).
</P>
<P>
   The desk, by the leading Paris cabinetmaker Pierre Rousel, is
Transitional Period, between Louis XV and XVI. It starts as a
writing table with a hinged central panel that lifts backward. A
mirror flips up, and the piece becomes a poudreuse, or dressing
table. It compresses a lot of storage areas into a minimal space,
while remaining quintessentially feminine. It costs $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   Apartment dwellers who can't afford a guest room will like the
18th-century beds hidden in pieces of furniture. ``Beds in the form
of bookcases, writing desks, cupboards and sideboards were probably
found in many well-to-do homes,'' Viscount Linley wrote in his
book. ``The inventory made of Madame de Pompadour's possessions
mentions three.''
</P>
<P>
   His favorite is a commode bed designed about 1780 by the Swedish
cabinetmaker Georg Haupt. The entire front slides out from the
back, extending like a telescope. Folding legs swing down to
support the mattress, which is rolled up inside. The bed was made
for the private bedroom of Gustavus III of Sweden, as a place for
his page-bodyguard to sleep. The king was assassinated anyway, in
1792, but at least it wasn't in his bedroom. Come to think of it,
that commode bed could be useful in a lot of situations.

BRUCE DAVIDSON: WHEN TROUBLE WAS HARDER TO FIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``What it used to wind up is, nobody was tough. We
were all tough, but nobody was the toughest, although we knew which
guys in the gang were tougher.'' These confounding words come from
Bengie, one of the few surviving members of the Jokers, the gang of
teen-agers that Bruce Davidson photographed in the summer of 1959.
In an exhibition of 50 of Davidson's black and white Brooklyn
photographs at the International Center of Photography, you can see
exactly what Bengie means.
</P>
<P>
   The gang members Davidson photographed were 15, 16 and 17 years
old, innocent and trying hard not to be. Some were tougher than
others, but there was a limit to how much trouble they could find
that year. Their home turf was the corner of Eighth Avenue and 17th
Street in Brooklyn, but they also hung out in Prospect Park,
Helen's Candy store, subway cars, sandwich shops and under the
Coney Island boardwalk, showing off their hair, their sunglasses,
their cigarettes, their tattoos and their girls.
</P>
<P>
   One series of photographs chronicles a going-away party for a
gang member. (Bengie explains in the exhibition catalog that there
was always some Joker who was about to join the Army.) Everyone at
the party is neatly dressed in paisleys, argyles, stripes and
khakis. Gang members are sitting quietly, swing dancing and slow
dancing around a radiator pole in someone's basement. In every
photograph there is the same childish backdrop _ white wallpaper
with fairy-tale horses, queens, knights, marionettes and jokers.
(Could that be the origin of the gang's name?)
</P>
<P>
   The innocence, alas, didn't last. Many of the kids Davidson
photographed that summer are dead now, according to Bengie, who is
now a 55-year-old drug counselor. One of them overdosed, another
cracked his head when he was drunk, another put a gun in her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The strange thing about the pictures is that there is hardly a
hint of impending crisis: no drugs, no violence. If the Jokers
looked like dead-end kids back then, now they look like sweet
representatives of a lost era, lazing in the soft twilight of 1959.
You could almost envy them, if you didn't know where they were
headed.
</P>
<P>
   In the catalog for the show, Bengie described his friends.
Junior was a Romeo who ``walked around with a copy of Ginsberg's
`Howl' in his back pocket.'' Cathy, his girlfriend, was ``beautiful
like Brigitte Bardot.'' Lefty had a tattoo of a skunk. Jimmie
looked like James Dean and was always working on cars.
</P>
<P>
   Bengie is the one with the hard cheekbones and a black jacket
with woven trim. Sometimes he wears a paisley shirt. His fingers
are long and delicate. And he always looks mad. One photograph
catches him scowling under a Pepsi thermometer, his hot teen-age
face looking like a ball of mercury ready to blast up to 120
degrees. But the sign above him undermines his foul mood: ``Have a
Pepsi.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, who has also done photographic essays on Los Angeles,
England and Scotland, Central Park, Welsh miners, East 100th Street
in New York and the life of a circus dwarf in New Jersey, was just
25 and the youngest member of the Magnum photo agency when he met
the Jokers. His connection to the gang was a member of the Youth
Board assigned to watch over them after a rumble in Prospect Park.
</P>
<P>
   So why isn't there any violence in sight? One photograph
suggests an answer. It is a dark rainy day. Two teen-agers walk
quickly by a church as bright, blurry statues of Jesus and Mary
look on. One of the boys wears sunglasses and seems to clutch his
shirt to his neck. The other has hands clasped in front with a
jacket pulled over his head. Bengie's words explain what is going
on: `We were all Catholic school kids. Some of us got thrown out,
but it didn't stop our families. We still had to go to Mass on
Sunday. And the statue with the Christ on the cross and the Blessed
Mother, every time we passed that, no matter what, we would bless
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   They felt watched. Whether it was the Virgin Mary, Helen, the
candy store owner or a grandmother frowning at the window, someone
was always looking on. In one photograph Helen stands in her apron,
arm in arm with the gang members outside her candy store. They are
all smiling, squinting in the sunlight, and well dressed, patiently
waiting for the shutter. Even one of Davidson's subway shots of a
teen-ager smoking alone with his legs up on the seat suggests a
parental eye. Above the smoking boy is a poster of a man and a
woman smoking Kent Filters. He could be their son, his main act of
rebellion an overhand grip on his cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   It is a testament to Davidson's eye that his photographs, though
they are not labeled with Jokers' names, invite a particular kind
of watchful intimacy. You find yourself trying to follow the
characters from shot to shot, isolating the detail that makes each
kid easy to spot.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That guy with the skunk tattoo also has a chain with a silver
disk dangling from it. That's the same guy with his tongue sticking
out in the air shaft and smoking. And that's him spinning on a bar
that connects one building to another. There he is lying in the
sand with a girl. But is that him making out with a girl in the
back seat of a car or not? Where did his chain go?
</P>
<P>
   There is a blonde girl fixing her hair in the mirror of a
cigarette machine while a boy near her rolls up his sleeves. You
can see her again in an overhead shot near the Coney Island
boardwalk holding a gap-toothed comb. Doesn't she care about
anything but her hair? There she is lying in the sand with her
boyfriend. They look happy. But, wait, on the bus back from the
beach she is between two men. One has his head buried in her
shoulder. The other, the makeout-guy with a tattoo of a cupid,
looks angry. Did they have an argument?
</P>
<P>
   What Davidson captures so well is that teen-age urgency, the
sense that all these details _ the part in the hair, the length of
the fingernails, the jacket trim, the cigarette grip _ matter
greatly. Looking at these sweet and wistful photographs, it seems
more than likely that Davidson's watchful eye made the kids more
ingenuous than they ever wanted to look. In the one shot where the
photographer himself is caught hanging out with the Jokers in
Prospect Park, you can see a gang member with his two tattoos
stealing an admiring glimpse at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce Davidson: The Brooklyn Gang 1959'' remains at the
International Center of Photography, 1130 Fifth Ave., at 94th
Street, through March 7.

`THE AMERICAN JEW:' FROM SITTING BULL TO DIAMOND MERCHANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Provocative but not profound, strident but not
subtle, and eclectic without being embracing, ``The American Jew''
takes on a complex subject that exceeds its blinkered vision.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Tuvia Tenenbom as a production of his
Jewish Theater of New York, this stage piece, performed by a single
actor, presents a series of portraits based on interviews. On that
basis, ``The American Jew,'' in the words of its publicity, lays
claim to being a show that ``exposes the real face of American Jews
in the most honest way possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Technique is one thing; adequate sampling is another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some American Jews'' might be a title more suited to the
limited population on view at the Judith Anderson Theater. Because
most of the depictions are unflattering, the show's suggestion that
the question of who is a Jew outweighs the answer seems more artful
than artistic.
</P>
<P>
   Tenenbom's characters, portrayed in alternating performances by
Catherine Curtin and Victor Attar, declare themselves on a stage
whose looming backdrop is a nude, the eternal blond gentile
temptress, arranged somewhat more revealingly than Ingres'
``Odalisque.''
</P>
<P>
   These characters range from Sitting Bull, a descendant of the
Hebrew lost tribes, to a Hasidic diamond merchant who can justify
selling a $100 engagement ring for $10,000 to a naive couple in
Manhattan's diamond market, to Charles Smith III, an immensely
wealthy but selectively uncharitable Jewish investment banker whose
prescription for success lies in changing names to those less
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Jew'' also sends up the confused
Reconstructionist American Jew and portrays the Racist American
Jew, clearly based on Rabbi Meir Kahane; the Agnostic American Jew;
the Atheist American, and the American Jewess, who turns out to be
a ditzy convert from Mormonism.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the characters resemble cartoons. The men
tend to be womanizers, and the comedy is childish.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Curtin delivers a game performance, but the characters
portrayed in their own words in ``The American Jew'' aren't
playwrights. They remain characters in search of an eloquent
author.

CASTING FOLK ART TO THE WINDS THE WHITNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Whitney Museum of American Art is selling a group
of 23 folk art paintings from the 19th century, which were given to
the institution in the late 1960s by Edgar William Garbisch and his
wife, Bernice Chrysler Garbisch. The paintings are expected to sell
for $400,000 to $600,000 and will be auctioned at Sotheby's in New
York on Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Haus, the Whitney's director of communications, said the
sale was ``yet another stage in a process of deaccessioning
non-20th-century objects that either don't fall within or are not
essential to the Whitney's collecting mandate, which is
20th-century American art.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to concentrate on 20th-century American art, and
particularly living American artists, was made in 1980 when the
Whitney was re-examining itself in its 50th year. Thomas Armstrong
was the museum's director then.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Haus said the decision to sell most of the Garbisch gift was
made at a board meeting in February 1997, when David Ross was the
director. But it is a decision the museum's new director, Maxwell
Anderson, supports, Ms. Haus said. The choice of what to sell was
based on recommendations from outside scholars hired to evaluate
the collection. Proceeds from the sale will go into the Whitney's
acquisitions fund, to strengthen its 20th-century holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney is keeping one painting from the Garbisch
collection, A. Logan's ``Circus'' from 1874, because the museum has
the famous Calder mobile, ``Circus,'' in its permanent collection
and occasionally does exhibitions exploring this theme.
</P>
<P>
   Garbisch is a magical name to seasoned collectors. The couple,
who divided their time between Manhattan, Palm Beach and the
Maryland shore, both died in 1979. After their marriage in 1930,
they devoted their lives to philanthropy and collecting. and
amassed a world-class group of American naive paintings, all
bequeathed to museums, including the National Gallery of Art in
Washington as well as the Whitney. They also had an outstanding
collection of American antiques, 18th-century French furniture,
export porcelains and Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and modern
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Garbisch was a former chairman of the Grocery Store Products
Company. Mrs. Garbisch was the daughter of Walter Chrysler, founder
of the Chrysler Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the early 1970s, there were a series of auctions of
Garbisch material, culminating in several landmark sales in the
early 1980s. These included paintings, furniture and decorative
objects auctioned at Pokety Farms, the couple's Maryland home, and
at what was then Sotheby Parke Bernet on Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The sale at Sotheby's this month will include such choice folk
art paintings as a whimsical representation of Adam and Eve that
shows Eve feeding a fawn with Adam looking on adoringly (circa
1830). The work is expected to sell for between $25,000 and
$35,000. ``Picking Apples'' (circa 1830), with a girl, a boy and
their mother beneath a large tree, is expected to bring between
$20,000 and $30,000. There are several important folk portraits,
including ``Jeremiah H. York and His Sister'' (1853), by William
Matthew Prior, with an estimate of between $20,000 and $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Druckman, Sotheby's director of American folk art, said
that today ``one would be hard-pressed to put together a group of
paintings of this consistency and critical mass.'' Folk art
collectors will be serious bidders, she said, but added that
museums might try their luck, too. ``More and more institutions,''
she said, ``have major representations in this field.'' From the
Heart, to Haiti
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Sacred Arts of Haitian Vodou'' opened Oct. 10 at the
American Museum of Natural History, visitors have been tossing
money and other offerings _ like cigarettes, Metrocards and flowers
_ in front of the show's re-created altars. By the time the show
closed Sunday , more than $2,300 had been accumulated from the
161,359 visitors. The museum has given it to the Haiti Disaster
Relief Fund, based in New York, which coordinates help from the New
York metropolitan area for Haitians left homeless by Hurricane
Georges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this was a show about aspects of Haitian culture and it
was supported by many Haitian groups in New York, it just made
sense to give back to them,'' said Holly Evarts, a spokeswoman for
the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Housewarming Present
</P>
<P>
   More than 125 works have been given to the permanent collection
of the Museum of American Folk Art, in anticipation of its $25
million new building on West 53rd Street, which will quadruple the
museum's exhibition space when it opens in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 75 paintings and sculptures by contemporary
self-taught artists was given by Anne Hill Blanchard, a trustee,
and her husband, Edward Vermont Blanchard Jr. It is the largest
gift of 20th-century art to the museum. Two other trustees, Cyril
Irwin Nelson and David Davies, also gave works, including
19th-century paintings, furniture and textiles.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has also received $1 million from the Peter Jay Sharp
Foundation and an additional pledge of $750,000 from the trustees
Barbara and John Wilkerson.

   NEW YORK _ At first glance ``Electra'' looked like a money loser
par excellence. The subject matter was grim; the cast had no naked
Hollywood stars, and the playwright hadn't written a play in 2,400
years.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, the producers of Sophocles' revenge tragedy
proudly announced that they had recouped all of the show's initial
$600,000 investment at the Barrymore Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stunned,'' said Eric Krebs, one of the producers. ``It's
probably more money than the entire community of Greek playwrights
made in 450 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In Broadway terms, $600,000 is tiny. But still, how the
production returned its investment in barely six weeks, including
two weeks of previews, is a lesson in micromanaging, penny-pinching
and luck.
</P>
<P>
   Krebs said he cut costs at every opportunity, including using
the costumes and set from the play's production last fall at the
McCarter Theater in Princeton, N.J. He even used the same
production photographs, saving about $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The producers, who include Randall Wheghitt, Anita Waxman and
Elizabeth Williams, also asked the cast to perform for ``modest''
salaries, said Krebs, adding that those salaries would increase.
Frank McGuiness, the play's adapter, also accepted reduced
royalties until costs were recouped and will now receive a raise.
This in turn will increase the show's low weekly running cost, now
about $140,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the central factor in the show's success was the buzz
surrounding the production, ignited by fine reviews and fed by a
dearth of highbrow fare on Broadway. The plan to recoup was based
on selling 70 percent capacity through Jan. 17, the original
closing date. Instead, ``we're running 95 percent, and we're
extending into March,'' Krebs said.
</P>
<P>
   For the many producers who passed on ``Electra,'' its success
proves an ancient maxim of theater: You never can tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't go around betting on Greek tragedy,'' said Roger
Berlind, a producer who opted not to take on the play. ``But now
that I think about it, I'm an idiot for not doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Back So Soon?
</P>
<P>
   Natasha Richardson had absolutely, positively no intention of
coming to Broadway this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept asking me, and I kept saying no,'' she said. ``After
six months in `Cabaret,' I was so emotionally and physically
exhausted, I just said `I can't go back into a theater.'''
</P>
<P>
   But in two weeks Ms. Richardson, who won a Tony last year in
``Cabaret,'' will begin rehearsal for ``Closer,'' Patrick Marber's
play about four strangers who become sexually intertwined. It opens
on March 28 at the Music Box Theater. She plays Anna, a
photographer.
</P>
<P>
   Why the change of heart? ``This material wouldn't leave me
alone,'' she said. ``As an actor, you choose the stuff that makes
your hair stand on end. With this, I got the frisson.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting that frisson took a while. About six weeks ago she told
Marber for the third time that she wouldn't take the role. ``I put
down the phone and knew in my gut I was wrong,'' she said. ``I
called back and said, `I'm so sorry, can I do it?'''
</P>
<P>
   Marber agreed. ``The character has to be intelligent and funny
and beautiful and slightly _ what's the word? _ soulful and
slightly sad,'' he said. ``That's Natasha.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading North
</P>
<P>
   ``Snakebit'' apparently is not.
</P>
<P>
   The well-received play by David Marshall Grant is moving to the
Century Center for the Performing Arts. Performances begin on Feb.
16.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of ``Snakebit,'' which is about three friends
dealing with the repercussions of an affair, surprised the
playwright. ``I did not expect it, the way I did not expect the
president to be impeached or the Dow to reach 10,000,'' Grant said.
``I'm just a bad prognosticator.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls Won't Be Boys
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who has seen a David Mamet play knows he likes his men
to be men (even if they're jerks). But one small theater company
recently got a reminder of this.
</P>
<P>
   The all-female Quintessential Theater Company, based in
Brooklyn, had planned a three-night run this weekend of Mamet
monologues at the Limelight nightclub, packaging the performances
as ``Mamet Bare.'' Many of the monologues were written for men but
were to be performed by women. Still, the company applied and
received rights to perform the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   But about three weeks ago Dramatists Play Service and Samuel
French Inc., the publishing houses that issue contracts for the
performance rights to Mamet's work, withdrew the permission for all
the pieces written for men. The reason? A standing request from
Mamet against gender bending.
</P>
<P>
   Mamet's agent, Howard Rosenstone, said his client was within his
rights to refuse such performances, as they constitute an
unauthorized alteration of his work. Still, the action took the
company by surprise. ``We love his work,'' said Natasha Borg, a
company member. ``We didn't want to do plays with women sitting on
rugs, drinking wine and talking about baby showers.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for both Samuel French and Dramatists said they
were not aware, when the rights were granted, that the company had
planned to change the gender of the characters. ``They did mention
the group was five women, but they hadn't mentioned that they were
planning an all-female cast,'' said Craig Pospisil, the director of
nonprofessional rights for Dramatists, which has since suggested
that the company perform several gender-neutral works by Mamet.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel French, meanwhile, sent a letter to the theater company's
lawyer on Wednesday formally pulling the rights to Mamet's works
and returning the company's check. Charles Van Nostrand, the
president of Samuel French, did not return calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to contact Mamet through his agent were unsuccessful,
but Rosenstone said that while the playwright liked his work being
produced, switching characters' sex was definitely off limits.
``The director can interpret the script in any way he likes,''
Rosenstone said. ``Just don't rewrite the play, and don't change
the gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Quintessential, which delayed this weekend's performance, may
still try to do a Mamet play. ``We just want to perform work that
is challenging,'' Ms. Borg said. ``And Mamet is.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kevin Wynn thinks big. True, there was a solo on the
program presented by the Kevin Wynn Collection on Wednesday night
in the ``Altogether Different'' festival at the Joyce Theater. But
that solo was performed by an outsize talent named Matthew Rushing,
a guest dancer from the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. And
dancers spilled across the stage for the rest of the evening in
what was the equivalent of a cast of thousands for scrimping
downtown dance, the population from which the Joyce series draws
most of its choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn has been thinking big for a relatively long time. His
choreography has developed, though, from exuberant physical
explosion to dance that has not slackened in pace or spirit but
that now tends to be crammed with shapes and images. If Wynn's new
``To Repel The Demons'' were film, any one frame might suggest
dancers that look like Keith Haring figures frozen in frenzied,
complex motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Repel the Demons'' was the choreographic highlight of the
evening, in part because of the support given the dance by its
score by Phillip Hamilton. Hamilton draws, as Wynn does, on
African, American jazz and modernist influences, blending them here
in music that is full of incident, one moment raucous, the next
tender or teasing. The music was performed live by a superb though
uncredited ensemble that had the audience cheering.
</P>
<P>
   To this dance blend Wynn adds the upended lifts, bodies poised
and legs working at crazy angles that are a theme in the new group
work. The 17 dancers move through unexpected clusters and
dispersals, sweeping across the stage in a tumult in which every
move, every body line is distinctly drawn. David Grill bathes the
dancers in a wash of golden, silver and coppery light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vicious Beauties,'' a new group work set to a score by Peter
Jones, is essentially a very long series of fast and slow
stage-crosses in which dancers peel off for smaller set pieces. The
even-paced music doesn't help, nor do the unflattering costumes, a
problem in general in this program.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest interest of ``Black Borealis,'' set to music by
Giovanni Sollima, is Rushing's performance. Wynn has given him
movement thick with emotional and physical complexity and sudden
shifts of pace. Rushing negotiates it all with a clarity and
simplicity that reminded one audience member of the dancing of
Mikhail Baryshnikov. Roma Flowers designed the lighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Kevin Wynn Collection will perform again on Sunday afternoon
and evening. Hamilton will perform in February at Dance Theater
Workshop.

TRAVOLTA, DUVALL TURN `CIVIL ACTION' INTO THOUGHT-PROVOKING
THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fact is invariably more compelling than fiction. Hollywood's
latest proof of that adage is ``A Civil Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   For four-fifths of its running time, it's as good _ probably
better than _ any John Grisham thriller the movies have yet
adapted.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, real-life legal situations rarely end as
dramatically or cathartically as they do in fiction, and this one
doesn't end so much as it just peters out inconclusively. It also
leaves us with several nagging unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it's one dandy legal thriller: unusually
thought-provoking, exceptionally well-acted by stars John Travolta
and Robert Duvall, and so incorrigibly gripping it simply sucks its
audience in like dust into a vacuum cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Jonathan Harr's best-selling book about an early-'80s
lawsuit, it tells the story of a well-off, ambulance-chasing Boston
personal injury lawyer (Travolta) whose small firm stumbles into a
case involving a cluster of child leukemia deaths in the small
Massachusetts town of Woburn.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he wants to blow off what he considers a vague and
unwinnable case, but after talking to the Woburn parents _ who
believe the deaths were caused by contaminated drinking water _ he
comes to believe he can prove the liability of two huge
corporations who dumped toxic waste in the area.
</P>
<P>
   His object is a big settlement, but gradually his greed gets
mixed with empathy for the victims and anger at the polluting
corporations. So, as he becomes obsessed with the case to the point
of sacrificing everything else in his life, the film gradually
becomes the story of the consciousness-raising of a shyster lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   As a morality tale, the film works wonderfully off the
performances of Travolta and Duvall (as one of the opposing
lawyers). Travolta perfectly conveys the hero's conflicting
feelings in a way that always makes his actions sympathetic and
credible, while Duvall gives a splendid portrayal of folksy
corporate evil.
</P>
<P>
   As a thriller, the film soars off the literate script and
story-telling flair of writer-director Steven Zaillian (best known
for penning the script of ``Schindler's List''). Zaillian's bold
cross-cutting flashbacks within his courtroom scenes are especially
imaginative and effective _ and make his material seem fresh and
original.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly because of the influence of co-producer Robert Redford,
``A Civil Affair'' also works as a fairly devastating environmental
muckraker. Its story enrages and scares us, and it's gutsy enough
to use the real names of its corporate heavies _ Beatrice Foods and
the W.R. Grace Co. (Grace is not happy about it, either, and denies
any guilt in the matter.)
</P>
<P>
   The rub is that because Zaillian has held himself so close to
the facts of the case, he obviously couldn't mold or compress its
climax in any way. So his film doesn't conclude with the bang we
expect from the legal thriller genre so much as it whimpers to the
kind of anti-climax that might work in a documentary, but is
naggingly unsatisfying in a drama.
</P>
<P>
   A Civil Action. Directed and written by Steven Zaillian. Cast:
John Travolta, Robert Duvall, Tony Shalhoub, William H. Macy.
Touchstone/Paramount. 110 minutes. Rated PG-13 for mature themes
and language.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+

HOME COOKING: FALCONS, JETS, VIKINGS AND BRONCOS PICKED TO WIN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; NFC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 49ers (13-4) at Falcons (14-2) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The four teams that host divisional playoff games _ Denver,
Minnesota, Atlanta and the Jets _ had an astounding 31-1 record at
home this year. That of course bodes well for the Falcons in their
game against San Francisco. This is the 39th time since 1970 that
NFL teams have met three times in a season, but it is the first
playoff game ever between the 49ers and Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams are explosive, with four of the two teams' wideouts
ranked among the top seven in conference receiving yards. But this
game will be won on the ground. During the regular-season game in
Atlanta, the Falcons' NFC best rush defense held the 49ers to only
76 yards on the ground _ and that was with a healthy Garrison
Hearst. He is listed as questionable this week with a severe
hamstring injury, and he also has a sore calf. He wasn't a major
factor in San Francisco's victory over Green Bay last week.
</P>
<P>
   The game will be close because the 49ers are battle-tested _ the
last time they got nervous in a playoff game was, well, never. The
49ers have the league's second best playoff record of all time with
24 wins. But the Falcons win because they are faster than the 49ers
on offense and defense, and running back Jamal Anderson gets 130
yards on 25 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons, 30-20.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cardinals (10-7) at Vikings (15-1) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If the Vikings are nervous about being so heavily favored
against Arizona, they aren't showing it. Coach Dennis Green has
been cool all week, and his players have talked about how confident
they are. No one is cocky _ it is just that winning 15 games does
wonders for a team.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing seems to faze the Vikings when they are at home, where
they went 8-0. This team is built for speed and artificial turf,
which is why not only did Minnesota score a league-record 556
points, but an opportunistic defense helped the Vikings gain their
plus-14 turnover ratio.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are playing the team-of-destiny role, and are
light on their feet because they know they have nothing to lose.
But Arizona just does not match up well with the Vikings.
Cornerback Aeneas Williams will likely lock up on wide receiver
Randy Moss, and that's a good matchup, but how does Arizona stop
the other cannon? Besides Moss, there is Cris Carter, a healthy
Jake Reed, and wide receiver Matthew Hatchette, who has 15 catches
for 216 yards in his last four games. Then, if the Air Force
stalls, Minnesota goes to the ground with Robert Smith. It is one
thing for the Cardinals to beat up on an old and gimpy Dallas team,
but the Vikings are hungry, fast, and relentless. This one won't be
close.
</P>
<P>
   Vikings, 40-14
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dolphins (11-6) at Broncos (14-2) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When these two teams met in December, the Dolphins won, 31-21,
but the game was in Miami. Quarterback Dan Marino threw for 355
yards and four touchdowns in only his second meeting with Elway.
Different day, different locale, which means a different result.
Denver has won 17 straight at Mile High Stadium and have scored
over 30 points a game in 13 of their past 16 home games.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos were frustrated by how Miami's defense completely
shut down their offense, or were they? Privately, coaches who have
played the Broncos within the last month maintain that Denver has
stripped its offense down to the basics. Why would the Broncos do
that? Coach Mike Shanahan hasn't wanted to reveal anything before
the playoffs, and when Denver locked up home field advantage
throughout the postseason, he figured why risk giving away strategy
unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan is one of the smartest strategists in football, and
he's had time to pick apart Miami's defense. He will be at home,
where he is 31-3. And the Broncos' wide receivers are already
excited because Dolphins defensive backs are saying that Denver's
wide receivers weren't the best they have faced all year. Not a
smart move.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos, 26-10
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jaguars (12-5) at Jets (12-5) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   What happens when two best friends face each other in the
playoffs? Jacksonville Coach Tom Coughlin was wide receivers coach
under Bill Parcells when both were at the Giants from 1988-90,
winning Super Bowl XXV. The two men are buddies, but that does not
mean they don't want to beat each other.
</P>
<P>
   The key to this game is Jaguars quarterback Mark Brunell, who
missed most of December with a high ankle sprain and was rusty last
week against New England. Instead of running on that plush grass at
home, he'll be scrambling on cold, hard artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   Expect the Jets to duplicate the plan the Patriots tried _ blitz
Brunell constantly. The Jets want Brunell to scramble _ because of
that ankle. The Jets' offense will easily move the ball against a
mediocre Jacksonville defense, but this will be a high scoring game
because the Jets don't have enough defensive studs, especially on
the line, to stop rookie running back Fred Taylor, who is on a
roll.
</P>
<P>
   Jets, 28-23.

A PICTURE OF 17TH CENTURY DOMESTIC BLISS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Attn: The Netherlands, England, Conn.) 
(DW) 
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mother delousing her child's hair may not be the most
appealing subject, but the Dutch painter Pieter de Hooch
(1629-1684) saw it as a labor of love. In ``A Mother and Child With
Its Head in Her Lap'' (1658-60) he conjures up a convincing scene
of domestic felicity.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is not unfamiliar in Dutch painting; combs and
hair-cleaning symbolized godliness, and earlier artists had
depicted delousing scenes. But de Hooch (pronounced de-HOAK)
brought it home, so to speak, creates a ``real'' setting carefully
anchored in specifics. A well-dressed mother dexterously plows her
kneeling child's scalp in a room whose properties are seen in
exquisite detail, from beamed ceiling to mellow tiled floor.
</P>
<P>
   Sunlight pours through a doorway leading to a smaller chamber,
whose open window presents an outdoor view. The light casts a
precise pattern on the floor between the doorway and the window.
Also coming from a high window at right, it brings alive the
texture of the striped bed curtains flanked by a brass bed warmer
on the wall beside them. A small pooch (pronounced POOCH) _ dogs
are a staple of de Hooch paintings _ is silhouetted in the doorway.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is, in short, a cozy one in which the intimate details
of domestic life and the play of light and color on surfaces and
textures give the viewer the sense of a comfortable, nonthreatening
world in which all is as it should be. Like the best of de Hooch's
Delft period, the painting conveys the solid values of prosperous
Dutch burgherhood: tidiness, both moral and physical; tranquillity
and, not least important, substantial mothering skills. Perhaps,
too, the aftermath of the Thirty Years' War (1618-48), in which the
Netherlands was engaged, encouraged an audience for an art of peace
and domestic harmony.
</P>
<P>
   De Hooch did not invent genre painting, but he literally gave it
a new dimension. Space and perspective played roles as charged as
color in his work; one of his favorite devices is that of a dark
foreground with an open door leading into a brightly lighted second
space that in turn reveals another view. Although skilled in the
use of mathematical perspective, he was also adept at creating a
sense of it by the time-honored use of color, light and atmospheric
effects. Small wonder that he was considered a star of the Delft
School, outshone only by his contemporary Johannes Vermeer
(1632-75).
</P>
<P>
   Yet the show at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Conn.,
through Feb. 28, simply titled ``Pieter de Hooch, 1629-84,'' is the
first retrospective ever given to this masterly recorder of
everyday life. It was organized by Desmond Shawe-Taylor, director
of the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London, and Peter C. Sutton,
director of the Wadsworth Atheneum, a de Hooch scholar who produced
the catalog raisonne of his work in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In 40 or so paintings, the artist's development is tracked from
early renditions of soldiers disporting in taverns and guard rooms
through the atmospheric interiors and courtyards of his Delft
period to the elegant but stilted and sometimes bizarre canvases he
turned out after moving to Amsterdam. But the work done in Delft is
far and away the best.
</P>
<P>
   De Hooch's biography is short on facts, long on supposition. He
was born in Rotterdam, the son of a bricklayer and a professional
midwife. He probably studied in Haarlem with the Italianate
landscape painter Nicolaes Berchem (1620-83), was married and left
in 1652 for Delft, where he seems to have worked as both a painter
and a servant for a linen merchant. In 1655 he joined the artists'
guild there (which Vermeer later led), moved to Amsterdam between
1660-61 and died in a madhouse at the age of 55.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is known about his relationship with Vermeer, with whose
work his own shared many traits. Even scholars are hard put to say
who influenced whom; occasionally they have had trouble telling
their works apart. The two artists were in Delft at the same time,
but whether they knew each other is not certain. Yet they must have
been aware of each other's paintings. If de Hooch's palette is
warmer than Vermeer's and he uses more complex perspective systems
and multiple sources of light, Vermeer's subjects are more subtly
portrayed, compositionally more harmonious and convey a sense of
enigma foreign to de Hooch's straight-on approach.
</P>
<P>
   De Hooch started out in a cliched Dutch genre tradition, doing
scenes of soldiers and peasants carousing in barrooms and barracks,
including ``A Seated Soldier With a Standing Serving Woman''
(1652-55). A tavern vignette, it depicts a soldier wearing a
broad-brimmed hat and armored chest protector sitting with his back
to the viewer in front of a woman who raises a tall glass of beer.
In the shadowy background two men play cards on a military drum.
The interior space is shallow, and there's not much evidence of the
artist's later achievements, save for the careful attention given
to rendering surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   By 1655 he had produced one of the first of his Delft interiors,
``Mother and Child With a Servant Woman Sweeping'' (1655-57). A
mother sits near a fireplace with a dozing infant in her lap
watching the sweeper. Leaded windows above give a view of a tiled
roof. A lighted doorway leads to a back room, but the perspective
is somewhat distorted. Still, it represents a better attempt to
create receding pictorial space than the tavern scenes.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1658, Sutton writes, de Hooch had created ``a new type of
genre painting with unprecedented spatial order and naturalism.''
He had not left the drinking themes behind but now they, like his
domestic scenes _ peopled mostly by women, children and servants _
were set in respectable courtyards, interiors and gardens, with
well-ordered, psychologically pleasing progressions of spaces.
</P>
<P>
   One highlight of the show, from the fertile year 1658, is a
painting that brings into play all de Hooch's special talents: his
brilliant use of perspective and his great skills at conveying
light, color and surfaces. It depicts the courtyard of a brick
house in Delft, with two women and a child. One of the women
stands, back to the viewer, in a narrow arched passageway framed in
brick that gives at the far end a glimpse of another building. The
other woman leads a little girl down a low flight of steps out of a
crude wooden shed that abuts the archway. The courtyard floor is
neatly paved in yellow bricks that complement the red bricks of the
arch; a patch of blue sky and the top of a tree appear over the
shed.
</P>
<P>
   In this startlingly structured picture, the eye is caught up in
a lively bustle of doorways and other architectural framings, open
and closed spaces and wood and brick surfaces that the figures
vividly animate. The artist's game seems to be how much you can
pack into a painting and still make it read. The multiple
architectural elements of the busy canvas, done in two-point
perspective, are nearly all fictitious, yet their artful assemblage
gives the impression of repertorial accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The painting is paired in the show with one done at the same
time using a very similar architectural composition but a different
orchestration; for example, the shed on the right has given way to
an arbor in which two men and a woman are drinking. But all the
varied elements of color, texture, space and light are there again,
and this painting, so much the same and yet so different, is no
less a smash than the first.
</P>
<P>
   Around 1661, with the decline of Delft as an art center, de
Hooch _like many other artists _ moved with his family to arriviste
Amsterdam, the prosperous banking center of northern Europe. There,
his style changed again, and not for the better. A foppish elegance
descended on his paintings; the interiors became ornate, the
figures elongated, almost Mannerist in style, and an atmosphere of
overripe luxury prevailed. Compare the plain but elegant portrait
of a Delft clan he did in 1657-60 with his 1670 account of a
wealthy merchant's family in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   The first is a beautifully orchestrated view of three
generations dressed in their somber Sunday best but informally
assembled in an airy courtyard with a backdrop of city buildings.
It is the largest of de Hooch's works and is, in short, a
masterpiece. But the Amsterdam family, a group of stiff and oddly
distorted figures garbed in sumptuous finery, is deployed in a
stilted arrangement in a stuffy manorial room, the only
real-looking body in it that of a squirming dog.
</P>
<P>
   De Hooch also used Amsterdam's grandiose new City Hall as a
setting for invented compositions, including family groups involved
in such pastimes as music-making. He pursued his old themes of card
players and merrymakers along with domestic interiors. But many of
these paintings, while virtuoso in performance, come off as rather
stale stereotypes lacking the magical sweetness and simplicity of
his work in Delft.
</P>
<P>
   With its well-assembled group of paintings from important
lenders all over the world, this one-and-only show is in itself
something of a masterpiece, highly instructive and a lot of fun
besides. Its impressive catalog gives a good reading of the social,
economic and political climate of the times. Too bad it won't come
to New York, but Hartford's not very far.

`SOME VOICES': AN OMELET STEALS THE SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The most intriguing thing about ``Some Voices'' is a
mushroom omelet. It's prepared onstage by Max Baker at the
conclusion of the two-hour play, and the actor makes such a
pleasant production of the chopping, sauteeing and whisking that
you find yourself more engrossed in his labors than in virtually
anything else that happens all evening.
</P>
<P>
   The cooking eggs give off the aroma of authenticity, which
otherwise is missing much of the time in the New Group staging of
Joe Penhall's play about a high-spirited, mentally ill young man
fighting his biochemical impulses for a life of some emotional
suppleness.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the working-class precincts of contemporary London _ the
backdrop of choice for the Anglophiliac New Group, producers of
``Ecstasy,'' ``Curtains'' and ``Goose-Pimples'' _ ``Some Voices''
follows the progress of hapless, manic Ray (Jamie Harris), who upon
release from a psychiatric hospital moves in with his brother, Pete
(Baker), and strikes up a friendship with troubled, pregnant Laura
(Ana Reeder), who is regularly beaten by her boyfriend, Dave (David
Thornton).
</P>
<P>
   The play, which opened Thursday night at the Playhouse at St.
Clement's Church, is the sort of earnest English drama that
presents urban life as unrelentingly gray as an English winter day.
Ray's losing struggle against a disability purposefully kept vague
provides the loose framework for a story that also touches on the
unhappy existences of Pete, divorced and working as a chef, and
Laura, drinking and smoking her way through a pregnancy she insists
she really wants.
</P>
<P>
   But their problems don't sustain a thinly plotted work that
contains few interesting twists or surprises: A violent
confrontation between Dave and Ray, for example, is foretold the
moment Thornton shoots his first menacing glance at Harris. And the
central relationship, between the frustrated Pete and his
uncomprehending, failure-prone brother, never hits the tender note
that seems intended. When in the end Pete gives Ray, lost in the
haze of medication, the omelet cooking lesson, Pete's reaching out
in the way he knows best has no poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pugliese's direction exhibits no feel for this place or
these characters. (A scene in which Ray douses himself with
gasoline and brandishes a cigarette lighter is shocking only
because it is staged with no sense of imminent threat.) The set by
Kevin Price, a few sticks of furniture surrounded on three sides by
screens onto which street scenes and interiors are projected, is
drably on target, but Tom Kochan's original music, with its Celtic
influence, sounds as if it was meant for a play set far west of
West London, in, say, Galway or Connemara.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell McGuire has the thankless and wholly superfluous task
of playing a delusional hospital escapee given to weird prophecies.
Harris and Ms. Reeder are serviceable as the erratic hero and his
love interest, while Thornton portrays just the kind of coldhearted
villain whose lights you want to see punched out. Baker, so good in
``Goose-Pimples,'' fares best here. He turns Pete's browbeating of
Ray into an understandable outlet for his own anxiety and
loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Penhall's play is rather runnier than the omelet Pete
cooks up. It leaves you a bit famished, as much for a meaty play as
for brunch.

   IMPEACH _ Does the Senate impeachment trial of Clinton get
beyond the ceremonial reading of the articles of impeachment and
swearing in of Rehnquist and the Senate? (Foskett/Carr, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).
</P>
<P>
   w/IMPEACH-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ The White House warned Thursday
that if the Senate insists on hearing witnesses in the impeachment
trial of President Clinton, a long and complicated trial was
likely. ``It will significantly extend and delay this process and
all bets are off,'' said spokesman Joe Lockhart. If Clinton's
defense insists on using every legal tool available, as expected,
the trial could easily last months. (Deans, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-LEGAL _ WASHINGTON _ What legal resources are available
to President Clinton and the House prosecutors if a full-blown
trial ensues? Clinton's private lawyers, presumably, can expand
their staff at will, but can outside teams also assist the House
managers? What will it cost, and who will pay? (Malone, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-SCENE _ WASHINGTON _ A pair of solemn and symbol-laden
ceremonies opened the impeachment trial of President Clinton on
Thursday. It was the stuff of history for the American public to
view, even as the politically charged details of the trial were
bein worked out in secret negotiations. (Dart, Cox News Service).

Drollette's decision to create an Employee Stock Ownership Plan for

1994-98 tax years. (Moskal, Cox News Service 550).

`BALANCHINE BLACK AND WHITE CELEBRATION': 3 MASTERPIECES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also BALLANCHINE-BALLET, CONDUCTOR-BALLET) 
(mk) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York State Theater was a glorious place to be
on Wednesday night. The New York City Ballet continued its
50th-anniversary season by offering George Balanchine's ``Agon,''
``Concerto Barocco'' and ``The Four Temperaments,'' masterpieces
that surely rank high on almost everybody's list of top 10
Balanchine ballets.
</P>
<P>
   They were presented as part of what the company calls a
``Balanchine Black and White Celebration,'' programs featuring
plotless works danced in simple black or white tights and leotards.
Two of these pieces were not always this spare. At their premieres,
``Concerto Barocco,'' which dates from 1941, and ``The Four
Temperaments,'' first performed in 1946, had very fancy costumes.
But Balanchine considered them fussy and discarded them. When he
choreographed ``Agon'' in 1957, he envisioned it in black and white
from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Not every Balanchine ballet should be so austere. But for
certain types of intricate choreographic abstractions, nothing
should be allowed to obscure the movements. By discarding
eye-catching but distracting designs, Balanchine proved that less
can be more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agon'' is a marvel of invention. Just as Stravinsky's score
spikes the melodies of 17th-century court dances with 20th-century
rhythms and harmonies, Balanchine's choreography unites many
disparate qualities. The dancers seem colleagues one moment,
competitors the next, and the movements shift unexpectedly between
tightness and looseness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agon'' got off to a slightly tentative start, but soon
gathered energy. Maria Kowroski and Sebastien Marcovici
demonstrated that they had mastered the choreography's constant
dartings, both in their solos and in their ensemble passages with
Deanna McBrearty, Jennifer Tinsley, Edward Liang and Christopher
Wheeldon. And Wendy Whelan and Jock Soto made the fiendishly
difficult pas de deux a struggle between two determined people who
come to respect each other's strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Four Temperaments'' is inspired by medieval theories of
character types, and the soloists who symbolize these types preside
over the action like signs of the zodiac. Miranda Weese and Charles
Askegard were confident in the Sanguinic variation, and Aura Dixon
was fierce in the Choleric variation.
</P>
<P>
   The most distinctive interpretations were provided by the male
soloists. Heading the Melancholic variation, Damian Woetzel became
a man whose strength was ebbing away and, despite his efforts,
could not resist the urge to sink downward. In contrast, Albert
Evans, in the Phlegmatic variation, appeared to be someone
perfectly content to droop. Cameron Grant was the piano soloist in
the Hindemith score.
</P>
<P>
   A repeat performance of ``Concerto Barocco'' was admirably led
by Kyra Nichols, Jennie Somogyi and Nilas Martins. Guillermo
Figueroa and Nicolas Danielson were the soloists in Bach's Concerto
for Two Violins, to which the ballet is set. Maurice Kaplow
conducted.

`THIN RED LINE' PACKS A SUBTLE YET POTENT EMOTIONAL PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Terrence Malick's ``The Thin Red Line'' _ the second of the 1998
release year's major World War II movies _ is very different from
``Saving Private Ryan,'' and probably not visceral enough to come
anywhere near it at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   It's a moody, expertly crafted, completely engrossing ensemble
piece that carries a much more subtle but equally powerful
emotional punch. If its momentum of strong reviews continues, the
best picture Oscar race could well turn into a contest between
these two dueling war epics.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the films are polar opposites:
</P>
<P>
   _ Where Steven Spielberg's ``Ryan'' is a slice of the European
Theater that ultimately sanctions its particular war and finds the
sacrifice of those Americans who fought it to be noble, ``Line'' is
a slice of the Pacific Theater that can make no real sense out of
the horror.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where ``Ryan'' is a realistic ``trip'' movie that forces us to
experience the helplessness and horror of combat mostly from the
point-of-view of one good man, ``Line'' is much more stylized and
impressionistic, and takes place inside the heads of entire company
of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where `Ryan'' is fast-paced, nerve-jangling, highly cathartic
and somewhat manipulative, ``Line'' is _ in the spirit of Malick's
1978 ``Days of Heaven'' _ much more leisurely, elegiac, ambivalent
and filled with shots that evoke both the beauty and cruel
indifference of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Also unlike ``Ryan,'' ``Line'' is based on a novel _ indeed,
what many critics consider the greatest American combat novel after
``The Red Badge of Courage.'' So while Spielberg was free to be
creatively innovative, many of Malick's choices seem designed to be
faithful to the spirit and structure of James Jones' 1962
masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Like that novel, this second film version (the first was a
low-budget 1964 affair directed by Andrew Marton) follows an entire
infantry unit _ C-for-Charlie Company _ through hand-to-hand
fighting for control of Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands, perhaps
the bloodiest single battle of the Pacific War.
</P>
<P>
   Its primary point of view is that of Pvt. Witt (played with just
the right passive soulfulness by actor Jim Caviezel) As the film
opens, he has just been grabbed from a blissful AWOL hiatus in a
Solomon Island village and forced to rejoin his company on the eve
of the Guadalcanal landings.
</P>
<P>
   But while Witt's story opens and closes the film and his
presence links its most important sequences, the movie doesn't
really have a main character. Instead, it's a kind of symphony that
gives relatively equal weight to almost 20 different officers and
enlisted men (from the novel's 84 characters).
</P>
<P>
   As Malick dramatically chronicles the beach landings and a
succession of jungle skirmishes during the film's near-three-hour
running time, he constantly shifts his point-of-view, moving in and
out of his gallery of characters' stream-of-consciousness to record
their poetic meditations, prayers, fears and random thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he frequently cuts away to a progression of
striking images _ the twisted roots of a banyan tree, a charred
bird pathetically trying to crawl from the line of fire, the blurry
eyes of a crocodile captured for brutal sport _ to both punctuate
his human story and gradually build an vision of environmental
devastation and Paradise Lost.
</P>
<P>
   While the film never quite traumatizes its audience in the same
way as ``Private Ryan,'' Malick's visual/aural mosaic leaves us _
as Jones' novel did _ feeling that man is trapped in an endless
cycle of ritual insanity that is so ingrained in his genes and
group psychology that it will require some profound evolutionary
change to escape it.
</P>
<P>
   The movie has some annoying flaws, and almost as many sloppy
'90isms as ``Titanic.'' At one point, a character actually says
(twice), ``I'm outta here!'' Also, too many of the important
characters are played by little-known actors who look alike. With
their faces half hidden by their helmets, it's particularly hard to
tell Adrien Brody, Ben Chaplin and Elias Koteas apart.
</P>
<P>
   The billed-above-the-title Sean Penn is criminally miscast as
Welch, the mother-hen, by-the-book first sergeant who runs
C-For-Charlie by the sheer force of his physical presence. This is
the same character Burt Lancaster embodied so wonderfully in ``From
Here to Eternity'' (``Line'' being a sequel to ``Eternity'') and
the scrawny, scowling, incorrigibly introverted Penn could not
possibly be more wrong for the part.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite this and the distraction of too many big stars in
tiny cameo roles, ``Thin Red Line'' comes together to be a numbing,
mesmerizing, strangely addicting cinematic equivalent of a great
book: a film that allows us to experience Guadalcanal through the
emotions of a vast tapestry of characters and leaves us with
novel's melancholy acceptance of man's inhumanity to man and
nature.
</P>
<P>
   It has authentic locations (much of it was actually shot on
Guadalcanal), sumptuous cinematography (the New York Film Critics
recently named it the year's best), a low-key and exquisitely
appropriate score by Hans Zimmer, and at least one Oscar-worthy
performance: Nick Nolte's complex, charismatic portrait of an
ambitious West Point colonel ruthlessly grabbing his big career
break.
</P>
<P>
   The film is an impressive showcase for Malick's long-dormant
directorial skills and his uncompromising, high-integrity,
'70s-based filmmaking sensibility. All in all, it marks a
triumphant return for this writer-director who dropped out of the
business more than 20 years ago, and vindicates those critics who
have considered him something of a cultural martyr ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The Thin Red Line. Directed and written by Terrence Malick.
Cast: Sean Penn, Adrien Brody, Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, George
Clooney, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson, John Travolta, John Cusack.

that if the Senate insists on hearing witnesses in the impeachment
trial of President Clinton, a long and complicated trial was

KT SULLIVAN: HUMOR WITH NOSTALGIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Noel requires an umlaut over the o) 
(DW) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are two KT Sullivans. One is a serious cabaret
singer whose lyric soprano suggests she spent years studying the
mother of them all, Barbara Cook. The other is a jiggling,
eye-batting, swiveling, peaches-and-cream-skinned, '50s-style
bombshell whose comic stage persona suggests Marilyn Monroe doing
Judy Holliday.
</P>
<P>
   Melding these two hasn't always been easy for Ms. Sullivan, who
tends to overplay her ``dumb blonde'' parody. But in her new
cabaret act, ``Noel, Cole and Bart,'' which plays at the Firebird
Cafe here through Jan. 22, she has found a near-perfect blend of
humor and nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Noel, Cole and Bart are Noel Coward, Cole Porter and Bart
Howard, three songwriters whose work defines a certain witty,
high-toned urbanity. And Ms. Sullivan, accompanied by West McAfee
on piano and John Loereke on bass, has gone out of her way to find
worthy obscurities by all three. Take ``The Physician,'' a 1933
Porter gem in which an examining doctor approves of his
sweetheart's vertebrae, coccyx, patella, thorax and other body
parts but can't bring himself to say, ``I love you.'' Ms. Sullivan
uses the song to bolster the proposition trumpeted by another
Porter song, ``Most Gentlemen Don't Like Love.''
</P>
<P>
   An even funnier medley fuses two Coward songs of affected angst
_ ``World Weary'' and ``Weary of It All'' _ to suggest that the
pampered, citified narrator wouldn't last a day living the bucolic
life he envisages as a purifying escape from hell.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the show, Ms. Sullivan pauses to deliver sweet
straightforward versions of ``So in Love,'' and ``Wunderbar'' from
``Kiss Me Kate'' and two Bart Howard numbers, ``Walk Up'' and
``Year After Year.'' Their poignancy lends the froth the right
amount of substance.

`PROVIDENCE': SURE, MOM MAY BE DEAD, BUT THAT WON'T STOP HER

<P>
   A beautiful cosmetic surgeon named Sydney Hansen (Melina
Kanakaredes), brown curls cascading down her back, travels from Los
Angeles to her hometown of Providence, exuding the aura of Glinda
the Good Witch. The resemblance may be accidental, the result of a
hideous green bridesmaid's dress she wears for her pregnant
sister's wedding, but it suits her. Before you know it, Syd is
dispensing kindness and wisdom, being nice to puppies, saving human
lives in a clinic. Soon all the people of Providence are clicking
their heels and chanting, ``There's no place like home.''
</P>
<P>
   Or at least they ought to be. In fact, there's no heel-clicking;
there IS an excruciatingly dragged-out scene in which her
teary-eyed veterinarian father, possibly confusing her with the dog
on his lap, says, ``Please stay.'' So she does. But only after
returning to Los Angeles and finding her boyfriend in the shower
with another man.
</P>
<P>
   When a show sounds this cockamamie and is meant to be a drama,
you know it's in trouble. ``Providence'' tries to be quirky,
realistic and warmly inspiring but comes off as dull, calculated
and closer to the Land of Oz than the state of Rhode Island or any
other state of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this cliche-ridden family drama carries a revealing message
about how Hollywood condescends to viewers, treating them like
mental Munchkins. The show was created by John Masius, who was also
responsible for a dark, never-seen pilot for ``Touched by an
Angel'' and was dismissed when he refused to make it more cheerful.
He has apparently learned something about what sells:
``Providence'' is loaded with uplifting messages about divine
guidance and wishful thinking about the comforts of home. But there
is not a hint of hard-won emotional truth or thoughtfulness behind
its feel-good sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   Driving to the Los Angeles airport in the first episode, Syd
announces the series' stunning lack of originality in a voice-over:
``Thomas Wolfe says you can't go home again; sometimes a daughter
doesn't have a choice.'' Everything that follows is just that
blithe. (Of course she has a choice.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has seen the many NBC promos for the show knows that
Syd's mother drops dead at the altar. In every episode after that,
Mom (Concetta Tomei) reappears in Syd's dreams, chain-smoking,
giving advice, trying to sound irreverent but actually reinforcing
a more soothing illusion. Even death isn't quite real here, and the
ghostly mother is the last word in never leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the second episode, Syd trots out an ancient
cliche, reading a Webster's dictionary definition. The first
meaning of Providence is the capital of Rhode Island; the second,
she finds, is ``divine direction.'' And so, Touched by a
Dictionary, Syd returns permanently to what she calls ``Providence,
my hometown and God's will.''
</P>
<P>
   The living members of the family are given soap opera lines. As
Syd's sister, Paula Cale is invigorating, making a whiny character
seem likable. But as their grieving father, Mike Farrell wrings
every bit of mawkishness from the role and adds to the show's
conspicuous fakery (at least in the first few episodes).
</P>
<P>
   The series' greatest asset is Ms. Kanakaredes, who tries not to
overplay the saintliness of Syd, even as she branches out beyond
her family and interferes in the lives of total strangers at the
clinic. But there is no escaping the limits of such hackneyed
writing.
</P>
<P>
   The actual city of Providence, where many exterior scenes were
filmed, provides the only glimpses of realism here. The city looks
exquisitely inviting and pretty, with a newly renovated riverside
and tree-lined streets. Yet even that connection to fact is
superficial.
</P>
<P>
   The real Providence is a city with a healthy ethnic mix; in the
fictional ``Providence,'' even the working-class characters are as
pasteurized as Sydney and the rest of the Hansens. Kyle (Tom
Verica), Syd's old high school classmate, is now a none-too-bright
limo driver with whom she has a budding flirtation. ``He's
something I never encountered in L.A., a real man,'' she gushes,
though he seems fake and wimpy from this side of the screen. That
makes him fit right into the fantasyland that is ``Providence,'' a
show desperately in need of a heart, some courage and a brain.

IMMIGRANT'S DREAMS SHATTERED BY TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOSEPH BARRIOS  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Jose Delfino Castorena doesn't know if his foot
slipped or if someone bumped him.
</P>
<P>
   What he does know is that it dramatically and permanently
altered his life.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, Castorena was one of about a dozen
undocumented workers who spent a whole day riding in an empty rail
car. Bound for Dallas, he planned to work for a relative who cleans
office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   He expected to stay for about a year, then return home to Mexico
with enough savings to build a small grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell over the countryside and a rain began, the
coyote _ the man who smuggled the workers into the United States _
told the men to prepare to get off.
</P>
<P>
   Castorena thought it was safe to jump. He wasn't scared.
Instead, he was thinking about the life he could provide for his
two young daughters and his wife, Guadalupe, back home in San Luis
Potosi, between Mexico City and Monterrey.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old watched as one by one the others shuffled their
way to the side of the rail car and leaped off. They jumped from
the fourth car of a 20-car train.
</P>
<P>
   Castorena was one of the last to jump. He was the only one to
fall underneath the train.
</P>
<P>
   His memories are fuzzy after that, but he remembers hearing the
``whooshing'' sound over his left shoulder as 16 rail cars charged
over him.
</P>
<P>
   Jose's next clear memory is of a paramedic standing over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a nurse told me I lost a lot of blood and they were
going to save my life,'' he said in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ---------------------
</P>
<P>
   At around 9 p.m. on Aug. 22, San Antonio firefighter Joe
Benavides and his co-workers at Station 36 had just finished
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   They were settling down to watch television when Benavides'
rescue truck and an ambulance were called to a remote area outside
of the city, which runs parallel to the railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The call came in as an injured party. We were unaware of the
situation until we arrived,'' Benavides said.
</P>
<P>
   It took less than five minutes to arrive at the scene. They
found Castorena leaning against the concrete rail guard, drenched
in rain and blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was delirious ... crying for mercy and asking for help,''
Benavides said.
</P>
<P>
   Caught under the train, Castorena's left arm and right hand had
been severed. Medics took Castorena into the ambulance and tried to
stop the bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Benavides and two other firefighters formed a search party. The
faster they could find his limbs, the better the chance that they
could be reattached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to find them. We didn't know where they were,''
Benavides recalled.
</P>
<P>
   They followed the tracks east from an overpass, into the
darkness for 100 yards. Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Then they turned back, heading about 100 yards west of the
overpass.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we located his arm. We went farther out, about
another 30 or 40 feet, and we located his hand,'' Benavides said.
</P>
<P>
   The upper portion of the left arm was badly damaged. So was the
entire right hand. Castorena was rushed to Wilford Hall Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors did the only thing they could. They attached his left
hand to his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   Benavides, the father of a 17-year-old son, said he felt pain
for Castorena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just look at him as another human being. Whether they're
from this country or not, I can't imagine losing my hands at that
age,'' Benavides said.
</P>
<P>
   -------------------------
</P>
<P>
   Castorena's first clear memory after the accident came three
days later, when he opened his eyes in his room at Wilford Hall.
His brother Esteban from Mexico was standing over him, telling him
he was going to be OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid I was going to die. I told (Esteban) there was
bad news he wasn't telling me,'' Jose said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilford Hall officials had contacted the Mexican Consulate
General's office in San Antonio and arranged for Jose's brother and
wife, Guadalupe, to come into the country on a ``humanitarian
reasons parole.'' His mother was allowed to visit for a few days on
a tourist's visa.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters from Station 36 kept up on Castorena's
condition. When they learned that his family might be sent back to
Mexico if they were unable to find a family to stay with. The
firefighters started asking around for help. They found that help
in another firefighter, John Lujan Jr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Lujan had told his father, John Sr., who offered to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I decided to go up there and visit with him,''
said Lujan Sr., the pastor of Ven A El Iglesia de Bautista in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   He said it's God's blessing that Castorena survived the jump at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was coming to search for a job like everybody else. He
wanted to work for a while, then go back home,'' Lujan Sr. said.
``It's just a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Guadalupe and Jose moved with Lujan Sr. and his wife, Dolores
Lujan, for Jose's recuperation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jose's days are spent between the Lujan house and clinical
settings such as a hospital, doctor's office or rehabilitation
facility.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Castorena is learning to get by. His victories are
mastering simple tasks.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a harness on his wrist and forearm, he is able
to brush his teeth. And he also is able to take off, but not put
on, his clothing, according to occupational therapists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's able to move his fingers now and has a little bit of
strength in his hand,'' Lujan Sr. said. ``He's doing remarkably
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose's 4-year-old daughter, Marta Carolina, has only been told
that her father was in an accident. His 2-year-old daughter, Susana
Adeline, is too young to understand. They're now staying with
Jose's mother in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican Consulate General's office says Jose and Guadalupe
will probably be returned to Mexico when he has recover, which,
according to doctors, should be another two months. They have no
legal grounds to stay in the country, said Julio Bastarrachea,
consulate spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing we can do,'' Bastarrachea said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Howard, an orthopedic surgeon who operated on Jose
at Wilford Hall, said he wrote several letters to the INS in an
effort to enable his patient to stay in this country for recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Determining when the Castorenas will have to return to Mexico
will not be easy, said Ray Dudley, spokesman for the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision will be a joint decision between us and the
consulate. We don't, as an operational policy, knock on doors
unless we are part of a task force where we're dealing with crime.
This is not a police state,'' Dudley said.
</P>
<P>
   ---------------------------
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to the United States, Jose worked as a chauffeur
and waiter in San Luis Potosi. Good jobs were difficult to come by.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed to pay a coyote $100 up front and $600 more after
getting a job in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it was easier if you took the train because you
didn't have to cross the river,'' Jose said. ``That was a lie. We
had to cross the river anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   After falling under the train, Jose can remember feeling the
bottom of the rail cars striking him in the back of the head. Small
bald spots remain.
</P>
<P>
   While frantic with pain and shock, Jose tried three times to
stand up after the train passed over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give thanks to God that I got up. I don't know how I got
up,'' Jose said. ``For my daughters, I did not want to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose started walking toward the coyote and the others from the
train. Nobody would help him.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley said he was not surprised the coyote would not help Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't care less. He has no personal interest in these
people other than the money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley said he has seen other cases where a smuggler abandoned
migrant workers after an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the coyote) loses him, there's more waiting,'' Dudley
said. ``It happens over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   ------------------------
</P>
<P>
   The Castorenas are a little uncertain about their future. They
don't know when they will return to Mexico, and they miss their
children.
</P>
<P>
   But the couple rejoices in small steps. They are grateful to the
medics, the doctors, the chaplain and therapists who have helped
them. They also are thankful that church members and Jose's brother
took up a collection of clothing, toys and money to give them and
their daughters a decent Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give thanks for all those who have helped me. God is great.
For those who have been in similar accidents, there is a God and
God's word, and there is hope and there are blessings,'' Jose said.

REHABILITATION IS SLOW FOR JOSE CASTORENA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HUTTON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Dr. Richard Howard knew the decision he made might
be called radical by some physicians.
</P>
<P>
   But after seeing Jose Castorena's severed arms, the orthopedic
surgeon knew the illegal immigrant's only hope was a cross-arm
transfer _ attaching Jose's left forearm and left hand to the
patient's right forearm stump.
</P>
<P>
   Jose's thumb now faces downward and his little finger points up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few cross-arm transfers reported (in medical
journals),'' said Lt. Col. Howard, who is assigned to Wilford Hall
Medical Center at Lackland AFB in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some (non-orthopedic surgeons) would see it as
controversial,'' he added. ``But without fail, patients prefer
their own limbs rather than a prosthesis.''
</P>
<P>
   Before doing replant surgery on Jose in August, Howard noted
that the 24-year-old's trauma had resulted in crushing injuries _
common in train accidents _ to portions of both arms, which had
been severed. The severed limbs had to be replanted within six
hours after the accident to make them useful again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guillotine effect is better, but he had crushing
amputations,'' Howard said. The elbow joint on the left arm had
been crushed and destroyed; the right hand was mangled and the
right wrist also was mutilated, the physician added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jose is unusual to lose both arms because we more commonly see
leg or feet amputations,'' said Howard, referring to undocumented
workers who either fall or jump off trains on their way to a
supposed better financial life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said Jose's youth, good physical condition and lack of
other major injuries made him a good candidate for a limb replant,
which does not have the potential for rejection like organs
transplanted from another person.
</P>
<P>
   After spending three weeks in the hospital, Jose was discharged
and began his off-site rehabilitation. His hospital bill was sent
to his family in Mexico for payment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the major trauma and radical procedure, Howard called
Jose's recovery remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to work a non-labor trade,'' Howard said.
``With a replant, he probably won't have more than five pounds of
grip compared to the normal function of 80 to 100 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he has done remarkably psychologically,'' Howard said.
``His Christian faith has given him a tremendous lift. He has a
fantastic attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my greatest concerns was how he would handle this _
losing both arms and having put his hand on backward _ emotionally.
It could be a huge psychological burden.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jose has carried his positive attitude into rehabilitation
at Healthsouth Rehabilitation Institute of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to measure grip strength, Jose recorded 11 pounds
briefly on a device during one rehabilitation session.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time he did it (in September), there was two pounds
of pressure,'' said therapy student Erinn Bratley.
</P>
<P>
   Registered occupational therapist Diana Estrello, who works with
Jose regularly in rehabilitation, said he is the first patient she
has seen with an arm-hand replant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We treat him as a patient with a tendon repair injury,''
Estrello said. Much of the treatment focuses on using an ultrasound
device for heating and massage to help decrease swelling and scar
accumulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to loosen the tendons, stretch the tendons so
that we can increase the range of functional activities,'' Estrello
said.
</P>
<P>
   In between his three weekly sessions, Jose's wife, Guadalupe,
continues the rehabilitation at home.
</P>
<P>
   The treatments can be uncomfortable, but Jose responds
positively.
</P>
<P>
   When Estrello puts Jose's hand on a towel on a tabletop with his
arm at a nearly 90-degree angle, the patient's fingers curl.
</P>
<P>
   She then stretches each finger individually. Jose grimaces
briefly as each finger is exercised. Estrello keeps constant
pressure on the top of his hand to keep it flat on the towel.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Estrello and Bratley work with Jose's left stump.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, he couldn't lift it,'' Estrello recalled. ``Now he
can do 70-80 degrees where 110-120 degrees is normal. His range of
motion is better.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he tries to grasp a ball and a cup with a handle, but
finds the process a bit awkward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to work on fine motor skills now,'' Estrello
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jose is learning to feed himself, comb his hair and brush
his teeth with the help of a special brace on his right forearm.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Jose and Guadalupe feared they might injure the
tendons with too much pressure. Estrello said that won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid something might tear in his arm,'' Guadalupe said
in Spanish through an interpreter. ``He said for me to be careful.
Now he says I have too much confidence and it hurts (his arm). He
thinks I'm too tough on him.''

   National Forecast
</P>
<P>
   Snow will streak eastward across the northern Middle Atlantic
and southeastern New England states Friday as mild, moist air
streams northward over a dome of cold air. Snow will arrive over
New York City by early afternoon and then Boston a bit later, but
snow will change briefly to sleet and then to rain as developing
onshore winds import milder ocean air. About 1 to 3 inches of snow
are possible along the Northeast coast before the changeover
occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Farther inland, cold air will hold steady in the valleys,
setting the stage for a general snowfall of 2 to 5 inches of snow
across Pennsylvania and the southern two-thirds of New York state
and New England. A few more inches of snow will accumulate from the
Poconos of Pennsylvania, the Catskills of New York to the southern
Green and White Mountains of Vermont and New Hampshire by midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will change to sleet across the northern Middle Atlantic
states from the Mason-Dixon Line southward as milder air gains a
foothold several thousand feet aloft. Farther to the southwest,
rain will fall over parts of the Ohio Valley as moisture from the
Gulf of Mexico intersects with a stationary front. Recurrent
showers moving from southwest to northeast will pass over the same
areas, setting the stage for moderate to heavy rainfall over parts
of Kentucky and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   A stripe of light to moderate snow will fall across the southern
Great Lakes. Snow showers and a few squalls will develop over
Michigan's Upper Peninsula as cold air is moistened in transit over
Lake Superior.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Snow at High Pressure
</P>
<P>
   When snow begins across the northern Middle Atlantic and
southern New England states Friday, home barometers will not read
``stormy.'' Indeed, barometric pressures will be rather high.
Moreover, weather maps will lack a potent center of low pressure
like those associated with major winter storms. Instead, snow will
develop as mild, moist air is drawn northward and forced to glide
over a dome of cold air near the ground, a process that forecasters
call overrunning. Snowfall may reach stormy totals atop mountains,
but heavier accumulations there will due to the lifting effects of
terrain.

EARTHA KITT: PURRING ALONG NICELY, THANK YOU 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Don't you know nobody's 38 anymore?'' Eartha Kitt
scoffed in her signature growl to the youngish waiter who presented
her with a bottle of champagne and a glass onstage at the Cafe
Carlyle on Tuesday evening. ``How would you like to be 78 before
this night is over?'' she purred, pouring a glass and tilting it to
his lips.
</P>
<P>
   The bubbly force-feeding led in to a Bart Howard song, ``You're
Too Young to Be Meant for Me,'' especially revised for Ms. Kitt's
new show, in which she rejects ``fair-haired boys'' for a
relationship with a 73-year-old millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Ms. Kitt, who still does a belly dance
during ``Uska Dara,'' announced, ``On Jan. 17, I will be a very
proud 72 years old.'' Although Ms. Kitt has been performing the
same act for decades with only small changes from year to year, it
is only recently that it has coalesced into a classic cabaret show
worthy of comparison with Marlene Dietrich in her prime.
</P>
<P>
   With hair-trigger timing, Ms. Kitt, who is playing at the
Carlyle through March 13, both embodies and parodies the role of
the gold-digging international siren she has played for so long. By
now, that character is more than a sexy comic creation; it is an
archetype that belongs to her and her alone.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliance of the show is that it hasn't frozen into a
shtick after all this time. When the comedy slips into seriousness
in songs like ``Could I Leave You?'' and ``Here's to Life'' (a
cabaret warhorse she delivers with a triumphal ferocity), the campy
overtones fall away, and Ms. Kitt emerges as a show business legend
serving up a life that is (to quote from ``It Was a Very Good
Year,'' another summing-up song in her show) ``like vintage wine.''

BRITAIN CUTS KEY INTEREST RATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ For the fourth time since October, the Bank of England
cut a key interest rate Thursday as Britain's economy continued its
slide toward recession.
</P>
<P>
   The cut, by a quarter of a percentage point, to 6 percent, still
leaves British rates double those for the 11 nations taking part in
the new single currency, the euro, illuminating the yawning divide
between Britain and much of the Continent. The European Central
Bank left its benchmark rate unchanged Thursday at 3 percent after
its first meeting since the single currency began trading on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the cut in Britain's securities repurchase rate
was purely a result of British and international economic pressures
rather than part of a strategy to bring Britain closer in line with
the euro. ``Britain is definitely a bastion of `out,' '' said Bryan
Allworthy, a European equity strategist at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   And while other countries outside the euro _ notably Denmark and
Sweden _ seemed poised Thursday to move closer to the euro, British
political opposition seemed as strong as ever. Joining the new
currency ``is not inevitable,'' said William Hague, leader of the
opposition Conservatives, buoyed by an opinion survey showing that
52 percent of respondents opposed the new currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was inevitable that the Titanic was going to set sail,'' he
said, ``but that doesn't mean you had to be on it. You have to make
your own choice. You have to exercise your own judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Sweden announced plans to move up its referendum on
joining the currency, while Denmark, which does not belong but
whose currency is linked to the euro, cut its benchmark interest
rate by 20 basis points, to 3.75 percent, closer to the euro
standard. Analysts said they expected further cuts in the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister of Sweden, Goran Persson, said his ruling
Social Democrats would decide their position on the euro at a party
congress early next year, 21 months earlier than planned. That
suggested that the successful introduction of the euro had
increased pressure to join, possibly by the time euro notes and
coins come into circulation in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Government leaders in Denmark, too, said they detected a
weakening of resistance to the idea of joining the euro. The latest
opinion survey there showed half of respondents in favor of joining
the euro, a marked turnaround from earlier opposition. The shift
has apparently been strengthened by developments this week when the
Danish currency, the krone, survived the euro's introduction
``strong and stable'' in the words of Kirsten Mordhorst, the deputy
director of the nation's central bank.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The reduction in British rates was seen largely as a response to
the economic slowdown that has spread from manufacturing to the
service industries responsible for much of the nation's recent
economic growth. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee _
which has had sole responsibility for setting interest rates since
the Labor government came to power in May 1997 _ cited a
``continuing slowdown in the U.K. economy'' and said pressure for
inflationary pay increases had eased. The bank's mission is to
maintain inflation at 2.5 percent, but industrialists and employers
are clearly expecting further cuts to bring British rates closer to
levels in the 11 euro countries.
</P>
<P>
   The rate cut had scant effect on the pound's value against the
euro, trading at about 70.6 pence to the euro. The rate is
equivalent to 2.77 German marks to the pound _ an exchange rate
that British exporters say harms their business by making their
goods too expensive in Continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ultimate objective must be to bring U.K. interest rates
into line with our competitors in the new euro zone as soon as
possible,'' said Ian Peters, deputy director-general of the British
Chambers of Commerce. Some analysts said that even after the last
four rate cuts, British monetary policy was still tighter than in
the United States or in Continental Europe, giving the Bank of
England more room for maneuver.

ADRIAN PIPER: INSIDE-OUT MEDITATIONS ON POISON OF RACISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Md.)  (lb) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The subject of race has prompted some of the most
mettlesome American art in the 1990s. And much of that work owes a
debt to Adrian Piper, an artist who helped introduce identity
politics into conceptualism nearly 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Piper, 50, came to the theme as both insider and outsider. A
light-skinned black woman from a middle-class background, she was
raised in Harlem but educated in private integrated schools. She is
usually taken for white in social encounters, and this ``passing''
status has been the springboard for much of her art.
</P>
<P>
   From this vantage, she has experienced racism firsthand: She
remembers being regarded with suspicion by other black children as
a child, and later by white adults when she had made her background
clear. Her response has been to explore the peculiar dynamic of the
in-between.
</P>
<P>
   In her art she plays the dual role of cultural eavesdropper and
provocateur. And she has tenaciously prodded and dissected the
concept of race itself to suggest its contradictory guises, whether
as a pretext for economic oppression, as a source of psychological
challenge or as a resistant, divisive fact of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Two traveling retrospectives of Ms. Piper's career are to appear
later this year, one in March at the Museum of Contemporary Art in
Chicago, the other in October at the University of Maryland in
Baltimore. But a compact minisurvey of some of her earliest and
most prescient work can be seen now at Thomas Erben Gallery in
SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   Under the umbrella title ``Mythic Being: 1972-1975,'' the show
brings together a group of hand-altered black-and-white
self-portrait photographs that represent a breakthrough moment for
the artist.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, after attending the School of Visual Arts, she was
producing and exhibiting abstract conceptual work, inspired in part
by the example of Sol LeWitt. It was only in 1970, when she was
studying at City College, that she seems to have made an emotional
connection to the black power movement, which led to a change of
direction in her art.
</P>
<P>
   This produced a series of politically charged performance
pieces, staged in private and in public and documented in
photographs, in which she played the central role. Disguising
herself in dark glasses, a spectacular Afro wig and a handlebar
mustache _ a kind of '70s version of blackface _ she created an
alter ego as a young, working-class black or Latino man.
</P>
<P>
   To the earliest shots of herself in male drag she added
cartoon-style speech balloons filled with quotations from diaries
she had been keeping since she was in her teens. She then paid to
have the pictures published among the advertisements in the art
pages of The Village Voice.
</P>
<P>
   The images, with their scrambling of race and gender, are
hilarious and weird. The Mythic Being seems to be visually based on
the day's icons of racial militancy, like the Black Panthers and
Angela Davis. But the chatty diary entries, which include
breathless reports of adolescent crushes, defuse any sense of macho
threat and underscore the androgynous nature of the performance.
</P>
<P>
   The work toughens in the 10-part series ``I/You (Her)'' from
1974. Here her face is joined by the collaged face of another
woman, a white friend with whom she had quarreled. The harsh,
bitter words Ms. Piper assigns to herself announce the end of the
friendship and imply that racism was a factor in the estrangement.
Significantly, she gradually transforms her face (with the help of
a felt-tip pen) into that of the Mythic Being as the piece
progresses.
</P>
<P>
   Thereafter, race became the main focus of the work. In 1975,
while a graduate student in philosophy at Harvard, Ms. Piper took
her performances into the street and had herself photographed in
male guise ``cruising'' white women in Harvard Square, staging a
fake mugging in a nearby park, and walking through crowds of
unheeding pedestrians thinking murderous thoughts and itching for a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures suggest a certain style of 1960s guerrilla theater
that blended klutzy absurdist humor and goading ideological
contempt. Its flavor is perhaps best distilled in a single 1975
photo piece in which the Mythic Being, seen in dramatically
shadowed close-up, seems to exhale the words ``I embody everything
you most hate and fear,'' written in a puff of cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   By this point, artist and alter ego had effectively merged. In
the later images in the show, the Mythic Being sits at a typewriter
surrounded by quotes from Immanuel Kant, the subject of Ms. Piper's
dissertation. (She now teaches philosophy at Wellesley College.)
Her use of blackface _ as a means to both distance herself from and
claim a racial identity _ had, one suspects, served its psychic
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Much has happened in art and in politics since 1975, though
certain things remain little changed. Racism, despite some contrary
signals, just won't let go, inside or outside the art world. Surely
that's why Ms. Piper's work from the early '70s makes almost as
much sense now as it did then, and why her link to younger artists
seems so evident and immediate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The ``Mythic Being'' series anticipates much contemporary art,
from the text-intensive paintings of Glenn Ligon to the emblematic
photographs of Lorna Simpson to the smart, sharp cross-gender work
of Lyle Ashton-Harris. And it clearly has a place in the current,
often rancorous debate on use (or misuse) of black stereotypes in
art.
</P>
<P>
   Such questions of precedence and influence will be easier to
evaluate when the retrospectives appear. But much of what makes Ms.
Piper an important figure can be found in bud in the Erben show. It
reveals an artist who has been from the start a witty and
aggressive controversialist, one who believes that art can be an
effective vehicle for ideas, and that ideas can spark
self-examination and social change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adrian Piper: The Mythic Being, 1972-75'' remains at Thomas
Erben Gallery, 476 Broome St., New York, through Jan. 16.

RUNNING BACKWARD IN HIGH HEELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When I heard that Elizabeth Dole was quitting
the Red Cross to consider a run for the presidency, I looked up the
column I wrote on her speech at the Republican Convention in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``She walked off the podium and into the crowd like a cross
between Oprah and revivalist Aimee Semple McPherson, holding hands
with Bob Dole's old rehabilitation nurse and his Senate security
guard,'' I wrote. ``She didn't just nominate Bob Dole. She blessed
him. She raised him from the dull.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, she didn't perform that big a miracle at the convention. It
later took Visa commercials and Viagra. What Liddy Dole did at that
convention was make herself a candidate for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of that column three years ago, I wrote: ``America
needs a good talk-show host. The other Dole and Kemp for
president.''
</P>
<P>
   I was just joking, especially about Jack Kemp, who's too
emotional to be president. Elizabeth Dole isn't.
</P>
<P>
   This is a woman who was May Queen at Duke University and
graduated from Harvard Law School in 1965, one of only 15 women in
the class. You don't achieve either of those things by being a
wimp.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Law never had room for Ally McBeals. The South always
had beauty queens made of polished steel.
</P>
<P>
   It's always been my theory that the first woman president will
be a Republican. Do the math.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the men who say they don't want a woman president are
Republicans. But they'll take a Republican woman over a Democratic
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women who vote Democratic will vote for a woman _
some because they'll vote for any woman over any man, some just to
see what happens and many because they've forgotten about Margaret
Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves fans of Al Gore _ Tipper, in short.
</P>
<P>
   All the Republicans need to get the gender gap working in their
favor is a good woman candidate. A lightweight famous wife like
Mary Bono couldn't cut it. A powerhouse insider like Liddy Dole
could.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound sexist, but for a woman to be a good candidate for
president, she should scare people _ specifically men.
</P>
<P>
   That's the only way a woman can get respect from the half of the
human race saddled with puny Y chromosomes. Most great women
leaders _ Queen Victoria, Margaret Thatcher, Boadicea, Xena Warrior
Princess, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Dianne Feinstein _ have scared
men to some degree or other.
</P>
<P>
   The deep, hidden secret of men is that we like to be scared by
women. Many of us, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   How else are we going to be kept in line? We don't know we're
alive unless there's someone telling us we're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher I'll always remember from elementary school is the
one who made me sit in the corner with a peck basket on my head
because I couldn't remember dry measures of absolutely no use in a
non-agrarian society.
</P>
<P>
   Can we imagine Liddy Dole making us, as a society, sit in a
corner? Yes, we can. In fact, that's why many conservatives would
want to vote for her.
</P>
<P>
   The women I dated were more attractive, intelligent and
ambitious than I ever was. The woman who later became my wife gave
me a lousy grade when she was my teaching assistant at Stanford.
Look, I was distracted.
</P>
<P>
   Can we imagine Liddy Dole being more attractive, intelligent,
ambitious and a tougher grader than her husband? Yes. We know who
controls the Viagra bottle in that household.
</P>
<P>
   My wife is definitely scarier than I am. She's the one you don't
want to get on the phone if you're a telephone solicitor.
</P>
<P>
   Can we imagine Liddy Dole reaming out Boris Yeltsin if he calls
asking for more free dollars? Da, we can.
</P>
<P>
   Can we imagine Liddy Dole pushing the button? Faster than Bill
Clinton, who's more of a zipper man.
</P>
<P>
   Liddy Dole scares me too much, and not just because her politics
are well to the right of her husband's. Underneath her Southern
charm and smarm is Antarctic ice. Bob is the warm half of the
couple.
</P>
<P>
   At the '96 Republican Convention, Liddy was talking when Bob
interrupted via closed-circuit TV on a big-screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he going to speak or am I going to speak?'' said Liddy,
pretending to joke. We all knew the answer, especially Bob.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment in the Republican Convention, I understood how
Republicans must feel when they see Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Both women are hard nuts, but one is a honeyed pecan and the
other is salty and dry-roasted.
</P>
<P>
   So you think Americans don't love tough women? A recent Gallup
poll found that the top five most admired women in America are
Hillary Clinton, Oprah Winfrey, Elizabeth Dole, Margaret Thatcher
and Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Any of them could have Arnold Schwarzenegger as antipasto.
</P>
<P>
   There's already one Bush in the race for the Republican
nomination. Thatcher is British. Oprah is in line for higher office
than president.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Hillary and Liddy, and Hillary is being floated as a
possible candidate for the Senate. Too bad they don't go
head-to-head for president, and give us a real and truly scary
Clinton-Dole contest.
</P>
<P>
   My wife can write the columns.

the man who created TV's leading producer of prime-time sap,
``Touched by an Angel.'' An Emmy winner for his writing on ``St.
Elsewhere,'' Masius goes with the phloem again in the syrupy new
family drama, ``Providence,'' which NBC has been promoting with a
fervor bordering on desperation.
</P>
<P>
   If based solely on the series pilot, this would not be a C-plus
review. Fact is, Friday night's episode would be a perfect
illustration for the dictionary definition of ``smarmy'': so
cloyingly ingratiating, so smugly earnest that the most common
reaction in a recent group viewing was a collective ``Eeew.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, NBC sent along tapes of two more episodes that elevate
``Providence'' to a more watchable level. But be warned, curious
viewer: There's still enough sap here to keep Rhode Island's red
maples blushing beautifully for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence'' is Masius' pronouncement that you can go home
again, even if your sister is a whiner and your brother is a
weenie. Melina Kanakaredes, who briefly lit Jimmy Smits' fire on
``NYPD Blue,'' stars as Sydney Hansen: successful doctor, prodigal
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Syd is plastic surgeon to the stars, with a healthy income
and a stylin' Malibu pad. She returns home to Providence,
ostensibly for her younger sister's wedding, and runs smack into
the unfulfilled expectations of her mother, a travel agent for
guilt trips.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sydney can resolve any long-standing family issues, Mom
(Concetta Tomei) promptly delivers a deluxe set of excess baggage
by expiring at the wedding ceremony. (We're not giving anything
away; NBC even mentions her death in its commercials.) In addition
to the guilt Sydney feels at failing to save her mother, she now
wrestles with the shame of abandoning a family that barely seems
able to get its own breakfast. Sister Joanie (Paula Cale) is an
unwed mother, brother Robbie (Seth Peterson) is an underachieving
schemer and father Jim (Mike Farrell) is a distant veterinarian
who's happiest when talking to the animals.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to figure out the rest. For one thing, it wouldn't be
called ``Providence'' if she went back to Los Angeles. And the
writers wouldn't be able to have fun with the word's multiple
meanings: a city, a hometown, an act of divine guidance, the
all-sustaining power.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some implausibles that may have you saying, ``Oh,
please,'' Kanakaredes is believably sincere as Sydney, and Tomei's
meddling matriarch, who returns each week in Sydney's dreams, gets
the choicest lines. Still, the show's pacing could use a shot of
caffeine, and the producers really should lose the narration at the
start of each episode. It only makes it seem that the writers
aren't clever enough to get all of the exposition into the script.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Skip the premiere and, if you're still curious,
start visiting ``Providence'' in a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy is back on TV, and Fox may have another animation
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy isn't visible in ``The PJs,'' but his voice and his
oddball sense of humor lend a sly counterculture appeal to an
effort that may be the first ``black'' comedy to attract a
widespread audience since ``The Cosby Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is the creator and one of eight executive producers _ a
formidable cadre that includes his own production company as well
as Ron Howard's Imagine Television and The Will Vinton Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Vinton, the father of Claymation and the California Raisins,
pioneers a new technique _ Foamation _ in ``The PJs'' to startling
3-D effect. But it's the gentle satire that may keep viewers coming
back.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy lends his voice to the principal character, Thurgood
Stubbs, the excitable building superintendent of the Hilton-Jacobs
Projects. Thurgood and his wife, Muriel, are childless, but they're
surrogate parents to a 12-year-old boy named Calvin. As Calvin and
Thurgood roam the halls and apartments looking to fix something,
political correctness is the most likely thing to break down.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most appealing thing about ``The PJs,'' at least the
first episode, is that it doesn't descend to the potty talk common
in so many of today's comedies. Indeed, and we mean no offense
here, it's quite charming.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Thurgood has his head in the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Providence. Hourlong drama about a plastic surgeon who leaves a
thriving Los Angeles practice to work at a clinic in her hometown.
Starring Melina Kanakaredes, Mike Farrell, Paula Cale, Seth
Peterson, Concetta Tomei and Leslie Silva. Premieres Friday night
on NBC. Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+

   (BBOX)The PJs. Half-hour animated comedy about the life of a
building superintendent in the projects. Premieres Sunday on Fox.

NAVAJO ZOO (Window Rock, Ariz.) - Navajo President Milton

eat and drink marijuana to keep his nausea and cancer pain at bay.
It works, he says, and he wants the illegal weed to be available to
other suffering patients. Whether that happens remains to be seen.

THE BARD'S THE BEST; THE REST IS SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner   How little, mark! that portion of
the ball, Where, faint at best, the beams of science fall. _
Alexander Pope.
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ To the chagrin of not a few scientists, William
Shakespeare has emerged in a BBC listeners poll as Britain's ``man
of the millennium,'' beating out two of science's
super-heavyweights, Charles Darwin and Sir Isaac Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the disappointment of the august egghead community,
biologist Lewis Wolpert told Reuters news service: ``What
Shakespeare really did was tell us what we already know but in a
very beautiful way, whereas Newton and Darwin transformed the way
we thought about humanity and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that the way it always is? Show people something really
new and exciting _ that they are descended from apes and primeval
slime or that what goes up must come down at varying speeds
depending on weight and mass _ and where does it get you? Come the
end of the millennium, whom do they remember?
</P>
<P>
   The guy who stated the obvious, over and over: And so, from hour
to hour, we ripe and ripe,
</P>
<P>
   And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot:
</P>
<P>
   And thereby hangs a tale.
</P>
<P>
   Poor science. We look to it to extend our lifespan, explain our
origins, chart the stars, shrink the globe and make us sexy until
our dying day. But do we revere it? Adore it? Quote long passages
from it whilst we worship or woo?
</P>
<P>
   No, humanity generally holds science and its practitioners to
the long-held Hollywood ethic: What have you done for me lately?
</P>
<P>
   Why can't science get no respect? After all, it was W.H. Auden,
a thoroughly English poet, who confessed: The true men of action in
our time, those who transform the world, are not the politicians
and statesmen, but the scientists. ... When I find myself in the
company of scientists, I feel like a shabby curate who has strayed
by mistake into a drawing room full of dukes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for every Auden, there is a Matthew Arnold, another
English poet who wrote in 1888: More and more mankind will discover
that we have to turn to poetry to interpret life for us, to console
us, to sustain us. Without poetry, our science will appear
incomplete, and most of what passes with us for religion and
philosophy will be replaced by poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Does the fault lie, not in our stars, dear Brutus, but in the
theory of French painter Georges Braque?
</P>
<P>
   The way he saw it: Art is meant to disturb, science reassures.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps Noam Chomsky, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology linguistics professor, was closer to the truth two
decades ago when he said: As soon as questions of will or decision
or reason or choice of action arise, human science is at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe science can't help but be at a loss. As English physicist
Stephen Hawking observed: In effect, we have redefined the task of
science to be the discovery of laws that will enable us to predict
events up to the limits set by the uncertainty principle.
</P>
<P>
   What chance has that against, ``To be, or not to be: that is the
question''?
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare vs. Darwin and Newton. Art vs. science. What if the
whole debate misses the point as well as the best candidate for
``man of the millennium''? Exactly 200 years ago, William
Wordsworth, another English you-know-what, cried out:
</P>
<P>
   Our meddling intellect
</P>
<P>
   Mis-shapes the beauteous form of things _
</P>
<P>
   We murder to dissect.
</P>
<P>
   Enough of science and of art;
</P>
<P>
   Close up these barren leaves:
</P>
<P>
   Come forth, and bring with you a heart
</P>
<P>
   That watches and receives.

 &HT;    POMP AND PURPOSE: A HISTORIC DAY IN THE SENATE
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The crowded Senate chamber was hushed Thursday even
before Sergeant-at-Arms James Ziglar proclaimed his historic
warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear Ye. Hear ye. Hear ye. All persons are commanded to keep
silent on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives
is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of
impeachment against William Jefferson Clinton, president of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   For only the second time in the nation's history, an impeached
president was placed on trial before the Senate, and no one dared
stray from a script composed in a bygone century.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone involved _ from the respectful tourists who waited an
hour in the cold for 15 minutes in the visitors gallery to a
resplendently robed Chief Justice of the United States William
Rehnquist _ played a role on this memorable day where ceremony was
substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get older, I can tell my kids I was here,'' explained
Jonathan Clark, a 24-year-old factory worker from Milwaukee. ``This
is history.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was an event so rare that no living American has
witnessed the like, and so unsettled that the conclusion _ or even
intermediary steps _ were impossible to forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps fittingly, a plea for divine guidance opened Thursday's
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy God, as this sacred chamber becomes a court and these
senators become jurors, be omnipresent in the pressures of these
impeachment proceedings,'' prayed Senate Chaplain Lloyd John
Oglivie. ``Grant the senators the ability to exercise clear
judgment without judgmentalism.''
</P>
<P>
   As the amens were sounded, the 13 House Republicans named as
prosecutors, or ``managers'' for the trial, were ending their
silent, solemn trek across the Capitol to present the two articles
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., they
walked two abreast through Statuary Hall, under the eyes of the
wryly smiling Will Rogers of Oklahoma, buckskin-clad Stephen F.
Austin of Texas and other famous sons and daughters of the 50
states. They strode across the Great Rotunda under the Capitol
dome, between statues of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson,
and finally beneath the words ``In God We Trust'' chiseled in
marble above the double doors of the Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The House delegation was ceremonially greeted by 96-year-old
Strom Thurmond, the South Carolina Republican serving as Senate
president pro tempore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, the managers on the part of the House of
Representatives are here and present, and ready to present the
articles of Impeachment,'' declared Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   The senators sat silent behind their polished mahogany desks as
the silver-haired visitor read the charges against Clinton. Some
stared at the podium. Others bent over tablets and took notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a combination of awe and hollowness _ emptiness and a
little bit of anger,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who believes
the impeachment process has been abused by the Republican House
majority.
</P>
<P>
   But such thoughts occurred behind expressionless faces.
Formality ruled the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The managers request that the Senate take order for the
trial,'' Hyde concluded. ``The managers now request leave to
withdraw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Mr. Manager Hyde,'' said Thurmond. ``The Senate
will notify the House of Representatives when it is ready to
proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   After dispatching a messenger to Rehnquist at the Supreme Court,
the Senate recessed shortly before 11 a.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   At about 1:20 p.m., the reassembled Senate _ and spectators in
the packed galleries _ stood in silence as Rehnquist was escorted
by six senators into the chamber. Putting his left hand on a
leather-bound Bible and raising his right hand, Rehnquist was sworn
in by Thurmond to preside over the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Then the chief justice, wearing a black robe with four gold
stripes on each arm, administered a similar oath to the senators:
``Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the
trial of the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, president of
the United States, now pending, you will do impartial justice
according to the Constitution and laws, so help you God?''
</P>
<P>
   Each senator stood in response to his or her name and
individually swore, ``I do.'' Then they walked across the
red-white-and-blue patterned carpet to the well of the chamber to
sign an ``oath book'' confirming their sworn commitment. One
hundred pens were spread beside the document so each senator could
use one and keep it as a souvenir if he or she wished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all felt weighed down by the magnitude of a
200-plus-year-old Constitution, and then you hear your name called
out _ it is a momentous occasion,'' Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.,
told reporters outside the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the function now of being a jury,'' said Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska. ``To do impartial justice. Now, that's the
standard, for each one to figure out what they do.''

<P>
   ANDY-KAUFMAN-FILM (New York) _ The director Milos Forman stopped
the action with a delighted, ``Perfect, Perfect,'' and the crowd
reverted to unfashionably dressed extras recreating one of the
routinely bizarre moments in the career of the performer Andy
Kaufman, his Carnegie Hall Concert April 26, 1979, when he took
everyone in his entire audience of 2,800 people who chose to come
along in rented buses for milk and cookies at a nearby school when
the show ended. The comic's career ended in 1984 when he died of
cancer at the age of 35. The film on his life ``Man on the Moon,''
which is being directed by Forman and stars Jim Carrey is scheduled
for release sometime next fall. By Peter Applebome. (Moved).

   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   CANCER-FILMS (Undated) _ The Big C has always been a fruitful
subgenre of Old Movie Diseases. Actresses from Bette Davis (``Dark
Victory,'' brain tumor, 1939) to Debra Winger (``Terms of
Endearment,'' lymphoma, 1983) to Diane Keaton (``Marvin's Room,''
leukemia, 1997) have received Oscar nominations for playing cancer
victims. The latest Hollywood divas to brave cancer on the screen
are Meryl Streep (``One True Thing'') and Susan Sarandon
(``Stepmom''). Both play well-off, middle-aged domestic goddesses,
but only Ms. Streep is made to look ravaged by the disease. By
Franz Lidz. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   DORIS-HUMPHREY-VIDEO (Undated) _ Five recently released video
cassettes concerning the dances of Doris Humphrey come variously
described. The packaging lists them as ``Coaching, Analysis and
Performance.'' A press release suggests ``Appreciation and Coaching
Documentaries.'' Speaking the same, somewhat awkward introduction
at the start of each video, Stephanie Clemens, a dancer and the
executive director of the Doris Humphrey National Society, refers
to them as ``instructional videos.'' By Robert Greskovic. (Moved).

   THEATER

<P>
   DAVID-LEVEAUX-THEATER (New York) _ David Leveaux is drawn to
plays that are ``killers,'' he says, and one could argue that this
English theater director certainly knows how to slay the New York
critics. Although he has worked only three times over the last 14
years on Broadway, where his production of Sophocles' ``Electra'' _
starring Zoe Wanamaker _ is currently playing at the Ethel
Barrymore Theater, on each occasion he has come away with mostly
raves. By Matt Wolf. (Moved). Photo.

   OLD-BROADWAY-SHOWS (Undated) _ There are many performing arts,

make up their minds about the second. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).

   GLASS-MUSIC (New York) _ By the late 1970s, Philip Glass was
poised to conquer the mainstream. ``Einstein on the Beach,'' of
1976, a non-narrative music-theater work created with the director
Robert Wilson, had solidified his reputation in the downtown arts
community. It had also served to clarify and codify Glass'
distinctive language. With remarkable facility, he explored new
media like film, dance and opera. Even today, he remains fascinated
with experimental hybrids of music and theater. ``Monsters of
Grace,'' a loose collaboration with Wilson, was given its premiere
last month at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Billed as the ``first
3-D digital opera,'' it promised revelation but delivered only
titillation, since its special effects seemed marginal to both
scenario and music. By K. Robert Schwarz. (Moved). Photo.

   BLUE-NOTE-RECORDS (Undated) _ When Alfred Lion, a refugee from

no idea that the small label would become an item of worship. This
month, celebrating its 60th anniversary, Blue Note is filling clubs
in Manhattan with past and present members of its roster. The
widespread adoration of the label has its roots in the Lion's
extraordinarily high level of artistic production. Over the years,
the label recorded Bud Powell, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Art
Blakey, Freddie Hubbard and Wayne Shorter. No other record label in
jazz has been as consistent in quality. By Peter Watrous. (Moved).

tallies links to more than 10,000 museums in 120 countries. By

   ART-EXHIBITS-PLACES (Undated) _ Art gets around. Museums are
pretty well stuck in one spot, but their treasures keep on
truckin'. At a time when museums build buildings that tend to be
more significant than the collections they shelter, some centers
have gone the less expensive route of converting existing
industrial centers into galleries. A few others are experimenting
with putting art, at least temporarily, into essentially
unconverted places that respectable museums would once have thought
dreadfully infra dig: marginal retail areas, department stores,
dance halls. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved).

   MUSEUMS-EXHIBIT-STRATEGIES (Undated) _ Many of the best ideas
for making Museums holdings and programs accessible and meaningful

   DIJON-ARCHITECTURE (Dijon, France) _ In 1991, when Dijon's
political elders decided to embark on the city's largest urban
project in decades, they chose a quintessentially Miami
architecture firm to do the job. How come? In truth, the selection
of Arquitectonica, headed by the husband-and-wife team of Bernardo
Fort-Brescia and Laurinda Spear, was the consequence of an earlier,
perhaps more fundamental, moment: the recognition by Dijon that it
could modernize the city's image by sponsoring some daring
architecture. So Arquitectonica won the international competition
for the $200 million development by proposing a striking visual
symbol as well as a practical design. By Alan Riding. (Moved).

``The Net'' _ have come into being that way. Television can be the
perfect environment for fine-tuning an imperfect film. The movie is
the failed prototype, offering a clear look at numerous mistakes to
avoid. And 13 hourlong episodes (rather than 90 movie minutes) can
give the characters enduring dimension. By Margy Rochlin. (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   KOETSU-ART-ANTIQUES (Washington) _ To his credit, the collector
Charles Lang Freer recognized the 17th century Japanese artist
Hon'ami Koetsu's accomplishments, particularly in calligraphy and
ceramics, and acquired several of his important works early in this
century. These formed ``the esthetic center of Freer's interest in
Japanese art,'' said Ann Yonemura, an associate curator at the
Freer Gallery of Art, who was an organizer of the current
exhibition, ``Japanese Art in the Age of Koetsu.'' It provides the
perfect complement to a larger show at the National Gallery
entitled ``Edo: Art in Japan 1615-1868.'' The 44 works on view at
the Freer, including paintings, calligraphy, ceramic vessels and
lacquer ware, demonstrate Koetsu's influence at a high artistic
moment when the traditional Heian culture in Kyoto was transformed
into a looser decorative style. By Paula Deitz. (Moved).

PATAKI'S NEEDS HELP WITH TV TO WIN NATIONAL OFFICE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki will never be John F. Kennedy.
The television does not love him, nor does Pataki appear at ease
speaking before the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who delivered his fifth State of the State Address
Wednesday (broadcast on public television), has gotten better over
the years. But he wasn't that good to start with, and odds are he
never will be.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers know and accept this. Remember, statewide voters
first chose Pataki in 1994 over one of the most gifted speakers of
our time, Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   But would the rest of the United States embrace a speaker as
stupefying as the sleepy-eyed Pataki can be, should he seek the
national spotlight of, say, a vice presidential run? Maybe, and
again on the same principle.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of the Great Orator, Ronald Reagan, the nation
was ready for the stiltedness of George Bush (and the hilarity of
Dan Quayle). Now, after six-plus years of President Clinton, whose
second most-famous love affair is with the camera, America could be
ready to again embrace a less-than-telegenic leader.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's address to the state Legislature Wednesday did not
resolve the lingering question we have about the governor: Is it
the smirk, right side of the mouth up, left side down, that makes
his head swing back and forth like Stevie Wonder at a slow-motion
match at Wimbledon, or is it the g-force of the swinging head that
causes the smirk?
</P>
<P>
   Note to Alice Green and any other would-be protestors: If you
want to hold up a derogatory sign and DON'T want to be seen by the
governor as he speaks, stand directly in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   Five seconds, smirk, shift the shoulders and swing to the left.
Seven seconds, smirk, shift the shoulders and swing to the right.
</P>
<P>
   The reason behind this is the TelePrompTer, those seemingly
clear plates of glass on stands to his left and right. That is from
where Pataki reads his speech. How about putting a TelePrompTer in
the middle? The governor said he likes simple solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few more:
</P>
<P>
   _ WORK ON HAND GESTURES: They are too few and far between, and
seem awkward and out of rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   _ LOSE THE SMIRK: It is not (at times) intentional, but the
governor sometimes comes across sardonic, solely by his facial
gestures.
</P>
<P>
   _ GO OFF SCRIPT: Wednesday's speech was boilerplate; despite the
meat of it being interrupted more than 70 times by (sometimes
partisan) applause, it contained only two great lines.
</P>
<P>
   One dealt with a traditional GOP theme, big government: ``In New
York, government had become that uninvited dinner guest who arrived
too early, ate too much and stayed too long.'' Good stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The other line came off the cuff, about how government should be
like a referee _ ``not like the ones who refereed the last three
Buffalo Bills' games.'' Great stuff.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Pataki gave a non-televised speech at the Court of
Appeals. He was said to be witty and personable. It can be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well done is better than well said,'' Pataki said Wednesday in
discussing a crime bill. If he does seek a national stage, the
governor should hope voters across the country agree with that
axiom.

MAN CLAIMING LOSS OF MEMORY IS ARRESTED IN CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ A young man who attracted international attention with
his strange tale of waking up in a Montreal parking lot in October
without any memory finally found his identity when police showed up
to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday morning, Montreal police charged him with public
mischief and obstruction of justice for deliberately misleading
investigators about his identity.
</P>
<P>
   After psychiatric treatment and hypnosis last fall, the man told
doctors he thought his name was James Edward Brighton and he
believed he was from New Jersey. But police say he actually is
Matthew Honeycutt, 28, from Tennessee, where he is being
investigated for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have proof that he knew who he was,'' said Sgt.
Christine Debon, a detective with the Montreal police. ``But we
can't say what it is, because it's before the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Michel Lussier, the Montreal attorney representing Honeycutt,
said he doubted the young man had lied about his identity,
especially after agreeing to have several newspaper articles and
television programs done about his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced that my client has amnesia,'' Lussier said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Honeycutt, pastor at the LaFollette Faith and Worship
Center in LaFollette, Tenn., about 38 miles north of Knoxville,
identified a photograph of the man in Montreal as his younger
brother Matthew, who suffered a nervous breakdown in 1990 and was
hospitalized for 40 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was treated and given a full release but he had to go back
every week'' for outpatient treatment, Honeycutt said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Matthew left his mother's house in Jacksboro, Tenn., on
Oct. 8, but the family did not file a missing-person report,
because he had disappeared before.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Vann, chief deputy of the Campbell County Sheriff's
Department, said Matthew Honeycutt does not have a criminal record
but he is being investigated on fraud charges. Vann said Matthew
used his brother's name to buy and register a car, and to take out
a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   ``He assumed his brother's identity,'' Vann said.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal police found the car Oct. 18, six days after Matthew
Honeycutt walked into a Montreal hotel asking for help.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Montreal General Hospital diagnosed a rare form of
amnesia, caused by psychological trauma. During treatment, the
young man stated that he thought he was gay and that he believed he
had lived in Morristown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives there could find no trace of him. But Kevin Honeycutt
said his brother had at one time held a clerical job in Morristown,
Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal police said that after the television program ``Hard
Copy'' ran a piece this week about the young man, several callers
identified him. The television program then contacted his family.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Honeycutt is being held in a Montreal jail. A bail
hearing is scheduled for Friday.

 &HT;    GOVERNMENT WITNESS WARNS OF AN ALL-MICROSOFT WORLD
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The final government witness heatedly declared at
the Microsoft antitrust trial Thursday that all computer users will
live in a ``Microsoft world'' unless the courts intervene to
restore competition to the software business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Microsoft forced upon the world a single (Internet)
browser, that would make things simpler, but that's not what choice
is about,'' said Massachusetts Institute of Technology economics
professor Franklin Fisher. ``We're going to live in a Microsoft
world.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Fisher's testimony, which will probably conclude
when the trial resumes on Monday, is the charge that by misusing
its Windows monopoly, Microsoft may manage to have a crushing hold
over the Internet unless it is checked by the antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, whose role is to serve as a big-picture, clean-up batter
for the Department of Justice, spent the day responding to a stiff
challenge from Microsoft Corp. lawyer Michael Lacovara, who sought
to portray him as a remote academic figure who lacked a good grasp
of how the fast-paced industry works.
</P>
<P>
   When Lacovara maintained that personal computer makers have a
lighter burden because they automatically get the Internet Explorer
Web browser along with their licenses for the company's Windows
operating system, the 64-year-old Fisher fell into a rage on the
witness stand, momentarily startling Lacovara, who is half his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you seem agitated, sir,'' Lacovara said, offering to take
a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am agitated. I feel very strongly about this,'' Fisher
replied. ``We're going to live in a Microsoft world. It might be a
nice world, but it's not a competitive world.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice rising, Fisher alluded to Henry Ford's remark in 1909
that his customers could have any color Model T car they wanted, so
long as it was black. ``If Henry Ford had a monopoly, we'd all be
driving black cars,'' he said. ``That's not what competition is
about. That's not what helping consumers is about.''
</P>
<P>
   At least part of Monday's court session promises to be closed to
the press while the contending parties review the Microsoft pricing
data for computer makers that Fisher has gathered under government
subpoenas. More than a dozen news organizations have filed for
access to the pricing information, which government attorneys
assert is vital to their case.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft officials earlier in the week said that the
government and Microsoft had quickly struck a deal to seal the
data, the government's lead attorney, David Boies, said ``We
haven't really supported it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We left the closing issue up to Microsoft and those parties
claiming confidentiality and non-confidentiality,'' Boies added.
``But we have said we think there are limits to what should be
protected. There are First Amendment limits in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the pricing data hearing, Microsoft's first witness,
Richard Schmalensee, the acting dean of MIT's Sloan School of
Management, will take the stand, probably on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Citizens for a Sound Economy released a public
opinion poll that found 81 percent of those surveyed think
Microsoft is good for American consumers and that 52 percent
believe the case was brought against Microsoft to help its
competitors. Spokesmen for the group declined to say who paid for
the poll and a Microsoft spokesman asserted he did not know about
the poll's existence.

lighter burden because they automatically get the Internet Explorer
Web browser along with their licenses for the company's Windows
operating system, the 64-year-old Fisher fell into a rage on the
witness stand, momentarily startling Lacovara, who is half his age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you seem agitated, sir,'' Lacovara said, offering to take
a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am agitated. I feel very strongly about this,'' Fisher
replied. ``We're going to live in a Microsoft world. It might be a
nice world, but it's not a competitive world.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice rising, Fisher alluded to Henry Ford's remark in 1909
that his customers could have any color Model T car they wanted, so
long as it was black. ``If Henry Ford had a monopoly, we'd all be
driving black cars,'' he said. ``That's not what competition is
about. That's not what helping consumers is about.''
</P>
<P>
   At least part of Monday's court session promises to be closed to
the press while the contending parties review the Microsoft pricing
data for computer makers that Fisher has gathered under government
subpoenas. More than a dozen news organizations have filed for
access to the pricing information, which government attorneys
assert is vital to their case.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft officials earlier in the week said that the
government and Microsoft had quickly struck a deal to seal the
data, the government's lead attorney, David Boies, said ``We
haven't really supported it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We left the closing issue up to Microsoft and those parties
claiming confidentiality and non-confidentiality,'' Boies added.
``But we have said we think there are limits to what should be
protected. There are First Amendment limits in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the pricing data hearing, Microsoft's first witness,
Richard Schmalensee, the acting dean of MIT's Sloan School of
Management, will take the stand, probably on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Citizens for a Sound Economy released a public
opinion poll that found 81 percent of those surveyed think
Microsoft is good for American consumers and that 52 percent
believe the case was brought against Microsoft to help its
competitors. Spokesmen for the group declined to say who paid for
the poll and a Microsoft spokesman asserted he did not know about
the poll's existence.

PRISONS MAY PUNISH CRIME, BUT FAMILIES PREVENT IT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ He calls himself Joey the Dope. And, a long time
ago, he was a dope, too.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's a thoughtful, thickset, bespectacled guy with
gray-flecked hair. I found myself thinking about him Wednesday
afternoon as I watched the governor deliver his State of the State
address in the New York Assembly chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, George Pataki was saying, ``putting violent criminals in
prison is a simple solution to a complex problem.''
</P>
<P>
   That's absolutely correct. It is a simple solution, which is
precisely why we've embraced it.
</P>
<P>
   The governor wants to end parole in New York and to toughen up
the juvenile justice system. That first part of that might be a
good idea; I don't know yet. The second part is definitely a good
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the virtues of plans like this, however, they really
don't get at the problem's heart.
</P>
<P>
   With only a few exceptions, boys grow into violent men for
well-documented reasons. But the politicians who want to prevent
that seem unwilling to protect the public from those boys who've
already become violent men. And the politicians who want violent
men locked up earlier and longer seem not to care about keeping
other kids from growing up to be violent men in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   So, the politicians talk right past each other. The conversation
becomes a test of political power. And, like me, Joey the Dope
would like to see the whole issue dealt with, not just half of it.
</P>
<P>
   I was talking to Joey the Dope Wednesday morning. I was saying
that a couple of fine researchers, Cynthia Harper of The University
of California and Sara McLanahan of Princeton, had done a detailed
study of why boys grow up to be criminals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, they began tracking 6,400 boys between the ages of 14
and 22. What they found is at once predictable and perplexing.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, poverty plays a role in kids growing up to be criminals. So
does racial discrimination and the anger it breeds. But, by far,
the single largest factor in whether a kid becomes a criminal is
whether he has a decent father around.
</P>
<P>
   One third of all births, and 44 per cent of first births, are
now to unwed mothers. A boy born to an unwed mother is 2.5 times as
likely as a kid produced by an intact marriage to end up in prison.
A kid whose parents split when he's a teenager is 1.5 times as
likely to end up in the can. And, statistically, kids with
stepfathers tend not to fare much better. Stepfathers and stepsons
tend to compete for the woman's attention rather than bond.
</P>
<P>
   So, at the most difficult time of his life _ when the hormones
kick in and a boy has to figure out how to be a man _ no man is
available to teach him. Or, as Joey the Dope recalls, the man is a
negative example.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1961,'' he told me Wednesday morning, ``I was sentenced to
10 to 15 years in prison in Rensselaer County Court for
first-degree grand larceny, for first-degree armed robbery and
third-degree burglary. I finished up in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not making any excuses for what I did. I was guilty as
hell. I had a mother and father, but I was a product of a very
dysfunctional family. I was subjected all through my youth to an
enormous amount of verbal abuse, sexual abuse and physical abuse.
My father broke my nose eight times.''
</P>
<P>
   If politicians are serious about preventing crime instead of
simply using it as a tool to attract votes, then they should work
at discouraging births by unwed mothers and at providing effective
counseling services to keep families together and functioning
properly.
</P>
<P>
   Simple? No, not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Crucial? Well, just ask Joey the former dope.

 &HT;    Motorola unveils device for TV convergence
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Motorola Inc. thinks the future of home
entertainment and Internet access may be a sleek black box that
connects to your television.
</P>
<P>
   At the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show Thursday, the company
unveiled new branding for
</P>
<P>
   its set-top box project. The Austin-designed and manufactured
multimedia architecture, previously code-named _Blackbird,_ was
introduced to clients and press at the show as _ Streamaster.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the new name better reflects what the
architecture, announced in September, does.
</P>
<P>
   Set-top boxes have evolved with the cable industry and have
traditionally worked as tuners with enhancements like TV listings
and pay-per-view capabilities. But a new generation of boxes are
upping the ante with high-end sound and video, support for Digital
Television (DTV), gaming and Internet capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Although the presentation at CES focused on the box itself,
produced currently by Motorola and
</P>
<P>
   manufactured in Austin by Solectron Corp., the goal is to make
Streamaster the building block for mainstream electronics makers _
the Toshibas and Panasonics of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola's Semiconductor Products division, based in Austin,
Texas, has been developing the project three years.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Farrell, a spokesman for Motorola, said the company is
taking a different approach with Streamaster than other chipmakers
are with similar projects. The insides of Streamaster will be
</P>
<P>
   fully programmable and Power PC-compatible, allowing
manufacturers to create their own applications without replacing
circuits and parts inside.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers will be able to choose what components and
features they want in the boxes, Farrell
</P>
<P>
   said. ``We feel that for the cost of two (product features),
clients will be able to get all the aspects they want. ``
</P>
<P>
   Among the products' features: _ Dual processors _ a Power PC and
a Nuon processor designed by VM Labs that will handle gaming and
graphics functions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Video processing, allowing DVD movie playthrough and audio
processing using Dolby, THX or DTS standards.
</P>
<P>
   _ Web browsing and TV tuner functions similar to WebTV.
</P>
<P>
   _ Support for Video On Demand.
</P>
<P>
   _ Router capabilities that would allow the box to be an Internet
hub, splitting Internet bandwidth
</P>
<P>
   off to various areas of the home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Support for a variety of programming languages including Java.
</P>
<P>
   Streamaster's coming-out party, housed in a cavernous set of
meeting rooms outside of the main Las Vegas Convention Center expo
area where 90,000 attendees are expected, fits well with the tone
</P>
<P>
   of this year's CES, which favors home electronics like High
Definition Television, DVD and audio.
</P>
<P>
   Major manufacturers, including Panasonic, Sharp and Sony are
hitting CES hard with homeelectronics that are promising better
quality video and audio in the home using digital technology and
high-end processors at lower costs. While technologies like HDTV
are pricey (sets debuted at prices
</P>
<P>
   about $7,000), other components like DVD players and audio
receivers have hit sub-$500 prices.
</P>
<P>
   As more products come out, the trend will be convergence as
all-in-one units that combine home theater video and audio with
network capabilities are expected to gain prominence as HDTV picks
up steam.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Motorola announced only one major customer for
Streamaster at CES. The
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor division's president Hector Ruiz had previously
said a roster of client and partnerships for the technology would
be presented at the show.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell said the company has several other companies producing
their own variations of the boxes, but that CES wasn't the right
venue for some of them to introduce the systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be perfect for us,'' he said. ``But it may not be
the perfect place for our customers _ that might be an
international broadcasting conference or a cable business expo.''
</P>
<P>
   The company announced its first customer for Streamaster _
Hongkong Telecom will use Streamaster for an interactive television
product that will deliver movies and educational titles on demand.
That product is expected to ship in March.

TRAFFIC DEATHS IN CONSTRUCTION ZONES RISE

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The number of traffic fatalities has held steady in
recent years, but experts say one category may be poised to rise:
deaths in construction zones.
</P>
<P>
   Such deaths now run at about 700 each year, with thousands more
injuries. But the huge transportation bill that Congress passed in
1998 will increase highway work sharply, most of it on existing
roads, not new ones. The number of construction zones may increase
two-thirds, according to the construction industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accidents in roadway construction zones are a serious public
health problem,'' said Pete Ruane, president of the American Road
and Transportation Builders Association, which, with the federal
Transportation Department, recently established an information
clearinghouse to try to spread safe practices among construction
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Safety officials point out that another ingredient in accidents,
heavy traffic, becomes worse and worse as cars travel another 2
percent or 3 percent more miles each year on essentially the same
amount of roadway. And more and more construction is done at night,
to avoid tying up traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But ``that is when we have our worst drivers, our sleepy
drivers, who may be `under the weather,''' said Thomas Hicks,
director of Maryland's Traffic and Safety Office.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar ``Give 'em a Brake'' highway signs may leave the
impression that most of the casualties are among construction
workers, but statistics show that all but about 100 are among
occupants of vehicles. The most frequent accidents are rear-end
crashes caused by drivers who are not paying attention when traffic
ahead slows down or stops, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of numbers,'' said Lt. Daniel W. Lonsdorf of the
Wisconsin State Patrol. ``There's a few highway workers out there,
but tons of cars.''
</P>
<P>
   States use a variety of strategies. South Dakota puts
``retired'' police cars into construction zones as decoys.
Massachusetts uses live state troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts does well in national rankings of construction
zone accidents. Nationally in 1996, the most recent year for which
full statistics are available, there were 41,907 traffic deaths, of
which 719, or 1.7 percent, were in construction zones, according to
data from the Transportation Department; Massachusetts was at 0.96
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Figures ranged from 4.3 percent in Georgia and 4.2 percent in
Wyoming to none in the District of Columbia, Utah and Montana. A
key determinant, though, was the number of miles under
reconstruction, a factor the Transportation Department did not
track.
</P>
<P>
   Many states have begun requiring the use of lighted signs in
advance of closed lanes, instead of passive signs or barrels. Many
use human flag-wavers. The Federal Highway Administration produced
two 30-second television ads and three radio ads urging drivers to
stay alert and slow down in construction zones.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious tactic is raising fines. According to the
American Road and Transportation Builders Association, a trade
group that operates an information clearinghouse on construction
zone safety, 31 states have doubled fines for speeding or other
infractions committed in road-construction areas, most of them in
the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is sure what works. The police are skeptical that the
signs threatening doubled fines make any difference at all, or even
how often such fines are applied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the state can give you a number,'' said Hicks of
the traffic office in Maryland, which is among the states that
level heftier fines for violations in construction zones. When
tickets are written, he said, ``I don't know how many officers
checked the box for construction zone and how often the courts
followed through; the judge can do what he wants.'' Hicks said,
though, that the signs warning of higher fines probably made
drivers more alert.
</P>
<P>
   Lonsdorf of Wisconsin said, ``I personally do not think
threatening people with more money and a fine is going to change
their habits.'' People drive as fast as the traffic allows, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll slow down if traffic is bottled up because that's
beyond their control,'' he added. ``But if they have clear access,
we have not seen an appreciable speed difference at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We try and sign those zones to 45 or 55 miles per hour, versus
65,'' Lonsdorf said. ``We're seeing speed through those zones of 75
or 80 miles per hour.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others said the police had trouble finding a safe place
in construction zones to detect speeders and pull them over.
</P>
<P>
   The construction trade group, which is at the Texas
Transportation Institute, on the campus of Texas A&AMP;M University,
maintains a Web site, wzsafety.tamu.edu, with more information.
Another Web site,
www.cals.cornell.edu/dept/aben/localroads/flaging.htm, set up by
Cornell University, gives advice on how flaggers should do their
jobs. Among various tips: never stand in the travel lane, make eye
contact with drivers and always have an escape route. &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS &QC;  &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   State regulations on how contractors set up work zones
concentrate on entrances because studies indicate that these areas,
where cars are squeezing into fewer or narrower lanes, are
especially dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   One index of the danger in highway construction is the fate of
energy-absorbing barriers used on the backs of construction trucks
and on concrete abutments. Quixote Inc. of Chicago, whose
subsidiary, Energy Absorption Systems, is a major manufacturer,
estimates that of the 10,000 of its barriers in the field in any
given year, one in four is hit so hard it must be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The barriers stop a car moving at 100 kilometers an hour (about
62.5 miles an hour) in about one one-hundredth of a second. That is
much faster than a blink of an eye, but also much slower than a
concrete barrier or the steel back of a truck does the job; the
effect is to lower the forces on car occupants to 20 times the
force of gravity, versus 50 times for a collision without the
barrier.
</P>
<P>
   The barrier also protects occupants of a construction truck from
whiplash, said Leslie J. Jezuit, the president of Quixote, and
reduces the likelihood that the truck will be pushed into workers
on the pavement ahead of it.

COMMENTARY: WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say, I've been away for the past four months writing a book. Has
anything happened while I was gone?
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, though, I am resuming my column, and precisely
because I've been gone I want to make up for lost time and dive
right into things with a proposal: I am demanding the impeachment
of George W. Bush, the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know. He hasn't even been made the Republican nominee
yet, let alone been elected president, but I want to get a head
start on things. So let the record show, you read it here first:
Impeach George W. now.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Congressman Bob Barr, that favorite speaker of white
supremacists, and his colleagues have been calling for Bill
Clinton's impeachment ever since they laid eyes on him. Well, I
just laid eyes on George W., and I don't like his looks. I don't
like his voice. I don't like his past carousing. And I don't like
his suggestion that only Christians get to go to Heaven. I want him
out, and I want him out before he's even in. I want him out before
he even thinks of being in. I want him impeached at his
inauguration. It will save time and money, since the Congress and
Senate will already be on hand, and so will Chief Justice
Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the drama on the Capitol steps when the chief justice
asks George W. to raise his right hand, and he thinks it's to take
the oath of office, but instead Justice Rehnquist says to him: ``Do
you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth, so help you God?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, you get the point. First Clinton demeaned the presidency
with his reckless affair with an underwear-flashing intern, and now
the House Republicans have matched him with a reckless bill of
impeachment over something that doesn't come close to a high crime
against the Constitution. Clinton and the Republicans are now even.
He disgraced the presidency and they've disgraced the Constitution,
but they both need to be stopped before they do any more damage to
our sacred institutions. And that's why I favor censure.
</P>
<P>
   I favor censure not because it's the most just and moral way to
bring this case to a close, but because it's the fastest. I judge
every proposal for ending this sordid affair now by one criterion
and one criterion alone _ miles per hour. How quickly will it end
this pathetic episode and take it out of the hands of Clinton
spinmeisters and the Republican Hezbollah?
</P>
<P>
   The idea that justice can still be done in this case is
ludicrous. You tell me where you'll find justice in the case of a
president who demeans his family, his party and his agenda by
having an affair in the Oval Office, and is then offered up for
impeachment by a partisan Republican prosecutor after he can't find
anything other than sexual fibs to justify his three-year
investigation into a 20-year-old land deal?
</P>
<P>
   Justice? You tell me where you are going to find justice between
a president who couldn't even make a proper apology to the American
people for defiling the Oval Office and a Republican Party that
stands for so little today that it has gone from the Contract With
America to the Contract on Bill Clinton. When a process so serious
_ impeachment _ gets hijacked by people so venomous, justice can
never be an outcome, it can only be a victim.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the Republicans crazy, and it's easy to see why: He
took all their good stuff _ welfare reform, balanced budget,
defense spending _ and left them with Phyllis Schlafly. I'd be
crazy too. (How appropriate that House Republicans chose the
unknown Dennis Hastert to be their next speaker _ the party with no
agenda led by the politician with no profile. A blank man for a
blank slate. Perfect!)
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Republican death struggle is the political
equivalent of the Iran-Iraq war. You just wish both sides could
lose, because this is not a war over America or the rule of law.
It's like everything else between the White House and Republicans
today _ it's just a war over who wins. And that's why for the rest
of us what matters is not how it ends, but how quickly it ends.
Because the sooner they stop fighting over nothing and start
dealing with something, like the nation's business, the better
chance that WE might still win.
</P>
<P>
   Justice? Oh, I'm sorry, it's all sold out this season. Between
Bill Clinton, Ken Starr and Bob Barr, I long ago gave up looking
for justice. Now I pray only for damage control. When there is no
one to root for, all you can root for is ``The End.'' The only way
you get justice with a crowd like this is not with the courts or
with the Constitution. It's with a broom.

RUBY-COLORED GLASS CONTINUES TO FASCINATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 10)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Colored glass always has provided a fascination
for the collector, especially the rich red of ruby glass.
</P>
<P>
   This type of glass, in which metallic oxides are used to create
colors, is also known as Bohemian glass, which is a name given to a
mid-19th-century glass with one or more layers of colored glass cut
away in patterns to reveal a clear glass body. This technique also
is referred to as ``cased'' or ``overlay'' glass.
</P>
<P>
   Although a wide range of colors were produced, ruby glass is
relatively expensive because gold chloride is added to the mix of
glass, which gives it the deep rich color. Contrary to one popular
belief, the gold has to be chemically treated before it can be
blended into the mixture, rather than just adding pure gold coins
or gold jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   The Romans made a form of ruby glass in the 4th century A.D.
(and the Egyptians made an opaque red glass by using copper, which
stains only the surface of the clear glass). This secret
glassmaking technique was lost for many centuries, but rediscovered
in the 17th century by Johann Kunckel in Bohemia, which later
become part of Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby glass was imported before being manufactured in America in
1861.
</P>
<P>
   Today, glassmakers use ruby glass rods, which makes for an even
more expensive process. Ruby glass is also made today by adding
cadmium selenide, which creates a bright ruby red glass.
</P>
<P>
   Cranberry glass also is the result of gold being added to red
glass. But because the amount of gold chloride is less, the color
is paler than ruby glass.
</P>
<P>
   Among antiques, there's red Venetian ruby glass from the 1890s,
according to Elise Abrams Antiques in Great Barrington, Mass.
``With Venetian ruby glass, you'll find beautiful figural stems,''
said Abrams. ``There's also beautiful Depressionware ruby glass
from the 1920s and '30s with lovely blown tops and molded stems.''
Steuben makes selenium red glass, which is considered one of the
top grades of ruby glass today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any collectible, the price of ruby glass depends on the
piece, quality, condition and maker,'' said Abrams. ``You can pay
as little as a few dollars for a piece of red Depression glass to
$1,000 or more for a piece of Steuben's selenium red glass. When
looking for real ruby glass, make sure the color is in the batch of
glass and not just stained on the outside because it was dipped or
flashed in a dye.''

 &HT;    CLINTON TRIAL IMPERILS REST OF CONGRESSIONAL AGENDA
 &HT;    With CONGRESS-LIST. For release Saturday, Jan. 9.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton
will slow efforts by leaders of the new Congress to pass major
legislation, members and outside analysts agree.
</P>
<P>
   The delay won't necessarily kill chances of passing proposals to
save Social Security and Medicare, or reaching compromises on
issues such as defense and education spending, but it certainly
won't help, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a presidential election coming up in 2000, and that
usually freezes parties into positions that showcase their
stands,'' said political scientist Joseph Cooper at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the window for getting things done is probably nine or 10
months at most,'' Cooper said. ``The most likely result is that
nothing important will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress-watcher Sarah Binder at the Brookings Institution, a
nonpartisan research center in Washington, was slightly more
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangely enough, (incumbents in) both parties might have
incentives to reach agreement on Social Security in 2000, so they
won't have to face the voters without anything to brag about,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she agreed that ``productivity is unlikely'' for other
reasons, such as the ``terribly slim majority margin'' that
Republicans have in the House and sincere differences between
Republicans and Democrats over the best way to handle such
challenges as education, managed health care, tobacco, trade and
banking.
</P>
<P>
   Binder said the effect of impeachment-related delays will be
minimized by the fact that the trial is coming just as a new
Congress convenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing much of substance comes to the Senate floor in January
or February anyway,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Committees must get organized, fill out their staffs, hold
hearings and draft bills before the Senate or House even considers
a bill. The process, which involves both chambers and the White
House, is so complex and time-consuming that only eight of the 394
laws enacted in the last Congress were completed during the first
three months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody disputes that action on matters other than impeachment
will be slowed down.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said that until the
impeachment trial is over, the 45 Democrats will block Senate
action on ``important legislative work on matters like education,
health care, Medicare and Social Security.'' That should encourage
senators who want to tackle those issues to concentrate on
finishing the trial as soon as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Democrats block floor votes on legislation, the 55
Republicans can push for progress at the committee level, replied
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we may not be having debate and votes on the floor of the
Senate on bills or on changes in the budget procedures around
here,'' Lott conceded. But he predicted that committee hearings and
meetings held before or after the trial sessions will let senators
``do our very best to get prepared for the regular legislative
process while we're doing our duty with regard to impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it would be hard for senators to concentrate on other
things while they are deciding whether to oust a president,
predicted Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash. For example, Senate and House
committees won't even consider Medicare until Congress receives a
report from the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Because the 17-member commission includes five senators, it will
probably miss its March 1 deadline for finding a bipartisan
compromise, McDermott said. ``For anybody to think that senators
are going to be able to spend much time thinking about this issue
... is overly optimistic to say the least,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With 13 senior House Republicans preoccupied with their role as
managers prosecuting Clinton in the Senate trial, action in the
House also could be slowed.
</P>
<P>
   The trial's effects will persist after it ends, political
scientist Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't Watergate, where there was a public consensus,''
Cooper said. ``No matter what happens, one-third or more of the
country is going to be mad.''
</P>
<P>
   That will make it harder to unify public sentiment around big
changes in either Social Security or Medicare, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton stays in office, Republicans in Congress still won't
trust him, Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, If Clinton is ousted, any honeymoon
period for Vice President Al Gore, who would succeed Clinton, is
likely to be short. ``You're going to be coming into an election,
and Republicans won't want Gore to look too good,'' he explained.

TRAVOLTA, DUVALL TURN `CIVIL ACTION' INTO THOUGHT-PROVOKING
THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fact is invariably more compelling than fiction. Hollywood's
latest proof of that adage is ``A Civil Affair.''
</P>
<P>
   For four-fifths of its running time, it's as good _ probably
better than _ any John Grisham thriller the movies have yet
adapted.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, real-life legal situations rarely end as
dramatically or cathartically as they do in fiction, and this one
doesn't end so much as it just peters out inconclusively. It also
leaves us with several nagging unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it's one dandy legal thriller: unusually
thought-provoking, exceptionally well-acted by stars John Travolta
and Robert Duvall, and so incorrigibly gripping it simply sucks its
audience in like dust into a vacuum cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Jonathan Harr's best-selling book about an early-'80s
lawsuit, it tells the story of a well-off, ambulance-chasing Boston
personal injury lawyer (Travolta) whose small firm stumbles into a
case involving a cluster of child leukemia deaths in the small
Massachusetts town of Woburn.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he wants to blow off what he considers a vague and
unwinnable case, but after talking to the Woburn parents _ who
believe the deaths were caused by contaminated drinking water _ he
comes to believe he can prove the liability of two huge
corporations who dumped toxic waste in the area.
</P>
<P>
   His object is a big settlement, but gradually his greed gets
mixed with empathy for the victims and anger at the polluting
corporations. So, as he becomes obsessed with the case to the point
of sacrificing everything else in his life, the film gradually
becomes the story of the consciousness-raising of a shyster lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   As a morality tale, the film works wonderfully off the
performances of Travolta and Duvall (as one of the opposing
lawyers). Travolta perfectly conveys the hero's conflicting
feelings in a way that always makes his actions sympathetic and
credible, while Duvall gives a splendid portrayal of folksy
corporate evil.
</P>
<P>
   As a thriller, the film soars off the literate script and
story-telling flair of writer-director Steven Zaillian (best known
for penning the script of ``Schindler's List''). Zaillian's bold
cross-cutting flashbacks within his courtroom scenes are especially
imaginative and effective _ and make his material seem fresh and
original.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly because of the influence of co-producer Robert Redford,
``A Civil Affair'' also works as a fairly devastating environmental
muckraker. Its story enrages and scares us, and it's gutsy enough
to use the real names of its corporate heavies _ Beatrice Foods and
the W.R. Grace Co. (Grace is not happy about it, either, and denies
any guilt in the matter.)
</P>
<P>
   The rub is that because Zaillian has held himself so close to
the facts of the case, he obviously couldn't mold or compress its
climax in any way. So his film doesn't conclude with the bang we
expect from the legal thriller genre so much as it whimpers to the
kind of anti-climax that might work in a documentary, but is
naggingly unsatisfying in a drama.
</P>
<P>
   A Civil Action. Directed and written by Steven Zaillian. Cast:
John Travolta, Robert Duvall, Tony Shalhoub, William H. Macy.
Touchstone/Paramount. 110 minutes. Rated PG-13 for mature themes
and language.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+

COMMENTARY: THE CARPET OF CONTEMPT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So here we are at the United Nations. A half-century ago it was
created to keep peace and expand freedom, not a feckless dream but
a reachable goal dear to the United States, the key founding
member.
</P>
<P>
   Now the United Nations is carpeted in contempt for the United
States, for failure to use either its material power or what
remains of its intellectual power to eliminate a minor dictator
with major plans for mass slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Secretary-General Kofi Annan is part of the change
at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Power voids are filled, quickly. Annan moved into the emptiness
created by the failure of American leadership against Saddam
Hussein. He brought into his expanding role great charm and wit,
and a clear concept on how to handle Saddam Hussein _ with diligent
appeasement.
</P>
<P>
   By himself, he has become Saddam's greatest single asset at the
United Nations. And with Russia, China, France and other countries
``sympathetic to Iraqi sentiments,'' as it is put at the United
Nations, he is part of an active coalition, along with selected top
members of the huge U.N. bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition is determined to whittle U.N. arms inspection down
to a useless splinter and lift U.N. economic sanctions on Iraq.
That would open the road for Saddam to reach his goal of chemical,
nuclear and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, the coalition says, look at how many countries
already have the weapons and don't use them. Concentrate on all the
potential trade with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   This coalition does not exist because of its own strength. It
exists because of the absence of American strategy for either
eliminating Saddam's weapon potential or eliminating him.
</P>
<P>
   With its three-day missile attacks, followed immediately by
thinning out American strength in the region, Washington does not
fool itself, Saddam or the United Nations, and certainly not Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Annan is sometimes a subtle man. I do not know what motivates
him to try to appease Saddam. Possibly belief that unless somebody
steps in, American policy will lead to disaster for all. Possibly
the deep layer of Third World allegiances at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   But his techniques are not subtle. Each time Saddam ties up or
throws out U.N. inspection, in violation of its peace agreement
with the United Nations, Annan waits a while. Then after lots of
secret hocus-pocus he pulls out the solution _ a new agreement in
which Saddam again promises to cooperate with inspection, and again
gets a good-boy reward, a weaker inspection system more acceptable
to Iraq, for a while.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, promise broken, same Annan show of
compassion, the same hocus-pocus solution and promises; so on.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton government does not criticize him. After all, it
fought to get him named secretary-general, and usually gives its
approval before and after his routines with Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he praised Saddam's government for its ``wisdom,
courage and flexibility'' in February 1998, there was no criticism
_ not even when he signed a ``Memo of Understanding'' with Iraq
endorsing Saddam's indispensable lie. The memo says that
``paramount'' to the people and government of Iraq is removal of
sanctions against Iraq. Annan knows sanctions would quickly be
eased and ended if Saddam carried out his 1991 promises to reveal
his concealed weaponry and plans, within 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   The reports from the inspectors headed by Richard Butler of
Australia reveal Saddam's concealment. That is why Annan and Iraq
are so intent about weakening the commission, why stories are
floated that Butler's inspectors are U.S. spies _ to weaken the
inspectorate so badly that Butler will resign.
</P>
<P>
   As long as those Butler reports keep coming, Annan and other
Iraq friendlies know the United States will veto lifting of
sanctions. Probably _ is that creaking and cracking we hear in
Washington's support for sanctions against the Iraqi tyranny?
</P>
<P>
   The American public, as always, must share responsibility with
its elected government on what it does or does not do.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the reports by U.N. inspectors about Saddam's
concealment, despite his decision to force Iraqis to suffer
sanctions rather than reveal his weapons of mass destruction,
Americans seem entirely relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there was the World Trade Center bombing. But you don't
really think terrorists would also use anthrax over here, actually
use it?

TEXANS SPENDING LESS ON STATE LOTTERY, SURVEY FINDS  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Plenty of Texans still play the lottery, but
they report spending 28 percent less on the state-sponsored
gambling games than they did two years ago, a new survey shows.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Lottery Commission received a copy of the study of
typical lottery players Thursday, shortly after announcing that
actual lottery sales had fallen 18 percent since the fiscal year
began in September. The decline represents how much sales dropped
from September to Jan. 2 of this year, compared with the same
months the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to try to bring back some of the core players that
we have lost,'' Toni Smith, the lottery's marketing director, told
commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Big drops in lottery sales coincided with the onset of a 1997
legislative mandate that lowered instant-ticket prize payouts,
officials say. The Legislature also reduced spending for marketing
and advertising for the games.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the players themselves have changed but rather
that their behavior has, according to the recent survey conducted
by the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Findings in the study were consistent with similar ones
conducted in 1997 and 1995, with one noteworthy exception, the
lottery's executive director, Linda Cloud, noted in a letter to
state leaders and legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most striking result, a change from previous demographic
studies, was the decrease in the amount of reported spending,''
Cloud said. ``Reported play for all games, with the exception of
Pick 3, was down for the period covered by this 1999 report.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new report, the typical player of Texas Lottery games
reported spending $457 annually, or about $8.79 per week, on all
lottery products, or 28 percent less than the 1997 study revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see among the games which is holding its own in a
more aggressive way,'' said Lottery Commissioner Tom Clowe Jr. of
Waco. ``If our biggest game is off the greatest, that's more
alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, that's exactly what an analysis of sales shows. Sales
of the instant-ticket games fell most sharply, by 29 percent.
Meanwhile, the contribution of instant games to total lottery sales
sank from 60 percent last year to only 52 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The next biggest loser was the Cash 5 on-line game, which saw a
28 decrease in sales. Lotto Texas sales, meanwhile, dropped 6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can do is acknowledge the reality of where we are and
do what we need to do to address it, pragmatically and openly,''
said Lottery Commissioner Anthony Sadberry.
</P>
<P>
   The survey included interviews with 1,720 Texans at least 18
years old and has a margin of error of 2.4 percent. Average
household income in the sample was $37,960. Females slightly
outnumbered males in the survey. Whites made up 64 percent of the
sample, Hispanics 23 percent, African-Americans 10 percent and
other groups, 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The survey revealed that about 68 percent of adult Texans bought
at least one Texas Lottery ticket last year, down slightly from 70
percent in a 1997 survey. Those with incomes between $30,000 to
$49,000 were most likely to play the games, as were those with some
college education. About 73 percent of Hispanics said they played,
versus 67 percent of Anglos and 65 percent of African-Americans.
Houston reflected the norm with 67 percent of adults buying lottery
tickets, while Victoria had the highest concentration of players at
74 percent.

FREEZERS HAVE BECOME ECONOMICAL, ENERGY-SAVING CONVIENCES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 10) (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Keeping foods frozen today is a snap. Freezers
have become economical, energy-saving conveniences.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as the weather turns cold in the Northeast, sales of
some models increase. The spike in freezer demand follows
deer-hunting season. All that venison has to go somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   If you simply have a large family or entertain a lot, you might
consider investing in or trading up to a new chest or upright
freezer _ for the sole purpose of freezing food in quantity.
</P>
<P>
   Freezers generally work the same way as refrigerators, with a
compressor to generate cold air. Manual-defrost freezers contain a
compressor and thermostat. Frost-free freezers contain a
compressor, defrost timers, heaters and a thermostat.
</P>
<P>
   A freezer generally keeps your foods frozen harder than the
small freezer compartment of a single-door refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``A complete freezer model, whether upright or chest, keeps your
food at 0 degrees or slightly below or above, anywhere to 25
degrees,'' according to Dan Oliver, contract sales representative
for Earl B. Feiden appliances in Latham. ``Freezing is at 32
degrees. Small manual defrost compartments in refrigerators never
reach 0 degrees, and that's why you can't keep ice cream hard.''
</P>
<P>
   However, manufacturers have added a few enhancements to make
each style of freezer a bit more attractive and functional, such as
safety devices and more energy-saving efficency. The extras
generally raise the cost of a freezer, but the first consideration
is size.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Ventresca, brand central manager for Sears in Colonie, said,
``People basically look for a specific capacity and size, based on
space restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   They range in size from just under 5 cubic feet to 23 cubic feet
in a chest model, and approximately 5 cubic feet to 20.3 cubic feet
in an upright.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chest freezers cost less to run a year, because they are more
efficient in that when you open the door, most of the cold air
stays at the bottom,'' Ventresca said. ``With an upright, you lose
cold air every time you open the door.''
</P>
<P>
   A chest freezer costs about $30 a year to operate, a non-frost
upright $54 a year, and $77 annually for a frost-free upright,
Ventresca said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some upright freezers, like Sub-Zero, provide the option of
refrigerated shelves,'' Oliver said. ``They also come with separate
adjustable storage bin drawers at the bottom, interior lights and a
lock.''
</P>
<P>
   Locks not only ensure that the freezer is closed all the way,
but prevent children from opening the freezer or falling in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are also controls or indicators to monitor the
temperature,'' Oliver said. ``One of the best safety features is an
alarm to alert you to a power outage and the fact that the
temperature is dropping to a level that your food is thawing or
defrosting.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Sears Kenmore freezers feature a signal light in the
freezer's door handle. Ventresca said that because a freezer door
is almost always closed, you wouldn't necessarily know if the power
was out in there.
</P>
<P>
   Some models have a system that produces dry air to prevent
excessive freeze/defrost cycling, keeping frozen foods good for a
longer period of time.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference between upright and chest freezers is that
the latter must be defrosted manually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your chest freezer should always be defrosted when you exceed
a 1/4-inch thick layer of ice on the shelf,'' Oliver said.
</P>
<P>
   Defrosting can be a chore, trying to empty melted frost, but
many newer chest models have a plug on the front near the base,
which can be hooked to a spigot and garden hose to drain defrosted
water into your sump pump, utility sink or bucket.
</P>
<P>
   Some models, such as Sears Kenmores, feature a flash defrost
knob to activate a heating element, cutting defrost time in half.
</P>
<P>
   Under-counter freezers are popular for kitchen islands and wall
counters. They come with drawers or a door and generally feature
auto defrost.
</P>
<P>
   All freezer models come in white. Some manufacturers offer a
variety of finishes to match the decor of your kitchen or wet bar
area.
</P>
<P>
   There are stainless-steel models, as well as classic framed
models in a variety of wood finishes to match the rest of the
cabinetry in your kitchen. Costs range from about $200 to $800 for
a chest model and $200 to $1,000 or more for an upright.
</P>
<P>
   According to an industry forecast by the Association of Home
Appliance Manufacturers in Chicago, sales of chest freezers were up
16 percent for 1988 and upright freezers were up by 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, we find that here in the Northeast that the balance
of freezer sales is still the strongest in the upright models,''
Ventresca said. ``It's about 60 percent upright to 40 percent chest
freezer.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true for freezing store-bought groceries. But every
year, there comes a demand for chest freezers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always sell a lot of chest freezers during the fall and
early winter,'' Oliver said. ``Hunters buy them to store their deer
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales on freezers can be found by shopping around throughout the
year. You can work on the final total by looking for 0 percent
financing charges, clearance sales and free delivery.

COMIC BOOK CHARACTER INSPIRES STRONG FEELINGS IN CONGO 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ They still fight over his legacy, from Paris,
where legislators will soon mark his 70th birthday by debating
whether he was a rightist or a leftist, to this city formerly
called Leopoldville, where he had his defining adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Tintin, the 16-year-old boy-reporter extraordinaire of the
Belgian comic book series, journeyed to the Belgian Congo in 1930
and taught the Congolese, among other things, how to tell right
from wrong, how to share and how to avoid superstition.
</P>
<P>
   A stylistically innovative comic book, ``Tintin au Congo''
became a troubling cultural artifact banned for years in Europe and
in this country, where the book still inspires strong,
unpredictable reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tintin was an agent of colonial rule,'' said Salumu
Yamba-Yamba, a follower of Patrice Lumumba, a Marxist and Congo's
first prime minister after independence in 1960. ``He was a
mouthpiece for those who dominated us. It was not innocent. We read
Tintin when we were young, but now we understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Yamba-Yamba sat in a gazebo inside the mountainside villa of
Christophe Gbenye. What did the former rebel leader, who held the
city of Stanleyville, now Kisangani, for five months in 1964, think
of Tintin? ``It was just entertainment for children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Political comments about a beloved literary character might
surprise readers in the United States, where Tintin's popularity
has grown. But in Paris, Brussels, Montreal and other
French-speaking corners of the world, where children are fed Tintin
along with their milk, Tintin has always been political.
</P>
<P>
   Before they ever crack open ``The Heart of Darkness,'' many
French-speakers first encounter Congo by reading Tintin. The
enduring appeal of ``Tintin au Congo'' was seized by Sabena, the
Belgian airline, whose recent advertising campaign featured a blond
child gazing down at the cover of the book, with the caption
``Remember your first trip to Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Conrad is usually credited with exposing imperialism's
inhumanity, Herge, Tintin's creator, has been accused of glorifying
colonialism. About 15 years after the story was first published in
a magazine in 1930, Herge, whose real name was Georges Remi,
expressed regret for some of its contents and made changes _ most
famously in a scene where Tintin teaches a classroom of children.
</P>
<P>
   In the original, Tintin points to a map and says, ``My dear
friends, today I will teach you about your fatherland: Belgium!''
</P>
<P>
   In the revised version: ``Who can tell me what 2 plus 2 are?''
</P>
<P>
   But the politically incorrect passages were so numerous that
Herge, who died in 1983, would have had to scrap the entire book to
appease his critics: The Congolese speak in broken French even as
Milou, Tintin's faithful terrier, speaks in French that would make
the French Academy proud; the Congolese are drawn as black as coal
and with exaggerated facial features; Tintin even offends animal
lovers by butchering scores of now endangered species, at one point
by drilling a hole into a rhinoceros and dynamiting it to bits.
</P>
<P>
   With the stirrings of African nationalism in the 1950s, Herge's
publisher practiced self-censorship, and ``Tintin au Congo'' was
unavailable in Europe, according to ``Herge,'' a biography by
Pierre Assouline. (In the United States, the book has never been
translated into English or offered for sale by Little, Brown,
Tintin's American publisher, which sells 122,500 copies a year of
the 21 other books in the series.) But since the 1970s, ``Tintin au
Congo'' has been sold freely in the French-speaking world, though
not without the occasional debate.
</P>
<P>
   To mark Tintin's birth _ on Jan. 10, 1929, in a strip depicting
his adventures in the Soviet Union _ the French National Assembly
is to debate whether the real Tintin was the colonial apologist and
fierce anti-Communist of his early adventures, or the quasi-Third
World revolutionary of his last adventure.
</P>
<P>
   There is probably much truth in Sabena's campaign that to many
Westerners ``Tintin au Congo'' remains their ``first trip to
Africa.'' Indeed, it might be many Westerners' only trip to Congo,
since tourism to this war-ravaged country has dwindled to almost
nothing in recent years _ unless you count international relief
workers, arms smugglers and shady diamond dealers, not to mention
the Rwandans and the Ugandans who are backing rebels trying to
depose President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sadly for those interested in gauging the reaction of the
Congolese to ``Tintin au Congo,'' Sabena was unable to kick off its
Tintin campaign in Congo because it coincided with the recent wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our best customers have fled the country, and we would
have given them the Tintin posters,'' said Max Mukubu, Sabena's
marketing director in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   Most who had actually read Tintin were men in their late 40s and
50s, who had grown up under colonial rule and attended schools
operated by Belgian priests. These children belonged to the class
known as ``les evolues,'' or ``those who have evolved'' _ elite
Congolese given special identification cards, and privileges, by
the Belgians.
</P>
<P>
   Decades after reading ``Tintin au Congo,'' Dr. Kabamba Mbwebwe,
chief of the emergency room at Kinshasa General Hospital,
remembered entire scenes from the book. He recalled how the
Congolese mangled ``monsieur,'' addressing Tintin as ``missie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think that Herge wanted to ridicule us and
invalidate our own culture; others are more philosophical and think
he just wanted to make money,'' Mbwebwe said. ``I'm in the second
group.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, consider another reader, a deflated colonel inside
his air-conditioned den, slumped in his rattan armchair, his
slippers arranged neatly to his left, his favorite wooden carving
of a woman without limbs _ titled ``Pourquoi?'' _ to his right. The
colonel was also asking himself ``why'' on this day, for the Kabila
government had recently dismissed him and 314 other civilian and
military magistrates in Kinshasa, all holdovers from the Mobutu
era, for gross corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption? The colonel waved it away with his hand, evidently
too depressed to consider the idea. But when he stopped the
television remote on a cartoon and a visitor asked him whether he
had ever read Tintin, the colonel brightened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tintin! Milou! The captain!'' he said, rattling off characters
from the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the book is insulting to the Congolese,'' the
colonel said. ``I think Herge wanted to faithfully depict the Congo
of that period. If the typical Congolese spoke French poorly back
then, what was he supposed to say? That he spoke it well?''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard She Okitundu, Kabila's minister of human rights, said he
remembered Tintin fondly, though he believed that the book played a
role in making it easier to discriminate against the Congolese.
Feelings toward Tintin, he said, were as complex as those toward
the colonial era, when foreigners ruled the streets, but the
streets were paved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am at the same time attracted and repulsed by Tintin,'' he
said.

SENATE TRIAL OPENS BUT NEXT STEP IS UP IN THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL And JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate launched the impeachment trial of
President Clinton on Thursday with a solemn ceremony and
fast-moving negotiations within a divided Senate about what the
lawmakers should do next.
</P>
<P>
   With Chief Justice William Rehnquist presiding, each of the 100
senators swore an oath to render impartial justice and then, one by
one, each lawmaker signed a book attesting to the oath.
</P>
<P>
   At the motion of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
Rehnquist then adjourned the trial indefinitely, clearing the way
for continued consultations by Lott, Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D., and other senators as they tried to find agreement
on what should come next.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the Senate would vote Friday on rival plans for trial
procedures, including whether to permit witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We we want to be careful to do it right because what we are
doing is historic,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle added: ``We have attempted to try to find a way with
which to proceed in a bipartisan fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said wrangling over trial procedures
``reflects the concern among Democrats and Republicans that we find
something we can agree on. Neither party has an appetite for having
this process begin with a partisan vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the historic Senate trial _ only the second time
in U.S. history that a president has faced such a process _ began
when Senate Sergeant-at-Arms James W. Ziglar intoned: ``Hear ye,
hear ye, hear ye. All persons are commanded to keep silent, on pain
of imprisonment.'' This was the same proclamation used at the
outset of the Senate trial of President Andrew Johnson in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   After the House prosecutors were invited into the chamber, House
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., barely looking at
his Senate audience, read the articles of impeachment to the
100-member Senate charging Clinton with perjury and obstruction of
justice in connection with a cover-up of his sexual dalliance with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., acting as president pro tem of the
Senate, administered an oath to Rehnquist, the official designated
by the Constitution to preside over any Senate impeachment trial of
a president. Thurmond is a 96-year-old lawmaker first elected to
the Senate in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist, wearing a black judicial robe with four gold bands on
each arm, then administered an oath to the 100 senators. Rehnquist
asked each senator to raise his or her right hand and pledge to
provide ``impartial justice'' during the proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate clerk read aloud each senator's name in alphabetical
order. Each state's two senators rose at his or her wooden desk to
declare: ``I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Each senator then walked to the ornate well of the Senate to
receive a pen to sign the ``oath book'' attesting to their action.
Each senator kept the pen as a souvenir of the first impeachment
trial of an elected president in the nation's 210-year history.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of one or both of the articles of impeachment by
two-thirds of the Senate, Clinton would be automatically removed
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said Clinton did
not watch the televised proceedings. The president was working
upstairs in the residential quarters of the White House when the
Senate trial began and was having his weekly lunch with Vice
President Al Gore in the private dining room off the Oval Office
while Rehnquist administered the oath to members of the Senate,
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid signs that senators were still working to find a bipartisan
agreement on arrangements for the trial, Lockhart said the White
House remained confident on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are convinced we can make a compelling case that will lead
the United States Senate not to remove the president,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an about-face designed to stem demands for witnesses, the
White House agreed for the first time to ``stipulate'' to the
accuracy of 7,000 pages of grand jury testimony and other evidence
accumulated by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr and the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the White House would agree to the action only if
the Senate agreed not to summon Clinton to testify and only if
there was no new evidence allowed at the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors have prepared a list of potential witnesses
that includes Lewinsky, presidential confidante Vernon Jordan and
presidential secretary Betty Currie _ all key figures in an alleged
sex-and-cover-up case assembled against Clinton by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said that if Senate Republicans opened the door to
witnesses, the White House would insist that the Senate work out
rules governing depositions of witnesses, discovery proceedings and
possible motions before the trial could begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you're in a trial in the Senate or you're in traffic
court ... you cannot have a process that's fair to someone involved
in that process where the rules get made up as you go,'' Lockhart
said.

   The trial blueprint circulated by Lott called for House
prosecutors to begin presenting the case against Clinton next
Thursday followed by the presentation of Clinton's defense. Lott's
plan opened the door to senators calling witnesses to testify
before the Senate, with a vote on calling each individual witness
after the two sides had presented their cases. Lott said the trial
could end by Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, a member of the bipartisan
six-member team negotiating a trial plan with Democrats, said White
House agreement to stipulate to facts in the transcripts could
alleviate the need for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate must avoid ``a replay'' of the lurid sexual detail
that emerged in the Starr report, Stevens said, adding: ``I have
serious reservations about bringing Monica Lewinsky to the floor of
the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats and the White House oppose calling witnesses.
Daschle's trial plan calls for a vote at the outset on whether
witnesses will be permitted.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During his 27 years on the Supreme Court _ 27 years
to the day, coincidentally _ William H. Rehnquist's working life
has followed a steady rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   On the first Monday of each October, a new court term begins.
New cases are granted or denied. Arguments are heard, votes taken,
opinions drafted, and by the Fourth of July the docket is clear and
the cycle is ready to start again. The outcome of particular cases
is not necessarily predictable, but the overall pattern certainly
is; the court's calendar, specifying days on and off the bench, is
printed a year in advance.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday the chief justice of the United States left the
court and ventured into the unscripted and unknown. So did the rest
of the country, of course, but for Rehnquist the shift was
particularly abrupt. In crossing the street from the court to the
Capitol, to preside over the Senate impeachment trial of President
Clinton, he left a sanctuary where the rules are clear _ and
clearly enforceable by him _ and entered a realm of uncertainty
verging on chaos, where even the broad outlines of what happens
next, let alone the precise details, are glaringly unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's Senate proceedings, although strictly ceremonial,
offered a taste of disarray to come. While Supreme Court sessions
always begin on time, and the chief justice arrived at the Senate
on Thursday well in advance of 1 p.m. _ the hour at which his
formal oath-taking was scheduled _ Senate president pro tem Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., did not call the Senate to order until 1:20.
</P>
<P>
   By the Senate's clock, such slippage is entirely unremarkable.
But by the court's, it is almost unthinkable, an eternity. The
chief justice has been known to interrupt lawyers in mid-syllable
to tell them their time has expired.
</P>
<P>
   But if Rehnquist was in any way nonplused by the unfamiliar
setting, he gave no sign. Television viewers saw him Thursday as
spectators do in the television-free courtroom: confident,
imperturbable, his countenance displaying little reaction to his
surroundings, his bland Midwestern accent a legacy of a childhood
in the Milwaukee suburbs that he left behind at age 19 en route to
becoming a man of the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers also saw the judicial robe with the four gold stripes on
each sleeve that the chief justice, in a flight of whimsy or
perhaps out of boredom with basic black, designed for himself four
years ago. A fan of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operettas, he
modeled the robe on a costume worn by the lord chancellor in a
local production of ``Iolanthe.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Now 74, Rehnquist was a lawyer and an active Republican campaign
worker in Phoenix, his adopted hometown, when he was recruited to
work in the Justice Department during the Nixon administration. He
was assistant attorney general in charge of the Office of Legal
Counsel when President Richard M. Nixon named him to the court.
Rehnquist had previously served at the court as a law clerk to
Justice Robert H. Jackson after graduating first in his class from
Stanford Law School in 1952, a class in which Sandra Day O'Connor,
now a colleague on the court, finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Of the current justices, he is the only one who had never been a
judge, although 13 years after joining the court he got a taste of
trial experience by arranging to preside over a civil case in a
U.S. District Court. He is also one of the few veterans of the
Nixon administration still active in public life. President Ronald
Reagan named him to be chief justice in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The climate has changed substantially since his early years on
the court. Rehnquist occupied the far right of the spectrum then,
frequently as the lone dissenter. These days he usually speaks for
a majority, dissenting in only 10 of the 91 cases the court decided
in its last term. The chief justice adheres to views he has held
for many years, the difference being that he now has a majority
that generally agrees with his approach to criminal procedure, in
which the prosecution usually prevails; his belief that the federal
government is one of limited powers; his sympathy for the states in
contests between state and federal authority, and his view that
government can rarely if ever legitimately take race into account.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highest end which the state can serve is to serve no end
at all, but merely exist as a means for the individuals within it
to realize their own ends,'' he wrote in his master's thesis for
the Stanford University political science department in 1948. Fifty
years later, he would be unlikely to dissent from that statement.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Natalie Cornell Rehnquist, died of cancer in 1991,
shortly after he finished a book about impeachment. The book,
``Grand Inquests'' (William Morrow, 1992), is much in demand for
any clues it might give to the chief justice's approach to his
current duties. While it provides few such clues, it does offer a
rare glimpse into his heart. In a dedication to his wife, he wrote
that ``to me, she represents the interested and informed nonlawyer
for whom the book is written,'' adding that ``working with her on
the book has made it a true labor of love.''

LICENSING PUTS JOHN LENNON DRAWINGS ON BABY BOOMERS' BABIES 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Great Britain)   By CONSTANCE L. HAYS  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With baby boomers as serious about their children and
grandchildren as they were about their music, maybe it's not so
farfetched to think that John Lennon would find a second career in
the layette department.
</P>
<P>
   That's the hope, anyway, at William Carter Co., the 134-year-old
manufacturer of baby apparel in Morrow, Ga. Carter Co., now owned
by Investcorp, recently paid an undisclosed amount for permission
to use the whimsical drawings of animals and celestial objects
Lennon created for one of his sons on its pastel-toned pajamas,
bedding, wallpaper and other products for the youngest consumers,
newborns to 6-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Lennon is said to have come up with the drawings to help teach
his son Sean _ now a musician in his own right _ to read. The
introduction of the clothing, along with a book to be published by
the Random House unit of Bertelsmann A.G., is scheduled to coincide
with Father's Day; the two projects mark the first time the
drawings will be widely seen, said Lynne Clifford, director of Bag
One Arts Inc., which is owned by Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family seems to be disintegrating, not just in the U.S.
but all over,'' Ms. Clifford said. ``So it's a particularly good
time for this message. Lennon was the original Mr. Mom. He took the
time to sit and draw with his child.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lennon drawings are but one example of the art-licensing
boom that has been gathering steam in the last several years. While
still less than 10 percent of the $71 billion retail licensing
market, art licensing rose 3 percent last year, to $5.4 billion,
said Martin Brochstein, executive editor of The Licensing Letter,
an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Other estates that have profited from it include those of
artists and musicians like Miles Davis, Frank Sinatra, Jimi
Hendrix, Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol, said Peter Shukat, an
entertainment lawyer whose firm has handled many of the deals.
</P>
<P>
   The art winds up on neckties, coffee cups, area rugs and
T-shirts, among other products. There seem to be at least two
driving forces behind the popularity of art licensing, Shukat said.
``You're talking about quality images and drawings and creations,
which is why people want it,'' he said. ``I don't think it would
sell based just on the name alone.''
</P>
<P>
   But second is the desire of people to own a small souvenir of a
beloved work or the artist responsible for it. ``People have
determined that musical artists are multidimensional people, and
they want to own a piece of their rock-and-roll hero,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the interest in Lennon, who died in 1980 after being shot
outside his home in Manhattan, Shukat added: ``I don't think it's
recycling. It's showing a different side of John Lennon, the time
he spent with Sean.''
</P>
<P>
   Artists, meanwhile, have come to regard licensing in a less
negative light in recent years _ in part because museums have
helped fuel an industry of posters, greeting cards and other
take-home products generated by retrospectives and other shows of
important art.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that licensing was this very declasse function
that a lot of artists stayed away from,'' Brochstein said. ``But it
has gained a certain amount of legitimacy, away from what artists
thought of as a schlocky sort of mercenary, low-rent usage of art,
toward becoming part of life style. It can be done poorly, but it
can also be done well.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of what makes art licensing rise or fall is the way in
which the original work is interpreted in the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes these things just don't work,'' Brochstein said.
``If you put a Picasso cubist image on a T-shirt _ I just don't
know. There has to be a kind of union between the product and the
image that makes sense. You can't force it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Carter's, the decision to link with John Lennon's art grew
out of a desire to combine lofty ideals with some more hard-boiled
realities of the retail business. ``We thought it would help us
drive more creative, artistic expression in our products,'' said
the company's chief executive, Fred J. Rowan II, who also plans to
open Carter's boutiques inside larger retailers. ``And he had mass
appeal. But we don't want this to be a Lennon launch. It's a
Carter's launch.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowan said that a renewed focus on children was coinciding with
Carter's push to redefine itself with the new clothing line, in
which the company plans to ``celebrate imagination,'' a word with a
strong Lennon tie-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The birth rate is very good,'' Rowan said. ``But even more
important is the growth of grandparents and younger grandparents.
It's projected to escalate over the next five years. And there are
a lot of grandparents on both sides, because of divorce, and they
are big spenders.''
</P>
<P>
   With corporate brands responsible for the single biggest segment
of licensing, will it be long before corporations and artists get
together, resulting in, perhaps, the licensing of a Cezanne still
life to market frozen peaches? It probably won't ever get to that
point, Brochstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to see the Picasso-of-the-month on
the Wheaties box,'' he said. ``Maybe you'll see a Warhol on a
Campbell's soup can. Kind of art imitating life imitating art.''

JUDGE DENIES GRAHAM'S PETITION FOR A NEW TRIAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ED ASHER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A federal judge Thursday rejected Gary Graham's latest
legal maneuver to escape execution Monday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge David Hittner denied Graham's petition for a
new trial, ruling that he did not follow procedure in filing it.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's attorney, Richard Burr, said he will appeal immediately
to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans, but he
does not expect the court to rule until Monday. He said he will go
to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's far from over,'' Burr said. ``We are moving every stone
that can be moved to be sure he is not killed before he has a fair
hearing of innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham is scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection
shortly after 6 p.m. CST Monday. Graham's case has attracted
support from actor Danny Glover and filmmaker Spike Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Burr asked Hittner to order the state to hold a new trial so
Graham could present new evidence of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was convicted and sentenced to death on the testimony of
one eyewitness,'' Burr said. ``We have since found six additional
eyewitnesses, all of whom say the person they saw commit the
killing looked quite different from Gary Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   Burr argued that Graham's lead attorney at his 1981 trial, Ron
Mock, failed to challenge the state's eyewitness and failed to call
alibi witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Hittner did not rule on the petition's merits.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he agreed with state attorneys that he did not have
jurisdiction to consider the petition because Graham failed to get
the 5th Circuit's permission to file it.
</P>
<P>
   Hittner agreed with the state that Burr's request was a
``subsequent petition,'' or second petition, because he denied a
similar petition by Burr in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal court rules, ``subsequent'' petitions must be
approved at the appellate level before a district judge can
consider them.
</P>
<P>
   Burr argued that his request was not a subsequent petition, but
a continuation of the 1993 petition.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr. said he wished Hittner had
ruled on the merits of Graham's petition, but was otherwise
satisfied with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The petition didn't have any merit in our view,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys with the Texas Attorney General's Office, representing
the state in Graham's appeals, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was condemned for the capital murder of Bobby Grant
Lambert during a 1981 robbery in Houston. An eyewitness identified
Graham as the killer in a police lineup and at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   One eyewitness has ``declared that Mr. Graham was not the
gunman,'' Burr said in court papers, and that five people could
have testified that Graham was with them miles away when the
shooting occurred.
</P>
<P>
   He also contends that a firearms analysis confirms that the
fatal .22-caliber bullet was not fired by the .22-caliber pistol
owned by Graham. Burr says Graham's jury never heard this evidence.

<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ New York Jets coach Bill Parcells says no team
has yet requested permission to talk to defensive coordinator Bill
Belichick. Belichick is expected to take over the Jets when
Parcells leaves the sidelines, but he's been rumored as a candidate
for the Patriots' head coaching job (among others) after New
England completes its ``evaluation'' of Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I do know is this,'' said Parcells. ``There is a policy
in place in the league that requires people asking for permission
to talk to a coach to file that request with the league office and
then transmit it to the team to which that person is employed. They
are able to do that for a head coaching position at any time, not
just when the playoffs are over. I have yet to receive any
communication in that regard. But I don't know. I don't have a
crystal ball about the future. But I know the league requirements
and I'm going to be the first to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells tried to bury the topic. When it resurfaced later in
his daily press session, he said, ``Is this relevant to this game
(Sunday's playoff game against Jacksonville)? I don't really feel
like talking about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he talked about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill and I have a relationship. It's existed for a long time.
If anything came up, we would sit down and talk it over and we
would come to some agreement. He's done a great job for me over the
years. I like to think I've been helpful to him, too. But we would
sit down and talk about it and come to some opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bill first went to work for me with the Giants, after one
year, he was under contract and had the opportunity to interview
with Minnesota for another job. I didn't have to let him go do it,
but I did. And then he turned the job down and came back. At that
time, I thought it was the fair thing to do. And now if something
came up, we would talk about it. But right now this is all
conjecture. This is all hypothetical. So I don't know what I would
do or how I would react. When and if it occurs, I will have an
opinion on it and I will be happy to share it with you then, but
right now that's the name of that tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``He studies well, he prepares well, he does a good job with the
team. I think he has a good support system with Al Groh and Romeo
Crennel. They've been together a long time. Not much is wasted in
the translation. And that's one of the advantages when you've been
with guys a long time. You just say, `We need to fix this,' and we
all know what we're talking about.''

<P>
   PAILIN, Cambodia _ With the toot of a trumpet and a ragged
salute by 300 soldiers in rubber sandals, Khmer Rouge defectors
raised their new government's flag Thursday to mark the darkest day
in their history: the overthrow of their brutal government 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was an act of humiliation _ but also of political calculation
_ that shocked many of their followers here in the remote and
ragged mountain town that over the past year has become a
self-contained enclave of former Khmer Rouge leaders and
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with a dozen residents, it was clear that even
though the town has begun to open up to the modern world and
officially has put the past behind, most people here support the
Khmer Rouge leadership.
</P>
<P>
   And despite recent defections to the government, the area still
forms a separate, undigested and potentially troublesome society
within Cambodia. But in the words of the American historian David
P. Chandler: ``The Khmer Rouge never end. They just keep going in a
different kind of style.'' A number of analysts expect the
leadership here to form a new political party.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday is Victory Day throughout Cambodia, the annual
celebration of the Vietnamese invasion that ended four years of
Khmer Rouge rule, during which more than 1 million people lost
their lives under the leadership of Pol Pot, who died in April.
</P>
<P>
   After two decades more of guerrilla warfare, the Khmer Rouge
have finally given up the fight, put on government uniforms and
pledged allegiance to whatever they were asked to pledge to.
Thursday's celebration, their leaders said with barely concealed
distaste, is a gesture of obedience to the government in Phnom
Penh.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gesture that rang hollow to their numerous followers in
Pailin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me like cutting our own throats,'' said a woman
named Ra, who is still dedicated, in her heart, to the Khmer Rouge
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get it,'' said a man named Mey Mann, once a colleague
of the young Pol Pot. ``What are they celebrating again?''
</P>
<P>
   This dusty gem-mining town is now home to some 40,000 former
guerrillas and supporters and is the refuge of most of the top
leaders who could be subject to trial for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Most prominent among these are the former Khmer Rouge head of
state, Khieu Samphan, and the movement's chief ideologue, Nuon
Chea, who surrendered two weeks ago, and the former foreign
minister, Ieng Sary, who was the first to give up the struggle in
mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   The last units of guerrillas surrendered in early December. Only
one senior figure, the battlefield commander Ta Mok, remains at
large.
</P>
<P>
   The Khmer Rouge are no longer a potent military force. But about
2,000 former guerrillas are stationed here, now wearing ill-fitting
government uniforms. They could make any attempt to arrest their
leaders extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Pailin also has geography on its side, surrounded by mountains
and forests and pressed against the border of Thailand, where Khmer
Rouge leaders have been given sanctuary for years.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everybody interviewed here was opposed to the idea of
putting their leaders on trial _ some of them belligerently so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot allow it to happen,'' said Y Chhien, who was the
local Khmer Rouge commander during the war and was given the title
of governor when he defected in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his men would fight to protect their leaders from
arrest, he said: ``Yes, it's true. If outsiders don't want Cambodia
to have peace, they would be troublemakers who could create war.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the major defectors appeared at Thursday's ceremony, at
which Y Chhien addressed soldiers as well as 300 schoolchildren in
dirty white shirts who sat under the rain trees chatting and
passing snacks around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were a real celebration, you'd see hundreds of people
here and they wouldn't have to be invited,'' said Pheng Phen, who
has taught Khmer Rouge schoolchildren since 1986, when their
parents were at war and they often fled from one jungle hideout to
another.
</P>
<P>
   Many things have changed, he said. The children of Pailin are
now given lessons that conform neatly with the catchwords of Khmer
Rouge defectors like Khieu Samphan: Let's forget the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to teach about how the Vietnamese aggressors invaded
our country,'' Pheng Phen said, describing a central motive for the
Khmer Rouge fighters. ``But now that chapter of our history is
closed, and we don't teach it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said, there is nothing at all about the Khmer Rouge
period in the new textbooks issued by the central government. This
is apparently an effort to heal the country's rifts, in the
Cambodian way, by ignoring them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have neutral language that doesn't attack
anybody,'' Pheng Phen said.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Pailin seem to view the rest of the country _
their lifelong enemy _ with a mixture of truculence and longing.
They voice pride in the discipline and austerity of their
revolutionary lives, but their once-bare walls are newly decorated
with pictures of waterfalls, motor bikes, bathing beauties and
Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   From a society that was once forced to wear only black, the
small crowd of people who watched Thursday's ceremony were adorned
in the most vivid mixtures of lime green, pink, yellow and every
color in the crayon box.
</P>
<P>
   But the discipline of the Khmer Rouge years remains in force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe here, not like other places,'' said a pickup-truck
driver from the nearest city, Battambang, 50 miles away. ``If
you're caught stealing something here, they don't put you in jail;
they just kill you. You never hear gunshots here. Just sometimes
mine explosions.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Mey Mann, the friend of Pol Pot, said it was necessary to
implant a system of justice here, but added, ``It's a little bit
difficult because it is in their habit to use violence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people here are violent, but they are disciplined
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the discipline, Pailin's sudden opening to the outside
world seems to have brought with it the same hurly-burly of social
infections that has degraded the culture of the former Soviet Union
_ corruption, money-making, gambling, prostitution and social
cleavages.
</P>
<P>
   Once a drab and barren wartime town, Pailin has quickly become
gaudy and crass, every other building a nightclub, karaoke bar or
brothel.
</P>
<P>
   At night, young women from other parts of the country saunter
down the unpaved streets, their faces covered with white powder in
the manner of Cambodian prostitutes. Well past midnight, when even
these women have disappeared, the only sound is the yearning voice
of a young former guerrilla singing a karaoke love song.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should kick these prostitutes out,'' said the woman named
Ra who sells food from large aluminum pots at the town's scruffy
marketplace. She said she was happy to speak her mind but asked
that only her nickname be used in case she made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, things were good during the last 20 years,'' she
said. ``No thieves, no beggars, no bandits, no corruption, and no
one went hungry. Now many people don't even have rice to eat. And
now our leaders forget us. They forget that we struggled together.
All they think of is nightclubs, casinos and fancy hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she said, life was hard when her husband, a soldier, took
the family running through the jungles. On the other hand, ``people
loved one another and helped one another whether we had food or
not. Now it's all money.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she remained loyal to the top Khmer Rouge leaders, whom
she called incorruptible. ``I don't believe they were mass
killers,'' she said with a smile, when asked.
</P>
<P>
   The recent defectors, Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea, are welcome
here, she said. ``Whatever happens, we will not forget them,'' she
said. ``They led us for many years. I feel strongly about this.
I'll go visit them whenever I'm allowed to. They fed us since 1979
even when there was nothing to eat. They led people to struggle for
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   With this kind of support, the Khmer Rouge leadership is in a
position, if it chooses, to open a new stage in its revolution by
entering the political arena.
</P>
<P>
   Y Chhien said the leadership in Pailin had ``not yet'' decided
to form a new political party, a move that is widely expected among
political experts.
</P>
<P>
   The party line here is well thought out and consistent: Pol Pot
(who being dead is unavailable for trial) was responsible for
everything; much of the killing was done by lower-level officers
who lost control; there is blame to be shared by the United States,
which bombed Cambodia, and by the country's current leaders, who
also engaged in human-rights violations; the accusations against
Khmer Rouge leaders are false.
</P>
<P>
   Mey Mann, who is 78, said that if Khieu Samphan and Nuon Chea
were arrested, ``I believe they have mouths to talk'' and could
implicate many other people and nations in Cambodia's hardships.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people both here and elsewhere in the country, he said
he could not see the benefit in a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they say this man is right and this man is wrong, my
children won't come back from the dead,'' said Mey Mann, who lost
three children and a son-in-law during the Khmer Rouge years. ``So
there's no benefit in it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But like many other Cambodians, he said he regretted that Pol
Pot had died before he could be brought to trial to explain
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things in his behavior that I do not
understand,'' he said. ``When I knew him as a young man, he was not
like that. He was a happy man. He was polite.''
</P>
<P>
   Their first acquaintance was when they left by ship from the
Vietnamese port of Saigon in 1949 to study in France, Mey Mann
studying public transportation and Pol Pot _ whose name then was
Saloth Sar _ radio engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all got seasick together,'' Mey Mann said. He said he
shared Pol Pot's revolutionary ideas but chose not to follow him
into the jungle to carry them out with violence.
</P>
<P>
   After the Khmer Rouge seized power, Mey Mann said he lived a
harsh life and, like many Cambodians, came to hate the mysterious
figure named Pol Pot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I saw a film in 1977, and I saw that Pol Pot is Saloth
Sar,'' he said, ``and I thought: `Why? What's going on? Why is he
so cruel?'''

NBA, PLAYERS KISS AND MAKE UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The NBA and the NBA Players Association exchanged wet
kisses in public Thursday, tossed bouquets to their fans, and
announced plans to play a 50-game season with or without Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the owners approved Wednesday's 11th-hour deal that
ended the six-month lockout and did so unanimously. ``We are happy
to be back in business,'' said Celtics chairman of the board Paul
Gaston. ``But I know there's a long road ahead to win back our
fans. We're going to work at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the nuggets offered up were the following:
</P>
<P>
   --The season will start Feb. 5 and consist of 50 games, running
into the first week of May. Deputy NBA commissioner Russ Granik
said a schedule won't be available until after the deal is reduced
to writing, which may take 7-10 days. Teams can expect mostly
in-conference games, with perhaps 6-8 nonconference games. There
will be instances of three games in three days, something that
hasn't happened in years but was commonplace in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   --Each team will play two exhibition games, one home, and they
will be free to the public. Each team also will have one open
scrimmage for the fans. The league left the logistics up to the
individual teams. In addition, all teams have been directed to
offer 500 seats to every game at $10 a ticket, something which will
go into effect next season if this year's seats have been sold. The
Celtics already offer around 1,300 $10 seats for each home game.
</P>
<P>
   --The playoff schedule will be the same, with the last possible
date for the NBA Finals June 29 or 30. Why not longer? ``It's due
to our lack of desire to play in July and the network's (NBC's)
lack of desire to show us in July,'' Granik said. He added no date
has been set for the draft, usually in the last week of June.
</P>
<P>
   --On Monday, all team facilities will open for players to work
out, shoot around, exchange high fives, and, in the case of the
Celtics, get measured for IVs. The league feels that with almost a
month of workout time, the players will be less susceptible to
injury. Until camps officially open, no one from the coaching staff
is allowed to be present when the players are practicing (yeah,
right). ``We don't want to be a police state,'' Granik said, ``but
that would result in a huge fine.''
</P>
<P>
   --Once the deal is reduced to writing and there are no
unexpected delays or bombs, camps will open. Granik said the
earliest that would be is probably Jan. 15. At the same time, teams
will be allowed to sign players.
</P>
<P>
   Granik, commissioner David Stern, and union executive director
Billy Hunter appeared together at a press conference following the
owners' vote and made the predictable statements about rebuilding
the game's image and how they really didn't dislike each other.
Stern called the union ``a formidable adversary,'' and Hunter, who
is looking more like Neville Chamberlain to many agents, called the
deal ``a win-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have some winning back of the fans to do and we're
going to do it,'' said Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about numerous polls which say fans don't care that the
league has settled and have lost interest, Stern said, ``The proof
will be in the pudding. A lot of fans remain NBA fans. We're
comfortable that if we work hard, we can redeem ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter may have some serious fence-mending ahead of him with the
agents. Marc Fleisher, whose late father, Larry, was the union's
first and foremost executive director, pronounced the deal
``somewhere between horrible and awful. I told my wife that my
father is spinning in his grave.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher said the deal was the worst he has seen in at least 15
years and possibly longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling,'' he said. ``The money these players had a
week ago, they don't have anymore. I don't know anybody who likes
it (among his peers). I for one would have preferred not to have a
deal than to have the one that's there. And it's there for seven
years. It's really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher went on, ``It's too bad they couldn't translate the
union's early unity into some gains. But David just sat back and
said, `I'm not giving anything.' And the union couldn't convince
the players that his threat to cancel the season was a bluff.
Anyone with half a brain knew he was bluffing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern, asked if he was bluffing, said simply, ``You didn't pay
to find out.'' Utah owner Larry Miller said he was ``absolutely
convinced'' Monday that the season was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Several important details of the agreement still need to be
worked out, such as a trading deadline and a window to sign players
like Antoine Walker to contract extensions. Gaston was very up
front about not paying Walker so-called ``Garnett money''
($120-plus million) under the terms of the old deal. He was asked
Thursday if the club was more inclined to re-sign its star now that
Walker could earn ``only'' $85-plus million over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get too specific, but this deal, if it gets
approved (after being reduced to writing), does make the playing
field more competitive,'' Gaston said. ``All the teams are in the
same boat. I don't know if there's anything easy about paying
anyone'' the kind of money Walker would command.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jordan, his situation is starting to look a lot like Bob
Dylan's at Woodstock. Is he here? Will he be here? Dylan never did
show, and Jordan so far has remained incommunicado, apparently
while playing golf in the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf said he had not spoken with his
franchise player since July (that's what he's supposed to say) and
that he needs to get Jordan's situation resolved before he goes to
work on free agent Scottie Pippen. (Jordan wants Pippen's status
clarified first, a classic Catch-22. Said Reinsdorf, ``We've
navigated those waters before.'')
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf also said he spoke to coach Phil Jackson Wednesday
night, and Jackson repeated that he is not coming back. Ergo, Tim
Floyd is now the coach. Is that OK with Mike?
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael has not proposed another coach,'' Reinsdorf said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Jordan, Stern said, ``One of these days, Michael
Jordan is going to retire. It is sad but inevitable, whether it's
this year, next year, or in 10 years.''

BRAZILIAN MARKET TUMBLES AFTER POLITICIAN'S STATEMENT ON DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Brazilian stock market tumbled Thursday after the governor
of one of the country's largest states said he would not make debt
payments to the central government for 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Itamar Franco, the newly installed governor
of Minas Gerais state and a former president of Brazil, surprised
investors and reminded them how bumpy the road to spending and tax
reforms will be in Brazil and other emerging-market countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a demonstration that the Brazilian stability-adjustment
reform effort is a two-step forward and one-step backward
process,'' said Arturo Porzecanski, chief economist for the
Americas at ING Barings.
</P>
<P>
   The Bovespa stock index in Sao Paulo fell 5.1 percent to
6,954.17. Traders and analysts said the threat of problems in
Brazil also pulled the dollar lower and weighed on the American
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Brazil was seen as the last bastion against the
deepening of the financial crisis that had pushed key American
stock indexes down by 20 percent. Economists thought a devaluation
of Brazil's currency then after Russia had defaulted could lead to
a worldwide recession.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund, the United States and other
countries assembled a $41.5 billion rescue package, which helped
calm things down last fall. In a positive note Thursday, the World
Bank approved the distribution of two loans that are part of the
package.
</P>
<P>
   But the threatened default could make it even more difficult for
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to reach the spending
and deficit goals the country must meet to qualify for more
payments from the rescue package. Even if the reform plan succeeds,
many economists think Brazil is headed into such a sharp recession
that a currency devaluation may still be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is worrying but it is good that we get it out of
the system right now and that Cardoso appears to be strong,'' said
Susan Gilbertson, head of Latin American Research at Paribas.
</P>
<P>
   In other emerging-market news, the government of the Philippines
sold $1 billion of a global bond issue. Investors eagerly snapped
up the bonds because their interest rates were so high. For
example, the 10-year note had a yield of 9.123 percent, almost
twice the yield on the 10-year Treasury note. The lead underwriters
were J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Warburg Dillon
Read.

 &HT;    WHITE HOUSE WARNS SENATE TRIAL COULD GO ON ``FOREVER AND EVER''
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON The White House Thursday sought to prevent witnesses
from appearing at President Clinton's Senate impeachment trial,
warning that the proceeding could go on ``forever and ever'' if
they do.
</P>
<P>
   In a high stakes bid to prevent Monica Lewinsky and other
witnesses from taking the stand , Clinton's lawyers offered to
stipulate to the evidence presented against him, provided that no
witnesses are allowed to testify at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   If witnesses are permitted, however, the result could be a
protracted trial that goes on ''forever and ever,'' predicted White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart. He warned that Clinton's attorneys
could file a raft of procedural motions that could lead to extended
delays.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who aides said did not watch Thursday's televised
proceedings, made no public comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was scheduled to vote Friday on an overall plan for
proceeding with the trial. At the heart of a Republican plan is a
proposal that the Senate vote separately on whether to call each of
the witnesses, based on the substance and value of their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd have to vote on every witness,'' said Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who said he took a dim view of any plan
to rule out witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the Senate should specify up front what the ground
rules of the trial will be, so that the president can prepare a
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether you're in a trial in the Senate or you're in traffic
court,'' said Lockhart, ''you cannot have a process that's fair to
someone involved in that process where the rules get made up as you
go.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Look,'' said Lott, ``all we want is a fair process that gets
to the truth. I think it's wrong if you say at the beginning,
'Absolutely no witnesses.'''
</P>
<P>
   Pressing its case for just such a system, the White House
proposed a deal to Senate leaders Wednesday night under which
Clinton's lawyers would stipulate to the evidence the House has
forwarded to the Senate _ but only if witnesses are prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   In legal terms, to ``stipulate'' simply means to accept evidence
for purposes of a trial. It is not an admission of guilt, nor does
it imply agreement with the evidence or any conclusions reached
from it.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, the president's lawyers would not contest the
evidence presented against Clinton in some 7,000 pages of reports
that the House submitted to support articles of impeachment
charging Clinton with perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers would, however, contest the conclusions
reached by the House from the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president's legal team can make a forceful
case against conviction even if it stipulates to the evidence
against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe, even based on this record, that we can make a case
that there's no constitutional or legal ground to move forward,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   In a thinly-veiled threat, Lockhart warned that a trial with
witnesses would likely be lengthy _ something a number of senators
from both parties have said they want to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The House members who Republicans elected to be the floor
managers of the impeachment trial have pressed for witnesses,
saying they are necessary to confront the Senate with the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the House managers insist on calling witnesses...they will,
in effect, extend this process and delay this process, because
</P>
<P>
   bringing witnesses in and not stipulating to a record opens up a
whole area of motions, discovery and depositions. And that
</P>
<P>
   takes time,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're talking about a process that is open-ended and could go
on forever and ever,'' Lockhart told reporters. ''And we are not
willing _ or we are not anxious, because it is not our decision _
to put the country through that.''
</P>
<P>
   The witness issue is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ''Witnesses may be the most important remaining factor in
determining the conclusion of the impeachment process,'' said
constitutional law expert Jonathan Turley, professor of law at
George Washington University in Washington. ''Witnesses transform a
congressional event in a way that's very dangerous for the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of seeing former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
testifying before the Senate about her intimate relationship with
Clinton could capture the focus of the nation in a way not seen
since Anita Hill's testimony in the 1991 confirmation trial of
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, Turley said.
</P>
<P>
   That could turn a process now widely seen as an exercise in rank
partisanship into a national inquiry into Clinton's conduct, with
an engaged public _ not just the Senate _ sitting in judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ''They may approach this exercise as a process of determining
guilt,'' said Turley. ''If that is the reaction, the president may
in fact be removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans run the risk of being seen as overzealous, running a
partisan witch-hunt instead of a sober impeachment proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's national job approval ratings hovering near 70
percent, even some Republicans have voiced fears of appearing to
flout the public will. They are concerned they might pay a
political price for that in presidential and congressional
elections two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Those fears would appear to explain at least part of the
motivation behind Lockhart's suggestion that a witness trial could
languish for months.
</P>
<P>
   A lengthy trial, however, could also pose grave risks for
Clinton, said former independent counsel prosecutor Bruce Yannett.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they hope to get is an expedited resolution of this,''
said Yannett, a lawyer with Debevoise &AMP; Plimpton, a New York law
firm.
</P>
<P>
   A protracted trial, said Yannett and Turley, poses the following
risks for Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   New revelations could emerge about Clinton's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum for impeachment could build as the result of testimony.
It could remind the public and the Senate of the details of
Clinton's acknowledged transgressions more vividly than the cold
text of past reports.
</P>
<P>
   Public sentiment could possibly turn in the face of prolonged
paralysis of the government; cries for Clinton's resignation could
mount.
</P>
<P>
   Public aversion to the process could shift from Republicans _
who appear to be bearing the brunt of the blame from a public
deeply split over the impeachment process itself _ to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   That could happen, Turley warned, if Clinton's lawyers launch an
aggressive campaign of legal maneuvering and delay tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lengthy trial may increase the view of the citizens that
this president's conduct has paralyzed the government,'' said
Turley. ''If the image of the president is an opportunistic
criminal defender trying to win an acquittal, he will not survive
as president.''

MEGGETT CRITIQUE OF PATRIOTS ANYTHING BUT CASUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Dave Meggett is a Jet. He's back with Bill
Parcells, the man who coached him in two Super Bowls. Meggett is
one of ``Bill's guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Meggett is also an ex-Patriot who witnessed the decline of the
New England football operation from inside the locker room. He was
with the Pats under both Parcells and Pete Carroll. Most recently,
he was on the New York sideline when the Jets annihilated the
Patriots two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Getting dressed before practice Thursday, Meggett aimed some
darts at Carroll's casual coaching style.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have been good for a few more years,'' he said.
``They wanted to get this nucleus of young players. That's not bad,
don't get me wrong, but you've got to have the right guy to
motivate the talent. And the guy they have is not the right guy to
motivate young players. He's the kind of guy you could have with a
veteran team _ a laid-back guy: (itals)`We gonna get it done. You
know how to get it done.'(unitals) That was his approach. But you
can't have a young team and have that kind of leadership. It
doesn't work. I can tell you the truth because I've been around
both. I've been around Parcells, Ray Handley, Dan Reeves, and all
the success I've had has been with the guys that are like Parcells
with the younger guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Patriots) are not ready for that kind of laid-back
environment. We'd go to practice with shoulder pads for five
minutes, then take 'em off, and then everybody's running through
the motions. You can't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meggett's blast proves that the Patriots are getting to be more
like the Red Sox every year. He sounds a lot like Roger Clemens, Mo
Vaughn, Jim Leyritz, or Mike Greenwell ripping into Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know about Pete Carroll,'' Meggett said. ``I
don't care about Pete Carroll. I don't really know about Bob Kraft.
I don't care about Bob Kraft. I just know that I played with the
guys in that locker room and I feel bad for the guys. They have
better than what they are playing like. They really do. I talk to
Shawn Jefferson about every day. I talk to Troy Brown every day. I
call Ben (Coates) all the time. There's frustration. They're not
putting the blame on anybody. But in the game against us, I felt
that they gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were humiliated by the Jets, 31-10, in their final
regular-season game at the Meadowlands. On Sunday, the AFC East
champion Jets take on Jacksonville, a team that humbled New England
last weekend. Meggett, who was dumped by the Pats after his arrest
on charges of assault and theft in Canada last year (the assault
charge was dropped), joined the Jets for the final two weekends of
the season and is back in the playoffs with Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for the (Patriot) players,'' he said. ``I don't
feel bad for the administration or the coaches, but I feel bad for
the players. It's a tough situation when an owner would develop an
ego. He's got the stadium and he's got everybody in the community
excited about it. He's got the team winning. It could have been a
good thing for a long time. We could have been competitive up
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said it to Mike Gisler (another former Patriot in the
Jet locker room): `There is so much talent and skills on that
team.' They have a lot of good guys that's willing to work hard and
do the things to get the job done. But I feel bad for guys. It's a
shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on the decline. From '96 to now, it's just not going in
the right direction. I know it's not going in the direction that
the players want. You can see the decline. Even though we were 10-6
last year, it wasn't a really good team. We struggled. We were
winning on the residue and the leftover of what Bill had started.
It's terrible. I'm not speaking out of animosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing about what some guys are saying, saying they were
outcoached. That's out of line. They're expressing their feelings,
but that's terrible to say that. And I look over at this (Jets)
sideline. That's how we used to be. But that's not right there. You
know there's a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are shattered, man. And I feel bad for 'em. Those are
guys I love and respect. And I know that they have better than that
in them. We've seen it. I've been there every day with those guys.
But nothing's going to be like that unless they make some
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft and Co. can dismiss this as sour grapes. It's always easy
for a player to rip when he's no longer paid by an organization.
But Meggett was well liked and well respected by his Patriots
teammates. He still talks to many of them. While Bobs Grier and
Kraft go about the business of ``evaluating'' Carroll, they might
want to think about what Meggett said.

FIDGETING? YOU'RE PROBABLY LOSING WEIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To anyone who has ever fought to keep the pounds off, nothing is
more maddening than having a friend or spouse who seems to be able
to eat all they want and somehow burn it all off.
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists at the Mayo Clinic may have an explanation: They
fidget more. Or, more precisely, some people seem to compensate for
eating extra calories by unconsciously increasing the energy they
expend on walking around, standing up, and doing countless other
little things that use up the calories.
</P>
<P>
   And, confirming what many frustrated women dieters have long
suspected, the study shows men seem to do a better job than women
at using up extra calories without conscious effort.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the current issue of the journal Science, researchers
from the Rochester, Minn., clinic describe an eight-week experiment
in which they got 16 volunteers to eat 1,000 calories a day more
than what was determined they needed to maintain their weight.
</P>
<P>
   By quizzing the volunteers about their activities, by recruiting
family members and friends as spies, and by having participants
wear movement-measuring accelerometers for two weeks, the
researchers made sure that no one was surreptitiously exercising.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the eight weeks, the results were startling. Some
people had gained 16 pounds, packing away almost every additional
calorie as fat, while some gained only 2 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Through careful analyses that included special urine sample
tests three times a day, the Mayo researchers determined that some
people were burning up as much as 70 percent of their increased
calories through non-activities other than exercise, while other
people, particularly women, responded by moving around less.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really couldn't find anything that seemed to be a good way
to explain why'' some people's activity level increased so much
more than others, said Michael D. Jensen, who did the research with
Norman L. Eberhardt and James A. Levine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who were burning a lot of extra calories were doing
it in the activities of daily life,'' Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, the four women volunteers in the group of 16 showed the
lowest levels of increase in movement other than exercise. It was
not enough to prove anything scientifically, but enough to suggest
that it would be worth testing whether there is a gender-based
difference in how men and women respond to extra calories, Jensen
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Eric Ravussin of Eli Lilly and Co.
and Elliot Danforth Jr. of the University of Vermont said that
while ``gluttony and sloth are frequently blamed'' for obesity,
``the fidgetiness of an individual likely plays a more important
role in daily energy expenditure than previously thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting people to do little things like walk around the office
more, take the stairs instead of the elevator, or put down the
television remote might help curb weight gain, Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing comes close to replacing exercise as a means of
weight control, the researchers suggest. ``Fidgetiness might help,
but it isn't the solution,'' Jensen said.

 &HT;    BOTH SIDES ASSEMBLE BIG LEGAL TEAMS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the impeachment of President Clinton becomes the
trial of the century in the U.S. Senate, both sides will be ready
with large teams of courtroom-tested lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   At the start, the attorney advantage goes to the president. His
defenders can draw both from a White House that's chockablock with
lawyers and from Clinton's private attorney David Kendall, whose
firm of Williams &AMP; Connolly is famous among local prosecutors for
saving clients with scorched-earth legal tactics.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesmen refused Thursday to say how many
government lawyers have been mobilized for the task of defending
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's office of counsel has about 35 lawyers, paralegals and
support staffers, working at a combined annual salary budget of
more than $2 million. Jim Kennedy, the president's legal spokesman,
said that ``relatively few members of the staff'' were working on
the impeachment case, and many of them only part time.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the public-private effort to save this presidency is a
major undertaking. A White House legal response to the impeachment
charges last Dec. 14 listed no fewer than eight attorneys' names,
led by Gregory Craig, the special counsel who was summoned from the
State Department to coordinate Clinton's defense, and by Charles
Ruff, the president's chief counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Costs for the president's government lawyers will be paid by the
taxpayers. Republicans in the past loudly objected to Clinton's use
of his staff to defend him in the various Whitewater
investigations, but they are not complaining now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it gets to impeachment, I think the issue is joined,''
said C. Boyden Gray, who was chief counsel in the Bush White House.
``It's OK to defend impeachment with taxpayer funds.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton will also mount up more IOUs to Kendall, whose
scowling visage has been prominent throughout Clinton's legal
difficulties. Kendall's $400-an-hour rates are paid by the
president's legal defense fund, which has consistently fallen
behind as legal costs have soared.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, when President Andrew Johnson was impeached 130
years ago, he paid his own team of five lawyers. The fee was $2,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Clinton impeachment, the president will
face 13 House ``managers,'' members of the House Judiciary
Committee who will conduct the case in the Senate. The
all-Republican team led by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
J. Hyde of Illinois is made up of lawyers, several of whom are
experienced prosecutors who frequently speak of their own trial
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The House committee has a backup team of 18 attorneys, including
eight hired to deal with the impeachment investigation, who will
help develop the case in the Senate. David Schippers, the blunt
Chicago Democrat brought in to lead the House investigation, is
coordinating the prosecution staff.
</P>
<P>
   The House investigation, budgeted for $1.2 million, cost an
estimated $900,000 last year. For the Senate trial, the House this
week voted to spend money ``as needed'' for legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   If the trial grows into a lengthy proceeding with witnesses to
depose and cross-examine, Senate Democrats may also seek legal
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Abbe Lowell, the Washington lawyer who was the lead attorney for
the Democrats in the House investigation, said Thursday that
``Democrats could use help in learning about the evidence'' if the
trial is prolonged.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell said he has been providing Democratic senators and their
staff with information about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all waiting'' to see what happens next, he said.

RETAILERS REPORT MERRY DECEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boosted by strong shopping in the week before and the week after
Christmas, many retailers reported solid December sales figures
Thursday, but the full results of the 1998 holidays may not be
known until retailers release earnings next month.
</P>
<P>
   Based solely on December sales, the season's apparent winners
included discounters, the Gap, and the Internet. Most department
stores were laggards, and some luxury retailers, which soared in
recent years, did just a bit better than so-so.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street had predicted holiday sales would grow a respectable
4 to 6 percent, and a composite index compiled by Bloomberg News
using December sales figures showed that results should be in line
with those expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Ames
Department Stores Inc. outpaced department stores, with moderately
priced stores such as the Gap Inc. also posting impressive gains.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet merchants did even better.
</P>
<P>
   December sales at Sendwine.com increased about tenfold, from
about $100,000 to about $1 million, said Michael Lannon, founder of
the Web site in Waltham, Mass. at which consumers can buy wine as
gifts for friends and business associates.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the world of brick and mortar, mild weather in early
December forced many apparel retailers to cut prices on winter
clothing before a recent cold snap drew shoppers to their stores.
</P>
<P>
   Most retailers build some price-cutting promotions into their
seasonal business plans, but when traffic is slow, retailers
sometimes start slashing prices in desperation. Such unplanned
promotions can erode profits.
</P>
<P>
   In December, ``there were lots of promotions,'' said Kurt
Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report. ``And profits
are likely to take it a little bit on the chin.''
</P>
<P>
   For Barnard, December results underscored a trend that's been
unfolding for more than a year: Consumers may be spending freely,
but they're drawn to stores with the lowest prices.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, department stores, whose prices generally fall in
the middle range, seem to be losing customers to lower-price rivals
such as BJ's Wholesale Club, Target, and Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Not all department store chains reported results as
disappointing as Sears, Roebuck and Co. and J.C. Penney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Federated Department Stores Inc., operator of the Macy's chain,
and May Department Stores Co., operator of Filene's, both reported
solid December sales increases.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, affluent consumers enriched by the
stock market have splurged at luxury retailers in December.
</P>
<P>
   December 1998 was more of a mixed bag. Both Saks Holdings Inc.
and the Neiman Marcus Group posted 3 percent gains for stores open
for more than a year _ a respectable number, but well below the 8.8
percent gain that Neiman Marcus enjoyed in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Weaker catalog and apparel sales held back overall performance,
said Neiman Marcus vice president Peter Farwell from the company's
Chestnut Hill, Mass. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Fat cats may not have been buying clothing, but it seems they
were buying jewels. Tiffany &AMP; Co. said overall US sales were up 22
percent for the November-December period.
</P>
<P>
   BJ's had reason to celebrate; sales at stores open at least a
year, or same-store sales, were up 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``December sales reflect strong demand for holiday seasonal
merchandise, including toys, jewelry, and giftware,'' said BJ's
president and chief executive Jack Nugent from the company's Natick
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   After a subpar 1997, Talbots Inc. continued its comeback story
with a 5-percent same-store gain in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our favorable performance in December was due primarily to
continued positive customer response to our regularly priced
merchandise offerings,'' said Arnold B. Zetcher, president and
chief executive of the Hingham, Mass. classic women's clothing
chain.
</P>
<P>
   Offprice apparel retailer TJX Cos. of Framingham, Mass. posted a
4 percent gain in same-store sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are plesed that December's results outpaced our goals,
especially since these results were posted over last year's strong
December sales,'' said Bernard Cammarata, TJX's president and chief
executive. ``In addition, we ended the month with inventories
throughout the company in excellent shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Tweeter Home Entertainment Corp. of Canton, Mass. said new
consumer electronics products such as digital video disc players,
digital camcorders, and digital TVs helped drive a 10.6 percent
same-store gain for the company's fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But if consumer electronics did well, toys did not. Furby may
have been a sensation, but a lack of other toy hits and fierce
competition, from Wal-Mart to toy retail Web sites, may explain why
Toys ``R'' Us Inc. reported a same-store sales decline of 7 percent
for December.

HOW MUCH OF TRIAL PUBLIC WILL SEE IS IN QUESTION

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton
began Thursday in the glare of television, but how much of the rest
of the proceedings will be open to the public remained unsettled or
in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the rules has aroused complaints outside the
Senate, specifically over a provision that may bar the public from
the final deliberative speeches as the senators debate how they
will vote on the evidence that is presented.
</P>
<P>
   The provision has prompted the chairman of C-Span, the public
affairs television network, to ask the Senate to allow coverage of
the entire impeachment trial, including the final speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Lamb, chief executive of the Cable Satellite Public
Affairs Network (C-Span), which is known for its gavel-to-gavel
coverage of Congress, said Thursday that he had not received a
response to a letter he sent last month to Sen. Trent Lott,
R-Miss., the majority leader, asking for a televised trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules adopted by the Senate, after the evidence is
presented, each senator will have up to 15 minutes to express
conclusions about the case. During the impeachment trial of
President Andrew Johnson, such speeches were delivered in closed
session, as they have been during more recent impeachment trials of
federal judges.
</P>
<P>
   It also remains unclear whether other portions of the trial,
like the testimony of witnesses, will be closed, if the senators
can agree on whether any witnesses should testify.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators, like Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have said that to
avoid a public spectacle, witnesses like Monica Lewinsky should
testify in a closed session.
</P>
<P>
   But other lawmakers said the desirability of holding an open
trial was itself a powerful reason to avoid calling any witnesses.
Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., a Senate scholar, said during an
interview with Lamb that ``the trial should be open and will be
open under the rules. This is one reason why we ought not have
witnesses in this particular situation appear.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb said he did not know how the Senate would decide to conduct
the proceedings. Correspondent groups representing news
organizations that regularly report on Congress said their members
supported Lamb, but it was unclear whether any individual news
organizations had sought a change in the rules to open the trial or
the deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any idea what they are going to do,'' Lamb said
Thursday in an interview referring to the Senate. He added, ``We
ought to see it all. The country can handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his Dec. 19 letter to Lott, Lamb advocated television
coverage. He wrote, ``Full and direct access of the public to each
Senator's consideration of the evidence would be consistent with
the openness characterizing each step leading up to the trial,
including the President's testimony before the grand jury, the
House Judiciary Committee meetings and the debate of the full House
on the impeachment resolutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some senators have said the deliberations should be private,
like jury deliberations in a criminal trial. Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, said in a C-Span interview, ``I think the reason why that
rule was enacted was to keep it as like a jury, in a jury room, but
to also get rid of the politics, because if it's public in those
debates then you'll have a number of senators who will use that
occasion to play politics, where if it's private, it may come down
to really what is right, what is wrong here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said the Senate could conduct a
dignified trial in which all phases were open to the public. ``The
current rules provide that the doors of the Senate be open during
this process except during the deliberation phase,'' Dorgan said.
``I think the country's better served by having nothing behind
closed doors at this stage of the process.''

TRAVOLTA, DUVALL TURN `CIVIL ACTION' INTO THOUGHT-PROVOKING
THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fact is invariably more compelling than fiction. Hollywood's
latest proof of that adage is ``A Civil Action.''
</P>
<P>
   For four-fifths of its running time, it's as good _ probably
better than _ any John Grisham thriller the movies have yet
adapted.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, real-life legal situations rarely end as
dramatically or cathartically as they do in fiction, and this one
doesn't end so much as it just peters out inconclusively. It also
leaves us with several nagging unanswered questions.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it's one dandy legal thriller: unusually
thought-provoking, exceptionally well-acted by stars John Travolta
and Robert Duvall, and so incorrigibly gripping it simply sucks its
audience in like dust into a vacuum cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Jonathan Harr's best-selling book about an early-'80s
lawsuit, it tells the story of a well-off, ambulance-chasing Boston
personal injury lawyer (Travolta) whose small firm stumbles into a
case involving a cluster of child leukemia deaths in the small
Massachusetts town of Woburn.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he wants to blow off what he considers a vague and
unwinnable case, but after talking to the Woburn parents _ who
believe the deaths were caused by contaminated drinking water _ he
comes to believe he can prove the liability of two huge
corporations who dumped toxic waste in the area.
</P>
<P>
   His object is a big settlement, but gradually his greed gets
mixed with empathy for the victims and anger at the polluting
corporations. So, as he becomes obsessed with the case to the point
of sacrificing everything else in his life, the film gradually
becomes the story of the consciousness-raising of a shyster lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   As a morality tale, the film works wonderfully off the
performances of Travolta and Duvall (as one of the opposing
lawyers). Travolta perfectly conveys the hero's conflicting
feelings in a way that always makes his actions sympathetic and
credible, while Duvall gives a splendid portrayal of folksy
corporate evil.
</P>
<P>
   As a thriller, the film soars off the literate script and
story-telling flair of writer-director Steven Zaillian (best known
for penning the script of ``Schindler's List''). Zaillian's bold
cross-cutting flashbacks within his courtroom scenes are especially
imaginative and effective _ and make his material seem fresh and
original.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly because of the influence of co-producer Robert Redford,
``A Civil Action'' also works as a fairly devastating environmental
muckraker. Its story enrages and scares us, and it's gutsy enough
to use the real names of its corporate heavies _ Beatrice Foods and
the W.R. Grace Co. (Grace is not happy about it, either, and denies
any guilt in the matter.)
</P>
<P>
   The rub is that because Zaillian has held himself so close to
the facts of the case, he obviously couldn't mold or compress its
climax in any way. So his film doesn't conclude with the bang we
expect from the legal thriller genre so much as it whimpers to the
kind of anti-climax that might work in a documentary, but is
naggingly unsatisfying in a drama.
</P>
<P>
   A Civil Action. Directed and written by Steven Zaillian. Cast:
John Travolta, Robert Duvall, Tony Shalhoub, William H. Macy.
Touchstone/Paramount. 110 minutes. Rated PG-13 for mature themes
and language.

<P>
   Grade: B+

 &HT;    Getting tough carries price tag
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's now time to pay for years of political posturing
and get-tough anti-crime initiatives that seem to come along every
election year.
</P>
<P>
   Though Georgia Gov.-elect Roy Barnes has made transportation and
air and water quality his primary concerns for the 1999 legislative
session, he also is proposing the state spend $66 million for new
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good investment,'' said Corrections
Commissioner Wayne Garner, a former state senator. ``It's a great
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Criminal justice experts warn that there is a crush at every
step through the criminal justice system, not just in prison space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's irresponsible for a Legislature to pass laws and not
think about their consequences,'' said Dr. Susette Talarico,
director of criminal justice studies at the University of Georgia.
``We have more crimes on the books than we need. If we have limited
resources, which we do, we need to think about what we can
afford.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Republican leader Eric Johnson of Savannah said the
question should be whether we can afford not to do anything with
the damage being done by criminals to their victims and to society.
``It's not enough until all the bad buys are off the streets,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But getting all the bad guys off the streets will cost lots of
money, probably hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia needs money for a State Crime Lab that is so far behind
in processing evidence that prosecutors are faced with dropping
drug cases because they cannot support indictments without an
analysis of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia needs money for the courts that are so overburdened in
some circuits that defendants must wait months _ some longer than a
year _ just to plead guilty. A trial date can take even longer.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia needs money for more prisons because there is no more
room left in a system whose inmate population grows daily. With no
room in the state system, convicted felons wait in crowded,
less-secure county jails, burdening local taxpayers with the cost
of housing criminals that should fall to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two-strikes-and-you're-out (law) has done away with a lot
of plea bargaining,'' said retiring state Rep. Denny Dobbs
(D-Covington). ``Our local jails are full. We are at the last of
the prison beds we had in the pipeline. We have a crisis in the
local jails.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs had hoped his committee that oversees the prison system
would have its report and recommendations ready for the 1999
Legislature on the status of the state's criminal justice system,
based on a series of hearings last summer and fall. A consultant
working with the committee is still preparing the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we will have to deal with the whole sentencing issue,''
Dobbs said. ``We need some structure to it. We need to review it.
We've had sentencing inflation like we've had (school) grade
inflation. Justice needs to be what it implies, an impartial judge
sitting there, weighing the facts of that case and deciding what
best serves society. We need to spend more time trying to dispense
justice. Not this one-size-fits-all'' approach.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Rep. Bobby Franklin (R-Marietta) is the only legislator
to pre-file any crime legislation _ a bill calling for life without
parole or the death penalty for anyone who drives drunk and kills
someone.
</P>
<P>
   Republican legislative leaders say they will try to amend the
state Constitution to lock in a year-old Pardons and Paroles Board
policy under which persons convicted of any of 20 crimes will not
be considered for clemency until they have served at least 90
percent of their court-ordered sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do believe that there should be some truth in sentencing,''
said prosecutor Pete Skandalakis, district attorney for the Coweta
Judicial Circuit and president of the District Attorneys
Association of Georgia. ``We would not be opposed to codifying the
90 percent rule, but we do understand that if you codify that rule
there is going to have to be some type of sentencing reform. You're
going to have to compress some sentences. You cannot have this wide
range of one to 20 years on different types of offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say lawmakers must abandon the piecemeal approach to
improving the state's Criminal Code. ``These laws were passed in a
vacuum without looking at the overall impact on the courts, the
district attorneys, et cetera,'' Skandalakis said.
</P>
<P>
   If not enough money is appropriated:
</P>
<P>
   _ Evidence awaiting analysis will continue to back up at the
state Crime Lab.
</P>
<P>
   _ Court dockets will become more congested with defendants
willing to risk a trial rather than accept a plea deal that offers
them little or no chance of ever getting out prison.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pressure will continue to build on county jails that will be
holding more men and women before trial, and even more waiting for
room in the state prison system.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no room in the state system, but as it becomes
more crowded it becomes more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any safety valve we've got is at the breaking point,'' Dobbs
said. ``We're full.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-crime promises sound good at election time _ mandatory
sentences with no chance for parole, life without parole and no
parole consideration until 90 percent of the sentence has been
served. But other government services like education and social
programs can suffer as the full impact of those new laws are felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our legislators have made some attempts at changing things
that will make the public more safe,'' said Terry Norris, vice
president of operations for the Georgia Sheriffs' Association.
``It's oftentimes a reactive measure because of some heinous thing.
We've got enough laws on the books. If we could just enforce the
laws we have and have the provisions to adjust to those needs, we
could do a good job. New offenses on the books isn't always the
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three months, one topic of debate at the state
Capitol will be how to allocate the millions of dollars needed to
keep the state's criminal justice system running.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Buddy Nix, who is
responsible for the state primary forensic lab, said he needs an
immediate $50 million, on top of the current budget of $11 million,
just to handle the current case load.
</P>
<P>
   Three private prisons have opened since the fall, and one of
them is already full. Extra space in state-run prison is virtually
non-existent, and inmates have been sleeping in tents and in common
areas such as day rooms for much of the year.
</P>
<P>
   So Corrections Commissioner Garner has asked for 4,500 new beds
and has tentatively secured federal money to build them all at the
existing prison near Jackson. But once built, state taxpayers will
have to come up with many millions more to staff and run the
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the State Board of Pardons and Paroles and the
outgoing-governor's budget office have estimated Georgia
immediately needs more than three times that many prison beds to
keep pace with the growing inmate population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be very, very careful that we aren't passing
statutes that make the system inflexible,'' said state Parole
Director Chuck Topetzes, who worked for the Georgia Department of
Corrections for 15 years and who developed several court and crime
prevention programs in Wisconsin. ``The hallmark of a good criminal
justice system is one that provides flexibility. Inflexibility will
lead to gridlock.''
</P>
<P>
   Topetzes said further delay could only make the situation worse,
especially for county governments. ``The greatest pressure will be
on the local communities to absorb the backlog of cases. Something
has to give,'' Topetzes said.
</P>
<P>
   County sheriffs are already feeling pressure, and they want
state inmates out of their jails.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Parole Board says Georgia needs
competitive salaries for parole officers, and the state needs to
invest in more work-release centers or halfway houses _
institutions that allow inmates leaving the system time to adjust
to freedom.
</P>
<P>
   With every aspect of the judicial system feeling heat, Johnson
suggests the state may need more alternatives to prison. ``Maybe we
need to shift our resources to putting (only) the bad guys in
longer and not using prison space for the bad check writers and the
drug abusers.''

HARD TO PIN A LABEL ON CELLUCCI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS AND SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Liberal? Conservative? As he's done for 22 years on
Beacon Hill, Thursday Paul Cellucci kept people guessing.
</P>
<P>
   In his 20-minute inaugural address, Cellucci The Liberal laid
out several ambitious goals for his government. He even quoted
Robert F. Kennedy as he hit a series of compassionate themes.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding like the Dukakis Democrats of the 1980s, the newly
elected governor pledged to make all the state's schools
``exceptional'' and to provide everyone with access to affordable
health care.
</P>
<P>
   As he did the day after his election, Cellucci pointedly
distanced himself from the right-wing GOP ideologues on the
national scene, denouncing the ``unyielding partisanship that has
engulfed our nation's Capitol.''
</P>
<P>
   But just when he seemed to have lost his Republican bearings,
Cellucci The Conservative veered back toward traditional GOP
principles.
</P>
<P>
   He talked of limited government and lower taxes, of restricting
government to tasks it does well and leaving other realms to
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   In making those points, it was former President (and
Massachusetts governor) Calvin Coolidge, a recently reburnished
conservative hero, whom Cellucci quoted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not compromise my belief in the values of fiscal
discipline and smaller government,'' Cellucci, vowing to push again
for a massive income tax cut, declared to the lawmakers assembled
in the House chamber.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went, as Cellucci put his own spin on the eclectic
principles that have guided the Republicans since 1991, when he and
Bill Weld came to power. It's an ideological melange, but perhaps
best summed up Thursday by Cellucci in one line in his address:
``There are communial needs goverment cannot neglect. And there are
human dilemmas government cannot solve.''
</P>
<P>
   Shy of details as it was, Cellucci's speech left Beacon Hill
leaders issuing both compliments and questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard to place those generalizations on any
ideological spectrum or context,'' said Senate President Thomas F.
Birmingham, when asked what he could read into the governor's
speech. ``I didn't detect any shift.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, though Cellucci seemed more confident and gubernatorial
than he has since assuming office 17 months ago as a caretake
governor, he gave no signals he will be trying to push the
Commonwealth in a different direction.
</P>
<P>
   There were no clear fresh ideas in the address. In fact, it
could have been delivered in any of the last eight years by either
Weld or Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Cellucci was trying to emerge from Weld's shadow, he is
still in the dark,'' said Lou DiNatale, a senior fellow at
University of Massachusetts' McCormack Institute. ``The tone was
very Weld-like in nature. . . . It is the continuation of the
successful formula of a Democrat in Republican clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideology aside, Cellucci did win some kudos for bringing a new
style to the governor's office. After years of Weld's detached
style, Cellucci showed that his Central Massachusetts roots in an
everyday community may work.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham noted that difference in comparing the two
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   While expressing affection for Weld, whom he described as
``mercurial'' and ``goofy as the day is long,'' Birmingham said he
thought Cellucci might well be more effective. ``Cellucci is not as
whimsical as Weld,'' Birmingham said. ``He is more of a
bread-and-butter, lunch-bucket type.''
</P>
<P>
   But Birmingham also noted that ``platitudes'' Cellucci talked
about may be hard to reconcile with reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil is in the details,'' said Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   One area where that's true could be Cellucci's declaration that
``everyone will gain access to affordable health care.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has provided health care through MassHealth,
formerly the Massachusetts Medicaid program, for children in
families earning less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level
($32,904 for a family of four), and for parents at less than 133
percent of the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   But between 500,000 to 750,000 state residents still lack
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a lot of people who are not going to sign up,
even though they are eligible, and there are a lot of people,
including a lot of low-wage workers, who simply aren't eligible,''
said Michael Miller, policy director of Health Care for All, a
consumer-advocacy organization.

MAYO CLINIC STUDY CITES WEIGHT-LOSS VALUE OF FIDGETING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a couch potato's dream: the announcement, three years
ago, that the Mayo Clinic was looking for volunteers ``willing to
overeat for the sake of science.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only would they have to eat 1,000 extra calories a day for
eight weeks, in the form of favorite foods lusciously prepared and
served by expert cooks, but they would have to make the added
sacrifice of just lounging around, and refraining from exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people, from Ireland, Germany, Canada and even
California, polished their forks and answered the call. But only 16
were chosen, all from Rochester, Minn., home of the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission was to help researchers answer one of life's more
vexing questions: Why is it that some people can eat as much as
they want and stay thin, while others get fatter with every cookie
they swallow?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, the researchers were surprised to find, is that when
people eat too much, some of them burn off extra calories by
starting to fidget and move around more. The added activity is
touched off somehow by the excess of food, and the fidgeters do not
even realize they are doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the researchers described the movements as
``fidgeting,'' they said they were not sure precisely what they
entailed. They may have included things that most people would call
fidgeting, like shifting position in their seats at work, crossing
and uncrossing their legs and sitting up straighter to maintain
their posture. But they also may have included behaviors that came
closer to real exercise, like getting up to stretch or go to the
water fountain or lavatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have fidget monitors, so I can't be certain it's
what you'd call fidgeting,'' said one of the researchers, Dr.
Michael Jensen, an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic. ``But we're
convinced it's something about physical activity.''
</P>
<P>
   A report on the study is being published Friday in the journal
Science. Jensen's coauthors were Dr. Norman Eberhardt and Dr. James
Levine, also endocrinologists at the Mayo Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   None of the participants enrolled in the study was obese; half
said they thought they were ``resistant'' to weight gain, and half
said they had a normal tendency to put on a few pounds if they ate
too much. Women stayed away in droves, though four finally did sign
up.
</P>
<P>
   Levine said he and his colleagues had expected that the study
would end with the conclusion that some of the subjects had a
higher rate of metabolism than others, or shifted to a higher rate
when they ate too much, and burned off the extra calories rather
than storing them as fat.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not the case, according to their extraordinarily
precise measurements of the calories the subjects ate, the calories
they burned and the calories they turned to fat.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks the subjects were studied to determine exactly how
many calories a day they needed to maintain their regular weight.
Then dietitians consulted with each of them to plan menus
incorporating 1,000 extra calories a day in foods they would enjoy.
One subject, Jensen said, took most of his extra calories in the
form of pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had hamburgers, steaks, pancakes, sausages, yogurt,
spaghetti,'' said Kelly Pitts, a graduate student in biochemistry
at the clinic who volunteered for the study. Asked if he had eaten
all those foods, Pitts laughed and said yes, he had.
</P>
<P>
   By Levine's design, the subjects consented to be spied on by
secretly appointed family members and coworkers who would tattle if
they cheated by going for a bike ride or a swim. They were also
grilled via questionnaire about all their activities, though Jensen
said he did not think the questions extended to sex. ``We're still
fairly shy here in the Midwest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects ate most of their meals in the clinic dining room,
where researchers hovered to make sure they cleaned their plates.
From time to time Levine himself took their trash home to his
garage and pawed through it to find out whether they had thrown
away so much as a green bean. They were tested like automobile
engines to see how efficiently they metabolised the food they were
eating. No calorie went unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   The fat content of their bodies was be measured with mortifying
precision, by a special x-ray machine calibrated with a 6 pound
block of human fat left over from someone's plastic surgery. Even
their stools and urine were confiscated, to become the official
property of the Mayo Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a gross-out study in every sense of the word,'' said
Levine.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, after eight weeks of being what the scientists
called ``overfed,'' the subjects had put on an average of 10
pounds. But the gains ranged from 3 pounds to nearly 16.
</P>
<P>
   Since the subjects were assumed to have complied with the ban on
deliberate exercise like running, swimming or even walking, all
that remained was what they termed ``nonexercise activity
thermogenesis.''
</P>
<P>
   When they compared that measure before and during the overeating
phase, they found that it increased more in some people than in
others when they ate too much. Those in whom it increased the most
gained the least weight.
</P>
<P>
   One subject burned off more than 600 calories a day in this
fashion, with an amount of unknown activity that the researchers
said would be the equivalent of ``strolling'' for 15 minutes an
hour during every waking hour.
</P>
<P>
   The four women in the study had the smallest increases in the
nonexercise thermogenesis, and correspondingly large weight gains.
The researchers did not know what to make of it, and said a larger
study would be needed, designed specifically to detect male-female
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months of going back to their normal lives, all the
subjects had lost the weight they had gained during the study,
Jensen said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jensen said, researchers will have to figure out why some
people fidget in response to too much food.``We couldn't find
anything that would predict it or tell us,'' he said. ``We're going
to have to start over and work back to find out what regulates
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, the message of the study is that ``every
little bit of activity counts, even if it doesn't seem like much.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Blackburn, an associate professor of surgery at
Harvard Medical School and associate director of nutrition at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said that the study was extremely
well done and convincing, and the research team ``first class.''
But, he cautioned, people who are not fidgeters by nature should
not imagine that they can transform themselves. Real fidgeters are
born, not made, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he supported the idea that people should get up and move
around more and exercise daily in ways that don't require a trip to
the gym, like taking the stairs instead of an escalator and parking
the car in a spot that will require a bit of walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be a zombie,'' he said.

 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During his 27 years on the Supreme Court _ 27 years
to the day, coincidentally _ William H. Rehnquist's working life
has followed a steady rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   On the first Monday of each October, a new court term begins.
New cases are granted or denied. Arguments are heard, votes taken,
opinions drafted, and by the Fourth of July the docket is clear and
the cycle is ready to start again. The outcome of particular cases
is not necessarily predictable, but the overall pattern certainly
is; the court's calendar, specifying days on and off the bench, is
printed a year in advance.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday the chief justice of the United States left the
court and ventured into the unscripted and unknown. So did the rest
of the country, of course, but for Rehnquist the shift was
particularly abrupt. In crossing the street from the court to the
Capitol, to preside over the Senate impeachment trial of President
Clinton, he left a sanctuary where the rules are clear _ and
clearly enforceable by him _ and entered a realm of uncertainty
verging on chaos, where even the broad outlines of what happens
next, let alone the precise details, are glaringly unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's Senate proceedings, although strictly ceremonial,
offered a taste of disarray to come. While Supreme Court sessions
always begin on time, and the chief justice arrived at the Senate
on Thursday well in advance of 1 p.m. _ the hour at which his
formal oath-taking was scheduled _ Senate president pro tem Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C., did not call the Senate to order until 1:20.
</P>
<P>
   By the Senate's clock, such slippage is entirely unremarkable.
But by the court's, it is almost unthinkable, an eternity. The
chief justice has been known to interrupt lawyers in mid-syllable
to tell them their time has expired.
</P>
<P>
   But if Rehnquist was in any way nonplused by the unfamiliar
setting, he gave no sign. Television viewers saw him Thursday as
spectators do in the television-free courtroom: confident,
imperturbable, his countenance displaying little reaction to his
surroundings, his bland Midwestern accent a legacy of a childhood
in the Milwaukee suburbs that he left behind at age 19 en route to
becoming a man of the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers also saw the judicial robe with the four gold stripes on
each sleeve that the chief justice, in a flight of whimsy or
perhaps out of boredom with basic black, designed for himself four
years ago. A fan of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operettas, he
modeled the robe on a costume worn by the lord chancellor in a
local production of ``Iolanthe.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Now 74, Rehnquist was a lawyer and an active Republican campaign
worker in Phoenix, his adopted hometown, when he was recruited to
work in the Justice Department during the Nixon administration. He
was assistant attorney general in charge of the Office of Legal
Counsel when President Richard M. Nixon named him to the court.
Rehnquist had previously served at the court as a law clerk to
Justice Robert H. Jackson after graduating first in his class from
Stanford Law School in 1952, a class in which Sandra Day O'Connor,
now a colleague on the court, finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Of the current justices, he is the only one who had never been a
judge, although 13 years after joining the court he got a taste of
trial experience by arranging to preside over a civil case in a
U.S. District Court. He is also one of the few veterans of the
Nixon administration still active in public life. President Ronald
Reagan named him to be chief justice in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The climate has changed substantially since his early years on
the court. Rehnquist occupied the far right of the spectrum then,
frequently as the lone dissenter. These days he usually speaks for
a majority, dissenting in only 10 of the 91 cases the court decided
in its last term. The chief justice adheres to views he has held
for many years, the difference being that he now has a majority
that generally agrees with his approach to criminal procedure, in
which the prosecution usually prevails; his belief that the federal
government is one of limited powers; his sympathy for the states in
contests between state and federal authority, and his view that
government can rarely if ever legitimately take race into account.
</P>
<P>
   ``The highest end which the state can serve is to serve no end
at all, but merely exist as a means for the individuals within it
to realize their own ends,'' he wrote in his master's thesis for
the Stanford University political science department in 1948. Fifty
years later, he would be unlikely to dissent from that statement.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Natalie Cornell Rehnquist, died of cancer in 1991,
shortly after he finished a book about impeachment. The book,
``Grand Inquests'' (William Morrow, 1992), is much in demand for
any clues it might give to the chief justice's approach to his
current duties. While it provides few such clues, it does offer a
rare glimpse into his heart. In a dedication to his wife, he wrote
that ``to me, she represents the interested and informed nonlawyer
for whom the book is written,'' adding that ``working with her on
the book has made it a true labor of love.''

SOLEMN TRIAL BEGINS AMID FULL FORMALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Here ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are
commanded to keep silent, on pain of imprisonment, while the House
of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States
articles of impeachment against William Jefferson Clinton,
President of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   With that command, expressed in the booming baritone of James W.
Ziglar, the Mississippi native who is the sergeant-at-arms of the
Senate, the great American drama that began with a flirtatious
encounter in the White House Thursday moved to its final solemn
stage. And the result was an unforgettable tableau, as if a
mezzotint from the days of Andrew Johnson were suddenly made real:
100 senators standing at their schoolhouse desks, hands raised
high, taking a solemn oath to begin the first presidential
impeachment trial in 131 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even for a city of studied tradition, Thursday's events were
remarkable for their formality. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
arrived at the Senate arch at the East Front of the Capitol in a
Fleetwood Cadillac limousine with license plane number 10. An honor
guard of senators escorted him to the front of the chamber. Lloyd
John Ogilvie, chaplain of the Senate, prayed that the Senate find
``procedures that will most effectively resolve the grave matters
before them and our nation.'' The senators who took their ancient
vow by signing the oath book with new pens, which they then put
away for posterity.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this ceremony _ it helps us more fully understand what
we're doing today,'' said Senator James M. Jeffords, the Vermont
Republican. ``When you look at the chief justice sitting there you
know this is a once-in-a-century event.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was a day for history, not histrionics. No words were
permitted. None, in truth, would have done justice. For an
afternoon the Senate put aside what Representative James A.
Garfield, a rising young Republican when President Johnson was
impeached, described at the time as ``the insane love of speaking
among public men.'' The Cave of the Winds, as the Senate sometimes
is called, was quiet.
</P>
<P>
   No lawmaker who was sworn in to judge the president had ever
been involved in anything like it before. Nor had any of those who
yearned to be witnesses to history even been born the last time a
United States Senate contemplated removing a president from the
White House. The oldest man in the room, Senator Strom Thurmond of
South Carolina, 96, was born 34 years after the impeachment of
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we could have ever imagined we would be here
today, doing this,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the
Massachusetts Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before they became members of the biggest jury in the
nation, the senators milled around the floor casually. There was
Senator Judd Gregg, the New Hampshire Republican, slim and tidy in
a pressed gray suit. There was Senator Ernest F. Hollings, the
South Carolina Democrat, his creamy white hair and senatorial
bearing the stuff of Henry Adams' novel of Washington life,
``Democracy.'' There was Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina
Republican, hobbling on a cane after knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   It was like old times. But it wasn't old times. The ``furnance
of impeachment,'' as Senator James W. Grimes called it in 1868, was
about to be lit, and it was clear to everyone in the room that the
trial of the president was also the trial of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And then it began, the 24 minutes that transformed Gregg and
Hollings and Helms and their 97 colleagues into the modern-day
equivalents of William P. Fessenden of Maine, Zachariah Chandler of
Michigan and Roscoe Conkling of New York, senators whose votes and
motives in 1868 are still studied by historians.
</P>
<P>
   The clerk called the roll to determine the presence of a quorom.
One by one the ``ayes'' bubbled forth from the men and women of the
newly seated 106th Congress. Democratic Senator John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts responded with a casual wave to the clerk. Only
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, stood. He
shouted his ``here,'' straightened his suit coat and sat down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was something to see,'' said Gerard Pastore, 21, a
student from Woodbridge, Va., who managed to snag one of the 50
spectator seats. ``It only happens rarely. Only once every 130
years. Unless they create some great advance in gene therapy, I
probably won't be here in 130 years for the next time.'' He spoke
for spectators and senators alike.
</P>
<P>
   And then Thurmond, the president pro tempore of the Senate,
bellowed: ``The Senate will come to order. The senators will take
their seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Two student pages opened the French doors at the rear of the
chamber. Rehnquist, in black gown with four golden stripes on each
arm, began to walk down the center aisle that separates Democrats
from Republicans, and there was a moment of awkwardness in the
room, with a hundred faces befuddled with the same question:
(itals)Should we stand for the chief justice?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Senator Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican, leaned
forward tentatively. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky
Republican in the next seat, put his hands on his knees, as if to
rise to his feet. And in a moment the entire Senate was standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am now ready to take the oath,'' Rehnquist said.
</P>
<P>
   He put his left hand on a leather Bible and swore to ``do
impartial justice according to the Constitution.'' He then asked
all 100 senators to take the very same oath, and they did,
affirming with an ``I do'' as each of the hundred names was called.
It came with a whisper from Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican from
Utah, a quiet assent from Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican
of Texas, a simple lip motion from Senator Harry Reid of Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere a baby wailed. A spectator wheezed. But there was no
other sound. This was a moment none thought would come. All
shuddered from it. None could avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I accept my responsibility,'' Senator Mary L. Landrieu, the
Louisiana Democrat, said later, ``but for many of us this is a hard
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The roll-call continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, Democrat of New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' said Senator Connie Mack, Republican of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' said Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican. As a
Navy flier and a prisoner of war in Vietnam, McCain had been asked
to do his duty many times. ``I just took my oath of office for the
third time,'' he said in a conversation a few minutes after he was
sworn in as a juror. ``I remember the real euphoria the first time
I took it. I haven't felt a bit of that this time.''

CELLUCCI BECOMES 69TH BAY STATE GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Governor Argeo Paul Cellucci, inaugurated as the
state's 69th leader Thursday, promised to improve education, expand
access to health care, and make the state a more affordable place
to live.
</P>
<P>
   But, sounding more like the Republican he is, the 50-year-old
Cellucci also said individuals must take responsibility for
themselves and pledged to refile legislation to lower the income
tax rate to 5 percent, a proposal that is expected to be the focus
of his first year as a full-fledged governor.
</P>
<P>
   With a dozen relatives from Southern Italy there to witness
ascendence of an immigrant's grandson, Cellucci also promised to
shun partisanship, just as President Bill Clinton's bitter Senate
trial was scheduled to unfold in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The former acting governor, who also served as lieutenant
governor, state represenative, and senator, attained the highest
office in the state on a crisp and sunny winter day full of
interesting and telling moments.
</P>
<P>
   He was greeted by death penalty opponents at a morning church
service, a 19-gun salute when he arrived on Beacon Hill, and
partisan applause to the tax-cut proposal in his noontime inaugural
address.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the good-humored ceremonies, there were signs of
political battles ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Only those in the Legislature's minority GOP ranks applauded the
idea of the tax break, while Democrats sat still. Laughter emerged
in the House chamber over the obvious split.
</P>
<P>
   Also, anti-death penalty demonstrators disrupted a morning
church service and rallied in front of the State House shortly
after Cellucci and Lieutenant Governor Jane Maria Swift, the second
woman to hold a statewide office, arrived to a thunderous 19-gun
salute for their swearing-in.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after his speech _ during which he did not mention his
support of capital punishment, which failed to pass by one vote 14
months ago _ Cellucci announced bluntly, ``Now the battle is
joined.''
</P>
<P>
   The powerful House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, a Mattapan
Democrat with a conservative streak, politely shook hands with
Cellucci after the swearing in. But Finneran embraced at least one
strong theme in the governor's remarks: The power of personal
responsibility, rather than government.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, the Chelsea Democrat who
administered the oath of office, said it was ``hard to disagree
with the values that were articulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci sounded similar to former President George Bush in his
``Thousand Points of Light'' speech, repeatedly alluding to smaller
government and the power of the individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every citizen across this state, from the youngest child to
the wisest grandparent, has a role and a responsibility in the life
of this Commonwealth,'' Cellucci said. ``Being admirable mothers
and fathers; contributing to the success of our neighborhoods, our
towns and our cities; and creating and sustaining an atmosphere of
tolerance and respect for each other are tasks individual citizens
perform better than any government ever could.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked . . . the heavy emphasis on individual
responsibility,'' Finneran said. ``He seemed to talk about that
consistently through all phases of the speech _ beginning, middle,
and end. And the notion that we can't get caught up in an
entitlement mentality and a government intitiative for every
pothole that exists in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also exhaulted three citizens, who sat in the front
row, embodying three important points. There was a divorced father,
active in his children's lives, to signal the need for emotional as
well as financial support for sons and daughters; a dedicated
English teacher, whom he praised for her hard work while calling
for higher education standards; and a tireless Chinese-American who
works as a legal advocate for domestic violence victims, showing
how immigrants can contribute to society.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's 75-year-old father, whose own father was born in the
small town of Velletri, Italy, just outside of Rome, said it was
the proudest day of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he ran for state representative, I saw the spark then,''
the elder Argeo Cellucci said, recalling the governor's 1976
campaign. He also noted that the Boston press has ``always
underestimated Paul,'' who worked in his father's new and used car
business growing up in Hudson before attending Boston College and,
later, its law school.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's mother was not at the ceremonies because she was
in the hospital recuperating from a broken hip, suffered after
fainting outside a Boston hotel Wednesday night. ``She's alright,
but she had to stay in the hospital,'' the governor's father said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the House chamber, former Governor William F. Weld,
wearing a red tie and wry smile, watched his one-time partner take
the oath of office at 12:30. Also present were Boston Mayor Thomas
M. Menino, former Governor Edward J. King, University of
Massachusetts President William M. Bulger and former lieutenant
governor Sumner Whittier, who served during the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after Cellucci's swearing-in, Jane Swift of North Adams
raised her right hand and became only the second woman to hold
statewide office. Lieutenant Governor Evelyn Murphy was the first.
</P>
<P>
   As Swift's husband watched from the gallery, flanked by
gubernatorial wives Susan Weld and Jan Cellucci, the 33-year-old
Swift made education and child care the focus of her address.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make overcrowded classrooms and underperforming
schools a thing of the past,'' said Swift, who was the youngest
woman ever elected to the state Senate. ``We will encourage more
adults and accomplished professionals to become teachers. And we
will support programs that promote lifelong learning for veteran
teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``children have dozens of teachers in their
lifetime. Parents, coaches and mentors should all embrace the
responsibilities they have guiding children, helping them to make
good decisions and to achieve their goals.''

 &HT;    McCartney pitches daughter's designs
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The British are here _ this time to peddle home
furnishings _ and leading the sales troops is one of England's most
unlikely candidates, Paul McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta trade show isn't the typical venue for the former
Beatle, but when the event marks the American debut of his
daughter's new line of decorating accessories, well, he just had to
let it be. And designer Heather McCartney, showing her colorful
ceramics, rugs and pillows Thursday at AmericasMart Atlanta, was
beaming with as much pride as her dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this has been a difficult time, so we're drawing on
the energy of her work and moving forward,'' said the 55-year-old
singer, who this spring marks two other milestones _ the first
anniversary of wife Linda McCartney's death and his induction as a
solo artist into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. ``This is what
Linda would have liked, I know that for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCartneys are among an army of visitors in town for the
next eight days for the semiannual Atlanta International Gift &AMP;
Home Furnishings Market, the world's largest decorating accessories
fair, which opened Wednesday. Among the 62,000 manufacturers,
retailers and designers from 80 countries attending the trade-only
show are officials from London's Royal Botanic Garden, Kew, here to
announce an unusual partnership with AmericasMart's manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Garden-inspired accessories are hotter than ever _ the mart
devotes more than 200,000 square feet of showroom space to the
category _ but in the highly competitive world of decorating,
product success depends on high-profile marketing. And that's why
it never hurts to attach a celebrity's name.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was internationally known designer Heather McCartney's
day in the spotlight, but there was no escaping her famous dad's
shadow. The two entered a news conference at Merchandise Mart
holding hands _ him wearing a navy double-breasted suit and bright
blue tennis shoes, her in a gray blazer and black slacks.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of retailers and interior designers shopping at the
market packed the hallways outside the Heather McCartney Designs
showroom for a glimpse of the former Beatle, not her housewares.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, her father emphasized, it was his daughter's day.
</P>
<P>
   The designer, 36, was inspired at early age by her famous
parents' talents and her southwest U.S. upbringing. She studied
drawing, painting, ceramics and photography in England, where her
photography skills reaped one of the country's top awards.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, a photographer whose work was published in ``Linda
McCartney's Sixties'' in 1992, was a major influence, said Heather
McCartney, a daughter by her mother's first marriage, to
geophysicist John Melvyn See. ``All of it _ the color, the
inspiration comes from her.''
</P>
<P>
   The designer's pottery, which involves months of coiling vases
from all natural materials, draws on the influences of the Huichol
and Tarahumara tribes of Mexico, where she once lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met the Huichols some years ago, they introduced
me to many things, including the bold use of color,'' McCartney
said. ``Living with them and seeing how their traditional ways are
threatened by modern times also reminded me of the importance of
protecting them and their environment, which is an aim in all my
designs.''
</P>
<P>
   Her new collection, available in stores by September, includes
handpainted earthenware; wool throws, rugs and pillows; picture
frames and desk clocks _ most in the colors of yellow, blue and
green. Retail prices are expected to range from $20 for a
candleholder to $300 to $400 for a throw.

 &HT;    Trite `Trinity' replacement rehashes old themes
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any show whose narrator quotes Thomas Wolfe saying you can't go
home again is a show you want to be real wary of.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sure sign of some well-worn roads ahead, and
``Providence,'' the teasing, unsatisfying NBC drama that replaces a
more watchable ``Trinity'' at 8 tonight, rattles down most of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence'' isn't proud. It borrows a little dysfunctional
family from ``Trinity'' (``Everybody smile. We're family,
dammit''); a little professional moral dilemma from ``L.A.
Doctors'' (``Life and careers are fragile. Neither should be taken
for granted''); even a little goofy post-feminism from ``Ally
McBeal'' (voice-over of lead character walking down the aisle at
her sister's wedding: ``I know what they're thinking: she's a
doctor, she's still single, she must be gay . . . I've got to
pee'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence'' lashes all this together with a slick, knowing
gloss and . . . doesn't leave a trace. Characters meant to be
complicated are merely muddling. So you're left with nothing at
all, really, except that even nothing on TV requires a title, so
they call this hour ``Providence.'' But it just as easily could
have been called ``Dr. Quinn: Plastic Surgeon,'' or ``Providence,
90210.''
</P>
<P>
   Melina Kanakaredes, formerly of ``NYPD Blue'' and who virtually
defines ``raven haired,'' plays raven-haired Sydney Hansen, an L.A.
plastic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's up first?'' she asks an assistant at the beginning of a
typical workday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Tummy,'' she's told, a reference to a liposuction
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   This is financially rewarding work, but not what she had in mind
growing up a veterinarian's daughter in Providence, R.I. She became
a plastic surgeon after seeing a baby's cleft pallet reconstructed
while she was in medical school. Now she's trying to make Plain
Janes look like Courteney Cox, living in the soaring beach house of
a Hollywood agent boyfriend who's always running off to Spago (be
wary of any L.A.-based show that name-drops Spago).
</P>
<P>
   You see where this is headed: Sydney flies home to Providence
for pregnant sister's wedding, mother dies at the ceremony, father
goes into a funk, screwed up brother and sister need a parent
surrogate.
</P>
<P>
   Take that, Tom Wolfe. You can go home again. Just don't expect
anybody to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providence'' Grade: C

   8 tonight on NBC

 &HT;    `The PJs' foaming with funkiness
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is what networks mean when they say they're trying:
reconfigured California raisins relocated to the 'hood and voiced
by Eddie Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Different? We haven't done the Nexis check, but we're pretty
confident Fox's ``The PJs,'' which debuts at 8:30 p.m. Sunday, then
moves to 8:30 p.m. Tuesdays, marks the first foamation (an update
of Gumby-style Claymation) TV comedy set in the projects.
</P>
<P>
   Does it work? Let's say it promises that it could work, that it
might someday work, that it could make you hope that it might
someday work. Its bloodline suggests it means business: It's
produced by Ron Howard's Imagine Television, which currently
produces critical favorites ``Sports Night'' and ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   This one is trickier.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``King of the Hill,'' Fox's last nonlive-action hit, ``The
PJs'' is so quirkily character-driven that it needs a few episodes
not only to find its own legs, but for viewers to adjust their
sensibilities as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PJs'' is instantly amusing _ man, that looks so weird _
and then very quickly disorienting. You're drawn as much to how
everyone moves and talks as to what they do and say: the
living-Play-Doh mouths, the snaking eyebrows, the Mr. Potato Head
ears. The three-dimensional feel asks a lot more of the eyes than
the flat, depthless animation we're used to from, say, ``South
Park.'' Its pacing often feels about a frame behind, an annoyance
that should iron itself out as everyone gets used to a production
schedule that spits out four seconds of show a day.
</P>
<P>
   As with ``King's'' Hank Hill, everything here revolves around
Thurgood Stubbs (Murphy), the middle-aged, seen-it-all,
bowed-but-unbeaten housing project superintendent. His tenants
generally despise him, while he works for them to keep things
working. Asked if she put anything in the toilet that might have
clogged it, a Haitian woman answers, ``No, no . . . a goat's head
wrapped in paper towels.'' ``No paper towels!'' an exasperated
Thurgood exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   His circle of friends rail and scheme with Thurgood against a
world they at once think they've outsmarted and that continually
confounds them.
</P>
<P>
   This circle includes Sanchez (Pepe Serna), who speaks through a
faulty electronic voice box (``On the outside it looks like I have
it all going on, but inside I am empty''); Jimmy (Michael Paul
Chan), a pompadoured cool cat whose multicolored outfits blend
neatly into walls of graffiti; and Walter (Marc Wilmore), a
pleasant parole officer, who when trying to enter the criminal mind
of two young truants, confesses, ``I don't deal with young
children. I work mainly with their teenage parents.'' Thurgood's
wife, Muriel (Loretta Devine), insists her over-stressed husband
power walk each morning, then bakes him Prozac pies (``Don't you
want two slices every two hours?'').
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's pilot works about as unevenly as Sanchez's in-and-out
voice box; it can't seem to decide whether to play up or down to
its audience. The hope here is it'll eventually stick to the
craftily outrageous, politically incorrect high road blazed by
``The Simpsons'' and ``King of the Hill.'' If it does, an audience
should stick with it.

 &HT;    `Sopranos' in tune with a modern mafia
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I gotta be honest with you. I'm not getting any satisfaction
with my work,'' mafia boss Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) tells a
therapist he's seeing for his anxiety attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have any qualms about how you actually make a living?''
his therapist (Lorraine Bracco) asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Tony answers wearily. ``I find I have to be the sad
clown _ laughin' on the outside, cryin' on the inside . . . I feel
exhausted just talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' the therapist tells him, ``with today's pharmacology,
no one needs to suffer with feelings of exhaustion and
depression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we go,'' Tony sighs. ``Here comes the Prozac.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the new mob of HBO's curiously brilliant ``The
Sopranos'' (9 p.m. Sunday), a darkly comic series that's easily the
most original and provoking TV since ``The Larry Sanders Show''
went kaput last spring.
</P>
<P>
   This is a post-``GoodFellas'' mob _ a suburban, cul-de-sac mob.
A mob where violence erupts as casually and unremarkable as leaf
blowing. A mob full of wiseguys who weigh offers from Hollywood to
tell their stories, and who act out scenes from their favorite mob
movies. While still a force, their heyday is past, so they filter
their experiences through Hollywood's earlier, more colorful
versions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got the Mo Green special,'' one wiseguy tells another of an
execution performed with a bullet through the victim's eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``What're you talking, Mo Green?'' the older wiseguy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `One,' '' the first wiseguy says, impatient with a peer who
doesn't pick up on his reference to the first ``Godfather'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   This is the new New Jersey-based mob that Tony Soprano runs
while dealing with his own midlife crisis. The hulking Tony is
lovably thuggish, a thinking lug's lug, a ``waste management
consultant'' who provides generously for his loyal, teeth-gritting
wife, Carmela (Edie Falco), and two teen kids, even as he roughs up
guys with a staple gun and sleeps with the help at his strip-club
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' isn't parody; it's funnier and more
self-lacerating than that. Created by David Chase (whose credits
include ``I'll Fly Away'' and ``Northern Exposure,'' and whose
Italian-American family name originally was DeCesare), ``The
Sopranos'' is literary in its nuanced handling of relationships and
motive and flux, but never highbrow. It's film, and it's good TV.
</P>
<P>
   Its cast of strutting second bananas acts as if it's not acting
at all _ except when it re-enacts scenes from mob movies: Nancy
Marchand (``Lou Grant'') as Tony's bitterly widowed mother; Michael
Imperioli (``GoodFellas'') as Tony's itchy young nephew; Jamie Lynn
Sigler and Robert Iler as Tony's pampered kids.
</P>
<P>
   By getting the details so right on something so peculiar and
particular as this, ``The Sopranos'' actually opens a clear window
onto modern incarnations of family and mortality and ambition. It's
like HBO's startling prison drama ``Oz'' in that respect, but
without the need to be so startling, because it's a lot better than
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I figured out lately?'' Tony tells his shrink
after ordering a restaurant arson. ``Talking helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony speaks for all of us. Don't miss him.

<P>
   A draft case revisited
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's ``60 Minutes'' (7 p.m. on CBS) heads to England to
interview Preston King, who fled Albany, Ga., in 1961 to avoid the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   King, 62, who is black, was denied a student deferment by
Albany's all-white draft board in the 1950s. When he refused to
appear for his physical, he was convicted of draft evasion and
sentenced to 18 months in prison. He jumped bail and fled to
England, where he earned a doctorate from the London School of
Economics. He's taught in London, Australia, Kenya and Ghana, and
is seeking to return to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   King's family, some of whom ``60 Minutes'' interviews in Albany,
contends he was a victim of racism. The Albany City Commission
recently asked President Clinton to grant him amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   King tells Morley Safer the very first thing he'll do if granted
amnesty is ``visit the graves of my mother, father and brother.''
</P>
<P>
   Turbulent 1960s
</P>
<P>
   CNN's massive ``Cold War'' enters Phase 2 of the multipart
documentary at 8 p.m. Sunday with the episode ``Make Love, Not
War.'' It looks at America in the turbulent 1960s. Among those
featured: Bobby Seale, Allen Ginsburg and Hugh Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   Future episodes involve the 1960s in Eastern Europe (Jan. 17),
China (Jan. 24), detente (Feb. 7), Africa (Feb. 14), Latin America
(Feb. 21), Solidarity (Feb. 28), the Middle East (March 7), spies
(March 14), Star Wars (March 21), the fall of the Berlin Wall
(March 28) and the post-Cold War world order (April 4).
</P>
<P>
   Honorable murder?
</P>
<P>
   Can murder ever be honorable? CNN chief international
correspondent Christiane Amanpour reports on ``honor killings'' in
some Middle Eastern countries on Sunday's ``NewsStand: CNN and
Time'' (10 p.m.). The ancient practice involves slaying a woman to
erase a dishonor she is thought to have brought on her family.
</P>
<P>
   Amanpour's report focuses on Jordan and includes the story of a
convicted honor killer who fired four bullets into his sister's
head after his family believed she had been raped. The man,
identified as Sirhan, says, ``She committed a mistake, whether
willingly or not. It is better to have one person die than to have
the whole family die of shame or disgrace.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even before Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
appeared as a berobed outsider to preside at the Senate trial of
President Clinton, there was an unscripted moment that was no less
spectacular: An informal and thoroughly anxious floor gathering of
dozens of Senators suddenly evolved, scrambling in an ad hoc grasp
at last-minute bipartisanship and common agreement in the well of
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 minutes, the debating chamber resembled a political
commodities pit, with lawmakers ringing their leaders three and
four deep to speak without floor microphones, to listen, to smile,
to point (only one in obvious anger). Gavel-free, beyond the gaze
of television lenses, the senators leaned in to partake shoulder to
shoulder in an informal tableau that seemed to personify the
open-faced worry and wonderment that this day offered the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stirring,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, as if he
had happily spied an aberrant crocus amid the wintry gray scene of
presidential impeachment. But two hours later, the senator's
exultation was dashed and seemed premature, at best; the scrum of
bipartisan give and take stood mainly as a tease of what might have
been.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans announced, but then postponed, plans to immediately
push through their own plan for a trial lasting into February,
replete with potential witnesses and freighted with Democratic
objections. Confusion suddenly reigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like the House,'' said the Senate newcomer, Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., as he darted from the high ceremonies of
impeachment to the hard politics of a Democratic caucus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hyde has rolled Lott,'' one angry Democrat alleged beyond the
debating chamber, contending Rep. Henry Hyde and the other House
Republican prosecutors of the impeachment trial were prevailing
through conservative political pressures on Sen. Trent Lott, the
Republican majority leader. ``Now the White House will have no
choice but to lawyer this thing out,'' he said, warning of a drawn
out battle.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans insisted that the Democrats were the first
to blindly close ranks in partisanship in helping the White House
fight all compromise ideas to call witnesses. Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., angrily said his party was not ``going to sit and watch all
Democrats go one way and then say the Republicans are partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators sensed the risk of their appearing to flail before the
nation in a partisan riptide. ``We want to give it another
effort,'' Tom Daschle, the Democratic minority leader, finally
announced as he appeared late in the day side by side with Lott.
They agreed to another bi-partisan attempt Friday morning to see if
a compromise trial plan can somehow be salvaged in a mass caucus of
the Senate jury.
</P>
<P>
   Lott expressed the Senate's hope for a fresh day. ``Keep calm
and cool and dignified,'' he said even as Daschle estimated the
Republicans were still unlikely to win over the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, anxiously summarized the far from
settled issue: ``The question is can we get to the point where
people can really think as jurors rather than as Republicans or
Democrats?''
</P>
<P>
   For all the tribulation beyond the chamber, Rehnquist arrived
for a swearing-in ceremony that was remarkable less for
Constitutional pomp than the near mournful hush that engulfed the
chamber. The very image of the judge occupying the Senate
president's chair was every bit as stunning to chamber habitues as
the moment when he administered the mass oath to the lawmakers as a
100-member jury.
</P>
<P>
   As Democratic leader, Daschle looked dumbfounded at what was
unfolding before him: The trial of his president and party leader
actually was coming to pass. Clinton's fate was on the line. Now
sworn as a juror, Daschle, a lawmaker who relishes the intricacies
of the usual Senate business, sat staring like a mourner at a wake.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, senators pocketed souvenir pens after firmly vowing
``impartial justice'' and signing the Senate jurors book for
history as Rehnquist opened a trial that had no clear procedures or
calendar in place.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier, no less doleful ceremony, Hyde and the 12 other
Republican trial managers were announced to the Senate chamber as
they arrived to read out the charges that Clinton ``has undermined
the integrity of his office'' and merits nothing less than
banishment from office. But even as the House visitors arrived,
Lott and Daschle and a clutch of other lawmakers were blocking the
entry aisle in another cross-party discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The senators ignored the representatives who had no choice but
to wait as the senators talked. Hyde stood patient and silent, and
his colleagues waiting mutely in line. The opening ceremony of the
impeachment trial was thus delayed a few minutes, as if in tacit
display that, for all the eagerness of the accusers from the House,
the fate of William Jefferson Clinton was now the Senate's to
settle, one way or another.

BUSH HINTS AT SCALING BACK TAX CUTS OR SPENDING PRIORITIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
and R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush said Thursday he still
wanted to slash $2.6 billion from Texans' tax bills. But he hinted
that he and the Legislature may have to scale back the tax cut or
his spending priorities in the face of budgetary restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush stopped short of backing down on the tax cut pledges he
made during his recent re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) we're all going to have to adjust our sights'' if enough
money isn't available, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush commented one day before Carole Keeton Rylander, the new
state comptroller, was scheduled to publicly release her first
revenue estimate for the legislative session that convenes Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One source, who was briefed privately Thursday, said Rylander
planned to trim $500 million to $700 million from the extra $6.3
billion in revenue that her predecessor, Democrat John Sharp, had
projected in a preliminary estimate for legislative leaders last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp's preliminary projection included a $3.7 billion surplus
at the end of this budget period Aug. 31 plus $2.6 billion in
economic growth over the next two-year budget period.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander wants $400 million of the surplus to be dedicated to
the state's rainy-day fund to be held in reserve for years of
budget shortages, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander was to publicly release her revenue projection Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller's revenue projection is crucial to the
Legislature's budget-setting process because the Texas Constitution
prohibits deficit financing.
</P>
<P>
   There also are other obstacles to Bush's priorities. One is a
constitutional cap on state spending increases, which apparently
won't be affected by Rylander's revenue estimate, and another is
projected growth in required spending on increased school
enrollment and other existing programs.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Rob Junell, chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, has said those restrictions could keep the Legislature
from spending the entire surplus. Junell, D-San Angelo, said the
spending cap plus the required extra spending will leave the
Legislature with only about $2 billion for funding new programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislative Budget Board, the Legislature's budget arm, has
adopted the spending cap, which is tied to the state's economic
growth rate, but it can be skirted by the full Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he were willing to reduce the size of the tax cut or
reduce his spending priorities, if necessary, because of the
spending cap or other budgetary restrictions, Bush replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just have to see. I'm not willing to concede yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there ought to be property tax relief, sales tax
relief and (a business) tax credit and a reform of the franchise
tax to provide significant relief for 176,000 small businesses,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a drumbeat for a tax cut. I hope so. I
campaigned on it. The people endorsed it.''
</P>
<P>
   During his re-election campaign, Bush promised to cut $2 billion
from local school property taxes, with the state making up the
difference in increased funding to school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the state reimbursement would be tied to a local
district's action in reducing property tax rates. Two years ago, at
the governor's urging, the Legislature increased a tax break for
homeowners and reimbursed school districts for lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Bush also wants to trim state sales and business
taxes by $600 million and increase state funding of public schools
by $1.6 billion _ on top of the property tax reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes some $1 billion of the extra money should go to
local school districts to use as they please on classroom
instruction, including teacher pay raises. The remainder would go
to school construction, reading programs, textbooks and programs to
end social promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is what we'll do with the money. My priority is
public education, and my second priority is a tax cut,'' the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he wanted to increase the state's share of public
education funding, which was less than half of the total when he
took office four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the state's portion of the public education budget,
he said, was the best way to reduce disparities in funding among
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``And by dedicating the lion's share of new money (to
education), we've been able to take some pressure off of property
taxes,'' he added.

 &HT;    United joins expansion at Dulles
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The skies over Washington, D.C., are getting more
crowded, and that's boosting competition in the popular
Atlanta-Washington air market.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines this week announced plans for a spring schedule
buildup at Dulles International Airport, including more flights to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier will add five new daily Atlanta-Dulles nonstops
starting May 1. It now flies the route twice daily.
</P>
<P>
   United's move follows US Airways' recent announcement its
MetroJet low-fare division will expand at Dulles and offer seven
daily Atlanta nonstops starting Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Including the nine daily Atlanta-Dulles nonstops offered by
Delta and eight by AirTran, total daily round trips on the route
will balloon from 19 now to 31 by May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect low fares and a lot of empty seats,'' said Sam
Buttrick, an analyst at PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, however, will remain the only carrier flying nonstop to
Washington's closer-in Ronald Reagan National Airport, preferred by
most business fliers though fares to Dulles are lower.

   United, which has long had a small hub at Dulles and uses the
suburban Virginia airport as an international gateway, will boost
total departures by 60 percent with added flights to cities such as
Boston, Raleigh-Durham, Orlando, Miami and New York.
</P>
<P>
   While the buildup appears mainly aimed at blunting MetroJet's
moves at Dulles, some of the new United flights also pose added
competition for Delta's Orlando, Fla.-based Delta Express division,
which flies between Florida and the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   United said it will consider putting some of its Dulles flights
under the banner of Shuttle by United, the carrier's own low-fare
division, later this year. That would add Shuttle by United, which
now flies only in the West, to the growing low-fare dogfight in the
East among MetroJet, Delta Express, AirTran and Southwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The jockeying could threaten AirTran's position at Dulles, the
only airport from which it operates nonstops to cities other than
Atlanta _ namely Boston and Chicago. ``Dulles has historically been
one of AirTran's better markets, but they could be outgunned by the
new activity,'' Buttrick said.

 &HT;    Scientific-Atlanta closes major deal
 &HT;    ATTN: Texas eds
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Scientific-Atlanta has shipped 100,000 of its new
digital set-top boxes to Time Warner _ a single order that was for
twice as many units as the company had sold before.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner plans to use Explorer 2000 boxes and the
accompanying digital system initially in Austin, Texas, where it
has about 350,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   For Atlanta-based Scientific-Atlanta, which has gambled its
future growthon the Explorer system, the sale is big _ and not only
in terms of numbers. Time Warner is the largest cable operator,
with some 12 million subscribers nationwide, and its moves are
closely followed by its peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sale shows the Explorer is bursting onto the digital
scene,'' says Steve Necessary, Scientific-Atlanta's vice president
for marketing. ``When a company like Time Warner buys this many
boxes, it's clear momentum is building for the Explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing of this sale is also important for
Scientific-Atlanta, which suffered a 54 percent drop in
international sales during its past fiscal year. The drop pummeled
the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta wouldn't release specific figures, but
Explorer boxes typically sell for between $350 and $400, depending
on the terms of a deal. That would place the value of the Time
Warner sale at about $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore the importance of the sale,
Scientific-Atlanta reported separately Thursday it expects fiscal
second-quarter results to be higher than the average Wall Street
projection. The reason is rising domestic sales, which will be
about $308 million this quarter, compared with $294.5 million in
the same period a year earlier. The company will release its
second-quarter results Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta's Explorer system enables cable operators to
offer digital television, on-screen TV guides, e-mail and
electronic commerce, among other things. These are services
subscribers pay extra to receive, typically between $20 and $40 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Time Warner plans to offer digital television. But
that's just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The network developed by Scientific-Atlanta allows a broad
range of potential applications that will enable us to offer our
customers exciting new services,'' says Jim Chiddix, Time Warner
Cable's chief technical officer.

SHAHEEN CALLS FOR MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY HOLIDAY IN N.H. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Democrat Jeanne Shaheen, the first woman to
serve as governor of New Hampshire, began her second term Thursday
by calling for the state to finally join the civil rights
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not end this century without making Martin Luther King
Day part of the heritage we leave to our children,'' Shaheen said
in her inaugural speech. New Hampshire is the only state in the
country that does not designate the third Monday in January as
Martin Luther King Day, though it does observe Civil Rights Day on
that date.
</P>
<P>
   A law establishing the King holiday _ it is now celebrated by
gubernatorial proclamation _ has passed the state Senate four times
in the past, only to die in the more conservative House.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the House defeated the measure by one vote. This year,
a bill enacting the holiday stands a better chance of passage that
at any time since the first attempt was made in 1979, said Arnie
Alpert, spokesperson for the state's Martin Luther King Day
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, virtually assuring
passage of the King Day legislation in that chamber. In the House,
Republicans maintain a 90-vote edge, but a gain of 11 seats by
Democrats in the November election has raised hopes of MLK Day
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``One third of the House turns over every two years and most of
the new folks are not on record in terms of a King vote, but we
have every reason to be optimistic,'' Alpert said. ``Certainly
having more active support from the governor's office could be the
thing that puts it over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   As she did last year, Shaheen intends to address high school
students who gather on the State House lawn on Jan. 17 to honor
King and to protest the state's lack of a holiday.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech Thursday, Shaheen had harsh words for the state's
largest utility, and although she touched upon the state's ongoing
school funding crisis, she offered no specific solutions.
</P>
<P>
   With the state facing the possible closure of many of its public
schools if the governor and legislature fail to enact a
constitutional method for funding education by April 1, Shaheen's
second inauguration lacked the celebratory air that launched her
first term.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, however, Democrats captured the state senate for the
first time since 1912 and Thursday Shaheen's inaugural subtly paid
tribute to one of her party's grand eras. Musicians played in the
State House hallways, and 38 years after Robert Frost was called
upon to recite a poem at President Kennedy's inaguration, Frost's
granddaughter, Lesley Lee Francis, read Frost's poem ``The Tuft of
Flowers'' as Shaheen looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen's 26-minute speech kicked off what she admitted will be
an unusually difficult and historic year. ``You wonder why we had
all those prayers? We're going to need them,'' Shaheen said before
discussing school finance reform, the issue that has dominated all
others in New Hampshire for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge is to change the way we fund public education
without losing what is special about our schools and our
state...Businesses do choose to locate here because taxes are low
and government is small, and we must keep it that way,'' she said
of a state that lacks both a general sales or income tax.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen would like to see the Legislature adopt two
constitutional methods for funding education in the coming months.
She said both plans would then be placed before voters who would be
asked to choose one method of taxing themselves over another. That
vote would most likely take place at town meetings held around the
state in March, a plan her opponents call an abdication of
representative government in a state with 424 legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot use a referendum as an excuse not to make the tough
decisions, not to do our job,'' House Speaker Donna Sytek said in
response to Shaheen's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen saved her only angry words for Public Service Co. of New
Hampshire, the state's largest utility and one whose customers pay
rates that are among the highest in the nation. The state and the
utility, which is owned by Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities,
have been at odds and in court over a plan to bring competition to
the electric utility industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not enter into an agreement with PSNH that gives all
the burdens to ratepayers and all the benefits to shareholders,''
Shaheen warned of the coming year's negotiations. ``The world has
changed, and new technologies are becoming available. If PSNH
refuses to adapt, it will be left behind.''

 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After the extraordinary rancor and the party-line
impeachment vote in the House, many senators, priding themselves on
serving in a more deliberative, more temperate chamber, predicted
that they would have an easy standard to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House has taken a shellacking because of the party-line
votes and the obvious partisanship,'' Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
said at the time. ``People expect the Senate to handle it
judiciously and without partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   But the people may be disappointed. Throughout the day, the raw
partisanship that wracked the House seemed to be infecting the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In the most blatant example, Republicans accused Democrats of
boycotting a rare, private joint session of the Senate called by
the Republican leaders to hash over rules for a trial. Earlier in
the day, Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader, brimming with good
cheer, said he would convene the session ``to decide in a
bipartisan fashion how to proceed.'' Several Democrats insisted
that they were never invited.
</P>
<P>
   And it was clear that Republican opposition had sunk one plan,
that even Lott had embraced gingerly, for a truncated trial and for
wrapping up impeachment within a week.
</P>
<P>
   A major difference in the House and the Senate is that senators
seemed far more protective of their reputation for being above
partisanship. After the plan for the joint meeting collapsed, Lott
announced that Republicans would call a vote on their plans for a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   But he later put off the vote, and several Republican senators
said they did not want to appear as partisan as their House
counterparts. ``We really didn't want to look like that,'' said
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   A popular explanation for the accelerated partisanship in
Congress is that politicians in both parties often find themselves
torn between a broader constituency and the outside wing of their
party, people who serve as the shock troops in every election and,
if disaffected, could threaten to challenge them in primaries.
</P>
<P>
   But that is only a partial rationale. The tensions in the Senate
are being driven by a complicated set of pressures and
calculations, only some of which are blatantly political. While
Democrats seem relatively unified, Republicans are split: Some
senators may be responding directly to their base conservative
voters who do not want Clinton to get off the hook no matter what.
Yet others like Lott have proposed more pragmatic compromises out
of concern that a prolonged trial could tarnish the party in the
next election.
</P>
<P>
   Still other senators may be moved by a sense that they should
not abandon their House colleagues who voted for impeachment. And
others may not be thinking about politics at all, but about
imperatives they discern in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Specter, who had hoped for an early resolution, is
pressing, aggressively, for a full trial. Republicans might have
looked to him to help broker a consensus. But instead, Specter has
offered himself as a guardian of the framers' intent.
</P>
<P>
   A telling sign that the Senate might not escape the partisan
turbulence came two days before the impeachment vote last month
when Lott declared that he could not support the bombing of Iraq
because he had questions about the president's motivations.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, partisanship has been most blatant in the House,
where members are increasingly beholden to their parties' most
fervent core. Increasingly, state legislatures draw congressional
districts that are designed to protect seats for each party,
diminishing the moderating influence of swing districts where both
parties were forced to compete for the middle. Fund raising also
pushes candidates to their parties' most loyal _ and generous _
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   For years, academics have complained that politicians follow
polls too closely. But in fact the Republican majority of the House
could vote in defiance of the national polls, and take a stand
approved only by conservative Republicans, not because of courage,
but because their districts have been drawn to ensure their
re-election, with diminished turnout that leaves the diehards of
either side the only dependable voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's advantage is that most of its members have to think
about voters of both parties. They have much broader constituencies
than the increasingly narrow-based House districts that send
ideologues to Washington. And senators do not face the same
immediate pressures because they only have to answer to the
electorate every six years.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former lawmakers lament that partisanship is so deep
that it is no longer common for members to reach across the aisle
and build friendships, let alone have conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had major debates but we were able still to relate to each
other,'' said former Rep. Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, who was the
fourth-ranking Republican leader in the House until 1992 and is now
a professor at Harvard. ``We were able to be friends across the
aisle. Now it's become a matter of each side trying to destroy the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the House voted to impeach Clinton, Jimmy Hayes, a former
Republican congressman from Louisiana, said he had planned to use
his privilege as a former member to watch the historic
deliberations from the floor of the chamber. But partisan passions
had grown so venomous that he changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very strained atmosphere so that even saying hello
to people is misread as a partisan act,'' Hayes said. ``Instead, I
decided to just watch it on television.''
</P>
<P>
   In a day when partisan fevers rose and fell, Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass., said he could offer one example of genuine bipartisanship:
``We swore everybody in. That was pretty bipartisan!''

 &HT;    Discount retailers benefit most from holiday cheer
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Retailers escaped post-holiday blues as the mercurial
Christmas season shook out better-than-expected sales gains.
</P>
<P>
   Discounters such as Wal-Mart and Target, along with retailers
like the Gap, got the biggest boosts because shoppers preferred
perennial bargains and specialty brand names over widespread
promotions by department stores.
</P>
<P>
   December sales at stores open at least a year rose 5.6 percent
over the year-ago period, according to the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
Ltd., which forecasted a gain of as much as 4.75 percent. The bank
tracks results from 85 retailers. In 1997, sales for December rose
4.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Warm weather across the nation got the 1998 holiday season off
to a sluggish start, and analysts tempered their forecasts as sales
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   But a cold snap late in December spurred sales of outerwear and
winter household goods. Wal-Mart's same-store sales rose 9.4
percent, Target's jumped 7 percent and Kmart increased sales by 4.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some specialty apparel retailers enjoyed double-digit increases.
Gap sales rose 19 percent, and AnnTaylor Stores increased sales
15.9 percent. American Eagle Outfitters said sales were up 20.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of the month gave most retailers a second life,'' said
analyst Mark Picard of Lazard Freres &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Deep markdowns at department stores on coats and other winter
clothing pushed Federated Department Stores Inc. sales up 5.7
percent, although it's unclear how the promotions will affect
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Saks Inc. said sales in its department store division that
includes newly acquired Parisian increased 2 percent. Sales in the
Saks Fifth Avenue division rose 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But holiday sales slid 7.6 percent at J.C. Penney stores as
consumers took advantage of markdowns on brand name clothing at
specialty chains and higher-end department stores. And Sears said
December sales decreased 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us, the world's biggest toy retailer, also suffered.
Fewer hit toys and competition from Wal-Mart and Kmart contributed
to a 7 percent drop in December sales.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales are propping the strength of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Before December sales results came out, analysts expected growth
in the gross domestic product of 3.5 percent to 4 percent for 1998.
Now, many are revising their estimates to 4 percent or higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good Christmas is often a precursor to a good year in the
economy,'' said Michael Niemira, an analyst at Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi. ``It may bode very well for 1999.''

CHIEF JUSTICE OPENS PRESIDENTIAL IMPEACHMENT TRIAL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a hushed chamber under heavy security, Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist on Thursday opened the first
presidential impeachment trial in 131 years, swearing in senators
to ``do impartial justice'' in judging whether President William
Jefferson Clinton should be removed from office for perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of the nation's 42nd president formally began as
senators struggled through another day, searching for a way around
the impasse between the two parties over whether to call witnesses.
The mood swung wildly throughout the day. Bipartisan bonhomie in
the morning gave way to recriminations that left the parties at the
brink of a showdown vote over competing trial plans in the late
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But desperately trying to stave off the rancorous partisanship
of the House, the two parties pulled back from the confrontation
and planned an unusual joint caucus of all 100 senators in the
Capitol's rarely used ceremonial Old Senate Chamber on Friday. Sen.
Trent Lott, the majority leader, and Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority
leader, appeared together on Thursday night to announce the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the best way to keep cool and calm and dignified is
to hear each other and talk to each other,'' Lott said. ``Now does
that solve all the problems? No.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press secretary,
said the president's lawyers would ``make a compelling case that
will lead the United States Senate not to remove the president.''
He said Clinton was willing to agree to accept many of the facts in
the case set out by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, in
order to avoid the need for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But he warned sharply that the introduction of witnesses would
draw out the trial, ``because bringing witnesses in and not
stipulating to a record opens up a whole area of motions, discovery
and depositions. And that takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment trial of Clinton officially began just before 10
a.m., when a procession of 13 House Republicans who will act as
prosecutors at the trial paraded past the marble statuary on the
second floor of the Capitol and into the Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye!'' the Senate sergeant-at-arms,
James W. Ziglar, called out to the 100 senators and spectators in
the visitors' galleries. ``All persons are commanded to keep silent
on pain of imprisonment.'' It was a proclamation used in the trial
of Andrew Johnson _ the only other president to be judged by the
Senate _ in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, the chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee and leader of the House impeachment team, then
stood at a wooden lectern in the well of the chamber. The other
House Republicans lined up nearby. As the senators sat quietly,
Hyde read the two articles of impeachment that were approved by the
House in December. He accused Clinton of having ``willfully
corrupted and manipulated the judicial process of the United States
for his personal gain and exoneration.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the House members left and an extraordinary scene ensued,
as about 40 senators of both parties clustered around Lott and
Daschle on the Senate floor, talking, gesticulating, laughing and
negotiating, still trying to work out the rules for the trial. But
several senators later said that misunderstandings _ or
miscalculations _ that emerged from the discussion set the seeds
for a confrontation that almost put the Senate on a partisan course
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Senate chamber, the Capitol was under extraordinary
security. Capitol police lined the corridors and barred reporters
and visitors from much of the second floor. Black duffel bags
containing gas masks were placed at various entrances to the Senate
chamber to be used by police officers and lawmakers in the case of
a terrorist attack. ``As you know, chemical threats are prevalent
in today's world,'' said Officer Vito Raymond of the U.S. Capitol
Police. ``Preventive steps were taken by the U.S. Capitol Police.''

A NEW PROGNOSTIC TOOL FOR HEART ATTACK RISK  
 A CAESAREAN EFFORT DRAWS SPECIALISTS' IRE  
 OTHER DEVELOPMENTS, HIV TO BETA-CAROTENE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   &UR; A new prognostic tool for heart attack risk
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ultrasound measurements of neck artery thickness are
considerably better than blood pressure or cholesterol readings in
predicting heart attacks or strokes among older people according to
a study being reported this week.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel H. O'Leary, the New England Medical Center's chief
radiologist, and several colleagues followed 4,476 men and women
older than 65 with no symptoms of cardiovascular disease. They were
participating in a federally funded health study. They used
ultrasound to measure how much fat and cholesterol had built up on
the walls of key zones of their carotid arteries, then followed
people for an average of more than six years.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, artery wall thickness proved to be a strong predictor
of who would have a stroke or heart attack. The 20 percent of
people with the thickest vein walls had on average about 5.5 times
as many strokes or heart attacks as the bottom 20 percent of study
participants, O'Leary's team wrote for the current New England
Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Among people with high blood pressure and cholesterol, those
with the thickest artery walls had about twice the risk of heart
attack or stroke as those with the thinnest. ``Carotid ultrasound
is a stronger predictor than anything else'' of risk, O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claude Lenfant, head of the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute, said in a statement that the method ``has great
potential'' for preventing the first- and third-ranking of death in
the United States. About 650,000 people a year die of heart attack
or stroke here.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary cautioned that doctors and technicians will first need
much training in how to interpret the ultrasound images. ``We
shouldn't encourage everyone to run to the doctor to have their
wall thickness tested,'' O'Leary said, but expects it will in time
become ``a very powerful test'' that can be done easily and fairly
cheaply in doctor's offices.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; A Caesarean effort draws specialists' ire
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four prominent Boston obstetricians are blasting federal efforts
to sharply cut the rate of Caesarean deliveries within the next two
years, calling it an ``authoritarian'' effort that could threaten
women's and babies' health.
</P>
<P>
   Caesarean delivery rates have soared in the last three decades,
from 5 percent in 1970 to a peak of 25 percent in 1988, and now at
about 21 percent. The US Department of Health and Human Services
has set a goal of reducing the rate to 15 percent by 2000, both to
save money and reduce health risks for women who could safely
deliver vaginally.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``there is no evidence to support this target'' of 15
percent, said the chiefs of obstetrics at Massachusetts General
Hospital, Dr. Fredric Frigoletto, and at Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center, Benjamin Sachs. Co-authors of the paper are Dr.
Mary Ames Castro of Mass. General and and Dr. Cindy Kobelin of Beth
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reducing the rate of Caesarean section delivery may lead to
higher costs and more complications for mothers and their babies,''
the four doctors write. Alternatives to C-section, such as vacuum
and forceps extraction of infants, have considerable risks, and
attempting vaginal delivery after having had a C-section leads to
uterine rupture in about 1 of 100 women.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Other developments, HIV to beta-carotene
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other medical news: California AIDS researchers report in the
current Nature Medicine that HIV not only kills off T-cells in the
body's immune system, but apparently also stops the body's ability
to make more. . . . A urine-sample test called NMP22 produced by a
Newton, Mass. company, Matritech, may be used as an inexpensive,
pain-free way to screen undiagnosed people for bladder cancer,
according to a Journal of Urology study . . . Coating the inside as
well as the outside of central-vein catheters with two special
drugs, as is now commonly done, may reduce bloodstream infections
that strike 150,000 US patients annually, Baylor College of
Medicine researchers report in the New England Journal . . .
Studies of ferrets by Tufts Medical School researchers may explain
why high-dose beta carotene supplements (but not beta carotene from
real food, like carrots and yams) had raised lung cancer rates of
smokers in two studies. Dr. Xiang-Dong Wang and colleagues write in
the Journal of the National Cancer Institute that excess beta
carotene settling in the furry mammals' lungs became oxidized into
products that disrupt cell division in a way that can lead to
cancer.

 &HT;    Support for high-tech group shows Georgia's ability to think
outside the box
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Yamacraw Mission is the outgrowth of numerous
efforts to bolster Georgia's high-tech industry that have been
fermenting for the past decade. And it culminates an era of
strategic links that have been built through the Georgia Research
Alliance between the state's research universities, government and
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, the Yamacraw project is one of the first tangible
examples of a smooth transition between Gov.-elect Roy Barnes and
Gov. Zell Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Under Miller's leadership, Georgia has invested about $200
million over eight years in the Georgia Research Alliance. The
investment has enabled Georgia universities to attract top
international scholars in targeted areas of technology. But more
important than the dollars are the relationships that are being
formed between universities, industry and government.
</P>
<P>
   Without missing a step, Barnes on Thursday announced his request
to the General Assembly to allocate $13.6 million toward the
Yamacraw Mission. That is in addition to the $42.7 million he
already has included in his budget for the GRA this year. Clearly,
Barnes is willing to aggressively support the technology initiative
that was started under Miller. ``This shows the smoothness of
transition from one governor to the next,'' said William J. Todd,
president of the GRA.
</P>
<P>
   The Yamacraw team was chaired by Randy Cardoza, commissioner of
the Georgia Department of Industry, Trade and Tourism. As he sees
it, the Yamacraw project will cultivate three complementary efforts
_ research, education and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The research technology piece will be headed by J. Michael
Cummins, who is director of the Georgia Center for Advanced
Telecommunications Technology (a division of GRA) and will also be
director of the Yamacraw Electronic Design Center.
</P>
<P>
   He'll work closely with two Georgia experts in semiconductor
research: James D. Meindl, director of the Microelectronics
Research Center, and Rao R. Tummala, a GRA eminent scholar in
multichip packaging.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech and its president, Wayne Clough, will form the
nucleus of the effort. The research center affiliated with the
Yamacraw project will initially be located adjacent to the Tech
campus in the GCATT building and will draw upon much of the
foundation already in place in the university.
</P>
<P>
   But other universities won't be left out. GRA requires that all
the projects it funds be a partnership of at least two research
universities, and as a result, relationships among them continue to
grow stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The Yamacraw Mission, however, stretches far beyond the six GRA
universities to eight institutions around the state. Strategically,
spreading the educational dollars to eight institutions around the
state also enhances the political chances that the initiative will
be approved by the General Assembly. It also will help link the
research being done by GRA's eminent scholars to companies around
the state.
</P>
<P>
   And that leads to the economic development and marketing piece
of the project.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to lure companies and high-paying jobs to Georgia.
When all is said and done, the Yamacraw Mission will be deemed
successful only if it leads to industries investing millions of
dollars in the state, particularly by building semiconductor plants
that could employ thousands of people. A semiconductor plant
requires an investment of between $1 billion and $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communications and communications network are at the core of
the dynamic growth cycle that's going on in this country,'' said F.
Duane Ackerman, CEO of BellSouth Corp. ``And the core of all of
that is the chip. It's exciting and could be the economic
development of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, James S. Blanchard, CEO of Synovus Financial
Corp. and GRA's chairman, told a state economic developers group
how important such a plant would be to Georgia's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next 10 years, there will be 100 semiconductor plants
built in the world,'' Blanchard said at the time. ``If we get one,
we will get four or five. But we have got to think outside the box.
Business as usual won't get a plant to Georgia. If we sit on our
laurels, all 100 will be built elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yamacraw Mission is Georgia's attempt to think outside the
box. Time will prove whether they were right

AT THE WHITE HOUSE, A FACADE OF NORMALCY 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ All was made to appear normal at the White House
Thursday on another historically abnormal day in the presidency of
Bill Clinton. Clinton met with his national security adviser on a
military incident in Iraq, shared his customary Thursday lunch with
Vice President Al Gore and presided over an East Room ceremony at
which he announced an expansion of after-school programs for
children of working parents.
</P>
<P>
   At the education event, Clinton made no reference to the opening
of his impeachment trial in the Senate two hours earlier. But first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton pointedly noted that the White House
education announcement _ unlike the grim proceedings in the Senate
chamber _ concerned ``what is really important and what our
priorities must be as we move into the 21st century together.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House aide said that Thursday would be like every
other day for the foreseeable future as the president tries to
conduct the business of the country while his lawyers prepare for
his impeachment trial and his political future is weighed by his
Senate jury. The skillful White House image apparatus is taking
pains to make the extraordinary _ the governance of the first
impeached president in 131 years _ appear utterly ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are fated to a split-screen government, all we can
control is what occurs on our side of the screen,'' said Paul
Begala, senior adviser to the president. ``On our side will be a
president confident and competent and commanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, therefore, is to fashion an event or announcement
almost every day to control the images projected from the White
House. In the past week, Clinton has appeared in public to announce
new federal subsidies for long-term care of the elderly, a new drug
testing and treatment program for prison inmates, a record federal
budget surplus, and Thursday's proposal to triple government
spending for after-school and summer-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   Behind closed doors, the president and his senior advisers are
working on the State of the Union address, which Clinton plans to
give as scheduled on Jan. 19. He hopes to deliver the prime-time
speech to a joint session of Congress with all its attendant
ceremony, even if it is bracketed by days of impeachment trial
deliberations, to show that he is fully engaged in the people's
work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his aides are also devising a legal strategy to
defend the president in whatever form the Senate impeachment trial
takes. Aides warned Thursday that an open-ended trial with
witnesses could last for months and tie the Congress in knots.
</P>
<P>
   The White House impeachment-management team, like previous
damage-control squads that dealt with crises from Whitewater to the
revelation of the Monica Lewinsky affair, is generally walled off
from the day-to-day activities of the president and the rest of the
staff, officials said. Members of the team intrude on Clinton's
time only when they need to consult him on a point of law or
political strategy, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Begala said that 5 percent of the White House staff handles
impeachment matters; the rest carry out the normal functions of the
executive branch, from personnel to budget matters to foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that what is happening on the Hill is a
distraction, there's no doubt it's important and there's no doubt
we don't control it,'' Begala said. ``We're not going to provide
running commentary on it. But we are determined to show what is the
reality and which is the distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton refused to be distracted by the solemn reading of the
articles of impeachment Thursday morning on the Senate floor by
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who will serve as chief prosecutor of the
president. Clinton was in the White House residence handling
paperwork and receiving a briefing from Sandy Berger, the national
security adviser, on an incident in northern Iraq Thursday
involving an American F-16 and an Iraqi ground-to-air missile
battery.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also did not bother to watch the installation of Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist as the presiding officer of the
impeachment trial and the swearing in of the 100 senators as
jurors.

<P>
   At that hour, Clinton and Gore were having lunch in the
president's private dining room off the Oval Office. Gore chose not
to exercise his constitutional right to preside over the opening of
the Senate trial of the president Thursday, leaving the chair to
96-year-old Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Gore declined to explain Gore's decision not to
attend the Senate ceremony. ``He just didn't,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is responding to his own need to stay busy at an
agonizing time of his life, as well as to polls that show a large
majority of the public fed up with the Lewinsky-impeachment drama,
advisers say.
</P>
<P>
   He is not indifferent to his fate, they say; he is simply
determined to deal with those things that he can do something
about.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said Clinton was
leaving his impeachment defense primarily in the hands of the
lawyers and political advisers he hired to manage it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to create the impression that he is
uninvolved,'' Lockhart said. ``But a good client allows his lawyers
to do their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the White House, work goes on with an air of
resigned unreality and all the appearance of normality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sticking to our work has been our strength, our saving
grace,'' said a senior White House official who insisted on
anonymity. ``If we allow this stuff to take over everybody's job,
we've lost anyway.''

LOTT AT CENTER OF PRECARIOUS PROCEDURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Making one of the most historic statements of his
career, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott launched the impeachment
trial of President Clinton Thursday with an announcement that the
Senate would ``now administer the off, oaf ... oath.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lott, it has been that kind of week.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that kind of a process, in fact _ a precarious
course with an array of unexpected stumbling blocks for the
Republican leader, who is struggling to balance demands from
conservatives for a thorough trial against both Democratic
opposition and unfavorable public opinion polls. His future hangs
on how the ordeal unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   He has already seen two Republican colleagues destroyed in the
impeachment tornado _ former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former
speaker-designate Robert L. Livingston, who both resigned during
last month's proceedings in the House. But for Lott, a conservative
from Mississippi who in recent years has outraged both ends of the
policial spectrum on unrelated matters, the challenge of an
impeachment compromise may be more perilous, according to other
senators and Senate aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in an almost impossible situaton,'' said Senator Judd
Gregg, a Republican from New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a quandary Lott enjoys. According to those who know
him, Lott, 57, is a meticulous man of order, a former college
cheerleader who sometimes laughs gregariously at jokes, but when
faced with chaos furrows his brow with intensity, determined to
straighten things out.
</P>
<P>
   His taste for order does not translate into a passion for
bipartisanship. Although he was raised a Democrat, the son of a
shipyard worker and a school teacher, Lott switched to the
Republican Party when he ran for Congress in 1972. He became an
anchor of the conservative core in the 17 years that followed,
supporting President Nixon while a member of the House Judiciary
Committee during Watergate and attacking Clinton as recently as
last month. Immediately after Clinton announced air raids on Iraq,
Lott suggested the move was an attempt to distract attention from
impeachment proceedings, saying ``both the timing and the policy
are subject to question.''
</P>
<P>
   But as majority leader, Lott has cultivated friends on both
sides of the aisle and has appeared so conciliatory at times that
the most conservative Republicans in the Senate have attacked him
for conceding too much to Democrats, especially on such issues as
the budget and a chemical weapons treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the impeachment trial moves forward, this same group of
as many as 20 Republicans appear to be pulling Lott back toward his
conservative roots. By refusing to accept censure _ and refusing to
eliminate the possibility to hear witnesses, including former White
House intern Monica S. Lewinsky, during a trial _ they have trapped
Lott in a tricky passageway between compromise and deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   They have also forced Lott to ignore the polls. According to a
new New York Times/CBS opinion poll, Republicans are at a 20-year
low in the public's view, with only 38 percent of the respondents
saying they have a favorable opinion of the GOP. Last year, 46
percent said they felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest threat to Lott's efforts at compromise comes from
his own side, from those seemingly determined to run the GOP off a
cliff,'' James Pinkerton, a Republican who served in the White
House under President Bush and now teaches at George Washington
University, wrote in an editorial in the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Lott seemed irritated by the dilemma _ and by the
criticism that has accompanied it. Returning earlier this week from
Mississippi, where he did not comment on impeachment, Lott
countered complaints that he had been hiding from the difficult
maneuveuring the situation required.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no moss growing under my feet,'' he said. ``Never before
have I had so much reported about what I was thinking, doing or
saying when I said so little. I've been accused of being holed up
in my hometown of Pascagoula, Mississippi. Where would you expect
me to be during the holidays?''
</P>
<P>
   Among Lott's most consistent supporters in recent weeks have
been moderate New England Republicans _ Senators Olympia Snowe and
Susan Collins of Maine, James M. Jeffords of Vermont and John H.
Chafee of Rhode Island, who met with Lott to discuss a plan to
expedite impeachment proceedings on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   And several Democrats sounded sympathetic to Lott. Although
Senator Bob Kerrey, a Democrat from Nebraska, attacked the GOP for
refusing to accept a plan that would speed up the trial process, he
refused to attack Lott himself. And Senator Carl Levin, a Democrat
from Michigan, gave him outright support.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing the best he can under a difficult situation,''
Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Lott presented a united front with the Senate
Democratic leader, Thomas A. Daschle, holding a news conference to
announce a relative victory under the circumstances: a bipartisan
conference of all 100 senators had been scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement came after a day of pomp and spectacle, in
which a similar bipartisan meeting was scheduled, then canceled,
then argued over by dozens of senators as they scurried through the
halls of the Capitol throughout the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   And even as Lott and Daschle said they want to reach an
agreement on how to proceed _ with Lott saying phrases like
``understanding one another'' and creating a ``better feeling''
among senators _ it was clear the future of impeachment, and Lott,
was far from settled. And, aides said, Lott knew it.
</P>
<P>
   As a spokesman for Snowe said: ``His entire career will be
judged by the manner in which he handles this.''

 &HT;    Cox, 11 broadcasters invest in USA Digital technology
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cox Radio has joined with other major radio
broadcasters to invest in a company developing a technology that
will send CD quality sound to listeners' radios.
</P>
<P>
   The company is USA Digital Radio and it's developing a
technology called Digital Audio Broadcasting. This technology also
will simultaneously send both current signals and digital ones.
That means listeners wouldn't lose channel reception during the
industry transition to digital radios.
</P>
<P>
   USA Digital has been seeking broad industry support to establish
its technology as the standard for the next generation of radios
and radio signals. Cox Radio, based in Atlanta, is one of 12 big
radio broadcasters that announced Thursday they would buy a stake
in USA Digital as a sign of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``This support by the nation's largest radio broadcasters
reiterates the strong industry commitment to a digital future,''
says Robert Struble, USA Digital's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The support is important because there's a contest under way for
which technology will become the standard. Others offering
competing technology include Lucent, which is emphasizing
compression and data transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission is expected to pick one of
these technologies as the standard for digital radio sometime
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Digital radio offers more than just music and talk. It can also
transmit data, such as stock quotes, and e-mail to the next
generation of radios on the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   Other broadcasters investing in USA Digital are Chancellor
Media, Clear Channel, Emmis, Gannett and CBS Radio. CBS Radio and
former parent Westinghouse Electric and Gannett were the original
investors in the technology.

ANNAN SEEKS TO MAKE AMENDS WITH WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Smarting from US charges that he is undermining
American policy in Iraq, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan is seeking
to repair his relations with Washington, senior UN officals said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Annan still is hoping to break the impasse
over Iraq in the 15-nation UN Security Council and fashion a united
policy toward Baghdad, UN officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They added that Annan in coming days will appeal to the US
administration to step back from its military confrontation with
Iraq, speaking to US officials in private and making a speech to
the New York-based Council of Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   But an administration official, still fuming over leaked,
UN-based disclosures of US spying in Iraq, warned that Annan and
other council members had better stop siding with Iraq in Baghdad's
effort to shed economic sanctions without meeting its obligation to
disarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is clearly a lot of work to be done,'' the US official
said on condition of anonymity. ``A good start is conducting this
in private.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington also disclosed the latest brush with an Iraqi
anti-aircraft battery and portrayed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
as growing more desperate, citing reports of executions.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, meanwhile, sought to parley the disclosure of Washington's
spying on Iraq into a public relations bonanza for the regime. It
called on the United Nations to drive all American and British UN
employees out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Annan Thursday, Iraq also demanded that
non-profit organizations serving the United Nations in northern
Iraq get out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   They are ``spies and saboteurs,'' Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed Sahaf wrote in a letter to Annan. ``Iraq demands an
immediate suspension of dealings undertaken by the UN on this
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council has been paralyzed since the United States
and Britain bombed Iraq for four days last month, marking the end
of Washington's efforts to use diplomacy to force Baghdad to give
up its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   France, Russia and China failed to persuade Washington to soften
its position, and have yet to introduce any new initiatives to
forge a consensus for a diplomatic settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, too, has sought for several days to craft a
response to reports in the Boston Globe and Washington Post that
Americans serving the UN weapons inspections team were proxy spies
for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to handle the arms inspection job on its own, the UN
Special Commission on Iraq requested help from dozens of countries,
including the United States. US experts in chemical, biological and
nuclear weapons were attached to UNSCOM on temporary assignment,
White House and State Department officials said. The information
they collected was controlled entirely by the United Nations, US
officials maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business of weapons of mass destruction arms control is
extremely serious and cannot be carried out by amateurs,'' said
State Department deputy spokesman James Foley. ``The United States
has sent UNSCOM our best weapons' experts, both from the government
and private organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   But once these officials returned to their US agencies, they
carried with them valuable information that vastly improved the US
intelligence picture of Iraq, information useful to US military
planners, among others. Some of the experts sent to UNSCOM came
from US intelligence agencies, a US official told The Associated
Press on condition of anonymity. The identity of the agencies
sending US officials to work with the United Nations was not
disclosed to the Iraqis, making officials, in effect, undercover
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Concern at the United Nations that ostensibly international
inspections benefited US intelligence threatens to undermine the
basis for administration policy on Iraq. More than a year of
tension between Washington and Baghdad began in the fall of 1997
when Iraq demanded an end to US participation in the weapons
inspections, charging that they were espionage operations.
</P>
<P>
   Simmering tensions in Iraq flared up again Thursday when a US
Air Force F16 fighter jet opened fire on an anti-radar installation
in Northern Iraq. Pentagon officials said the American pilot
launched a high-speed anti-radar missile after it was targeted
during a patrol of the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
   Major General Anthony Zinni, leader of the US Central Command
said that the episode was the latest sign that President Husein is
losing control. Zinni said a wave of executions of military leaders
and civilians and the growing public quarrel with key Arab nations,
primarily Saudi Arabia and Egypt indicated Hussein is losing his
grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a member of Sadaam Hussein's inner circle, I'd
worry. I do think we see clear signs that his inner control has
been affected.'' he said. ``I think we see clear signs that they
(Iraqi leadership) are desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, chief UN weapons inspector Richard Butler _ a
focus of friction between Annan and Washington _ hinted that he
might step down.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published Thursday in the Sydney Morning Herald,
the Australian weapons inspector said, ``I have always said I don't
want to stay in this job forever. I don't think this is the sort of
job that one would want to do _ or put one's family through _ for a
very long time.''

HISTORIC IMPACT OF TRIAL'S OPENING IS REDUCED ON TV SCREEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Conditioned by the Diana years, television viewers have come to
expect ceremony to mean regal extravagance, a fairy-tale wedding in
St. Paul's Cathedral or a funeral in Westminster Abbey. But the
American ceremony on view Thursday looked like men and women in
business suits (mostly white men in dark suits), standing in line,
signing a book and keeping a souvenir pen.
</P>
<P>
   The formal opening of the Senate trial of Bill Clinton was a
matter of gravity and dignity, but not a matter of pomp. Yet all
the television networks were there, and, as if to justify their
presence, they offered their version of the little boy who cried
wolf: the little commentators who cried ``History!'' and expected a
startled response.
</P>
<P>
   At every crucial turn in the impeachment process, the analysts
have proclaimed that this time _ the start of the House Judiciary
Committee hearings, the House impeachment vote, the start of the
trial _ it truly was historic.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday it seemed the commentators were failing to look at
the pictures their networks were sending out, as they ignored the
gulf between the day's huge historical import and its minimal
emotional impact. Following rules that predate television by nearly
a century, the formal ceremony collided with the reality of the
media age, which reduces everyone (true royals excepted) to equal,
small-screen size.
</P>
<P>
   Though the drumbeat of ``History!'' continued (''We are here
today to see something that no American has ever seen before,''
Peter Jennings said as he began ABC's coverage), there was a new
undercurrent; commentators acknowledged they were echoing
themselves. In his folksy tone, Dan Rather offered a pre-emptive
explanation, saying on CBS, ``You say, well, come on, Dan, you keep
saying it's historic. There's no other word that describes it.''
</P>
<P>
   Overstating the emotional temperature was easy, given the quaint
historical touches that helped shape the day, such as the sergeant
at arms' proclamation that senators were ``commanded to keep
silence on pain of imprisonment'' during the reading of the
articles of impeachment by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   But both Hyde and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, when he
swore in the senators as jurors in the afternoon, refused to
enhance the drama; deliberately, they did not play to the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's reading was uninflected; he kept his eyes down as he read
from papers on a lectern. It was impossible to know whether he was
determined to get it right, dying to get it over with, or both.
Later, reporters convincingly explained his demeanor. Bob Franken
on CNN said Hyde described himself as ``depressed and jittery,''
and Chip Reid on MSNBC reported that Hyde said he was ``moved by
the solemnity'' of the act and ``saddened'' at having to do it. Yet
there was also a practical reason for the aura of detachment:
because Hyde was not reading from a teleprompter, he was not
providing that illusion of eye contact viewers have become so
accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   That odd act of reading from papers on camera shaped the
impression of the afternoon session as well. When Rehnquist was
sworn in by Senate president pro tem Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the
senator was hunched forward reading the oath and Rehnquist looked
as if he were holding his hand over the Thurmond's head. It was an
eccentric image that made them look disconcertingly like a
vaudeville team.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the democratic style, the day offered reminders that one
of the oldest themes in American culture is the secret longing for
an aristocracy. Reporters devoted a ludicrous amount of filler time
to the four gold stripes Rehnquist had fixed to his robes, a touch
borrowed from a character in the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta
``Iolanthe.'' The affectation was unanimously characterized as as
endearingly fanciful.
</P>
<P>
   Rather signed off in the afternoon with a mini-essay on rituals,
saying they ``derive much of their power from repetition.''
Apparently there was more repetition than CBS and NBC were willing
to sit still for. Both went back to regular programs while the
senators were still signing their names in the oath book. Of the
broadcast networks, only ABC stayed on until the Senate recessed
(all of 10 or 15 minutes later).
</P>
<P>
   Among all this talk, Bob Schieffer of CBS seemed most astute
when he said from Capitol Hill, ``I'm not sure many people here
sense the historic moment of what has just transpired.'' Instead,
he said, they seemed ``caught in some inexorable force,'' not
knowing where it will go. What he captured was that discordance
between the emotional impact and events that were undoubtedly
historical. In the fable, after all, the wolf finally does turn up.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Monica Lewinsky is summoned to testify at
President Clinton's Senate trial, she will have no choice but to
answer all questions completely and truthfully. That was a
condition of the immunity agreement that Ms. Lewinsky signed with
the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, last July.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ms. Lewinsky, the former White House intern, had a
choice, she would rather not be forced to become the trial's star
witness and endure additional questions under oath about her
relationship with the president, several associates said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of how difficult it was for her to testify about such
private matters before the grand jury behind closed doors,'' said
an associate, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``But having to
answer personal questions on the Senate floor? That would be very
difficult for her. No one wants that.''
</P>
<P>
   After being granted complete immunity from prosecution by the
office of independent counsel, Ms. Lewinsky promised to cooperate
with the ongoing inquiry and to testify truthfully in any forum.
</P>
<P>
   Her appearance in a Senate trial would not be without risks. If
Starr's prosecutors believed that she lied under questioning by the
House managers, they could choose to revoke the immunity agreement
and file perjury charges against her.
</P>
<P>
   One associate said Thursday that Ms. Lewinsky had spent
virtually no time preparing herself for any further testimony. Late
last year she assumed, correctly, that the House Judiciary
Committee would not call her to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky has tried to maintain a low profile in recent
months. Late last year she moved into a rented apartment in the Los
Angeles area, and she has spent very little time in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   This week Ms. Lewinsky is in New York City visiting her mother.
On Tuesday she met with editors at St. Martin's Press, the
publisher of a book tentatively titled ``Monica's Story.'' Ms.
Lewinsky agreed to tell her side of the story in the book, which is
being written by Andrew Morton, author of a best-selling biography
of Diana, Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky also agreed to give an exclusive television
interview to Barbara Walters of ABC News for the program ``20/20.''
The interview was to be broadcast in February, but if Ms. Lewinsky
is scheduled to testify it could be delayed, Ms. Lewinsky's
associates said.
</P>
<P>
   In her immunity agreement, Ms. Lewinsky promised not to grant
interviews to any news organizations while the inquiry was
proceeding without the consent of the independent counsel. Since
then, Starr's office has repeatedly barred her from granting
interviews on any subject, even those that have nothing to do with
the inquiry.

FRENCH ACADEMY OBJECTS TO NAME `EUROLAND' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The French Academy officially advised Thursday that
``Euroland'' was not the proper word, in France at least, for the
group of 11 countries that have introduced the euro as their common
currency this year.
</P>
<P>
   Call it ``the euro zone,'' the Academy decreed Thursday: After
all, was the United States ``Dollarland''? Was Britain
``Sterlingland''?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Academy advises against the use of `Euroland,''' the
august ``Immortals'' advised in a communique Thursday afternoon,
``because it is not the name of a sovereign state or even a
confederation, but simply the area of application of a treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   The treaty is the Treaty of European Union negotiated in
Maastricht, the Netherlands, in December 1991. It laid the
foundations for a common currency that France, Germany, Belgium,
the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Italy, Ireland, Austria, Finland,
Spain and Portugal began making official over the New Year's
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in France keep saying the euro will finally enable
Europe to stand up to the almighty dollar on currency markets, so
the last thing they wanted the new money to be was a Trojan horse
for yet another Anglo-Saxon linguistic invasion of France. Yet
``Euroland'' seemed Anglo-American or, at best, German.
</P>
<P>
   So speakers of French had to act fast if franglais was not to
sabotage the currency project from the start. The daily Le Figaro
raised the alarm on Jan. 2, allowing that Euroland might arguably
have good Indo-European linguistic origins, but it sounded too
un-French. Later it asked its readers for suggestions about what to
call the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The euro bores me,'' Jean Baudrillard, a philosopher, replied,
but Francois Nourissier, president of the literary Goncourt
Academy, said, ``Write it Eurolande, with an `e' to Frenchify the
word.'' That is what Liberation, another daily, did in a special
supplement it published on the new currency on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   What effect the Academy's ruling will have remains to be seen.
The Bank of France, the Academy pointed out, used ``euro zone,''
but starting this year the bank is merely a branch of the European
Central Bank based in Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   A communique issued by President Jacques Chirac of France and
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan on Thursday afternoon called
for new efforts to ensure greater stability in foreign exchange
markets after the introduction of the euro, but it diplomatically
avoided using any word at all to say where.

WHITE HOUSE, SENATE WRANGLE OVER WITNESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With hopes fading for a speedy end to a Senate
impeachment trial, White House officials Thursday said they are
assuming nothing and planning for everything.
</P>
<P>
   As the historic Senate trial began Thursday without agreement on
the rules or a schedule, the White House argued strenously against
allowing witnesses to be called, saying it would delay the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's lawyers would need time to question the
witnesses before they give their testimony, White House advisers
said. That could could signficantly delay the trial, perhaps by as
much as 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of the last impeachment trial in 1868, the White
House would have 30 days to respond in writing to the case
presented in the articles of impeachment. Clinton's defenders are
working under the assumption that the Senate would default to those
rules if it cannot agree to new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they get into the world of witnesses, everything is going
to be on the table. Who knows?'' said one senior White House
adviser. ``We have to plan for everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The preference of many Clinton advisers is to wrap up the trial
quickly. But aware of the growing prospects for a trial that could
stretch out over several weeks or more, they have begun preparing
new responses.
</P>
<P>
   To try to move the process along, the president's lawyers told a
bipartisan group of senators Wednesday night that he would agree to
have the case tried on the basis of the material contained in the
impeachment articles, if no witnesses are called or new evidence
presented.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials viewed the offer as a major concession to
House Republicans who want witnesses and are serving as prosecutors
for the Senate impeachment trial. White House Press Secretary
Joseph Lockhart Thursday said the White House would accept the
material, based on independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's referral
to Congress, even though it was ``the most prejudicial record that
could possibly exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said if the offer is rejected, Clinton's defense team
was prepared to open up ``a whole area of motions, discoveries and
depositions. And that takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said it would be unfair for the Senate to ask for
opening statements in the trial without having laid down the rules.
``Whether you're in a trial in the Senate or you're in traffic
court, the idea that when you go and start a proceeding that the
rules...are not clear to you at the beginning of the process is not
fair,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, White House aides are divided about the
merits of a long trial. Some say, from a political standpoint, a
longer trial could work against the president because it would make
it take public attention away from Clinton's presidential duties.
Others say it would improve Democrats' prospects in the 2000
election, because the electorate is already unhappy with
Republicans' handling of impeachment issue.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials deny fearing that a longer trial could add
a level of unpredictability that could work to the president's
disadvantage. Instead, said Lockhart, ``There's a real concern that
a longer trial will make everybody in this country think we're even
crazier than they already think we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Thursday remained publicly aloof from such questions,
leaving that to his lawyers and aides. On what was among the most
momentous days of his presidency, he sought to project an air of
business as uususal.
</P>
<P>
   In his only public appearance of the day _ an event in the White
House East Room to promote a budget proposal to triple funding for
after-school programs _ the president made no references to the
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he mused about his 20 years of championing education
causes. ``Everybody just gets once chance. Everyone just has one
life. This is about giving people a chance to make the most of that
one life.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few references to the import of the day came from
Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who joined him for the
event. ``So many of us in the Congress and Senate look forward to
the time when we will have the opportunity to get back to the
business of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, according to his aides, did not watch the Senate
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   As Chief Justice William H. Rhenquist swore in senators for the
trial, the president sat alone with Vice President Al Gore in a
private dining room, just off the Oval Office, having their weekly
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton spent the morning exercising, catching up on
paperwork, and making phone calls from the White House residence
while the House was formally presenting the two articles of
impeachment to the Senate. Thursday evening, the president returned
to the East Room to pose for pictures with 75 rookie players from
Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is watching the polls more closely than he's
watching the Congress,'' explained Clinton's former Labor Secretary
Robert Reich, a Brandeis University economist. ``The president can
go about the motions of being president, but nobody is paying
attention. It's difficult to break through the loud noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Several White House aides and outside advisers say the president
wins, regardless of whether or not the Senate decides to hold a
full-blown trial with witnesses, because of his high job-approval
rating. But some say they prefer not to go through the ordeal of a
Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster and informal White House
adviser, said that along with mounting an aggressive legal defense,
Clinton's advisers would mount an aggressive public relations
defense of the president, if there's a long trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a public-opinion track, that makes it clear to
the American people that the Senate has been hijacked by the
radicals in the Republican Party in a way that leaves Bill Clinton
the only one focused on the country's business,'' he said. ``And
those are two very strong tracks to be on.''
</P>
<P>
   But, James Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House special
counsel, said simply: ``It's a win-win situation if we could just
get this over soon.''

BUSH HINTS AT SCALING BACK TAX CUTS OR SPENDING PRIORITIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
and R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush said Thursday he still
wanted to slash $2.6 billion from Texans' tax bills. But he hinted
that he and the Legislature may have to scale back the tax cut or
his spending priorities in the face of budgetary restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush stopped short of backing down on the tax cut pledges he
made during his recent re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) we're all going to have to adjust our sights'' if enough
money isn't available, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush commented one day before Carole Keeton Rylander, the new
state comptroller, was scheduled to publicly release her first
revenue estimate for the legislative session that convenes Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One source, who was briefed privately Thursday, said Rylander
planned to trim $500 million to $700 million from the extra $6.3
billion in revenue that her predecessor, Democrat John Sharp, had
projected in a preliminary estimate for legislative leaders last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp's preliminary projection included a $3.7 billion surplus
at the end of this budget period Aug. 31 plus $2.6 billion in
economic growth over the next two-year budget period.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander wants $400 million of the surplus to be dedicated to
the state's rainy-day fund to be held in reserve for years of
budget shortages, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander was to publicly release her revenue projection Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller's revenue projection is crucial to the
Legislature's budget-setting process because the Texas Constitution
prohibits deficit financing.
</P>
<P>
   There also are other obstacles to Bush's priorities. One is a
constitutional cap on state spending increases, which apparently
won't be affected by Rylander's revenue estimate, and another is
projected growth in required spending on increased school
enrollment and other existing programs.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Rob Junell, chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, has said those restrictions could keep the Legislature
from spending the entire surplus. Junell, D-San Angelo, said the
spending cap plus the required extra spending will leave the
Legislature with only about $2 billion for funding new programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislative Budget Board, the Legislature's budget arm, has
adopted the spending cap, which is tied to the state's economic
growth rate, but it can be skirted by the full Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he were willing to reduce the size of the tax cut or
reduce his spending priorities, if necessary, because of the
spending cap or other budgetary restrictions, Bush replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just have to see. I'm not willing to concede yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there ought to be property tax relief, sales tax
relief and (a business) tax credit and a reform of the franchise
tax to provide significant relief for 176,000 small businesses,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a drumbeat for a tax cut. I hope so. I
campaigned on it. The people endorsed it.''
</P>
<P>
   During his re-election campaign, Bush promised to cut $2 billion
from local school property taxes, with the state making up the
difference in increased funding to school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the state reimbursement would be tied to a local
district's action in reducing property tax rates. Two years ago, at
the governor's urging, the Legislature increased a tax break for
homeowners and reimbursed school districts for lost revenue.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Bush also wants to trim state sales and business
taxes by $600 million and increase state funding of public schools
by $1.6 billion _ on top of the property tax reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   Bush believes some $1 billion of the extra money should go to
local school districts to use as they please on classroom
instruction, including teacher pay raises. The remainder would go
to school construction, reading programs, textbooks and programs to
end social promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is what we'll do with the money. My priority is
public education, and my second priority is a tax cut,'' the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he wanted to increase the state's share of public
education funding, which was less than half of the total when he
took office four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the state's portion of the public education budget,
he said, was the best way to reduce disparities in funding among
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``And by dedicating the lion's share of new money (to
education), we've been able to take some pressure off of property
taxes,'' he added.

 &HT;    Georgia seeks niche in microchip design
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It took a California company to start Georgia on a new
path to create thousands of high-paying high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gov.-elect Roy Barnes announced the Yamacraw
Mission, an initiative to make Georgia the world leader in
designing microchips for the telecommunications industry. A key
part of the effort is a commitment to hire 86 university faculty
members. The idea is that if the state produces and retains the
high-tech chip designers and other workers the industry needs,
businesses will follow.
</P>
<P>
   State and industry officials have been working on the plan for
months, but it all started with a Silicon Valley company's
worldwide search for states _ or even nations _ willing to produce
the bounty of new electronic design engineers that will be needed
in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Cadence Design Systems, has a customer list that is
a Who's Who of the electronics industry, including Toshiba,
Motorola, Intel and Samsung. San Jose, Calif.-based Cadence, a
$1.15 billion company that has 4,000 employees, supplies its
customers with software to design microchips and other electronic
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Cadence's customers can't find enough chip
designers. Pay averages $120,000 for university-trained designers
who use software to work out the complex layout of the 100 million
connections in a single chip. But in California's Silicon Valley,
there are thousands of design, software and other high-tech jobs
that remain unfilled. Ultimately, the shortage threatens to hold
back progress in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure convinced Cadence Senior Vice President M. Robert
Leach to begin a worldwide hunt on behalf of his clients. He's
bounced across three continents and at least a dozen states on his
mission. At each stop, he asks government leaders for their help in
coming up with ways to train and recruit more chip designers. In
return, Leach said, they have a shot at attracting more companies
and jobs. The effort is just a tiny fraction of what Cadence's
does, but Leach said he sees the payoff for his own company: better
relations with its customers, an inside line on where clients will
open operations next and a crack at getting more workers for
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's first payoff could come as early as this winter, Leach
said Thursday. He said he knows of two companies planning a joint
venture in chip design to be located in Georgia. He declined to
identify the companies involved or the number of jobs expected.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Scotland has followed Cadence's lead with plans to offer
new technical degree programs under four universities. Two other
states in this country are considering their own programs, Leach
said, though he declined to identify them. Georgia is the first to
publicly sign on to the initiative in the United States. The other
two states that may come on board will take different approaches
and focus on different industry segments than Georgia, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leech emphasized that the Yamacraw Mission is a collaborative
strategy. While Cadence started the process, the program is the
result of brainstorming among university and state officials,
Cadence executives and others on how Georgia can match its
resources to the needs of the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we got one of the best at understanding our potential
customers, which are these companies we want to attract and we want
to grow here,'' said Annie Hunt Burriss, the University System of
Georgia's vice chancellor for economic development. ``They were the
catalyst.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed faculty additions will nearly double the number of
state university faculty members focusing on chip design and
related fields. The additions will be in electrical engineering and
computer sciences at Georgia Tech, the University of Georgia,
Georgia State University, Savannah State University, Georgia
Southern University, Armstrong Atlantic State University, Southern
Polytechnic State University and Kennesaw State University.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new faculty will be added at Georgia Tech. The
initiative also calls for new research partnerships with industry.
Those would be based at the Georgia Center for Advanced
Telecommunications Technology near Georgia Tech. And it includes
new marketing by the Georgia Department of Industry, Trade and
Tourism, as well as efforts to convince Georgia Tech alumni in
other states to return to jobs here. Barnes will ask the
Legislature for $13.6 million this year to fund the first
installment.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, Barnes predicted, will help Georgia build one of
the nation's top five technology-based economies. ``Georgia's
future in job growth and in income growth lies in the high-tech
field,'' Barnes said. ``It's the greatest potential for growth that
we have.''
</P>
<P>
   THE YAMACRAW MISSION
</P>
<P>
   About the initiative
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia officials say they expect dramatic growth in the
microchip design industry. It will be fueled, in part, by dramatic
advances in what chips will be able to do and increased emphasis on
how they are designed. Among the predictions: The functions of a
cellphone circuit board, which now is nearly as big as the outline
of the phone itself, will be handled by a chip about the size of an
eraser on the end of a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eight state universities will form an education cluster and
increase capacity to expand the pool of engineers needed for
electronic design work. The schools:

PROSECUTORS HOPE TO CALL UP TO 15 WITNESSES IN CLINTON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Senate leaders struggled to set parameters for a
trial, the House members appointed to prosecute President Clinton
said Thursday that they wanted to present testimony from as many as
15 witnesses, including Monica Lewinsky and an array of current and
former presidential advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The members acknowledged that if Senate leaders allowed them
less time to present witnesses than the two weeks they had
requested, they might have to winnow the list to as few as five
people. But the members, all Republicans from the House Judiciary
Committee, said they were intent on bringing many of the players
who have occupied center stage in the Lewinsky drama back for
repeat performances.
</P>
<P>
   Although that cast is heavy with people who support Clinton or
have made statements that suggest their testimony would do him more
good than harm, the House prosecutors said that the ability to ask
those witnesses direct questions, and to enable senators to assess
first-hand the believability of the answers, would help the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's a conflict in testimony, the only way to resolve
it is to see the demeanor of the witnesses, evaluate their
credibility, look into their eyes and determine where the truth
is,'' Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, one of the 13 House
Republicans on the prosecution team, said as he left one of several
strategy sessions the group held Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what humanizes the case,'' Hutchinson said. ``That's
what puts the meat on the bones.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' ability to call witnesses and the amount of
time those witnesses spend giving testimony will ultimately be
determined by Senate leaders. Among the many points they were still
discussing Thursday was whether witnesses whose testimony might
prove embarrassing could be questioned outside the presence of
television cameras and public spectators.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee was criticized for not calling
witnesses germane to the case when it held its impeachment hearings
late last year. The prosecutors say that was appropriate, given the
extensive written record, but now the stakes are higher, with the
president's removal from office under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Several aspects of the strategy they may employ came into
sharper focus Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they hoped to string together testimony from
presidential advisers in a way that supported the House's
contention that Clinton enlisted his staff and friends in a
cover-up by giving them false information about his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky that he knew they would repeat to reporters and
the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Without being specific, the prosecutors said that showcasing
some of what Ms. Lewinsky and Clinton's advisers have said would
help prove that Clinton obstructed justice, as the second article
of impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It potentially could develop the nuances of the conspiracy to
obstruct justice and file false affidavits that you don't get from
the grand jury testimony,'' said Rep. Lindsey Graham of South
Carolina, another prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica Lewinsky said nobody ever told her to lie,'' Graham
continued. ``I believe that. That doesn't mean she didn't lie with
the assistance of others. Most crimes, you don't say, `We're going
to obstruct justice at noon. Don't be late.' It's never that
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham added, ``Every grand jury witness wasn't asked all of the
questions there are to be asked.'' He named Sidney Blumenthal, a
close presidential aide, as a witness who House prosecutors
believed could be questioned more thoroughly than he had been by
the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., said that the prosecution team was also
discussing calling John Podesta, Erskine Bowles, Harold Ickes and
Dick Morris to testify. Betty Currie, the president's secretary,
and Vernon Jordan, a close friend and legal adviser to the
president, would almost certainly be called, Bryant said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although he and other prosecutors would not go into detail about
what they wanted to ask witnesses, they are undoubtedly interested
in exploring certain statements that Blumenthal and Morris made to
the grand jury that were damaging to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Morris testified that when he told Clinton last January that
private polls showed that Americans would be unwilling to forgive
the president for perjury or obstruction of justice, Clinton said,
``Well, we just have to win then.''
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal told the grand jury that Clinton's first comments to
him about Ms. Lewinsky last January were that she was a malicious,
mendacious stalker.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors could use these bits of testimony to assert
that Clinton exhibited a propensity to do whatever it took to
conceal the truth about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the prosecution team also indicated a
particular interest in Jordan's testimony, suggesting that it too
contained damning evidence against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vernon Jordan's not going to say the president is lying,''
Bryant said. ``But Vernon Jordan has a very different version _
after he found the job for Monica Lewinsky, he calls the president
and says, `Mission accomplished.' The president does not remember
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cannon of Utah, another prosecutor, added, ``If
you look at Vernon Jordan, he's a very complex man. I think he's
going to testify honestly. He's going to be in this town for a very
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors acknowledged the striking oddity of their case,
which relies almost entirely on people whose actions and statements
have indicated a desire to protect the president or a disinterest
in punishing him. They also conceded that having these people
testify was to some degree a roll of the dice.
</P>
<P>
   But Graham and other prosecutors said that they do not see any
credible alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way you conduct a trial,'' Graham said. ``If you
want to get at the truth, the best way to get there is to listen to
the key players and evaluate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said that most of the witnesses the prosecutors planned
to call probably would not testify voluntarily and would have to be
subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   He included Ms. Lewinsky on that list, but said her testimony
was perhaps most critical, because senators needed to evaluate the
contradictions in what she and the president have said about how
often they were alone together and how many gifts they exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   He also conceded that her credibility would be challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president says we were not alone anytime and she says
we were alone, then obviously they're going to have to attack her
credibility and say she's lying about that,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, a former federal prosecutor, is one of the four members
of the prosecution team who have been assigned the job of
questioning witnesses. The others are two other former federal
prosecutors, Hutchinson and Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, and a former
county prosecutor, Rep. James Rogan of California.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican official working on the prosecution team said that
Henry Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, sent word
Thursday to the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi,
that the the House prosecutors wanted two weeks for witnesses, a
period that probably would allow a dozen or more witnesses to be
called.
</P>
<P>
   But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
the prosecutors expected to get a week or less. In a week, the
official said, prosecutors might still be able present a dozen
witnesses, because in some cases the prosecutors have just one or
two questions for a witness. In other cases, they simply need a
witness to corroborate some aspect of the record, which might then
be offered into evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said that even if prosecutors were able to call every
witness they wanted, ``We think we'd be able to finish the case in
the Senate's time frame, which would be the middle of February.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said that it was possible that prosecutors would call
a few witnesses who did not testify before the grand jury that was
convened by the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, but that it
would not be for the purpose of expanding upon the accusations
against Clinton or presenting new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said that there were no plans to call Linda Tripp or her
book agent, Lucianne Goldberg, to testify. He also said he did not
see any need to play for senators the tape recordings that Ms.
Tripp made of Ms. Lewinsky discussing her relationship with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the live witness,'' he said, referring to Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Cannon said that House members were trying to be careful only to
do what they considered essential. ``We're not going to call
witnesses unless they go to the very core issues of perjury and
obstruction of justice,'' he said.

IN FLORIDA, A LIFETIME OF LUCK FROM FINDING A CROSS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Greece, Fla.)  By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TARPON SPRINGS, Fla. _ As the Greek Orthodox Archbishop of the
Americas tossed a white wooden cross into the green bayou, a young
man, destined for glory, plunged himself into the cold water after
it, while an old man, warm and dry on the bank, sank deep into his
own legend.
</P>
<P>
   It began on an unusually cold day in Florida, after freeze
warnings the night before. Thousands of Greek Orthodox Christians,
here to celebrate one of their faith's holiest days, ringed that
bayou as Archbishop Spyridon, on a platform facing the water, held
out the Cross of the Epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   Before him, perched in a semicircle of dinghies, waited 60
teen-age boys, legs flexed, fingers clenching and unclenching.
</P>
<P>
   As the cross tumbled toward the water, the boys sprang from the
little boats, making the water roil. In seconds, 16-year-old Jason
Kolbe surfaced with the cross raised high in one hand, mouth wide
open in a scream of joy. The boy who finds it, said Greek Orthodox
Christians, is the chosen of God.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty years ago Friday, it was Hercules Ypsilantis who dived
into the gloom of Spring Bayou here in this Greek fishing village
in west Florida, who knelt on the bank to receive the special
blessing from the Archbishop of the Americas, who became a living
symbol of Christ's resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   A lifetime later, he can still warm himself in its glow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe in some things, here. Everybody doesn't, but
we do,'' said Ypsilantis, who was 17 in 1949 when he outswam the
other young men of his village to win his place in local history
and the right to stand at the center of what has become the
grandest celebration of the Epiphany by Greek Orthodox Christians
in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   As the modern-day divers vied for that glory, ``I see myself
going down, and I see myself coming up with it in my hand,'' he
said. ``This has been a blessing to me, all my life. It is for
everyone. If you have never felt it, it's hard to explain how it
feels.''
</P>
<P>
   The Epiphany in Greek Orthodox teaching celebrates Christ's
baptism in the River Jordan by John the Baptist. It was then that
God said of Jesus, ``This is my Son,'' the Bible says. The word
``epiphany'' means other things, including the appearance of the
Magi, to Protestants and Roman Catholics in other parts of the
world. But for 80 years, here in this city built by Greek sponge
fishermen, it has given teen-age boys a singular gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everything,'' said Jason Kolbe, whose eyes flooded with
tears as he climbed from the 65-degree water. ``All my life, I've
been waiting for this. All my life.''
</P>
<P>
   People here believe that the diver is blessed, with a year's
worth of good fortune, at least. But some also believe that winning
the cross can be a turning point in a young man's life, a kind of
divine intervention. It may be something grand, like wealth or
power, or just humble good luck.
</P>
<P>
   Ypsilantis drove a Greyhound bus for 30 years, after finding
glory in retrieving the cross. He never had an accident, in the
millions of miles he drove in the western and southwestern United
States
</P>
<P>
   He believes it was part of his blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember there were five of us in the boat I was in. Three
of us are still alive,'' said Ypsilantis, who is 67. ``If you
believe in something, you can survive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some of the divers went on to wealth, some died young. But time
and time again, as the past divers came forth to honor the new
hero, they swore that what good fortune they had in life _ healthy
children, wives who died peacefully, boats that never sank _ was
tied to their one shining moment.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe's brother, Anestis Karistinos, retrieved the cross in
1991, when he was 16. Now 24, he has his own charter fishing and
diving business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll guide him,'' Karistinos said, looking at his brother
answer questions from reporters at St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox
Church. ``It gave me more faith. For the rest of his life, when he
gets down, he can remember this day.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a hard-won thing. The bayou water is not deep, just a few
feet in places, but it is an ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   The weather and water were both chilly when the divers, walking
at the head of a procession from St. Nicholas, broke into a run,
some diving and others leaping into the water. They swam to their
dinghies, and had to pull themselves up the slick sides. Then,
soaked, shivering, they waited for several minutes as the
Archbishop and his helpers went through their lengthy blessing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with 61 divers, many of them, like Kolbe, students
at Tarpon Springs High School and other Pinellas County schools.
But one of the young men had to be carried away by rescue workers
because of hypothermia.
</P>
<P>
   When the cross was finally thrown, Kolbe seemed to burst ahead
of the others, his friends said, before the eddies from the sinking
cross had vanished, showing him exactly where it was.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, other divers carried him on their shoulders to
the church. A middle-aged man rushed out of the crowd to touch his
shoulder. ``You have to touch him, for luck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers rushed here and there with quilts and bed spreads and
dry clothes for their sons.
</P>
<P>
   Ypsilantis, who came home to Tarpon Springs after he retired
from the bus company, remembers the water was muddy the day he
found the cross, too. But the cross seemed to glow, guiding him to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shines in the water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people would say it was just the gold paint. The divers who
have clutched it, who have risen from the water with it held high,
wonder if it was something more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' Ypsilantis said, ``the biggest thrill I ever had.''

POLICE CHIEF SEEKS REVIEW OF D.C. FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bowing to public complaints and his own concerns,
the District of Columbia's police chief has asked the Justice
Department to review all fatal shootings by district police
officers over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual request, for an investigation by the civil rights
division, was immediately followed by a letter from Mayor Anthony
Williams to Attorney General Janet Reno, in which he told her that
a review is ``critically important'' for assuring the public that
police officers are acting appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   At her weekly news conference Thursday, Reno responded favorably
to the request, saying she was ``committed to doing everything we
can'' to assist the police chief, Charles Ramsey. She added that
she expected a Justice Department review and any recommendations
for change might serve as ``a model for what could be done in
departments across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Ramsey conceded that wavering public
trust in the ability of district police officers to respond
properly in potentially deadly situations had undermined his
confidence in police department policies and prompted him to make a
request ``that is normally not done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually,'' he said of Justice Department investigators,
``they're knocking on our door.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ramsey said that he first grew alarmed over irregularities
shortly after he was hired in May, he sought Justice Department
help only after The Washington Post reported recently that district
police officers shot and killed 87 people in the 1990s, an
unusually high number given the city's population, fewer than
550,000.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper also reported that police shootings increased
dramatically after 1989, when a large number of officers with
inadequate training were added to the force and officers switched
from revolvers to semiautomatic handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The requests for a review also followed the latest incident in
which police used deadly force. On Tuesday, a 40-year-old man,
Joseph Durant Jr., died after he was shot by police who said he
lunged at them with knives from a doorway.
</P>
<P>
   Three officers involved in the incident were placed on
administrative leave, pending an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After considering the rising degree of public concern in the
district and reviewing a backlog of cases, Ramsey said he had
concluded that inviting an independent outside agency to examine
police practices and policies was the only way to regain
credibility for a department that has suffered though a steady
stream of scandals in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use of force is a serious issue,'' said Ramsey, who was hired
after the previous chief, Larry Soulsby, resigned when ethics
questions were raised about his conduct. ``But let the cards fall
where they may. This isn't a witch hunt, but we can't go on with a
cloud hanging over our head. The public has to be confident that
officers are making the right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey, a former deputy superintendent of police in Chicago,
predicted that a Justice Department review would ultimately benefit
``every city across the country.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his letter sent Wednesday to Deputy Attorney General Eric
Holder, Ramsey said he had recently instituted efforts to help
officers when they confronted situations in which deadly force
might become an option. They included new training techniques and
the carrying of nonlethal weapons like expandable batons and Mace.
</P>
<P>
   But he told Holder that he became convinced that even those
measures left him without the ``full confidence that our department
currently possesses the resources needed'' to satisfy public
complaints that some officers have been using excessive force.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was sworn in as the district's new mayor last
Saturday, echoed Ramsey's concerns in his own letter sent
Wednesday, telling Reno that district residents had ``a right to
expect that their officers are abiding by strict standards'' when
they respond to potentially deadly situations.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Rosenblatt, executive director of the International
Association of Police Chiefs, said Ramsey's request to the Justice
Department is not unique. Rosenblatt said other police departments,
including those in Houston and Alexandria, Va., have recently
sought help in reviewing shootings as a way to calm public fears
that officers were acting inappropriately.

WHITE HOUSE RAISES PROSPECT OF LONG TRIAL IF WITNESSES ARE CALLED

 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Raising the specter of a trial that ``could go on
forever and ever,'' the White House warned on Thursday that if the
Senate calls witnesses to testify about President Clinton, it may
use every tool available to build his defense.
</P>
<P>
   The warning reflected both political and legal strategy.
Politically, the White House was trying to persuade Senate
Republicans to accept its proposal for a swift trial without
witnesses that would be confined to the impeachment case presented
by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But the warning also signaled that, if the proposal is rejected,
Clinton's lawyers will demand to interview prosecution witnesses
before they appear. They could also demand to see reams of
documents so far unavailable to the White House, Clinton's aides
said, and perhaps file legal motions challenging some testimony
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they open the proceeding up, both in terms of additional
areas and additional witnesses, it's impossible for anyone at this
point to say how it would be handled,'' said a senior White House
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He added, ``Right
now, since nothing's been resolved, everything's in play.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, insisted that the
Senate should not hear opening arguments before deciding whether to
call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me suggest if they take that course that they would have
difficulty meeting the basic test of fairness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, White House aides had emphasized that the conduct of
the trial was largely a matter for senators to decide among
themselves. Thursday's more aggressive remarks seemed to stem from
growing concern in Clinton's camp that the Senate was headed for a
protracted trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with a small bipartisan group of senators on
Wednesday night, White House officials offered to forswear several
legal options _ like demanding to cross-examine the witnesses Starr
used to build his case _ in what it presented as a bold concession
intended to speed the trial. In exchange, it asked for a Senate
rule that no witnesses would be called and no new evidence admitted
during Clinton's trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides said that they heard no response on Thursday to
their proposal from Republican Senate leaders, as negotiations over
the conduct of the trial broke down in partisan rancor. Republicans
and Democrats agreed on Thursday evening to meet on Friday to
discuss calling witnesses and other unresolved issues of procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart called Starr's impeachment case ``the most prejudicial
record that could possibly exist.'' Nevertheless, he said, Clinton
was prepared to accept that case as the entire basis of his trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are accepting that record,'' Lockhart said, ``despite the
fact that we don't know all the information it's based on, despite
the fact that it's untested and not cross-examined, despite the
fact that we know exculpatory information was left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that it was in the nation's interest to expedite the
trial, he expressed confidence that Clinton's lawyers could win his
acquittal without cross-examining the witnesses that Starr
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   But, White House officials said, their offer did not mean they
would accept the interpretation given the record by Starr or House
Republicans, or even the facts it contained. That is, White House
lawyers would still be expected to challenge the accuracy of
testimony by particular witnesses to the grand jury as well as the
significance placed upon the testimony by Starr and the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has benefits for the White House beyond shortening
the trial. If the Senate accepted the offer, Clinton would no
longer run the risk that some new evidence might be presented or
new allegations made against him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some independent experts saw the White House offer as a
dramatic, potentially risky move. ``It would be extremely rare, if
ever, that a criminal defense lawyer in a criminal case would agree
that hearsay testimony that had not been cross-examined would be
admissible,'' said Irvin Nathan, a criminal defense lawyer who is a
partner here with the firm of Arnold and Porter.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the White House was waiving the right to call
other witnesses to rebut that hearsay testimony. ``That would be
quite extraordinary, I would say to the point of nonexistent,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As they have for days, White House officials continued to insist
on Thursday that they could not develop, much less disclose, a
coherent defense strategy before knowing what kind of prosecution
the president would face. They remained silent on the question of
what witnesses they might call in response to any witnesses brought
by the House members conducting the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But they warned that if the Senate rejected Clinton's proposal,
the trial would be open-ended. ``Bringing witnesses in and not
stipulating to a record opens up a whole area of motions, discovery
and depositions,'' Lockhart said. ``And that takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House also says it would want to review evidence
accumulated by Starr that was not included in his referral to
Congress. Some of that evidence, White House aides argue, would be
exculpatory, but they will not insist on seeing it if the Senate
accepts their offer.
</P>
<P>
   And White House lawyers say that they should have the right to
depose witnesses before they testify to the senators, in order to
prepare for cross-examination. In a criminal trial, unlike civil
litigation, a defense lawyer normally does not have the right to
depose a witness, unless for reasons of illness or geography the
witness cannot attend the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But James J. Brosnahan, a San Francisco trial lawyer who
prosecuted Caspar Weinberger in the Iran-contra matter, said that
the Senate should bend to a White House request to depose
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not normal criminal procedure, but it could well be
normal impeachment procedure,'' he said. ``I think it's a
reasonable request.''

AGEISM: A BOOMER WAR CRY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Don't say ``full employment'' or ``tight labor market''
around an unemployed, 40-year-old-plus worker.
</P>
<P>
   I warn you: There is no more frustrated and hurt person in the
job market today.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after they talk about being let go in a ``downsizing'' or
``reorganization,'' they hesitantly reveal their dark suspicions _
that age discrimination contributed to their ousters and that age
discrimination is thwarting their re-employment at comparable pay
or prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Can they prove it?
</P>
<P>
   Not easily. For one thing, older workers don't appear to be a
very litigious lot.
</P>
<P>
   Equal Employment Opportunity Commission statistics from fiscal
years 1991 through 1998 show that age-related charges were only
one-fifth of the discrimination complaints filed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, age-related charges have fallen both in raw numbers and
percentages of total EEOC filings, from a high of 27.5 percent in
1991 to 19.1 percent in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Over that eight-year period, race figured in 37 percent of the
discrimination charges; sex, 29.4 percent; age, 22 percent;
disability, 18.6 percent; retaliation, 17 percent; national origin,
8.9 percent; religion, 1.9 percent; and equal pay, 1.5 percent.
(Disability data go back only seven years.)
</P>
<P>
   The fact that older workers aren't taking age discrimination
complaints to the mat in large numbers may say three things: that
they eventually get another decent, if not comparable, job; that
it's too much hassle to pursue a complaint; and that they can't be
absolutely sure they have a winnable case.
</P>
<P>
   Past outcomes indicate age discrimination suspicions rarely
translate into monetary benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, more than six out of 10 age
discrimination charges were found to have no reasonable cause of
action by the EEOC. Only one in eight persons who charged age
discrimination ended up with any kind of monetary settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Human resource consultants say older workers are getting wiser,
though, about how to prove suspicions of discrimination. AlignMark,
a company that provides workplace training to help employers
understand discrimination legislation, recently alerted clients to
these practices that may be considered age-discriminatory:
</P>
<P>
   -- Using financial incentives to induce retirement.
</P>
<P>
   -- Redeploying younger workers while eliminating older ones in a
reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   -- Forcing a choice between early retirement or layoff without
health benefits and little chance of recall.
</P>
<P>
   -- Failing to offer equal job training and career development
opportunities to older workers.
</P>
<P>
   -- Failing to offer flexible work options or benefits to older
workers that are available to younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   -- Leaving older workers out of key corporate activities.
</P>
<P>
   As baby boomers fill up the older worker category, sheer numbers
are going to force more attention to age discrimination. Those who
cut their protest teeth on the Vietnam War, civil rights, abortion
and the like aren't likely to stew as privately as the earlier
generation.

AIRTOUCH TOUCHED BY GOLD

<TEXT>
<P>
   Samuel Ginn, chief executive of the Pacific Telesis Group,
raised eyebrows nearly six years ago when he decided to spin out
the California-based Bell company's mobile telephone service and to
jump ship to the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year later, the wireless company, renamed AirTouch
Communications Inc., sold its first shares to the public and
embarked on an expansion spree that took it beyond the West Coast
and into Europe, the Middle East and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Now San Francisco-based AirTouch is the world's largest
independent wireless carrier, a fetching takeover prize that has
attracted two suitors in recent days, with a third possibly in the
wings. The pursuers _ Bell Atlantic Corp. and Vodafone Group PLC of
Britain _ are said to have made bids ranging from $43 billion to
$54 billion, while MCI WorldCom Inc. reportedly plans an even
higher offer.
</P>
<P>
   All are tantalized by the expectation that wireless
communications someday will overtake wired local and long-distance
calling. Acquiring a big wireless operator like AirTouch would help
them become a major telecommunications player in a global industry
that is expected to consolidate into a half dozen or so
megacarriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``AirTouch is a unique asset,'' said Susan Passoni, a managing
director at SG Cowen Securities in Boston. ``It has a phenomenal
portfolio in Europe and has become the strongest regional player
among independent wireless companies.''
</P>
<P>
   AirTouch's pell-mell growth in one of the most closely watched
telecommunications sectors has made the company a Wall Street
favorite. The company's strong financial position, large worldwide
customer base and wireless network and technology have made the
company's stock soar in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Under chief execuitve Ginn, AirTouch has expanded
internationally in Italy, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Egypt
and Japan. In April, it spent $5.9 billion to acquire the former US
West wireless service, giving it new markets in the western United
States. It also formed several wireless joint ventures in the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The result: AirTouch has 7.6 million US customers, making it the
second largest cellular carrier after AT&AMP;T. Including international
customers, AirTouch has more than 16 million mobile phone
customers. It added 735,000 customers in the first three quarters
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic and Vodafone already are familiar with AirTouch.
Bell Atlantic and AirTouch created PrimeCo Personal Communications,
a wireless carrier headquartered in Chicago that serves 11 markets
in the United States and has 700,000 subscribers. AirTouch and
Vodafone have joint ventures in Egypt and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, the New York-based phone company that serves 13
East Coast states, is pressing to become a national
telecommunications player. If it succeeds in acquiring AirTouch and
also completes its $52.9 billion previously announced acquisition
of GTE Corp., it would have a wireless network in 44 states and
more than a dozen international markets.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, consolidation among the major telecommunications
players will require having a national ``footprint'' in wireless
communications. This would enable customers to make calls from
their mobile phones anywhere in the country and pay a single rate
without roaming and long-distance charges. Snaring AirTouch would
let Bell Atlantic accomplish its goal of matching AT&AMP;T, Sprint and
Nextel with a coast-to-coast wireless network.
</P>
<P>
   For Vodafone, acquiring AirTouch would let it make a foray into
the big US market and to expand in Europe. Vodafone has more than 9
million wireless subscribers. It is the largest cellular carrier in
the United Kingdom and also is strong elsewhere in Northern Europe.
AirTouch would help it expand south in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom, based in Jackson, Miss., Thursday declined to
comment on a report in USA Today that it plans to make a bid for
AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its major rivals _ AT&AMP;T and Sprint _ MCI WorldCom does
not own its own wireless system, although it resells other
carriers' wireless services. Owning AirTouch would enable MCI
WorldCom to quickly become a wireless player, albeit on a regional
basis. Analysts expect it would follow up an AirTouch purchase with
acquisitions of other regional wireless companies. ``These bidders
for AirTouch are all making interesting strategic moves that will
scale up the participants while also consolidating the wireless
community to a handful of major carriers,'' said Henry B. Weil,
senior lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's
Sloan School of Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is all part of the long-term scenario of having four or
five megacarriers in telecom, similar to how we have seen industry
consolidation in airlines and banks. The patchwork of wireless
players has given way to regional players and now nationwide
carriers.''
</P>
<P>
   AirTouch shares closed at 82, up 2 1/8. Bell Atlantic stock
ended at 56, up 1/8. MCI WorldCom fell 3 1/4 to 75 1/8.

<P>
   What was supposed to be a good season for retailers turned out
to be a great one instead, as last-minute and postholiday shopping
propelled December sales gains to their highest in half a decade,
according to figures released Thursday by merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Fears that the impeachment of President Clinton, the bombing of
Iraq and unseasonably warm weather would dampen holiday buying
turned out to be unfounded. The humming of the strong economy _ the
best real-wage growth since 1985 and an impressive end-of-year
rebound by the stock market _ was the only tune Americans seemed to
hear. ``Consumer confidence has remained outrageously high,'' said
David Blitzer, the chief economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   In all, same-store sales, or sales in stores open at least a
year, a standard industry measure, rose 5.2 percent, according to
the Goldman Sachs Retail Composite Index. Last year, December
same-store sales rose a hardy 4.1 percent, but not since 1994, when
retailers posted a 5.6 percent gain, has the growth been so robust.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Baum, a retail analyst with Goldman, Sachs, said, ``You
are not going to hear too many retailers complaining that Santa
Claus was not kind to them.''
</P>
<P>
   But in what is becoming a seasonal pattern, shoppers kept
merchants waiting until the last minute to deliver the good news.
Three weeks into the season, retailers were reporting solid but not
stellar numbers. The week before Christmas, however, had the four
busiest shopping days of the year, according to the International
Council of Shopping Centers.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Allen, a spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., said: ``We had
a good holiday period, but it was late in coming. The week before
Christmas we saw a real spike in business.'' Allen said that
although late buying had clearly become a characteristic of the
Christmas season, it was also part of a larger trend. ``People are
generally buying closer to need; back-to-school is another good
example,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen's description of Wal-Mart's sales as ``good'' was modest,
to say the least. Discounters continued to reign supreme among
merchants. And Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world, could
have powered the holiday season increases practically by itself
with a same-store sales increase of 9.4 percent. Right behind
Wal-Mart were Target, a unit of Dayton Hudson Corp., and Family
Dollar Stores Inc., with increases of about 7 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   And after shoppers got their cut-price scented candles and
Furbys, there was still plenty of money left to spread around other
sectors. Jewelers, from upscale Tiffany &AMP; Co. to mass-marketer Zale
Corp., had sparkling seasons as shoppers snapped up diamond-stud
earrings and gold bracelets. Specialty stores, led by Gap Inc.,
whose sales rose 19 percent, also had reason to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   Even many of the department-store chains, which were pummeled in
recent years, fared well this season. In particular, Federated
Department Stores Inc., which owns Bloomingdale's and Macy's,
announced a startling same-store sales rise of 5.7 percent,
compared with a 1 percent rise last year.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Sanger, vice president for corporate affairs, could not
help but brag a bit. ``At the beginning of the year, after last
year's disappointing holiday season, we really sat down and made a
concerted effort to develop strategies for this Christmas selling
period,'' she said. ``And apparently it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sanger said that the company had been especially successful
with gift-giving promotions that highlighted select items with
careful packaging and heavy promotion. Packages of fruit preserves
and jellies nestled in wooden crates and matched berry-colored
sweater sets were big hits, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone did well, however. J.C. Penney Co. saw same-store
sales slide a whopping 7.6 percent despite its own preseason
forecast of a rise of 1 percent to 2 percent. Theda Page Whitehead,
J.C. Penney's public relations manager, blamed warm weather and a
spate of early retirements in 1997 that left the company with 500
to 600 new store managers.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us Inc. ended a disastrous year with a painful
drubbing as discounters cut further into its territory,
particularly on electronic toys like video games. ``There was a
lack of hot toys,'' said the company's chief financial officer,
Louis Lipschitz.
</P>
<P>
   Nordstrom Inc. will not release its sales figures until the end
of its fourth quarter, but analysts were predicting same-store
numbers for December would be down by 5 percent to 7 percent. The
company would not comment on its performance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The next question is whether the sales announcements will
translate into solid earnings. In recent years, merchants have been
forced to cut prices to attract increasingly demanding customers.
The result is that increased sales come at the sacrifice of profit.
This year, the promotional environment was as fierce as ever, but
retailers said they anticipated that and planned accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Many retail analysts are optimistic that profits will be solid
when earnings are announced in several weeks. Jeff Feiner, an
analyst with Lehman Brothers, said: ``On balance, the companies
that did very well _ the Wal-Marts, Costcos and the Targets _ did
not give away the store. We believe profitability was very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Van Kleeck, president of the National Retail Federation,
said he also expected overall profits would be good, but he added a
note of caution. ``Many retailers had planned high markdowns,'' he
said. ``But I am not sure quite so high'' as what they eventually
took.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Wollan Fan, a partner with Andersen Consulting's global
retail practice, was even more skeptical. ``It is a mixed bag of
the desperates and the deliberates,'' she said of the stores that
engaged in heavy price cutting. ``Not everyone who got good sales
figures are going to make it to the winner's circle when earnings
are announced.''

EDITORIAL: THE SENATE TAKES OVER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Jan. 8:
</P>
<P>
   After the strife in the House, the opening of the Senate trial
of President Clinton reassuringly looked decorous. Sen. Strom
Thurmond, who was born only 34 years after Andrew Johnson's
impeachment, swore in the big, calm-looking Chief Justice, William
H. Rehnquist. Then after a period of turmoil over the issue of
calling witnesses, the majority leader, Trent Lott, and his
Democratic counterpart, Tom Daschle, ended the day by announcing a
plan to seek agreement on rules for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders' decision to tamp down party feuding and call a
bipartisan caucus of all senators for Thursday morning brought a
surprisingly promising end to a grimly historic day. It is too
early to declare that this marks the emergence of a rational
statesmanship that has been missing in the House and at the White
House. But the Senate has a momentous opportunity to adopt rules
that would shorten the trial, avoid months of redundant testimony
and allow passage of a censure that the public and the evidence
demand.
</P>
<P>
   We are especially impressed that the Senate leadership has stood
up to the effort by the House impeachment managers to dictate the
calling of multiple witnesses. Procedure is solely the province of
the Senate. The Democrats' plan to hear prosecution and defense
arguments on the exhaustive written record and call no witnesses at
all is still the best way to go. This would not amount to
suppression of evidence, since the House Judiciary Committee has no
relevant new evidence to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Lott failed last week in his effort to get the GOP to accept a
trial on the written record. Even so, he sent an important signal
Thursday by saying that witnesses should be called only with
``justification.'' This hints at a compromise that would limit
testimony and require a majority vote to authorize each person
called. That suggests that both leaders will work to avoid what
Lott called ``a cavalcade of witnesses'' that would bog the trial
down for months without producing any new information about
Clinton's misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   By seeking to call witnesses, the managers from the House
Judiciary Committee hope to make one last stab at turning public
opinion toward removal rather than censure. But the House case was
argued exhaustively on national television. A consensus formed that
has been endorsed by the public and a majority of the Senate. Bill
Clinton failed in his duties to the presidency. He lied under oath.
His private character is deeply flawed.
</P>
<P>
   The offenses documented by Kenneth Starr and put in the most
damning context possible by the Judiciary Committee do not rise in
magnitude to the constitutional standard for removal from office.
Clinton's misconduct merits stern, formal censure but is not
sufficiently damaging to the interests of the state to merit
overturning an election.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to get mired in the witness wrangle and allowing a
week or so for opening presentations from each side, the senate
leadership can buy some time. That will set the stage for a test
vote on some procedural question or, ideally, on a motion to
adjourn the trial and move to consideration of censure. Such
balloting would show that the 67 votes needed for removal do not
exist, and it would eventually produce the simple majority needed
to write a proportionate punishment for Clinton into the nation's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Neither a lengthy trial nor another rendition of the same dismal
testimony will add to Clinton's disgrace. Both the American system
and public patience are strong enough to stand two more years of
the disappointments stemming from this president's failings. But
the public wants and needs a demonstration that even when the White
House is shaken, the Senate has the stability to behave
responsibly. A fair, expeditious proceeding producing the obviously
called-for censure is the way to send that reassurance.

DON'T BE SHOCKED, BUT MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING

Jeffrey Nesteruk is an associate professor at Franklin &AMP; Marshall
College in Lancaster, Pa. 
(af) 
 By JEFFREY NESTERUK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've never wanted to make a lot of money. Though I knew that
early on, I've seldom stated it so boldly.
</P>
<P>
   It is a view best kept out of polite conversation in many of my
professional circles, where the talk flows easily around the
intricacies of mutual funds, stock market trends and financial
planners. Raise a question about the larger value of money _ say,
about its connection with the good life _ and the conversation
stops. It is as if you have broken an unspoken code, or branded
yourself an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   I've gone from being a corporate lawyer to a business school
faculty member to a liberal arts professor. Each move has involved
a significant drop in income and a significant increase in personal
satisfaction and well-being. As I'm getting poorer, life is getting
better.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I'm not really poor. My income is well above the
mean. I've never gone hungry, worried about making a rent or
mortgage payment, lacked a doctor when ill. When my friend tells
me, ``You're a professor; everyone earns more than you,'' he
clearly is using a highly circumscribed sense of ``everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, my friend and I are Ivy League graduates and lawyers.
Our crowd is filled with doctors, business executives, investment
bankers and prominent politicians. ``Everyone'' here is a rarefied
group.
</P>
<P>
   But the ideas of this group are more and more the ideas of
popular culture, too. More people are in the stock market than ever
before. Locker-room talk is as much about the Dow as it is about
batting averages. Financial gurus have attained pop-idol status. It
is now the words of Alan Greenspan, not those of Bob Dylan, that
are analyzed for hidden meanings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of this makes it harder to explain myself to others. In our
market-crazed culture, the choice of a less materialistic life
style appears moralistic. But morality has little to do with my
choices, if one sees morality as involving grudging sacrifice for
the sake of others.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up, I remember that my brother had a passion for skiing
and that I had a passion for reading. He spent many hours working
in after-school jobs to buy the latest in skiing equipment. I got a
card at the town library. If there was nobility in our choices, it
was laced liberally with the self-indulgence of adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, when I see people crowding into the latest not-to-be
missed _ yet inevitably high-priced _ restaurant, I find myself
wondering about their motives. How much of their passion is about
the food? And how much about status and self-image? My wife-to-be
and I both have careers that take us to four-star restaurants. But
given the chance for personal indulgence, we opt for pizza and beer
while stretched out on the rug in the den.
</P>
<P>
   It all reminds me of my Uncle Bill. Many years ago, he told me
that he had developed a taste for cheap cigars. The health risks of
smoking aside, I remember thinking how cool it was that he could
get so much pleasure at so little cost, even though he could afford
better.
</P>
<P>
   Our personal sense of wealth depends as much on our role as
consumers as it does on our role as producers. You have more when
you need less. Lawyers encounter a fair amount of tragedy in their
jobs, and one all-too-familiar example is the client whose salary
is in the high six figures, yet is having trouble getting by. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental problem is the way we try to do externally what
we need to do internally. We go shopping instead of dealing with
our loneliness. We ask for a raise instead of grappling with our
lack of self-worth.
</P>
<P>
   As Aristotle noted long ago, our preferences flow from our
character. Those with better characters will make better choices.
An overly commercialized culture misses that its first job is not
satisfying choices; it is developing character.
</P>
<P>
   Money, I've heard people say, is freedom. The more you earn, the
more possibilities are open to you. But there also is a kind of
freedom that comes when what you do is more than a market exchange.
Success in such work cannot be measured in profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I feel success daily _ in the class that goes well, in the
article that provokes a response, in the student who stops by my
office to tell me that I've made a difference. I may not be making
good money, but I hope that I'm making an investment of greater
value.
</P>
<P>
   At least I think that's what Uncle Bill would say. &QL;

   The Senate met again in the afternoon, with 96-year-old Sen.
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., presiding. Reading from a script, he swore
in Rehnquist, dressed in a black robe, as the presiding officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you solemnly swear that in all things pertaining to the
trial of the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, now pending,
that you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution
and laws, so help you God?'' Thurmond asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' the justice answered.
</P>
<P>
   Off the floor and away from the ceremony, Republicans and
Democrats remained sharply divided over what would happen next,
With House prosecutors insistent that they want to call anywhere
from five to 15 witnesses, Senate Republicans prepared a plan that
would allot the House prosecutors and White House lawyers each
three to five days to make their cases.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, each side would have to present the case for any
witness they want to call, and each witness would have to be
approved by a majority vote of the Senate. Lott said the trial
would end with a vote on the articles of impeachment by Feb. 5-12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's have the presentations, the opening statements, the
evidence, and the House explain why they might need this particular
witness to clarify this particular fact, or the White House, then
let the Senate consider that and vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans have expressed a desire to call such witnesses
as Monica Lewinsky, a prospect that some senators dread because the
testimony could dissolve into the details of her affair with
Clinton. At a news conference on Thursday, Lott rebuffed questions
about some senators' reservations over calling witnesses like Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really would rather not start down a list of witnesses that
may or may not even be requested when the time comes,'' Lott said.
``I don't know how that witness _ what that one or any other one
would testify to. I'd want to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they were adamantly opposed to hearing from
witnesses, particularly because it is believed that the Senate will
never be able to muster the 67 votes needed to remove Clinton from
office. The Senate has 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be a prescription for a never-ending saga if we go to
witnesses,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ``The House didn't have
witnesses. They said they didn't have time because they were in a
hurry. Well, we're busy, too. I don't need a witness to tell if
this is a blue dress or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., accused the Senate Republicans of being
overly solicitous of the House Republicans. ``They're concerned
about the House,'' he said. ``The Senate's supposed to write the
rules. Henry Hyde's a fine human being, but frankly I don't give a
damn what he thinks about what our rules are going to be. He
doesn't have a vote here.''

   Walk inside Perry Kinney's den and you almost expect to be
greeted by a tour guide from Universal Studios. In the room is the
air-powered skateboard that Michael J. Fox rode in ``Back to the
Future II,'' and the plexiglass skin-scraping chamber used to get
DNA samples in ``Gattaca,'' a 1997 thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Shavings from someone's epidermis still lie in the bottom of the
chamber, a detail that makes Kinney chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spent anywhere from $10,000 to $15,000 for props in
movies,'' said Kinney, 38, a social worker in Marysville, Wash. ``I
have spent 20 years at work dealing with other people's problems.
Collecting was a way for me to escape all that.''
</P>
<P>
   After being dismissed for years as the pastime of eccentrics,
the collection of Hollywood memorabilia has become a lucrative
mainstream business, dealers say. While sales figures for movie and
celebrity-owned items alone are not available, Unity Marketing, a
research firm in Stevens, Pa., estimates that retail sales of
``collectibles'' _ dolls, figurines, plates and other items made
for the sole purpose of being collected _ swelled to about $10
billion in 1997, up from $6.6 billion four years earlier. (That
tally does not include celebrity memorabilia, which are sold
primarily in private auctions and estate sales, or stamps and
coins.)
</P>
<P>
   Dealers say two forces are behind the collecting boom. Aging
baby boomers, primarily in their 40s and with money to spare, long
to relive their youth _ and they find a bit of it by buying a prop
or trinket from a favorite film.
</P>
<P>
   But what has really made the market flourish is the Internet.
Collectors used to search auction houses for months for rare items
that can now be found in minutes on line. A survey by Unity
Marketing of 1,800 collectors late last year showed that 36 percent
had used the Internet to add to their wares, up from 8 percent in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Little money is needed to get started. Elizabeth Taylor's
rainbow-colored hair band, for example, can be yours for just $35
from the Norma's Jeans catalogue in Chevy Chase, Md. A handkerchief
once owned by Lucille Ball costs $30.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Mannies, a district sales representative with
Kimberly-Clark in Atlanta, bought her first pair of celebrity
shoes, which had belonged to George Burns, for $175 five years ago.
Included in her 25-pair collection are shoes of Ms. Taylor and Pete
Rose. ``I guess I have spent around $7,000 on my collection,'' Ms.
Mannies said. ``But it's fun. I have them displayed on podiums
around my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Dealers warn, though, that collecting can be risky. Collectors
must be leery of fakes, and to make sure they get the real McCoy
must count on a handful of established dealers. Intrinsic value is
often impossible to determine _ and market value can bob up and
down along with a star's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The most cherished items, of course, once belonged to
superstars. Their cuff links or even their soiled undershirts can
easily be worth 40 times original value, dealers say.
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't just the memorabilia of Hollywood stars that can
command top prices. A set of John F. Kennedy's golf clubs sold for
$722,500 _ or 858 times the original estimate at Sotheby's _ at an
auction of items from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' estate in 1996.
Evening gowns once worn by Diana, Princess of Wales, sold for about
$41,000 each in a sale at Christie's in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Factors besides public adulation can increase the value of a
star's belongings. It helps to be dead, dealers say, and to have
left behind a paucity of personal items.
</P>
<P>
   These criteria have won some unlikely personalities top billing
at auctions. Anything owned by Walt Disney, Howard Hughes or Clara
Bow usually commands a high premium; the value soars if the article
can be connected to two of those celebrities. Norma's Jeans, for
example, is asking $9,000 for a sterling silver cigarette case
given to Disney by Howard Hughes, more than 17 times the typical
price tag for a case owned by a Hollywood luminary.
</P>
<P>
   For a sure winner, dealers suggest buying anything even remotely
connected with Marilyn Monroe, the bluest chip of the market. A
letter from Ms. Monroe, born Norma Jean Mortenson, to her guardian
recently went for more than $43,000 at Sotheby's. And her sterling
silver cigarette case costs $9,500 at Norma's Jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monroe is popular with men because they want to protect her,
but at the same time they lust after her,'' said Richard L. Wilson,
the owner of Norma's Jeans. ``But women like her, too. They
identify with her pain and struggle.''

REPORTS OF U.S. SPYING DIM OUTLOOK FOR IRAQ INSPECTIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (with IRAQ-INSPECT) 
(bl) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Reports that the United States used the U.N.
weapons inspectors in Iraq as cover for spying on President Saddam
Hussein are dimming any chances that the inspection system will
survive and that its head, Richard Butler, will remain in his job
much longer, officials and diplomats here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials expressed concern that the uproar over the spying
reports could jeopardize other U.N. disarmament operations or could
rekindle suspicions of some member nations about U.S. intentions
within the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a spokesman for Secretary-General Kofi Annan tempered
the statements of Wednesday that Annan had heard nothing but
``rumors'' about extensive U.S. spying, including activities aimed
at weakening Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these allegations are true,'' the spokesman, Fred Eckhard,
said, ``it would be damaging to the U.N. disarmament efforts
worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, Butler, an
Australian, said he was thinking of leaving the job when his
contract expires in June. ``I have always said I don't want this
job forever,'' he told the paper.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since its creation, the Special Commission has been unlike any
other U.N. program. It reports directly to the Security Council,
not the secretary- general, who formally appoints its executive
chairman but only in consultation with the council.
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1991, UNSCOM had no budget within the U.N. system,
but existed on handouts, especially from Washington, until two
years ago. When the Iraqi oil-for-food program finally began, money
was set aside from oil sales for perpetual weapons monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   From its inception, the commission _ originally a 21-member
panel of experts without a permanent staff _ has been an
intelligence-gathering operation as well as a disarmament agency.
</P>
<P>
   Its experts are not international bureaucrats, but arms
specialists and scientists on loan from dozens of countries. A very
small permanent headquarters staff is augmented periodically and
temporarily with inspectors recruited from more than 40 nations,
which also provide the extremely sophisticated surveillance
equipment and aircraft used for monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Teams vary in size, depending on the job at hand. It has always
been widely assumed that some of the inspectors had backgrounds in
intelligence. Some were drawn from special forces units of national
armies, departments of government or occasionally private
contractors like ground radar experts.
</P>
<P>
   The commission had no means of checking the experts on loan and
no special reason to do so, because its function was to ferret out
information Iraq that was unwilling to give voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll ask a country to provide three linguists, for example,''
said Charles Duelfer, an American who is deputy executive chairman
of the commission. ``We don't say where they should come from. We
don't care. Their job is to provide good technical translation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we ask for nonproliferation people, where do they come
from? The Red Cross doesn't have chemical weapons experts.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission seethed with intrigue from the start, as
countries that sided with Iraq expected their experts to influence
the work, usually with little success. Advance warnings of
inspections were initially passed on to Iraqi, apparently by
Russians, before the leaks were found and procedures changed,
commission officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Russia and France added ``political advisers'' to the
permanent staff. Citizens of other nations said they advisers had
been placed there to monitor and influence activity.
</P>
<P>
   The most intense pressure on Butler has come from Russia, a
commission official said. Many of his decisions have been
criticized by the Russians and the Chinese because they were not
consulted.
</P>
<P>
   The work of the commission, which began in 1991 with extensive
destruction of ammunition and weapons, evolved, and with that
evolution new problems arose.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, Duelfer and Rolf Ekeus, a Swedish diplomat who was the
first executive chairman, agree that 1995 was a turning point. That
year information that emerged after the defection to Jordan of
Saddam's son-in-law, Hussein Kamal, showed the extent to which Iraq
had been lying to the inspectors about its nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons programs, as well as missile projects.
</P>
<P>
   The commission responded by asking nations to upgrade
surveillance equipment and by establishing a unit led by a Russian
and a Briton to deal with Iraqi concealment. New inspections were
created to try to outwit the concealment attempts, especially
moving weapons and components around continuously.
</P>
<P>
   Ekeus said in an interview Wednesday that he realized that the
anticoncealment effort could lead to friction because the Special
Republican Guards and other elite troops in charge of moving the
weapons also guarded Saddam. Spying on one activity could lead to
charges of spying on Saddam, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Butler succeeded Ekeus in July 1997, and by that fall Butler had
his first big test of Iraqi noncooperation. At that point, some
Security Council members _ and for differing reasons _ began to
question what more there was to learn from Iraq. Led by Russia and
France, the critics began to press for an end to active disarmament
and a switch to a long-term monitoring and surveillance of Iraq,
with only occasional inspections. That would be accompanied by a
lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Iraq demonstrated that it was unlikely to allow any
intrusive inspections like those of the past. That defiance
snowballed into a total break with the Special Commission in
October. Inspectors were allowed back in November. But the Iraqis
obstructed their work, and the confrontation ended in U.S. and
British air strikes in December.
</P>
<P>
   After the attacks, Iraq, which has always accused the United
States of spying, said it would not allow UNSCOM to return unless
it had a new leader and structure. This week the Iraqis said that
no inspections of any kind would be allowed again.

GHOSTS OF THE PAST EVIDENT DURING SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF
CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The number of senators has almost doubled since the
last time the chamber conducted an impeachment trial of a
president.
</P>
<P>
   The styles have changed as well from 1868, when women spectators
showed up in bonnets and men in long suit coats to witness the
trial of President Andrew Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, when the gavel fell to begin only the second such
drama in U.S. history, the ghosts of the past were evident as
senators walked through a ritual quaintly archaic in rhetoric and
rigidly formal in procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to keep
silent, on pain of imprisonment,'' intoned the Sergeant at Arms Jim
Ziglar as he warned senators that the proceedings were about to
commence.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable feat, the 100 often loquacious politicians
stifled their inclination to deliver speeches or huddle with their
neighbors during the formal ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   They listened as the chamber's eldest member, 96-year-old Sen.
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., announced the entry of the 13 House
managers, all Republican men picked by the House GOP majority to
try the case against the Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   The members sat stoically as House delegation's leader, Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., hunched over the microphone to recite the two
articles of impeachment regarding perjury and obstruction of
justice against William Jefferson Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And several hours later they returned to escort the black-robed
Chief Justice of the United States, William Rehnquist, into the
ornate chamber to administer the oath to the senators who swore to
do ``impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws.''
</P>
<P>
   While the opening day was high on decorum and low on the kind of
open rancor that marked the House impeachment proceedings,
underlying tensions were evident.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the hallways Democrats voiced their frustration with
Republican efforts to conduct a prolonged trial with possible
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Even Republicans appeared unsure of how to proceed, clearly
aware that a protracted trial could be perilous to their own
political future as polls show the public increasingly disgusted
with ongoing attention to the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat, Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, summed up the
general distaste for the task now in front of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like passing a kidney stone through the body politic,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Senators meeting 130 years ago probably did not have to worry as
much about voter backlash because they were selected by their state
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   But much like the Johnson impeachment trial, the current debate
is being driven by long-festering cultural and political divisions
in society.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a Southern Democrat, was targeted by Northern
Republicans angry that he had not aggressively pushed
reconstruction policies in the defeated Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   He was impeached after he fired Secretary of War Edwin Stanton,
a violation of a law that barred the president from dismissing a
government official who has been appointed with congressional
advice and consent.
</P>
<P>
   After 37 days of hearings, the Senate fell one vote shy of
mustering the two-thirds necessary to impeach the president. The
vote was 35-19.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has long been the target of conservatives who believe
his personal behavior in a number of areas reflects the permissive
attitudes of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The specific impeachment charges stem from the president's
affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and his attempts to
cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the efforts to oust him, Clinton and his aides worked
hard Thursday to present an image of a president sticking to his
routine.
</P>
<P>
   The president spent the morning in the White House residence
exercising and working at home until noon, aides said. Spokesman
Joe Lockhart said the president did not view the Senate ceremony on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Later Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, joined by first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and 200 educators and elected officials,
announced an expansion of their plan for after-school programs to
serve 1 million students.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's confrontation with the Senate was more contentious
than Clinton's has been so far, with senators demanding he show up
to answer the charges. The president refused and dispatched his
lawyers instead.
</P>
<P>
   While impeachment dominated the newspapers then and now, the
advent of the electronic media, the more recent arrival of the
round-the-clock news programs and the need for material in
late-night comedy monologues has made the Clinton saga harder to
avoid.
</P>
<P>
   In Johnson's time _ and now _ the impeachment drama has drawn
spectators to the Capitol eager to snatch up the few available
tickets for a seat in the balcony overlooking the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The precious tickets were all used today,'' began a March, 31,
1868, New York Times account of the Senate proceedings. The article
described how those in the galleries, ``buzzed their voices and
fluttered their ribbons and flirted their fans until the elegant
presiding officer of the Senate ... was forced to repeat his
warnings by the savage rap of his gavel.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the guests of senators and other spectators
appeared better behaved than their counterparts in the last
century.
</P>
<P>
   Many had lined up early in the dark, cold morning outside of the
Capitol in hopes of gaining entry to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of history,'' said Maria Montalud, 28, of
Albuquerque, N.M., who happened to be in the nation's capital on
business.
</P>
<P>
   While she was curious to see the proceedings, Montalud also made
it clear that she wants senators to come to a quick conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want this to be over with,'' she said. ``Clinton was an
idiot for doing what he did, and Republicans are taking it too far.
It's tough when you can't find a hero.''

 &HT;    Andersen gives Birds advantage
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons place-kicker Morten Andersen opened his 17th
season in the NFL with a league-record 25 game-winning field goals.
As Andersen prepares for Saturday's NFC divisional playoffs game
against San Francisco in the Georgia Dome _ only his sixth
appearance in the postseason _ that mark still stands.
</P>
<P>
   During Atlanta's magical season, Andersen's campaign has been
among his most subdued. He was fourth among NFC kickers with 120
points, converting 23 of 28 field-goal attempts and all but one of
his 52 extra points. None of those kicks, however, was a
game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't control the circumstances,'' Andersen said. ``All I
can control is my effort and what I do when I put my foot to the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Andersen's experience and success in late-game situations
gives the Falcons a decided advantage over the 49ers, who have Wade
Richey, a rookie from LSU, who hit 18 of 27 field-goal attempts
this season.
</P>
<P>
   This season was just the second in Andersen's four in Atlanta
that he hasn't won a game for the Falcons with his left foot. In
his first season with the Falcons in 1995, Andersen had three-game
winners. He didn't have any game-deciding kicks in 1996, but
Andersen kicked two in the closing seconds last year.
</P>
<P>
   Of Andersen's 25 career game-winners, six came against the
Falcons during his 13 years with the New Orleans Saints. Andersen
has beaten the 49ers three times, the last in December 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kick the ball the same way,'' Andersen said. ``That's the
attitude you've got to have going in. It's still an opportunity to
get three points for the team. Your mechanics are going to be the
same, even though the circumstances might be different. That
doesn't change the fact that you've got to prepare the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Andersen has hit nine of 11 field-goal attempts in five playoff
games, four of which came during his tenure with the Saints. In
Atlanta's 1995 NFC wild-card game against the Packers, Andersen
kicked field goals of 31 and 22 yards in the Falcons' 37-20 loss at
Lambeau Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I neutralize all the outside distractions that come with
playing in the playoffs,'' Andersen said. ``There are plenty of
distractions in the NFL as it is, so the more normal you can make
it and the less variables you have to deal with, the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've just got to worry about what you can control _ your own
ability, the way you prepare and what your mindset is. I think over
the years I've been able to do that, and it's afforded me some
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta had some success in its other special teams this season,
as well. Punter Dan Stryzinski finished last in the NFC in net
punting with a 36.6-yard average, but Atlanta was second in the NFL
in punt coverage, largely because of Stryzinski's hang time and
ability to aim for the sideline. Rookie Tim Dwight was second in
the NFC in kickoff returns, and he had a 93-yard return for a
touchdown on the opening kickoff of the Falcons' 51-23 blowout at
Carolina on Oct. 4.

 &HT;    Reeves able to fill holes

<P>
   ATLANTA _ OK, let's be honest about Dan Reeves. He didn't
discover penicillin. He never worked a miracle in his life. He's no
Houdini, nor even a Copperfield. I don't want to pick on a man when
he's not at his best. He looked a little wan at the podium, facing
the pack of news jackals. His voice was low and not at full pitch,
but you had to remember: This guy had been split apart and had his
heart put back together just a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   He has since been celebrated as coach of the year by The
Associated Press. The musty old AP, everybody's sports bible, like
word from the Vatican. It was amazing, two years in town with a
franchise like a leaky boat and here he was, coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion had to be, he took a bunch of sow's ears and
turned them into silk purses. Just like that (finger-snap here).
Well, I'll have you know there were a few guys who could play this
game before he got here. So let's check it out.
</P>
<P>
   On the offensive line, Bob Whitfield, Robbie Tobeck, Gene
Williams and, and, well, I guess you could throw in Adam Schreiber,
the long-distance snapper, were in place. And Terance Mathis, who
also plays offense. Most of the defensive line and two linebackers
were like a welcoming committee, Lester Archambeau, Travis Hall,
Chuck Smith, Jessie Tuggle and Cornelius Bennett. Both kickers,
Morten Andersen and Dan Stryzinski, had been here long enough to
get their names spelled right.
</P>
<P>
   So, what was there left for Dan Reeves to do? Pump up the ball
and say go get 'em? Well, let's take a closer look at the paper
team he came into and the Atlanta Falcons of now.
</P>
<P>
   In the draft, he took a chance on a big galoot from Kent State
and a tackle from San Diego State and patched up the right side of
the offensive line. Sometimes you want to strangle O.J. Santiago
when his hands turn to iron, but he and Ephraim Salaam are working
out. Reeves passed on Bert Emanuel and traded for Tony Martin, not
for his voice but the hands. He drafted Henri Crockett to finish
out the linebacking threesome. The whole defensive backfield had to
be remodeled, and he did lay out a bundle to Ray Buchanan, and
Eugene Robinson, William White and Ronnie Bradford, but for once
fans can watch the other team throw a pass and not gasp.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up Bob Christian for an encore in town, Shane Dronett,
Brian Kozlowski, Todd Kinchen, Esera Tuaolo, and I could go on, but
that gives you an idea of how well discount shopping can work. The
second draft brought in the daredevil from Iowa, Tim Dwight, a
bungee-jumping kind of kick returner.
</P>
<P>
   Let me tell you what Hayden Fry, his college coach, said about
him. ``He's the greatest competitor I've ever had in 45 years of
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   That brings us around to the two keys, Chris Chandler and Jamal
Anderson. Anderson was already here, a longshot drafted out of
Utah, but he had spent three years wasting away in an airborne
offense. He found his gear this year, and in Atlanta he's the
running back of the year. All that was made possible by the trade
for Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never have been around a quarterback who is more accurate,''
Reeves said, then made this confession: ``I had no idea he was as
good as he is.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the cupboard wasn't bare. But there were holes to be filled,
and Dan Reeves filled out the rest of the jigsaw puzzle, or the
Falcons would not be playing the San Francisco 49ers for a
championship tomorrow.

 &HT;    Tight coverage, blitz making a difference
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Falcons' pass defense was disastrous in the first
10 games of the season, when Atlanta gave up an average of 268.8
net passing yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers had two of the three highest totals, 387 yards in a
31-20 San Francisco win in San Franc isco, and 342 yards in a 31-19
Falcon win at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons allowed just 146.8 net yards over the next five
games before the Dolphins struck for 384 yards in Atlanta's 38-16
win in the last game of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta finished 21st in the league in pass defense, a vast
improvement over the no. 29 and No. 30 spots they held through the
first 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   The difference came in improved man-to-man and bump coverage,
chiefly from cornerbacks Ronnie Bradford and Michael Booker on one
side, as Ray Buchanan, the other corner, continued to play well.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons also blitzed more as the season went on, reducing
big plays. Fourteen of 21 passing plays of 30 or more yards came in
the first seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Continued blitz
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will likely continue their increased blitz ratio,
chiefly with linebackers Jessie Tuggle and Cornelius Bennett.
Generally speaking, Atlanta has two kinds of blitz _ one where a
single blitzer will rush in an attempt to disrupt, or blow up a
play, and then zone blitzes or multi-blitzer packages where the
goal is a sack.
</P>
<P>
   More on the blitz
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' sack total dropped from a franchise-record 55 last
year to 38 in part because of reduced blitzes early in the season,
and because more teams threw quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Etc....
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons zone blitz, right end Chuck Smith and right
tackle Shane Dronett most frequently are the lineman to drop into
coverage.... Atlanta has had success with a stunt that sends left
end Lester Archambeau inside while left tackle Travis Hall
(6-foot-5, 300 pounds), drives his man _ 6-7, 330-pound guard Kevin
Gogan _ outside.

 &HT;    Falcon in flight
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ever since Ray Buchanan grooved to Run DMC in high
school, there was something different about the smallish boy who
would grow up to be a big-time Falcons cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   He always got into the sound, the rhythm, the beat, as much as
the words. These days, given the spiritual theme of his life, he
can do without the not-so-savory lyrics he listened to as a
teen-ager in Maywood, Ill., just west of Chicago, where he
preferred the White Sox over the Cubs
</P>
<P>
   But he can't stay away from the vibe.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan and his best friend, Cincinnati defensive back Ashley
Ambrose, made their first song last year on an NFL Jams CD. After
he plays in the Pro Bowl next month, they want to make an album _
weaving his spirituality into tunes with a rap and/or
rhythm-and-blues beat.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan looks the part, too, in expensive athletic warmups,
triple-digit footwear, subtle jewelry and blue-tinted glasses. ``I
take pride in my appearance,'' Buchanan said. ``You can say I'm a
smooth operator, but I'm the same person I was in college (at
Louisville), when I had to scrape by. I wore blue jeans in the
winter and made them into cut-offs in the summer. It's just that
now I can just afford nicer things.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan signed a four-year, $13 million contract with the
Falcons less than six weeks after Dan Reeves was hired as coach in
December 1997 and a week after the team traded for quarterback
Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   The money allows him to drive a Mercedes-Benz 500S, although
it's usually reserved for outings with his wife, Sheree, daughter
Destinee, 6, son Ray Jr., 5, and seven-month-old daughter, Baylen.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a Mercedes-Benz SL convertible, a Suburban sports
utility vehicle and a shiny black Jaguar XJ8 convertible, his
latest acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   But chances are that if Buchanan is not playing football, he's
in the theater in his spacious home at the Country Club of the
South in Alpharetta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love movies,'' he said, ``whether my wife and I go out to
the theater or downstairs. It's my quiet space, even with my kids
there.''
</P>
<P>
   When Buchanan is not sitting in front of his 140-inch screen,
complete with a fancy projector, reclining seats and every
satellite dish and digital video setup known to man, he's probably
playing video games with the kids. Or maybe he's golfing with
teammates or going to dinner with his wife, whom he met as a
freshman at Louisville. A safety at Louisville, Buchanan was a
third-round draft choice of the Colts in 1993. Even though the
Colts tabbed him as their transition player, Reeves targeted him as
the first step toward improving a dreadful Falcons secondary.
</P>
<P>
   This season, he tied for the NFC lead with seven interceptions
while leading the Falcons with 17 pass defenses -- almost all while
covering the opposing team's best receiver. He also finished with
73 total tackles, and his 56 first hits were third.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done everything we wanted when we talked about signing
him, including move here,'' Reeves said. ``He's a great player, and
a great person. You can talk to Ray; he's open to coaching, not a
guy who knows it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's father, Richard, and mother, Julia, influenced him.
``My dad was the disciplinarian. My mom was the gentle one,'' he
said. ``She's the one who planted the seed about coming to know
Christ and go to church. She was the one who always hugged me after
I got a whipping from my dad. All that helped me become a man, a
person who can handle responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Another new Falcon, free safety Eugene Robinson, knows how much
Buchanan means to the Falcons pass defense, which improved
dramatically during the last half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to do more blitzing,'' Robinson said,
``because of the personnel we have, with Ray back there locked up
on one man.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-9, 198-pound Buchanan has very quick feet, and bigger
receivers can't knock him out of coverage by bumping his hips
because Buchanan's hips and legs are so strong.
</P>
<P>
   So is his love for music.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose, a teammate in Indianapolis, will be in town for
Saturday's playoff game against San Francisco. The two also plan to
entertain at Super Bowl parties in Miami. They plan to begin work
on their own recordings next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ashley and I hang on to each other like brothers,'' said
Buchanan, who also has two younger brothers, Ryan, 26 and Robert,
13. ``We used to rap all the time and entertain people. We want to
make an album with more inspirational theme. We'll intertwine
spiritual music, and even love songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to do it ourselves, but options have popped up.
Since we been winning, so many people want to be a part of it. I
have opportunities now that I'm blessed to have, and I want to take
advantage of them.''

 &HT;    Dogged 49ers expect the best
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ The question almost stumped Jerry Rice.
He's been around long enough to have heard them all, but this one
at least surprised the 49ers' talented receiver. He pondered it a
moment, shifted his eyes, licked his lips and then revealed a sly
smile, which indicated either that he knew the answer or couldn't
believe the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's it like to go to Atlanta, a team you guys have
dominated during the years, as the underdog?''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed as if that last word _ ``underdog'' _ insulted Rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said, ``you have to respect Atlanta. They're
playing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   That was it, except for another sly, knowing smile. Rice's
demeanor suggested confidence, that those who are predicting San
Francisco's imminent demise have another thing coming.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the 49ers have a quiet self-assuredness about them as they
come into the Georgia Dome on Saturday in the unfamiliar position
of underdog. Before this season, San Francisco had won 10 of the
previous 12 games against the Falcons by a combined score of
460-194. They have owned the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, they've taken on a ``nobody believes in us
mentality,'' one that seemingly has brought together a talented
team that never quite hit a consistent stride in the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to win,'' coach Steve Mariucci said. ``As we go
through the ups and downs of a season, we learn to rely on each
other. We learned to be a team. We win and lose together as a team.
We've become more confident in each other. We always talk about
chemistry. We have a good chemistry. The mood in the locker room is
good.''
</P>
<P>
   It was evident this week. The Niners seemed relaxed. On Tuesday,
Rice had an emotional display that could have been perceived as
tightness, when he confronted long-time San Francisco Chronicle
columnist Glenn Dickey with an expletive-filled locker room tirade
that embarrassed everyone who witnessed it.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey had written a column suggesting that the Niners should
consider trading Rice before next season, and it apparently did not
sit well with Rice.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Rice apologize for the outburst, claiming that he
had been ``joking.'' He addressed the media for several minutes,
and 49ers beat writers said it was the most accommodating he had
been in months.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Rice finished, affable and personable running back
Terry Kirby made certain that the mood of the team remained light.
He held court for 15 minutes or so, at first joking about Rice and
then comically chastising the assemblage about everything including
weigh, attire and drinking habits.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby had the entire room laughing, with other players joining
the fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see,'' defensive back Merton Hanks said, ``the guys
are loose. We're a veteran team. Nobody expects us to win. We
weren't even supposed to beat the Packers, if you go by some
people. But we're here. We're cool.''
</P>
<P>
   To a man, the 49ers believe their vast playoff experience has
benefited them in preparing for a big game after a draining Green
Bay victory in a short week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sore,'' offensive lineman Ray Brown said. ``It's like it's
a day ahead of schedule. But I'll be all right. I have to be. I'm
not having a pity party for anyone. And no one's having one for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the attitude: Do what it takes to get the job
accomplished, no matter what the circumstances. San Francisco has
played just one short-week playoff game in its history; the Niners
lost in 1996 in Green Bay, 35-14.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can quote all the stats you want,'' veteran safety Tim
McDonald said, ``but it's about going out to Atlanta and playing.
We had a short week, and that might help them. But they've been
off, and we played, so we're in a rhythm. You can look at it any
way you want. But it's about who plays better.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers believe they have not played their best ball but that
they are approaching high gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best we've played all year,'' Ken Norton Jr. said.
``We want this to be a very special season. We have to give the
same effort we did against Green Bay, and a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   The last-second victory against Green Bay has the team thinking
great things: ``We can't be stopped now,'' Terrell Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   But McDonald offered some perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to validate what we did (against Green Bay) is to
go into Atlanta and come away with a win,'' he said. ``We cleared
one obstacle, but now we hit the road.''

 &HT;    Talented Stokes may be overlooked
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Jerry Rice is a playing legend and Terrell
Owens seems on his way to stardom. That leaves J.J. Stokes, the
third receiver of the lethal San Francisco trio, as a player who
could turn Saturday's game against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He had a quiet 65-catch season for 770 yards and eight
touchdowns. But he opened the season with 11 receptions for 111
yards and two touchdowns against the Jets. That game showed his
potential, but his production dropped in the remaining 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to put my ego behind us,'' said Stokes, a 1995
first-round draft pick out of UCLA. ``I talked all year about
getting the ball more, but right now it's about getting it done.
Now, we have another chance Saturday in Atlanta to make a big
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Down, not out
</P>
<P>
   Although slowed with knee trouble, Rice bears close watching. He
excels in the playoffs. He holds seven NFL postseason records,
including most receptions (121), receiving yards (1,748), 100-yard
games (7) and touchdowns (18).
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, when I'm on the field in a game, I'm able to block
out the pain,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not practice all week but did rehab work to strengthen
the muscles around the knee, he said. ``It's the playoffs, and I
want to go out there and have fun,'' he said. ``But it's different
this year (with the pain).''
</P>
<P>
   He said he does not expect to have to undergo surgery in the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Riding high
</P>
<P>
   Owens said he still was riding high off his game-winning
touchdown catch against the Packers. ``Slowly but surely, I'm
coming down,'' he said. ``It's kind of hard to take that picture
out of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Catch and run
</P>
<P>
   In the renowned ``West Coast Offense,'' yardage after the catch
is significant. Rice was the team leader in that department in the
regular season with 475 yards and five touchdowns. Owens had 407
yards and eight scores and Stokes 180 yards and three touchdowns.

 &HT;    Texas astronomer sayd Plains Indians were astronomically
literate
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's long been an open question whether American Indians,
particularly the Plains Indians, were astronomically literate,
since most were nomadic and they left few artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Now University of Texas astronomer Robert Robbins has found the
first tentative evidence that at least some of them were aware of
the seasonal solstices _ the beginning of summer on June 21, and of
winter on Dec. 22 _ shown by the sun's height in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is ``sun daggers,'' natural V-shaped illuminations
on rock paintings on a limestone bluff near the Concho River in
West Texas. The daggers appear at midday, only at the winter and
summer solstices, when the sun shines through a natural slot
between two nearby boulders.
</P>
<P>
   The winter dagger is the most impressive. For about an hour on
Dec. 22, when the sun is at its lowest point in the sky, the
dagger's tip points to the center of a painting of a red shield. A
legend passed down by the family that has owned the land since the
1870s describes the shield as a symbol of a meeting between five
tribes to divide hunting lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems pretty clear that the dagger was noticed and the
shield was added later,'' Robbins said in presenting his findings
this week at the 193rd national meeting of the American
Astronomical Society in Austin. ``They paid attention, saw this was
how it goes, and put the painting on it and formalized it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Indians known to have used the area (first the
Tonkawa and Jumano, later the Apache, Kiowa and Commanche)
apparently had a higher degree of calendar-making skill than
generally believed.
</P>
<P>
   Sun daggers themselves are not unusual. They have been found
illuminating rock paintings and monuments elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows the age of the West Texas shield painting, which is
about 1-foot square, but Robbins said other studies have found
evidence of 6,000 years of habitation in the area, near the small
town of Paint Rock, east of San Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins discovered the dagger phenomenon when land owners Fred
and Kay Campbell told a friend, who happened to be on the board of
visitors of UT's McDonald Observatory, about a curious play of
sunlight on the rock paintings that form a mural almost a mile long
on the 30-foot high bluff.
</P>
<P>
   The friend called Robbins who called the Campbells and suggested
checking the illuminations at the winter solstice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure enough,'' said Kay Campbell, ``I went down there at the
winter solstice in 1996, and I just found it. It really is awesome.
It just takes the breath away when you see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists long ignored West Texas rock art, most of it
found under bluffs that can be approached on foot, because dating
it proved impossible by standard methods.
</P>
<P>
   But a new technique developed at Texas A&AMP;M University is
increasingly accepted as definitive. It has dated rock paintings
along the Pecos River in West Texas from 3,000 to 4,000 years old _
the oldest known in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Some anthropologists regard the Texas rock art, some of it
interpreted as shamans undertaking spiritual journeys, as the
earliest manifestation of organized religion in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins figured his winter solstice find would be less likely to
be a coincidence if he could find a summer solstice sun dagger on
the mural near Paint Rock.
</P>
<P>
   But the mural is so long that it would take a busload of
researchers to be sure. So Robbins used mythology, recalling the
turtle pictograph commonly used in ancient Mexican cultures to
represent the sun.
</P>
<P>
   He found a turtle on the mural and, on June 21 last year, at the
summer solstice _ when the sun is at its highest point in the sky _
he photographed sun daggers on the bluff above and below the
turtle. Robbins plans more research on the mural.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something to think these people could figure out how to
do all that,'' Kay Campbell said. ``There may be more down there.
This is kind of opening the door.''

GO TEAM! AND OTHER FAMILIAR CHEERS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn.)  (af) 
 By DEBORAH STEAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What would our nation be without Minnesotans?
</P>
<P>
   Besides Post-it notes, the state has given us the sublimely
American town, Lake Wobegon; the spectacularly American
wrestler-turned-governor, Jesse Ventura, and the quintessentially
American businessman, Harvey Mackay.
</P>
<P>
   Mackay runs the $85 million Mackay Envelope Corp. in
Minneapolis. But he is best known for writing best-selling
inspirational business books like ``Swim With the Sharks Without
Being Eaten Alive'' and ``Dig Your Well Before You're Thirsty.''
</P>
<P>
   His latest book, ``Pushing the Envelope: All the Way to the
Top'' (Ballantine, $24.95), features a new metaphor, but sticks to
the old reliable sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Mackay preaches the gospel of self-improvement, hard
work, ingenuity and fair-but-fierce competition. And again the
message is delivered in short, homiletic chapters covering the
author's usual topics: the art of managing, selling and being a
leader.
</P>
<P>
   There is, as always, a heap of gumption in this extended pep
talk. A self-described aphorism junkie, Mackay can reel off lists
of inspirational sayings and breathless believe-it-or-not business
factoids. ``Henry Ford,'' he tells us more than once, ``failed and
went broke'' five times before he finally succeeded. Each of his
chapters also ends with what he calls a Mackay's Moral. (``You'll
never turn try into triumph without adding the umph!'')
</P>
<P>
   But the author, a peripatetic lecturer and columnist whose
business card still reads ``envelope salesman,'' also revels in the
sharp, practical side of his homespun philosophy. So for readers
willing to put up with the corn, there may be a few lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``American business success stories have not always consisted
solely of downsizings and restructurings,'' Mackay writes. ``There
are countless cases where smart people continue to sell and resell
the most mundane products and services year in and year out. They
win their customers by cleverly differentiating themselves from
their competition.''
</P>
<P>
   If trading on his own brand name helps his company do that these
days, he doesn't say so. His inside tip is this: Differentiating
yourself means sweating the small stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Mackay is a relentless detail man. He carries masking tape on
his speaking engagements to disable the metal latches that clang
when auditorium doors are opened and closed. And as he tells it, he
is always tracking the competition, surveying his customers for
ideas and interviewing his employees.
</P>
<P>
   If he is thinking about a merger, he checks up _ to put it
mildly _ on the chief executive in question. Once, pursuing a deal
with a West Coast envelope maker, he phoned one of the company
chief's former high school teachers for a chat about the
executive's character.
</P>
<P>
   If Mackay is meeting with Fidel Castro, he asks about the
commandant's bowling average. If he's speaking in Taipei, he goes
first to Berlitz to learn a winning smattering of Mandarin Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Such lessons aren't for everyone, of course. They're perhaps
best absorbed by managers of small to midsized companies who happen
to be on the international speakers' circuit.
</P>
<P>
   In giving advice to the rest of us _ and if his book-jacket
blurbs in the past are any guide, that includes Ted Koppel, Gloria
Steinem and Al Neuharth, the founder of USA Today _ Mackay offers
mostly warmed-over exhortations on determination and leadership. He
is at his best as a wily negotiating coach, teaching us how to
clinch a sale or close a deal. He even gives a short course on
saying no to a persistent salesman like him.
</P>
<P>
   And here's a bright spot: Despite its title and the occasional
sports metaphors, ``Pushing the Envelope'' is fairly free of
business buzzwords. (The ``envelope'' of the title phrase, a
test-pilot term popularized by Tom Wolfe in ``The Right Stuff,''
originally referred to an aircraft's performance limits.)
</P>
<P>
   Mackay says he likes to call a salesperson a salesperson, even
though, these days, we hear a lot about ``marketing engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   Plain talk and a relentlessly upbeat manner: The man's a model
Minnesotan. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FUN WITH JARGON
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of buzzwords, if you haven't yet learned to play the
surreptitious game that mocks managers who use bizspeak, it's not
too late.
</P>
<P>
   The game, played at work with a bingo-style card, is now in
``every nook and cranny of the corporate landscape,'' according to
``Buzzword Bingo: The Complete, Definitive Guide to the Underground
Workplace Game of Corporate Jargon and Doublespeak,'' by Lara Stein
and Benjamin Yoskovitz (Villard, $9.95).
</P>
<P>
   This handbook includes rules of play and a thoughtfully provided
set of bingo sheets imprinted with the dreaded phrases.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to use the grids at meetings, marking off the words
and terms as the boss utters them _ ``TQM,'' ``outsource,'' ``open
door policy'' and the like _ and to cough discreetly if you get
bingo first. A wickedly satisfying version involves trying to
elicit the required words from the speaker. A buzzword glossary,
itself quite amusing, is included.

OLBERMANN MAKES IMMEDIATE IMPACT AT FOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A day after Keith Olbermann welcomed viewers to
``the resuscitation of my career,'' the TV networks welcomed the
NBA to resuscitate its ratings.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, Fox Sports Net becomes the winner in a revival of
the fittest.
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann's leap back into the sports scores-and-highlights pool
as the co-anchor on three of the five Fox Sports News hour-long
shows (aired in different parts of the country) couldn't have been
timed much better.
</P>
<P>
   On his first night, Tuesday at the Century City studios,
Olbermann did what he termed on-air as a ``less than sanguine''
interview with NBA commissioner David Stern as the drop-dead
deadline for this season approached.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday's newscast, Olbermann and everyone else was
reporting on the labor agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann declined to take credit, although Stern gave him that
on Thursday's broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday's interview in light of the Thursday's
drop-deadline coming up, Olbermann asked Stern:
</P>
<P>
   ``So what do we (NBA followers) do?. Light candles, say
prayers?''
</P>
<P>
   Stern replied: ``Light a candle, and then remind yourself it's
better than what you had to do a year ago... it's not Monica
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Stern told Fox Sports News reporter Elisa Hart:
``Keith must have done it. Thank you for lighting that candle.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, thanks. From all of us.
</P>
<P>
   Back in business: The executives of Fox Sports Net's 15-strong
cable chain that includes Fox Sports West and Fox Sports West 2
were immediately relieved they didn't have to plug any more
programming holes this spring with more ``NBA Classics'' or
baseball All-Star Games from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, Fox Sports Net has the TV rights to 26 of the 29
NBA teams. The entire network lost more than 500 games. Locally,
both the Lakers and Clippers have cable deals with FSW and FSW2.
</P>
<P>
   As for specifics about ratings in the fourth quarter of '98 with
no NBA, Fox Sports Net chief Arthur Smith would only say ``we took
a hit,'' but it varied from market to market. Los Angeles, of
course, took an extreme hit losing a couple dozen Lakers home games
on FSW along with KCAL Channel 9's road games.
</P>
<P>
   ``With replacement programming, we did reasonably well, but you
can't compete with a Lakers game in Los Angeles,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike NBC and TNT, which have four-year deals with the league
totaling $1.9 billion and helped the NBA owners with some financial
cushioning during the dark schedule, Fox Sports Net's contracts
allow it to pay only for the games that take place.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, NBC Sports chief Dick Ebersol said advertisers were
lined up to buy spots on what turns out to be a not-so-abbreviated
national plate of games. Most of NBC's NBA programming is heavy in
the second half of the season and playoffs anyway.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will get first crack at regular-season weekend games to
telecast when talks begin today about NBC's and TNT's wants for the
revised schedule, which should have some structure by next week.
There will also be discussion about rebates at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Turner lost about 40 percent of its original schedule and hopes
to get 20 games back for this season. Of the 31 regular-season
dates NBC had already planned, Ebersol said he expects to have 27
or 28 weekend telecasts leading up to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate it's ending when it does because if it went
any longer, it really damaged our chances,'' said Ebersol.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the excitement of getting back to work, we're not
unaware of the fact we and Turner, with the league and players,
have a lot of work to win back the casual fan. There's no question
in my mind the real long-term fan (will) be back almost
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Now all Ebersol has to do is dispatch Ahmad Rashad to convince
Michael Jordan that a comeback would be really, really good at this
point.
</P>
<P>
   So will viewers come back? In a one-day poll Wednesday, ESPN.com
asked how fans felt about the upcoming NBA season and elicited an
astounding 80,000-plus voters _ 53.8 percent of which said they had
no interest at all and 27.7 percent saying they were mildly
interested.
</P>
<P>
   A similar poll on CNNSI.com had 43,000 voters (77 percent of
which said they don't care about the season), one on Foxsports.com
had 6,800 voters (75 percent don't care) while one on CBS
SportsLine attracted just 5,000 voters (69 percent said they'd
ignore the whole season).
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, ESPN.com asked how interest would be affected if
Michael Jordan returned, more than 50 percent of about 4,000 voters
said ``none whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olbermann factor: There is no fallacy to Fox Sports Net's
thinking it has brought itself up to realistically compete with
ESPN for the sports news viewer now.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Olbermann's former ESPN ``Big Show'' partner Dan
Patrick also did an interview with Stern. But when the union voted
to ratify the deal on Wednesday afternoon, Olbermann's Fox Sports
Net guys broke in live to interview union rep Billy Hunter. At the
same time, Patrick's ESPN was showing the World Firefighter
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it is the (begin ital)championships(end ital),'' said
Olbermann.
</P>
<P>
   The point is _ FSN has found an attitude adjustment, directly
related to the hiring of Olbermann and, to a somewhat lesser
degree, former ESPNer Chris Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to change the attitude _ this is not a studio
show we're doing but a live newscast,'' said John Nelson, who a
year-and-a-half ago left his job at the Associated Press after 25
years to become FSNews' managing editor and try to inject that
element. ``Right away, both Keith and Chris Myers have increased
the quality of journalism here, and you can see the young producers
and talent picking up on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Olbermann always had that approach, even when banging heads with
local producers at KTLA Channel 5 and KCBS Channel 2 to avoid
becoming a video-generated goofball to compete in the L.A. market
in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his first hour-long sportscast Tuesday, the 11
p.m. show for the East Coast, Olbermann told partner Kevin Frasier
that getting back into sports was ``like falling off a bike... you
never forget how.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of behind-the-scenes Monica Lewinsky-President Clinton
talk he had to trudge through at MSNBC, Olbermann was back talking
about the behind-the-back passes to Miami of Ohio basketball star
Wally Szczerbiak. And he was truly enjoying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as rusty as Randall Cunningham must have been in his first
exhibition game this year,'' said Olbermann, doing his first
sportscast since leaving ESPN in June of '97. ``I have this Whitey
Herzog fear. Remember when he left as the Cardinals general manager
and took time off and then was GM for the Angels? Then he traded
Dante Bichette for Dave Parker.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning, it's easy to get out of touch in a short time.
</P>
<P>
   There's also understandable pressure Olbermann could feel from
tremendous hype about his return _ how many sports guys get a
billboard on Sunset Boulevard, dasherboards at NHL arenas or an
entire MTA bus painted with their faces on it? &QL;

   WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
KXTA-AM (1150)'s new morning show. No trouble getting Dodgers
players as guests by adding Derrick Hall to the team with John
Ireland starting Monday. Hall nervously leaves his somewhat stable
(and well-paying) career in the Dodgers' publicity office after
more than six years to pursue what he says is his first love _
sports-talk radio _ starting Monday on the 6-to-9 a.m. shift.
``It's too enticing to pass up,'' said Hall, who was a broadcast
major once at Arizona State. &QL; 
Former 1150-AM drive-time host Joe McDonnell resurfaces on KABC-AM
(790) for a news-talk show Saturday from 7-to-10 p.m. ``This might
be the new direction in my life, who knows,'' said McDonnell, who
is also considering offers from all-news KFWB-AM as well as
all-sports shows in San Francisco and Dallas. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
The rest of KXTA-AM (1150)'s new lineup. Which isn't really new,
except the 1-to-3 p.m. slot previously brought to its knees by Karl
Malone and Vic Jacobs has been given to Ben Maller and Dave Smith
instead of Steve Edwards and Eric Tracy. The station wants to keep
Edwards and Tracy in the loop, but don't want to pay them enough to
be permanent hosts. With Maller and Smith moving upstream, the
station will run maybe its best choice of programming from
post-Ferrall to pre-morning show (10 p.m. to 6 a.m.). That would
be, of course, ESPN Radio.

 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In March, in a last-ditch attempt to uncover Saddam
Hussein's covert weapons and intelligence networks, the United
States used the U.N. inspection team to send an U.S. spy into
Baghdad to install a highly sophisticated electronic eavesdropping
system.
</P>
<P>
   The spy entered Iraq in the guise of a U.N. weapons inspector
and left the eavesdropping device behind.
</P>
<P>
   For nine months, the device let the United States and a select
elite within the U.N. inspection team monitor the cell phones,
walkie-talkies and other communications instruments used by the
military and intelligence officers who protect Saddam and conceal
Iraq's weapons.
</P>
<P>
   This operation, described Thursday by U.S. officials, is at the
center of the current furor over the relationship between U.S.
intelligence agents and inspectors with the U.N. Special
Commission, which is supposed to be independent and not pursue the
policy or intelligence goals of individual members.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials explained in some detail the origins of the
operation, making clear how U.S. intelligence came to dominate the
inspections in the months before the United States bombed Iraq. The
officials and others insisted that the eavesdropping operation was
not a unilateral, covert U.S. espionage gambit, and that it had the
blessing of Richard Butler, chairman of the commission, which is
known as UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not shock people that U.S. intelligence did
everything it could to help UNSCOM undermine'' Saddam, a senior
intelligence official said.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-five percent of what was overheard in Baghdad was
useless, another official said. But the rest led the weapons
inspectors to focus intensely on Iraq's hidden weapons programs and
security networks.
</P>
<P>
   That deep look inside Saddam's most precious military and
intelligence programs ended in December, when Baghdad expelled the
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, a four-day-long U.S.-led bombing campaign began.
Cruise missiles hit some targets selected from data gleaned by the
U.S.-led espionage, U.S. and U.N. officials said. But there is
little evidence that the bombing did permanent damage to Iraq's
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the officials spoke on the condition that they
would not be quoted directly. It appeared from their descriptions
that they believed the inspection team would never return to Iraq
in its original form.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors undertook their first electronic eavesdropping
three years ago. For the first two years, though it had some
success, its goal was frustrated by Iraqi security. In March it was
replaced by the U.S.-led effort.
</P>
<P>
   While some U.N. officials suspect that the effort was an U.S.
covert operation, U.S. officials insisted Thursday that a handful
of key UNSCOM officials approved the secret program.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the operation go back to 1995, after the
defection of an Iraqi general, Hussein Kamal. Kamal, a son-in-law
of Saddam, inexplicably returned to Iraq, apparently gripped by
remorse. He was promptly shot.
</P>
<P>
   But some aides who defected with him stayed out of Iraq. For the
past four years, they have provided the United States and UNSCOM
with a unique window into the Iraqi security apparatus, which had
successfully hidden Iraq's biological and chemical weapons programs
from the U.N. inspectors since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the United States and the United Nations
understood the depth and the sophistication of Iraqi security,
which includes thousands of officers commanded by the Special
Republican Guard, the Special Security Office and Saddam's personal
details. The most important target, they now understood, was a
sector of Iraq's Special Republican Guard known as the National
Monitoring Directorate.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was how to penetrate those networks.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. official said it was naive to assume that his
organization was innocent in espionage matters. ``The U.N. has been
and continues to be a focal point for espionage by everybody,'' he
said. Intelligence officers from most of the world's nations use
the organization as a base of operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rolf Ekeus, then the chairman of the U.N. inspections team,
needed help. He asked the United States to help him create a system
to listen in on the Iraqi security networks, many of which operated
at frequencies that U.S. spy planes and spy satellites could not
hear, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington did help, offering technology designed by the
National Security Agency and the CIA, which picked up Iraqi
telecommunications, beamed them to a computer in Bahrain and
filtered through the conversations for key words like ``missile''
or ``chemical.'' The information was shared with U.N. inspectors
and with other nations involved with the inspection effort _ though
not with Russia, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the CIA, several aspects of the program are
being withheld from publication to avoid assisting Iraqi
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout 1996 and 1997, the campaign was an international
effort, involving British, Israeli, Swedish, Polish and Australian
officers and officials, among others. The eavesdropping equipment
was brought into Iraq on each inspection mission, and used to
listen in as Iraqi security officers, speaking in code and using
scrambling devices, worked to conceal weapons and protect Saddam.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The U.S. officials said Ekeus did not want the effort to be
misread as a CIA operation, and that the United States did not take
the lead role, although ``we broke our backs to provide UNSCOM the
support it needed _ technology, equipment, people,'' as one said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, U.S. intelligence officials read everything gleaned
from the effort and distributed the intelligence to Pentagon
planners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we evaluate everything we got from UNSCOM? Of course,''
one said. U.S. spy agencies also interviewed inspectors
extensively, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, the commission had not succeeded in unmasking
Iraq's hidden programs. It was then, nine months ago, that the
United States inserted its sophisticated device into the U.N.
operation, and assumed the lead role in the espionage. It
restricted the information gathered to a very small circle of
senior U.N. inspection officials. They barred Scott Ritter, the
U.S. military officer who had led UNSCOM's earlier effort to unmask
Iraq's covert weaponry and whom they suspected as a security risk.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insisted that the information they gathered was
only what the commission needed _ insight into the ways in which
Iraq concealed its weapons. But they conceded that those very same
methods were used by Iraq to protect its president.
</P>
<P>
   It should be no surprise, they said, that U.S. cruise missiles
were aimed last month at the same people and institutions that the
eavesdropping campaign tried to penetrate _ including the home of
the man who runs the security organizations that protect Iraq's
secret weapons and Saddam Hussein.

 &HT;    Lawsuit over alleged Olympic kiosk fraud delayed
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Opening statements in a $6 million Olympics kiosks
lawsuit were delayed Thursday until Monday in Superior Court as
lawyers on both sides talked over aspects of the dispute, possibly
including a potential settlement. ``There are a variety of issues
being discussed,'' said Ed Garland, one of the defense attorneys.
Eleven people and corporations allege they paid at least $10,000
for each of dozens of souvenir booths, supplies and services, but
received nothing in return. Defendants include Creative Travel
Services, which also brought 3,000 teenagers from around the
country to work at the kiosks, but could neither feed nor house the
youths when they arrived.

EDITORIAL: AFTER KENDRA WEBDALE'S DEATH   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Jan. 8:
</P>
<P>
   Right now, New Yorkers are particularly conscious of the
problems of mentally ill people who are homeless or living without
proper supervision. A 29-year-old man with a long history of mental
illness has been charged with shoving Kendra Webdale of Manhattan
to her death under a subway train. It is the sort of event that
terrifies the millions of people who use the city subways
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, it is sparking a political debate about whether
Andrew Goldstein, Ms. Webdale's accused killer, was receiving the
necessary care, and whether some new law or program is needed to
prevent similar tragedies in the future.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers probably come into closer contact with unsupervised
mentally ill people than most Americans. They know from observation
what scientific research confirms _ that people who suffer from
mental illness are generally much more dangerous to themselves than
to anyone else. Goldstein may have been an exception. It is still
unclear whether the state's mental health system failed him in any
way.
</P>
<P>
   But we do know that there are large numbers of mentally ill
people living on the streets _ or, like Goldstein, in lonely rented
rooms _ who need more support than they are getting. Many are
candidates for supervised housing, where they can live in the
community while getting the help they need to manage their
illnesses. Since 1990, the state and city have created more than
3,800 units of supervised housing under a very successful program
called New York/New York, which is credited with moving 4,000
mentally ill New Yorkers off the streets. Last year the city and
state both authorized money for a follow-up initiative that would
be expanded to include both the mentally ill homeless and those who
are in danger of becoming so.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the program has gotten stalled because of
squabbles between the city and state. One particular sticking point
has been the state's refusal to cover the operational costs of the
program. Since mental health has historically been a state
responsibility, we believe the Pataki administration should change
its mind and shoulder the costs. Either way, the fight should
certainly not torpedo this useful and humane program.
</P>
<P>
   Modern medicine has made it far easier to control the symptoms
of mental illness, but many outpatients stop taking their
prescriptions because they dislike the side effects. It is unclear
whether Goldstein had abandoned his own medication. The state has
had some success in using the threat of forced hospitalization to
get cooperation from patients with a history of recalcitrance. It
may want to expand the program.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other options with potential for wider application
that also deserve debate, such as expanding state Medicaid coverage
to underwrite the cost of newer, more expensive anti-psychotic
drugs that do not have the drastic side effects that cause people
to stop taking the older generation of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Neither supervised housing nor better medicine will bring Kendra
Webdale back, and it is possible that no government initiative
could have averted her murder. But her senseless death can be given
meaning if it spurs the state to accept a broader responsibility
for the care of the mentally ill.

COUNTRY SINGER RODRIGUEZ INDICTED ON CHARGES OF MURDER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Johnny Rodriguez, the country singer whose
teetering music career has tumbled into a free fall, was indicted
Thursday on charges of murder.
</P>
<P>
   A Uvalde County grand jury alleges that the 47-year-old
Rodriguez intentionally caused the death of Israel Borrego, 26, who
was shot to death Aug. 29 while he was inside Rodriguez's mother's
Sabinal home some 60 miles west of here.
</P>
<P>
   Also indicted was Carlos Tovar, a friend of Rodriguez whose age
was not known.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe Mr. Borrego was an intruder in the Rodriguez
house the night he was shot,'' said Tony Hackebeil, the district
attorney for Uvalde County in south-central Texas. ``Obviously the
grand jury didn't believe that either.''
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Rodriguez could spend the rest of his life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   The case, which is expected to go to trial next summer, will
likely hinge on whether Borrego was an invited guest in the
Rodriguez house the morning he was shot. San Antonio lawyer Alan
Brown, Rodriguez's attorney, will argue that Borrego broke into the
home. Texas law allows the use of deadly force for home protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a burglary,'' said Brown. ``The guy didn't have the
right to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's indictment is the latest chapter in the ongoing saga
of Rodriguez, the first Latino to break into country music stardom.
Over the years he recorded 15 top 10 country singles and released
more than 30 albums, earning a place in the Country Music Hall of
Fame's Walkway of the Stars. Rodriguez once played Carnegie Hall,
and even a gig at the Inaugural Ball for President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way there was drug and alcohol abuse, a string of
busted marriages and now perhaps the most crippling of all, the
murder indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking it as good as I would expect anyone could,'' Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   Released on $50,000 bond last summer, Rodriguez has kept playing
at county fairs and small clubs. Most recently he played a New
Year's gig at the venerable Floore's Country Store in Helotes, just
outside San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Rodriguez can resurrect his career may depend on
whether a jury in state district court believes his account of what
happened Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   According to Brown, Rodriguez was on Tovar's porch early that
Saturday morning when he heard a sound in his mother's house. (She
no longer lives there.)
</P>
<P>
   Walking toward the house, Rodriguez contends that he picked up a
.357 Magnum he kept by the door and fired once in the dark, not
realizing whom he hit.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez maintains that he knew Borrego, but not well. And
according to Brown he had warned Borrego to stay away from his
mother's house. But Borrego's wife, Anita, has said Borrego and
Rodriguez were friends who often partied at Rodriguez's mother's
house. One theory holds that he was there fixing breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``An intruder is someone who is uninvited or someone you don't
know,'' said Hackebeil. ``I think you'll find that neither was the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   While Borrego's life story is sketchy, Rodriguez's is the stuff
of legend. His rise to stardom was launched in the UvaldeCounty
Jail, where as a teen-ager he was locked up for stealing an
expensive Angora goat and grilling it with friends.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas Ranger recognized him in jail as the teen who put on
impromptu singing performances on park benches in nearby Garner
State Park and posted bond for him, helping him to land a job
singing in weekend western skits in nearby Bracketville. Two years
later, he left Uvalde County for Nashville, Tenn., with his guitar
and $14.

DOW MOSTLY RECOVERS AFTER EARLY PLUNGE, TO CLOSE 7.21 DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks retreated from record levels but then rallied
in the afternoon and finished little changed in a session marked by
some warnings of profit shortfalls and a mildly negative
reappraisal by one of Wall Street's most prominent strategists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.21 points, to 9,537.76,
after a slide from the start of trading that put the blue-chip
barometer down as much as 118.95 points. The Nasdaq market, down
early, even managed to climb back into positive territory to
another record, its fifth in a row. It rose 5.23 points, or 0.2
percent, to 2,326.09. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell
2.61 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,269.73
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is backing and filling after a pretty
amazing run,'' said Douglas Cligott, chief U.S. equity strategist
at J.P. Morgan. And while he called valuations ``clearly
stretched,'' he said stocks could keep advancing for at least
several weeks as retail investors join portfolio managers in
putting cash that builds up at this time of year to work.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Penney and Borders Group dampened early sentiment by
warning of earnings shortfalls. The shares of J.C. Penney fell 3
5/16, to 43; Borders dropped 5 1/16, to 20.
</P>
<P>
   The market also had to digest a reduction in stocks, to 70
percent from 72 percent, in the portfolio mix recommended by Abby
Joseph Cohen, the widely followed chief strategist at Goldman,
Sachs. This was the first change since Sept. 1, when Ms. Cohen
raised her equity weighting from 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equity valuation is less attractive today than in September,''
she said, ``but we do not view valuation as excessive nor as an
impediment to higher stock prices.'' She suggested moving money
from stocks to higher-yielding corporate bonds, whose allocation
she raised to 12 percent from 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also bringing down the market were comments made by Federal
Reserve Vice Chairwoman Alice Rivlin, who said that one must be
``extremely optimistic about earnings to justify'' current stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   And while European markets were moderately lower, Brazilian
stocks dropped 5.14 percent on fresh setbacks to efforts to bring
the budget under control.
</P>
<P>
   But when the combined weight of these developments failed to
severely buckle the market, analysts said, buyers stepped in and
prices mostly recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to have a very favorable environment for
equities,'' said Leif Olsen, a director of Absolute Return Advisors
in Manchester, Vt., predicting a stronger economy this year than is
generally forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Several financial stocks stood out Thursday, among them
Citigroup, which surged 4[, to 58{, making the biggest positive
contribution to the Dow. Chase Manhattan climbed 3 1/16, to 77
1/16; BankAmerica was up 3 3/16, to 67 9/16, and Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter climbed 3{, to 84 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   The main drag on the Dow was Procter &AMP; Gamble, which fell 2, to
90~, as it lost a top executive in its Asian operations to Kellogg.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered
advancing ones by 1,954 to 1,142 as volume eased to 863 million
shares, from 986.9 million Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, the prices of Treasury issues fell as the
dollar weakened. The price of the 30-year bond fell 30/32, to 100
14/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the
price, rose to 5.22 percent, from 5.16 percent Wednesday.

EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK: THE EVERYDAY RETURNS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   All of the days with eves before them are behind us now for
another year. The grand themes _ rebirth and genial carnality _
have come and gone like a chinook wind, bringing a familiar
end-of-year thaw to body and spirit. Now the everyday returns, and
with it the ordinary kind of week in which Friday doesn't turn into
Sunday _ and Saturday into Sunday _ as it has for two weeks
running. It's time for a week in which each morning throws off a
magnetic field all its own, when it's no trick telling Tuesday from
Wednesday just by the sound of the alarm clock or the mood of your
spouse.
</P>
<P>
   With the everyday, winter comes to the new year. In the country,
it isn't necessarily snowfall that marks the return of winter nor
the sudden drop in temperature. It's the sound of the plow-guy
clearing the driveway well after dark, when the dogs are already
asleep, too tired from an afternoon of running around a snowy field
to rise and bark at the scraping and banging outside. In the time
it takes to wonder what the racket is, you remember.
</P>
<P>
   It was last winter's sound and now it is this winter's too. It
seems surprising that the plow-guy even recalls where you live and
that such a flimsy agreement _ a couple of words and a nod over a
rolled-down pickup window _ could have such presumptive force. But
that is the nature of the country, where lifelong service contracts
are formed in an instant and attach to the property, not the
person, as newcomers discover to their interest. Getting out of
those contracts is like getting out of winter. Better just to move.
</P>
<P>
   Winter's own presumptive force made itself plain recently, with
rain upon snow followed by snow upon ice late into the darkness.
The next morning my footsteps to the barn through the slush the
night before had been preserved with remarkable clarity _ each one
a life-mask of my boot-sole, the splash frozen in midair like a
Harold Edgerton photo.
</P>
<P>
   In the sunshine, snow slid off the metal barn roof with a hiss
and the horses skittered out from the run-in shed, taking pleasure,
as they always seem to do, in a momentary fright, having found out
in a single night how to pick their way over ice again. The roads
are suddenly full of the over-tentative and the over-bold, for the
cold, clean blacktop looks like hard-packed snow, and sometimes it
actually is. Other seasons come abruptly but ask so little when
they do. Winter is the only one that has to be relearned. &QL;

 &HT;    Senate to debate trial proceedings once again
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr and Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stymied by a dispute over whether to hear from
witnesses, senators will try again today to draw up a blueprint for
the impeachment trial of President Clinton and strike a bipartisan
pose.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the procedure senators eventually decide on, White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said, ``We are convinced we can make a
compelling case that will lead the United States Senate not to
remove the president.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, senators cannot figure out a way that
is acceptable to Democrats and Republicans to get things under way.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting in party caucuses Thursday, the entire Senate is
expected to gather at 9:30 this morning behind closed doors in the
Senate's old chamber, last used for official business in 1858.
</P>
<P>
   During a day of pomp and ceremony that included the reading of
the impeachment articles and an oath of impartiality taken by Chief
Justice William Rehnquist and the 100 senators, both sides said
they would prefer to avoid a lengthy trial, although they gave
different interpretations of the ideal length.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest stumbling block to beginning the real work of
the trial appeared to be whether to call witnesses and, if so, how
many and which ones.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) says Democrats are
nearly united in their desire to hold a quick trial of the nation's
42nd president with no witnesses. That is also the wish of the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, special assistant to the president, said the White
House was willing to stipulate to the record amassed during the
House Judiciary Committee inquiry in an effort to expedite the
trial _ in exchange for not calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats noted the irony that the Republicans running the House
Judiciary Committee refused to call witnesses during their
four-month inquiry, but were now eager to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't necessary then, why is it necessary now?'' Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) asked after an event he attended at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day, the Democrats offered Republicans a modified
version of an earlier bipartisan proposal for a quick trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Democratic plan, House prosecutors would present their
case Tuesday and Wednesday. The president's lawyers would have the
following two days to present a defense.
</P>
<P>
   Senators would have two days during the following week to ask
questions, then devote one day to closing arguments. They would
deliberate beginning January 22 and vote on the articles of
impeachment on January 26.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans appeared to be moving toward agreement on
allowing each side three to five days to make a presentation and
then deciding whether to allow witnesses to be called. Several
Republicans said they would be skittish about certain witnesses,
including Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But neither are they willing to rule out calling witnesses at
the start of the trial. ``I just don't think that's fair,'' said
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.).
</P>
<P>
   Republicans would like to hear from the prosecutors beginning
Thursday and wrap up the impeachment trial no later than Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican prosecutors from the House, on the other hand,
want to call several witnesses _ as many as 18, by some counts _ to
bolster their contention that the president committed perjury and
obstructed justice in concealing his affair with Lewinsky, a former
White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they fear that the Republican proposal could open
the Senate to an unending parade of witnesses, and the kind of
salacious talk they dearly want to keep out of their chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations continued throughout the day as senators conferred
in the Senate chamber in full view, but not earshot, of the press.
Votes on how to proceed were scheduled, then called off as talks
wore on. Lott scrapped a joint meeting set for Thursday afternoon
when Democrats refused to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, late in the afternoon, Lott and Daschle met in the
Senate, empty except for spectators and reporters, where they
reached an agreement for today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Describing their talks to reporters, the two leaders declared a
new-found comity in their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that the best way to keep calm and cool and dignified
is to look at each other and talk to each other,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle agreed: ``I think there is some common ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for bipartisanship is rooted in the institution _ the
Senate operates by consensus much more so than does the House _ and
a wish to avoid a repeat of the bitterly partisan bickering that
consumed the House just before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators, in particular, feared they would suffer the
same fate as their counterparts in the House, who drew widespread
public criticism for the nature of their impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an awful lot at stake for this institution,'' Sen.
Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) said. ``One of the things at stake is the
public view of the institution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We take an oath, a special oath to do impartial justice,''
Thompson said. ``We take this seriously. It's past the time to take
partisan strategic advantage on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Another argument against partisanship in the Senate trial is the
Constitution's requirement that two-thirds of the Senate, or 67
senators, must vote to convict the president to remove him from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have 55 seats, meaning they would need to vote in
unison and attract at least 12 of the 45 Senate Democrats to
convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Few people on either side consider Clinton's removal from office
a realistic possibility, which has led some Republicans to favor an
abbreviated trial over a drawn-out proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, the White House spokesman, warned Thursday that
calling witnesses would open ``a whole area of motions, discovery
and depositions. And that takes time.''

   WASHINGTON _ Pressing Baghdad's challenge against American and
British control of its skies, an Iraqi antiaircraft battery on
Thursday turned its radar on an American fighter jet, which
responded by firing a missile at it, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has stepped up its defiance ever since the United States
and Britain carried out four days of air and missile strikes last
month. It has vowed to end all cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors and to reassert its sovereignty over the no-flight zones
created after the Persian Gulf War ended in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's encounter took place over northern Iraq. Two Iraqi
jets also swooped into the no-flight zone in southern Iraq on
Thursday, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   In the north, an F-16 fighter patrolling the area attacked the
Iraqi antiaircraft battery with a radar-seeking missile on Thursday
morning. The F-16 struck in self-defense, the Pentagon said, after
its pilot and another in an EA-6B electronic fighter jet detected
the battery radar's action in beginning to track the F-16,
evidently in preparation to fire.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said the battery
radar abruptly stopped when the F-16's missile struck, indicating
that the attack destroyed it. But the extent of the damage was not
immediately clear because of cloudy weather.
</P>
<P>
   The F-16 and other American aircraft patrolling the area
returned unharmed to their base at Incirlik, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's skirmish was the fourth since the United States and
Britain carried out the strikes last month. On Tuesday, American
jets fired on Iraqi MIG's for the first time in six years, but
missed. In all, Iraq has sent 13 to 15 jets into the no-flight
zones in the most serious challenge yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and the Pentagon have played down the
military significance of the Iraqi challenges, saying jets or
helicopters ``darting'' into the restricted zones, as an official
put it on Thursday, posed no real threat to American or British
patrols.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior defense official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the challenges had become ``more frequent, complex
and aggressive'' and were expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of American forces in the region, Gen. Anthony C.
Zinni, said on Thursday that the United States had detected more
than 40 instances when Iraqi aircraft had violated the no-flight
zone in the south since the American and British strikes against
Iraq ended on Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The flights appeared to be an effort to lure American and
British jets into a confrontation, he said. ``These seem to be
attempts to shoot down one of our aircraft,'' he said. ``It seems
to be, by our estimation, a desperate attempt to get some sort of
event, to claim some sort of victory, or to use the event for some
sort of propaganda advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies created the zone in the north
in 1991 and the one in the south a year later to protect ethnic
populations from repression by President Saddam Hussein's forces.
They did so citing the authority of the U.N. resolutions imposed as
a condition for ending the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Although the administration has vowed to enforce the zones and
has portrayed the challenges to them as ineffective, the threats
have forced the United States and Britain into a reactive position,
forced to defend against Iraq's cat-and-mouse provocations at times
of Iraq's choosing.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's defense secretary, George Robertson, warned on
Thursday that Iraq faced further ``decisive action'' if its forces
continued to threaten American and British jets over the no-flight
zones. ``We remain ready,'' he said in London, ``and if action is
necessary, it will be taken and taken without notice.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a meeting of the Senate's Armed Services Committee on
Tuesday, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., expressed frustration that the
administration was not doing more to respond to the provocations.
He said it was unconscionable to put American and British pilots at
risk without again bombing Iraqi bases.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton,
responded by saying the Pentagon already had plans ``on the shelf''
to strike Iraq again ``if the president were to see fit to take
that type of action.'' Zinni reiterated that on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But Bacon said American jets had now destroyed three different
antiaircraft or surface-to-air missile batteries in the skirmishes.
An Iraqi aircraft involved in Tuesday's confrontation also crashed,
apparently after running out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's losing more than he's gaining,'' Bacon said of Saddam.

(ATTN: N.Y.)   PAUL MANHEIM, 93, LEHMAN PARTNER AND ART COLLECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paul Manheim, a collector of Asian art, died on New
Year's Day at his home in East Hampton, 54 years to the day after
he became a partner at the old Wall Street investment house of
Lehman Brothers. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   It was Manheim who led Lehman Brothers into providing individual
investment services to wealthy Americans in the prosperous years
after World War II, said Robert Rubin, a former president of the
brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Manheim started as a statistical analyst in 1928, when the idea
of technical research was relatively new on Wall Street. He was
made a partner on Jan. 1, 1944 and, over the years, he managed
money, worked on rehabilitating failed companies and in 1958 helped
organize the One William Street Fund, the first open-end investment
fund offered by Lehman, which was slow to expand from a wealthy
clientele into selling its expertise to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today on Wall Street you are a specialist,'' Rubin said, ``an
analyst or money manager or broker, but he had his hand in
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Manheim came to New York as an infant. He was born in what is
now the Slovak Republic, where his father and grandfather were
timber merchants.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the University of Virginia in 1925, he
went to work in the Caribbean for Dunbar Molasses and was U.S.
consul in Guyana, which at the time was a colony known as British
Guiana. He returned to New York in 1927, worked briefly for a
brokerage firm and then joined Lehman Brothers in 1928 as a
statistical research analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he was a director of Air Express International,
Ekco Products, Great Western Financial, Loew's, Media General,
Paramount Pictures, Postal Telegraph and Cable Corp. and Western
Union.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to limited-partner status in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Simone Gardner; a brother, Frank, of
London; a sister, Louise Espy of Manhattan; two daughters, Emily
Goldman of Santa Fe, N.M., and Martha Green of Brooklyn; a son,
Anthony, of Brooklyn; seven grandchildren and three
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   His marriages to Kate Carns in 1931 and to Ruth Gram in 1958
ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Manheim used his growing wealth to acquire Asian
art, especially from India and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   But on Labor Day weekend in 1975, a chain-smoking burglar broke
into Manheim's East Side mansion and used an acetylene torch to cut
through the double steel doors on its walk-in vault. The burglar
took 200 pieces of Asian art, including a bronze Buddha on a lion
throne from Nepal and a Chinese bronze dagger dating to 1700 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the first of a rash of burglaries at the homes of
collectors of Asian art at a time when prices were soaring. The
police put Manheim's losses at $750,000, about $2.3 million in
today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   His closest friend, Alistair Cooke, the writer and retired host
of ``Masterpiece Theater,'' said: ``The burglary just took all the
steam out of him. He really lost all interest in collecting after
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI later recovered much of the art, and Manheim donated
many of the items to the Brooklyn Museum, where he was a governor
from 1969 to 1982, said Amy Poster, the museum's Asian art curator.
</P>
<P>
   Manheim also gave parts of his collection to the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art and to art galleries at Hofstra University and
the University of Virginia, his son said.

DOLPHINS SCOFFING AT SHARPE'S CRITICISM
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Shannon Sharpe's words live.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos' tight end had asserted in late December,
shortly after a 10-point loss in Miami, that his team was 10 to 14
points better than the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins also recall how Sharpe had earlier suggested that
Denver quarterback John Elway is unlike Miami's Dan Marino in that
Elway has not lost ability over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins, who on Saturday play at Denver in an American
Football Conference semifinal, are firing back at Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he says doesn't have much value any more,'' offensive
guard Kevin Donnalley said Thursday. ``He said some things that are
so far off the mark about Marino, besides what he said about us.
You've got to think he did this latest thing just to get attention
and cover up the fact they lost the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran defensive end Trace Armstrong seemed more amused
than anything. ``One thing is for sure,'' Armstrong said. ``He is
pretty proud of his First Amendment rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Lamar Thomas, who caught three touchdown passes in
Miami's 31-21 victory over Denver, saw something of his former self
in Sharpe's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a college where all we did was talk,'' the
University of Miami alumnus said. ``You know what, he can talk all
he wants, but you can throw all that out once the game starts. It's
all about what you're doing at that moment. I think it's going to
be a great game and they're going to have to come to play just like
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Zach Thomas was told that Sharpe said Thomas got the
best of him on pass plays the last time the teams played.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a setup,'' Thomas said, smiling. ``I'm not going to
fall for that. That's what I like to do. Tell 'em how great they
are, and then just kill 'em in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Dolphins, cornerback Sam Madison is the one who seems to
most consistently enjoy antagonizing the opposition. Last week, he
made fun of Buffalo quarterback Doug Flutie's height. This week, he
jabbed back at Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we're a much better team than them,'' he said. ``They
came down here and we beat them, but nobody's talking about that.
They were favored then, they're favored now. The only thing that's
happened is we're going up there to play them again. Same
scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison went on to add that he was not overly impressed with
Denver's receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play great receivers all year,'' he said. ``They're pretty
good. They complement each other just like our receivers complement
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Thomas has reformed from his popping-off days at Miami.
This week he hasn't even been tempted to gloat about his
three-touchdown game against Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a magical night,'' he said. ``It's hard to think that
could ever happen again, but I'm going to try my best to make some
of those same type of plays, if the situation presents itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas scoffed at the notion that he might be a marked man.
``Not little ol' me,'' he said, smiling. ``That'll be very
flattering, but I really think they'll come in with the same game
plan. All season long people said we didn't have the receiving
corps. We just have to make the plays when we have to make 'em.
That was the difference last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas recently signed a two-year contract extension. His lawyer
told him that he would probably be able to make more money by
opting for free agency, but Thomas didn't even consider it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt so thankful that they continue to have faith in
me,'' he said. ``I didn't really want to go anywhere else. You
know, next year I'll probably go back to being the fourth or fifth
receiver, but this is the place I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   And thus far, he's living a late-season dream. ``It's been an
awesome year,'' he said. ``I actually don't want it to end.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Dolphins have heard a sobering reminder this
week: they have not won a road playoff game, excluding Super Bowls,
since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't even born then,'' said Zach Thomas, the linebacker.
``So there's no pressure. We'll go in there and stay loose.
Hopefully we won't panic if they jump on us with a quick score.
We're just going to fly around like we did last time and see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   It will take more than talk to win, said Miami linebacker
Derrick Rodgers. ``We'll see who's talking at the end of the
game,'' he observed.

COUNT OF GALAXIES SOARS IN HUBBLE-IMPROVED CENSUS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Taking a census of the galaxies in the universe
is like counting the grains of sand on a beach. Even with leaping
extrapolations, the task is probably impossible, and the numbers
become, well, astronomical.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, astronomers studying new pictures taken by the Hubble
Space Telescope announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical
Society here Thursday an updated estimate of the number of galaxies
in the observable universe: 125 billion. As recently as three years
ago, the count was only 50 billion, which was subsequently raised
to 80 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The new figure reflects not a spurt in galactic births, of
course, but instead an improvement in the Hubble telescope's
ability to peer deep into the universe, back closer to the first
epoch in which matter coalesced into stars and stars congregated in
vast galaxies. The new observations have detected some faint
galaxies so far away that they were probably formed when the
universe was no more than 1 billion years old, less than 10 percent
of its current estimated age of some 13 billion years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Henry Ferguson, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science
Institute in Baltimore, said the new galaxy estimate was derived
from the Hubble telescope's observations of a small patch of
southern sky taken over a 10-day period in October. The pictures,
called the Hubble Deep Field South, were a sequel to a similar
survey of a part of the northern sky made in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The southern survey was able to get a deeper cosmic view because
of two new instruments that had been added to the Hubble telescope.
One is a camera for recording objects seen in near-infrared light;
it can detect galaxies otherwise obscured by dust. The other
instrument was an imaging spectrograph that produced some of the
deepest optical pictures ever taken.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs revealed galaxies of all sizes and shapes in a
narrow corridor of the sky, reaching back some 12 billion years.
Astronomers counted 620 galaxies there. The previous survey, which
covered a larger section of the northern sky, showed more than
3,000 galaxies. From these numbers, the Hubble astronomers
extrapolated a total galaxy population of 125 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said the count came as no surprise, because other
evidence indicates that star and galaxy formation was particularly
rampant in the early universe.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers expect the findings to help refine models of galaxy
formation and evolution through time. And their field of study just
expanded, inasmuch as each large galaxy comprises perhaps a billion
stars.

by millions of people around the world, died on Tuesday in Chestnut
Hill, Mass. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   The advances that Zoll and other researchers began making in the
1950s were applied widely and quickly and made possible the
development of coronary-care units.
</P>
<P>
   All that was vastly different when Zoll returned from military
service in World War II to work at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston.
At that time the standard treatment for cardiac arrest was crude: a
doctor would cut into the chest and squeeze the heart with his hand
to pump blood through the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cardiologists carried large jackknives and even our poor
eye surgeons were taken to the dog laboratories and shown how to
cut chests open under emergency conditions,'' Zoll wrote in a
scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
   During that era, and early in his research, Zoll said he
encountered widespread disbelief _ even after initial successes _
that he could electrically stimulate the heart to make it beat
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Zoll and a team of other doctors in Boston applied
electric charges externally to the chest to resuscitate two
patients whose hearts had stopped. The first patient lived only 20
minutes. The second patient survived for 11 months, after 52 hours
of electrical stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the next spring, the U &UR; . &LR;  S &UR; . &LR;  Public Health Service
rejected his application for a $5,000 grant to finance his research
for a year, because the head of the grants award committee, an
eminent physiologist from Cleveland, had failed in trying to do
similar research years earlier, Zoll wrote in a scientific paper.
He did not name the physiologist.
</P>
<P>
   After Zoll reported his findings at a scientific meeting, a
close friend and leading cardiologist in Boston turned to Zoll's
wife and said the device was a toy that would have little medical
use.
</P>
<P>
   Zoll went on to develop external pacemakers to restore normal
rhythms in patients whose hearts were beating erratically and
dangerously. But Zoll continued to meet opposition from many
fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people, including my own cardiac fellow, thought that it
might be blasphemous, improper or unethical to keep a patient alive
by such artificial means,'' Zoll wrote.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, external pacemakers, which kept patients
tethered to large machines, were the main treatment for a condition
known as heart block. But in addition to limiting patients
physically, the devices sometimes caused burns, involuntary muscle
contractions and sometimes intolerable pain.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish researchers then developed the permanent, implanted
pacemakers that are widely used today.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues described Zoll as a serious, quiet man who insisted
that students and co-workers meet his intellectual and working
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many brilliant people, he didn't run with the crowd,''
said Julian M. Aroesty, a cardiologist who worked with Zoll for
many years. ``He was convinced of what was right, and he was going
to strike off in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Maurice Zoll was born on July 15, 1911, in Boston. He
graduated from Boston Latin School and from Harvard College and
Harvard Medical School. After interning at Beth Israel Hospital in
Boston, Zoll took further training at Bellevue Hospital in New York
City, then served as a doctor in England in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that his interest in electrical charges to the
heart was piqued, as he watched a classmate and heart surgeon,
Dwight Harken, remove shrapnel and other foreign objects from
beating hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Zoll then returned to Beth Israel, where he practiced and
conducted research until 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that initially his background in electricity was
inadequate to build a pacemaker. But he went on to learn in part
from reports by a Canadian heart surgeon and borrowing a standard
physiological pacemaker made in nearby Quincy.
</P>
<P>
   He felt that without complaining about it, he was not
appropriately recognized until 1973 when he won an Albert Lasker
Clinical Medical Research Award, Aroesty said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoll founded the Zoll Medical Corporation, a pioneer in
manufacturing defibrillators. From 1956 to 1965, he was associate
editor of the journal Circulation, which is published by the
American Heart Association in Dallas. In his later years, he
developed Alzheimer's disease, said his wife, Ann.
</P>
<P>
   Zoll's first wife, the former Janet Jones, died several years
ago. He is also survived by a son, Ross, of Woodbridge, Conn., and
a daughter, Mary Zoll of Newton, Mass.

MARKET PLACE: TRADING HOUSES BREATHING EASIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street's major trading houses, buffeted by the
financial upheaval that began when Russian markets collapsed in
August, are starting to breathe a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. and Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., two of the country's largest investment banking firms,
soundly beat estimates for their fourth-quarter earnings Thursday,
the latest sign of how resilient U.S. financial markets have proved
to be in the wake of global economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a measure of how quickly firms and markets have turned
around since the early fall,'' said Derek Statkevicus, an analyst
with Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods. ``The trading desks have done much
better than people expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Citigroup soared $4.125, or almost 7.6 percent
Thursday, to $58.50, as investors saw that company's trading
operation benefiting from the same financial buoyancy enjoyed by
its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Morgan and Lehman turned in sharply divergent
performances, with Morgan producing stellar gains while Lehman's
profits were far below those posted in the fourth quarter of 1997.
In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Morgan's shares jumped
$3.50, or 4.3 percent, to $84.1875, while Lehman's shares rose 50
cents, to $54.125.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even though international markets have settled down
recently, the fragility of Brazil's economy _ and the financial
damage that could be inflicted on the United States should Brazil's
situation worsen _ looms over American financial services
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of money coming into the market right now and
people might be unpleasantly surprised if things turn worse in
Brazil,'' said Judah Kraushaar, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, citing strong results from its securities operation in a
year marked by unnerving stock market volatility, said net income
for the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30 rose 51 percent to $1.2
billion, or $2.07 a share, compared with $810 million, or $1.30 a
share, in the corresponding period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter of 1998 included a large one-time gain on the
sale of some business lines. Excluding that gain, Morgan's
operating earnings still rose 9 percent to a record $879 million,
or $1.49 a share. Analysts had been expecting Morgan to report
operating earnings of 96 cents a share in the quarter, according to
the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp.
Morgan posted operating earnings of $626 million, or $1.05 a share,
in the third quarter ended Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Morgan's securities business _ which includes
securities underwriting, mergers and acquisitions advice, other
investment-banking services and retail brokerage activities _
produces the lion's share of the company's profits. The fourth
quarter was no exception. Morgan said about half its profit in the
quarter came from its securities operation, powered by gains in
mergers and acquisitions advice that more than offset an
industry-wide downturn in underwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Scott, Morgan's chief financial officer, said the
company's traders ``tore the cover off the ball'' by moving into
Treasury securities and realizing big gains once other investors
sought the same safe haven after stock and bond markets around the
world went haywire in the late summer and early fall. The company
also said that currency and commodities trading generated record
results.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Profits from Morgan's asset-management business were up smartly
in the quarter compared with 1997, though down compared to the
third quarter when the company registered losses on some troubled
investment funds it was forced to bail out. The company's Discover
credit-card operation still lacks the scale to compete effectively
with the larger credit-card businesses controlled by competitors,
but Morgan said it was planning to devote substantial resources to
expanding the card business, particularly overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Morgan is one of the few financial-services companies,
with the exception of Chase Manhattan Corp., that appear to have
navigated last year's unpredictable financial shoals successfully.
``It's a very, very powerful company,'' said John Keefe, president
of Keefe Worldwide, a financial-services consulting firm in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, on the other hand, has had a far rougher time, largely
because it does not dominate as many businesses as Morgan does and
because it is still overly reliant on its large bond underwriting
and trading operation _ a reliance that can hammer the company if
it plays the bond markets incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman said it had net income of $74 million, or 51 cents a
share, in the fourth quarter ended November 30, down 60 percent
from $185 million, or $1.30 a share in the same period a year
earlier. Lehman earned $151 million, or $1.10 a share, in the third
quarter ended August 31.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Lehman to earn 21 cents a share in the
quarter and attributed the surprise to better-than-expected results
in its investment-banking business. Still, Lehman said its trading
revenues were down sharply because of market volatility in
September and October that hurt its bond business.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman noted that even though it had a weak quarter, the firm
posted record results for the year as a whole. It also said it is
optimistic about 1999 because of a recovery in the bond market and
a backlog of debt and equity underwritings that should lift the
bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're off to a gangbusters start in January, and the
fundamentals of a good year are in place,'' John Cecil, Lehman's
chief administrative officer, said.

 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DENVER _ Revenge is a motive that few teams will admit to, and
it is unbecoming of a defending Super Bowl champion. But listen to
the Denver Broncos discuss the Miami Dolphins, and it's obvious
they consider Saturday's second-round playoff game payback time.
</P>
<P>
   In a Monday-night game at Pro Player Stadium on Dec. 21, Miami
embarrassed Denver 31-21. Dan Marino outplayed John Elway by
throwing for 355 yards and four touchdowns. The Dolphins' defense
limited the Broncos to a season-low 219 yards. And Denver running
back Terrell Davis rushed for only 29 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Dolphins' dominance, Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe
claimed after the game that the Broncos were ``10 to 14 points
better.''
</P>
<P>
   When Sharpe was reminded of his postgame comments this week, he
didn't soften his stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're looking for me, I ain't hard to find,'' Sharpe
said. ``If they're looking for something to say, I'm going to give
them something to say. I said what I said, and I'm not going to
back down from any of my comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they need stuff to get them motivated, so be it. We come
out to play the game. We play hard. We play physical. We play
tough. We don't put stuff on the bulletin board, but you best
believe we'll be ready Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver defensive tackle Trevor Pryce agrees with Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played a good game that night, but I think on paper we're
a better team,'' Pryce said. ``I don't know about how many points
better, but I know we're a better team. I know we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Dolphins blew off comments by Sharpe and Pryce, but
not all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we're a much better team than them,'' Dolphins
cornerback Sam Madison said. ``Are we going to get it done? We've
been doing it all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami led the NFL with 29 interceptions. Madison and cornerback
Terrell Buckley, who had eight interceptions each, shut down
Denver's 1,000-yard receivers, Rod Smith and Ed McCaffrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The receivers _ myself, Rod, Ed _ we didn't make the plays,''
Sharpe said. ``I don't want to do anything to diminish what they
did. They stopped us. They won the game, and now we get an
opportunity to see if it was for real or if it was a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone would have told me going into that game they were
going to hold Terrell Davis to 29 yards, John wasn't going to be
able to throw the football (13-of-36 for 151 yards, no touchdowns
and two interceptions), and we weren't going to be able to get away
from bump coverage, I wouldn't have believed that. As a matter of
fact, I probably would have laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins allowed the fewest points in the league, and they
ranked third in defense. But they won't be at full strength on
defense because end Jason Taylor, their best pass rusher, and
tackle Tim Bowens, their best run stuffer, are out with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Davis, who rushed for 2,008 yards, to finish with
29 again.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can't happen again,'' Davis said. ``Just looking at the
film, I was a step or two from making a big run. I need to make
those plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got outplayed. They have a good defense, one of the
best defenses we played all year, so you can't take anything away
from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Zach Thomas led a ferocious Miami defense that
played its best game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zach won that one, but I'll be ready this time,'' Sharpe said.
``He played better than I did, and I tip my hat to him. I didn't
think he was that good in the beginning, but I have a newfound
respect for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver coach Mike Shanahan will try to devise a strategy that
will help Davis find more running room. When Davis is running well
and finding the cutback lanes, it opens up the passing game for
Elway.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' 28-21 victory over Seattle was a good example of
Shanahan's strategy. Davis rushed for 178 yards and caught a
touchdown pass. Elway threw four TD passes. Although the coaches
won't say it publicly, they don't want all the pressure to fall on
Elway unless it's for a late drive to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have 20-something yards (rushing) like we did,
you've got to do a much better job in a lot of different areas,''
Shanahan said. ``That's one of the few times that we didn't block
the safeties as well as we have done in the past, and we have to
improve in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Broncos visited Miami, they were coming off their upset
loss to the Giants that ended their quest to become the first 19-0
team. Some claimed Denver played it close to the vest against the
Dolphins and didn't use much of its game plan because Shanahan
figured they would play again in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was talking about, `Was it a weakened game plan
because there was a possibility we might see them again?''' Sharpe
said. ``Hey, they stopped us. They played great defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson has been low-key this week as he
prepares for the Broncos. He doesn't place much emphasis on a game
that was played nearly three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day is a different day as far as players that are
healthy, situations where you play, situations with the team as far
as the stake they have in it,'' Johnson said. ``Obviously, with
Denver having the home-field advantage wrapped up, it wasn't as
important a game for them because we were trying to fight to get
into the playoffs. A lot of factors enter into it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is that we'll be there Saturday. We'll play,
and we'll find out.''

PAYMENTS BY SALT LAKE OLYMPIC OFFICIALS UNCOVERED

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Cash payments were made by local Olympic
officials to members of the International Olympic Committee during
this city's bid to be awarded the 2002 Winter Games, according to
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   One investigator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
individual payments ranged from $5,000 to $70,000 and were made to
IOC members from Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator said the payments appeared to have come from
the Salt Lake bid committee's $14 million, privately funded
operating budget, although the official said investigators were
still trying to determine the exact number of payments, the dollar
amounts and the full roster of recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators cautioned that the reasons for the payments
were not yet known and that it was possible some might be explained
as legitimate reimbursement for travel expenses or as money
earmarked for humanitarian aid such as athletic equipment or
training programs.
</P>
<P>
   The normal channels for making humanitarian contributions are
through an IOC program called Solidarity or through national
Olympic committees, not through individuals, although some IOC
members serve as presidents of their national Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they were trying to determine whether any of
the payments _ possible inducements apart from anything already
uncovered in the unfolding scandal _ occurred during the IOC
session in June 1995 in Budapest, Hungary, where Salt Lake won the
2002 Winter Games in a landslide vote over Ostersund, Sweden; Sion,
Switzerland; and Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   If investigators determine that the payments were made in an
effort to buy votes, the scandal here, already a profound
embarrassment to the city as well as to international Olympic
officials, will be raised a significant level.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake Olympic officials have previously acknowledged
spending nearly $400,000 on a tuition-payment and athletic-training
program that benefited 13 people, six of whom were relatives of IOC
members, most from Africa. Salt Lake officials described these
programs as humanitarian aid, not bribery. But investigators said
they were trying to determine if some of those tuition payments
went to relatives of IOC members who then never attended school.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have also discovered that $28,000 worth of medical
services were provided through the bid committee for three people
with apparent Olympic connections.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Welch, who was president of the Salt Lake Olympic bid
committee, has acknowledged giving items such as shotguns and skis
to IOC members, favors that exceeded the $150 limit on gifts set by
the U.S. Olympic Committee. But he has called this kind of
gift-giving commonplace and has said Salt Lake did not do anything
that other Olympic-bid cities had not done.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated calls made to Welch have not been returned in recent
days, and he did not answer the door at his condominium in Park
City.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said it might prove impossible to determine
whether any of Salt Lake's efforts in fact produced the desired
votes, as the 114 members of the IOC who decide on the sites for
the Games cast secret ballots. Moreover, the vote in 1995 was not
close, as Salt Lake won easily on the first ballot.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, it is also unclear to investigators whether such
a scheme would constitute a violation of any state or federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff at the organizing committee is not getting updates
from any investigator on what they might or might not be finding,''
said Shelley Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Salt Lake organizing
committee. ``These are more reasons why we are hoping for quick
conclusions and solid answers as to what happened during the
bidding process.''
</P>
<P>
   There are four separate investigations under way into Salt
Lake's efforts to secure the Olympics, including inquiries by the
IOC, the USOC, the U.S. Justice Department and an internal Salt
Lake ethics panel. All four investigations were prompted by bribery
charges made last month by Marc Hodler, a senior IOC official from
Switzerland who alleged that similar vote-buying efforts had been
made in many prior selection processes.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has announced that it will not strip Salt Lake of the
2002 Games. But executives of the USOC, concerned about shaken
corporate and public confidence in the Olympic movement and faced
with having to raise more than $200 million in a joint operating
agreement to reach Salt Lake's budget of $1.45 billion for the 2002
Games, have been meeting this week with Gov. Mike Leavitt of Utah
in an effort to try and rebuild public support.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has called on the private organizing committee to
place top Salt Lake Olympic officials on administrative leave
during the four investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials familiar with Salt Lake's bid for the 2002
Winter Games have described in recent weeks a process by which Salt
Lake Olympic officials targeted the votes of African IOC members
after losing by four votes to Nagano, Japan, for the right to play
host to the 1998 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their thinking was that they had lost the Olympic Games to a
bloc of African votes that had been purchased by others,'' said one
Olympic official familiar with the bid process, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``They were bound and determined not to
allow that to happen again. That's what started them down the
slippery slope.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodler, the Swiss IOC official, has said that as many as 25 of
the 114 IOC members may have sold their votes in recent elections
to name Olympic cities, and has said that agents, or middlemen,
demand up to $1 million to secure blocs of votes and then charge
the winning city $3 million to $5 million for their services.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of such extravagant demands has not surfaced, but in
the weeks since Hodler made his charges, a number of Olympic
officials have supported the notion that cities bidding on the
Olympics sometimes go too far in providing gifts and services and
that some members of the IOC have their hands out in expectation of
receiving lavish favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Washington, there are checks and balances in government;
but the IOC is not responsible to any constituency,'' said Robert
Helmick, a former member of the IOC and president of the U.S.
Olympic Committee who resigned in 1991 in a conflict-of-interest
scandal. ``Their excesses are allowed to go virtually unchecked.
That type of situation leads to corruption.''

 &HT;    League moves to rebuild fan support, ease restart
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first rule of a successful labor negotiation is
that the victor ``makes nice'' with the loser. So on Thursday, the
NBA gave players union executive director Billy Hunter a place on
the podium as they took the first steps toward rescuing the game's
image with its most important commodity _ the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner David Stern and his deputy, Russ Granik, praised
Hunter and his people as worthy adversaries and predicted a spirit
of cooperation after more than six months of public rancor that
sometimes became personal.
</P>
<P>
   In its first step toward regaining the customer base, the NBA
announced that it would become fan friendly immediately by
scheduling home-and-away exhibition games for each team with no
admission charge. The league also had a surprise for its often
paranoid coaches, saying there will be public scrimmages as well.
Many coaches, including the Hawks' Lenny Wilkens, often are loathe
to allow even the media to see what they are doing.
</P>
<P>
   Where possible, the league said, each team would set aside 500
tickets per game to be sold for $10 each. That won't be a problem
for the Hawks, who rarely sell out games at Georgia Tech and have a
yawning upper deck available at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   The league also will instruct its teams to open training
facilities to players from all teams located in their areas.
Strength and conditioning personnel will be on hand to assist them
as they prepare for training camps, expected to start Jan 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all happy to be back in the basketball business,''
Stern said, explaining that it took so long because the union
representatives were ``formidable adversaries.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the two sides are united in efforts to win back fans and
it would be done ``if we work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is not as advanced in its scheduling as many had hoped,
but the league said it would be able to play its 50- to 52-game
schedule by going to four games a week, up one-half game from the
norm. There will be some strings of three games in as many days,
but they will be kept to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   There was no word on trade deadlines or guaranteed salary dates.
That's how up in the air things are.
</P>
<P>
   Stern disagreed that the league had obtained cost certainty,
saying ``our players are going to get 55 percent of an
ever-increasing pie.'' By the end of the seven-year agreement, he
said, the average salary will have doubled to about $5 million per
player.

 SALT LAKE CITY: to corruption.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Helmick has accused Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the
IOC, of not being forceful enough in policing the excesses of
committee members. In an interview, Helmick spoke of IOC members
being taken on fur-coat and jewelry shopping sprees worth $3,000 to
$8,000 while visiting bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1991 IOC session in Birmingham, England, where the 1998
Winter Games were awarded to Nagano over Salt Lake, the IOC set up
its own parcel-post station so that its members could mail their
load of gifts home, Helmick said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Knapp, a member of the USOC's executive committee, said
that some of the criticism of Salt Lake seemed hypocritical, and
added that she believed the city was being made a scapegoat by the
IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can people who made this into an art form turn around and
say, `Oh, those bums,''' Knapp said. ``They knew it was Christmas
every day. It's amazing how they can ignore what has been common
knowledge and expect to have any credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Before their successful bid for the 2002 Games, Salt Lake City
had bid on the Winter Olympics four times over a period of 25 years
and lost every time. Local officials approached the 2002 Winter
Games with tempered confidence that their fifth bid would be a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Many Olympic officials, in the United States and elsewhere,
believe that Salt Lake would have won the 1998 Winter Games, if
another American city, Atlanta, had not been awarded the 1996
Summer Olympics. It had a superior bid in terms of sports
facilities and infrastructure. In losing by only four votes to
Nagano for 1998, according to American Olympic officials, Salt Lake
felt it was given a clear message by the IOC: ``Stay in another
four years and you will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake officials also received another message, according to
John Ruger, a member of the board of directors of the Salt Lake and
U.S. Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our people saw the largesse coming from Japan,'' Ruger
said. ``Japanese corporations had contributed to building the IOC
museum. There were rumors of diamond rings. I think our people saw
one bid committee doing something and thought they had to do a
little more. They didn't want to lose again. They got caught up in
that. I think it's a climate we've got to stop. The Salt Lake bid
committee definitely made mistakes and was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Needing more than 50 votes to claim a majority among IOC members
and to become host in 2002, Salt Lake would have to maintain a wide
base of international support. But the Salt Lake bid committee,
according to investigators as well as officials familiar with its
effort, paid close attention to one area that could prove to be
critical: Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Africa had never hosted any Olympic Games, and its IOC members
had no vested interest in where winter competitions were held. The
bid committee calculated that the North Americans would be divided
between Salt Lake and Quebec, while the European vote seemed likely
to be split by two other competitors: Sion, Switzerland, and
Ostersund, Sweden. There were 17 potentially decisive African votes
at stake.
</P>
<P>
   There has long been a perception among some Olympic officials
that African IOC members vote as a bloc, although this is
impossible to know, because the ballot is secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the record will show that there was a concerted effort
by some members from Africa who sought support for themselves from
this bid committee,'' said an Olympic official familiar with the
Salt Lake bid.
</P>
<P>
   In shaping Salt Lake's Africa strategy, local officials relied
in part on the advice and vast connections of Andrew Young, the
former ambassador to the United Nations who was chairman of the
Atlanta Olympic bid committee and was vital in securing the 1996
Summer Games. Young said he told Salt Lake officials that they
should travel to visit every IOC member personally and that they
should provide athletic training aid when possible in developing
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The local point man for Africa was Bennie Smith, a former
football player at Brigham Young University who is president of a
Salt Lake construction company. He is also black, which the
overwhelmingly white Salt Lake bid committee, according to American
Olympic officials familiar with the process, felt would be
advantageous in dealing with IOC members from Africa. Smith has
declined to speak to reporters about the vote-buying charges.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Young, however, were not the only people enlisted to
boost Salt Lake's cause. Salt Lake officials have acknowledged that
Mahmoud El Farnawani, a former national volleyball coach in Egypt,
was paid $58,000 by the Salt Lake bid committee in 1994 for his
assistance in providing access to IOC members from North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   And there was, too, direct financial assistance provided to
African IOC members and their families. In 1991, after losing to
Nagano, Salt Lake began a program of tuition and athletic training
assistance that continued until the fall of 1998. In a mid-December
interview Welch described the scholarship program as a legitimate
effort in the Olympic tradition of a rich nation helping poorer,
less developed nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt this was one of the roles we could play to improve an
understanding of who we were, and we could be of help,'' said
Welch, who resigned in 1997 as president of the Salt Lake Olympic
organizing committee after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor
charge of spousal battery. ``Most cities didn't bid as long as Salt
Lake. These people were our friends. I think we became part of the
Olympic family.''

 SALT LAKE CITY: Olympic family.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though the program has been defended as humanitarian aid, there
was potential strategic value to Salt Lake's aid.
</P>
<P>
   One scholarship went to the daughter of Rene Essomba, an IOC
member from Cameroon who, until he died last year, was executive
director of the national Olympic committees of Africa. The Salt
Lake scandal broke last November when a local television station
was leaked a 1996 letter from Dave Johnson, a top Salt Lake Olympic
official, to Sonia Essomba, saying that a $10,000 tuition payment
would be her last.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Ganga, an IOC member from Congo Republic and former
ambassador to China, received free treatment for hepatitis in Salt
Lake, one investigator said. Ganga holds influence as the president
of the national Olympic committees of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a third IOC member from Africa, David Sibandze of the
tiny kingdom of Swaziland, worked as an intern in City Hall in Salt
Lake during its bid for the 2002 Winter Games. The son also
received tuition assistance from local Olympic officials, an
investigator said, while he attended the University of Utah, where
he received bachelor's and master's degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Sibandze, the owner of a fast-food business in Swaziland who has
eight children, has been linked to scholarship offers and medical
services in three other recent Olympic bid cities. He said he did
not know if his son received tuition aid from Salt Lake officials,
but he added: ``Education is education. If you want your child to
be educated, you try everything you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Ramsamy, the president of the South African Olympic
Committee, has cautioned against assuming that IOC members from
Africa are susceptible to corruption. Other Olympic officials said
it was important to realize that the Olympic movement involves many
cultures, and things that seem inappropriate in one culture are
considered appropriate in other cultures.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Young said that while he did not know about the
scholarships and free medical care, he considered these programs to
be a show of Olympic generosity and solidarity, not bribery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any problem with people educating anybody,
anytime, for any reason,'' Young said, adding that ``this is one of
the things that levels the playing field, not corrupts it.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the IOC have declined to publicly chastise other
members. Privately, though, several said they found it disturbing
that any member would benefit personally from a city bidding on the
Winter or Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Heiberg, an IOC member from Norway, said in an interview
that one or more members of the committee should be expelled ``to
show that we are serious and to prevent this from happening
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodler has identified El Farnawani, who lives in a Toronto
suburb, as an agent who offered to sell blocs of votes for money.
El Farnawani was quoted in a Toronto newspaper in 1995 as saying
that he had ``assured'' the North African vote to Salt Lake
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, however, El Farnawani said he offered only
access to IOC members from North Africa, not guarantees. He could
not guarantee a bloc of votes, because the voting is done by secret
ballot, he said. A bid city would be foolish to pay him an
exorbitant amount of money to deliver a bloc of votes, he said,
because he could never prove that he had delivered the votes.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi, the IOC member from
Libya, has acknowledged receiving tuition aid to two Utah
universities from Salt Lake Olympic officials from 1995 until last
October.
</P>
<P>
   El Farnawani, who described Bashir Attarabulsi as a good friend
and a very religious man, said that Attarabulsi was concerned about
the propriety of tuition aid but saw the scholarship as a way to
keep his younger son from having to join an older brother in the
Libyan army.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach the Attarabulsis for comment were
unsuccessful. In his only comment, Suhel Attarabulsi denied to the
Deseret News of Salt Lake City that his father had sold his vote
for the tuition aid.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Ball, a member of the bid committee, said his worst concern
now was that ``people assume wrongly that we bought this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We won on the first ballot, on merit,'' Ball said. ``But
that's not the perception.''

CLINTON OFFERS STEEL PRODUCERS A TAX BREAK, BUT NO IMPORT LIMITS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ohio, Russia, Japan, Korea, Brazil)   By DAVID E. SANGER 
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House told Congress Thursday that
President Clinton would not yet limit imports of foreign steel to
the United States, despite the demands of steel unions and some
producers, but would take a range of lesser actions intended to aid
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to Congress submitted days after a deadline while
Clinton and his economic team debated the politically charged
issue, the White House said it would seek to extend a $300 million
tax break for steel producers. That may provide some modest relief
to the companies, but would be only of indirect help to the United
Steelworkers of America, the politically powerful union that had
demanded sharp limits on Russian, Japanese, Korean and Brazilian
steel that it said is being dumped in the American market.
</P>
<P>
   The report also warns Japan, the largest exporter of many types
of steel, that the government would begin a broad investigation
that could lead to tariffs on many types of Japanese steel if a
surge of exports did not abate. Japanese steel shipments increased
more than 400 percent in the first nine months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the administration stopped short of actually
beginning that legal process, called a Section 201 proceeding,
which many of the companies had urged in hopes of sending a
stronger message to Japan and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Thursday came after a sharp split in the
administration. Trade officials, led by Commerce Secretary William
Daley and the U.S. trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, had
urged tougher action.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin had expressed what he delicately
termed ``reservations'' about strong action, fearing it would send
a signal that the United States was shutting off its markets to
low-cost imports.
</P>
<P>
   The steel glut was caused in large part by the Asian economic
crisis, and encouraging exports by the Asian producers has been a
key element of the strategy to get their nations back on track. The
result, however, has been a surging trade deficit in the United
States, as inexpensive foreign goods flood into the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a constant balancing act,'' a senior Clinton
administration official said, ``between trying to help the industry
and the workers, without sending out a chilling message around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House tax proposal would essentially permit U.S. steel
producers to write off losses against taxes paid in the previous
five years, rather than against taxes the previous two years. The
industry would save about $300 million, the Treasury estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But that is a token amount compared with the losses caused by
low-cost steel. It is unlikely to end the debate over what kind of
actions Washington should take, especially if layoffs continue in
the steel industry.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments over what to do about steel have been the source
of several meetings at the White House involving Clinton, Vice
President Gore, Rubin and in some cases Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration found that its legal options were
limited. It could not impose quotas, which are illegal under World
Trade Organization rules. It was even reluctant to enter into
``voluntary trade restraint'' agreements, of the kind that used to
govern auto and machine-tool trade with Japan. Those agreements,
too, are now subject to challenge under international trading
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, members of the Congressional Steel Caucus have
urged the administration to negotiate voluntary restraint
agreements with foreign producers, arguing that no countries are
likely to challenge the accords in front of the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Steelworkers and its president, George Becker,
have gone further, urging outright quotas. They are powerful in
Washington, and neither Clinton nor Gore, who needs their support
in his bid for the Presidential nomination, wanted to alienate
them. The report to Congress says that Clinton will appoint a White
House official to speed ``trade adjustment assistance'' already
legislated for steel workers who have been laid off.

TEEN SAYS HE GOT IDEA FOR SEX WITH SISTER FROM FROM SPRINGER SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla.) (bl) 
By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A 15-year-old boy accused along with a younger brother
of sexually abusing his 8-year-old half-sister over the last three
years maintains that he got the idea from watching a show on incest
on ``The Jerry Springer Show,'' police say
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager and his 13-year-old brother, who lived with their
mother and half-sister in Hollywood, a coastal city of about
126,000 people between Miami and Fort Lauderdale, were arrested
Dec. 11, but news of the case did not surface until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood police began investigating after a teacher saw the
girl crying in school, and the girl told the teacher and a
counselor that she had been sexually abused.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by detectives, police said, the two boys
admitted to having had vaginal, oral and anal sex with the child.
The 15-year-old specifically said that he had had intercourse with
her at least 10 times since she was 5, and that the incidents
happened in the morning after their mother went to work and in the
afternoon before she came home.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Curt Navarro, who investigated the case, said: ``I
asked how did you learn this? He said very quickly, `I watched the
Jerry Springer Show.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, what has that got to do with this?'' the detective
continued. ``He said, `I watched a show on incest.' I said, you
mean sex between members of the same family? He said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Navarro added, ``He said it as if you were asking me to pass the
salt at the dinner table.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer's popular syndicated television talk show is known for
a confrontational formula that has stirred controversy for lewd
language and physical violence. Last year the show's producers
announced that all violence would be removed from the format, but
backed out of that pledge a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the shows' titles have included ``Dumped for Another
Woman,'' My Daughter Is a Teen Prostitute'' and ``I'm in a Bizarre
Love Triangle.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Shafran, a publicist for the show in Chicago, said
Springer knew of the accusations against the teen-agers in
Hollywood but was taping two shows a night and could not be
reached. Ms. Shafran called the show ``an easy target,'' but said
this was the most serious incident that it has been blamed for.
</P>
<P>
   She said that among the more than 1,600 shows that Springer has
done, one may have dealt with incest but only ``with consenting
adults,'' not children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had a show that is even remotely close to this
situation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But last April, one show's subject was ``I'm Pregnant by My
Brother.'' The show featured a 17-year-old girl who said she was
impregnated by her 16-year-old half-brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there anything about this relationship that strikes you as
wrong?'' Springer asked the girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Springer's final thought on incest in the show was: ``Boy and
girls who are brothers and sisters can be only that, brothers and
sister. They have to find their dates elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The two brothers have been charged with sexual battery, police
said. The older boy is being held in jail as an adult; the
13-year-old is being treated as a juvenile and has been released to
his father's custody.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys are considering whether to prosecute the
15-year-old as an adult, meaning he could face a maximum sentence
of 25 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Punishment for the younger brother would be decided by juvenile
court. Navarro said the girl remains with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   The detective said the two boys showed no emotion during his
questioning. ``It didn't bother them, didn't faze them, no signs
they were upset,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Navarro said that when he asked the mother about the boys'
demeanor, ``she said that is how they are.''

forever and ever,'' the White House warned on Thursday that if the
Senate calls witnesses to testify about President Clinton, it may
use every tool available to build his defense.
</P>
<P>
   The warning, which played to public impatience with the
proceedings here, reflected both political and legal strategy.
Politically, the White House was trying to persuade Senate
Republicans to accept its proposal for a swift trial without
witnesses that would be confined to the impeachment case presented
by Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But the warning also signaled that, if the proposal is rejected,
Clinton's lawyers will demand to interview prosecution witnesses
before they appear. They could also demand to see reams of
documents so far unavailable to the White House, Clinton's aides
said, and perhaps file legal motions challenging some testimony
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they open the proceeding up, both in terms of additional
areas and additional witnesses, it's impossible for anyone at this
point to say how it would be handled,'' said a senior White House
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He added, ``Right
now, since nothing's been resolved, everything's in play.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, insisted that the
Senate should not hear opening arguments before deciding whether to
call witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me suggest if they take that course that they would have
difficulty meeting the basic test of fairness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, White House aides had emphasized that the conduct of
the trial was largely a matter for senators to decide among
themselves. Thursday's more aggressive remarks seemed to stem from
growing concern in Clinton's camp that the Senate was headed for a
protracted trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with a small bipartisan group of senators on
Wednesday night, White House officials offered to forswear several
legal options _ like demanding to cross-examine the witnesses Starr
used to build his case _ in what it presented as a bold concession
intended to speed the trial. In exchange, it asked for a Senate
rule that no witnesses would be called and no new evidence admitted
during Clinton's trial.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides said that they heard no response on Thursday to
their proposal from Republican Senate leaders, as negotiations over
the conduct of the trial broke down in partisan rancor. Republicans
and Democrats agreed on Thursday evening to meet on Friday to
discuss calling witnesses and other unresolved issues of procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart called Starr's impeachment case ``the most prejudicial
record that could possibly exist.'' Nevertheless, he said, Clinton
was prepared to accept that case as the entire basis of his trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are accepting that record,'' Lockhart said, ``despite the
fact that we don't know all the information it's based on, despite
the fact that it's untested and not cross-examined, despite the
fact that we know exculpatory information was left out.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that it was in the nation's interest to expedite the
trial, he expressed confidence that Clinton's lawyers could win his
acquittal without cross-examining the witnesses that Starr
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   But, White House officials said, their offer did not mean they
would accept the interpretation given the record by Starr or House
Republicans, or even the facts it contained. That is, White House
lawyers would still be expected to challenge the accuracy of
testimony by particular witnesses to the grand jury as well as the
significance placed upon the testimony by Starr and the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal has benefits for the White House beyond shortening
the trial. If the Senate accepted the offer, Clinton would no
longer run the risk that some new evidence might be presented or
new allegations made against him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some independent experts saw the White House offer as a
dramatic, potentially risky move. ``It would be extremely rare, if
ever, that a criminal defense lawyer in a criminal case would agree
that hearsay testimony that had not been cross-examined would be
admissible,'' said Irvin Nathan, a criminal defense lawyer who is a
partner here with the firm of Arnold and Porter.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the White House was waiving the right to call
other witnesses to rebut that hearsay testimony. ``That would be
quite extraordinary, I would say to the point of nonexistent,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As they have for days, White House officials continued to insist
on Thursday that they could not develop, much less disclose, a
coherent defense strategy before knowing what kind of prosecution
the president would face. They remained silent on the question of
what witnesses they might call in response to any witnesses brought
by the House members conducting the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But they warned that if the Senate rejected Clinton's proposal,
the trial would be open-ended. ``Bringing witnesses in and not
stipulating to a record opens up a whole area of motions, discovery
and depositions,'' Lockhart said. ``And that takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House also says it would want to review evidence
accumulated by Starr that was not included in his referral to
Congress. Some of that evidence, White House aides argue, would be
exculpatory, but they will not insist on seeing it if the Senate
accepts their offer.
</P>
<P>
   And White House lawyers say that they should have the right to
depose witnesses before they testify to the senators, in order to
prepare for cross-examination. In a criminal trial, unlike civil
litigation, a defense lawyer normally does not have the right to
depose a witness, unless for reasons of illness or geography the
witness cannot attend the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But James J. Brosnahan, a San Francisco trial lawyer who
prosecuted Caspar Weinberger in the Iran-contra matter, said that
the Senate should bend to a White House request to depose
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not normal criminal procedure, but it could well be
normal impeachment procedure,'' he said. ``I think it's a
reasonable request.''

SENATE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS BEGIN AMID PARTISAN BICKERING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate opened impeachment proceedings Thursday
against the president of the United States for the first time in
nearly 131 years, with all 100 senators swearing an oath to deliver
``impartial justice'' in the trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a somber ceremony setting the stage for a trial that could
begin next Thursday, the senators were sworn in as jurors by Chief
Justice of the United States William Rehnquist shortly after he
took an oath to preside fairly over the trial in the Senate
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The swearing-in ceremony followed an equally serious event in
which the 13 Republican ``House managers,'' who will serve as
prosecutors in the trial, presented the Senate with two articles of
impeachment against Clinton. The articles were approved by the
House on Dec. 19 and stemmed from Clinton's attempts to cover up an
affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The solemnity Thursday gave way to partisan bickering among
Republicans and Democrats, who could not agree on trial guidelines
even as they were taking an oath to sit in unbiased judgment of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Following a day of negotiations, Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., agreed to a
bipartisan meeting of all senators Friday morning to figure out, as
Lott put it, ``just how we ought to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the best way to keep calm and cool and dignified is
to talk to one another,'' Lott said at a joint news conference with
Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   He called on the American people to be patient as the Senate
navigates the ``uncharted waters'' of the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats earlier had refused to attend a meeting requested
by Lott, who hoped to fashion consensus to start the trial next
Thursday and end it sometime between Feb. 5 and Feb. 12. Lott also
refused to give in to Democratic demands that a limited time be set
for the trial and that no witnesses be subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lott's plan, the House prosecution team led by Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and Clinton's White House
legal team would be given five days each to make arguments.
Senators would then submit questions to them through Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott's plan leaves the door open to calling witnesses on a
case-by-case basis after the initial arguments, primarily because
of Hyde's insistence that first-hand testimony from Lewinsky and up
to 10 other witnesses might be integral to his presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has informed Republican senators that he would like to
present evidence that was not made public in the House impeachment
hearings last month.
</P>
<P>
   Along with many Democrats and the White House, some Republicans
are wary about calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, expressed reservations about how it
would play with the American people to have some of the more
well-known witnesses testifying live over television from the
Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have serious questions about bringing Monica Lewinsky to the
floor of the Senate,'' Stevens told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., also questioned why Hyde would
want to call key witnesses in the Senate trial when he declined to
do so in the impeachment hearings his committee held last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't necessary then, why is it necessary now,''
Kennedy said, suggesting that Republicans are simply trying to
further embarrass Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart warned that
``all bets are off'' for a quick and orderly trial if Republicans
insist on calling witnesses in a case that he said contains no
evidence that warrants Clinton's removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can make a compelling case to the American public
that there is no constitutional or legal foundation to move forward
with removing the president,'' he said, adding that an ``open-ended
process'' would likely result in ``countless delays.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that Hyde's committee ``had their chance'' to call
witnesses in the House hearings ``and took a pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart called on the Senate leaders to set ``clear rules of
the road'' before actually beginning the trial, saying that failure
to do so would create ``an environment that is manifestly unfair to
the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot have a process that's fair to someone involved in
that process where the rules get made up as you go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort move the process along, Lockhart said the president
would be willing to stipulate to 7,000 pages of grand jury
testimony and other evidence compiled by independent counsel
Kenneth Starr in his investigation of the Lewinsky matter if Hyde
would drop his demand for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, called the proposal ``a step
in the right direction'' that would help shorten the list of
differences over what to allow into the trial. But she said members
should remain open to allowing witnesses to testify after each side
has a chance to present its case.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the confusion over how to carry on, the senators went
through the motions of beginning the trial process. They gathered
first to receive the articles of impeachment from the House in a
12-minute morning ceremony and then again in the afternoon for a
30-minute session in which Rehnquist, attired in his black judicial
robe, swore them in as jurors.
</P>
<P>
   As a Senate clerk called their names, each of the 100 senators
stood and said ``I do,'' when asked if they could pledge to do
``impartial justice'' in the case. Then each signed the Senate's
``book of oaths,'' normally reserved for recording the signatures
of new and re-elected lawmakers at each new Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Each lawmaker was allowed to keep the official black and silver
Senate pen he or she used, as a memento.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in his role as lead prosecutor, Hyde stood in the
Senate and read the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice
against Clinton. The 12 other Republican prosecutors appointed by
the House stood nearby.
</P>
<P>
   As Hyde ticked off an alleged pattern of lies and deceit he said
was aimed at covering up the president's illicit relationship with
Lewinsky, the senators sat grim-faced at their desks. Some took
notes, while others looked up occasionally into the visitor and
press galleries rimming the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution team entered the chamber in a single-file
procession after Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the president pro
tempore of the Senate, squawked at his colleagues to ``be in
order.'' But they were made to wait just inside the chamber door
while Lott and Daschle engaged in some last-minute haggling over
how the ceremony should proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Once that disagreement was settled, the 96-year-old Thurmond
instructed the Senate Sergeant at Arms James W. Ziglar to escort
Hyde and company to the well of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye. All persons are commanded to keep
silent, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives
is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of
impeachment against William Jefferson Clinton, president of the
United States,'' Ziglar read from a proclamation written in part by
the nation's founding fathers more than 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The historical precedent was set nearly 131 years ago, when the
Senate tried President Andrew Johnson in 1868 on three articles of
impeachment and acquitted him by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the nation was saddled with grave problems, and
the future of the country was in doubt. The Civil War had just
ended, not all southern states had rejoined the Union, and the
Republican-controlled Congress was upset with Jackson for his
Reconstruction policies. John was indicted on charges stemming from
his disagreements with Congress that fell well short of criminal
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The senators in the Clinton proceedings are being asked to
remove the president for lying under oath about an extramarital
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats and Republicans believe that it will be virtually
impossible to get the 67 votes needed to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lott reiterated Thursday that the Senate has a
constitutional obligation to carry through with a trial even though
the lawmakers charged with conducting it are wringing their hands
over how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Between ceremonies on the floor, Lott continued to hold
negotiations with Daschle, but many Democrats grew increasingly
angry at Lott for trying to accommodate Hyde's demand that he be
allowed to call witnesses. They saw Hyde's request as an attempt to
manage the trial proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Hyde is a fine human being, but I don't give a damn what
he thinks we should do. The next thing you know I'll be sitting in
a negotiating room and Ralph Reed will be sitting across the
table,'' Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., fumed to reporters. He was
referring to the former head of the Christian Coalition, a
Republican-based conservative group that has been intensely
critical of Clinton throughout his presidency.

SPORTS COLUMN: PLAYERS KNEW IT WAS TIME TO PROVIDE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having seen coal miners crawl back into the 36-inch seam at the
end of a strike, convinced they had been done dirty by the coal
operators, I have the tiniest bit of trouble seeing the basketball
players as an oppressed class.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen schoolteachers trudge back into the classroom at the
end of a strike, fearful they had been hammered by the school
board, I have the slightest difficulty brooding about our tall
friends.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I don't think the National Basketball
Association players want our condescension or our sympathy at the
end of the lockout dispute. I can hardly wait until they flaunt
their fur cloaks and their gold accessories at us, because then I
will know things are back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   The players deserve what they make, as talented performers. They
also have mouths to feed, just like coal miners and school
teachers, even though it may not look that way to the public.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear to me that the players got whacked that badly in
the settlement, which was ratified by the league's board of
governors Thursday. And as the son of two union pioneers, far be it
from me to tell the players they should have stood up to the big
bullies from ownership, and stayed out all year.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it would have been jolly fun to watch the look on Kindly
Uncle David's face when the players blew up the season and he had
to explain to his owners how he miscalculated the mood of the
workers. And wouldn't it have been fun seeing the sign ``Tractor
Pull Tonight'' out in front of Madison Square Garden?
</P>
<P>
   Good things have come out of this contract: Those madcap
impulsive owners have now been officially restrained from
overpaying the next wave of rookies.
</P>
<P>
   The players, through whatever group dynamics within their
association, decided they have a pretty good deal going, and why
wreck it. It says a lot about the million-dollar salaries that the
players can live with a pro-rated 50-game salary, but the 82-game
season is too long as it is.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the players had responsibilities. I'm sorry, but
that's a fact. Everybody laughed at Patrick Ewing for his bumbling
statements about the owners trying to take food out of his mouth,
but all of life is a struggle, and sometimes the most responsible
thing to do is pack a couple of sandwiches in the lunch bucket and
get back to the mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to get a fair deal,'' said Billy Hunter, the
executive director of the players' association. ``We don't need
ideologues telling us what to do. Players are going to be making
$80-90-100 million under this contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was sitting on the same dais as Stern and Russ Granik,
the deputy commissioner, after the governors had voted to bring the
slam dunk back to the deprived world. The class war, with its
whispers of racial attitudes between white owners and predominately
black labor, was now over, and these guys were acting like
respectful protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody in the media suggested that Hunter and the union had
been beaten down by the owners, Stern shook his head from side to
side, and said, ``Most of the board meeting was spent explaining to
the governors the differences between the old offer and what was
won by the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, to a small group, Stern said, ``The owners had their
limit at 53 percent, but it is my prerogative to suggest other
limits,'' which, ultimately came to 55 percent going to players'
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   True, Stern had been applauded by some players when he visited
their headquarters during the settlement, but when Hunter had paid
his respects to the owners after ratification Thursday, ``No
applause was asked for or offered,'' reported Stan Kasten of the
Atlanta Hawks, himself a gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   Does the imbalance of applause mean the players were craven
laborers who had caved in to the power structure? No, it probably
means the players have better manners than the owners.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of decency, it has been easy, during this six-month
lockout, to ridicule the players for their extravagances, as well
as the brash behavior of the younger set. I would also suggest that
the vast majority of NBA players are generously passing some of
their huge salaries to mothers and other family members and friends
who are somewhat better than hangers-on.
</P>
<P>
   I am hardly from the Ronald Reagan trickle-down school of
economics, but I do believe roofs are being built and groceries are
being bought with some of this money now being generated because
the players knew it was time to go back and take care of themselves
and their families.

 Oh No, He's A Son of The Boss  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Can a manager hire his son and pay him whatever he feels
like? My boss hired his son three years ago. He makes double my
salary in my old job, even though he has less experience than I
did, has no college degree and is very lazy. This bothers me a lot.
Do I have any cause for legal action? Or should I start looking for
a new job?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  Some companies have internal policies against nepotism
or hiring relatives. But there's no law against it, just as there's
no law against promoting inept people.
</P>
<P>
   So your boss can, in fact, hire his son, daughter, wife,
ex-wife, father-in-law, Great Aunt Agnes, or any family member he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   The law does place some restrictions on hiring practices:
Employers can't discriminate on the basis of race, gender,
religion, age, disability or, in some states like California,
sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't sound like the problem here. So drop any
thoughts of suing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, do some serious thinking about how much you like this
job. If you're generally happy, swallow your resentment of the
boss' son and focus on doing your own work like a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   But if this is one of a number of things bothering you _ or if
you see this as a sign that your future with the firm is limited _
it's probably best to start looking around for a new job.
</P>
<P>
   Maternity Leave
</P>
<P>
   Q: I run a small Colorado business with fewer than 25 employees.
Can you give me some guidance about setting up a maternity leave
policy for my staff? What am I required to provide by law? And what
do other employers typically provide?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let's start with the law. The U.S. Family &AMP; Medical Leave Act
requires most companies to give 12 weeks of unpaid maternity and
paternity leave.
</P>
<P>
   But the FMLA doesn't apply to firms with fewer than 50
employees. And unlike some other states like California, Colorado
doesn't have a state family leave law that covers small businesses
like yours.
</P>
<P>
   So there are really no legal requirements for you to give your
employees any maternity leave at all. Still, providing maternity or
paternity benefits is an excellent idea _ both for reasons of
compassion and as a way to attract and retain good employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Families &AMP; Work Institute in New York did a very thorough
survey last year of family-related benefits at firms with 100 or
more workers. It found:
</P>
<P>
   _58 percent offer 12 weeks of maternity leave, 25 percent
provide 13 to 26 weeks of maternity leave and 8 percent offer more
than 26 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _74 percent offer 12 weeks of paternity leave, 13 percent offer
13 to 26 weeks of paternity leave and 3 percent offer more than 26
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of WORKWAYS (95351 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  _About half of the employers provide full or partial pay during
maternity leave, often through their disability insurance program.
A much smaller number _ about one in 10 _ provide pay during
paternity leave. In addition to family leave, large companies today
offer benefits such as flexible or part-time schedules for new
parents; lactation rooms for nursing mothers; and financial help
with child care.
</P>
<P>
   As a very small business, you obviously can't roll out the array
of pricey services that IBM or Hewlett-Packard can.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some low-cost benefits you &LR;  can  &LR; provide that
might make a big difference in your employees' lives.
</P>
<P>
   You can allow new parents to return to work on a gradual basis,
such as working part time for a few months. You can create a
culture where people are truly free to adopt flexible schedules,
such as four 10-hour days. You can offer flexible spending
accounts, where employees may set aside pretax dollars for child
care.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to your staff to find out what's important to them. And
administer your new policies uniformly, so employees don't feel
that you're playing favorites by helping some people more than
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you give, don't plan on taking it away later,'' said
Mark Agnew, a benefits consultant with Watson Wyatt in San
Francisco. ``Start small, see if it's appreciated, and then add
on.''

   Overtime Blues
</P>
<P>
   Q: My son and his girlfriend work for a successful San Francisco
restaurateur and caterer who routinely assigns his employees to
16-hour days without a penny of overtime. The workers are afraid to
complain because he has a horrible temper and they don't want to
lose their jobs. Is there a way they could bring an end to this
despicably greedy practice without losing their jobs?
</P>
<P>
   A: Are you sure your son's schedule really fits the legal
definition of overtime?
</P>
<P>
   Both California law and federal law currently define overtime as
more than 40 hours in one week. So it's possible that your son
could be putting in 16-hour shifts without incurring overtime pay,
as long as those shifts don't add up to more than 40 hours in one
week.
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume, just for argument's sake, that your son and his
friends &LR;  are  &LR; illegally being cheated out of their overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of WORKWAYS (95351 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Your son could file a claim for unpaid overtime with the
California Labor Commissioner at (415) 557-7878 or the U.S.
Department of Labor at (415) 744-5590.
</P>
<P>
   California law prohibits employers from firing or penalizing
workers who have filed wage claims. So theoretically, if the boss
fired your son in retaliation, he would have the basis for a pretty
strong wrongful termination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a lot of ways that employers can make life
miserable for whistle-blowing workers without firing them outright.
I can understand how your son would be reluctant to go on record
demanding his rights.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Shiu, an attorney with the Employment Law Center in San
Francisco, suggests that your son and his friends all file wage
claims together. Or they could band together and form a union.
Either way, it would be harder for the boss to single out one
``troublemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If a bunch of people are willing to go into this en masse,
there's strength in numbers,'' Shiu said.

DEAL TO END BUSING PLAN FOR ST. LOUIS MAY BE NEAR
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The St. Louis school system, which has the country's largest
busing program, may soon be released from its long-standing
court-ordered desegregation plan.
</P>
<P>
   After a long, tortuous negotiation process, a tentative
agreement reached Wednesday would end 15 years of court-ordered
desegregation under which about 13,000 black inner-city students
from the 59,000-student district are voluntarily bused each year to
predominantly white suburban schools.
</P>
<P>
   Minnie Lidell, a parent who was the lead plaintiff in a 1972
lawsuit that led to the court-ordered desegregation plan, expressed
optimism about the settlement. ``I think we have a plan in place
where, if all sides live up to their end of the deal, I think we
can see some real change,'' she said. ``We have a chance to improve
the quality of education in St. Louis for all kids, and that was
our original goal when we started all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accused the district of segregating its schools by
race. Beyond remedying the racial disparity, the desegregation plan
spurred some improvement in city schools, including renovation of
buildings and the reduction of class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis settlement comes as a wave of cities across the
country seek to be released from court-ordered busing programs. In
recent years, Indianapolis, Kansas City, Mo., Denver, Oklahoma
City, Norfolk, Va., Wilmington, Del., Nashville and Cleveland, have
resolved their desegregation cases.
</P>
<P>
   But several aspects set the St. Louis settlement apart from
others.
</P>
<P>
   For one, it would not so much discontinue busing as change the
way it would be financed.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents and some administrators in both the city and
suburban schools would like busing to continue, arguing that it
gives black city students a choice of where to be educated and
gives city schools an incentive to compete for those students who
can attend the suburban schools.
</P>
<P>
   A popular part of the desegregation program is a small-scale
busing plan under which about 1,300 white students from the
suburban counties can attend specialized magnet schools in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   But several years ago, Missouri, which pays the St. Louis
schools $70 million a year to run the busing program, went to court
to try to get the desegregation order lifted so state taxpayers
would no longer have to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Wednesday's tentative agreement, which is subject
to the approval of U.S. District Court Judge Stephen Limbaugh and
the school boards of the participating districts, and a bill passed
by the state Legislature last year, the state would reduce its
obligation to $40 million. The proposal calls for most of the
remaining money _ about $23 million _ to come from an increase of
the city sales tax by two-thirds of one cent.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the agreement is finalized depends on whether city
voters approve the tax increase in a ballot scheduled for Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all contingent on the passage of a sales tax, which I
think is going to be a tough job,'' said Dr. Cleveland Hammonds
Jr., the superintendent of the St. Louis school district.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would maintain the current busing situation for at
least three years and would allow students already being bused the
option of completing their education in the suburban schools.
</P>
<P>
   After three years, the 15 participating school districts in St.
Louis County would have the option to stop accepting new bused
students, although Dr. Jere Hochman, superintendent of the Parkway
School District, which receives 3,000 bused students, said he
believed most of the districts would retain the program as long as
they continue to receive enough money for transportation and other
costs.
</P>
<P>
   All the parties had some interest in reaching this week's
settlement. The state would save money. The suburban school
districts would get the freedom to discontinue busing.
</P>
<P>
   While the city schools would receive about $7 million less for
the busing program, Kenneth Brostron, a lawyer for the school
district, said the benefit of being freed from the cumbersome court
order would make up for it. Now, he said, many decisions about
staffing ratios and programs are subject to approval of the judge.
</P>
<P>
   And as for the plaintiffs in the original lawsuit, they would
receive commitments that the city school district would ``provide
for a lot of things to make the schools better,'' said William
Taylor, the lead lawyer representing the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the agreement included provisions that would provide
more teacher training, toughen the district's approach to failing
schools and would allow students the chance to transfer from a
failing school.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even before Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
appeared as a berobed outsider to preside at the Senate trial of
President Clinton, there was an unscripted moment that was no less
spectacular: An informal and thoroughly anxious floor gathering of
dozens of Senators suddenly evolved, scrambling in an ad hoc grasp
at last-minute bipartisanship and common agreement in the well of
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 minutes, the debating chamber resembled a political
commodities pit, with lawmakers ringing their leaders three and
four deep to speak without floor microphones, to listen, to smile,
to point (only one in obvious anger). Gavel-free, beyond the gaze
of television lenses, the senators leaned in to partake shoulder to
shoulder in an informal tableau that seemed to personify the
open-faced worry and wonderment that this day offered the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was stirring,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, as if he
had happily spied an aberrant crocus amid the wintry gray scene of
presidential impeachment. But two hours later, the senator's
exultation was dashed and seemed premature, at best; the scrum of
bipartisan give and take stood mainly as a tease of what might have
been.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans announced, but then postponed, plans to immediately
push through their own plan for a trial lasting into February,
replete with potential witnesses and freighted with Democratic
objections. Confusion suddenly reigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like the House,'' said the Senate newcomer, Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y., as he darted from the high ceremonies of
impeachment to the hard politics of a Democratic caucus. Schumer
was a member of the rancorous House Judiciary Committee that
drafted the impeachment articles against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hyde has rolled Lott,'' one angry Democrat alleged beyond the
debating chamber, contending Rep. Henry Hyde and the other House
Republican prosecutors of the impeachment trial were prevailing
through conservative political pressures on Sen. Trent Lott, the
Republican majority leader. ``Now the White House will have no
choice but to lawyer this thing out,'' he said, warning of a drawn
out battle.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans insisted that the Democrats were the first
to blindly close ranks in partisanship in helping the White House
fight all compromise ideas to call witnesses. Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., angrily said his party was not ``going to sit and watch all
Democrats go one way and then say the Republicans are partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators sensed the risk of their appearing to flail before the
nation in a partisan riptide. ``We want to give it another
effort,'' Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, finally
announced as he appeared late in the day side by side with Lott.
They agreed to another bi-partisan attempt Friday morning to see if
a compromise trial plan can somehow be salvaged in a mass caucus of
the Senate jury.
</P>
<P>
   Lott expressed the Senate's hope for a fresh day. ``Keep calm
and cool and dignified,'' he said even as Daschle estimated the
Republicans were still unlikely to win over the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, anxiously summarized the far from
settled issue: ``The question is can we get to the point where
people can really think as jurors rather than as Republicans or
Democrats?''
</P>
<P>
   For all the tribulation beyond the chamber, Rehnquist arrived
for a swearing-in ceremony that was remarkable less for
Constitutional pomp than the near mournful hush that engulfed the
chamber. The very image of the judge occupying the Senate president
pro tem's chair was every bit as stunning to chamber habitues as
the moment when he administered the mass oath to the lawmakers as a
100-member jury.
</P>
<P>
   As Democratic leader in the Senate, Daschle looked dumbfounded
at what was unfolding before him: The trial of his president and
party leader was actually coming to pass. Clinton's fate was on the
line. Now sworn as a juror, Daschle, a lawmaker who relishes the
intricacies of the usual Senate business, sat staring like a
mourner at a wake.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, senators pocketed souvenir pens after firmly vowing
``impartial justice'' and signing the Senate jurors book for
history as Rehnquist opened a trial that had no clear procedures or
calendar in place.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier, no less doleful ceremony, Hyde and the 12 other
Republican trial managers were announced to the Senate chamber as
they arrived to read out the charges that Clinton ``has undermined
the integrity of his office'' and merits nothing less than
banishment from office. But even as the House visitors arrived,
Lott and Daschle and a clutch of other lawmakers were blocking the
entry aisle in another cross-party discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The senators ignored the representatives who had no choice but
to wait as the senators talked. Hyde stood patient and silent, and
his colleagues waiting mutely in line. The opening ceremony of the
impeachment trial was thus delayed a few minutes, as if in tacit
display that, for all the eagerness of the accusers from the House,
the fate of William Jefferson Clinton was now the Senate's to
settle, one way or another.

 New Face in Company Deck  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
You've heard of the chief executive officer, the chief financial
officer and probably even the chief technology officer. Now there's
one more suit in the executive suite _ the chief marketing officer.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when getting consumers' attention is harder than ever,
a growing number of businesses _ from Delta Airlines to AT&AMP;T, which
named its first CMO yesterday _ are moving marketing into the ranks
of their top executives.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the rise of the chief marketing officer, or CMO, is
nothing more than title inflation for what used to be called the
executive vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   But companies that have named CMOs argue that the job and the
title reflect the fact that consumers face more choices than ever,
and not just what products they buy, but how and where they buy
them. In many cases, there really isn't a whole lot of difference
between one company's product and another, which makes marketing
one of the company's most important jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Delta and AT&AMP;T, CMOs work at Coca-Cola, Blockbuster
video, Taco Bell, the NBA and apparel-maker Levi Strauss. Like the
CFO and CTO, the CMO usually reports to the president or chief
executive and generally earns considerably more than a marketing
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you have a chief marketing officer?'' asks Frederick
Reid, a former Lufthansa executive who became Delta Airlines' first
CMO in June. ``Because more and more things are being treated as a
commodity. If you want a sustainable competitive advantage, you
need branding.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, executives like Reid see that their competitors
are using many of the same productivity tools, technologies and
people-management strategies. Everybody has been through TQM (Total
Quality Management). Everybody is faster and more efficient. But
one way companies still can differentiate themselves is by creating
a strong brand name.
</P>
<P>
   Branding and marketing have always been important, especially
for companies that sell directly to consumers. Coca-Cola created
the CMO title in 1993, but for years, it was one of the only
big-brand companies to have one. What's changed? Some say very
little.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senior vice president of marketing and CMO _ frankly, I
think those two titles are interchangeable. They're both the top
marketing jobs in a company,'' said Tom Rosenwald, a partner and
director at the executive-search firm Heidrick &AMP; Struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these people, regardless of title, report to the president
or CEO. So whether you're a vice president or a chief whatever
officer, the reporting relationship is the same,'' said Emily
Elliot, a human-resources consultant in Walnut Creek.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the CMO title is a recruiting tool in a booming
economy, where competition for top talent is stiff. Depending on
the company's size, marketing emphasis and organizational
structure, the CMO might pull down between $200,000 and $500,000,
compared with $150,000 to $400,000 for a vice president of
marketing, according to Heidrick &AMP; Struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's common to have an executive vice president of marketing
who won't talk to a recruiter without talking about a CMO
position,'' said Jim Notarnicola, who became Blockbuster's first
CMO in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than just a title, according to Notarnicola and
other CMO practitioners. As companies grow larger, more
international and more complex, and as the marketplace gets more
crowded, it's harder to ensure that the corporate message is clear,
unified and is getting to the right place.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your advertising people are selling something different
from your sales people and your investor-relations people, the
marketplace becomes confused,'' said Smooch Reynolds, an executive
recruiter who specializes in marketing talent. ``If you create a
CMO, it puts one person in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of CMO08 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Adding a CMO also is a way of signaling that marketing is a
priority _ that the top marketing executive is on par with the
finance or technology chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chief title signifies that those are functions the company
considers to be core,'' Notarnicola said.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing is the new religion at a growing number of companies
because it has advanced beyond drawing up an ad campaign,
public-relations strategy or deciding on a package design. New
database software allows businesses to better identify their best
customers and, the theory goes, sell more to them.
</P>
<P>
   Apparel-maker Levi Strauss made Gordon Shank, a 24-year-company
veteran, its first CMO a little over seven months ago as part of
its transition from a marketing and manufacturing company to one
where ``marketing is the most important function we have,'' Shank
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever's smart enough to figure out who their best customers
are, what their needs are and what their buying patterns are like _
and then starts to build a dialogue with them _ that company is
going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing has grown in importance even at high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
   Personal computer-maker Gateway hired Anil Arora, a former
Pillsbury executive, as its CMO in June. In March, software-maker
Vantive added its first CMO, Phillip Dunkelberger, former chief
executive at Pretty Good Privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of your customer relationships is becoming more
important than the quality or functionality of the product,
delivery or service of that product,'' said Promod Haque, general
partner at Norwest Venture Partners, which helped finance Vantive.
``Technology companies are realizing that if you have a satisfied
customer, you can sell a lot of different products to that
customer.''
</P>
<P>
   KPMG, the giant audit, tax and consulting firm, hired its first
CMO in September 1997 as part of an attempt to unify marketing for
its three service lines across the 150-plus countries where it
operates. Tim Pearson, the CMO, is the only member of the firm
besides the chairman and deputy chairman who attends both the
executive committee and the board meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the responsibility for marketing is at the absolute,
utmost top levels of the firm, versus having marketing as a
department reporting to operations or some other group,'' Pearson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some CMOs have responsibilities that extend beyond traditional
marketing. At Delta, Reid's job includes inventory management,
which in the airline business means allocating and pricing seats,
scheduling flights and even recommending when the company needs to
spend $150 million on another aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   At Eastman Kodak, CMO Carl Gustin oversees functions such as
business research, some aspects of training and human resources,
Kodak's Internet site, and strategic alliances with companies such
as Intel or Adobe. Besides that, he has responsibility for
marketing of all of Kodak's products _ from film to medical-imaging
technologies _ around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this doesn't become a fad title,'' said Gustin, who
became CMO in August. ``At some companies, there's probably no
difference whatsoever between the senior or executive vice
president of marketing and the CMO.''

 Liquid Audio to Collaborate With Diamond  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Hoping to catch the growing Internet music wave, digital music
pioneer Liquid Audio Inc. will allow songs encoded in its own
proprietary format to be played on a competing portable MP3 music
player made by Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas yesterday, Diamond
Multimedia unveiled new software that allows its new Rio PMP300
player to download music encoded in Liquid Audio's Liquid Tracks
format.
</P>
<P>
   The move will give Redwood City's Liquid Audio, which has spent
two years trying to push its technology as the digital music format
of the future, an important gateway into the world of MP3s, a
format that has gained far wider grassroots popularity on the
Internet in just one year.
</P>
<P>
   And the deal gives Diamond Multimedia of San Jose a wider source
of popular, legal songs from artists like Marilyn Manson to help
market its new Rio, part of a nascent technological music format
that the recording industry fears will cut into their sales.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  One analyst believes Liquid Audio realized that it was time
to jump on the bandwagon. ``They've capitulated,'' said Mark
Hardie, entertainment industry analyst with Forrester Research Inc.
of Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liquid Audio has acknowledged they are not the arbitrators of
what should be the format for the industry and simply one of the
players that will move digital distribution along.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rio and other similar portable devices that can play
MP3-formatted music have shaken the worldwide recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   MP3 is a technology that can copy and compress audio files, like
music from CDs, so it can be easily stored on a personal computer
and downloaded off the Internet. Liquid Audio's Liquid Tracks
technology also compresses audio files, but it also can encode them
to prevent piracy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the legally MP3 formatted songs available on the
Internet are by little-known artists. Most of the songs of
well-known recording artists that are posted by MP3 fans on the Net
are illegal copies, according to the Recording Industry Association
of America.
</P>
<P>
   The recording industry trade group lost a bid in November to
gain a court restraining order to block sales of the Rio.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest recording companies have since formed a committee
called the Secure Digital Music Initiative to study how best to
prevent pirating and control Internet music distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid Audio spokesman Bill Woods said the Rio and MP3s are
pushing the recording industry toward selling music on the Internet
faster than they would have otherwise. But he said Liquid Audio's
collaboration with Diamond is not a concession that MP3 will be the
digital music standard used in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Woods maintains that Liquid Audio is part of the recording
industry's secure music initiative and hopes Liquid Tracks still
could become part of whatever standards the recording industry
group chooses.
</P>
<P>
   Liquid Audio hopes to work out similar deals to have other MP3
players coming on the market to also play songs encoded in its
format, he noted.

LABOR DEAL IMPROVES ODDS OF KEEPING NETS' CORE INTACT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the time has come for the Nets to experience prosperity.
Equipped with a talented roster, in the possession of new,
philanthropic ownership, and outfitted with a fresh,
state-of-the-art practice facility, the long-suffering franchise
received more good news Thursday when the National Basketball
Association's new collective bargaining agreement was ratified.
</P>
<P>
   While the Board of Governors' unanimous acceptance of the deal
signifies that all teams were pleased with the terms, the Nets are
one of a handful of clubs with extra reason to celebrate. Like the
Minnesota Timberwolves, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Cleveland
Cavaliers, the Nets have a nucleus of exciting young players that
would have been almost impossible to keep together under the former
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But because individual salaries will now be capped for at least
the next six years, the team's chances of keeping center Jayson
Williams, guard Kerry Kittles and the swingman Keith Van Horn for
several years have gone from so-so to very good. With limited
maximum salaries, no competitor will be able to outbid the Nets for
those players, and the Nets will not have to pay the roughly $300
million it might have taken to retain their services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any team that truly wants to be significant in the NBA has to
be together for a period of time,'' Coach John Calipari of the Nets
said. ``If you look at Utah, Indiana and Chicago, the core of their
teams have been together for seven, eight years, and that's why
they're the best three teams in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, with its All-Star forward, Kevin Garnett, having
signed a six-year, $126 million contract in 1997, had become the
greatest example of how uncontrolled salaries could destroy a
potential championship contender well before maturation. It would
have been incredibly difficult, and perhaps financially perilous,
for the Timberwolves to keep the All-Stars Stephon Marbury and Tom
Gugliotta with Garnett making so much money. But under the new
agreement, they have a legitimate chance to sign all three without
ruining themselves economically.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers would probably have been forced to exceed Shaquille
O'Neal's seven-year, $120 million contract to re-sign Kobe Bryant
either this year or next _ a reality that might have put a strain
on the team's chemistry _ but now Bryant can earn no more than $87
million over seven years. And competing teams can offer him no more
than a six-year, $67.5 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland last season, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, Derek Anderson,
Brevin Knight and Cedric Henderson brightened the future of the
Cavaliers by making the all-rookie team, and now the Cavs have a
chance to keep them around All-Star Shawn Kemp for the several
years.
</P>
<P>
   The priority for the Nets is to re-sign the charismatic
Williams, who is among the league's most coveted free agents. While
Williams' well-known desire to stay in New Jersey gave the Nets the
advantage all along, Seattle, Phoenix, Detroit and Charlotte were
ready to tempt him with hefty offers that might have surpassed what
the Nets wanted to pay. But now those clubs cannot push Williams'
market value past $83 million over six years, while, because of the
Larry Bird exception, the Nets can pay Williams nearly $106 million
over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the former rules, it might have taken at least that much
money to get him back. Williams, who has been outspoken about
keeping the Nets' nucleus intact, said he did not mind making a
little less money. ``I think I lost a lot of money on this, but how
much does one person need?'' he said in reference to the new labor
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn, who could have become the game's highest-paid player
next summer, agreed with Williams. ``If the most I can make is x
amount of dollars, that's fine,'' said Van Horn, a second-year
forward. ``I'm not trying to break the bank. Once you get over a
certain amount of money, there's not a whole lot of difference.''
</P>
<P>
   With David Falk, the powerful agent, representing him, Van Horn
would have obliterated the bank as a free agent. While whispers of
his becoming the league's first $200 million man were overstated,
he probably would have commanded about $150 million on the open
market. Now, he will have to settle for about half that.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kittles, another Falk client, has one year remaining on
his contract, the Nets could extend his deal when the league allows
the free-agent bidding to begin on Jan. 18. A team executive said
the Nets wanted to sign the shooting guard to a long-term deal but
did not feel the urgency to do it before the season began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that keeps our team together, I'm happy about,''
Calipari said of the long-term implications of the new labor
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Williams, Kittles and Van Horn could enable the Nets to
be one of, and remain among, the elite NBA teams for the next
decade.

 MCI May Join the Hunt for AirTouch  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
MCI WorldCom is expected to become the third bidder for AirTouch
Communications Inc., even though such an acquisition would run
counter to MCI's stated strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard J. Ebbers, MCI's chairman and CEO, has said he doesn't
want to get into cellular, doesn't want to dilute his company's
earnings and doesn't want to focus on the residential market.
Acquiring San Francisco's AirTouch would do all those things.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say that if Mississippi's MCI wants to be a player
in the future, when customers get all their telecommunications
needs from a single provider, MCI must get into wireless.
</P>
<P>
   MCI's bid could be as much as $55 billion, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic has reportedly offered $45 billion for AirTouch,
and Vodafone Group of Britain has offered $55 billion. All three
offers reportedly would be stock swaps.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts considered an MCI/AirTouch pairing unlikely, since
MCI would be paying a high price for just half a nationwide
network. AirTouch has service in 25 states and MCI does not have
its own wireless network. The company would still have to do
another acquisition to get a national ``footprint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For Bernie Ebbers to go against all three of his basic tenets
and only get half a footprint in return doesn't make sense,'' said
Timothy O'Neil with SoundView Financial Group.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil said he expects MCI, which focuses on the business
market, to get into wireless, but he thinks the company will
eventually buy Nextel Communications, the national wireless carrier
geared toward business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Even if MCI comes in with a high offer, it's unlikely that the
company will go much beyond it &UR;  &LR; because of the amount of
``goodwill'' the company will have to write off.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwill is the difference between the book value of the company
and the price paid for it. Both MCI and Bell Atlantic would have to
write off the goodwill, which could be $35 billion, and that would
dilute earnings for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe AirTouch solves WorldCom's domestic U.S.
issues with respect to wireless nearly well enough to be worth
suffering the dilution,'' said Charles DiSanza, with Gerard Klauer
Mattison in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It also wouldn't do much for AirTouch. Since MCI has no wireless
network, AirTouch would not gain market share.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts speculated that Vodafone is most likely to emerge as
the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone would not suffer the same dilution of earnings from
goodwill, in part because AirTouch trades at a much lower cash-flow
ratio than Vodafone. Also, unlike MCI or Bell Atlantic, Vodafone's
high-flying stock price is based less on earnings and more on
speculation about the company's future. So Vodafone may be in a
better position to offer a higher price for AirTouch, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   AirTouch and Vodafone would also be better fit. AirTouch would
give Vodafone a U.S. presence plus licenses in Spain, Germany and
Italy, adding to Vodafone's strong presence in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``AirTouch and Vodafone would be a wireless Coca-Cola, a huge
powerhouse,'' said Kevin Roe of ABN AMRO. ``The synergies are
fantastic, they are willing to pay a higher (price) and they are
able to be aggressive in their bid without changing the investment
thesis of Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
   But privately, sources say AirTouch executives are concerned
about Vodafone's stock. The company, which is rumored to be
offering about $90 a share, has seen its own stock price soar more
than 144 percent over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   AirTouch executives are said to be worried about what might
happen to Vodafone's inflated stock once a merger is announced.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone stock ``has taken such a quick run that there's some
concern on the part of shareholders that it's overvalued and that
once they get AirTouch, the price would come back down,'' said
Jennifer Murtaugh, an analyst with Everen Securities in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mahoney, whose AIM Global Telecom Fund owns about
500,000 AirTouch shares, said the market's volatility is a concern,
but he still thinks a Vodafone/AirTouch pairing has the best chance
for success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty happy with a $90 offer or slightly better from
Vodafone,'' said Mahoney, who also owns 1.8 million shares of
Vodafone. ``I do not expect Bell Atlantic to top that offer because
the dilution is so severe. The market was already punishing Bell
when they offered $75. My expectation is that Vodafone will win the
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Mahoney said, MCI could beat out Vodafone if it makes a
a stock-and-cash offer. If MCI offered $20 per share in cash on top
of $70 in stock, Mahoney said, he could see AirTouch leaping at
that offer.
</P>
<P>
   The company with the most to gain _ or lose _ is Bell Atlantic,
which desperately needs AirTouch's domestic wireless licenses to be
a national player. Currently, it has cellular operations only on
the East Coast. Without AirTouch, analysts said, Bell Atlantic can
forget about competing against AT&AMP;T Corp. or Sprint PCS. Those
national players are moving to a single-rate nationwide,
eliminating roaming charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell Atlantic absolutely has to get AirTouch ... and they'll
have to pay an advanced premium for it,'' said Andrew Cole, senior
manager at Renaissance Worldwide, a telecommunications consulting
firm. Cole said he expects to see Bell Atlantic raise its bid to
about $55 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect they'll go the last mile to get this acquisition,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bell Atlantic shareholders said they think the company will
try to convince AirTouch board members that it would be a better
long-term partner because the combined company would be the
nation's largest cellular company.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential bidders also lurk in the shadows. Both BellSouth
Corp. and Germany's Mannesmann AG have been mentioned as having
interest in AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   But Mannesmann, which has a market value less than AirTouch, may
not be able to afford the wireless carrier. And BellSouth faces the
same earnings-dilution problems associated with a merger.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate decision will be made by AirTouch's 11 board
members, who include AirTouch chief executive Sam Ginn and two
other company executives, Gap Chairman Donald Fisher and former
U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.
</P>
<P>
   One board member, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
the board has not come to any decision and is wrestling with the
proposals on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's complicated because there are pros and cons to all the
possibilities,'' the board member said, adding that the members
want to do what's best for ``the shareholders and employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Most industry watchers agree that Ginn and the other board
members are likely to do not only what's best financially, but what
is most likely to enhance the success of AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board has to ask itself `What are the long-term
synergies?' Does Sam Ginn want AirTouch to be part of a diversified
telecommunications company or part of a global wireless player?''
said Roe of ABN AMRO.

 Big Merger Of Exchanges Called Off  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman, Arthur M. Louis and Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Chicago Board Options Exchange called off its pending merger
with the Pacific Exchange yesterday, citing the drain on its
resources caused by a U.S. Justice Department antitrust probe of
the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt move left San Francisco's Pacific Exchange, the
third-ranking options exchange, in a lurch. It faces growing
competition from larger, better-financed exchanges as well as
threats from emerging electronic rivals at a time when it must
spend large sums to update its technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Exchange, the largest U.S. options trading
organization, said it acted because the Justice Department inquiry
would have delayed the merger until mid-1999, about six months
behind schedule, just as the exchange faces growing competitive
threats from computer-based options trading systems.
</P>
<P>
   On both the Pacific and Chicago exchanges, traders buy and sell
stock options by shouting at each other across the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``CBOE's decision to terminate discussions with (the Pacific
Exchange) was made strictly on the basis of our available time and
resources,'' CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive William Brodsky said
in a release.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Exchange spokesman Dale Carlson said the exchange's
board of governors will meet in the next few days to consider its
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we felt a merger between the Pacific Exchange and
the CBOE made a world of sense,'' Carlson said. ``We're going to
have to sit down with our board and sort all of this out.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial experts predicted that the 117-year-old Pacific
Exchange will be forced to find another partner, such as Nasdaq,
the computer-based stock trading system that ranks just behind the
New York Stock Exchange in its share of U.S. stock trading. Nasdaq
recently acquired the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Size and capital are becoming more and more important facts
driving the marketplace,'' said Ken Fitzsimmons, director of
equities at BancBoston Robertson Stephens. ``Maybe the Pacific
Exchange will become part of Nasdaq.''
</P>
<P>
   The CBOE and the Pacific Exchange received ``lengthy and
comprehensive requests for detailed information'' about their
proposed merger December 23, the Pacific Exchange told its members
several days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department's
antitrust division in Washington, D.C., said federal law requires
the department to investigate mergers of a certain size. The
department is charged with determining whether such transactions
will unduly hurt competition.
</P>
<P>
   CBOE spokeswoman Carol Kennedy said the exchange is facing
several major issues, including conversion to decimal-based options
pricing and the threat posed by a new competitor _ the
all-electronic options exchange being formed by Palo Alto's ETrade
Group and other brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department investigation was ``very daunting in
terms of time,'' requiring an estimated six months to comply, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the two exchanges agreed to combine in July, they praised
the deal as an unbeatable combination that would trade options on
more than 1,700 stocks and account for about 65 percent of U.S.
options trading.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, options, which give holders rights to buy or
sell stock at a set price by a certain date, have been growing far
faster than stock trading on the Pacific Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would have required approval of two-thirds of the
Pacific Exchange's approximately 550 members.
</P>
<P>
   Approval was expected but not certain, because many trading of
many options would have moved to Chicago, costing the Pacific
Exchange business.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the exchange's 400 employees would have lost jobs after
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The two exchanges had planned to sell or spin off the Pacific
Exchange's stock trading operations, which have been losing money
in recent years. The stock operations could be attractive to a
buyer because it is switching to an advanced electronic stock
trading system called OptiMark.

<P>
   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia _ Colombia's first steps toward
peace talks aimed at ending its civil war stumbled Thursday as the
commander of the largest rebel group did not appear at an opening
ceremony with President Andres Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   The commander, Manuel Marulanda, has not appeared in public
since his movement began in 1964. Rebel leaders in attendance said
he had stayed away because he had received death threats.
</P>
<P>
   They added that he had never explicitly said he would appear at
the gathering, which had become the main event animating the
country and this town of 45,000 peasants.
</P>
<P>
   Flying here from Bogota, the capital, Pastrana sat alone at a
table on a stage decked with the colors of the Colombian flag and
with smaller flags strung by the insurgents reading, ``Opening
Paths to a New Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   At the foot of the stage armed presidential bodyguards stood
shoulder-to-shoulder with rebels. Above the gathering, overlooking
the town's main square, guerrilla sharpshooters watched from
windows, rooftops and the church belfry.
</P>
<P>
   The seat for the 68-year-old Marulanda, who is commonly known as
Sureshot, was left empty at the president's side.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old president, inaugurated just five months ago, has
made peace with the rebels a priority of his administration. The
government evacuated security forces from a vast swatch of
southeastern Colombia two months ago to allow the talks to proceed.
The failure of the rebel leader to appear was seen by many as an
embarrassing setback for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pastrana is like the bride all dressed up and left at the
altar,'' said the governor of the Valle del Cauca, Gustavo Alvarez
Gardeazabal. He was there as a guest of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's unofficial war has claimed more than 35,000 lives in
the last decade alone, and displaced more than 1.2 million
Colombians from their rural homes. The rebels of the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the world's largest and oldest
Marxist insurgency, have grown in strength over the last two years,
defeating government forces in a series of humiliating attacks on
military and police installations.
</P>
<P>
   It was only as an announcer introduced Pastrana and then three
FARC leaders that the crowd of dignitaries who had traveled here
from around South America realized that Marulanda was absent.
Pastrana, dressed in a white knit shirt, held his head in his hands
as he received word that the rebel chief's speech would be read by
one of his lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence of Manuel Marulanda today cannot be a reason for
not installing the table of dialogue that should lead us to peace
talks,'' the president said later.
</P>
<P>
   ``As head of state,'' he said, ``I am here to express the voice
of a country that wants peace, that seeks social justice and is
ready to carry out politics as an exercise of the common good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombia cannot go on divided into three irreconcilable
countries, where one country kills, the other dies, and a third,
horrified, scratches its head and shuts its eyes,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   Marulanda's speech, read by the commander of FARC's Southern
Bloc, Joaquin Gomez, denounced what the rebel chief called
betrayals of attempts at peace by the Colombian government in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, the rebel said, has created two new mobile
counter-guerrilla battalions, one financed by the United States,
``to maintain a ring around the secretariat'' under the guise of
fighting drug trafficking. In addition, he said, the president is
creating an American-backed intelligence unit in southeastern
Colombia with equipment that can vastly multiply the government's
information about guerrilla troop movements.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels also criticized the current American infusion of
weaponry and money into Colombia, which is slated to climb to $289
million this year from $89 million last year. Washington contends
the aid is geared only toward eliminating drug crops and operations
in areas under rebel control.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebel group called the anti-drug fight ``another war
horse used by some governments to hide the true ends of their
counter-insurgency actions, to prevent the kinds of changes that
the majority is demanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Four delegates Pastrana named earlier this week met briefly with
the three FARC delegates here Thursday, and the two sides agreed to
continue talks in Machaca, 50 miles east of here, on Saturday. Over
the next month, they are expected to hammer at an agenda for peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Though the rebel leader had not promised to appear at the event,
Colombia had planned a great national party in expectation that the
president and Marulanda would shake hands. Television coverage was
live and continuous, and peasants dressed in their finest gathered
here from throughout the region. On Wednesday night, a priest at
the church climbed its belfry and practiced ringing all the bells
simultaneously for the event.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointment was palpable, though spokesmen on all sides
insisted the absence of Marulanda would not snuff out the peace
process. Merengue groups hired for the occasion sang and danced
away the rest of the day. But the church bells remained silent.

BROKER CHARGED WITH ALLEGED FRAUD

<P>
   BOSTON _ Federal authorities Thursday charged an investment
broker in connection with a scheme that allegedly bilked investors
nationwide out of at least $7 million and funded an opulent
lifestyle of luxury cars and fine jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   With stories ``invented out of whole cloth,'' Arthur F. Good,
51, allegedly persuaded investors to sink more than $21 million
into fake or highly speculative investments through his Boston
Investment Group, according to a 43-count information filed in US
District Court in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Good made some payments to investors in order to gain their
confidence, with the result that many of them gave him even greater
sums, the information alleges. Meanwhile, he allegedly took at
least $7 million for himself and several unnamed co-conspirators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ponzi schemes such as this one prey upon trusting investors
and steal from them their hard-earned money,'' said US Attorney
Donald K. Stern. ``This guy had an unusual thing going. In terms of
sheer dollars, it's very big.''
</P>
<P>
   Good, who was charged with conspiracy to commit mail and wire
fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering, did not return phone calls
to his home or his office in Quincy, a city adjacent to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Edward F. McLaughlin Jr., declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Other conspirators ``known and unknown'' also allegedly
participated in the scheme, according to the information, and
investigators said Good is expected to cooperate with authorities
in an ongoing probe of the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Promising returns as high as 200 percent in six months, Good and
his partners solicited investments for more than two years from
victims in ``all walks of life,'' including entrepreneurs,
retirees, dentists, and attorneys. They handed over sums from
$10,000 to nearly $1 million, the information alleges.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent effort to lend credence to claims that the
investments were legitimate, Good allegedly told potential
investors his deals were guaranteed by the Marriott Foundation, a
nonprofit organization run by heirs to the Marriott hotel fortune.
He also told investors he had important connections at Fidelity
Investments who would also help back the deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both stories were invented from whole cloth and contained no
truth,'' the information said. But Good ``repeated the stories to
many victims and then caused some of those victims to recruit
additional victims by retelling the same fraudulent tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, when a cautious investor demanded that Good prove his
relationship with Marriott, Good allegedly flew the investor to New
York for dinner with a man who claimed to be Bill Marriott, an heir
to the hotel fortune who runs the foundation. The man was actually
one of Good's co-conspirators, the information said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the information, Good spent lavishly to project the
image of a successful investment broker. He paid $78,000 for luxury
cars, renovated his company's offices in Quincy as well as his
Quincy home, and bought jewelry and electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Good ``took care to exhibit an outwardly affluent lifestyle, in
which both he and his wife drove expensive cars, wore fine jewelry
and otherwise demonstrated to the world that they were enjoying the
proceeds'' of his investment business, the information alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Good may have had some doubts about the
enterprise. According to the federal filing, he sent a fax message
to one or more of his co-conspirators in late 1996 that said, ``Try
to think through the things we've done with others' $ and how
stupid it is and sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities began investigating in early 1997 after three
worried investors who had given money to Good contacted the
Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth's securities division.
</P>
<P>
   State investigators interviewed Good, who was a ``very smooth
talker'' and ``almost had us fooled,'' according to one
investigator who asked not to be named. But the investigators
discovered that Good had lied about attending a funeral of one of
the investor's family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, why would he lie about such a simple thing?'' the
investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   After checking Good's financial statements, the state
investigators found large, unexplained sums coming into his
personal accounts and referred the case to federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Good remains free and is expected to make an initial appearance
in court ``within a couple weeks,'' federal authorities said.

COLOMBIAN TALKS OFF TO SHAKY START AS REBEL LEADER FAILS TO APPEAR 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN VICENTE DEL CAGUAN, Colombia _ It had been billed as a kind
of coming-out party for Manuel ``Sureshot'' Marulanda, the
reclusive Colombian guerrilla chieftain who hasn't shown his face
in public for decades.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's ceremony to inaugurate peace talks between the
Colombian government and the country's largest Marxist rebel group
took on a sour note when Marulanda failed to show up.
</P>
<P>
   President Andres Pastrana, who flew to this southern Colombian
town near the hamlet where actual talks will begin Saturday, sat
uncomfortably on an outdoor stage, glancing occasionally at the
white plastic chair beside him where Marulanda was supposed to sit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the guerrilla leader's absence, however, both sides
insisted that efforts to end Colombia's 35-year-old civil war were
on track and that negotiations will begin this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colombians, the hour of peace has arrived. Nothing can stop
it,`` Pastrana said in a 15-minute speech. ``The absence of Manuel
Marulanda must not be a reason for failing to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, hundreds of invited guests, journalists and
local residents gathered in the town square expecting a glimpse of
Marulanda, the 69-year-old leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, or FARC. A salsa band was on hand, and the town was
decorated with Colombian flags.
</P>
<P>
   There was still no sign of Marulanda as spectators listened to a
recording of the Colombian national anthem and the ceremony began.
Guests included former Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega as well
as Nobel Prize-winning author Gabriel Garcia Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana left immediately after his speech without shaking hands
with the three designated FARC negotiators, who kept their
automatic rifles with them on stage.
</P>
<P>
   There was some speculation that Marulanda was sick or
camera-shy. But FARC negotiator Raul Reyes said that Marulanda had
never confirmed he would attend the ceremony and had decided to
skip the event due to fears that he would be assassinated by
right-wing paramilitary groups. Pastrana and Marulanda held private
talks last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Marulanda's absence was ``not a snub'' of the Colombian
government, Reyes said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrilla leader's prepared speech _ a stinging critique of
government policies _ was read by FARC negotiator Joaquin Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   ``The different governments of the past three decades have run
the country with repressive measures. They have declared war
against the people.'' Gomez read from the six-page text. ``We want
peace without hunger, without repressive laws, with land, housing,
health care, welfare and jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Emma Mejia, a former foreign minister and one of four
government negotiators, pledged that the talks would go forward
with or without Marulanda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit that I would have liked for him to have been
there. But he will come,'' Mejia said. ``The day will arrive when
he will accompany us.''
</P>
<P>
   Others claimed, however, that Marulanda's disappearing act calls
into question the sincerity of the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence of Mr. Marulanda obviously frustrates many
people,'' said Alberto Casas, Pastrana's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Marulanda, who has spent nearly half a century in the jungle
fighting the Colombian government, founded the FARC in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the FARC is the largest rebel army in Latin America with
15,000 men and women in arms. It has dealt a series of military
defeats to the 120,000-member Colombian army and has made billions
of dollars through kidnappings and extortion and by taxing drug
traffickers. Most FARC fighters are better trained and paid than
the army's raw recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the rebels have made no concessions in the peace
process and are not even considering disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government has given in to several rebel demands,
including a 90-day withdrawal of police and army troops from a
16,000-square mile area of southern Colombia that includes San
Vicente del Caguan.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations will be the first between the two sides in
seven years. Government efforts are under way to initiate talks
with a smaller rebel group, the National Liberation Army, as well
as with paramilitary groups _ right-wing private armies that target
the rebels and their supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, who took office Aug. 7, has made peace his top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   His country's war is the longest-running civil conflict in Latin
America. In the past decade, 35,000 people have died. According to
government estimates, the fighting costs the nation about $8
billion annually and shaves 3 percentage points from the gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana referred to this tragic history in his speech, saying:
``Let's put as much effort and imagination into peace as we are now
putting into war. Let's not frustrate another generation of
Colombians.''
</P>
<P>
   If progress is made in the talks, the government may consider
maintaining the demilitarized zone, which is currently scheduled to
end Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   One of the immediate priorities of the FARC is to arrange for a
prisoner exchange. The guerrillas have captured 326 police and army
troops in military operations during the past two years and want to
exchange them for 450 jailed rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues include FARC participation in the eradication of
coca, which provides the raw material for cocaine, as well as
agrarian reform and a revamping of the army and the judicial
system.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration has placed the FARC on its
worldwide list of terrorist groups, a State Department official met
with Reyes, the FARC negotiator, in Costa Rica last month to
discuss the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this is the best chance in the last decade and
maybe for the next decade for an end to this cycle of violence,''
said U.S. Ambassador Curtis Kamman, who attended Thursday's
ceremony.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the last government witness nears the end of his
testimony, it is increasingly clear that the government's antitrust
case against Microsoft is an indictment not only of the business
practices of the world's dominant software maker but also of its
corporate character.
</P>
<P>
   Witness after witness _ an executive roll call of companies that
drive today's economy, including Intel, IBM, Netscape
Communications, America Online, Sun Microsystems and Apple Computer
_ has portrayed Microsoft Corp. as a bullying monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department charges that Microsoft is guilty of a
litany of misconduct, including illegally using its market muscle
to impose restrictive contracts, to engage in predatory pricing and
to attempt to divide markets.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft took each step, the government contends, to stifle
competition and thwart the challenge that Internet software posed
to its monopoly product, the Windows operating system, the
computing equivalent of the telephone dial tone.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the government's case seems sweeping and
persuasive. Yet as the trial has plodded since October through
lengthy cross-examination of each witness, with both sides
presenting mountains of e-mail and documents to support their
arguments and counterarguments, there is certainly room for doubt.
Each disputed meeting, contract and product strategy is open to
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   There is no jury in this trial; Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
must wade through all the conflicting evidence and decide whether
Microsoft's motives were mainly to impede competition or to improve
its products. In determining which side to believe, he will
inevitably be guided by his own judgment of whether Microsoft is a
vigorous competitor or predatory monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the Justice Department has gone to such lengths to
depict Microsoft as a corporate bad guy and its chairman, Bill
Gates, as evasive, uncooperative and less than truthful in the
videotaped excerpts of his deposition testimony shown repeatedly in
court.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft e-mail and strategy documents show, at the least,
a no-holds-barred approach to competition. In colorful language,
they outline plans to ``kill,'' ``pollute'' and ``subvert'' the
products of rivals. Marketing campaigns are referred to as jihads.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's worldview seems tinged with paranoia. Close partners
like Compaq Computer Corp. and Intel Corp. are at times painted as
enemy conspirators. Nor are all the threats, apparently, outside
the corporate campus in Redmond, Wash. In a 1997 e-mail to Gates, a
senior Microsoft executive, warned, ``In my opinion, Windows is in
the process of being exterminated here at Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Other government evidence seeks to show that Gates remained
dismissive of a long-running antitrust investigation, even after
Microsoft signed a consent decree with the Justice Department in
1994. At a 1995 meeting with Intel, he said, according to an Intel
executive: ``This antitrust thing will blow over. We haven't
changed our business practices at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft insists that its corporate culture is one of
``constructive paranoia,'' ensuring that it does not lose its
competitive edge. Besides, Microsoft's legal team argues,
inflammatory e-mail and unguarded comments have no standing in an
antitrust case, which should be based on facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The antitrust laws are not a code of civility in business,''
John Warden, Microsoft's lead trial lawyer, told the court in his
opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since, however, Microsoft has introduced its own
evidence _ including e-mail from rivals planning to gang up to
``kill the beast from Redmond'' _ to try to show that Microsoft's
swagger and style are not unusual among high-technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, antitrust experts say that the corporation's character
could prove important because the government is trying to show a
pattern of illegal behavior by Microsoft over years. If the
government wins, it could argue for far stronger sanctions against
Microsoft than were anticipated at the start of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could prove to be one of the strongest cards the Justice
Department has to play,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior
official in the Justice Department's antitrust division, now at the
Brookings Institution. ``Justice is arguing that Microsoft is a
recidivist, which has consistently shown a disregard for the
antitrust laws. They are trying to convince the judge that he
should deliver a strong guilty verdict and then do something big
and substantial so Microsoft won't do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft scoffs at such reasoning, asserting that the
government has simply not mounted much of a case. ``The Justice
Department has presented no critical mass of evidence against
Microsoft,'' said William Neukom, senior vice president of law and
corporate affairs. ``There is no monopoly. There is no predatory
pricing. There is no illegal tying of one product to another.
Microsoft's contracts have not foreclosed other companies from
distributing their products.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's case, most antitrust experts agree, is a mixed
bag of stronger and weaker claims _ all of which Microsoft will try
to refute when it begins its defense next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, these experts say, seems to have done
best in establishing that Microsoft has a monopoly in
personal-computer operating systems and has imposed restrictive
contracts on computer makers and Internet service suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monopoly argument pretty much makes itself, and it
certainly looks as if Microsoft has crossed the line in terms of
exclusionary contracts,'' said Carl Shapiro, an economist at the
University of California at Berkeley and a former senior official
at the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's first defense witness, Richard Schmalensee, an
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, will
testify that despite its domination of the operating-system market,
Microsoft does not possess monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee's rationale is that because of the rapid pace of
innovation in the computer industry, Microsoft's dominance could be
short-lived as it comes under attack from a variety of new
technologies like Sun Microsystems' Java, an Internet programming
language that could displace the pivotal role played by Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Many technology experts regard that argument as only half true.
``Microsoft is right when it says that its market position is under
constant threat,'' said David Yoffie, a professor at the Harvard
business school. But he added, ``It would take a long time, a
decade or so, to displace an entrenched technology standard like
Windows.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The government asserts that Microsoft's contracts with computer
makers and Internet access suppliers unfairly excluded its main
rival in the market for Internet browser software, Netscape
Communications Corp., from key channels of distribution.
</P>
<P>
   For example, America Online testified that it agreed to make
Microsoft's Internet Explorer the preferred browser for its
subscribers instead of Netscape's Navigator, after Microsoft agreed
to give America Online a featured place on the Windows desktop _ an
example, the Justice Department asserts, of Microsoft using its
operating-system monopoly to thwart competition.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that its contracts are garden-variety business
deals. Exclusive contracts with a handful of companies are not
illegal, its lawyers say, as long as competitors have open access
to many other channels of distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, Microsoft says, has distributed millions upon millions
of copies of its browser _ proof that Netscape has not been
hampered in any substantial way.
</P>
<P>
   The government's predatory pricing and product-tying charges,
antitrust experts say, are the weaker elements of the case. The
Justice Department contends that Microsoft's decision to give its
browser away, despite having spent hundreds of millions of dollars
developing it, is predatory.
</P>
<P>
   But the courts have generally rejected predatory pricing claims.
In a landmark 1993 ruling in Brooke Group Ltd. vs. Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco Corp., the Supreme Court declared that
``discouraging a price cut does not constitute sound antitrust
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, experts say, the government's charge that Microsoft
illegally tied its browser software to Windows to squelch
competition in the browser market will be difficult to prove.
Microsoft contends that its browser is an integrated feature of
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry experts have questioned Microsoft's motivation for
integrating its browser and operating system, but the courts have
been reluctant to meddle in product decisions. In a related case, a
federal appeals court ruled in June that Microsoft could bundle its
browser with Windows, noting the ``undesirability of having courts
oversee product design.''
</P>
<P>
   As Microsoft finished its cross-examination of the government's
final witness on Thursday, the two sides argued over the issues of
bundling and free distribution of Microsoft's browser.
</P>
<P>
   The questioning turned unusually testy as Michael Lacovara, a
Microsoft lawyer, asked Franklin Fisher, an MIT economist, about
the costs associated with giving away the Internet Explorer. Fisher
said that while it may be easier for computer makers and consumers,
``this case is not about being easy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Henry Ford had a monopoly, we'd all be driving black
cars,'' he said, his voice slowly rising. ``That's not what
competition is about. That's not what helping consumers is about.
If Microsoft forced upon the world one browser, that would be
really simple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you seem agitated,'' Lacovara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am agitated,'' Fisher shot back. ``I feel strongly on this
point. We're going to live in a Microsoft world. It may be a nice
world. But it's not a competitive world.''

PARENT CELLS FOUND IN BRAIN MAY BE KEY TO NERVE REPAIR

<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists in Sweden have identified for the first time the
parent cells that give rise to many and maybe all of the different
cell types in the adult brain. These neural stem cells, as they are
called, are of great interest because, if they could be manipulated
appropriately, they would be the obvious repair kit for replacing
damaged neural tissues in everything from spinal cord injuries to
Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish biologists worked with rats, but now that the cells'
hiding place in the rat brain is known, the human counterpart cells
are strongly expected to lie in the same place.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery of the cells, announced by Dr. Jonas Frisen and
colleagues at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm in an article
published in Friday's Cell, is part of a fundamental change in
brain biology. Until recently it had been thought that the brain
never renewed itself or added new cells after gaining its mature
form. The belief implied that the brain did not possess stem cells,
the source cells from which tissues like blood and skin can
constantly renew themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This dogma started to crack when biologists showed in 1992 that
a small percentage of cells in brain extracts could divide and
develop into the principal types of brain cell. Much work has since
been done on brain stem cells acquired by grinding up whole animal
brains. But no one knew where in the brain the stem cells come
from.
</P>
<P>
   In their paper, Frisen and his team say they have now identified
the brain's stem cells. The cells were already known as ependymal
cells, described by one biologist as the most boring cells in the
brain because their function is simply to line the cavities of the
ventricles and spinal cord which hold the spinal fluid.
</P>
<P>
   These cavity-lining cells are differentiated, meaning that they
have taken up a mature form. In contrast, all stem cells identified
so far are general, multipurpose cells, uncommitted to any specific
fate.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier experiments showed the cavity-lining cells did not
divide, confirming their uninteresting nature. But Frisen has found
the cells do divide, though at too slow a rate for the earlier
tests to detect. Their progeny cells divide rapidly and can
differentiate into both neurons and the support cells that are
found copiously throughout the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Frisen has found that neurons derived from the cavity-lining
cells can migrate from the cavity surface and replace cells in the
rat's olfactory bulb or smell-analysis unit, the one brain region
known to undergo a rapid turnover of nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   The Clark Kent/Superman existence of the cavity-lining cells has
surprised biologists. ``You'd never guess it in a million years,''
said Dr. Ben Barres, a developmental biologist at Stanford
University.
</P>
<P>
   But the identification makes sense, he said, because in the
developing embryo the brain cells grow out from stem cells that
line a hollow tube. As the organism matures, the tube becomes the
ventricles and spinal cord, and the stem cells disappear. It now
seems they stay in place but turn into cavity-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Frisen has found that the cavity-lining cells start dividing in
earnest when the spinal cord is injured. They then turn into the
support cells that make up much of the scar in spinal cord
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really cool because it wasn't clear where the glial
cells in scar tissue were coming from,'' Barres said, referring to
the support cells.
</P>
<P>
   Frisen said he hoped to find out how the cavity-lining cells
could be induced to make neurons instead of support cells at injury
sites. If so, a new approach to spinal cord injury might be
developed.
</P>
<P>
   The neural stem cells may also prove relevant to treating
Parkinson's disease, which is caused by the death of
dopamine-producing cells in a certain region of the brain.
Embryonic cells, such as those derived from fetuses, will develop
into these cells if placed in the dopamine region. But ethical
problems aside, there are not enough fetuses available to treat
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Frisen said the big advantage of the neural stem cells ``is that
maybe you could use the patient's own stem cells, avoiding both the
ethical and immunological problems.'' The cells would be obtained
through a biopsy of the cavity-lining cells of the spinal cord,
assuming these prove to be the human reservoir of neural stem
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Frisen identified the brain stem cells through his studies of
spinal cord injuries. He noticed that some of the cells at the
injury site were making a substance called nestin, which had been
shown by Dr. Ron McKay of the National Institutes of Health to be
produced by brain stem cells. The clue made him suspect the
cavity-liner cells were also the stem cells, a thesis it has taken
four years to establish.
</P>
<P>
   The neural stem cells are descendants of the primordial stem
cells that form in the earliest embryo.

GM AND UNION ARE NEAR DEAL ON NEW PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ohio, Canada)  (js) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors Corp. and the United Automobile Workers
union are close to an agreement on the construction of three new
assembly plants in the United States that would need only a third
as many workers as the operations they replace, company and union
officials said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hogan, GM's vice president for small cars, said that the
company, the world's largest auto maker, hoped to reach labor
agreements in 60 to 90 days that would allow the replacement of
GM's small-car factories in Lordstown, Ohio, and Lansing, Mich. The
new factories would likely be built within a few miles of the
existing sites and open in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   GM is planning a third new factory, also possibly in Michigan or
Ohio, to produce another vehicle that has not been publicly
identified, Hogan added, and is also likely to remodel a plant in
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Graham, the president of the UAW local union in Lordstown,
and Ralph Shepard, the president of a local union in Lansing, said
in interviews Thursday that so many of their workers were ready to
retire that the unions were willing to accept sharp cuts in plant
employment. In exchange, the new factories would provide long-term
job security for the workers who remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in anybody's mind that a new assembly
plant is going to take less people than we have today,'' Shepard
said. The current Lansing and Lordstown factories each have about
5,000 workers and would be replaced by plants employing fewer than
2,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Smith Jr., GM's chairman and chief executive, announced
plans in August for new plants, and the UAW was initially wary. But
GM has threatened to build the plants elsewhere, including Mexico,
if the union does not agree to the staffing cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The new factories will need far less labor than current
operations because they will rely heavily on outside suppliers,
which are seldom unionized and thus have lower labor costs. These
suppliers will deliver large chunks of vehicles to the plants
instead of hundreds of pieces to be bolted together on the assembly
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Lordstown factory, for example, now assembles more than 100
pieces to make the dashboard, glove compartment and steering
apparatus of the Chevrolet Cavalier, Hogan said; the next small car
will have the front of its passenger compartment delivered as a
single unit.
</P>
<P>
   GM's plans for the new factories had seemed until recently like
a possible trigger for another strike when its national agreement
with the union expires in September. A 54-day strike last summer
cost GM $2.5 billion in after-tax profits.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    To me, Martin Luther King Day is much more than a holiday. So, I
often wonder what those who didn't know him think and feel about
this man, and this special day.
 &HT;    Sure, everyone knows of his assassination, his civil rights
activism, and the publishing of his papers, his speeches and
writings on CD-Rom. With his posthumous autobiography _ a
collection of his letters and speeches stitched together by
Stanford historian Clayborne Carson _ people may now become more
familiar with his teachings.
 &HT;    I grew up in Huntsville, Alabama. My parents strategized and
marched with Dr. King. I learned, when I was 4 years old, about
protests and civil disobedience from my parents when they returned
from sit-ins at segregated lunch counters. I thought my mother was
not very bright when she drove by numerous schools and failed to
enroll my older brother.
 &HT;    At the same time I learned why we would not be buying new
clothes from the segregated stores at Easter: because Dr. King, in
conjunction with the local churches, had organized a boycott. If we
couldn't shop there at any time by entering the front door, then we
wouldn't patronize them.
 &HT;    Easter clothes and accoutrements were a very big deal among the
Christian African Americans of the South. It was the time when we
put on the dog. Our finest clothes. We all got entirely new
outfits, the whole regalia including underwear, shoes, purses, hats
and gloves. We were newly attired from head to toe.
 &HT;    So, it was also a very big deal to sacrifice this. In fact the
strategy was to wear blue jeans that Easter Sunday in 1962. Now
little black girls did not wear pants to church anywhere in the
1960s much less jeans. But it represented a visible financial
boycott of the stores which discriminated against us because of
race. Dr. King knew that this would be a hard sell to the black
community, but that it would deliver an essential and direct hit to
our oppressors.
 &HT;    I never met Dr. King, but my father's vivid descriptions of the
meetings to organize the boycott, and the act of wearing jeans that
Easter, had me believing in my young mind that I had actually met
the great man. His picture hung in our home as it did in almost
every black home in the 1960s _ alongside Jesus Christ and John F.
Kennedy.
 &HT;    My father, just three years younger than Dr. King, spoke of him
as the scholarly man and genius that he was _ and as though he were
his good friend. King was respected both as a minister and as an
educated man. His oratory skills were legendary. If there was an
opportunity to hear Dr. King preach, you grabbed it. Intellect
combined with eloquence, principals of non-violence and civil
disobedience and his determination to end discrimination, coupled
with down home preachin' so good that it made you want to holler _
these made for a stunning combination.
 &HT;    I wonder if Dr. King, who would have been 70 this year, might
have been the elder statesman on the President's Commission on
Race. What would the man make of this place in 1999, over 30 years
after his death and 13 years after his birthday was declared a
national holiday? What would he think about all the streets named
after him? Nice gestures indeed, but King was a man of substance.
Stamps, holidays and streets were not in his master plan in life or
death.
 &HT;    King advocated for diversity, for an end to discrimination. His
``dream'' has not come to fruition. But neither are we in the
nightmare that some might suggest. ``Diversity'' is a word that is
either universally embraced or loathed.
 &HT;    Surveys show that most people simply ``talk the talk'' rather
than ``walking the walk'' around the diversity Dr. King dreamed of.
Even with the talk, most of us spend the majority of our time with
people who look like us rather than with those who may reflect the
diversity of which we speak.
 &HT;    So, I will honor the anniversary of Dr. King's birth as I have
even in the years before it became a federal holiday. I will shed
tears over the loss of a great man, a philosopher, and the lack of
knowledge that most have of his life and legacy.
 &HT;    And I will offer a not so silent prayer that the best way to
honor Dr. King is by listening to or reading some of his great
speeches and by ``walking the walk'' of diversity.
 &HT;    Actions do speak louder than words.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    CHASE CITY, Va. _ A deadly winter storm threw me into the arms
of a married woman _ a wealthy, Southern-born white woman at that.
 &HT;    On Christmas Eve, I fell for Emma Garnet Tate Lowell, a resident
of Raleigh, N.C. I had met her a few days earlier, as it were, in a
bookstore in Cary, a fast-growing town near Raleigh, and brought
her home with me.
 &HT;    As the mercury fell into the lower 20s and as waves of sleet and
frozen rain drummed on the shingle roof of my two-room vacation
cabin hidden on a hill among apple, pear and pecan trees, I curled
up in bed with Emma Garnet.
 &HT;    Outside, power lines sagged under the weight of glistening ice.
In my yard and in the distance, tree limbs broke and plunged to the
ground, bringing down wires _ cable, telephone and electricity _
with them. Transformers exploded, and the town's emergency siren
wailed. Within minutes, every business had closed. The traffic
light at the major intersection quit working, and chaos reigned for
about an hour there before the police barricaded three square
blocks.
 &HT;    Light from the scented candles _ which I had purchased minutes
after the electricity shutdown _ flickered against the wood-paneled
walls.
 &HT;    Suddenly, reality sank in: I had no electricity, no television,
no radio, no refrigerator. I was on my own.
 &HT;    The ambiance was perfect for an affair. I held Emma Garnet
against my chest, anxious to explore a new horizon. I felt the
warmth of the heater and heard its metal casing pinging as flames
rose and fell. Then I smelled the reliable aroma of burning oak,
reminding me of times past, when life was simpler, when the price
of love was commitment and support ...
 &HT;    After a time, my eyes got used to the semi-darkness, and I could
sense Emma Garnet's full presence. I could hear her inner voice,
the one that trusted me with knowledge of Dr. Quincy Lowell, her
husband, the selfless physician whom she loved more than life
itself.
 &HT;    Emma Garnet shared her deepest secrets with me. Her father,
Samuel P. Tate, for example, was a racist, a slave owner, a crook,
a braggart, a rotten husband, a child abuser, a murderer. Her
mother, a gentle soul, died of broken dreams, abuse and neglect.
Her siblings died of the same causes. Samuel P. Tate died as he
should have _ in pain and bitter disappointment. He died like his
beloved Old Confederacy had died. Even his vast riches could not
save the South once the Civil War was under way, after the blood of
Rebel soldiers ``ran in bucketfuls,'' as Emma Garnet described it.
 &HT;    As a nurse working alongside her husband in the Confederate
hospital in Raleigh, Emma Garnet, also the mother of three girls,
possessed the terrible wisdom of mothers. As the war marched
inevitably against the South, she said, ``Mothers smell blood
before the wound is given. We see the rent place on the child's arm
before the arrow strikes.''
 &HT;    Emma Garnet's humanity is the value center of her world. She
respects the black slaves and adores Clarice, her lifelong
domestic. After Clarice died, Emma Garnet said of her friend:
 &HT;    ``She was the strongest woman I had ever known, ever would know.
... She worked for and loved all of us, been our constant guardian.
We knew what she believed to be moral, and while at the top of her
list was eliminating slavery, she did not interfere in its
flourishing.
 &HT;    ``Her mission was not to change history but to help both white
and black prevail over the circumstances of living in that place,
the South, in our time. She worked with the consequences dealt her
by others, in the travails of her race. She was not merely
dignified, and to label her such would be not an error in judgment
but one of degree. No, she was dignity itself.''
 &HT;    Of course, Emma Garnet is a fictional character, the protagonist
of Kaye Gibbons' newest novel, ``On the Occasion of My Last
Afternoon.'' I had never read a Gibbons novel, and I was glad to
have discovered her and Emma Garnet during one of the worst winter
storms to strike Southside Virginia in many years.
 &HT;    I had not read a book by candlelight since I was a child in
Florida. The dim light was protective and soothing as I flipped the
pages of ``On the Occasion.'' I especially loved the hours between
midnight and dawn, when I felt most alone, when solitude is
salvation.
 &HT;    Reading Gibbons in my cozy cabin, I was reminded of another
writer, May Sarton, with whom I fell in love many years ago under
similar circumstances, who helped me appreciate myself for myself.
 &HT;    ``The value of solitude _ one of its values _ is, of course,
that there is nothing to cushion against attacks from within. ...
Life requires patient understanding, imagination, the power to
endure constant adversity _ the weather, for example! To go with,
not against the elements, an inexhaustible vitality summoned back
each day ... ''
 &HT;    While my neighbors and friends spent five days cursing the
darkness, the cold and the inconveniences that they brought, I
hibernated with Emma Garnet, loving her gentle touch, her sure
wisdom and, yes, her easy acceptance of her imminent death. ``On
the occasion of my last afternoon, I feel no sorrow, feel no
regret,'' she writes. ``This has been such a glorious afternoon _
my heart would not weep if I did not live to see another.''
 &HT;    Emma Garnet is dead. I, too, have no regets. I am a better
person for having met her.

 &HT;    Emma Garnet's humanity is the value center of her world. She
respects the black slaves and adores Clarice, her lifelong
domestic. After Clarice died, Emma Garnet said of her friend:
 &HT;    ``She was the strongest woman I had ever known, ever would know.
... She worked for and loved all of us, been our constant guardian.
We knew what she believed to be moral, and while at the top of her
list was eliminating slavery, she did not interfere in its
flourishing.
 &HT;    ``Her mission was not to change history but to help both white
and black prevail over the circumstances of living in that place,
the South, in our time. She worked with the consequences dealt her
by others, in the travails of her race. She was not merely
dignified, and to label her such would be not an error in judgment
but one of degree. No, she was dignity itself.''
 &HT;    Of course, Emma Garnet is a fictional character, the protagonist
of Kaye Gibbons' newest novel, ``On the Occasion of My Last
Afternoon.'' I had never read a Gibbons novel, and I was glad to
have discovered her and Emma Garnet during one of the worst winter
storms to strike Southside Virginia in many years.
 &HT;    I had not read a book by candlelight since I was a child in
Florida. The dim light was protective and soothing as I flipped the
pages of ``On the Occasion.'' I especially loved the hours between
midnight and dawn, when I felt most alone, when solitude is
salvation.
 &HT;    Reading Gibbons in my cozy cabin, I was reminded of another
writer, May Sarton, with whom I fell in love many years ago under
similar circumstances, who helped me appreciate myself for myself.
 &HT;    ``The value of solitude _ one of its values _ is, of course,
that there is nothing to cushion against attacks from within. ...
Life requires patient understanding, imagination, the power to
endure constant adversity _ the weather, for example! To go with,
not against the elements, an inexhaustible vitality summoned back
each day ... ''
 &HT;    While my neighbors and friends spent five days cursing the
darkness, the cold and the inconveniences that they brought, I
hibernated with Emma Garnet, loving her gentle touch, her sure
wisdom and, yes, her easy acceptance of her imminent death. ``On
the occasion of my last afternoon, I feel no sorrow, feel no
regret,'' she writes. ``This has been such a glorious afternoon _
my heart would not weep if I did not live to see another.''
 &HT;    Emma Garnet is dead. I, too, have no regets. I am a better
person for having met her.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    As Democrat Grey Davis becomes the first Democratic governor of
California in 16 years and only the fourth in this century, he is
joined by the independently elected Lieut. Gov. Cruz Bustamante,
Democrat and former speaker of the Assembly. He is the first
Hispanic to win statewide office since the 1870s. He will not be
the last.
 &HT;    Hispanics now are 13 percent of the California electorate.
Hispanics are the fastest growing segment of the nation. Thus, for
a political party to win elections in California or other important
parts of the country, it must attract Hispanics as they reach out
for a better life.
 &HT;    This past November election demonstrated mighty examples of this
reach. In California, newly enfranchised Hispanics, new citizens,
registered by a ratio of 4-to-1 Democratic and delivered almost 77
percent of their vote to the party of Grey Davis and Cruz
Bustamante, the Democrats. According to exit polls, Republican
gubernatorial candidate Dan Lungren received but 23 percent of the
Hispanic vote. He had expected 35 percent, which, with a 10 percent
higher Republican turnout would have elected him. As it is, because
Hispanics voted a Democratic ticket, California is now almost tied
with Hawaii as the most Democratic state in the country.
 &HT;    California Hispanics punished the Republicans for an
anti-Hispanic, anti-immigrant and anti-illegal Mexican immigrant
campaign fueled by Gov. Pete Wilson (former mayor of San Diego). He
had funded and promoted the floundering Save Our State (SOS)
initiative sponsored by some of the worst racists in California.
 &HT;    The Wilson-SOS campaign would have imbedded into state law
massive violations of the civil and constitutional rights of almost
30 percent of California's population _ that of Mexican-origin.
Wilson sponsored TV ads in favor of SOS, forever linking the
governor with racism _ as far as Hispanics, the ultimate target of
SOS, were concerned. They carried those anti-Wilson feelings into
the 1998 voting booth.
 &HT;    But, California was the only place such political punishment
against Republicans by Hispanics manifested itself.
 &HT;    Nationwide, Hispanic political support for a Republican Congress
increased by 44 percent, rising from 1996's 25 percent to 1998's 36
percent. In Florida, Cubans voted en masse for Republican Jeb Bush
for governor and helped him gain Republican majorities in both
houses of the state legislature. In Texas, Mexican American voters
flocked to the polls to give Republican George Bush 49 percent of
their vote and gave him majorities in such historically Democratic
counties as El Paso, a county that had never voted Republican. In
Arizona, they similarly voted in higher percentages for
Republicans, including U.S. Sen. John McCain, a candidate for
president.
 &HT;    So, 1998 provided us with two examples of Hispanic voter
flexibility and power. Heavy Democratic voting by Hispanics in
California delivered the state into Democratic hands for the first
time in almost a generation; and heavy Hispanic voting for
Republicans in Texas and Florida stoutly tipped the balance for the
Brothers Bush.
 &HT;    Looking at the electoral mathematics of the situation, either
party that carries two of these three states _ California, Texas
and Florida _ will win the presidency. President Clinton won in
1992 and 1996 by carrying California and Florida, but would have
lost each time had he lost California.
 &HT;    The Republican formula for denying the Democrats the White House
in 2000 is not very complicated. They must carry Texas and Florida
and make a strenuous effort in California. Thus, they must take
their success of 1998 among the Hispanics of Texas and Florida and
use the same methods, and, perhaps, the same candidates in
California.
 &HT;    They must also use the same methods, policies and philosophies
among the numerous Hispanic voters of Illinois, New Jersey and New
York, to keep these states always in political doubt.
 &HT;    Between now and November, 2000, both Democrats and Republicans
must look to California to frame their 2000 goals, for California
is the great prize.
 &HT;    My prediction: the presidential race of 2000 will turn on how
Hispanics vote in Florida, Texas and California; That both parties
will set records in spending to attract Hispanic voters. That
though California Hispanics might not forgive Pete Wilson, a
Republican, they will vote in higher numbers for a good Republican
candidate for president. Hispanics in Texas and Florida have
manifested a tendency to vote Republican in big numbers _ will
California Hispanics follow their lead?
 &HT;    Hispanics will be the key to the White House next year, just as
they were this time for the statehouse in California.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    SPOKANE, Wash. _ The hodgepodge of gambling laws impacting the
Indian nations of America took a dramatic downturn for the
Colville, Spokane and Shoalwater Bay Indian nations of Washington
state last month.
 &HT;    A ruling by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals effectively kills
slot-machine operations on those reservations.
 &HT;    The slot machines on the Shoalwater Bay reservation were removed
in September and the leadership of the Spokane and Colville nations
then realized it would be just a matter of time before a similar
attack came down on their casinos.
 &HT;    U.S. District Judge Fred Van Sickle ruled that slot machines are
illegal in Washington under the Johnson Act, an anti-organized
crime law that bans slot machines on Indian reservations, enacted
in the 1950s.
 &HT;    Are the judges comparing the Indian nations of Washington to
organized criminals? What does organized crime have to do with the
Indian nations? This is one of the most shallow rulings in Indian
history.
 &HT;    Of course, the real culprit in all of the bad, unrealistic and
questionable rulings by the federal judges and state legislative
bodies impacting Indians is the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. This
law was passed in 1987 with no teeth, no direction and worse, no
input from the Indian leadership.
 &HT;    Long before his recent, untimely death, Wendell Chino, chairman
of the Mescalero Apache Tribe, railed against the act. He correctly
predicted it would create a labyrinth of rulings from one state to
the next with dire consequences for Indian tribes attempting to
exercise sovereign rights to build any business upon their own
lands.
 &HT;    Chino and Roger Jourdain, the longtime chairman of the Red Lake
Band of Chippewa in Minnesota, brought a suit against the federal
government to stop the Indian gaming act from becoming the law of
the land. They didn't want to stop Indian gaming, they just wanted
to remove the handcuffs from the Indian nations.
 &HT;    Both of these farsighted leaders predicted that greed would
eventually undermine efforts at uniting the Indian nations in a
common fight against the act. Up stepped a tribe that had just
gained federal recognition, the Mashentuckett Pequot of
Connecticut. It made deals with the state of Connecticut that have
been used as a yardstick by other state governments in curtailing,
taxing, and undermining efforts of other Indian nations to secure
gaming compacts. Jourdain and Chino predicted that state
governments would use the gaming act to challenge the sovereignty
of Indian nations.
 &HT;    The Pequots couldn't have cared less about the terrible
precedents they were setting for other Indian nations of America.
They never saw beyond the glitter of dollar signs. Without
consulting the real Indian nations, they agreed to pay taxes on
their gaming revenues to the state of Connecticut. Indian nations
never paid taxes to state governments before this greedy, little,
upstart tribe set that precedent.
 &HT;    The Pequots, and their flashy Foxwood Casino at Ledyard, Conn.,
have since done much to damage the credibility and the legal
efforts of other Indian nations. Their cocktail waitresses with
skimpy, simulated buckskin dresses and cardboard feathers sticking
out of their heads added insult to injury to those Indian nations
which consider these things sacred.
 &HT;    The Confederated Colville Tribes, the Spokane, the Shoalwater
Bay and 19 other Indian nations in the state of Washington, are
paying the price for the greed of one tiny, eastern tribe which
spent the last eight years trying to find itself and buy the
respect of other Indian nations.
 &HT;    If Colville and Spokane lose their slot machines, more than 600
people will lose their jobs. Not only that, the tribes may have to
shut down their casinos just when the profits enabled them to build
better homes, provide employment, health care, scholarships for
their children, improve their schools and to rebuild the
infrastructure of their nations.
 &HT;    Is this what the National Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was
supposed to do?
 &HT;    The Confederated Colville and the Spokane are a proud and
traditional people. Do you believe for one minute they will stand
by silently and allow an outside intruder to destroy their future?
 &HT;    There are 23 states that allow slot machines in Indian casinos.
Why these states should have any say at all into what Indian
nations can or cannot do on their own lands can be laid at the
doorstep of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act _ and to the greed of
a few Indian nations who did not heed the dire warnings of Roger
Jourdain, Wendell Chino, Elmer Savilla and myself.
 &HT;    We spoke out loudly against the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in
1986, not to prevent Indian nations from establishing casinos on
their lands, but to advise them to proceed with caution and, above
all, not to sell out their sovereignty for a few pieces of silver.
 &HT;    Tribal leaders beware. The handwriting is on the wall.

traditional people. Do you believe for one minute they will stand
by silently and allow an outside intruder to destroy their future?
 &HT;    There are 23 states that allow slot machines in Indian casinos.
Why these states should have any say at all into what Indian
nations can or cannot do on their own lands can be laid at the
doorstep of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act _ and to the greed of
a few Indian nations who did not heed the dire warnings of Roger
Jourdain, Wendell Chino, Elmer Savilla and myself.
 &HT;    We spoke out loudly against the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in
1986, not to prevent Indian nations from establishing casinos on
their lands, but to advise them to proceed with caution and, above
all, not to sell out their sovereignty for a few pieces of silver.
 &HT;    Tribal leaders beware. The handwriting is on the wall.

<P>
   In California, a mother who fled Cambodia's Khmer Rouge with two
young children now struggles to feed her family after losing food
stamps benefits.
</P>
<P>
   On the opposite coast one year ago, an elderly Chinese legal
immigrant in Brooklyn took an overdose of pills and tied a plastic
bag around his head upon learning that he would lose his benefits.
His suicide note revealed that he had cancer and did not want to
impose the burden of medical support on his family.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the child in Washington state who suffered
through six ear infections without health care over the course of a
year. Although the child is a citizen, his parents were afraid that
applying for health care on the child's behalf would jeopardize the
mother's green card application.
</P>
<P>
   These are the stories that proponents of the 1996 welfare reform
initiative overlook when they point to its accomplishments.
Instead, they focus on declining numbers of welfare recipients as a
sign that the welfare-to-work initiative is actually working.
</P>
<P>
   While it is still too early to know whether reform initiatives
will permanently succeed in moving people off welfare and into the
work force, it is certain that for immigrants welfare reform has
meant anything but success. Since the enactment of reform policies
two years ago, a chilling picture has emerged, painting our
immigrant communities as one in an environment of fear.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in welfare rolls can be credited in part to two
basic factors _ both of which have been extremely detrimental to
the Asian immigrant community.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that nearly half of the savings from welfare reform
came from cuts in benefits to legal immigrants. While the intent
behind welfare reform as a whole was to compel able-bodied people
to work, the law also indiscriminately stripped the rights of
elderly and disabled immigrants _ those legal immigrants who are
least able to work _ to access basic government assistance. Such
cuts invariably led to mounting reports of suicides among the
elderly. The denial of basic rights, however, didn't stop at the
elderly and disabled. With a stroke of a pen, immigrant children
lost access to basic nutrition and health programs such as food
stamps and Medicaid. Congress has since realized that it went too
far and recently restored limited benefits to narrow categories of
legal immigrants. But hundreds of thousands of aging individuals,
families with children, and people with disabilities remain without
a basic safety net.
</P>
<P>
   The second factor that has added to a decline in welfare numbers
is the widespread fear that prevents immigrants from applying for
benefits even when they are eligible. Government workers have
routinely used intimidation tactics to discourage eligible
immigrants from seeking benefits. As a result of these
inappropriate government practices, it is a commonly held notion
among immigrant commmunities that accepting benefits could result
in severe consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of a U.S.-born child in Massachusetts, who was
rushed to the hospital by ambulance when he went into convulsions,
but was denied ongoing medical treatment because his mother
believed that she would not receive her green card if her son was
on Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the farm worker in Sonoma County, California,
who cut his hand badly on the job, yet chose to stitch up his own
wound rather than seek emergency room care for fear that doing so
would jeopardize his immigrant visa application.
</P>
<P>
   These fears of the government are not unfounded. Immigrant
rights advocates cite numerous cases of eligible immigrants facing
life-threatening situations who had been intimidated from applying
for benefits by government workers.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego County, for example, a mother was too afraid to
apply for food assistance on behalf of her U.S.-born child, because
the local welfare agency threatened to report her to the INS
(Immigration and Naturalization Service) and have her deported. In
other instances, INS officers have told applicants for immigrant
visas or naturalization, or individuals wishing to sponsor a family
member to the United States, that receipt of benefits by them or
their family members will result in outright denial of their
application.
</P>
<P>
   The more extreme cases of abuse have involved INS officials at
airports demanding that legal immigrants, as a condition of
re-entering the U.S. from a trip abroad, reimburse the government
for any benefits they have legally received in the past. In one
reported case, a man was required to repay the government $10,000.
Although both the INS and the state department have since clarified
that such practices are illegal, many immigrants still fear that
such action may continue.
</P>
<P>
   Word of INS actions has spread throughout the immigrant
community, resulting in the pervasive unwillingness of immigrants
to seek aid when they most need it.
</P>
<P>
   This ``chilling effect'' has been documented in a recent survey
asking Los Angeles County welfare workers to list barriers to
people applying for health care benefits. Fears about the INS were
listed eight times more often than any other single barrier. In
fact, there are over 200,000 uninsured immigrant children overall
in Los Angeles County who are eligible for the Child Health
Insurance Program, but as of September 1998, only 4,000 had
enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Urban Institute, Los Angeles County experienced
a 48 percent drop in Medicaid enrollment of citizen children from
immigrant families over the two-year period since welfare reform,
with no similar drop in applications by children from citizen
families.
</P>
<P>
   As we continue to assess the success or failure of welfare
reform, we must not ignore the devastating impact it has had on
immigrants and their families. For them, declining welfare rolls
are clearly not a measure of success. Rather, they are a stark
reminder that the most vulnerable in our communities _ children and
the elderly _ have either lost their right to government benefits,
or are simply too afraid to access them.
</P>
<P>
   And as our communities continue to struggle with the legacy of
welfare reform, we must seek out policy remedies that are not just
about reinstating benefits for all legal immigrants, but also
ensuring that eligible immigrants are guaranteed access to the
critical services they need and are entitled to.

   WHAT MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY MEANS TO ME. To columnist Akilah
Monifa, Martin Luther King Day is much more than a holiday. It is
the `good friend' her father spoke of, the sit-ins her parents took
part in, the schools her brother could not got to, and the
sacrifice of a new outfit for Easter, she recalls. Monifa grew up
in Alabama, and her parents met and marched with Dr. King. She
learned about civil disobedience right at the source. ``King
advocated for diversity, for an end to discrimination,'' she notes
``but, sadly, most people today simply `talk the talk' rather than
`walking the walk' around the diversity Dr. King dreamed of.''

Garnet is a fictional character, the protagonist of Kaye Gibbons'

   HISPANIC VOTING POWER: THE KEY TO THE WHITE HOUSE. Last
November's elections provided two examples of Hispanic voter
flexibility and power, writes columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras.
Heavy Democratic voting by Hispanics in California delivered the
state into Democratic hands for the first time in almost a
generation; and heavy Hispanic voting for Republicans in Texas and
Florida stoutly tipped the balance for the Brothers Bush. ``Either
party that carries two of these three states _ California, Texas
and Florida _ will win the presidency in 2000,'' he says, adding
``And the Hispanic vote will be the key.''

   WHAT MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY MEANS TO ME. To columnist Akilah
Monifa, Martin Luther King Day is much more than a holiday. It is
the `good friend' her father spoke of, the sit-ins her parents took
part in, the schools her brother could not got to, and the
sacrifice of a new outfit for Easter, she recalls. Monifa grew up
in Alabama, and her parents met and marched with Dr. King. She
learned about civil disobedience right at the source. ``King
advocated for diversity, for an end to discrimination,'' she notes
``but, sadly, most people today simply `talk the talk' rather than
`walking the walk' around the diversity Dr. King dreamed of.''

   BASKING IN THE WARMTH OF EMMA GARNET. On Christmas Eve, a deadly
winter storm threw him into the arms of Emma Garnet Tate Lowell, a
wealthy, white woman residing in Raleigh, N.C., confesses columnist
Bill Maxwell. ``I had met her a few days earlier, as it were, in a
local bookstore and brought her home with me.'' Of course, Emma
Garnet is a fictional character, the protagonist of Kaye Gibbons'
newest novel, ``On the Occasion of My Last Afternoon.'' ``I had
never read a Gibbons novel,'' he adds, ``but I was glad to have
discovered her and Emma Garnet during one of the worst winter
storms to strike Southside Virginia in many years.''

   HISPANIC VOTING POWER: THE KEY TO THE WHITE HOUSE. Last
November's elections provided two examples of Hispanic voter
flexibility and power, writes columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras.
Heavy Democratic voting by Hispanics in California delivered the
state into Democratic hands for the first time in almost a
generation; and heavy Hispanic voting for Republicans in Texas and
Florida stoutly tipped the balance for the Brothers Bush. ``Either
party that carries two of these three states _ California, Texas
and Florida _ will win the presidency in 2000,'' he says, adding
``And the Hispanic vote will be the key.''

   GREED CREATES BAD PRECEDENT. The hodgepodge of gambling laws
impacting the Indian nations of America took a dramatic downturn
for the Colville, Spokane and Shoalwater Bay Indian nations of
Washington state last month, reports columnist Tim Giago. A U.S.
district judge ruled that slot machines are illegal in Washington
under the Johnson Act, an anti-organized crime law that bans slot
machines on Indian reservations, enacted in the 1950s. ``Are the
judges comparing the Indian nations of Washington to organized
criminals?'' Giago asks. ``This is one of the most shallow rulings
in Indian history.''

   WELFARE REFORM: ANYTHING BUT A SUCCESS. Proponents of the 1996
welfare reform bill focus on declining numbers of welfare
recipients as a sign that the welfare-to-work initiative is
actually working. But ``nearly half of the savings from welfare
reform came from cuts in benefits to legal immigrants,'' writes
attorney Jayne Park in A. MAGAZINE: INSIDE ASIAN AMERICA. And the
law ``indiscriminately stripped the rights of elderly and disabled
immigrants _ those legal immigrants who are least able to work _ to
access basic government assistance, and of immigrant children who
lost access to basic nutrition and health programs such as food
stamps and Medicaid.''

   STOCK MARKET RECOVERS FROM AN EARLY DEEP PLUNGE
</P>
<P>
   Stocks retreated from record levels but then rallied in the
afternoon and finished little changed in a session marked by some
warnings of profit shortfalls and a mildly negative reappraisal by
Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman, Sachs, one of Wall Street's most
prominent strategists.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average lost 7.21 points, to 9,537,76,
after being down as much as 118.95 points. The Nasdaq market rose
5.23 points, to 2,326.09, its fifth record in a row. The S&AMP;P 500
fell 2.61 points, to 1,269.73. Ms. Cohen revised her recommended
portfolio mix, to 70 percent in stocks from 72 percent and to 12
percent in higher-yielding corporate bonds from 10 percent.

   BRITAIN CUTS INTEREST RATE TO 6 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth time since October, the Bank of England cut a key

COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE WON'T TAKE ON UMPIRES
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richie Phillips, the head of the umpires union, met with two
major-league baseball officials Thursday and afterward declared
dead a plan to take jurisdiction of the umpires away from the
league offices and place them under the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is a dead issue forever,'' Phillips said by telephone
from Philadelphia, ``but it's certainly a dead issue right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The question that remained, however, was when was the change of
jurisdiction a live issue? Sandy Alderson, the commissioner's vice
president for baseball operations, said the plan was never alive
for the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Others in baseball said the plan was alive for 1999 until the
middle of December, when it was aborted because no one had talked
to the umpires about it and because officials learned how costly a
switch could be _ $400,000 to $600,000 in termination pay for each
umpire for a potential total ranging from $25 million to $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson said no one had to talk to the umpires about it because
there was never any thought of implementing the switch for the
coming season. Because of increasing concern about the quality of
umpiring, the commissioner's office has studied the idea of
assuming responsibility for the umpires, taking them out of the
National and American League offices and merging them into a single
unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is there will be some move in that direction or at
least some move considered at the owners meeting next week,''
Alderson said after meeting with Phillips at his Philadelphia
office. ``However, there was never any decision made about how the
details of that might be effectuated.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems fairly clear that by the 2000 season the umpires will
be working as a single unit out of the commissioner's office.
Nothing is clear about the behind-the-scenes maneuvering that has
raged in the background at the baseball offices on Park Avenue in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to monitor Park Avenue politics and continue to
remain as far removed from it as possible,'' Phillips wrote in
December in a letter to the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   The shift of the umpires to the aegis of the commissioner's
office would be a major step in the emasculation of the league
presidents and their offices. Some people in baseball have long
felt there was a need to centralize operations in the
commissioner's office, and the umpires would be the first step, the
beginning of the end of the league offices.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   American League president Gene Budig declined to comment
Thursday on the developments. National League president Leonard
Coleman was not available, his secretary said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plan was designed more than a month ago, Major
League Baseball officials _ Alderson and Rob Manfred, vice
president for labor relations _ met for the first time Thursday
with Phillips. No one from Major League Baseball spoke with
Phillips until mid-December, after word circulated that the umpires
were being removed from league jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had not been any discussion of this subject with the
union,'' Alderson said, ``because there was never an intention to
disturb the collective bargaining agreement. From that standpoint,
there would have been no change the union needed to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's office would have to secure the umpires'
agreement on the switch because it would represent a change in
their terms and conditions of employment.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips declined to say if he thought officials were trying to
change the umpires' status without their input, but in a letter to
the league presidents in December he referred to ``arrogance'' and
``lack of respect'' with which the umpires are treated. If
officials had proceeded with the plan, the umpires would have most
likely been entitled to severance pay. The umpires' employer would
change from the league offices to the commissioner's office, and
that change would constitute termination of their services.
</P>
<P>
   Under the collective bargaining agreement, the umpires receive
severance pay based on a seniority schedule, with $400,000 being
the maximum. Most of the umpires have enough service to be close to
that amount. Furthermore, if the plan had gone into effect for the
1999 season, some labor lawyers say the umpires would have been
entitled to their salaries for the year on top of the severance.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring an average salary of about $200,000, the average total
per umpire could have reached $600,000, for all of the umpires
about $40 million. Even though the labor agreement ends after the
1999 season, the umpires still might be entitled to the $400,000
severance if the plan were put into effect a year from now. Terms
and conditions of an expired contract remain in effect until a new
agreement is reached or the employer unilaterally implements new
terms and conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Those payments would be subjects for bargaining during
negotiations, but the umpires' union would most likely seek other
concessions, including a no-termination clause for some period,
perhaps five years, and the right of current umpires to choose
their schedule, whether it be all games in their present league or
a split schedule in both leagues.

HOLIDAY SALES REFLECT ACCEPTANCE OF DVD, INDUSTRY SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The doubting over DVD has vanished, obliterated
by a holiday season that saw the new format become the latest
must-have consumer electronics gizmo.
</P>
<P>
   After less than two years on the market, DVDs have achieved
mainstream status, analysts say. More than a million American homes
now have DVD players and $250 million in discs have been sold;
those figures should hit 19.4 million and $3 billion by 2003, media
analyst Thomas Adams predicted this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see an extremely promising outlook for 1999,'' he added.
``Its sales are already way in advance of the initial numbers for
CDs and VCRs.''
</P>
<P>
   Digital versatile discs debuted in March 1997 with few titles
and bare-bones players selling for $700 and $800. The discs are the
same size as audio compact discs and offer digital clarity,
six-channel sound, instant rewind, and massive amounts of
information including trailers, screenplays, interviews and
databases.
</P>
<P>
   DVD players now retail for under $300; during the week before
Christmas, consumers bought half a million discs, according to
VideoScan, with most discs priced at $25. The DVD holiday bounty
led to a spate of positive announcements this week, including:
</P>
<P>
   Best Buy reported sales of $1.2 million in DVD software the day
after Christmas, while hardware sales at its 314 stores topped
80,000 units during November and December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong holiday sales of DVDs indicate that it is the preferred
format for future movie viewing,'' said Wade Fenn, Best Buy
executive vice president. ``DVD was by far the runaway consumer
electronics gift this year. By mid-December we sold out of many
models and were unable to fully meet demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Fenn said Best Buy could have sold another 20,000 units during
December.
</P>
<P>
   DVD Express, which bills itself as the Internet's largest video
retailer, announced it has sold 1 million discs and expects to pass
the 2 million mark by the second quarter with current shipments of
over 20,000 orders per week.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Dubelko, DVD Express president and founder, said, ``We
are now positioned for extraordinary growth as DVD completely
replaces VHS as the preferred format for premium home
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   DVD Express also launched an informational Web site, dvd.com,
with a content deal with The Hollywood Reporter to provide daily
industry news; and DuBelko said his firm had received 10,000 orders
for the ``Armageddon'' DVD in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros., the most aggressive studio in backing the format,
announced its 1998 DVD sales topped $170 million, more than triple
its sales of $50 million in 1997. DVD accounted for more than 10
percent of total domestic home video sales in the year and that
figure hit 18 percent in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``DVD's performance has exceeded expectations, and our numbers
prove it,'' said Warren Lieberfarb, president of Warner Home Video.
``DVD was a breakout hit during the holiday season, and we expect
consumer and retailer enthusiasm to experience continued growth in
1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Video announced DVD had become the most successful new
format introduction in the chain's history and will boost
inventories at some stores from 200 to 2,000 titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never has a new product launch at Hollywood been met with this
kind of demand,'' said Jeffrey Yapp, Hollywood Video president.
``DVD is the fastest growing new category we have ever
introduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City, which has backed the rival pay-per-view Divx
format, announced that retailers had sold 62,000 DVD players with
the Divx feature in December, about one third of the market. ``A
lot of people thought Divx would disappear after this holiday
season, but it's starting to catch on,'' Adams said. ``Our 10-year
model contains Divx; I've never had any doubt about the consumer
appeal of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City, for its part, is marketing Divx as an enhancement
to DVD. ``We believe that as our hardware and software selections
continue to grow and consumer awareness of DVD increases, Divx can
contribute to further expansion of the overall DVD market,'' said
Richard L. Sharp, chairman and chief executive officer of Circuit
City.
</P>
<P>
   The boom is being felt across the region: Los Angeles-based DVD
Express, for example, has gone from two full-time employees in
April 1997 to 100 currently; and Chatsworth, Calif.-based Image
Entertainment, the nation's largest laser disc distributor,
announced this week that its DVD software outsold laser discs by
2-to-1 during the holiday quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Image Entertainment, which expects online sales of
DVDs to become a ``major growth area,'' have more than doubled
since late November and closed Thursday at $9.375, down 18.75
cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really has become a DVD world,'' said Jeffrey Framer, Image
Entertainment's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson and the partnership backing Divx have developed a DVD
player for high-definition TVs that will be available next year;
Philips plans to roll out a DVD recorder next year.
</P>
<P>
   DVD Express' DuBelko predicts a much more broad-based audience
for DVD. ``At the beginning, our customers were 99 percent male,''
he said. ``Now we're about 70 percent male and we're starting to
see family titles sell really well.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBelko believes that DVD-ROM, now included in many new personal
computers, will be the next boom area for the format, followed by
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very dense format, with the equivalent (capacity) of 25
compact discs, and it's a market that's a $40 to $50 billion a year
business in North America,'' he said.!dlim!

AMAZON.COM IS ADDING A WAREHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the e-commerce pioneer whose stock price keeps
soaring even though it has yet to make a profit, announced Thursday
that it had leased a huge, highly mechanized warehouse near Reno, a
sign that it intends to expand its own distribution system for the
books, music CDs and videos it sells.
</P>
<P>
   The warehouse, formerly owned by Stanley Works, should help
Amazon.com increase its operating margins, several analysts said,
by capturing profits at both the retail and the distribution
levels.
</P>
<P>
   The move also suggests that Amazon.com has decided against
acquiring Baker &AMP; Taylor of Charlotte, N.C., the No. 2 book
distributor. Interest in Baker &AMP; Taylor rose after Amazon's main
competitor in online book sales, Barnes &AMP; Noble, said in November
that it would buy the biggest book distributor, Ingram Book Group
of Nashville, Tenn., for $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Cassar, an analyst at Jupiter Communications in New York, an
Internet strategic research concern, said that if Amazon.com ``is
as efficient as Ingram or Baker &AMP; Taylor, or almost as efficient,
then they can make the wholesaler's margin plus their own margin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their motivation with this warehouse is to increase their
gross margins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Amazon.com, the No. 1 online bookseller, added CDs and
videos, it moved from a line of products with thin profit margins
into two with even thinner margins.
</P>
<P>
   The warehouse deal was announced after the close of trading.
Shares of Amazon.com soared Thursday, reaching $160.25 before
closing at $158.875, up $20.875 for the day. Amazon shares are up
19-fold from a year ago, when they traded for $8.297.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Cooks Levitan, an analyst at BancBoston Robertson
Stephens in San Francisco, said Amazon.com was following the same
strategy as catalog companies that rely on distributors to fulfill
orders when they are small and then develop their own distribution
operations as they grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company that could not have existed without the
benefit of an Ingram,'' Ms. Levitan said. ``But now it makes sense
for them to build their own system because of their scale, because
they can meet customer demands quicker and for competitive reasons
now that Ingram will be part of Barnes &AMP; Noble.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ingram deal is under attack from independent bookstore
owners, who do not want to disclose competitive information to
Barnes &AMP; Noble, the operator of superstores, when they order books.
Barnes &AMP; Noble has said it will keep book-order data from
independent bookstores confidential within Ingram.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levitan said Amazon.com needed to increase sales to spread
its fixed costs over a much larger volume of sales before it could
turn a profit, which she said she did not expect until late next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com said Wednesday that its fourth-quarter sales were
$250 million, up from $66 million a year earlier. The company said
it shipped 7.5 million books, CDs and videos in the latest quarter,
collecting an average of $33 for each item shipped.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has had trouble fulfilling some orders, largely
because of limited warehouse space. To keep customers happy, it
absorbed the cost of overnight delivery for those who asked, Ms.
Levitan said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com operates a 93,000-square-foot distribution center in
Seattle, where it has its headquarters. In November 1997, the
company opened a 202,000-square-foot, or 4.4-acre, distribution
center in New Castle, Pa.

   The Nevada warehouse, which has nearly eight acres of space, is
owned by Panattoni Development, a Sacramento, Calif., real-estate
concern. Officials were unavailable for comment Thursday. The
warehouse is off Interstate 80, about 30 miles east of Reno, which
has become a major warehousing center for California in the last
two decades because Nevada reduced property taxes on business
inventories.

LEWIS'S WIDOW TO ALLEGE DOCTOR IGNORED WARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lawyers for the widow of Boston Celtics star Reggie
Lewis will argue in court that Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. disregarded
warnings from at least two colleagues that Lewis was suffering from
a more serious heart ailment than Mudge believed.
</P>
<P>
   In their motion and exhibits filed for an upcoming hearing in
the malpractice case, lawyers for Donna Harris-Lewis contend Mudge
was warned separately by a member of his own treatment team and a
noted cardiologist who had previously observed Lewis that Lewis's
heart showed signs of serious fluttering, which could be caused by
``electrophysiological'' problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore, we obviously have to bend over backwards to
ascertain as best we possibly can that Reggie does not have a
potentially lethal electrophysiological abnormality of the heart,''
Dr. Roman W. DeSanctis, director of Massachusetts General
Hospital's clinical cardiology unit, wrote to Mudge on May 7, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Three days before, Dr. Peter Friedman, a member of Mudge's
Brigham and Women's Hospital team that was treating Lewis, said
that his testing indicated that Lewis's fainting and feeling of
lightheadedness was the result of uncontrolled fluttering of the
heart. The options, Friedman advised, should be administering a
powerful drug that prevents such fluttering from taking place or
implanting a defibrillator into his abdomen that would correct his
heartbeat when it did flutter.
</P>
<P>
   According to his own notes, written May 4, 1993, Mudge supported
Friedman's contention that uncontrolled fluttering of the heart had
caused Lewis's fainting spells. He wrote that he had told the
Lewises about the options of taking medication and/or having a
defibrillator implanted to offset the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But less than a week later, on May 10, 1993, Mudge provided a
decidedly more optimistic view of Lewis's heart condition at a
press conference at the hospital. Lewis, he said, had ``a normal
athlete's heart with normal function.'' There was no evidence of
``cardiomyopathy'' (scarring of the heart tissue) or
``life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias'' (uncontolled
fluttering of the heart), Mudge said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mudge said Lewis was suffering from neurological reflex
in his body that caused his heart rate to slow down rather than
increase during periods of high exertion. The condition was
treatable with medication and would permit Lewis to return to
basketball, Mudge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am going to be doing is actually proving a negative;
proving that someone doesn't have a condition,'' Mudge said at the
press conference. ``That is, we have proved a negative, that he
does not have cardiomyopathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than three months later, Lewis suffered a fatal heart
attack while shooting baskets with friends at Brandeis University
in suburban Waltham. Subsequent tests showed that his heart tissue
was severely scarred.
</P>
<P>
   The malpractice suit filed in 1996 by Harris-Lewis, as executor
of Lewis's estate, charges that Mudge was derelict in failing to
diagnose her husband's condition. Mudge's defense lawyers contend
that he practiced good medicine in treating Lewis and any mistakes
he made were caused by the generally acknowledged difficulty in
diagnosing such scarring of the heart tissue.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mudge's lawyers have been trying to show that the
scarring of Lewis's heart was caused by his use of cocaine while a
student at Northeastern University, an allegation denied by
Harris-Lewis. But at least two former Northeastern officials,
athletic director Irwin Cohen and basketball coach Karl Fogel, have
testified they were told by the team doctor that Lewis had failed a
cocaine test in 1987. But the doctor, Dr. Job Fuchs, has testified
that Lewis had not failed the test.
</P>
<P>
   Although Northeastern is willing to turn over the report on its
investigation into the allegation that Lewis failed the cocaine
test, the university has asked that the lawyers keep the findings
confidential. Superior Court Judge Charles M. Grabau will hold a
hearing on the motions.
</P>
<P>
   In their motion to keep the report confidential, lawyers for
Harris-Lewis say that whether Lewis used cocaine is irrelevant to
the malpractice charge.

 JANE CUSHMAN, WRITER AND AGENT, DIES at 68  c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jane Clapperton Cushman, a writer and literary agent,
died on Dec. 30 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was
68 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said her son, Thomas Cushman of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Her company, the JCA Literary Agency, was founded by her
husband, John A.S. Cushman, in 1976; he died in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cushman was known for representing and encouraging young
first novelists. Her agency also represented authors like Richard
Rhodes, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1988 as well as a 1987 National
Book Award for ``The Making of the Atomic Bomb,'' and David Garrow,
whose ``Bearing the Cross'' won a Pulitzer in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cushman was born in Oxford, England. She graduated from
Somerville College at Oxford in 1952 and came to the United States
in 1960. She reviewed books for Cosmopolitan magazine, was an
editor at Crown and other publishing houses and wrote for magazines
in the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her son, she is survived by a sister, Amanda
Clapperton-Blake of London.

17 POETIC SYLLABLES TO SAY YOUR COMPUTER CRASHED
</HEADLINE>
   (See also Microsoft-Antitrust) (DW) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opening Thursday's session of the Microsoft
antitrust trial, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
advised the lawyers that he had recently been handed a news item
that, it turned out, had been circulating on the Internet in one
form or another for years.
</P>
<P>
   The fictitious article, which Jackson read into the court
record, purported to announce that Sony had come up with a new
operating system:
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of producing the cryptic error messages characteristic
of Microsoft's Windows 95, 3.1. and DOS operating systems, Sony's
chairman Asai Tawara said, `We intend to capture the high ground by
putting a human, Japanese face on what has been _ until now _ an
operating system that reflects Western cultural hegemony.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``For example,'' the article said, ``We have replaced the usual
impersonal and unhelpful Microsoft error messages with our own
Japanese haiku poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson then read some of the new kinds of error messages.
``Chaos reigns within. Reflect, repent, and reboot. Order shall
return.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First snow, then silence. This thousand dollar screen dies so
beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three things are certain: Death, taxes and lost data. Guess
which has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's favorite, he said, read:
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of memory. We wish to hold the whole sky, but we never
will.''

NAVAJO TRIBE PREPARES TO EMPTY ITS ZOO AT DIRECTION OF DEITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL DONOVAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINDOW ROCK _ For 36 years, the Navajo tribe has maintained its
own zoo, featuring reservation animals such as bears, coyotes,
snakes and elk.
</P>
<P>
   But now, following directions from mystical deities who
denounced the imprisonment of sacred animals, the tribe is poised
to empty the zoo into the wild.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has shocked zoo officials, who warn that most of the
animals would perish if released. They say they've been told the
animals might be released as early as today. (Friday, Jan. 8).
</P>
<P>
   The final decision will be made after a meeting today with
medicine men and will come in the wake of a reported December visit
by Navajo deities.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are saying that we should just release the animals
just don't realize what the consequences of that action will have
on the animals here,'' said Lolene Hathaway, the zoo director.
</P>
<P>
   The issue arose following accounts of a Dec. 26 visit by
traditional tribal deities to the remote community of Rocky Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   Though few details of the event have been released, the deities
reportedly expressed displeasure over the continued caging of
animals.
</P>
<P>
   There's been a growing movement for several years among
traditional tribal members to close down the zoo, which
traditionalists say violates Navajo tradition by imprisoning sacred
animals _ such as the coyote, bear and the golden eagle _ that were
meant to roam the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Navajo deities are spirit beings that control wheather a Navajo
is in harmony with nature or not.
</P>
<P>
   Navajos pray to the 20 or so deities because of a belief that if
the diety is not on your side bad things will happen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, two Navajo women in Rocky Ridge said they were visited
by two Navajo dieties that were upset because Navajos no longer
were praying to them or following the traditional ways.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Navajos visited the community following that
sighting, leaving corn pollen and saying prayers. A number of
tribal leaders also visited, including then-President Albert Hale,
who urged the government's 5,000 Navajo employees to visit the site
and gave them time off to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Gerri Harrison, legal counsel to Navajo Nation President Milton
Bluehouse, confirmed Thursday that Rocky Ridge residents had
informed the tribe of the deities' Dec. 26 return, when they
reportedly again urged Navajos to return to traditional ways and
mentioned the imprisonment of animals at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Link, who created the zoo in 1963 after a bear cub was
donated to the tribe, said he never saw any opposition from tribal
traditionalists during the 17 years he headed the zoo and the
tribal museum.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, ``Traditionalists would come in and offer
prayers to certain animals, primarily the bear, coyotes and the
eagles.''
</P>
<P>
   And three or four times a year, Link added, traditionalists
would visit the zoo before participating in a Coyote Way Ceremony,
which is done for healing purposes, to obtain corn pollen that had
been in a coyote's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Hathaway said people don't realize that most of the zoo animals
could not survive in the wild after being brought up in captivity
from birth. Others, like one of the zoo's eagles that has a broken
wing, are too damaged to survive on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison said that if it is decided to give the animals their
freedom, the medicine men would conduct a special ceremony to
protect themwhen they are returned to the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Hathaway said that although she is the zoo's director, she would
not have the power to stop the tribe from letting the animals go
free. However, she would inform the United States Department of
Agriculture, the federal agency that handles animal rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure that animal rights groups and officials for the USDA
would be appalled to hear about this,'' she said. &QL;

   BOSTON _ Lawyers for the widow of Boston Celtics star Reggie
Lewis will argue in court that Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. disregarded
warnings from at least two colleagues that Lewis was suffering from
a more serious heart ailment than Mudge believed.
</P>
<P>
   In their motion and exhibits filed for an upcoming hearing in
the malpractice case, lawyers for Donna Harris-Lewis contend Mudge
was warned separately by a member of his own treatment team and a
noted cardiologist who had previously observed Lewis that Lewis's
heart showed signs of serious fluttering, which could be caused by
``electrophysiological'' problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore, we obviously have to bend over backwards to
ascertain as best we possibly can that Reggie does not have a
potentially lethal electrophysiological abnormality of the heart,''
Dr. Roman W. DeSanctis, director of Massachusetts General
Hospital's clinical cardiology unit, wrote to Mudge on May 7, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Three days before, Dr. Peter Friedman, a member of Mudge's
Brigham and Women's Hospital team that was treating Lewis, said
that his testing indicated that Lewis's fainting and feeling of
lightheadedness was the result of uncontrolled fluttering of the
heart. The options, Friedman advised, should be administering a
powerful drug that prevents such fluttering from taking place or
implanting a defibrillator into his abdomen that would correct his
heartbeat when it did flutter.
</P>
<P>
   According to his own notes, written May 4, 1993, Mudge supported
Friedman's contention that uncontrolled fluttering of the heart had
caused Lewis's fainting spells. He wrote that he had told the
Lewises about the options of taking medication and/or having a
defibrillator implanted to offset the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But less than a week later, on May 10, 1993, Mudge provided a
decidedly more optimistic view of Lewis's heart condition at a
press conference at the hospital. Lewis, he said, had ``a normal
athlete's heart with normal function.'' There was no evidence of
``cardiomyopathy'' (scarring of the heart tissue) or
``life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias'' (uncontolled
fluttering of the heart), Mudge said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mudge said Lewis was suffering from neurological reflex
in his body that caused his heart rate to slow down rather than
increase during periods of high exertion. The condition was
treatable with medication and would permit Lewis to return to
basketball, Mudge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am going to be doing is actually proving a negative;
proving that someone doesn't have a condition,'' Mudge said at the
press conference. ``That is, we have proved a negative, that he
does not have cardiomyopathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than three months later, Lewis suffered a fatal heart
attack while shooting baskets with friends at Brandeis University
in suburban Waltham. Subsequent tests showed that his heart tissue
was severely scarred.
</P>
<P>
   The malpractice suit filed in 1996 by Harris-Lewis, as executor
of Lewis's estate, charges that Mudge was derelict in failing to
diagnose her husband's condition. Mudge's defense lawyers contend
that he practiced good medicine in treating Lewis and any mistakes
he made were caused by the generally acknowledged difficulty in
diagnosing such scarring of the heart tissue.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mudge's lawyers have been trying to show that the
scarring of Lewis's heart was caused by his use of cocaine while a
student at Northeastern University, an allegation denied by
Harris-Lewis. But at least two former Northeastern officials,
athletic director Irwin Cohen and basketball coach Karl Fogel, have
testified they were told by the team doctor that Lewis had failed a
cocaine test in 1987. But the doctor, Dr. Job Fuchs, has testified
that Lewis had not failed the test.
</P>
<P>
   Although Northeastern is willing to turn over the report on its
investigation into the allegation that Lewis failed the cocaine
test, the university has asked that the lawyers keep the findings
confidential. Superior Court Judge Charles M. Grabau will hold a
hearing on the motions.
</P>
<P>
   In their motion to keep the report confidential, lawyers for
Harris-Lewis say that whether Lewis used cocaine is irrelevant to
the malpractice charge.

CHICAGO OPTIONS EXCHANGE ENDS MERGER PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill.)  (js)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Chicago Board Options Exchange on Thursday
abandoned its planned merger with the Pacific Stock Exchange,
attributing the decision to pressing technological issues and
lingering antitrust questions.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, formulated last July, would have linked the world's
largest options exchange with a technologically savvy regional
stock exchange, allowing the combined outfit to better compete in
the rapidly consolidating world of financial exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, the American Stock Exchange and the National
Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the Nasdaq stock
market, united in the largest financial market combination ever,
and at a time when electronic trading is racing to the forefront,
many of the largest financial exchanges are searching for ways to
lower costs and to upgrade operations.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the Chicago Board Options Exchange said
Wednesday that their exchange simply did not have the time nor the
resources to follow through on the planned merger. Technical
staffers are grappling with Y2K, or year 2000, questions. Chicago
officials also said they were planning their own electronic trading
system to compete with the International Securities Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, William J. Brodsky, chairman of the Chicago
exchange, issued a release saying the canceled merger had little to
do with the merits of the plan or the Pacific Stock Exchange. But
the Justice Department's request for information and other pressing
matters meant that ``we must focus our efforts on other time
sensitive issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Stock Exchange also issued a release, simply saying
that it had been informed Thursday of the decision by the Chicago
exchange. Officials there had no other comment and did not say
whether the Pacific would seek another partner.
</P>
<P>
   While antitrust questions were cited, officials in Chicago said
the burden of answering those inquiries simply made it more
difficult to devote resources to expand trading capacity and work
on other matters. But there was not a sense that the merger would
have been halted by Justice Department officials. Justice
Department officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we began negotiating with the Pacific Exchange we thought
we'd have it done in a year,'' said Carol Kennedy, a Chicago
exchange spokeswoman. ``But now we have Y2K and we have to expand
capacity and switch to decimals. We just had a full plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials at the exchange said the planned merger also
posed difficulties. The Pacific is in San Francisco and it was
unclear how the two units would be merged, and what would happen to
the stock trading operation. The Pacific has also long planned to
build a new $150 million center in the San Francisco Bay area.

   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The theory has been around about as long as laces on the
football, maybe longer.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to have a football team that is entertaining, gets
great television ratings and sells tickets, find yourself great
offensive talent and get a really big scoreboard to handle all the
numbers your players can run up.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a football team that wins, get great defensive
talent.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, it would seem that this year's elite teams _ the
Minnesota Vikings in particular _ have shot holes into that
time-tested prevailing wisdom. The Vikings have made a 15-1 living
of outscoring opponents, and they have been so good at it that
their defense has been almost an afterthought. That's what happens
when your offense scores the most points in a single NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   But just because you average nearly 35 points per game doesn't
necessarily mean your team fast-breaks to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Vikings know this.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, you won't see the Purple People Eaters anywhere on the
field. But what the Vikings do have is an opportunistic defense
that knows how to keep enough pressure on the opponent,
particularly when working with what has become a consistent margin
for error provided by the Minnesota offense.
</P>
<P>
   And the Vikings will need their less-celebrated half to perform
just as it has all season if Minnesota is to embark on a Super Bowl
quest Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a veteran defense coming into this season,'' says coach
Dennis Green. ``These guys for the most part had been together for
a few years. And they have come together and played very well.
They've been a good unit. And blending a team is the difference
between having a bunch of good players and having a great team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense has gotten a lot of the attention. But our defense
has done the job, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, no matter how much attention the offense gets, the
defense is not underrated _ not by the Vikings' coaching staff,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   While the offensive firepower leaps out at fans and opponents
with names like Randy Moss, Cris Carter, Randall Cunningham and
Robert Smith, the defense merely does its job. John Randle and Ed
McDaniel have been wizards on the line, stopping the run in spite
of being a tad undersized.
</P>
<P>
   And rest assured, keeping the Cardinals' running game under
control is crucial this week.
</P>
<P>
   Only three teams in the NFC had better run-defense numbers than
the Vikings. They surrendered 100.9 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, this is a Catch-22 situation. The low number
partially is because the Vikings have a way of striking quickly on
offense. Invariably, their opponent is trying to come from behind,
which leads to abandoning the running game.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also a tribute to the Vikings' defenders. Their pass
defense allowed 215.8 yards per game during the regular season.
That ranked 10th in the conference, but it is better than San
Francisco and Atlanta, both of which still are alive in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And the bottom line _ points allowed _ is that Minnesota gave up
only 18.4 points per game. Only three teams in the NFC (and two in
the AFC) were more stingy.
</P>
<P>
   Why is dealing with the run critical to Minnesota's success
Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   Mainly because the Vikes' only loss this season was to Tampa
Bay, and it came when the Bucs were able to hammer out yardage with
a power running game. That makes Randle and McDaniel keys for
Minnesota in holding off Arizona's Adrian Murrell as well as the
scrambling exploits of quarterback Jake Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   Green says he believes the fact that all four remaining NFC
teams in the playoffs possess a 1,000-yard rusher is proof that
dealing with the running game is going to make all the difference
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened the past few years is that the emphasis on
the running game is really coming into play,'' Green says. ``You
don't have quite as many of the short passing attacks. And the
other thing is that a lot of the so-called West Coast offenses, a
lot of those coaches are no longer in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so now, you're getting much more balance. Everybody wants
to run the ball. Look at the teams in the playoffs now. They all
have strong runners. And they all have a 1,000-yard rusher (except
Miami, which saw Karim Abdul-Jabbar fall 40 yards short of
1,000).''
</P>
<P>
   While their defense tries to get noticed this week, the Vikings
also will be embarking on a mission that nobody else has been able
to finish _ to become the first team that plays home games in a
domed stadium to win the Super Bowl. Atlanta also will be trying to
be the first of the seven NFL teams that play in domes to win a
Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes it tough is getting home-field advantage,'' Green
says. ``No dome team has ever had home-field advantage all the way
through, either. Now, if you're able to get a good enough record to
get home-field advantage, then whoever plays in a dome, it becomes
irrelevant. I think that's our case this year, hopefully.

<P>
   ``We're not going to New York or San Francisco. If we're going
to win, we're going to win at our dome. The team was built to play
in this particular facility. So this gives us our best chance to
beat the Arizona Cardinals.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if the defense doesn't do it to Arizona, the
Metrodome won't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there's always that unprecedented offense to
fall back on.

NBA MOVES TO SALVAGE THE SEASON  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After the National Basketball Association's 29 owners
officially ensured labor peace for the next six years, Commissioner
David Stern was asked if he was bluffing when he said he would
scrap the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't pay to find out,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   In the same hotel conference room where the owners were
scheduled to vote on canceling the season, they instead unanimously
ratified a new collective bargaining agreement with the players as
the league continued its kiss-and-make-up-with-America tour
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by his deputy commissioner, Russ Granik, and Billy
Hunter, the union executive director, Stern shed some light on an
abbreviated season while also making a plea for renewed fan
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are painfully aware of the beating that professional
athletes and teams have taken at the hands of the public,'' he
said. ``We have talked about changing the paradigm. We have talked
to teams about understanding the history and what is going on. This
is the next step in that process. I ask you to judge us in a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said the season would start on Feb. 5, and teams will play
50 games, most of which will be intra-conference, though details
are being worked out. If Michael Jordan returns, the chance for
many Western Conference cities to see him are slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the schedule, I am sure that what we will end up
with is one that is much more conference-oriented than what we
normally have, largely for travel reasons,'' Granik said. ``Teams
will play most of their games, the vast majority, within their own
conference, although there will be some interconference play. A
team from the East may play only five or six teams from the West.
That is just the way the numbers are going to break out.''
</P>
<P>
   In a quest to win back fans, each team will play one exhibition
game at home and another away, with no admission charged.
</P>
<P>
   Stern added that beginning next season, at least 500 tickets for
every regular-season game will be held until game time and priced
at $10.
</P>
<P>
   The expected outcome at the board of governors meeting came
after players had approved the deal by a vote of 179 to 5 on
Wednesday. The lockout will remain until the agreement is in
written form, which could take 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned over the shape players would be in, the union and the
league agreed to open team facilities on Monday. Players will be
allowed to work with trainers, but not directly with coaches. The
hope was that the agreement could be reduced to writing by lawyers
by next week and the free agent signing period would begin by Jan.
18.
</P>
<P>
   The regular season will last through April, with the playoff
format unchanged. Granik said the NBA Finals should conclude by
June 29 or 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad this is over,'' Hunter said. ``Our players are
anxious to play, and we're anxious to join hands with David, Russ
and the owners of the 29 teams to really create a strong and
familial relationship _ one that will take the NBA to another level
and to bring back the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only regret I have is that is took us so long to get where
we are. We're glad to be back, and we'll do whatever we have to do
in order to demonstrate that.''
</P>
<P>
   The most debilitating labor war in league history _ the NBA had
not lost a game to work stoppage in 52 years before this season _
cost the players nearly $500 million in salaries. It ended
Wednesday morning after an all-night, 12-hour negotiating session
at the league offices.
</P>
<P>
   The owners emerged with the unprecedented concession of a
maximum limit on individual salaries. The days of one or two
players gobbling up a team's salary cap and making it impossible
for a franchise to sign a third star may be on the wane. Also, a
player's need for a prominent agent to get him the most lucrative
deal possible seemed to be reduced. But as to whether it would
dramatically change NBA economics, Stern was not prepared to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no certainty for us with respect to payrolls,'' Stern
said. ``That said, it was very important for us to come up with a
formula where teams could remain competitive. For us that was the
essence of what a sports league is _ competition. We think that
this is going to eliminate the movement because of economic
disparity.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the impact of the deal on agents, Hunter said: ``I
don't think this agreement is going to in any way negate the need
for agents. I know that when we were negotiating, it was never my
intent to do anything that would in any way negate that need. My
position is, the agents have been a significant support _ at least
to me _ in this process. Obviously, when you're trying to keep
400-500 ballplayers solidified, I still think there is going to be
a great need for agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond agents, general managers as well as league and team
attorneys are going to be busy beginning Jan. 18. A three-week
flurry of trades and free agent signings is expected to
significantly alter the playoff picture. More than 200 free agents
will be bid upon, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles
Barkley, Antonio McDyess and Jayson Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Once the games get started, players will be faced with an
exhausting schedule until playoffs start. Teams will be asked on
occasion to play three games in three nights, something that hasn't
happened in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it is going to be a mad scramble,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure NBC and Turner are compensated for missed games _ the
networks paid a combined $23 million to each team as part of their
broadcasting agreement _ several interconference games will be
retained.
</P>
<P>
   As the league tried to put back the pieces Thursday, though,
worrying about television seem almost trite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad to be back in the basketball business again,''
Granik said. &QL;

SENATE IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS BEGIN AMID PARTISAN BICKERING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Sub for editing throughout) 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate opened impeachment proceedings Thursday
against the president of the United States for the first time in
nearly 131 years, with all 100 senators swearing an oath to deliver
``impartial justice'' in the trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a somber ceremony setting the stage for a trial that could
begin next Thursday, the senators were sworn in as jurors by Chief
Justice of the United States William Rehnquist shortly after he
took an oath to preside fairly over the trial in the Senate
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The swearing-in ceremony followed an equally serious event in
which the 13 Republican ``House managers,'' who will serve as
prosecutors in the trial, presented the Senate with two articles of
impeachment against Clinton. The articles were approved by the
House on Dec. 19 and stemmed from Clinton's attempts to cover up an
affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The solemnity Thursday gave way to partisan bickering among
Republicans and Democrats, who could not agree on trial guidelines
even as they were taking an oath to sit in unbiased judgment of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Following a day of negotiations, Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., agreed to a
bipartisan meeting of all senators Friday morning to figure out, as
Lott put it, ``just how we ought to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the best way to keep calm and cool and dignified is
to talk to one another,'' Lott said at a joint news conference with
Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   He called on the American people to be patient as the Senate
navigates the ``uncharted waters'' of the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats earlier had refused to attend a meeting requested
by Lott, who hoped to fashion consensus to start the trial next
Thursday and end it sometime between Feb. 5 and Feb. 12. Lott also
refused to give in to Democratic demands that a limited time be set
for the trial and that no witnesses be subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   Under Lott's plan, the House prosecution team led by Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and Clinton's White House
legal team would be given five days each to make arguments.
Senators would then submit questions to them through Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   But Lott's plan leaves the door open to calling witnesses on a
case-by-case basis after the initial arguments, primarily because
of Hyde's insistence that first-hand testimony from Lewinsky and up
to 10 other witnesses might be integral to his presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has informed Republican senators that he would like to
present evidence that was not made public in the House impeachment
hearings last month.
</P>
<P>
   Along with many Democrats and the White House, some Republicans
are wary about calling witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, expressed reservations about how it
would play with the American people to have some of the more
well-known witnesses testifying live over television from the
Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have serious questions about bringing Monica Lewinsky to the
floor of the Senate,'' Stevens told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., also questioned why Hyde would
want to call key witnesses in the Senate trial when he declined to
do so in the impeachment hearings his committee held last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't necessary then, why is it necessary now,''
Kennedy said, suggesting that Republicans are simply trying to
further embarrass Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart warned that
``all bets are off'' for a quick and orderly trial if Republicans
insist on calling witnesses in a case that he said contains no
evidence that warrants Clinton's removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can make a compelling case to the American public
that there is no constitutional or legal foundation to move forward
with removing the president,'' he said, adding that an ``open-ended
process'' would likely result in ``countless delays.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that Hyde's committee ``had their chance'' to call
witnesses in the House hearings ``and took a pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart called on the Senate leaders to set ``clear rules of
the road'' before actually beginning the trial, saying that failure
to do so would create ``an environment that is manifestly unfair to
the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot have a process that's fair to someone involved in
that process where the rules get made up as you go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort move the process along, Lockhart said the president
would be willing to stipulate to 7,000 pages of grand jury
testimony and other evidence compiled by independent counsel
Kenneth Starr in his investigation of the Lewinsky matter if Hyde
would drop his demand for witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, called the proposal ``a step
in the right direction'' that would help shorten the list of
differences over what to allow into the trial. But she said members
should remain open to allowing witnesses to testify after each side
has a chance to present its case.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the confusion over how to carry on, the senators went
through the motions of beginning the trial process. They gathered
first to receive the articles of impeachment from the House in a
12-minute morning ceremony and then again in the afternoon for a
30-minute session in which Rehnquist, attired in his black judicial
robe, swore them in as jurors.
</P>
<P>
   As a Senate clerk called their names, each of the 100 senators
stood and said ``I do,'' when asked if they could pledge to do
``impartial justice'' in the case. Then each signed the Senate's
``book of oaths,'' normally reserved for recording the signatures
of new and re-elected lawmakers at each new Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Each lawmaker was allowed to keep the official black and silver
Senate pen he or she used, as a memento.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in his role as lead prosecutor, Hyde stood in the
Senate and read the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice
against Clinton. The 12 other Republican prosecutors appointed by
the House stood nearby.
</P>
<P>
   As Hyde ticked off an alleged pattern of lies and deceit he said
was aimed at covering up the president's illicit relationship with
Lewinsky, the senators sat grim-faced at their desks. Some took
notes, while others looked up occasionally into the visitor and
press galleries rimming the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution team entered the chamber in a single-file
procession after Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the president pro
tempore of the Senate, squawked at his colleagues to ``be in
order.'' But they were made to wait just inside the chamber door
while Lott and Daschle engaged in some last-minute haggling over
how the ceremony should proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Once that disagreement was settled, the 96-year-old Thurmond
instructed the Senate Sergeant at Arms James W. Ziglar to escort
Hyde and company to the well of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye. All persons are commanded to keep
silent, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives
is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of
impeachment against William Jefferson Clinton, president of the
United States,'' Ziglar read from a proclamation written in part by
the nation's founding fathers more than 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The historical precedent was set nearly 131 years ago, when the
Senate tried President Andrew Johnson in 1868 on three articles of
impeachment and acquitted him by one vote.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the nation was saddled with grave problems, and
the future of the country was in doubt. The Civil War had just
ended, not all southern states had rejoined the Union, and the
Republican-controlled Congress was upset with Johnson for his
Reconstruction policies. John was indicted on charges stemming from
his disagreements with Congress that fell well short of criminal
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The senators in the Clinton proceedings are being asked to
remove the president for lying under oath about an extramarital
affair.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats and Republicans believe that it will be virtually
impossible to get the 67 votes needed to convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lott reiterated Thursday that the Senate has a
constitutional obligation to carry through with a trial even though
the lawmakers charged with conducting it are wringing their hands
over how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Between ceremonies on the floor, Lott continued to hold
negotiations with Daschle, but many Democrats grew increasingly
angry at Lott for trying to accommodate Hyde's demand that he be
allowed to call witnesses. They saw Hyde's request as an attempt to
manage the trial proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Hyde is a fine human being, but I don't give a damn what
he thinks we should do. The next thing you know I'll be sitting in
a negotiating room and Ralph Reed will be sitting across the
table,'' Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., fumed to reporters. He was
referring to the former head of the Christian Coalition, a
Republican-based conservative group that has been intensely
critical of Clinton throughout his presidency.

HOUSTON WANTS KNICKS TO GET THE BALL ROLLING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ The gymnasium was as bare as a bachelor's
refrigerator. Just a couple of leftover souls. A group of students
had just filed out, and there was silence but for the faint sounds
of someone hulking about in the basement one flight below.
</P>
<P>
   It was Patrick Ewing. No suit and tie. No cellular phone.
Wearing a T-shirt and shorts, he was a solitary Knick working out
in the dank air of a small-college weight room Thursday, trying to
shed the pounds he had added while eating take-out through the
endless sedentary hours of negotiations as president of the players
union.
</P>
<P>
   He was understandably preoccupied during the National Basketball
Association's six-month lockout, which officially ended Thursday.
But what about the rest of the Knicks? During the labor dispute,
Allan Houston was one of the few regulars to show up at the
facility the Knicks were free to use, and he was the only teammate
to join Ewing Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live here and have a home here,'' Houston said Thursday.
``At the same time, if I'd lived here and played for a team in
another city, I would have been in that city to work out with my
teammates. This is your career. This is your job. And you have to
treat it like the season is going to start. This is what you're
paid to do, and I take it seriously. Everyone who could have been
should have been in town working out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are guys with obligations, and I respect that.
Like Chris Dudley, he has a newborn child. And there are guys with
house payments in other cities that have to be made and families to
be taken care of. Maybe it's easier for me since I'm here, but I
think you have to do whatever you can to work out together.''
</P>
<P>
   Players on several teams around the league, including on the
Indiana Pacers, have had at least semiregular workouts. Whether the
Knicks are left aching for more preparation will be determined when
their training camp opens on Jan. 18. They will not use Charleston,
S.C., as a getaway this year. They plan to use a facility near West
Hempstead on Long Island, for a week of two-a-days.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks will steel themselves for a rugged 50-game sprint _
filled with an occasional stretch of three games in three nights _
while attempting to re-sign point guard Charlie Ward and Dudley, a
reserve center. Although their options are limited to the use of
salary-cap exceptions, the Knicks may dabble in the free-agent
market. The loquacious Charles Barkley has expressed his desire to
play for the Knicks. But beyond free agency, the Knicks will have
to address several questions surrounding the 36-year-old Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   How will Ewing hold up? Faced with such a wearing schedule,
Knick Coach Jeff Van Gundy could opt to rest Ewing's knees in the
middle game of a back-to-back-to-back stretch. How is Ewing's
touch? After playing in only four games since crashing down on his
wrist on Dec. 20, 1997, Ewing will have precious little time to
find a smooth motion in a hand that is still healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working hard with my therapist on my hand,'' Ewing
said during a break in his workout Thursday. ``Eventually, I'll get
the strength and everything back. It feels fine, or as fine as it
can be. It's going to take a year and a half before it feels the
way it was before it was injured.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are not the same as before he was injured, either.
Charles Oakley has been replaced by Marcus Camby and Ewing is
certain to notice the difference.
</P>
<P>
   As Camby searches to fit in, so will the other Knicks. When
Ewing was sitting in street clothes, healing his wrist, last
season, the Knicks developed new leaders, Houston and Larry
Johnson, and discovered a different style.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look at it like we have one of the best centers of
all time back on the court,'' Houston said. ``And yet, at the same
time, none of us want to go back to where we were. We're going to
make it work. It's like we all have grown to a certain level and
now we have to meet each other.''
</P>
<P>
   For a team with so many familiar parts _ Ewing, Houston, Johnson
_ there is a sense of mystery about them. Because the players were
scattered around the country, working independently, neither the
coaches nor management knows what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been able to monitor them, of course,'' Ernie
Grunfeld, the Knicks' president, said. ``We have a good group of
guys, and hopefully everyone comes back in shape and ready to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a long and draining fight. And although the end did not
particularly please Ewing _ he said he was especially disappointed
in the rookie element of the deal _ he was nevertheless relieved it
was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go away for a while and take a vacation for a few
days,'' Ewing said. ``I just want to get away from everything,
clear my mind and get ready for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   He was discovered Thursday stirring in the basement of a
small-college gym. For Ewing and Houston, who was on Ewing's union
negotiating committee, being cloistered in the weight room
certainly beat a stuffy boardroom. On Friday, the Knicks' facility
will be open and the luxury amenities the Knicks are accustomed to
will be free for them to use.
</P>
<P>
   No official practice is scheduled. But players are allowed to
congregate on team turf now that the lockout is over. Just how many
Knicks take advantage of the opportunity for a group session before
camp opens is up to each individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lockout is over,'' Houston said. ``There are no more
excuses.'' &QL;

   The polls are clear. No matter who in Washington wants what, the
American public favors a drive-by impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   This is Congress No. 106. As is true with the Chicago Cubs,
however, this session looks like one more in a long series of
rebuilding years.
</P>
<P>
   The new House speaker, Denny Hastert, says he'll work for an end
to partisan fighting. Are you ready for nonpartisan fighting?
</P>
<P>
   Hastert broke tradition by not giving his first speech as
Speaker from the chair but from the floor. But he kept tradition by
not saying much.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Americans are restless people,'' Hastert says. Maybe once
more we need the kind of president Ronald Reagan was _ one who can
lead us in naps.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can count on me to be a workhorse,'' says Hastert. All in
favor say ``N-a-a-a-a-y.''
</P>
<P>
   Some senators have been predicting the Clinton trial could run
well into February. We've been hoping the same won't be true of
this January weather.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton wants Congress to let the Pentagon close more
domestic bases. Starting with the Kenneth Starr Air Force One Base?
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Baseball Writers' Association failed to
vote for Nolan Ryan or George Brett on their Hall of Fame ballot.
As managers, these guys would have slowed Ryan's delivery and
forced Brett to bunt each time up.

   &UR; NO-FAIL, NO-FAULT RESOLUTIONS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Since we are a full seven days into the new year, it's probably
safe to say that you have broken all or most of your New Year's
resolutions. This happened, of course, because all your resolutions
involved things you didn't really want to do or stop doing.
</P>
<P>
   Stop smoking, exercise more, stop eating like a pig ... all
these resolutions require tremendous willpower and, let's face it,
if you had that kind of willpower, you wouldn't be the wheezing,
lazy, slob you are today.
</P>
<P>
   It is much better, in my wheezing, lazy, slob opinion, to make
resolutions based on what you already want or don't want to do.
These resolutions have a much higher chance of success and are a
great way to bolster your self-esteem as you chain-smoke Marlboros
while lying on the couch stuffing your face with pork rinds.
</P>
<P>
   One of the resolutions I have made for myself this year is to
stop worrying about the Asian stock market. The fact that I worried
little if any about the Asian stock market last year dramatically
improves my chances of succeeding with this resolution this year.
Also, there are plenty of people who are paid to worry about the
Asian stock market, so volunteer worriers are hardly necessary.
This eliminates any feelings of guilt you may have and allows you
to devote more of your energies to smoking and snacking.
</P>
<P>
   Another resolution I have made is to give up any hope of
understanding what a ``browser'' is. The word ``browser'' popped up
often in stories about the Microsoft antitrust case (another
subject I have resolved to stop worrying about) last year but there
was seldom, if ever, any explanation as to what a browser might be,
leaving computer illiterates such as myself to imagine little old
men killing time in the public library while waiting for the first
seating at the early bird special.
</P>
<P>
   This cannot be true, of course, because the browsers in question
are worth billions and have much better things to do with their
time than nap in a public library with a copies of National
Geographic draped over their faces. Also, it would be hard to make
the browsers of my imagination small enough to fit inside those
little computer boxes, even with the aid of semiconductors,
whatever they are.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be irresponsible to abandon any hope of
understanding browsers, given the fact that the entire U.S. economy
is somehow dependent on them, I have no qualms whatsoever in making
a resolution to stop caring when or if the NBA strike is ever
resolved. I expect to have no trouble sticking with this resolution
for two very good reasons:
</P>
<P>
   1) I have less interest in pro basketball than I have in men's
figure skating, if you can imagine such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   2) It is hard to feel sorry for the team owners or the players,
both of whom are so rich they could probably buy the Asian stock
market and have enough left over for a browser or two.
</P>
<P>
   On a more personal level, I resolve to stop making excuses about
my backyard fence. My backyard fence has been in a state of what
could most charitably be described as ``disrepair'' for several
years now and is maybe one good wind storm away from disrepairing
into individual sawdust molecules randomly connected by a few
strands of rusting wire. Visitors, of course, notice the fence
first thing and often make helpful comments such as, ``Were you
aware you have an ugly, rotten fence in your back yard?'' or
``Isn't there some sort of county ordinance intended to punish
people like you?''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, I have apologized for the fence and promised that
it is on ``my list of things to do,'' knowing full well that such a
list does not exist and even if it did exist, fence replacement
would be a low priority, somewhere between ``add a second story''
and ``manually push the house 2 inches to the northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   I could come up with many other low-pressure New Year's
resolutions, but that would violate my last resolution, which is to
make fewer and shorter lists in 1999.

FIFTH YEAR MAY BE CHARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ By merely breaking from the starting gate in Sunday's
San Pasqual Handicap, Silver Charm will achieve something that
every other Kentucky Derby winner since Ferdinand (1986) and every
Derby-Preakness winner since Carry Back ('61) could not.
</P>
<P>
   He'll race as a 5-year-old, having avoided the medical and
economic demons that usually drive such valuable thoroughbreds into
early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   And if Silver Charm's season debut in the 1 1/16-mile San
Pasqual goes well, his handlers will quickly turn their aim to
greater distinctions, notably the Horse of the Year title and the
career earnings record.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Bob Baffert has proposed a high-flying schedule for
early 1999 that would take Silver Charm to Florida for the Jan. 30
Donn Handicap, back to California for the March 6 Santa Anita
Handicap and then to the United Arab Emirates for the March 28
Dubai World Cup, in which the horse would try to become the first
repeat winner. If he's still in one piece after all that,
presumably he would concentrate on the inaugural ``NTRA Champions
on Fox,'' the 11-race nationwide series for older horses that
includes the June 27 Hollywood Gold Cup and ends with the Aug. 29
Pacific Classic at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   But owner Bob Lewis refuses to look that far ahead. He won't be
goaded into copying Sonny and Carolyn Hine, who earned praise for
plotting and sticking to an ambitious '98 schedule for Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ludicrous to sit here in the first week of January and
attempt to schedule an entire campaign,'' said Lewis, who is
co-owner with his wife Beverly. ``It's an animal we're dealing
with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, for most horses, (the early-season plan) is a season and
a half in itself,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   The $200,000 San Pasqual could offer some competition if Silver
Charm, who has been sharp in recent workouts, isn't quite on his
game for his first race since winning the Nov. 27 Clark Handicap at
Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   The expected field of six includes Malek, the '98 Big 'Cap
winner who will run for the first time since a fourth-place finish
in Dubai last March, and Dramatic Gold, himself again after a
nine-month vacation. Silver Charm, ridden by Gary Stevens, was
assigned 125 pounds, 6 more than Malek, ridden by Alex Solis.
</P>
<P>
   With Skip Away and Breeders' Cup Classic winner Awesome Again
retired, Silver Charm is the clear leader of the nation's handicap
division.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewises and Baffert also have the consensus early favorite
for the May 1 Kentucky Derby in Exploit.
</P>
<P>
   And if his horses weren't reason enough for Bob Lewis to feel
optimistic about 1999, he's also a vocal supporter of the National
Thoroughbred Racing Association, the sport's new ``league office''
and its televised series of races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it gives (the sport) a great national and regional
approach,'' Lewis said from his office at Foothill Beverage in
Pomona. ``I think it's going to make great (news) copy.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't join in the criticism of the series format, which
requires a horse to finish in the top five of the Pacific Classic
to earn any bonus money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a loyal Californian and a devotee of Del Mar _ Beverly
and I honeymooned at the Del Mar races _ we're just thrilled,''
Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has seen high hopes dashed before, even during a '98
season in which Silver Charm won the Strub Stakes, the Dubai race
and four others, and led the nation's racehorses in earnings with
more than $4.6 million. Lewis calculated that by finishing second
in the '97 Santa Anita Derby and Belmont Stakes and the '98 Foster
Handicap and Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs, Silver Charm
has ``lost'' more money than he's earned.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, his career earnings of $6,513,006 put him within
range of the record established by Cigar ($9,998,815) from 1992-96
and threatened by Skip Away ($9,616,360) from 1995-98.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewises, whose Serena's Song set the fillies-and-mares
earnings record ($3,283,388), would love to have the leaders of
both genders. That's more for the honor of it than for the money,
since they could make more by retiring Silver Charm for breeding
than by continuing to race him.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he still plans to race Silver Charm at age 6 if he
stays healthy. ``I feel very strongly that we need to keep our
stars on the racetrack,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Silver Charm races at 6, he'll be the first Derby winner to
do that since Gato del Sol ('82) and the first Derby-Preakness
winner to do that since Citation ('48).
</P>
<P>
   The weekend: Saturday's headliner is the San Miguel, a 6-furlong
race for 3-year-olds that attracted only three opponents for Cape
Canaveral, an impressive winner in his Dec. 26 debut for trainer D.
Wayne Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the card is the Santa Ysabel, a 1 1/16-miler for
3-year-old fillies.
</P>
<P>
   Bettors without borders: The early response to full-card
simulcasting from out-of-state tracks has pleased Santa Anita
executives, who frankly didn't know what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprisingly, (it has done) as well as we'd guessed,'' said
Cliff Goodrich, Santa Anita's executive vice president and general
manager. ``It's just so hard to know when you've never done
something before.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans at Santa Anita and the harder-core players at the Southern
California satellites have wagered an average of about $800,000 a
day on races from Gulfstream Park in Florida and Aqueduct in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The California law that expanded simulcasting went into effect
Jan. 1. That day, more than $1.6 million was bet statewide on
Gulfstream and Aqueduct even though those races started at 9:30
a.m. PST. &QL;

   &UR; NO-FAIL, NO-FAULT RESOLUTIONS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GRIMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Since we are a full seven days into the new year, it's probably
safe to say that you have broken all or most of your New Year's
resolutions. This happened, of course, because all your resolutions
involved things you didn't really want to do or stop doing.
</P>
<P>
   Stop smoking, exercise more, stop eating like a pig ... all
these resolutions require tremendous willpower and, let's face it,
if you had that kind of willpower, you wouldn't be the wheezing,
lazy, slob you are today.
</P>
<P>
   It is much better, in my wheezing, lazy, slob opinion, to make
resolutions based on what you already want or don't want to do.
These resolutions have a much higher chance of success and are a
great way to bolster your self-esteem as you chain-smoke Marlboros
while lying on the couch stuffing your face with pork rinds.
</P>
<P>
   One of the resolutions I have made for myself this year is to
stop worrying about the Asian stock market. The fact that I worried
little if any about the Asian stock market last year dramatically
improves my chances of succeeding with this resolution this year.
Also, there are plenty of people who are paid to worry about the
Asian stock market, so volunteer worriers are hardly necessary.
This eliminates any feelings of guilt you may have and allows you
to devote more of your energies to smoking and snacking.
</P>
<P>
   Another resolution I have made is to give up any hope of
understanding what a ``browser'' is. The word ``browser'' popped up
often in stories about the Microsoft antitrust case (another
subject I have resolved to stop worrying about) last year but there
was seldom, if ever, any explanation as to what a browser might be,
leaving computer illiterates such as myself to imagine little old
men killing time in the public library while waiting for the first
seating at the early bird special.
</P>
<P>
   This cannot be true, of course, because the browsers in question
are worth billions and have much better things to do with their
time than nap in a public library with a copies of National
Geographic draped over their faces. Also, it would be hard to make
the browsers of my imagination small enough to fit inside those
little computer boxes, even with the aid of semiconductors,
whatever they are.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be irresponsible to abandon any hope of
understanding browsers, given the fact that the entire U.S. economy
is somehow dependent on them, I have no qualms whatsoever in making
a resolution to stop caring when or if the NBA strike is ever
resolved. I expect to have no trouble sticking with this resolution
for two very good reasons:
</P>
<P>
   1) I have less interest in pro basketball than I have in men's
figure skating, if you can imagine such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   2) It is hard to feel sorry for the team owners or the players,
both of whom are so rich they could probably buy the Asian stock
market and have enough left over for a browser or two.
</P>
<P>
   On a more personal level, I resolve to stop making excuses about
my backyard fence. My backyard fence has been in a state of what
could most charitably be described as ``disrepair'' for several
years now and is maybe one good wind storm away from disrepairing
into individual sawdust molecules randomly connected by a few
strands of rusting wire. Visitors, of course, notice the fence
first thing and often make helpful comments such as, ``Were you
aware you have an ugly, rotten fence in your back yard?'' or
``Isn't there some sort of county ordinance intended to punish
people like you?''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, I have apologized for the fence and promised that
it is on ``my list of things to do,'' knowing full well that such a
list does not exist and even if it did exist, fence replacement
would be a low priority, somewhere between ``add a second story''
and ``manually push the house 2 inches to the northeast.''
</P>
<P>
   I could come up with many other low-pressure New Year's
resolutions, but that would violate my last resolution, which is to
make fewer and shorter lists in 1999.

MCI WORLDCOM WEIGHS BID FOR AIRTOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom Inc., the No. 2 long-distance telephone carrier, is
considering joining the bidding for Airtouch Communications Inc.,
the big wireless phone company, executives close to the discussions
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom has contacted Airtouch but has not made a serious
offer, the executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp., the nation's No. 1 local phone company, and
Vodafone Group PLC, Britain's leading wireless carrier, are already
vying to acquire Airtouch for at least $45 billion. But in weighing
a bid, Bernard Ebbers, MCI Worldcom's chief executive, is unlikely
to be deterred by mere competition. After all, MCI Communications
Corp. had already agreed to merge with British Telecommunications
PLC in 1997 when Ebbers, then chairman of Worldcom Inc., stepped in
front of their altar.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, for Ebbers, making a bid for Airtouch would
represent a drastic change in direction. Unlike AT&AMP;T and Sprint,
the other long-distance giants, MCI Worldcom does not own a
significant wireless operation. Ebbers has said the company does
not need a wireless service in order to thrive in the
communications marketplace and that acquiring a wireless carrier
could overly dilute earnings.
</P>
<P>
   On at least a few occasions at conferences, Ebbers has been
asked why he has not acquired a wireless carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Show me an accretive wireless deal,'' he has sometimes
replied, to laughter.
</P>
<P>
   But investors were not laughing Thursday. Following a report in
USA Today that MCI Worldcom planned to bid more than $55 billion in
stock for Airtouch, MCI Worldcom's shares declined by $3.25, to
$75.125.
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers has shown in the past, however, that he will sacrifice
near-term earnings for long-term profit. Throughout the mid-1990s,
for instance, Ebbers said Worldcom would not do a dilutive deal.
But then in 1996, Worldcom acquired MFS Communications for $12
billion and that deal diluted Worldcom's earnings for at least a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Were MCI Worldcom to go after Airtouch, it would appear to be in
recognition that any full-service communications provider must
include wireless in its bundle of services. While MCI Worldcom has
not appeared to suffer for its lack of a wireless operation, signs
are beginning to emerge that the gap in the company's portfolio can
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, for instance, Sprint announced that it had
replaced MCI Worldcom as the telecommunications partner for
Northwest Airlines' frequent-flier program. Sprint executives said
Thursday that having a wireless service helped win the contract.
</P>
<P>
   One particularly Machiavellian theory circulating on Wall Street
Thursday was that MCI Worldcom was threatening to bid for Airtouch
in the hopes of encouraging Vodafone to strike a deal that would
make MCI Worldcom Vodafone's U.S. partner.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom did not comment.

JETS' ASSISTANT COACHES: 12 SILENT SOLDIERS BEHIND PARCELLS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Parcells, the tyrannical coach of the New York Jets,
demands as much from his assistant coaches as he does from his
players. He does not cut corners with them. There is little
sugar-coating.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Bill Belichick, his assistant head coach and close
friend. Both have toiled together for 13 National Football League
seasons with three different teams. But there was an occasion
during the last two seasons _ some Jets players said it happened in
practice, others said it also happened during a game on the
sideline _ where Parcells wanted Belichick to run the defense one
way and Belichick insisted on running it another way. Parcells was
incensed. Even in front of the other Jets coaches, in front of all
the Jets, Parcells did not cut corners. No sugar-coating.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you got fired in Cleveland!'' Parcells yelled at
Belichick. ``You think you know everything! That's why you won't be
a head coach again!''
</P>
<P>
   It was a profanity-laced tongue-lashing. This season, Parcells
has lauded Belichick publicly, applauding the entire staff, talking
about how essential they are and how loyal he is to them and they
are to him.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, even how he loves his guys.
</P>
<P>
   But he does not allow them to talk to reporters; not without his
approval. Parcells says one voice is enough and that voice will be
his.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews with current and former National Football
League personnel and current and former Jets who know Parcells'
staff, a mosaic is painted of the 12 Jets assistants who have stuck
with Parcells and have been a backbone to the team's success this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has orchestrated the Jets' majestic turnabout from 1-15
three years ago to the No.-2 seeded team in the playoffs and a home
game against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday. His assistant
coaches have watered the seeds. They represent 161 years of NFL
coaching experience _ an average of 13.4 years per man. The group
has 94 total years of coaching experience with Parcells _ an
average of 7.8 years a man.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is so far out in front that, with the notable exception
of Belichick, the rest of the group blends into the background.
Parcells is a superior head football coach. His system works
because there is an unusual bond between him and his assistants.
Understanding. Trust. With some of these coaches, just like with
some of the Jets players, there is also fear, fear of Parcells, not
only of his manner, but primarily in ruining their mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is that Bill Parcells wants to show the outside,
the public, only a certain amount of himself, only what he would
like for you to see,'' said Dennis Green, the Minnesota Vikings'
head coach. ``But his assistant coaches, they know him. They
realize he knows how to deal with and treat people behind closed
doors. No one truly knows what goes on behind those closed doors,
but outside, you can see that Bill coached for a few years and then
he left the game. And then when he came back, those same assistants
went running to be back with him. That tells you something. It's
respect. It's called working conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   It says that, for all of Parcells' nastiness, his assistants
know there are rewards. The rewards are success for the staff and
the team under Parcells' tutelage. Financial gain. And continuity
and consistency, even through Parcells' most blustery moments.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Parcells and Belichick have a right-hand man: for Parcells,
it is Charlie Weis, the offensive coordinator, and for Belichick it
is Eric Mangini, the defensive assistant and quality control coach.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most unheralded but absolutely critical coaches among
the assistants is Dan Henning, the quarterback coach. Henning has
coached 23 seasons in the NFL and was head coach of the Atlanta
Falcons (1983-'86) and the San Diego Chargers (1989-'91). Henning,
56, has ties to Sid Gilman and Joe Gibbs and other old-school
offensive geniuses. He is one of the most respected offensive minds
in football. Thus, it is believed by other coaches around the
league that Henning is involved heavily in offensive game-planning
and play-calling for the Jets. That he is a strong assist man for
Weis.
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious that Parcells looks for teachers in his
assistants. Up and down his lineup of assistants are excellent
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best is Romeo Crennel, the defensive line coach.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has never coached a season in the NFL without him.
Crennel is respected throughout the NFL for his even temperament
and his teaching. His linemen listen to him. They know that he
understands what it takes to excel. Many in pro football believe
Crennel will one day be an outstanding defensive coordinator and
then head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick has been called a ``football maniac'' for his
competitiveness, his feistiness and for his work ethic. Here is
what one of the current Jets said about Belichick:
</P>
<P>
   ``He is like a guru type guy who knows it all and who doesn't
have the greatest sense of humor. He's like a drill sergeant. He
doesn't mix well with people. But he can flip that around and fool
you; he can be funny and friendly and make you laugh. If you're a
smart player, you understand how to deal with him. If you're not,
then you will take some of the things he says to heart and wonder
if he even likes you. He challenges you with his knowledge. He
knows defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Mentally tough. That is Belichick in calling a defensive game,
in designing his defenses and in his requirement of the players who
implement them. Of the staff, Crennel, Maurice Carthon (running
backs) and Al Groh (linebackers) along with Belichick are among
those most likely to stand up to Parcells, several Jets players
said. They are among those most likely to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Carthon is credited for tutoring Adrian Murrell (now with
Arizona) and then Curtis Martin in the Jets backfield and not
skipping a beat even though both are distinctively different
runners. Carthon, 37, is young enough to identify strongly with the
players yet tough enough to be decisive and demanding. His
understanding of the running game, the vision and power needed, is
intricate. So, his teaching is much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Groh is considered to have a savvy football mind, a coach who
when he speaks can paint vivid pictures. It is believed that if
Belichick were to leave for any reason _ and the thinking among the
Jets is that he is eager to finally leave Parcells' shadow and next
season become a head coach again _ then Groh would run the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Muir, a 21-year NFL coach and the Jets offensive line
coach, is considered a student of the game. When computers became
rampant in pro football, Muir leaped forward, learning furiously,
incorporating computers into his teaching. His linemen say he is
always adding new ideas to his teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sweatman is a special teams coach who understands that
special teams play sets tempo. So does Parcells. So do the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Jets practices often begin with special teams walk-throughs.
Several of the Jets special teams players are backup defensive
players. And Sweatman used to be a linebackers coach. Thus, the
Jets special teams under Sweatman are especially physical.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Haley (offensive assistant/quality control), Pat Hodgson
(tight ends) and John Lott (strength and conditioning) round out
the crew.
</P>
<P>
   It is one hand-picked by Parcells. Nurtured by him. The Jets
team within the team.

WOMAN SHOT BY POLICE HAD HIGH BLOOD-ALCOHOL CONTENT 
</HEADLINE>

 By DON TERRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The young woman who was shot to death by police
officers as she sat in her disabled car about 60 miles east of here
in Riverside, Calif., was over the legal limit for blood alcohol
content, according to initial toxicology results released Thursday
by the Riverside County coroner's office.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Tyisha Miller, 19, was struck at least 12 times,
including four times in the head, when several Riverside police
officers opened fire in a gas station lot on Dec. 28. Police
officers have said she grabbed for a gun in her lap.
</P>
<P>
   According to the initial toxicology report, Ms. Miller's blood
alcohol level was .13, said Neil Lingle, the chief deputy in the
coroner's office. The legal limit in California is .08. The tests
also detected traces of Cannabinoids in Ms. Miller's system.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the authorities said that the officers fired only
after Ms. Miller had shot at them. But within hours, they said it
was unclear if she had fired and that the officers on the scene had
given conflicting accounts of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before the shooting, a cousin found Ms. Miller, either
asleep or unconscious, reclined behind the steering wheel of the
car, its windows rolled up, doors locked, the heat and the radio
blasting.
</P>
<P>
   The cousin, who went to the gas station to help Ms. Miller
repair a flat tire, was unable to rouse Ms. Miller and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   When the police arrived, the officers banged on the glass and
shouted for her to wake up, but again she failed to respond. Then
one officer, the police said, fearing that Ms. Miller was in
medical distress, broke the driver's side window with his
flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that as the glass shattered, Ms. Miller reached
for the gun, and fearing for their lives, they fired into the car.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In March, in a last-ditch attempt to uncover Saddam
Hussein's covert weapons and intelligence networks, the United
States used the U.N. inspection team to send an U.S. spy into
Baghdad to install a highly sophisticated electronic eavesdropping
system.
</P>
<P>
   The spy entered Iraq in the guise of a U.N. weapons inspector
and left the eavesdropping device behind.
</P>
<P>
   For nine months, the device let the United States and a select
elite within the U.N. inspection team monitor the cell phones,
walkie-talkies and other communications instruments used by the
military and intelligence officers who protect Saddam and conceal
Iraq's weapons.
</P>
<P>
   This operation, described Thursday by U.S. officials, is at the
center of the current furor over the relationship between U.S.
intelligence agents and inspectors with the U.N. Special
Commission, which is supposed to be independent and not pursue the
policy or intelligence goals of individual members.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials explained in some detail the origins of the
operation, making clear how U.S. intelligence came to dominate the
inspections in the months before the United States bombed Iraq. The
officials and others insisted that the eavesdropping operation was
not a unilateral, covert U.S. espionage gambit, and that it had the
blessing of Richard Butler, chairman of the commission, which is
known as UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not shock people that U.S. intelligence did
everything it could to help UNSCOM undermine'' Saddam, a senior
intelligence official said.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-five percent of what was overheard in Baghdad was
useless, another official said. But the rest led the weapons
inspectors to focus intensely on Iraq's hidden weapons programs and
security networks.
</P>
<P>
   That deep look inside Saddam's most precious military and
intelligence programs ended in December, when Baghdad expelled the
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, a four-day-long U.S.-led bombing campaign began.
Cruise missiles hit some targets selected from data gleaned by the
U.S.-led espionage, U.S. and U.N. officials said. But there is
little evidence that the bombing did permanent damage to Iraq's
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the officials spoke on the condition that they
would not be quoted directly. It appeared from their descriptions
that they believed the inspection team would never return to Iraq
in its original form.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors undertook their first electronic eavesdropping
three years ago. For the first two years, though it had some
success, its goal was frustrated by Iraqi security. In March it was
replaced by the U.S.-led effort.
</P>
<P>
   While some U.N. officials suspect that the effort was an U.S.
covert operation, U.S. officials insisted Thursday that a handful
of key UNSCOM officials approved the secret program.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the operation go back to 1995, after the
defection of an Iraqi general, Hussein Kamal. Kamal, a son-in-law
of Saddam, inexplicably returned to Iraq, apparently gripped by
remorse. He was promptly shot.
</P>
<P>
   But some aides who defected with him stayed out of Iraq. For the
past four years, they have provided the United States and UNSCOM
with a unique window into the Iraqi security apparatus, which had
successfully hidden Iraq's biological and chemical weapons programs
from the U.N. inspectors since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the United States and the United Nations
understood the depth and the sophistication of Iraqi security,
which includes thousands of officers commanded by the Special
Republican Guard, the Special Security Office and Saddam's personal
details. The most important target, they now understood, was a
sector of Iraq's Special Republican Guard known as the National
Monitoring Directorate.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was how to penetrate those networks.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. official said it was naive to assume that his
organization was innocent in espionage matters. ``The U.N. has been
and continues to be a focal point for espionage by everybody,'' he
said. Intelligence officers from most of the world's nations use
the organization as a base of operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rolf Ekeus, then the chairman of the U.N. inspections team,
needed help. He asked the United States to help him create a system
to listen in on the Iraqi security networks, many of which operated
at frequencies that U.S. spy planes and spy satellites could not
hear, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington did help, offering technology designed by the
National Security Agency and the CIA, which picked up Iraqi
telecommunications, beamed them to a computer in Bahrain and
filtered through the conversations for key words like ``missile''
or ``chemical.'' The information was shared with U.N. inspectors
and with other nations involved with the inspection effort _ though
not with Russia, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the CIA, several aspects of the program are
being withheld from publication to avoid assisting Iraqi
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout 1996 and 1997, the campaign was an international
effort, involving British, Israeli, Swedish, Polish and Australian
officers and officials, among others. The eavesdropping equipment
was brought into Iraq on each inspection mission, and used to
listen in as Iraqi security officers, speaking in code and using
scrambling devices, worked to conceal weapons and protect Saddam.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The U.S. officials said Ekeus did not want the effort to be
misread as a CIA operation, and that the United States did not take
the lead role, although ``we broke our backs to provide UNSCOM the
support it needed _ technology, equipment, people,'' as one said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, U.S. intelligence officials read everything gleaned
from the effort and distributed the intelligence to Pentagon
planners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we evaluate everything we got from UNSCOM? Of course,''
one said. U.S. spy agencies also interviewed inspectors
extensively, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, the commission had not succeeded in unmasking
Iraq's hidden programs. It was then, last March, that the United
States inserted its sophisticated device into the U.N. operation,
and assumed the lead role in the espionage. It restricted the
information gathered to a very small circle of senior U.N.
inspection officials. They barred Scott Ritter, the U.S. military
officer who had led UNSCOM's earlier effort to unmask Iraq's covert
weaponry and whom they suspected as a security risk.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insisted that the information they gathered was
only what the commission needed _ insight into the ways in which
Iraq concealed its weapons. But they conceded that those very same
methods were used by Iraq to protect its president.
</P>
<P>
   It should be no surprise, they said, that U.S. cruise missiles
were aimed last month at the same people and institutions that the
eavesdropping campaign tried to penetrate _ including the home of
the man who runs the security organizations that protect Iraq's
secret weapons and Saddam Hussein.

   BC-BLACK-FARMERS-NYT (Moved on Tuesday, Jan. 5)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Tuesday, Jan. 5,
about the Agriculture Department's settlement of a discrimination
lawsuit filed by black farmers in 1997 referred incorrectly to
bonuses offered some black farmers after the Civil War. Although
Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman set aside thousands of acres of
confiscated and abandoned land in Georgia and South Carolina for
settlement by blacks, with each family also receiving an Army mule
to work it _ a program known as ``40 acres and a mule'' _ the offer
was canceled by President Andrew Johnson, who returned the property
to its prewar owners.

   BC-JEFFERSON-HEMINGS-NYT (moved on Wednesday, Jan. 6)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Wednesday, Jan. 6,
about DNA evidence that Thomas Jefferson fathered a child with a
slave, Sally Hemings, omitted a historian's reply in some editions
to a charge that racist thinking motivated some historians who
discount the possibility. The historian, Joseph J. Ellis, who
studied Jefferson, said that before the DNA testing, there had been
evidence on both sides of the issue. Further, he said, historians
note that most of Jefferson's contemporaries dismissed the
fatherhood account, and he said it was hard for many historians to
believe Jefferson would have persisted in such a liaison after
having been publicly accused of it.
</P>
<P>
   Also because of an editing error, the article gave an incomplete
name in some editions for the author who has accused the
historians. She is Annette Gordon-Reed, a lawyer who has written
about the evidence.

   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, Dec. 28,
about the new Governor of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura, misidentified
the sponsor of a poll that found that more people would vote for
Mr. Ventura today than did in November. It was conducted by The St.
Paul Pioneer Press, not The Star Tribune in Minneapolis.

<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Wednesday, Jan. 6,
about William H. Luers, the departing president of the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, misstated the relationship between his position and
that of Philippe de Montebello, the museum's director. The two have
been equal, both reporting to the chairman; the director is not
subordinate to the president. As the article noted, Mr. de
Montebello will assume the additional title of chief executive on

TV SPORTS: EXCITED TO BE HEADED BACK TO THE SIDELINE
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When TNT returns to televising National Basketball Association
games on Feb. 5, Hubie Brown will be ready. The cable network's
lead analyst has run clinics throughout the United States and
abroad to stay busy during the lockout. He watched a lot of college
basketball and envisioned himself at courtside, but TNT and TBS,
its Turner Sports sister network, carry no collegiate games.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as doing clinics in Italy, Spain and Argentina sounds
glamorous, you say, `Hallelujah!' when you're back at work, chained
to a chair, with the best seat in the house,'' Brown, the former
New York Knicks coach, said Thursday. ``You miss it when your life
has always been basketball and you have a passion for what you do.
I like the preparation, the games and having a great seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Also excited by returning to work is John Andariese, who is
shifting to call Knicks games on radio for WFAN from the television
side on the MSG Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent more time with my day job, played a lot of
basketball, worked out more to get in better shape and watched
college basketball,'' said Andariese, an executive of a company
that sells commercial television time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get into a routine doing games,'' he added, enthused that
as the radio analyst, he will call every game, beside Marv Albert,
and will not lose games to accommodate NBC, as MSG does. ``It's a
life you feed off of. It's not normal, but there's an energy flow
from the intense schedule. You miss the general excitement of the
game. It's a war out there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The schedules will become unusually tense. To cram more games
into a shortened time frame, interconference matchups will be
reduced and regional rivalries enhanced. TNT will probably start
with a doubleheader on opening night _ the old schedule had two
Western Conference games, Phoenix-Seattle and Houston-Los Angeles _
while NBC will return with a tripleheader on Feb. 7. TBS's Monday
schedule will start on Feb. 8, and TNT will return the next night
to begin its Tuesday slate. The Turner services could add games on
other nights to accommodate the stepped-up schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a drastic cut in Eastern-Western Conference games, NBC
and Turner will undoubtedly seek their share of Sunday Bulls-Jazz
or Knicks-Lakers games during scheduling talks with the league
today.
</P>
<P>
   There is palpable relief at NBC, Turner and the Fox Sports Net,
which carries the local cable telecasts of 26 or the 29 NBA teams,
that a 50-game season was salvaged. The NBA is marquee programming,
a lucrative outlet for advertisers seeking young male viewers. NBC
and Turner have already paid 40 percent of their combined $465
million in 1998-99 rights payments, which were guaranteed even if
the season was canceled. None of the FSN outlets, including Fox
Sports New York, had paid its teams anything in advance.
</P>
<P>
   A canceled season would have meant a loss of advertising, most
of which flows in during the playoffs. Last season, NBC's gross NBA
advertising totaled $427.7 million, according to Competitive Media
Reporting, an ad-tracking service. Another $138.9 million went to
TNT and TBS.
</P>
<P>
   About one-quarter of Turner's NBA advertisers fled TNT and TBS
during the lockout to find male viewers on pro football or college
sports telecasts.
</P>
<P>
   This won't be a normal return to business for any NBA television
outlet. Fan apathy, a shortened season and the possible retirement
of Michael Jordan could dampen demographically desirable ratings. A
season of replacement programming thrilled no one, however; taped
skiing events can't compare with NBA games on NBC. Having no NBA
games to lead in to its revamped prime-time sports news program,
now anchored by Keith Olbermann, frustrated FSN.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to replace the Bulls in Chicago and the Lakers in
Los Angeles and their ratings,'' said Arthur Smith, FSN's executive
vice president. ``No one benefits more by the settlement than we do
because we do more games.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratings may take as much time to recover as it will take Shawn
Kemp to lose his massive gut. ``I'd be crazy to say there's been no
damage,'' said Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports. ``This
will be a serious, long-term process that may even extend into next
year. But I don't think it will take three or four years like
baseball to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the league was working on a television promotional
campaign that would ``address with humor the tough times we've been
through.''
</P>
<P>
   The slogan? How about ``David Stern-Billy Hunter _ I Love Their
Game?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Everybody realizes you have a season that's an aberration,''
said Bob Costas, who is entering his second year as NBC's lead
play-by-play announcer. ``No one can deny it's been diminished.''
He hopes for legitimate reasons to show genuine excitement about
the games he will call with Doug Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope the quality of play will be high,'' he said. ``But if
the games are flat, and the season is flat, it's more difficult for
the broadcasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Much may depend on Jordan. NBC will surely load up on Bulls
games, but if Jordan retires, most of the broadcasts will not be
carried nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, more regional games will be scheduled, Ebersol said.
``We'll have to do it,'' he said. ``But I'm not saying it will be a
smile on our faces.'' &QL;

SENATE TRIAL BEGINS   AMID DISCORD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With pomp and high purpose, the US Senate on
Thursday opened the first presidential impeachment trial in 131
years as a tumultuous dispute roiled outside the chamber over the
course of the landmark proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The donnybrook lasted into the night, when party leaders,
declaring a truce and pleading for the public's patience, vowed to
renew the struggle Friday as they prepared to decide President
Clinton's fate.
</P>
<P>
   With the parties widely split over the length and scope of the
trial, their leaders scheduled a rare, private meeting Friday
morning of all 100 senators in a last-ditch effort to end the
standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a resolution, which members of both parties considered
unlikely, the Senate was expected to vote Friday on two competing
plans _ a Republican proposal that would allow witnesses or a
Democratic outline for a shorter trial with no witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown unfolded as the senators, compelled by
constitutional duty but riven by partisan concerns, took oaths as
jurors to consider whether Clinton should be the first president
removed from office for ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary event unfolded on dual tracks. One moment,
Senate jurors were heeding a centuries-old command to ``keep silent
on pain of imprisonment'' during the solemn trial. Moments later,
and for hours afterward, the lawmakers were wrangling throughout
the Capitol over how to conduct the trial.
</P>
<P>
   After a long day of fits and starts, and one emergency meeting
after another, party leaders abruptly canceled a vote Thursday
night on the competing proposals and expressed hope that another
round of discussions would help bridge the partisan gulf.
</P>
<P>
   All 100 senators were scheduled to hold their final negotiations
Friday in the Old Senate Chamber in the Capitol, the scene of some
of the most dramatic speeches and confrontations in the decade
before the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, nothing is sure,'' said the Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott, in a news conference Thursday night with his
Democratic counterpart, Thomas A. Daschle. ``We're definite about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The intense negotiations were driven largely by concern,
particularly among Senate Republicans, of keeping the trial from
veering into a bitter, partisan free-for-all, as the first stage of
the impeachment process did last month in the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Lott was enduring enormous pressure from the 13
House members who will serve as managers, or prosecutors, in the
Senate trial _ all conservative Republicans, who pressed
successfully for Clinton's impeachment on a narrow, party-line vote
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're struggling very hard to do that,'' Lott said of reaching
a bipartisan plan, ``and we're asking for the indulgence of the
American people so we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the first president to be impeached by the House since Andrew
Johnson in 1868, Clinton faces two articles charging that he lied
under oath and obstructed justice to try to cover up his sexual
affair in the White House with a former intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans want the House managers and Clinton's lawyers
each to take up to 24 hours over three days to make their cases,
with House managers beginning on Jan. 14 and the White House on
Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   After the presentations, senators would ask questions of both
sides on Jan. 22 and Jan. 23, then vote on Jan. 25 on how many
witnesses, if any, they would permit the House managers to call.
The managers have said they want to call as many as 15 witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Each side would have eight hours to present closing arguments,
the House managers on Jan. 28 and Clinton's lawyers on Jan. 29. The
Senate would hold a closed-door debate on the articles of
impeachment on Jan. 30, and vote on acquittal or conviction on Feb.
2.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan also would require the White House to submit a
written brief of its arguments by Jan. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats, almost unanimously opposed to hearing
witnesses in the case, want to give the House managers two days _
Jan. 12 and Jan. 13 _ to make their case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic plan would also give Clinton's lawyers two days _
Jan. 14 and Jan. 15 _ to rebut the charges, then allot two more
days _ Jan. 19 and 20 _ for senators to question both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Each side would be given three hours for a closing argument on
Jan. 21, and senators would hold their final deliberations from
Jan. 22 through Jan. 25, before voting on the impeachment charges
on Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is our very strong and very preferred position for very
strong constitutional and institutional reasons,'' said Senator
John F. Kerry of Massachusetts, a member of the Democratic
leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   ``And our view probably won't change,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who
supports the Democratic plan, left open the possibility that the
trial could end without votes on the articles of impeachment. He
said the process could be shut down after both sides present their
cases if a senator makes a motion to adjourn the proceedings or to
decide whether the articles, if proven, even reach the standard to
remove a president from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important now is that we have the process concluded in
a timely way and get a resoluton of this,'' Kennedy said. ``The
earlier the better for the country, for the Senate, and the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Many GOP senators said they were willing to continue seeking a
possible compromise, as did Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, we have to get to a point where people think
like jurors, not as Republicans or Democrats,'' said Senator Ted
Stevens, an Alaska Republican who was part of a bipartisan group
that negotiated with the House managers and White House lawyers in
an unsuccessful effort to forge a trial plan.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Susan M. Collins, a Maine Republican, said Friday's
conference could be pivotal to ending the stalemate. ``I think
these procedural issues are resolvable in a bipartisan way, and
that's what we're going to try to do,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the issue is resolved, the Senate will be unable to meet
its obligation to serve Clinton a summons informing him that the
trial has begun and setting a time for his lawyers to respond.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joseph Lockhart said Clinton's
lawyers were prepared to make concessions to hasten the
proceedings, including accepting as fact many of the assertions in
the House impeachment report, if the Senate will agree not to call
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are convinced we can make a compelling case that will lead
the United States Senate not to remove the president,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate satisfies the House request to call witnesses,
Lockhart said, the process could be prolonged indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   At the Senate, Democrats were poised to blame the House
Republican team for infecting the proceedings with partisanship
with their insistence to call witnesses such as Lewinsky and
Clinton's personal secretary, Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forces preventing the bipartisanship are the same that
played out in the House,'' said Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a
Louisiana Democrat. ``They are represented by the group of House
members that don't represent the mainstream of the American
public.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans blasted one of the newest Democratic
senators, Charles E. Schumer of New York, who voted against the
impeachment articles as a member of the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took Chuck Schumer less than one day in office to break his
solemn oath to be impartial,'' said Jim Nicholson, chairman of the
Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Although senators dragged their negotiations into the Senate
chamber, even delaying their swearing-in by Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist by nearly 20 minutes, many were struck by the gravity
of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said: ``This is my 37th January in the Senate, and I
have always felt it to be a time of hope and optimism. Friday is a
day of solemnity and sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the hurly-burly outside the chamber, Senator Carl Levin, a
Michigan Democrat who has served in the Senate for 20 years,
described the scene as ``surreal.''

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Cash payments were made by local Olympic
officials to members of the International Olympic Committee during
this city's bid to be awarded the 2002 Winter Games, according to
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   One investigator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
individual payments ranged from $5,000 to $70,000 and were made to
IOC members from Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator said the payments appeared to have come from
the Salt Lake City bid committee's $14 million, privately funded
operating budget, although the official said investigators were
still trying to determine the exact number of payments, the dollar
amounts and the full roster of recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators cautioned that the reasons for the payments
were not yet known and that it was possible some might be explained
as legitimate reimbursement for travel expenses or as money
earmarked for humanitarian aid such as athletic equipment or
training programs.
</P>
<P>
   The normal channels for making humanitarian contributions are
through an IOC program called Solidarity or through national
Olympic committees, not through individuals, although some IOC
members serve as presidents of their national Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they were trying to determine whether any of
the payments _ possible inducements apart from anything already
uncovered in the unfolding scandal _ occurred during the IOC
session in June 1995 in Budapest, Hungary, where Salt Lake City won
the 2002 Winter Games in a landslide vote over Ostersund, Sweden;
Sion, Switzerland; and Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   If investigators determine that the payments were made in an
effort to buy votes, the scandal here, already a profound
embarrassment to the city as well as to international Olympic
officials, will be raised a significant level.
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City Olympic officials have previously acknowledged
spending nearly $400,000 on a tuition-payment and athletic-training
program that benefited 13 people, six of whom were relatives of IOC
members, most from Africa. Salt Lake City officials described these
programs as humanitarian aid, not bribery. But investigators said
they were trying to determine if some of those tuition payments
went to relatives of IOC members who then never attended school.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have also discovered that $28,000 worth of medical
services were provided through the bid committee for three people
with apparent Olympic connections.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Welch, who was president of the Salt Lake City Olympic bid
committee, has acknowledged giving items such as shotguns and skis
to IOC members, favors that exceeded the $150 limit on gifts set by
the U.S. Olympic Committee. But he has called this kind of
gift-giving commonplace and has said Salt Lake City did not do
anything that other Olympic-bid cities had not done.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated calls made to Welch have not been returned in recent
days, and he did not answer the door at his condominium in Park
City.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said it might prove impossible to determine
whether any of Salt Lake City's efforts in fact produced the
desired votes, as the 114 members of the IOC who decide on the
sites for the Games cast secret ballots. Moreover, the vote in 1995
was not close, as Salt Lake City won easily on the first ballot.
(Salt Lake City had 54 votes; Sion and Ostersund 14 each, and
Quebec 7.)
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, it is also unclear to investigators whether such
a scheme would constitute a violation of any state or federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff at the organizing committee is not getting updates
from any investigator on what they might or might not be finding,''
said Shelley Thomas, a spokeswoman for the Salt Lake City
organizing committee. ``These are more reasons why we are hoping
for quick conclusions and solid answers as to what happened during
the bidding process.''
</P>
<P>
   There are four separate investigations under way into Salt Lake
City's efforts to secure the Olympics, including inquiries by the
IOC, the USOC, the U.S. Justice Department and an internal Salt
Lake City ethics panel. All four investigations were prompted by
bribery charges made last month by Marc Hodler, a senior IOC
official from Switzerland who alleged that similar vote-buying
efforts had been made in many prior selection processes.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC has announced that it will not strip Salt Lake City of
the 2002 Games. But executives of the USOC, concerned about shaken
corporate and public confidence in the Olympic movement and faced
with having to raise more than $200 million in a joint operating
agreement to reach Salt Lake City's budget of $1.45 billion for the
2002 Games, have been meeting this week with Gov. Mike Leavitt of
Utah in an effort to try and rebuild public support.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has called on the private organizing committee to
place top Salt Lake City Olympic officials on administrative leave
during the four investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials familiar with Salt Lake City's bid for the
2002 Winter Games have described in recent weeks a process by which
Salt Lake City Olympic officials targeted the votes of 17 African
IOC members after losing by four votes to Nagano, Japan, for the
right to play host to the 1998 Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their thinking was that they had lost the Olympic Games to a
bloc of African votes that had been purchased by others,'' said one
Olympic official familiar with the bid process, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``They were bound and determined not to
allow that to happen again. That's what started them down the
slippery slope.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodler, the Swiss IOC official, has said that as many as 25 of
the 114 IOC members may have sold their votes in recent elections
to name Olympic cities, and has said that agents, or middlemen,
demand up to $1 million to secure blocs of votes and then charge
the winning city $3 million to $5 million for their services.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of such extravagant demands has not surfaced, but in
the weeks since Hodler made his charges, a number of Olympic
officials have supported the notion that cities bidding on the
Olympics sometimes go too far in providing gifts and services and
that some members of the IOC have their hands out in expectation of
receiving lavish favors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Washington, there are checks and balances in government;
but the IOC is not responsible to any constituency,'' said Robert
Helmick, a former member of the IOC and president of the U.S.
Olympic Committee who resigned in 1991 in a conflict-of-interest
scandal. ``Their excesses are allowed to go virtually unchecked.
That type of situation leads to corruption.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Helmick has accused Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the
IOC, of not being forceful enough in policing the excesses of
committee members. In an interview, Helmick spoke of IOC members
being taken on fur-coat and jewelry shopping sprees worth $3,000 to
$8,000 while visiting bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1991 IOC session in Birmingham, England, where the 1998
Winter Games were awarded to Nagano over Salt Lake City, the IOC
set up its own parcel-post station so that its members could mail
their load of gifts home, Helmick said.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Knapp, a member of the USOC's executive committee, said
that some of the criticism of Salt Lake City seemed hypocritical,
and added that she believed the city was being made a scapegoat by
the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can people who made this into an art form turn around and
say, `Oh, those bums,''' Knapp said. ``They knew it was Christmas
every day. It's amazing how they can ignore what has been common
knowledge and expect to have any credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Before their successful bid for the 2002 Games, Salt Lake City
had bid on the Winter Olympics four times over a period of 25 years
and lost every time. Local officials approached the 2002 Winter
Games with tempered confidence that their fifth bid would be a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Many Olympic officials, in the United States and elsewhere,
believe that Salt Lake City would have won the 1998 Winter Games,
if another American city, Atlanta, had not been awarded the 1996
Summer Olympics. It had a superior bid in terms of sports
facilities and infrastructure. In losing by only four votes to
Nagano for 1998, according to American Olympic officials, Salt Lake
City felt it was given a clear message by the IOC: ``Stay in
another four years and you will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake City officials also received another message,
according to John Ruger, a member of the board of directors of the
Salt Lake City and U.S. Olympic committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our people saw the largesse coming from Japan,'' Ruger
said. ``Japanese corporations had contributed to building the IOC
museum. There were rumors of diamond rings. I think our people saw
one bid committee doing something and thought they had to do a
little more. They didn't want to lose again. They got caught up in
that. I think it's a climate we've got to stop. The Salt Lake City
bid committee definitely made mistakes and was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Needing more than 50 votes to claim a majority among IOC members
and to become host in 2002, Salt Lake City would have to maintain a
wide base of international support. But the Salt Lake City bid
committee, according to investigators as well as officials familiar
with its effort, paid close attention to one area that could prove
to be critical: Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Africa had never hosted any Olympic Games, and its IOC members
had no vested interest in where winter competitions were held. The
bid committee calculated that the North Americans would be divided
between Salt Lake City and Quebec, while the European vote seemed
likely to be split by two other competitors: Sion, Switzerland, and
Ostersund, Sweden. There were 17 potentially decisive African votes
at stake.
</P>
<P>
   There has long been a perception among some Olympic officials
that African IOC members vote as a bloc, although this is
impossible to know, because the ballot is secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the record will show that there was a concerted effort
by some members from Africa who sought support for themselves from
this bid committee,'' said an Olympic official familiar with the
Salt Lake City bid.
</P>
<P>
   In shaping Salt Lake City's Africa strategy, local officials
relied in part on the advice and vast connections of Andrew Young,
the former ambassador to the United Nations who was chairman of the
Atlanta Olympic bid committee and was vital in securing the 1996
Summer Games. Young said he told Salt Lake City officials that they
should travel to visit every IOC member personally and that they
should provide athletic training aid when possible in developing
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The local point man for Africa was Bennie Smith, a former
football player at Brigham Young University who is president of a
Salt Lake City construction company. He is also black, which the
overwhelmingly white Salt Lake City bid committee, according to
American Olympic officials familiar with the process, felt would be
advantageous in dealing with IOC members from Africa. Smith has
declined to speak to reporters about the vote-buying charges.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Young, however, were not the only people enlisted to
boost Salt Lake City's cause. Salt Lake City officials have
acknowledged that Mahmoud El Farnawani, a former national
volleyball coach in Egypt, was paid $58,000 by the Salt Lake City
bid committee in 1994 for his assistance in providing access to IOC
members from North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   And there was, too, direct financial assistance provided to
African IOC members and their families. In 1991, after losing to
Nagano, Salt Lake City began a program of tuition and athletic
training assistance that continued until the fall of 1998. In a
mid-December interview Welch described the scholarship program as a
legitimate effort in the Olympic tradition of a rich nation helping
poorer, less developed nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt this was one of the roles we could play to improve an
understanding of who we were, and we could be of help,'' said
Welch, who resigned in 1997 as president of the Salt Lake City
Olympic organizing committee after pleading no contest to a
misdemeanor charge of spousal battery. ``Most cities didn't bid as
long as Salt Lake. These people were our friends. I think we became
part of the Olympic family.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though the program has been defended as humanitarian aid, there
was potential strategic value to Salt Lake City's aid.
</P>
<P>
   One scholarship went to the daughter of Rene Essomba, an IOC
member from Cameroon who, until he died last year, was executive
director of the national Olympic committees of Africa. The Salt
Lake City scandal broke last November when a local television
station was leaked a 1996 letter from Dave Johnson, a top Salt Lake
City Olympic official, to Sonia Essomba, saying that a $10,000
tuition payment would be her last.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Claude Ganga, an IOC member from Congo Republic and former
ambassador to China, received free treatment for hepatitis in Salt
Lake City, one investigator said. Ganga holds influence as the
president of the national Olympic committees of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they were examining a $60,000 profit made by
Ganga, which was first reported by The Associated Press, from a
land deal arranged by Smith three months after the Games site was
chosen.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a third IOC member from Africa, David Sibandze of the
tiny kingdom of Swaziland, worked as an intern in City Hall in Salt
Lake City during its bid for the 2002 Winter Games. The son also
received tuition assistance from local Olympic officials, an
investigator said, while he attended the University of Utah, where
he received bachelor's and master's degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Sibandze, the owner of a fast-food business in Swaziland who has
eight children, has been linked to scholarship offers and medical
services in three other recent Olympic bid cities. He said he did
not know if his son received tuition aid from Salt Lake City
officials, but he added: ``Education is education. If you want your
child to be educated, you try everything you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Ramsamy, the president of the South African Olympic
Committee, has cautioned against assuming that IOC members from
Africa are susceptible to corruption. Other Olympic officials said
it was important to realize that the Olympic movement involves many
cultures, and things that seem inappropriate in one culture are
considered appropriate in other cultures.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Young said that while he did not know about the
scholarships and free medical care, he considered these programs to
be a show of Olympic generosity and solidarity, not bribery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any problem with people educating anybody,
anytime, for any reason,'' Young said, adding that ``this is one of
the things that levels the playing field, not corrupts it.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the IOC have declined to publicly chastise other
members. Privately, though, several said they found it disturbing
that any member would benefit personally from a city bidding on the
Winter or Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   Gerhard Heiberg, an IOC member from Norway, said in an interview
that one or more members of the committee should be expelled ``to
show that we are serious and to prevent this from happening
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodler has identified El Farnawani, who lives in a Toronto
suburb, as an agent who offered to sell blocs of votes for money.
El Farnawani was quoted in a Toronto newspaper in 1995 as saying
that he had ``assured'' the North African vote to Salt Lake City
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, however, El Farnawani said he offered only
access to IOC members from North Africa, not guarantees. He could
not guarantee a bloc of votes, because the voting is done by secret
ballot, he said. A bid city would be foolish to pay him an
exorbitant amount of money to deliver a bloc of votes, he said,
because he could never prove that he had delivered the votes.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Bashir Mohamed Attarabulsi, the IOC member from
Libya, has acknowledged receiving tuition aid to two Utah
universities from Salt Lake City Olympic officials from 1995 until
last October.
</P>
<P>
   El Farnawani, who described Bashir Attarabulsi as a good friend
and a very religious man, said that Attarabulsi was concerned about
the propriety of tuition aid but saw the scholarship as a way to
keep his younger son from having to join an older brother in the
Libyan army.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach the Attarabulsis for comment were
unsuccessful. In his only comment, Suhel Attarabulsi denied to the
Deseret News of Salt Lake City that his father had sold his vote
for the tuition aid.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Ball, a member of the bid committee, said his worst concern
now was that ``people assume wrongly that we bought this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We won on the first ballot, on merit,'' Ball said. ``But
that's not the perception.''

end of a strike, fearful they had been hammered by the school
board, I have the slightest difficulty brooding about our tall
friends.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, I don't think the National Basketball
Association players want our condescension or our sympathy at the
end of the lockout dispute. I can hardly wait until they flaunt
their fur cloaks and their gold accessories at us, because then I
will know things are back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   The players deserve what they make, as talented performers. They
also have mouths to feed, just like coal miners and school
teachers, even though it may not look that way to the public.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear to me that the players got whacked that badly in
the settlement, which was ratified by the league's board of
governors Thursday. And as the son of two union activists, I
respect unions too much to give gratuitous advice about standing up
to the big bullies from ownership and staying out all year.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it would have been jolly fun to watch the look on Kindly
Uncle David's face when the players blew up the season and he had
to explain to his owners how he miscalculated the mood of the
workers. And wouldn't it have been fun seeing the sign ``Tractor
Pull Tonight'' out in front of Madison Square Garden?
</P>
<P>
   Good things have come out of this contract: Those madcap
impulsive owners have now been officially restrained from
overpaying the next wave of rookies.
</P>
<P>
   The players, through whatever group dynamics within their
association, decided they have a pretty good deal going, and why
wreck it. It says a lot about the million-dollar salaries that the
players can live with a pro-rated 50-game salary, but the 82-game
season is too long as it is.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the players had responsibilities. I'm sorry, but
that's a fact. Everybody laughed at Patrick Ewing for his bumbling
statements about the owners trying to take food out of his mouth,
but all of life is a struggle, and sometimes the most responsible
thing to do is pack a couple of sandwiches in the lunch bucket and
get back to the mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to get a fair deal,'' said Billy Hunter, the
executive director of the players' association. ``We don't need
ideologues telling us what to do. Players are going to be making
$80-90-100 million under this contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter was sitting on the same dais as Stern and Russ Granik,
the deputy commissioner, after the governors had voted to bring the
slam dunk back to the deprived world. The class war, with its
whispers of racial attitudes between white owners and predominately
black labor, was now over, and these guys were acting like
respectful protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody in the media suggested that Hunter and the union had
been beaten down by the owners, Stern shook his head from side to
side, and said, ``Most of the board meeting was spent explaining to
the governors the differences between the old offer and what was
won by the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, to a small group, Stern said, ``The owners had their
limit at 53 percent, but it is my prerogative to suggest other
limits,'' which, ultimately came to 55 percent going to players'
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   True, Stern had been applauded by some players when he visited
their headquarters during the settlement, but when Hunter had paid
his respects to the owners after ratification Thursday, ``No
applause was asked for or offered,'' reported Stan Kasten of the
Atlanta Hawks, himself a gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   Does the imbalance of applause mean the players were craven
laborers who had caved in to the power structure? No, it probably
means the players have better manners than the owners.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of decency, it has been easy, during this six-month
lockout, to ridicule the players for their extravagances, as well
as the brash behavior of the younger set. I would also suggest that
the vast majority of NBA players are generously passing some of
their huge salaries to mothers and other family members and friends
who are somewhat better than hangers-on.
</P>
<P>
   I am hardly from the Ronald Reagan trickle-down school of
economics, but I do believe roofs are being built and groceries are
being bought with some of this money now being generated because
the players knew it was time to go back and take care of themselves
and their families.

ANDERSON'S FANCY FOOTWORK IS LEGENDARY 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jamal Anderson was teasing two of his teammates
about their dancing, or so the story goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fools, that's not how you do it,'' the Atlanta Falcons
tailback bayed. Feigning exasperation, he hopped to his feet and
illustrated the correct way to get down.
</P>
<P>
   The boogie night in question did not take place earlier this
season in Atlanta. It wasn't tight end O.J. Santiago or left tackle
Bob Whitfield who saw the first snippets of the touchdown dance
that is currently all the rage in what is otherwise considered the
South's most sophisticated city.
</P>
<P>
   Long before he flaunted his fowl footwork for a Falcons team
that bills itself as the ``Dirty Birds,'' Anderson was playing way
off Broadway, at Moorpark College. It was there, in 1990 and '91,
that the running back showed off the moves and the moxie that would
metamorphose a moribund NFL franchise in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamal used to try to teach us how to dance in his room,''
recalled Corey Tucker, the quarterback on the 1991 Raiders team
that finished 10-2 and beat Pierce College in the Western State
Bowl. Tucker, strong safety Melvin Nunnery and Anderson were
inseparable that season and remain close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't that great of a dancer,'' Tucker said, laughing.
``None of us were.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker had forgotten how it was Anderson who reminded him of
Seinfeld's Elaine Benes. Then he was watching highlights of the
Falcons' 31-19 win over the San Francisco 49ers in mid-November and
he saw his friend go spasmodic in the end zone twice.
</P>
<P>
   He paged him that same day and left a voice mail that was about
as subtle as Anderson himself: ``What in the world is that dance
you're doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 26, called him back and explained that every nickname
needs a dance. After all, where would the Rockettes be without
their kicking line? The former Woodland Hills resident takes credit
for the choreography; raise your palms toward the sky, stick your
thumbs in your armpits and flap them while breaking out into
something that vaguely resembles Michael Jackson's moonwalk.
</P>
<P>
   But Santiago was the one who actually unveiled ``The Dirty
Bird'' during the Falcons' win at New England on Nov. 8. Anderson
simply made it famous the following week against the Niners with
his typically impeccable timing.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons and 49ers meet again Saturday _ Atlanta's first home
playoff game since 1980 _ with the winner advancing to the NFC
title game. It wouldn't surprise us if Niners safety Merton Hanks,
who made ``The Chicken Dance'' famous, is having a recurring dream
this week about being devoured by some stubborn salmonella wearing
a No.32 jersey and a sly smile.
</P>
<P>
   At the Georgia Dome on Nov. 15, Anderson ran over Hanks and,
with Hanks riding piggyback, rumbled for a 10-yard touchdown in the
second quarter to break a scoreless tie.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's old pal Nunnery knew better than most that Hanks
might as well have been trying to stop a tidal wave. Nunnery
co-captained the 1991 Moorpark team with Anderson. They didn't go
up against each other much at practice, which was probably just as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the guys known for hurting people,'' Nunnery
recalled. ``One time I did go up against Jamal and he ran me over.
When that happened, everybody knew he was The Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson knew it way before everybody else and he wasn't shy
about broadcasting it.
</P>
<P>
   With his father at his side, he walked into the office of
Moorpark coach Jim Bittner unannounced at the start of the 1990
fall term and pronounced that he had come to the school to be a
running back. Never mind that he had been an All-City linebacker at
El Camino Real High and that the Raiders already had a running back
named Freddie Bradley that everybody could see was the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson left his office that day, Bittner chuckled at the
kid's mettle. The inner confidence that things would happen for him
``is the thing that really set Jamal apart from other people,''
Bittner said.
</P>
<P>
   Too, there were the tree-trunk legs tapering to ballerina's feet
that enabled Anderson to do pirouettes around people or plow them
down with equal ease.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson shared the backfield with Bradley as a freshman and
gained more than 1,000 yards as a sophomore, his current success
none-too-subtly foreshadowed by a 64-yard touchdown run on a fake
punt (that Anderson himself called) in the fourth quarter of a 63-3
blowout of archrival Ventura College late in his sophomore season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about that run to this day,'' Tucker said. ``It was
something else. He ran over six people. I mean, he really punished
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Bittner took a lot of heat. What could the coach say
to the people who accused him of running up the score? That he
didn't call the play, the kid did? That he left Anderson alone when
he saw what he was planning to do because he thought, ``What can it
hurt? They're going to tackle him anyhow.''
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of that run, which looked just as impressive on
the videotapes mailed off to colleges as it did in person, Anderson
earned an athletic scholarship to Utah. Before he left he bragged
to people that Salt Lake City was an intermediate stop to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks Jamal's cocky,'' Nunnery said. ``But he just
knows what he wants to do and he's willing to work hard to get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Anderson, fresh off a 1,002-yard season, was shooting
the breeze with Oprah Winfrey on a show that brought together some
of the country's most eligible bachelors. At one point he boldly
predicted he would run for more than 1,500 yards in 1998. So when
he gained 1,846 yards, the ninth-highest NFL single-season total,
on an NFL-record 410 carries it didn't surprise Nunnery one bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamal likes to put himself on the line because it forces him
to perform and he thrives on pressure,'' Nunnery said. ``If Jamal
tells somebody he'll be the MVP of the Super Bowl and score three
touchdowns, I fully expect it'll happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's posturing could get to be a royal pain, except that
his heart is so big it dwarfs his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamal was always, like, a savior,'' said Tucker, who
remembered walking out to the Moorpark practice field early in his
freshman year and being accosted by a couple of big, beefy
teammates intent on taping his skinny frame to the goalpost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Jamal who came to my rescue,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after that, a teammate committed suicide. He was a
great guy, Tucker said, but he never played in any games so a lot
of people didn't bother to get to know him. Anderson had befriended
him and he made sure everybody had a ride to the young man's
funeral and that every player went to the family's house afterward
to offer condolences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was mandatory,'' Nunnery said, ``because Jamal made it
so.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what a warm, wonderful human being Anderson was, Tucker
said: ``In goal line situations, coach Bittner would call one play
and I'd audibilize and give the ball to Jamal just so he could be
the one to score because he was so nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Some seven years later, nothing has changed but the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard not to keep up with what he's doing when
every other channel I click on, there he is,'' Tucker said. ``I'm
like, yeah, I used to hand the ball off to that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The friendship of the three Moorpark Raiders is as smooth as a
handoff, their conversation picking up right where they left off
whenever Anderson hooks up with Tucker and Nunnery during his trips
to the Valley to visit his parents James and Zenobia.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker and Nunnery won't be seeing Anderson until much later
this year, probably not until after the Pro Bowl. But they know
what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamal's the same as he ever was,'' Nunnery said. ``Except we
have to be a little more careful. We can't act a fool like we used
to in public because people recognize Jamal now.'' &QL;

 Very Soon, eBay Insiders Will Be Free to Trade Their Shares  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
EBay's effervescent stock could possibly fizzle _ at least a little
_ once the online auctioneer's shares are unshackled later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, eBay has been one of the shining stars of the
electronic commerce revolution. After just several months on the
market, its shares are trading at an astronomical 16.6 times their
initial public offering price of $18. In fact, eBay helped energize
the then-moribund IPO market by being among the first Internet
offerings to go public in the wake of last summer's financial
market collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Yet like most new public companies, eBbay will soon face the end
of its lock-up period _ a stretch of time after an IPO when
insiders (usually management and early investors) are restricted
from selling their shares.
</P>
<P>
   Stock underwriters commonly require lock-ups in their IPO deals
to prevent insiders from flooding the market with their holdings
shortly after institutional investors have purchased newly minted
shares.
</P>
<P>
   And after taking the cuffs off, insider selling could increase
the float _ the amount of shares available for purchase. By
increasing the supply of shares, the stock price usually _ but not
always _ goes down for a spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember when the end of a lock-up gave a stock a
lift. It just doesn't seem to happen often,'' says Kevin Landis, a
technology portfolio manager for Firsthand Funds of San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   In eBay's case, more than 24.5 million shares will be unlocked
and available to be traded on January 22. That compares with its
currently thin float of 3.5 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the insiders who own it are itching to sell, it can make
for a bumpy ride,'' Landis warns.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to where we last left the insiders at eBay. In
an earlier column, Street Smarts reported that eBay's lock-up was
unusually short, giving pre-IPO investors and management a chance
to unload their common shares about two months earlier than
underwriters usually require.
</P>
<P>
   While at first glance this might seem pedantic, it was truly
extraordinary because it signaled that somebody seemed antsy to
sell. And why not?
</P>
<P>
   If you earned more than 16 times your original investment, you
might be inclined to take some profits, too.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET08 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Still, it implies that some early investors with intimate
knowledge of the company may not be in it for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   It mattered enough to eBay's board that the company negotiate an
abbreviated lock-up.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, eBay was in a position to make demands from bankers
because, among other things, it was a real business that was
already posting profits prior to going public.
</P>
<P>
   And in Internet terms, that's a slam-dunk IPO prospect. (In the
end, Goldman Sachs won the contest to be the lead manager.) &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Now, it remains to be seen whether eBay insiders will take some
profits after a successful holiday shopping season and whether new
investors _ most likely online Net stock zealots _ will pick up the
slack.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OOPS. NEVER MIND &LR; : Hey, we're all entitled to change our minds
about a new gig. But we usually don't sell our house first. Over
the holidays, 36-year-old Patrick Allen decided that he wanted his
old job back as chief financial officer of San Francisco's
Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   As was reported in this column, Allen previously announced that
he was quitting H&AMP;Q to work for another former employer: Cruttenden
Roth in Irvine. The new job offered more responsibilities and a
chance for his family to return to their beloved Newport Beach. Or
so he thought.
</P>
<P>
   But something happened between the closing on the sale of his
Marin crib and moving back to the beach. For his part, Allen simply
says he experienced a change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically realized that the big opportunity was (at H&AMP;Q) and
this was the right thing to do ... except for the fact that I'm now
homeless,'' Allen says.
</P>
<P>
   But people familiar with the situation suggest there was more to
it than that. They say his return wasn't prompted by any dramatic
reversal by H&AMP;Q to change his job description or prime his
compensation package.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they suggest that the young CFO might have been spooked
by something at Cruttenden. Cruttenden Chairman Byron Roth would
only say that he was very disappointed that Allen didn't stay at
the Orange County investment firm.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ The Rockets' Leslie Alexander isn't exactly one of the
NBA's more high-profile owners.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, about the only time Alexander is seen in front of a
camera or microphone is when he is accepting another championship
trophy or when he is speaking about one of his many charities.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander was a definite player in the league's efforts to
work out a new collective-bargaining agreement with the National
Basketball Players Association. Alexander, who sat on the owners'
labor-relations committee, was in the conference rooms, discussing
_ and, yes, arguing at times _ the several proposals that were
swapped over the course of the six-month lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander and the other owners have been unable to speak
publicly about the lockout during the past six months, but the
league's gag order was lifted Thursday, so Alexander sat down with
the Chronicle and discussed his views on the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When the owners instituted the lockout, did you have any idea
it would drag on this long?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, I thought we'd come to terms quicker than this. But when
you look over the history of labor disputes, they usually last
longer than people thought they would last. Usually, things in life
last longer than you think they would.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Considering the upward spiral of salaries over the last two
or three years, how imperative was it for the owners to regain
financial control of the league?
</P>
<P>
   A. If we hadn't had a deal, the way the escalation of salaries
had gone, teams would have been bankrupted. And the league would
have had tremendous trouble having a competitive league, where all
teams are able to compete. And that would have been horrible for
the NBA _ the players, the owners and the fans. This was a win for
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you ever think you were actually going to lose an entire
season of NBA basketball?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, there was trepidation that might happen, which is almost
inconceivable. But at the end, you always think about what is the
worst thing that could possibly happen. That would have been
destructive to everybody, and that part we thought about, but you
had no choice if you wanted to have a league where everybody could
compete and we'd be able to go on without it being an absurd level
of salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's your assessment of the final collective-bargaining
agreement? Did the owners win? Did the players win?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's a fair deal for both sides. The players are going to do
great. They're going to make oodles of money, and there's more room
for the (middle- and lower-class players). I'd say that 85 percent
of the players will do better in this deal because there are going
to be more lower-level exceptions, where guys can make $1.5
million, $2 million a year, and in some cases even $4 million a
year. For the owners, it gives us a level of certainty _ we know
how much we can pay a player at the top end, and we keep our
rookies longer. Those won't really guarantee that we'll make money
but will give us a shot in the future to have a chance to make
money. The other way (with the previous collective-bargaining
agreement), there was no shot (to make money) and we were all going
to lose money, almost.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Fans will have a hard time understanding all that went into
the lockout and even why there was a lockout. But when you look
down the line, maybe two years from now, do you think the fans will
come to understand that it was something the owners thought was
absolutely necessary?
</P>
<P>
   A. One of the things I think about is when I walk into a game,
when I see the Rockets play, the one thing I'm always rooting for
is triple overtime and then we win at the last second, at the
buzzer. I love basketball, and I love competitive games, and I want
to see the league be competitive. I want the Rockets to be
competitive and to be able to go after players and win
championships year after year. Unless we had this deal, that would
never have happened.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You often talk about how much of a fan you are. How do you
separate Leslie Alexander, the fan, from Leslie Alexander, the
owner and businessman, when you walk into the negotiating room?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's an interesting point. When I first bought this team, I
was thinking, ``Boy, this is great.'' I got to talk about trades
and things like that. As a fan, that's all you think about when
you're growing up. As a sports fan, when you're older, you're
always thinking about, ``Who can we get for that guy or for that
guy?'' That's part of what's so much fun about sports. And then you
start doing it (as an owner), and you see the financial
consequences, and you see how making a mistake like that could
devastate your team and devastate the city. So (the perspective)
has changed over time.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there a part of the final agreement that you didn't
necessarily want but had to OK because it was best to get a new
collective-bargaining agreement done?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. I don't want to talk about (specifics), but there were
things in this deal that hurt me and hurt the Rockets in the short
term, but for the benefit of the league everybody had to give.
</P>
<P>
   Q. After months of labor negotiations, which often were bitter
and sometimes got personal, how does the league now recapture a
good working relationship with the players?
</P>
<P>
   A. David Stern went over to the Players Association (meeting on
Wednesday) and addressed them, and they were warm and receptive.
They (the players) were hugging, and everybody was happy. And
(Thursday) at the end of our (Board of Governors) meeting (union
executive director) Billy Hunter came over and addressed us. Billy
and David (Stern) are going to work together to repair whatever
damage that we have done.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And now comes the hard part, building a team. Is that going
to be difficult, given that you have only four players under
contract and that you're only going to have a couple of weeks to
put a team together?
</P>
<P>
   A. Definitely. We have to get into free agency _ we have to get
players. We're one of the teams that has the fewest players signed
of any in the whole league.
</P>
<P>
   Q. And, finally, was it worth it? Was it worth enduring a
six-month lockout that almost cost the season?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, it was definitely worth it. For the competitive balance
and the future of the league, it was definitely worth it. There was
no other choice.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a hushed chamber under heavy security, Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist opened the first presidential
impeachment trial in 131 years on Thursday, swearing in senators to
``do impartial justice'' in judging whether President William
Jefferson Clinton should be removed from office for perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The trial of the nation's 42nd president formally began as
senators struggled through another day, searching for a way around
the impasse between the two parties over whether to call witnesses.
The mood swung wildly throughout the day. Bipartisan bonhomie in
the morning gave way to recriminations that left the parties at the
brink of a showdown vote over competing trial plans in the late
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But desperately trying to stave off the rancorous partisanship
of the House, the two parties pulled back from the confrontation
and planned an unusual joint caucus of all 100 senators in the
Capitol's rarely used ceremonial Old Senate Chamber on Friday.
Sens. Trent Lott, the majority leader, and Tom Daschle, the
minority leader, appeared together on Thursday night to announce
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the best way to keep cool and calm and dignified is
to hear each other and talk to each other,'' Lott said. ``Now does
that solve all the problems? No.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press secretary,
said the president's lawyers would ``make a compelling case that
will lead the United States Senate not to remove the president.''
He said Clinton was willing to agree not to contest the impeachment
record established in the House and set out by Kenneth W. Starr,
the independent counsel, in order to avoid the need for witnesses.
The White House insisted that it would not adopt Starr's or the
House Republicans' interpretation of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart warned that the introduction of witnesses would
draw out the trial, ``because bringing witnesses in and not
stipulating to a record opens up a whole area of motions, discovery
and depositions. And that takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   The solemn day began just before 10 a.m., when a procession of
13 House Republicans who will act as prosecutors paraded past the
marble statuary on the second floor of the Capitol and into the
Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye!'' the Senate sergeant-at-arms,
James W. Ziglar, called out to the 100 senators and spectators in
the visitors' galleries. ``All persons are commanded to keep silent
on pain of imprisonment.'' It was a proclamation used in the trial
of Andrew Johnson _ the only other president to be judged by the
Senate _ in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, chairman of the Judiciary
Committee and leader of the House impeachment team, then stood at a
wooden lectern in the well of the chamber. The other House
Republicans lined up nearby. As the senators sat quietly, Hyde read
the two articles of impeachment that were approved by the House in
December. He accused Clinton of having ``willfully corrupted and
manipulated the judicial process of the United States for his
personal gain and exoneration.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the House members left and an extraordinary scene ensued on
the Senate floor, as about 40 senators of both parties clustered
around Lott and Daschle, talking, gesticulating, laughing and
negotiating, still trying to work out the rules for the trial. But
several senators later said that misunderstandings _ or
miscalculations _ that emerged from the discussion set the seeds
for a confrontation that almost put the Senate on a partisan course
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Senate chamber, the Capitol was under extraordinary
security. Capitol police lined the corridors and barred reporters
and visitors from much of the second floor. Black duffel bags
containing gas masks were placed at various entrances to the Senate
chamber to be used by police officers and lawmakers in the case of
a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, chemical threats are prevalent in today's
world,'' said Officer Vito Raymond of the U.S. Capitol Police.
``Preventive steps were taken by the U.S. Capitol Police.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate met again in the afternoon, with 96-year-old Sen.
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., presiding. Reading from a script, he swore
in Rehnquist, dressed in a black robe, as the presiding officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you solemnly swear that in all things pertaining to the
trial of the impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, now pending,
that you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution
and laws, so help you God?'' Thurmond asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' the chief justice answered.
</P>
<P>
   Off the floor and away from the ceremony, Republicans and
Democrats remained sharply divided over what would happen next.
With House prosecutors insistent that they want to call anywhere
from 5 to 15 witnesses, Senate Republicans prepared a plan that
would allot the House and the White House 24 hours _ spread over
about three days _ each, to present their cases beginning next
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At that point senators could submit questions to the sides. Then
the two sides would have to make a case for any witness they wanted
to call and each witness would have to be approved by a majority
vote. After hearing from any witnesses, the House and Clinton's
lawyers would have eight hours each for closing arguments. Lott
said the trial would end with a vote on the articles of impeachment
by Feb. 5 to Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's have the presentations, the opening statements, the
evidence, and the House explain why they might need this particular
witness to clarify this particular fact, or the White House, then
let the Senate consider that and vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans have expressed a desire to call such witnesses
as Monica S. Lewinsky, a prospect that some senators dread because
the testimony could dissolve into the tawdry details of her affair
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Thursday, Lott rebuffed questions about
some senators' reservations over calling witnesses like Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really would rather not start down a list of witnesses that
may or may not even be requested when the time comes,'' Lott said.
``I don't know how that witness _ what that one or any other one
would testify to. I'd want to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they were adamantly opposed to hearing from
witnesses, particularly because it is believed that the Senate will
never be able to muster the 67 votes needed to remove Clinton from
office. The Senate has 55 Republicans and 45 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be a prescription for a never-ending saga if we go to
witnesses,'' said Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt. ``The House didn't
have witnesses. They said they didn't have time because they were
in a hurry. Well, we're busy, too. I don't need a witness to tell
if this is a blue dress or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., accused the Senate Republicans of being
overly solicitous of the House Republicans. ``They're concerned
about the House,'' he said. ``The Senate's supposed to write the
rules. Henry Hyde's a fine human being, but frankly I don't give a
damn what he thinks about what our rules are going to be. He
doesn't have a vote here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats produced their own plan, a modification of an
earlier bipartisan compromise that would have ended the trial in a
week, with no witnesses and only a test vote on whether the
articles of impeachment could pass.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Democratic plan, in which the trial would begin on
Tuesday, the House and White House would each have two days to
present their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Senators would have two days to ask questions. On Jan. 21, each
side would have three hours for closing arguments and the House a
final one hour for rebuttal. The Senate would begin deliberations
on Jan. 22, conclude by Jan. 25 and vote on Jan. 26.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tempers frayed further after Lott announced, apparently after
some Democrats had concurred in the morning on the Senate floor,
that there would be a bipartisan afternoon caucus of all 100
senators in the Old Senate Chamber. But when it became clear that
the parties had no compromise, the meeting was scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans caucused separately, Thomas Griffith, the Senate
legal counsel, received a phone call from the White House counsel,
Charles F.C. Ruff, who said the White House rejected any plan to
call witnesses. That led Republicans to charge that the Democrats
were doing the bidding of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to be allowed to act as jurors?'' asked Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska. ``Or are they going to go down and ask the White
House every five minutes what they're supposed to do? We didn't do
that with Nixon, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon, with partisanship boiling over, Lott planned
for a 5 p.m. series of votes on the competing plans, which was
expected to result in trial procedures enacted by a strict
party-line vote, much like in the House.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans shied away from the partisan confrontation,
asking in a party caucus for Lott once again to request a
bipartisan caucus. ``The concern was that we didn't want to lock
people into hard positions,'' said Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, who
heads the Judiciary Committee. ``We wanted to give everyone more
time to work out an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert F. Bennett, R-Utah, said senators also were
reluctant to vote on proposals they had not had time to read or
study.
</P>
<P>
   At this point Daschle said he was learning for the first time,
in phone calls from puzzled Democrats, that he was being blamed for
blocking the bipartisan caucus. ``I was flabbergasted,'' Daschle
said. ``I didn't know about any plans for any meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said he immediately went to see Lott to clear up the
confusion, and the two leaders could be seen talking together all
alone on the Senate floor. Seeking to pull back the partisanship,
the two men then held a joint news conference where they announced
the elusive joint meeting would take place on Friday morning. But
votes on the two plans were still tentatively scheduled for later
Friday afternoon if no way is found to break the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give it another effort, another 24 hours or less to
see if we can't find a way to resolve how to proceed,'' Daschle
said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the two men pledged another good faith try at
negotiation, their differences stood in stark relief. ``Our view
probably won't change,'' Daschle said. And Lott said, ``Our
conference is hesitant to sort of preordain that there will be
witnesses or that there won't or who they might be.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Senate would vote for certain on Friday on the
competing proposals, Lott said, ``Look, at this point nothing is
for sure.'' Daschle chimed in good-humoredly, ``We can say THAT for
sure.''

COMMENTARY: MAYOR HAS CHANCE TO BE FLEXIBLE ON FIRECRACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I spend a lot of time compromising, and you just
don't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before talking about the source of that quotation, let's go to
Chinatown. Many merchants and residents there fear that a cherished
tradition, rooted in a culture dating back thousands of years, is
about to be outlawed once again by City Hall fiat.
</P>
<P>
   This is a centuries-old custom of setting off firecrackers to
celebrate the Chinese New Year, which will begin on Feb. 16. On the
Chinese lunar calendar, with its repeating cycle of 12 animals, it
will be the Year of the Rabbit _ a sweet year, you might say,
because those born in it are said to be affectionate and tranquil.
</P>
<P>
   In Chinatown, the new year was ushered in for decades with lion
dancers wending their way through the neighborhood while red
firecrackers popped away and heightened the excitement.
</P>
<P>
   This was not noise for noise's sake, an Asian-American version
of the familiar yahoo approach to the Fourth of July. For the
Chinese, red is a symbol of good fortune. The firecrackers
themselves have spiritual meaning. Their noise scares off evil
spirits, and their smoke carries away bad spirits that may linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without any firecrackers, it is no celebration at all,'' said
Paul Lee, whose family has owned General Store on Mott Street since
1891. This view was echoed by another Mott Street businessman, Jan
Lee (no relation, as they say). Jan Lee is also a director of a
lion-dance troupe called the Chinatown Community Young Lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole celebration of the lion dance is tied to the
firecrackers,'' he said. ``The lion dance without firecrackers is
like the St. Patrick's Day parade without bagpipes or marching
bands.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for the last two years, Chinatown has been silenced on its
big day because Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has preferred to ban the
firecrackers as a supposed menace to public safety. Last year's
holiday was the dreariest in memory, local residents said. Streets
were largely empty, and many stores did not bother to open.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that City Hall could not say what serious injuries in
Chinatown had been suffered in the past. Never mind that organizers
of the celebration had arranged last year for an amply controlled
pyrotechnics display, with barricades to keep crowds back and with
an ambulance and a fire truck on hand just in case something went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said no, and that was that.
</P>
<P>
   Don't mention tradition, he said. His exact words were ``Before
we do this, like, cultural thing, we have to sort of, like, get
real here.'' The authorities in Beijing, too, had clamped down on
fireworks, he noted, apparently taking comfort in the fact that his
policy matched that of the communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   No question, Giuliani has supporters in Chinatown, businessmen
like Ronald Liong, a pharmacist on Mott Street. ``I prefer the
ban,'' Liong said. ``I think fireworks are hazardous. But actually,
one way or another, it doesn't matter to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It does matter, though, to many of his neighbors. Some feel
demeaned by the mayor's downplaying of the cultural issue. Others
are still offended by a City Hall spokeswoman who waved off the
pro-fireworks forces last year as people who ``condone a dangerous
lifestyle,'' as if they were dope peddlers or gun runners.
</P>
<P>
   But a new year brings a new chance to work something out, said
Robin Mui, vice chairman of the Asian-American Education and
Heritage Foundation. Although Mui was not overly hopeful about
mayoral flexibility, he pointed out that City Hall's opposition to
fireworks was not absolute. Somehow, Macy's is allowed to blast
away along the East River on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if a corporation can have a pyrotechnics display, why
not a community?'' Mui said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Police Commissioner Marilyn Mode said discussions with
civic leaders in Chinatown began last month. But no one doubts that
ultimately it is up to Giuliani to decide whether there is a way to
satisfy all parties. ``The man is The Man,'' Mui said. ``We're
doing it his way now.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the unattributed quotation at the top of
the column. The person who said he spends a lot of time
compromising was none other than the mayor himself, in an interview
with City Hall reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Lee said he was curious to see in the weeks before the New
Year if that spirit of compromise could extend to Chinatown and its
customs.

HEALTH CARE AIDE PLEADS GUILTY IN PLOT TO KIDNAP ILL BROOKLYN BOY
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN: S.C., Va.) 
 (DW) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A woman who kidnapped a Brooklyn boy with cerebral
palsy because, her lawyer said, she believed he needed more
attention than his parents were giving him, pleaded guilty Thursday
to a federal charge of kidnapping conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the woman, Theresa Gaetonina Goldberg, entered her
plea in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, her husband, David
Goldberg, pleaded guilty in the same court to a charge of
intentionally concealing the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Goldberg, a onetime health aide in the child's Williamsburg
home, faces up to six years in prison, and her husband could
receive up to 21 months. The two had been charged with kidnapping
and conspiracy in the case, in which Mrs. Goldberg took the boy,
Chaim Weill, then 6, from his home in October.
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators, she had planned to move with the
child to South Carolina. But the police found the two at a Virginia
motel two days after she abducted him. The child no longer had a
yarmulke or payess, the side curls he had worn as a Hasidic Jew.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the abduction, law enforcement officials
speculated that the Goldbergs, who are Jehovah's Witnesses, might
have been motivated by a desire to seek nonmedical, perhaps
spiritual, treatment for the boy, who can communicate only through
nods and facial expressions.
</P>
<P>
   In court, neither Mrs. Goldberg, 40, nor Goldberg, 47, gave any
reasons for their actions, but their lawyers said that seeking
alternate treatment for the child was not their motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a child who needed attention on a 24-hour basis,''
Mrs. Goldberg's lawyer, Jerome Karp, said as his client, who had
entered her plea in a soft voice, stood by. ``There are four
children in the family, and the mother and father could not give
the type of attention this child needs, and she felt she could
fulfill that.''
</P>
<P>
   But a friend of the Weill family, Rabbi Leib Glanz, a leader of
Williamsburg's Hasidic community, said that any implication that
Chaim was neglected by his parents was ``total nonsense.'' The boy,
he said, was cared for at home ``100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Goldberg, who is free on a $200,000 bond, and Goldberg,
free on a $50,000 bond, are to be sentenced March 23 by Judge I.
Leo Glasser. Speaking of Goldberg's crime of concealment, his
lawyer, Steven Mandel, said, ``Theresa loved the child, and David
was guilty of loving Theresa.''
</P>
<P>
   According to papers filed by the U. S. Attorney's office in
Brooklyn, Goldberg, an employee in the mail room of a law firm,
ultimately told investigators that when his wife had first informed
him, about six months before the abduction, that she planned to
kidnap the boy, he opposed the idea, and she did not pursue it
then. But when she raised the idea again three months later, he
agreed that ``the child needed a better place to live,'' the papers
quote him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg's plea to criminal concealment means that he faces a
lesser sentence than if he was convicted of the original kidnapping
or conspiracy charges. Mrs. Goldberg _ though she pleaded to the
original conspiracy charge in the case _ hopes that she will be
treated leniently because she admitted her crime, Karp said.

STATUS AS BIG UNDERDOG DOESN'T FAZE CARDINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Let's see, now . . . The Arizona Cardinals have
not won a playoff game in ``six days.'' The last time they were
successful in postseason competition, Bill Clinton was president.
</P>
<P>
   There's little to no reason, then, to believe that they can stay
on the field Sunday when they visit the mighty Minnesota Vikings
(15-1) for a playoff rumble, according to the experts. So
unimpressed with the Cardinals and their playoff drought _ which
covers non-strike days only _ are the oddsmakers that they've
installed this hapless group as a 14{-point underdog against the
team with the best record in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   It's just too easy to diss the Cardinals, who've become a
national Cinderella story and made believers of doubters, until
it's time to back it with cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes being a big underdog has it's advantages,''
Cardinals safety Tommy Bennett said. ``No one thinks we can win.
This team has done lots of things no one believed it could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Against all odds seems to be the essence of the Cardinals'
season.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely is a team a double-digit underdog in a second-round
playoff game. Add to it that Minnesota is only the third team in
NFL history to post a 15-1 record. The other two _ the 1984 San
Francisco 49ers and the 1985 Chicago Bears _ won the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure seemingly is on Coach Vince Tobin and the
Cardinals. Until one considers that Tobin was involved in a
second-round game only three years ago in which his team, the
Indianapolis Colts, was a double-digit underdog going to Arrowhead
Stadium to face the Kansas City Chiefs. Tobin, then defensive
coordinator of the Colts, primed his unit to hold the Chiefs to one
touchdown. Indianapolis pulled a 10-7 upset.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs, however, did not post the highest-scoring season in
the NFL history, as the Vikings did with their 556 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything else is almost exactly the same,'' Tobin said.
``The Chiefs had the best record in the league (13-3), they were
prohibitive favorites, we were playing at Arrowhead, which is noted
for its noise. We went down there and played a great football game
and won.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being big underdogs really wasn't a factor. We'd struggled to
get to the playoffs that year, and Indianapolis had not been there
for long time. I do know that once you start winning, you start
thinking you're pretty good, and once you think you're pretty good,
then you become pretty good. That's where we were then, and that's
where we are now. We're going to go play a game and expect to win
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have been off for a week, earning the opening-round
bye with their record. They haven't really had a clinker this
season.
</P>
<P>
   They've had them in past playoffs, though.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals backup receiver Ronnie Anderson, formerly of the Green
Bay Packers, knows that this is the third NFC Central title the
Vikings have won under Coach Dennis Green, but their playoff record
under Green is 1-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've choked up in the past in the playoffs,'' Anderson
said. ``The pressure is on them. At the same time, we're
Cinderella. If you don't pay attention to Cinderella . . . That was
Dallas' problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had grown accustomed to being kicked in the teeth.
But considering that they posted their first winning record since
1984, got to the playoffs for the first time since 1975, and won a
postseason game for the first time since 1947, thoroughly
dominating the Dallas Cowboys at Texas Stadium Saturday, many
players are taken aback that few give them much hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think we're going to go in there intimidated, I don't think
our team is intimidated at all,'' Tobin said. ``We're one of eight
teams left. We have as good a chance as they do.''
</P>
<P>
   It took botched pass coverage by the Cardinals' defense and a
Vikings field goal with 10 seconds left for the Vikings to win,
20-19, when the teams met last season in Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know from last year that we can beat them,'' said Lomas
Brown, the Cardinals' seven-time Pro Bowl left tackle and an
offensive co-captain. ``If we do what we can, what we've done the
last couple of weeks, we will beat them. They've had a great year.
The thing we have to do is not be in awe of that, play them a tough
60 minutes, keep the game close, and in end we'll have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've played from the lead in almost every game. To be
honest, if they were to get taken out of their element and have to
play from behind, you might have a different team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake Plummer, the second-year quarterback who has directed nine
fourth-quarter comebacks in his 27 pro games _ including an
NFL-record seven wins by three points or fewer this season _ said
he doesn't care if the oddsmakers install the Cardinals as 49-point
underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't think our team cares, either,'' Plummer said.
``Anybody who follows the game, no matter the spread, knows that
who plays the best that day will win. It's not like because we're
the underdog we're going to go practice harder. It's that it is a
do-or-die game.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this enthusiasm from a youthful team is laughable in the
eyes of Vikings receiver Randy Moss, a grizzled veteran of 16
professional games. He has snickered at the Cardinals secondary _
except for five-time Pro Bowler Aeneas Williams _ and suggested
that Arizona comes in with nothing more than a pipe dream.
</P>
<P>
   Others among the Vikings aren't sure that Moss is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a two-touchdown favorite, that's what everybody expects,
and that's fine,'' Vikings running back Leroy Hoard said. ``We
haven't set a goal for ourselves that we haven't reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock, whose team's fortunes
could hinge on the manner in which he covers Rob Moore and Frank
Sanders, said there are great expectations.
</P>

   ``We're 15-1. We lit the world up on national television, had
great games where people have seen us play,'' Hitchcock said.
``Everybody expects us to be the best.''
</P>
<P>
   But Green plays down any notion that his squad will plunder the
visitors like a ship full of Vikings gone berserk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the same people that say we're favorites were the same
people that picked us fourth in the NFC Central Division,'' Green
said. ``It was only five months ago that they said Green Bay would
win it, Tampa Bay would be second, Detroit third, and Minnesota
fourth. We saw ourselves as the Central Division champion then and
we see ourselves as that now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good football team, Arizona. They do a lot of
things well. So you don't have to be concerned with what the
experts say, because the experts didn't have Arizona or us making
the playoffs. We don't want to give the experts too much credit.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems few want to give the new and improved Cardinals much
credit yet, either. &QL;

N.J. MOVES TO CUT ELECTRIC RATES AND DEREGULATE ENERGY MARKET
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman and legislative leaders
reached agreement Thursday on a plan to cut commercial and
residential electricity rates by 10 percent over the next three
years and deregulate the state's energy market.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which cleared two critical committees Thursday and is
expected to win passage by the Legislature next week, would
dissolve the monopolies that have controlled New Jersey's $10
billion electricity and natural gas markets for decades, end the
state's policy of setting utility rates and allow consumers to
choose between competing suppliers _ the way they now choose
long-distance telephone carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But some important aspects remain to be worked out, and it is
far from certain that the initiative will foster vigorous
competition or produce long-term savings to New Jersey consumers.
</P>
<P>
   State officials formulated the plan because many business owners
complained that New Jersey's energy rates, now 50 percent higher
than the national average, were hampering attempts to lure new
industries and create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, which is expected to go into effect in August,
homeowners can expect to see an immediate 5 percent reduction in
their monthly electric bills and an additional 5 percent drop to be
phased in during the following two years. The average residential
customer spends $852 a year on electricity.
</P>
<P>
   After the fourth year, market forces will set the rates, and it
is possible that those forces will allow rates to rise rather than
fall. New Jersey residents will also be able to choose between
competing natural gas companies beginning in December.

CARDINALS CAN'T WIN _ CAN THEY?

   TEMPE, Ariz. - Ball cap on backward, pen and paper in hand, Jake
Plummer took his teammates' orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lomas, whattaya want?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Double burger,'' Lomas Brown sang out.
</P>
<P>
   Jake scribbled down Brown's lunch order. He took Rob Moore's.
Then he looked around the locker room and asked the question you
expect from a teenager working the drive-through window for the
minimum wage but not from a $29 million NFL quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want fries with that?''
</P>
<P>
   The kid who sped off to Wendy's is the most popular athlete in
Arizona. As an Arizona State senior, he led the Sun Devils to an
upset victory over Nebraska and an 11-0 record. In his second NFL
season, he took his team, a perennial loser, to the playoffs. Now,
lo and behold, after beating Dallas on the road, the Wild Cards are
two games away from the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But this has to end.
</P>
<P>
   The Cards can't beat the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Can they?
</P>
<P>
   As Brown sat at his corner locker, he was asked how Sunday's
game would rank as an upset. On paper, this is a mismatch. The
Cardinals are 14{-point underdogs. What would you compare this
with, Lomas? The boy and his slingshot vs. the giant?
</P>
<P>
   Buster Douglas against Mike Tyson?
</P>
<P>
   ``Noooo,'' Brown said, making a face.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, yeah. Buster Douglas,'' the Cardinals left tackle said on
second thought. The 14-year veteran who blocks for the kid who had
left to pick up lunch smiled his accommodating smile, a beaming
smile that TV cameras love. ``Sure, we'll be Buster,'' Lomas said.
``But not as fat.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 in a dome in Tokyo, Douglas knocked out Tyson in one of
boxing's greatest upsets. But the Cards can't KO the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Can they?
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota Vikings finished 15-1. They scored 41 points
against Washington, 46 against Dallas, 48 against Chicago, 50
against Jacksonville. They broke the NFL season record this year by
scoring 556 points _ 231 more than the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Why are they so good?
</P>
<P>
   Dave McGinnis had to laugh. ``Players,'' he said, and ticked off
the big-play stars. Quarterback Randall Cunningham, the NFL's
top-rated passer. Three of the top 10 receivers in the league _
Cris Carter, Jake Reed, Randy Moss. All Moss did his rookie season
was catch 17 touchdown passes and make the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's offensive line is as good as any in the NFL. The
Vikings allowed only 25 sacks, half as many as the Cardinals.
Robert Smith can turn the corner, hit the hole. He rolled up more
rushing yards than any Cardinals running back, including Adrian
Murrell.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Anderson is the best place-kicker in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Dave, here's a defensive scheme for you. A 5-3-5 formation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm, that's 13,'' McGinnis said. He stroked his chin and
smiled. ``Gimme 14 and we'll blanket the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota has won 13 of its past 15 home games. The Metrodome
can become so loud that opposing quarterbacks can't make themselves
heard over the roar. The Cardinals' offense has practiced using a
``silent count.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Vince Tobin tell his team? It isn't the size of the
dog in the fight, but the size of the fight in the dog? Kites rise
highest against the wind?
</P>
<P>
   During his brief career as coach of the Houston Oilers, the late
Bill Peterson once gathered his team around him and told the story
of David and Goliath. Coach Pete, who had terrible trouble with
names, called David ``Davis,'' and his version would have
confounded Old Testament scholars, especially the part about how
Davis practiced his aim by firing stones from his slingshot at
empty beer cans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite tears of laughter, his team got the point.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Tobin is a realist. He knows what he has and what the
Vikings have. He knows what others are saying, thinking. ``I'm
sure,'' he said Thursday, ``the Vikings aren't that concerned about
the Cardinals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wild Cards can't win.
</P>
<P>
   Can they?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not. But whoever thought they still would be playing and
Jake Plummer would be picking up a sack of burgers for his
teammates and talking about going to Minnesota and playing against
Randall Cunningham, whose poster Jake once had hanging on his
bedroom wall? &QL;

STARR INDICTS FRIEND OF KATHLEEN WILLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has brought a
four-count indictment against Julie Hiatt Steele, a Richmond, Va.,
woman who cast doubt on accusations by Kathleen Willey that
President Clinton had made an unwelcome sexual pass at Ms. Willey.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Virginia, which
has been hearing evidence of possible witness tampering involving
Ms. Willey, charged Ms. Steele with three counts of obstructing
justice and one count of making false statements.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charged Ms. Steele, who was once a close friend
of Ms. Willey, with filing a false affidavit in the Paula Jones
sexual misconduct lawsuit against Clinton. In that affidavit, Ms.
Steele denied that Ms. Willey had ever told her that the president
had made a sexual advance to her in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele, 52, is a peripheral figure in the Starr
investigation, but her disavowal of Ms. Willey's account was an
impediment to making the Willey matter part of the independent
counsel's impeachment referral to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition in the Jones case and in his grand jury
testimony, the president denied making a sexual advance to Ms.
Willey, who was once a volunteer in the Clinton White House. Ms.
Willey said the president made the aggressive and unwelcome pass at
her in the White House in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Luque, Ms. Steele's lawyer, denounced the content and the
timing of the indictment, which came on the opening day of
Clinton's impeachment trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a glaring example of Starr's gross abuse of his
prosecutorial power,'' Ms. Luque said. ``Ms. Steele has told the
truth and is innocent. Starr has clearly timed this baseless
accusation in a transparent attempt to unfairly influence the
pending impeachment proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Luque added that ``the indictment is a back-door attempt to
put Kathleen Willey's immunized claims before the public, something
Starr was afraid to do in his referral to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly III, a spokesman for the office of the
independent counsel, dismissed Ms. Luque's claims. ``That is
absolutely false,'' Bakaly said. ``We deny any relationship. We
bring cases when the cases are ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Willey matter was not part of the impeachment
referral to Congress, Starr, at the request of the House Judiciary
Committee, sent supplemental investigative materials relating to
the Willey investigation to the House. Some House members reviewed
this material before they cast their votes on the articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Luque has complained to the Justice Department that Ms.
Steele was being unfairly treated by Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Willey matter is somewhat tangential to Starr's
investigation of Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky, Ms. Steele
was twice called before the grand jury. Her daughter and brother
were also questioned before the grand jury, as were her former
lawyer and accountant.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele, a single mother of an adopted child, has said
Starr's investigators also raised questions about the legality of
her child's adoption. But Starr has denied that such activity
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele said last year that Ms. Willey had pressed her to
confirm her story to Michael Isikoff, a Newsweek reporter who was
looking into the Willey matter in 1997. As a favor to her friend,
Ms. Steele said she did initially tell Isikoff that Ms. Willey had
told her that the president groped her, but Ms. Steele later
recanted.
</P>
<P>
   Isikoff reported Ms. Steele's differing accounts in a Newsweek
article about Ms. Willey that was published in August 1997. Ms.
Steele later sued Isikoff and Newsweek for breach of contract, a
lawsuit the magazine contends is unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   In the indictment, the grand jury decided that it was Ms.
Steele, not Ms. Willey, who lied. The indictment cites two friends
of Ms. Steele, listed as John Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 1, who
said Ms. Steele had told them that Clinton had made sexual advances
toward Ms. Willey.
</P>
<P>
   All four counts in the indictment relate to Ms. Steele's denial
that Ms. Willey told her about being groped by the president. After
the Newsweek article was published, Ms. Steele was contacted by
Clinton's lawyers in the Jones case, and she agreed to file an
affidavit casting doubt on Ms. Willey's credibility. In the
affidavit, Ms. Steele said Ms. Willey had never told her about the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   But the grand jury indictment accuses Ms. Steele of obstructing
justice, asserting that her affidavit was false.
</P>
<P>
   ``In truth and in fact,'' the indictment states, ``as defendant
Steele well knew and believed, Kathleen Willey told defendant
Steele about the alleged sexual advances and defendant Steele even
related information about Ms. Willey's account of the incident to
several of defendant Steele's friends.'' .
</P>
<P>
   The other three counts of the indictment cite instances in which
Ms. Steele denied Ms. Willey's account, with the grand jury
deciding that those were acts of obstructing justice and lying,
including her appearance on ``Larry King Live,'' the CNN program.
The indictment also accuses Ms. Steele of obstructing justice by
making false statements to the grand jury and trying to influence
the testimony of other witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The false-statements count relates to assertions that Ms. Steele
made to agents of the FBI in which she said Ms. Willey had not
confided in her about the encounter with Clinton, and told them her
Jones affidavit was truthful.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury is continuing to investigate other witnesses to
determine whether there were efforts to intimidate Ms. Willey and
influence her testimony in the Jones case.

VIKINGS WEREN'T GAMBLING WHEN THEY PICKED MOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. - Hey, Randy, got a minute?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' he says, bounding off an exercise machine, ducking
into a back room, avoiding the small media contingent milling about
an empty locker room.
</P>
<P>
   So resumes the story of Randy Moss, the gift bestowed on the
Minnesota Vikings, a lightning bolt that has struck the league, the
real Most Valuable Player of football, living proof that there
aren't enough black men in the front offices across the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Where does it begin? In a bowling alley, on a night when he
responded to racial taunts in a way not uncommon to most Black kids
with any shred of dignity? In Bobby Bowden's office at Florida
State, the day he was released for having marijuana-laced urine,
the day he cried for another chance? The two years at Marshall
where he caught 53 touchdown passes and was arrested, along with
his girlfriend, for a hazy, overblown domestic incident? Or the day
he wore wraparound sunglasses inside the Downtown Athletic Club,
shocking the old guard who treat the Heisman Trophy like a chalice
from heaven?
</P>
<P>
   No, it began on draft day. When a team with a Black coach
realized something that 19 other teams did not. That reputation
exceeded the reality. That circumstances differ when you grow up in
a West Virginia town where White classmates openly scribble their
hatred for your kind on desks and walls. That apologies and
repentance go unheeded if you're not listening. That Randy Moss
simply wouldn't fit in the box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know one thing,'' Vikings receivers coach Hubbard Alexander
said. ``Dennis Green understood and knew what was going on. That
stuff with Randy happened three years ago, when he was a kid.
There's no way you can hold that against him. Not in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   So here he is, age 21, blowing up, reinventing his position,
possessing an autograph that ranks only below Dan Marino, John
Elway and Brett Favre in value. A rookie who will start in the Pro
Bowl and vowed revenge on all the teams that passed him up,
understandably leery of all the sudden love.
</P>
<P>
   So he's prone to throw an occasional cold shoulder to the
pen-and-microphone crowd. You know what? You still can't cover him
on a deep route. &QL; 
The next Michael Jordan? &QL; 
``Do you understand this kid could be Michael Jordan?'' teammate
Cris Carter said. ``That we're on the ground floor of something
huge?''
</P>
<P>
   As the Cardinals prepare their slingshots for the Vikings, the
matter of containing Moss is no easy matter. And he knows it. If
you were 6 feet 4 with a 41-inch vertical leap, with 4.3 speed in
the 40-yard dash and the ability to extend your hands at the last
second possible, you would, too.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, in December: ``I want to do whatever I can to rip this
league up.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss, earlier in the week: ``When they come out and play, you're
going to see something you've never seen before. I plan on having
my playoffs be better than my regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss, on Tuesday: ``With our mind-set, I think we're going out
there to destroy anybody in front of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss, addressing the Cardinals' secondary on Wednesday: ``They
are average corners, with the exception of Aeneas Williams.'' &QL; 
Lack of humility justified &QL; 
Humility is a wonderful thing, and while definitely missing here,
it is worth noting that Moss has never ``not'' been great at an
athletic endeavor. Twice, he was West Virginia's Mr. Basketball. He
attracted professional baseball scouts with his prowess in center
field. He won a state track title without training. Bulls General
Manager Jerry Krause says he could've played in the NBA. He has
torn through NFL defenses without studying film.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, they knew from the first day of practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, when you throw a take-off route, you throw it right
at 40 yards,'' Vikings quarterback Brad Johnson said. ``That's kind
of the way it works with everyone who plays in this league. With
him, you can't really time him out. You just drop back and throw it
as far and as high as you can and let him go get it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there's this little game they play in practice. A
quarterback takes a five-step drop and throws the ball as far as he
can. To this day, a football has yet to land in front of Moss.
</P>
<P>
   There are other stories, too. Like how he glances at the giant
television monitors during his routes, and when he sees Randall
Cunningham's arm cocking backward, he knows the ball is coming. Or
how he told Johnson that if an opposing corner seemed to have him
covered, don't worry, he's only toying with them.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, real ammunition for the real MVP: 17 touchdowns. Ten
of which covered 40-plus yards, tying a 1951 record set by ``Crazy
Legs'' Hirsch. Thirteen catches, 343 yards and three touchdowns
against Green Bay, not including receptions of 61 and 75 yards
nullified by penalty.
</P>
<P>
   `The missing link' &QL; 
No one man has lifted his team to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was definitely the missing link to this offense,''
Cunningham said.
</P>
<P>
   There is some irony, too. Take away the Chargers, Colts and
Cardinals, and there are 16 teams that passed him up, including the
Bengals, who did so twice. If the Cowboys weren't in clean-up mode,
they would've taken Moss, and maybe they're 15-1. If Bowden had
another chance to give, Moss might've been on the field at the
Fiesta Bowl opposite Peter Warrick, and Florida State is national
champion.
</P>
<P>
   And just so you know: Moss wears sneakers and jeans, drives an
Isuzu Trooper. He shares a townhouse with his brother, Eric. He
doesn't go out at night. He has his own charity foundation, Randy's
Purple Pioneers. And that shoving match with his girlfriend from
West Virginia, the one that got him arrested for the last time?
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Libby Offutt, former Hooters waitress, mother of his
two children, a woman who still commutes from West Virginia to Eden
Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be a saint, but he's not torturing kittens, either. A
victim of his own perception until Green _ himself a product of the
inner-city _ interviewed Moss and recognized the story. That Randy
Moss didn't fit the label.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we drafted him, I was doing back flips,'' said Alexander,
who also coached Michael Irvin in Dallas. ``And he hasn't
disappointed anybody. In fact, he's better than anyone thought. Who
could've dreamed that a guy of his caliber could've slipped so
far?''

BASKETBALL COLUMN: IN FINAL STAREDOWN, PLAYERS TAKE THE HIT
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perhaps the best development for the union in the
settlement of the National Basketball Association labor dispute is
that the players and their negotiators won't have to go through the
process again for six or seven years. These basketball guys haven't
got it right yet.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1995 lockout, a large segment of the membership
decided the smartest strategy would be to decertify the union, thus
rendering the league's lockout illegal. But the union was severely
split _ the union chief was opposed _ and the effort failed.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter memories of the decertification movement were
probably still too fresh for the new chief, Billy Hunter, to
undertake again. But the prevailing view among some sports labor
people Thursday was that that was the way to challenge this latest
David Stern lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Said one lawyer with vast sports labor experience: ``The
strategy was as soon as the lockout was declared, decertify and
say, `OK, Stern, you have an illegal lockout.'''
</P>
<P>
   Under labor law, the lawyer explained, if there is no union left
to lock out, the league's action becomes a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League union decertified with raging
success earlier in this decade. The move enabled the union to sue
the league over free agency, and the union's victory paved the way
for a new labor agreement and peace that had eluded the league.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the baseball union fought hard to persuade
Congress to exclude labor relations from Major League Baseball's
antitrust exemption. In fact, in their contentious dispute with the
owners in the mid-1990s, the players won the cooperation of the
owners in lobbying for the antitrust bill.
</P>
<P>
   The union had long felt that it was at a disadvantage because
the owners' antitrust exemption prevented the players from suing on
antitrust grounds. Now that the exemption has been diluted, the
players could use the decertification strategy to challenge the
owners in court.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter, the basketball players' leader, eschewed that idea,
even though Gene Upshaw, the football union head, had encouraged
him to follow the decertification route. Hunter adopted a different
strategy. Although the players had never been tested, he decided
they would tough it out, sticking together until they wore down the
league or forced the league into a compromise agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with that strategy,'' said one labor lawyer, ``is
you have to rely on the players holding firm down to the bitter
end. It's one thing if it's the baseball players. Marvin Miller and
Don Fehr had them trained for 25 years. Unless the players are
trained for a long period of time like that, you have to have a
different strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   A different strategy certainly was needed against the imperious
chief of the NBA strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't fight Stern in a fair fight because it's not a fair
fight,'' the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball players did a good job for nearly six months, but
as the sixth month approached the seventh, more and more players
became fidgety, apparently starting to believe Stern's threats to
cancel the season and start next season with replacement players.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of continuing to hold out, as the baseball players did
in 1994-95 until they agreed to a meaningless luxury tax, the
basketball players crumbled and implored Hunter to make a deal, any
deal, to salvage some money-making part of the season.
</P>
<P>
   So for the first time in major professional sports history,
players have accepted limits on individual salaries. First came the
payroll caps, usually mischaracterized as salary caps; now comes
the real salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on an NBA player's service time, his salary in a
one-year deal or in the first year of a multiyear contract is
limited to a set figure _ $9 million, $11 million or $14 million.
If it is a multiyear contract, the player's salary can rise by 10
percent each year. That means a 10-year player could sign a
five-year contract for $85.5 million, still not a bad payday but
artificially controlled nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, leave it to the teams' salary strategists to
come up with ways to beat the system. They always do. The fun part
of recent sports labor negotiations has been that the owners insist
they have to have caps, and when they get them, they compete to see
who can be first to circumvent the cap.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is supposed to have the one hard payroll cap in the
sports world. Players are supposed to get 63 percent of designated
revenues. But with the signing-bonus system teams have used, the
actual share has averaged 70 percent. That's not too hard for the
players to take.
</P>
<P>
   Could the newest salary cap find a home in other sports in
future negotiations? ``I don't think this will have tremendous
effects elsewhere,'' said one labor lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The next baseball negotiation could be the first testing ground
for it, if it works for the owners in the NBA. But that is a few
years off, so the baseball owners don't have to worry yet about
what the union's reaction would be.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they already know the answer: no.

CARDS' OFFENSE ON RIGHT TRACK  
 TRESTMAN ENGINEERS BIG TURNAROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Marc Trestman did not have a particularly tough
act to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone would have looked good as offensive coordinator of the
Cardinals compared to what they'd had.
</P>
<P>
   But Trestman has looked really good, a gift that floated to the
team in much the same way Jim Fassel did during his season as
offensive coordinator in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are in the second round of the playoffs Sunday
against the Minnesota Vikings because Trestman's offense made a
late-season turnaround to help cover for an injury-battered
defense.
</P>
<P>
   About this time last year, the Cardinals were looking for an
offensive coordinator. Dick Jamieson had been canned after one
miserable season in which his unit rushed for a league-low 78 yards
a game, gave up a league-high 78 sacks and averaged only 17.7
points. Players complained.
</P>
<P>
   Trestman came in with a good pedigree off the ``West Coast
offense'' family tree of the San Francisco 49ers. He had been
tutored by Bill Walsh and George Seifert while with the 49ers after
serving an apprenticeship under Bud Grant and Jerry Burns with the
Vikings. Trestman, 42, grew up in the Twin Cities.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement in the Cardinals' attack this season was as
subtle as Larry Centers plowing over a safety after catching a
swing pass. The Cardinals rushed for just under 102 yards a game, a
31 percent improvement. They gave up 50 sacks, a 36 percent
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   But they averaged just 20.3 points, only a field goal a game
better than last season. That's largely a byproduct of Trestman
learning how best to use his new toys. It's an area that Trestman
knows has to improve on Sunday, when the Cardinals visit the
Vikings in the second round of the NFL Playoffs. The Vikings set a
league scoring record. The Cardinals will be challenged to keep
pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not at the standard, the expectation level, that I
think we can perform at over a 16-week season,'' Trestman said.
``We are not scoring as much as I believe we should. We are not
making as many plays overall as we would like. We are making
progress. We are going in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottom line, I don't think we're even close to playing as
efficiently or as dynamically as I think we're capable of playing.
Over time we will. This is a growing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Trestman's pride and joy is the development of second-year
quarterback Jake Plummer, who suddenly has become a national story
with his ability to bring the team back for last-second wins.
</P>
<P>
   The development of a young offensive line that many analysts
earlier described as the worst in the league is a close second
under new line coach George Warhop. With three first-year starters,
it has become respectable.
</P>
<P>
   New running back Adrian Murrell rushed for more than 1,000
yards, or about what the team's top four rushers combined gained in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Moore, a 1997 Pro Bowler, and Frank Sanders, the NFC
receiving leader this season, became one of the league's most
effective receiving tandems.
</P>
<P>
   They're all flourishing within a system that is in its infancy.
Since the bye in Week 8, the unit has been capable of controlling
the ball, critical after injuries took a toll on the defense.
</P>
<P>
   To become a Super Bowl threat, Trestman's offense has to score
more than 20 points a game, though. Making the most efficient use
of total yardage and field position will be the next step in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the break, I noticed a big difference in Jake and in the
way our offense performed,'' Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin said.
``They had an extra week to go back and kind of retool everything,
concentrating on what we did best and not worrying so much about
what the defenses were doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refining process is more condensing what you do than
expanding when you've got a young football team. You want to make
sure your quarterback knows perfectly what everybody does on every
play so he's comfortable with what he sees. If it's not there, he
knows where else to go with ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marc helped him a lot in that regard. Any time you've got a
new offensive coordinator, he's got to learn his team. He really
didn't know Jake, and Jake didn't know him. It was a learning
process. We tried to keep as much as we could, so it was not a
totally new learning experience for the players. But you still want
to let your offensive coordinator take the team in the direction he
is most comfortable with. He calls the plays, he is responsible for
getting the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The coordinator-quarterback relationship is the heart of the
system Trestman is building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake has unlimited potential,'' Trestman said. ``He and we
have expectations of playing at a real high level week to week, but
he's still 24 years old, in the second year of his career and his
first year of a new offense. When it will happen, I don't know. He
has some growing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never measured quarterbacks by anything other than their
ability to win, and Jake is an example of what that's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, it was a rough go. There were critics who said
Trestman's offense wasn't any better than Jamieson's when the
Cardinals stumbled through their first seven games. Some went as
far as to suggest that Plummer should be benched because he was
making killing turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put in a new offense, you definitely take steps
backward before you go forward,'' Trestman said. ``I stayed the
course and we talked about that early in the year. We had to bite
the bullet and take our hits in terms of the growing process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really we're running the same plays we put in during training
camp. There has not been a humongous change in anything we have
done. I told the guys that `this is a system we have. We are not
experimenting with it. I know it works.' I think it's the
repetitions with it, the redundancy of doing it over and over
against different looks, different personnel that has enabled us to
get better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of the running game with Murrell also was an
enabler. It is the threat of the run, more than the run itself,
that is essential. Finding a group of plays to make the best use of
the line's blocking skills and Murrell's cutback style created the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it can't be denied that we have a 1,000-yard rusher
and Adrian was hurt a couple of games,'' Trestman said. ``My goal
was to get 1,250 or 1,300 yards from him. We always say we don't
care how the 125 come, but if we get 125 rushing yards each game
we'll be in pretty good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   By Cardinals standards, it has been a banner year for the
offense, with clear improvement. By the standards that Trestman was
judged by while with the 49ers, the unit is just scratching the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the season is over, whenever, we're going to be happy
with a lot of things that we got done,'' Trestman said. ``I'm proud
of our guys. I love the chemistry and character of our players. I
think they've bought into it and given it everything they have.
It's a wonderful experience to coach these guys through the growth
process we are in. But we're not where we want to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going in the right direction. We are still in the very
young stages of this offense. We're 17 games into a new offense.
Brian Billick (offensive coordinator of the Vikings) is six years
into a new offense. The Vikings are the standard right now. That's
where we want to get to.'' &QL;

VIKES' RECEIVERS TOPS, CARDS CATCHING UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Cardinals offensive coordinator Marc Trestman
calls them the best receiving trio in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Cris Carter, who has been to six consecutive Pro Bowls at
Minnesota, is headed to the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Moss, a Pro Bowl starter as a rookie, has been compared to
Michael Jordan by one NFL coach and Willie Mays by another.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there's Jake Reed, who had four consecutive 1,000-yard
seasons until suffering a back injury this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no trio like them and probably never has been,''
Trestman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have two of the NFL's best in Frank Sanders and
Rob Moore, both of whom often get overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, the NFC's reception leader this season, and Moore, the
league's receiving yards leader a year ago, aren't jealous of the
Minnesota receivers' recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see those guys on TV all the time, and when you're
15-1, you have a lot of things going for you,'' Moore said. ``When
you've got two guys in the Pro Bowl, it's quite natural they get
all the ink.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, that we've finally started winning, we're getting
attention. It will come.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals meet the Vikings in an NFC second-round playoff
game Sunday in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Carter and Reed entered this season as the only receiving tandem
in league history to each get more than 1,000 yards the previous
four seasons. Then, the Vikings drafted Moss in the first round
last April after 20 other teams passed on him because of his
off-the-field problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best receiver I'd ever seen on tape coming out of
college,'' Trestman said. ``Vic (Cardinals wide receivers coach Vic
Rapp) said he thought (Moss) was the best football player he'd ever
seen coming out of college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget what I said about him at a staff meeting
last spring. I said, `This is the Michael Jordan of the draft.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Moss, 6 feet 4, 211 pounds, had Jordan-like numbers in his first
year. He set or tied 28 team records and set or tied three league
marks in catching 69 passes for 1,313 yards and an NFL-high 17
scores.
</P>
<P>
   He has 10 touchdowns of 40 or more yards.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Horton, the former Tampa Bay and Cleveland scout, said
Vikings Coach Dennis Green compares Moss to Hall of Fame center
fielder Willie Mays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember how Willie Mays used to sit out in center field and
at the last second make a basket catch?'' Horton said. ``Denny says
that Moss has a lot of those catches. A defensive back tracking
Moss never anticipates when he's going to go up for the ball. Then,
at the last second, he grabs it. It's Michael Jordan at the rim.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's 78 receptions are his fewest since 1992 because he now
shares the spotlight with Moss, known as ``The Freak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That happens with a superstar,'' Vikings offensive coordinator
Brian Billick said of Carter. ``Cris will sublimate anything to get
to the Super Bowl, to get that championship. He knows that with a
Super Bowl win, he can be put in that group of guys among the the
literally the best receivers in the history of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed, 6-3, 219 pounds, will be returning to action for the first
time in six games after back surgery. His size makes him one of the
most dangerous possession receivers in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times, it's not that you don't have them covered,'' Tampa
Bay Coach Tony Dungy said. ``You can have them covered, and they
still catch the ball. You can be right on Randy Moss, and he jumps
up and catches the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Horton said that each of the Vikings receivers make the others
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mark of any receiver group is that it's deep enough that
you can't double-cover them,'' Horton said. ``They have three guys
who will burn you. When you game-plan them, you don't say, `We've
got to stop this guy.' If you stop Randy Moss, Cris Carter burns
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Trestman thinks the Sanders-Moore duo belongs in the NFL's
``upper echelon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are quality, big receivers,'' Horton said of Sanders and
Moore. ``You don't think of them as home-run hitters. They are
better possession guys who get seven to 10 catches a game. They are
steady, solid. If they get a home run hitter who stretches the
defense, it will make them even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapp said both receivers have tremendous work ethic, how
professional they are in their approach.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, a fourth-year pro, said 75 percent of what he has
learned has been from Moore, in his ninth season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned route running, release off the ball, recognizing
defenses,'' said Sanders, who had an NFC-high 89 catches. ``Rob's a
great student of the game. He's taught me how important film study
is. He's taught me a lot of tricks of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing that makes us jell together is we're both
humble men. We're not arrogant or loud. We're both laid-back guys
who can sit home and watch TV all day or play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said Rapp deserves a lot of credit for their success
because he allows them to use their strengths. &QL;

WHO PLAYS 2ND FIDDLE TO VIKINGS' TRIO? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few agree on who has the second-best receiving corps in the NFL
behind Minnesota's trio of Cris Carter, Randy Moss and Jake Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay's Antonio Freeman and Robert Brooks would've been a
lock had Brooks not been bothered by injury problems.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit has a great duo in Herman Moore and Johnnie Morton, but
Lions quarterbacks have trouble getting them the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can imagine how good they would be if they had a
quarterback there,'' one NFL assistant said.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is a contender. Jerry Rice, Terrell Owens and J.J.
Stokes combined for 212 catches and 31 scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount of difference between having two
and having three receivers,'' said Gary Horton, the former Tampa
Bay and Cleveland scout who is editor of the ``War Room'' draft
publication. ``If there is a dropoff to the Number 3 guy, teams can
take away the Number 2 guy.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't get the national publicity, but Jacksonville's Jimmy
Smith and Keenan McCardell could start for anybody. They've
combined for 142 receptions and 14 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Denver quarterback John Elway loves the combination of Rod Smith
(86 catches for 1,222 yards and six scores) and Ed McCaffrey (64
for 1,053 and 10 touchdowns). Shannon Sharpe is a tight end, but he
plays like a wide receiver. He added 64 catches for 768 yards and
10 scores.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' Frank Sanders led the NFC in receptions with 89.
His partner, Rob Moore, led the NFL in receiving yards a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   A big reason for the New York Jets winning their first AFC East
crown was the duo of Keyshawn Johnson (83 catches for 1,131 yards
and 10 scores) and Wayne Chrebet (75 for 1,083 and eight
touchdowns). They found a way to turn Vinny Testaverde into the
NFL's most efficient quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta hadn't won 14 games until this year. Quarterback Chris
Chandler hasn't had receivers as talented as Tony Martin and
Terrance Mathis.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati has Carl Pickens and Darnay Scott, but they weren't
good enough to offset the league's worst defense.
</P>
<P>
   So many teams have just one good receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas has been trying to find someone to complement Michael
Irvin ever since Alvin Harper left.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has a top receiver in Joey Galloway (65 catches for
1,047 yards and 10 touchdowns) but no one to play alongside him.
So, teams try to double-team Galloway whenever they can. &QL;

CARDS NEED PERFECTION, MADDEN SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When was the last time the Cardinals played a perfect game?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; John Madden believes they will have to do just that Sunday if
they have any chance at all to beat the Vikings. Oh, yeah, and
they'll have to hope Minnesota goofs up a time or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time two NFL teams get together, anyone can win,''
Madden said. ``I believe that since you've got pros on both sides
of the ball. But what do I think it would take for the Cardinals to
win? I think they would have to play a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   `` '' ``By that I mean, no turnovers, no gifts at all, you don't
have a kick blocked for a touchdown. But even if you play your
best, it won't be good enough if Minnesota plays its best.''
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the load will fall on the Cardinals secondary.
Cornerbacks  &UR; Aeneas Williams and  &UR; Corey Chavous will be important
cogs, Madden said, but he said equal responsibility likely will
fall on safeties  &UR; Tommy Bennett and  &UR; Kwamie Lassiter. He knows, as
does anyone who has seen the Vikings play, that individual effort
alone is not enough to throttle the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have  &UR; Randy Moss,  &UR; Cris Carter, with  &UR; Jake Reed and
some others, and you have  &UR; Robert Smith, and then you can bring in
 &UR; Leroy
 &UR; Hoard and you have  &UR; Randall Cunningham running all over, it's very
important for all those (Cardinals) guys to have a good game. If
they don't, the Vikings will have their way.''
</P>
<P>
   While Williams and Chavous have proved a lot this season, Madden
says that perhaps the play of the safeties may have been overlooked
a little. He noted that a lot of the Cardinals' pass coverage
involves zone and help from Bennett and Lassiter, ``and they're
doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   As with most analysts, Madden is impressed with Cardinals
quarterback  &UR; Jake Plummer and how quickly he has developed his
skills. His game management is another facet that Madden applauded.
He said a lot quarterbacks, even though they are blessed with good
arms and/or scrambling ability, have yet to learn how to play and
manage the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he is only in his second year, he knows how to do
that,'' Madden said. ``He can do the two-minute drill, the
no-huddle. It usually takes eight to 10 seasons to learn it and to
look comfortable. What impresses me the most is this. People talk
about `Jake the Snake' and how can move in the pocket, but it's
just the command he has of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And it will be Plummer who has the most control of the situation
as the Cardinals try to supplant the Cowboys as the team to beat in
the NFC East. Madden said they're headed in the right direction
because they have the most important ingredient, the quarterback,
and they also have a little defense to go with it, but he believes
more offensive linemen and a big running back are missing
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Not much surprises Madden these days, but while he was motoring
across country in his cruiser, he stopped for dinner in Las Vegas,
and it was like he walked into a brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to a casino for dinner, and looked (in the sports
book) and saw that Minnesota was favored by 16 points,'' he said.
``That's the most I remember ever seeing for a playoff game. I did
a double-take and went back to look at it again. I thought, `Geez,
I can't see that.' I usually don't get involved in that, but since
they had this information on all the playoff games, I went in to
see, and said, `Holy moley, they either think a heck of a lot of
Minnesota or don't think much of the Cardinals.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Madden also thinks that people make too much of the fact that
Cardinals Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin is laid back. He said Tobin reminds
him of former Pittsburgh Steelers Coach  &UR; Chuck Noll, who wasn't a
screamer, whose background was also on the defensive side of the
ball and who won four Super Bowls. He said for every yeller,
there's a more reserved coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be yourself,'' said Madden, who coached the
Oakland Raiders to victory in Super Bowl XI. ``If Vince Tobin
started jumping up and down, screaming, yelling and waving his
arms, you'd say, `What the heck happened to this guy.' And if  &UR; Mike
Ditka just stood there, people would want to know what was
wrong.'' &QL;

NEW YORK _ It's official.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA Board of Governors on Thursday unanimously approved the
proposed collective-bargaining agreement with the National
Basketball Players Association, paving the way for a season of
approximately 50 games, which is to start Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part _ winning back the hearts (and wallets)
of fans who had grown weary of the six-month lockout. With that in
mind, NBA commissioner David Stern said the league will start the
process by having each team open scrimmages to the public and that
the two exhibition games to be played by each team _ one home and
one away _ will come with free admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are happy to be planning a season. We have actually been
doing a lot of planning for a non-season (should it have been
canceled),'' said Stern, who added that starting with the 1999-2000
season, at least 500 tickets for every regular-season game will be
priced at $10 to lure families to arenas. ``So this is a pleasant
thing to have been dropped in our laps. And it is important for me
to emphasize that these are just a couple of things now, but we
believe that you will see the continuation of a fan-friendlier
NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-month lockout ended Wednesday, the result of an
all-night bargaining session between Stern and union executive
director Billy Hunter. The new agreement includes an absolute
ceiling on individual player salaries and a five-year pay scale for
rookies, both benefiting the owners. The players received an
increased percentage of revenues to be devoted to salaries, more
middle-class exceptions to the salary cap, and a graduated scale of
higher minimum salaries, depending on experience.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came one day before Stern said he would recommend
canceling the rest of the 1998-99 season at Thursday's Board of
Governors' meeting. Stern said that making sure the league remained
competitive was the motivation behind his threat to cancel the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (competition) is a real issue for us,'' Stern said. ``We
want the fans in all NBA cities, when the exhibition season is
about to begin, to have a sense that there's an opportunity for
their teams to compete and possibly win, and that's very important.
We think this (agreement) leads us in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that all teams will make money under this, and
that's a challenge to our own teams. Only the well-managed teams
(will turn a profit). But beyond that, as that works, as the
competition that we're going to continue to have draws fans and
television, the economic benefit of that is going to flow to our
players and the well-managed teams. And that's all you can ask for
in any collective-bargaining agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners voted 29-0 to accept the deal reached by Stern and
Hunter, using a show of hands, rather than secret ballot. The
players approved the seven-year collective-bargaining agreement by
a 181-5 vote at Wednesday's union meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The deal must be drawn up and signed, a process that is expected
to take a week to 10 days. Training camps are scheduled to open
Jan. 18, a date that also will kick off the free-agency and trade
period. The regular season, which will be heavily weighted toward
intraconference play, is expected to last through the end of April,
with teams playing occasional stretches of three games in three
nights.
</P>
<P>
   The postseason format remains unchanged _ the top eight teams
from each conference will make the playoff field. But that's down
the line. In order to address more immediate concerns, access to
team training facilities will be opened to the players beginning
Monday. Team trainers and strength coaches will be allowed to work
with the returning players, but coaches will not.
</P>
<P>
   Stern was joined by Hunter and NBA deputy commissioner Russ
Granik at a news conference, and all appeared relieved to have the
lockout _ and the often bitter negotiations _ behind them. All
seemed to think that from the end of the lockout will spring a new,
stronger NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad this is over,'' Hunter said. ``Our players are
anxious to get back and play. They are anxious now to be able to
join hands with David and Russ and the owners of the 29 teams and
to create a strong and communal relationship that we think will
take the NBA to another level, one that I think will be engendered
to bring back those fans, and do whatever we have to do to bring
back those fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only are we going to see an improved game, I just think
the relationship overall, particularly the players interfacing with
the fans, is going to be healthy and refreshing for professional
basketball. The only regret I have is that it took us this long to
get where we are.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In March, in a last-ditch attempt to uncover Saddam
Hussein's covert weapons and intelligence networks, the United
States used the U.N. inspection team to send an U.S. spy into
Baghdad to install a highly sophisticated electronic eavesdropping
system.
</P>
<P>
   The spy entered Iraq in the guise of a U.N. weapons inspector
and left the eavesdropping device behind.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 months, the device let the United States and a select
elite within the U.N. inspection team monitor the cell phones,
walkie-talkies and other communications instruments used by the
military and intelligence officers who protect Saddam and conceal
Iraq's weapons.
</P>
<P>
   This operation, described Thursday by U.S. officials, is at the
center of the current furor over the relationship between U.S.
intelligence agents and inspectors with the U.N. Special
Commission, which is supposed to be independent and not pursue the
policy or intelligence goals of individual members.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials explained in some detail the origins of the
operation, making clear how U.S. intelligence came to dominate the
inspections in the months before the United States bombed Iraq. The
officials and others insisted that the eavesdropping operation was
not a unilateral, covert U.S. espionage gambit, and that it had the
blessing of Richard Butler, chairman of the commission, which is
known as UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not shock people that U.S. intelligence did
everything it could to help UNSCOM undermine'' Saddam, a senior
intelligence official said.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-five percent of what was overheard in Baghdad was
useless, another official said. But the rest led the weapons
inspectors to focus intensely on Iraq's hidden weapons programs and
security networks.
</P>
<P>
   That deep look inside Saddam's most precious military and
intelligence programs ended in December, when Baghdad expelled the
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, a four-day-long U.S.-led bombing campaign began.
Cruise missiles hit some targets selected from data gleaned by the
U.S.-led espionage, U.S. and U.N. officials said. But there is
little evidence that the bombing did permanent damage to Iraq's
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the officials spoke on the condition that they
would not be quoted directly. It appeared from their descriptions
that they believed the inspection team would never return to Iraq
in its original form.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectors undertook their first electronic eavesdropping
three years ago. For the first two years, though it had some
success, its goal was frustrated by Iraqi security. In March it was
replaced by the U.S.-led effort.
</P>
<P>
   While some U.N. officials suspect that the effort was an U.S.
covert operation, U.S. officials insisted Thursday that a handful
of key UNSCOM officials approved the secret program.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the operation go back to 1995, after the
defection of an Iraqi general, Hussein Kamal. Kamal, a son-in-law
of Saddam, inexplicably returned to Iraq, apparently gripped by
remorse. He was promptly shot.
</P>
<P>
   But some aides who defected with him stayed out of Iraq. For the
past four years, they have provided the United States and UNSCOM
with a unique window into the Iraqi security apparatus, which had
successfully hidden Iraq's biological and chemical weapons programs
from the U.N. inspectors since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the United States and the United Nations
understood the depth and the sophistication of Iraqi security,
which includes thousands of officers commanded by the Special
Republican Guard, the Special Security Office and Saddam's personal
details. The most important target, they now understood, was a
sector of Iraq's Special Republican Guard known as the National
Monitoring Directorate.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was how to penetrate those networks.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. official said it was naive to assume that his
organization was innocent in espionage matters. ``The U.N. has been
and continues to be a focal point for espionage by everybody,'' he
said. Intelligence officers from most of the world's nations use
the organization as a base of operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rolf Ekeus, then the chairman of the U.N. inspections team,
needed help. He asked the United States to help him create a system
to listen in on the Iraqi security networks, many of which operated
at frequencies that U.S. spy planes and spy satellites could not
hear, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington did help, offering technology designed by the
National Security Agency and the CIA, which picked up Iraqi
telecommunications, beamed them to a computer in Bahrain and
filtered through the conversations for key words like ``missile''
or ``chemical.'' The information was shared with U.N. inspectors
and with other nations involved with the inspection effort _ though
not with Russia, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the CIA, several aspects of the program are
being withheld from publication to avoid assisting Iraqi
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout 1996 and 1997, the campaign was an international
effort, involving British, Israeli, Swedish, Polish and Australian
officers and officials, among others. The eavesdropping equipment
was brought into Iraq on each inspection mission, and used to
listen in as Iraqi security officers, speaking in code and using
scrambling devices, worked to conceal weapons and protect Saddam.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The U.S. officials said Ekeus did not want the effort to be
misread as a CIA operation, and that the United States did not take
the lead role, although ``we broke our backs to provide UNSCOM the
support it needed _ technology, equipment, people,'' as one said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, U.S. intelligence officials read everything gleaned
from the effort and distributed the intelligence to Pentagon
planners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we evaluate everything we got from UNSCOM? Of course,''
one said. U.S. spy agencies also interviewed inspectors
extensively, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, the commission had not succeeded in unmasking
Iraq's hidden programs. It was then, last March, that the United
States inserted its sophisticated device into the U.N. operation,
and assumed the lead role in the espionage. It restricted the
information gathered to a very small circle of senior U.N.
inspection officials. They barred Scott Ritter, the U.S. military
officer who had led UNSCOM's earlier effort to unmask Iraq's covert
weaponry and whom they suspected as a security risk.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials insisted that the information they gathered was
only what the commission needed _ insight into the ways in which
Iraq concealed its weapons. But they conceded that those very same
methods were used by Iraq to protect its president.
</P>
<P>
   It should be no surprise, they said, that U.S. cruise missiles
were aimed last month at the same people and institutions that the
eavesdropping campaign tried to penetrate _ including the home of
the man who runs the security organizations that protect Iraq's
secret weapons and Saddam Hussein.

NEW OFFICER POSTED TO A LISTING ABC SHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., Pa.)  (lb) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sam Donaldson of ABC News put it succinctly: ``Is
Shelley in this new job because Diane has confidence in her?
Absolutely. Shelley wouldn't be there if Diane didn't. Whatever
Lola wants, Lola gets, kid.'' Donaldson paused just a beat, and
then decided to be a gentleman. ``And that's the way it should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane is of course Diane Sawyer, the ABC superstar summoned to
try to save the flailing ``Good Morning America.'' Shelley is
Shelley Ross, one of Ms. Sawyer's favorite colleagues, who was
named on Monday as the show's executive producer. Since shipwreck
metaphors seem apt, Ms. Ross now has the job of stopping, say, the
Andrea Doria as it heads for the bottom of the Atlantic. Let's ask
an old television question. How does she feel?
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrified,'' she said. And then purposefully, ``But excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ross, 45, talked over a bowl of mussels on Wednesday at
Vince and Eddie's, two blocks from ABC on Manhattan's Upper West
Side, where technicians union pickets have been on the sidewalk
since a strike on Nov. 2 and a management lockout the following
day.
</P>
<P>
   Until Dec. 31, Ms. Ross could have been one of those pickets
herself. As a Los Angeles-based producer for the last decade of
ABC's ``Prime Time Live,'' the news magazine that was merged into
ABC's other news magazine, ``20/20,'' in the fall, Ms. Ross was a
member of NABET, the National Association of Broadcast Employees
and Technicians.
</P>
<P>
   She was out of work and Christmas shopping in New York with her
husband in early December when she met quietly with ABC executives
about the new job. They met at her hotel; that way she did not
cross the picket line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't,'' she said, ``and they wouldn't ask me.'' Ms. Ross
resigned from the union last Friday. ``I don't want to talk about
the union,'' she said. ``But I do feel deeply for my colleagues on
the picket line. I know many of them. They're my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   This is in any case a huge promotion for Ms. Ross, who ran ABC's
news-magazine coverage of the O.J. Simpson case. She also worked
with Donaldson on an investigation into the Navy's Tailhook sex
scandal and with Ms. Sawyer on the Menendez murders in Beverly
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Her role, like that of any producer, was reporter, researcher,
interviewer, organizer of the camera crew, writer, tape editor,
hand holder. But come Jan. 18, her new job will be to put on two
hours of live television five days a week, run a staff of 120
people, and try to revive the ratings of a show that now runs a
distant second to NBC's ``Today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done the big SWAT team projects,'' Ms. Ross said. ``But
this is definitely a new challenge.'' One of her first goals is to
make the program more important. ``I'd like to break more news,''
she said, ``and chase less news.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ross says she has the same ``perfectionism'' as Ms. Sawyer.
Her colleagues say she wins a lot of fights.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Donaldson: ``She'll say, `I think we should do it this way.' And
I'll say, `No, Shelley.' And she really fights it. She is not
someone the great pooh-bah can put down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sawyer: ``Everyone at `Prime Time' thought nothing of
hearing one of us in an arm wrestle with Shelley.'' Ms. Sawyer
added that she did not ask for Ms. Ross as a precondition for
taking the job as co-anchor with Charlie Gibson, the ``Good Morning
America'' veteran who is also dropping out of the sky as a
potential savior.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Jan. 18, this new temporary team will replace Kevin
Newman and Lisa McRee. Ms. Ross is permanently replacing Shelley
Lewis, whatever ``permanent'' may mean in network news. Phyllis
McGrady, an ABC vice president, is the ``executive in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sawyer said that she expected to stay on the program ``a few
months,'' and that she would indeed do cooking segments. ``If we're
doing the news the way we dream of,'' she said, ``I'm not above
frying a hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch, Ms. Ross was circumspect, but warmed up when she
talked about her old newspapering days. The most interesting thing
about her past is the three years she spent in her 20s as a
reporter and articles editor at The National Enquirer. She said
that her work there was at least accurate, that ``it was a long
time ago,'' and that she has never kept it off her resume.
</P>
<P>
   Her first job in journalism was at The Miami Herald, where she
worked as a part-time feature writer while still at the University
of Miami. (Back home in the Philadelphia suburbs, her parents had
told her she could either go to a college nearby or in Miami, where
her grandparents lived.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ross graduated in 1974, got a job as a feature writer at The
Pompano Sun Sentinel and was thrilled when asked to help cover
Richard Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   After The National Enquirer, Ms. Ross moved to Los Angeles and
spent almost a decade as a freelance television writer, which she
found ``incredibly unsatisfying.'' So she wrote ``Fall from Grace:
Sex, Scandal and Corruption in American Politics from 1702 to the
Present'' (Ballantine, 1988) and was the co-author, with Louis J.
Rosner, of ``Multiple Sclerosis: New Hope and Practical Advice for
People With MS and Their Families'' (Prentice Hall, 1987).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ross is married to David Simone, executive vice president of
Geffen Records, has two stepchildren, and is moving to New York
next week. ``I would like to point out that it's 80 degrees in
L.A.,'' she said. ``But I'm over it.''

REPORT ON EMBASSY BLASTS CITES ``COLLECTIVE FAILURE'' IN SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A State Department investigation of last summer's
bombings of two American embassies in East Africa found that a
``collective failure'' by senior government officials and lawmakers
over decades had left a number of American embassies vulnerable to
terrorist attack, senior Clinton administration officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They said two panels _ both led by Adm. William Crowe, the
retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former American
ambassador to Britain _ accused the State Department and other
agencies of giving a low priority to embassy security.
</P>
<P>
   According to the officials, the panels found that there was no
intelligence warning of the attacks on the embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, on Aug. 7. The panels
criticized the U.S. government as relying too heavily on
intelligence about specific terrorist threats in determining which
embassies and other diplomatic installations deserved protection.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 258 people, including 12 Americans, died in the
bombings, and more than 4,000 people were wounded. The panels led
by Crowe were appointed in October; one investigated the bombing of
the embassy in Kenya, while the other studied the bombing in
neighboring Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The combined report of the panels is scheduled to be released on
Friday. While the State Department declined to provide an advance
copy of the full report, senior administration officials read some
of its conclusions to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boards did not find reasonable cause to believe that any
employee of the United States government or member of the uniformed
services breached his or her duty in connection with the Aug. 7
bombings,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, we believe there was a collective failure by several
administrations and Congresses over the past decade to invest
adequate resources to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. diplomatic
missions around the world to terrorist attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is most troubling,'' it continued, ``is the failure of
the U.S. government to take the necessary steps to prevent such
tragedies through an unwillingness to give sustained priority and
funding to security improvements.''
</P>
<P>
   The report found that the two embassies had not been provided
with adequate security to protect them against large car bombs like
those used in the attacks in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both embassies were located immediately adjacent or close to
the public streets and were especially vulnerable to large
vehicular bombs,'' the panels found. ``The boards found that too
many of our overseas missions are similarly situated. Unless those
vulnerabilities are addressed on a sustained and realistic basis,
the lives and safety of U.S. government employees and the public in
many of our facilities abroad will continue to be at risk from
further terrorist bombings.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has acknowledged previously that the
ambassador to Kenya had repeatedly warned officials that the
embassy in Nairobi was vulnerable to a terrorist attack. More than
once, the ambassador, Prudence Bushnell, requested a security
overhaul at the embassy, where one of the bombings occurred, but
was denied additional security for budget reasons.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Bushnell was singled out for praise in the report for
``particular diligence and professionalism'' in ``seeking security
enhancements for the embassy long before the bombing, including
efforts to relocate the post away from its vulnerable location.''
</P>
<P>
   The diplomat in charge of the embassy in Tanzania, John Lange,
the charge d'affaires, and his staff were applauded for their
``remarkable personal courage'' after the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said members of the two panels were
startled by how little had been accomplished in improving security
in American embassies since a wide-ranging investigation of the
subject in 1985 by a government panel led by Bobby Inman, a retired
admiral and the former deputy director of the CIA. That panel was
formed in response to the bombing of the American Embassy in Beirut
in 1984 and the bombing the year before of the U.S. Marine barracks
in Beirut; the two attacks killed a total of more than 250 people.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Crowe's panels, whose conclusions were first
reported Thursday night by CBS News, criticized the State
Department and other agencies for basing decisions about special
protection for embassies and other compounds on known threats to
specific sites, since experience shows that terrorists often attack
vulnerable embassies and other targets without warning.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has identified Osama bin Laden, an exiled
Saudi and Islamic militant living in Afghanistan, as orchestrating
the attack. President Clinton ordered air strikes against targets
associated with his terrorist network in Afghanistan and the Sudan.

   Ordinary Parker Vector rollerball pens retail for $7.95. But
they do not have little white letters on the side that say ``United
States Senator.'' The Parker Vectors handed out as senators signed
their names in the ``oath book'' at the beginning of the
impeachment trial Thursday did.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the lettering makes much difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Parker Vector is nothing special, I can tell you,'' said
GEOFFREY BERLINER, a pen dealer in New York. ``They're giveaway
pens, so they're not going to give away very expensive pens. Would
this be a valuable pen? I don't think so, unless you're somebody
who's into, I don't know, tawdry sexual items associated with
presidents, and this isn't even that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pens matter in official Washington, where every loop and line at
a presidential bill signing is done with a different pen, the
better to create mementos that can be given to political allies.
And since the Senate trial of the president is the first such
proceeding in 131 years, the Parker Vectors acquired instant
historical value. Or, depending on one's view of the proceeding,
infamous historical value.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prouder of the pen I received when I was sworn in as a
senator,'' said SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER, D-N.Y. An aide said he had
talked about framing the swearing-in Vector, but not the
impeachment-book Vector.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina wants his pen to go to the
Strom Thurmond Institute at Clemson University in his home state
after he leaves the Senate. ``But he wants a case built to display
it in the office until then,'' a spokesman, JOHN DE CROSTA, said.

   Some got the Drudge Retort, a send-up of Drudge's breathless
style.
</P>
<P>
   They did not mean to. But the addresses are confusingly close.
The Drudge Report is at www.drudgereport.com. The Drudge Retort is
at www.drudge.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Drudge Retort began last spring, when ROGERS CADENHEAD, who
writes a syndicated newspaper column about computers and the
Internet called ``Ask Ed Brice,'' noticed that the www.drudge.com
domain was available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever owned it before me didn't pay the bill,'' he said.
``It was released to the public, and I was the first to register
it. Then it seemed like it would be a shame not to use that to put
up a parody of the Drudge Report.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Drudge trumpets a big story as a world exclusive, with
those words in capital letters, the Drudge Retort heralds a
``universal exclusive, except for Uranus and the moon of Io.'' Last
month the Drudge Retort reported on a resignation speech supposedly
drafted for President Clinton to deliver after the House voted to
impeach him last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to see if satire can keep up with reality,''
Cadenhead said, acknowledging that it has not been easy. ``I don't
know if there's anything we've come up with that is any more
far-fetched than what reality's coming up with on a regular
basis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything on the Drudge Retort site is made up. Cadenhead
said the logo for the online bookseller Amazon.com and the links to
that site were real and were ``helping to defray our server
bills.'' ``I have a feeling Matt Drudge is making a lot more
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, maybe not. But even Drudge has been checking the Drudge
Retort, which has been drawing 25,000 visitors a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go there when I can't get into my own Web site because
mine's so popular,'' Drudge said.
</P>
<P>
   Reunion Catalyst
</P>
<P>
   The well reported reunion of YOGI BERRA and GEORGE STEINBRENNER
was sparked by an offhand remark from ROSE CALI, who bought YOGI
BERRA's house in Montclair, N.J. (``He left cases of Yoohoo
around'' when he moved out, she said.)
</P>
<P>
   She is now the president of the board of the Yogi Berra Museum,
and as such had a chat with officials from WFAN-AM, the sports-talk
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `The time is so right now for this kind of thing to
happen. There's a mellowing process, and George keeps making noises
and Yogi keeps leaving this little opening,''' she recalled
Thursday. ``Yogi had to be ready to accept this. I felt the way it
could happen would be to have George come here. Rudy Giuliani made
the trek. Why couldn't George?''

   NEW YORK _ First there were the elaborately produced videos that
served as invitations to the birthday party for SEAN ``PUFFY''
COMBS, the rap impresario.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are the broken-in, spray-painted shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Belgo Nieuw York _ the Manhattan outpost of a Belgian restaurant
chain that will have an entryway decorated like a huge, iridescent
mussel _ sent out 200 as invitations to its opening-day party on
Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying the footwear was a card that said guests would be
admitted only with the shoe. One spray-painted an eye-popping
yellow) was a size 10 Joan &AMP; David pump that had clearly been
broken in. Another was a well-worn 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were able to get a bargain'' on the shoes, said ROBERT
BARR, a publicity agent who is coordinating the guest list. ``They
were not bought at retail.''

FAMILY'S LOVE IS FOCUS AT SUBWAY VICTIM'S FUNERAL
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNKIRK, N.Y. _ Years from now, most people will probably
remember Kendra Webdale as the young woman who was pushed off a
subway platform in Manhattan by a stranger with a history of mental
problems. As the young woman whose tragic, touching story was the
stuff of national news and tabloid headlines like ``She Was An
Angel.'' As the young woman whose case triggered a critical
reassessment of mental health programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, at least, Ms. Webdale was remembered fondly,
tearfully, by family and friends in this city 35 miles southwest of
Buffalo as someone who lived the richest of lives before her
private world was shattered in the most public of ways.
</P>
<P>
   She had, for starters, ``a smile to put Colgate to shame,'' her
mother, Patricia Webdale, wrote in a wry essay read by Msgr. Thomas
Maloney at Thursday's funeral Mass at the Holy Trinity Church here.
She had a wealth of passions, friends said, from jogging in Central
Park to researching screenplay ideas at the New York Public
Library.
</P>
<P>
   And she had the love of a close-knit family of eight that, among
other group activities, marveled at Dad's virtuoso Sunday
breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   It was an intimate family portrait the public would never have
seen had it not been for Kendra Webdale's death. ``We're famous,''
Mrs. Webdale wrote, acknowledging the tsunami of news media
coverage in the last few days. And yes, she went on, sometimes the
story of her daughter's death seemed ``like an `ER' episode.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't forget the tent-camping, strawberry-picking and
spontaneous hugging and laughing, Mrs. Webdale beseeched, for
``these are the things that matter in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe savoring the small beauties of her life was the best way
to make sense of something that made no sense.
</P>
<P>
   There are, after all, still more questions than answers about
why the suspect, Andrew Goldstein, 29, did what he is accused of
doing Sunday, and why Ms. Webdale had to be the one in harm's way.
And maybe there will never be any good answers.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, in stirring eulogy after stirring eulogy, friends
and relatives said that nothing could obscure the good things about
a vivacious, caring woman whom family members called ``Gentle
Kendra.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the influence of Kendra on us be framed in terms of those
32 years in which we saw beauty, in which we saw grace?'' asked
Maloney, a family friend who first met Kendra when she was 5 and
the family lived in Tonawanda, a Buffalo suburb. ``Or will it be
framed in the crazy last seconds with the madman? The best memorial
to her is people who say, `I will recommit myself to the ideals
that motivated her in life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Webdale was the third of six siblings. She graduated from
Fredonia High School in 1984, and from the State University's
Buffalo campus in 1988, majoring in communications. Grace and good
cheer were her hallmarks, whether as a volunteer at Brooks Memorial
Hospital or as the editor of two weekly publications in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she moved to New York City, getting a job as a
receptionist at a music company and accumulating a coterie of good
friends. She was living her dream.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Sunday, while she was waiting on a subway platform at
23rd Street and Broadway, Ms. Webdale was shoved onto the tracks of
an oncoming N train. She died instantly, and her story has since
haunted New Yorkers who have, because of dropping crime in recent
years, perhaps underestimated the raw terror of random violence.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Goldstein remained in police custody as officials
continued trying to dissect his actions and motives. But here, on a
brittle, snowy day in this city of 13,000 on Lake Erie, what
mattered most was giving Ms. Webdale the most beautiful and
dignified of send-offs in as private and intimate a setting as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m., more than 150 family members and friends had filed
into the cone-shaped church, most bundled in overcoats or ski
jackets to fend off the biting cold. Natural light filtered in from
the top, casting a wintry glow on Ms. Webdale's closed coffin. A
manger scene rested in front of the altar, flanked by two Christmas
trees.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic service began, simply enough, with a soloist
singing Simon and Garfunkel's ``Bridge Over Troubled Water.'' On
several occasions, Ms. Webdale's relatives rose to speak, reciting
poems and offering teary remembrances; one sister, for instance,
likened Ms. Webdale to a human tapestry in which each thread was
meaningful and part of a greater, better whole. Another sister
almost broke down in tears while offering prayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was moving,'' Ed Bremer of Dunkirk said after the
one-and-a-half-hour service. ``Tragedy is always around us, and it
makes us appreciate life.''
</P>
<P>
   As people emptied the church to the peals of the Christmas carol
``Joy to the World,'' the pallbearers clutched Ms. Webdale's coffin
and prepared for the final ride to St. Anthony's Cemetery nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The snow was still falling. Slowly, silently, the hearse
disappeared from view.

MCGINNIS INTERESTS BEARS  
 LEADING CANDIDATE, SOURCES SAY

<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Cardinals defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis
appears to be the leading candidate for the Chicago Bears' coaching
vacancy, even though he is not among the six candidates to have an
interview scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the Bears said Mark Hatley, vice president of
player personnel who is conducting the coaching search, will talk
to McGinnis as soon as the Cardinals' season ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all speculation right now,'' McGinnis said. ``Other
people talking are doing it without authorization from me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be on the sideline at the Metrodome on Sunday and be
successful. That's all that's on my mind. I've never looked ahead
to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatley interviewed Kansas City Chiefs defensive coordinator
Gunther Cunningham on Wednesday and was scheduled to interview
Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Joe Pendry on Thursday. He also
plans to talk to former UCLA Coach Terry Donahue today.
</P>
<P>
   Also scheduled to be interviewed by Hatley are Chiefs offensive
coordinator Jimmy Raye, Green Bay offensive coordinator Sherman
Lewis and Southern California Coach Paul Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, Raye and Hackett worked with Hatley at the Chiefs,
where Hatley was in the personnel department from 1987 to last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Coach Vince Tobin's staff with the Cardinals in
1996, McGinnis was a linebackers coach at the Bears for 10 seasons
under Mike Ditka and Dave Wannstedt, who was fired last month.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, who was defensive coordinator under Ditka from 1986 to
1992, has publicly recommended McGinnis for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely happy here,'' McGinnis said. ``I'm happy with
Vince. He's why I came to Phoenix. I'm not looking to go anyplace
else.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis has remained close with Bears owners Ed and Virginia
McCaskey, whose son, team President Mike McCaskey, will have the
final say on the new coach.
</P>
<P>
   McGinnis also is a longtime friend of Hatley's and the two
worked together one season at Texas Christian, McGinnis' alma
mater. &QL;

MOSS CALLS CARDS CORNERS `AVER AGE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Minnesota's  &UR; Randy Moss is nothing if not blunt.
</P>
<P>
   But when one catches two touchdown passes in his first game and
goes on to set the NFL rookie record for receiving yards (1,313),
touchdowns (17) and receptions (69), he can afford to be blunt.
</P>
<P>
   Moss was asked his opinion of the Cardinals' cornerbacks by the
``Minneapolis Star-Tribune'' and said:
</P>
<P>
   ``They are average corners, with the exception of  &UR; Aeneas
Williams being a (Pro Bowl) pick. But with him out of the mix, then
they would be an average team as far as corners go. He raises their
level to above average.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals reaction?
</P>
<P>
   Rookie corner  &UR; Corey Chavous said, ``Hey, that's cool. It's
cool. That's my only response.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was even more terse, saying, ``I have no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting safety  &UR; Kwamie Lassiter was equally loquacious: ``Check
me out on that Sunday (after the game).''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Cardinals safety  &UR; Tommy Bennett didn't shy from
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect it from him,'' Bennett said. ``He's a rookie, he's
made the Pro Bowl and broken all kinds of rookie records. He's real
confident right now and everything is easy for him. Of course, he's
going to look at us _ at any defensive backfield _ and say they're
average or below average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he has an attitude like that; he can easily
underestimate the competition. I'm not saying he will, but it could
happen.'' &QL; 
Feeling better &QL; 
Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin wasn't pleased with the Cardinals' practice
Wednesday, but he was happy on Thursday, despite the fact wide
receiver  &UR; Rob Moore bruised his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very good practice; one of our better ones,'' Tobin
said. ``The concentration and the execution was very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he wasn't overly wor ried about Moore's injury,
adding, ``He kind of fell on it, and we had them check it out, but
he was walking better at the end of practice.''
</P>
<P>
   What, Vince? Moore walks on his shoulder?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was catching a pass and Corey (Chavous) was on me and I fell
funny,'' Moore said. ``But I'm OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator  &UR; Dave McGinnis jokingly told Chavous not
to go near Moore for the rest of the week. &QL; 
Namath impressed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Joe Namath, who led the New York Jets to their monumental upset
of Baltimore in Super Bowl III, was asked during an NFL conference
call this week whether he had advice for  &UR; Jake Plummer or the
Cardinals going into Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plummer has proven he's game through four quarters, so I
think, somehow, the Cardinals are going to be fighting right to the
end,'' Namath said. ``As for preparing for a team like Minnesota,
there haven't been many teams in the past like Minnesota. So how do
you coach it? We had a phrase: A one-eyed monster tells no lies;
that's nowadays on that machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they (Cardinals) sit there and they look at those tapes and
figure out how they measure up. I believe, legitimately, they could
win. Arizona wouldn't be as far as it is if, deep down, they don't
have a strong desire to win.'' &QL; 
Going home &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It will be a homecoming for Cardinals offensive coordinator
 &UR; Marc
 &UR; Trestman, who grew up in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis Park,
played at the University of Minnesota and served two coaching tours
with the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Bud Grant hired me and got me in the league,'' Trestman said.
``I owe a lot to him. I learned from him and he shaped my career.
It was a major day in my life when he hired me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll see my family while we're there, but I've been back there
before and have coached against them. This is a business trip, and
all we have to do is beat the best team in the NFL.'' &QL; 
Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Fans wishing to attend a rally to send the Cardinals off to
Minnesota on Saturday should congregate at Sky Harbor
International's west cargo ramp area (southeast quadrant of 24th
Street and Buckeye Road. The gates will open at 10 a.m. The team's
America West charter will depart at 11:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   A welcome-home rally is set at the same location starting at 8
p.m. Sunday, well ahead of the team's scheduled 9:45 p.m. arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings will be without nickel-coverage cornerback
 &UR; Ramos McDonald on Sunday because of a back injury. &QL;

NO LOOKING BACK  
 MURRELL HAS MADE MOST OF TRADE TO CARDINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - On the heels of the Cardinals' first postseason
victory in 51 years, Adrian Murrell's phone was ringing off the
hook.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his 95-yard, one-touchdown effort, one call was
particularly critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Adrian,'' his 70-year-old grandmother from North Carolina
said. ``You know better than to look back. You should have
scored!''
</P>
<P>
   One highlight from the Cardinals' 20-7 victory over Dallas was
Murrell's 74-yard run to the Cowboys' 3-yard line. Although the
Cardinals scored on the next play, having an injured Deion Sanders
catch you from behind provides some big-league fodder for the
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel so bad,'' said Murrell, who looked back during
the run. ``He passed two other guys on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The play was one of the few times Murrell has looked back during
his career. He didn't last April, when the New York Jets traded him
and a seventh-round pick to the Cardinals for a third-round
selection.
</P>
<P>
   He liked their potential. With good reason. Despite the
organization's struggles, the Cardinals are the only team to get
Murrell to the playoffs in his six-year career. The Jets failed in
his five previous seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He came close. In 1993, New York needed to win just one of its
final two games but couldn't get it done.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Jets were 9-6 and needed only to beat Detroit, but
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Murrell insists he wasn't fearing a repeat of history in the
final weeks of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the cards remain in your hands, it's a better
situation,'' he said. ``When you have to rely on other people,
that's when teams sometimes drift.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals can't afford to have Murrell or any other player
drift when they face Minnesota on Sunday. The 28-year-old's success
this season has contributed to a balanced attack, and the team
undoubtedly will need an effective running game against the
Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's especially important in the playoffs and when playing a
team like Minnesota that can score so quickly,'' Cardinals Coach
Vince Tobin said. ``You want to shorten the game as much as you
can. And being able to run shortens the game more than being able
to throw.''
</P>
<P>
   Murrell has helped the Cardinals be able to run. He posted his
third straight 1,000-yard season and became the team's first player
to break that barrier since Garrison Hearst did in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, a 1,000-yard season appeared unlikely. In the
Cardinals' first seven games, he rushed for fewer than 70 yards
five times and averaged less than 3 yards per carry in all but two.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he's had four 90-plus games and has averaged more
than 4.5 yards a carry five times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the slow start was just a reflection of everybody
trying to get on the same page,'' running backs coach Johnny Roland
said. ``You're dealing with chemistry, things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Murrell, ``It takes time to catch on. It's a misconception
that players spend a lot of time together off the field. It takes
awhile to develop (chemistry).
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would like to have more consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   He is well-liked by his teammates because of his easy-going
nature, although he definitely turns his intensity up a notch when
he gets on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can be quite emotional,'' Roland said.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask quarterback Jake Plummer, who has heard from Murrell in
the heat of battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's told me off a few times,'' Plummer said, smiling. ``He's
just real competitive. I forgive him. It's the heat of the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the Cardinals' heat of the moment on Sunday. The Cardinals
would love to see Murrell cool off the Vikings. &QL;

SOME HMOS PLAN LIMITED COVERAGE FOR NEW ARTHRITIS DRUG 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID J. MORROW  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthritis sufferers who want to try Celebrex, a new
anti-inflammatory drug that was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration last week, may have to pay for the drug themselves,
as several of the nation's largest insurers plan to limit coverage
of the pill.
</P>
<P>
   Two large insurers _ Wellpoint Health Networks Inc. and Aetna
U.S. Healthcare _ have restricted the use of Celebrex. The United
Healthcare Corp. has given the drug the lowest reimbursement it
offers, while Kaiser Permanente of California is considering not
covering Celebrex at all.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for shunning Celebrex appear to be universal. Aetna
and United Healthcare are still reviewing the drug, and may change
their policies, but officials from Wellpoint and Kaiser Permanente
both noted that Celebrex is much more expensive than generic
brands, regarded by doctors to be equally effective.
</P>
<P>
   Experts worry that many of the early limits on coverage may
quickly evolve into a national pattern, which could be financially
troublesome for the 13 million Americans who currently take
anti-inflammatory drugs like Celebrex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is generally believed that Celebrex is safer than existing
medications,'' said Dr. Joseph Markenson, a rheumatologist at the
Hospital of Special Surgery in New York. ``If the HMOs don't want
to pay for it, well they don't want to pay for any drug, period.
The person who is going to be hurt is the blue collar middle class
guy who has no insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The resistance to cover Celebrex by some insurers comes as a
surprise to many in the healthcare industry. Many of the nation's
top rheumatologists have heralded Celebrex as a breakthrough, given
that some studies suggest the drug is less likely to cause ulcers
and gastrointestinal bleeding than many medications.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that evidence presented to the Food and Drug
Administration by the Monsanto Co., Celebrex's manufacturer, and
Pfizer Inc., the drug's co-marketer, did not fully convince the
federal agency. The agency asked for more long-term studies and
required a warning that the drug could cause gastrointestinal
bleeding and ulcers _ standard for this class of drugs _ be
included on the Celebrex label.
</P>
<P>
   Wellpoint Health Networks has restricted coverage of Celebrex to
patients at risk of stomach bleeding from existing medications.
</P>
<P>
   United Healthcare's 13 million members will make a copayment of
about $25 for Celebrex, twice the fee for branded drugs fully
covered under its plans. A spokesman noted Thursday that the
copayment for Celebrex could be reduced once the drug had been
fully reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   While physicians within Kaiser Permanente of California can have
the plan cover any prescription they write, Celebrex does not
appear likely to receive such treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser officials in California have yet to decide if they will
cover Celebrex but appear to be leaning heavily against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to encourage the indiscriminate use of
Celebrex?'' asked Dr. David Campen, who chairs the plan's formulary
committee. ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   HMO officials have become particularly concerned by the price of
Celebrex.
</P>
<P>
   One dose is expected to sell for about $2.40 wholesale, a price
that analysts applauded as affordable. Dr. Campen, however,
disagrees, noting that some generics can be had for two cents a
day.

HIGH MARK FOR NEW YORK STUDENT STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Texas, N.C., Conn., N.D., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new state-by-state study of public schools placed
New York first in the nation in holding students to rigorous
academic standards and assessments.
</P>
<P>
   The study, carried out by the respected journal Education Week,
comes as New York's fourth-graders are cramming for a new three-day
reading and writing test to be given next week, one of a number of
recent changes to which the study points as evidence of the state's
seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Quality Counts,'' the report _ the most comprehensive
effort yet to assess how well states are holding their schools and
teachers accountable _ found that overall, states should be doing
more. It measured achievement in three broad categories: academic
standards, efforts to improve teacher quality, and school climate
conducive to learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``States have completed only the first few miles of a marathon
when it comes to holding schools accountable for results,'' the
editors wrote. ``Most have a long way to go in making their
accountability systems clear, fair and complete.''
</P>
<P>
   The study said that most states had taken the first step, with
48 of them planning to test their students during 1999, and 36
issuing ``report cards'' on individual schools.
</P>
<P>
   But only 19 states plan to release public ratings of their
schools or identify the low-performing ones, and only 16 have the
power to close or take over failing schools.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that Texas and North Carolina come closest to
having all the components of a complete accountability system.
Those two also posted the largest average gains in student test
scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress between
1990 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   New York got fairly high marks _ ranking 10th _ for its efforts
to raise teacher quality, a reflection of a two-year overhaul by
the Board of Regents aimed at improving training, recruiting and
licensing of the state's teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut came in second in that category, just behind North
Carolina, reflecting what the study said are its high standards and
high salaries for teachers. It also came in second in school
climate behind North Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Its low accountability rating _ 30th _ stemmed partly from the
lack of explicit sanctions for schools that fail to make progress.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey was ranked in the middle in both categories and
toward the bottom in school climate.
</P>
<P>
   New York fared poorly in school climate, coming in 31st.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mills, the state's commissioner of education, said this
was because of a public perception of the low level of civility and
high number of disruptions in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, in his State of the State message on
Wednesday, said he would create a task force on school violence, to
be led by Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue.
</P>
<P>
   In measuring standards, the study used various criteria,
including the difficulty and range of core academic subjects, and a
variety of data from state and national sources. It found that only
a handful of states _ Indiana, Maryland, New Mexico, North Carolina
and Texas _ have a full range of policies to reward success and
punish failure in education.
</P>
<P>
   New York is good at sanctioning those schools that are doing
poorly, the study said, through its 9-year-old system called
Schools Under Registration Review, which can result in the closing
of a school and its reopening with new staff. But the state needs
to improve its intervention in chronically low-performing schools,
the report said, and it does not reward high-performing schools or
their teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, the education commissioner, said that he believed
incentives should reflect the environment and that while merit pay
for high performance might be appropriate for Wall Street, it made
no sense in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Schwartz, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of
Education, said that rewards were vital to real accountability but
that they did not have to translate into pay raises. Successful
schools could be freed from certain state regulations, he said, or
teachers could be rewarded in nonmonetary ways.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Wilkins, a senior associate at the Education Trust, a
Washington-based nonprofit organization that seeks to improve
education for the poor, said the real challenge for states was to
stay the course when moving to a standards-based system.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do this you have to be brave,'' she said. ``If you are
going to put a hard test in place, you have to look ahead to the
consequences and plan for it and not immediately substitute an
easier test when many kids fail.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The study identified six elements for school accountability:
tests that measure whether students meet state standards; report
cards that summarize the performance of individual schools; rating
systems that determine whether a school's performance is adequate;
targeted assistance to help schools improve; rewards for schools
based on their performance; the authority to close, take over or
reconstitute schools that do not get better over time.
</P>
<P>
   The report praised New Jersey for recent additions and revisions
to its assessment program and new professional development
requirements for teachers that are to go into effect in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But it said the state was understandably focused on its urban
schools after an extensive legal battle over the equity of its
spending, a case that was settled out of court last year.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Gov. Christie Whitman announced that New Jersey
would provide full-day preschool education for all 3- and
4-year-olds in the state's 28 poorest urban districts in what some
experts say may be the most comprehensive early-childhood program
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The state is also engaging in what is called whole-school
reform, meaning that the educational structure of each
participating school is entirely rebuilt with the cooperation of
teachers, parents and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The study gave voice to teacher complaints that relying so
heavily on tests to assess academic performance was narrow-minded
and led to a cramped kind of instruction, ``teaching to the test.''
But it suggested that there was little alternative.

STATE OVERSEER OF TROUBLED CITY CHILD WELFARE AGENCY HAS ITS OWN
PROBLEMS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The latest plan to rebuild New York City's troubled
child welfare system relies heavily on a small state office to
push, prod and strictly monitor the city as it struggles down the
road to reform.
</P>
<P>
   But scores of internal government documents obtained by The New
York Times show that the state agency, the Office of Children and
Family Services, has long been hobbled by staff shortages and
unable to carry out its basic mission of overseeing child welfare
in the city, raising questions about how well it will perform its
vital role.
</P>
<P>
   Workers from the regional office responsible for New York City
inspect only about half of the city's 400 group foster homes each
year, even though the law requires annual inspections of each home,
officials said in interviews. So many homes have gone without
visits that in an internal memo, the state described the safety and
health of the thousands of abused and neglected children living in
group residences as ``a critical concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers review only 39 percent of the city's child abuse
deaths within the legal deadline of six months, leaving stacks of
fatality reports untouched for months, sometimes years, without any
determination of whether city lapses contributed to a child's
death, the records show.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed by its workload, which until recently included
responsibility for 10 other counties, the state staff has also
abandoned reviews of city abuse investigations, evaluations of
training for city workers and follow-ups of previous state audits.
The state office's policy analysts have concluded that the regional
offices are ``insufficiently staffed to execute their
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, state officials agreed to increase staffing
substantially to settle a lawsuit filed by advocates for abused
children. Under the agreement, the officials promised to create a
new regional office that would focus solely on New York City, to
review all child-abuse deaths promptly and to conduct nine audits
of the city's operations over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented monitoring promised by the state has been
hailed as a crucial element of a plan that might finally transform
the city's child welfare agency, the Administration for Children's
Services. But government documents and court records show that the
state will have to revamp its operations to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say they already have taken the necessary steps,
hiring dozens of employees who will start in several weeks and
reorganizing the state agency itself. Lawyers for the children say
the settlement legally obliges the officials to keep their word; if
they do not, they can be held in contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're convinced that the reorganization of the regional office
in New York City will make a real difference in how we meet our
responsibilities there,'' said Terrance McGrath, a spokesman for
the Office of Children and Family Services.
</P>
<P>
   State officials, however, have failed to make good on such
promises before. Their own records _ internal memos, e-mail
messages and court depositions _ offer a bleak portrait of an
agency that has failed to enforce child protection laws and whose
employees have been frantically pleading for reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state repeatedly identified problems, demanded change and
then walked away without any follow-through,'' said Marcia Robinson
Lowry, the executive director of Children's Rights, the national
advocacy group that sued the state and the city in 1995 on behalf
of abused children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They totally defaulted on their obligation to provide legal
oversight,'' said Ms. Lowry, who teamed up with Thomas F. Curnin, a
senior partner at the Manhattan firm Cahill Gordon &AMP; Reindel, to
litigate and hammer out the state settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, for example, state officials promised to monitor New
York City closely after a 6-year-old girl, Elisa Izquierdo, was
killed by her mother while under the city's watch. Her death,
coupled with the dismal results of state audits conducted in 1989
and 1994, made it painfully clear that the failure of city workers
to visit Elisa, to identify warning signs of abuse, to properly
assess her mother's mental state and to keep track of critical
records were chronic problems, not isolated ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must restore accountability to ensure that children are
getting the help they need and deserve,'' Gov. George E. Pataki
said then.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the elegant, granite facade of the state's regional
office in Manhattan, the field workers knew they could not enforce
Pataki's mandate, according to depositions in the lawsuit, which,
along with other documents, were provided to The Times by critics
of the state office.
</P>
<P>
   The number of workers in the regional office responsible for
monitoring the city had dwindled to 37 from 60. The workers most
familiar with the city's problems, among the least senior in the
department, had been transferred or laid off during a round of
budget cuts in 1995, even though the audits showed the city's
sloppy abuse investigations continued to leave children in danger,
the records show.
</P>
<P>
   As top state officials reiterated their public promises after
another damning audit of city operations in 1996, state employees
began anxiously discussing the widening gap between rhetoric and
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Donald K. Smith, then a deputy commissioner of the state's
Department of Social Services, which was dissolved to create the
Office of Children and Family Services, wrote in a July 3, 1996,
memo: ``We have been so irregular (a liberal characterization) in
doing reviews of county operations, be they child protective,
foster care, etc., that we almost need a primer on what our
supervisory role means.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be in a position, it seems to me, where we are
clearly the ones doing reviews on some schedule,'' continued Smith
in his memo. ``We need to be the ones to monitor corrective
action.''
</P>
<P>
   But they never did, the documents show. Three times in the last
three years, after child-abuse deaths and the 1996 audit, state
officials demanded plans from the city's Administration for
Children's Services outlining how it would correct its problems.
But in court depositions, the officials acknowledged that they
never received satisfactory responses and typically failed to
insure that the agency had resolved its shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the overwhelmed workers in the Manhattan regional
office lacked the manpower to comply with their own legal
obligations, which include inspecting group homes, investigating
abuse in those homes, reviewing child-abuse deaths and monitoring
city operations. Some say they fell ill from the stress. Others
struggled on, hoping that someday the state would hire more staff,
according to internal memos and testimony in the court case.
</P>
<P>
   The workers started pleading for reinforcements in 1996, the
records show. But it is only now that new employees are on their
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're truly in a crisis situation,'' Fred Levitan, who heads
the state's regional office in Manhattan, wrote in an e-mail
message he sent to his superiors in 1997, a message he echoed in
court depositions later. ``We are unable to appropriately respond
to this high workload and comply with statutory requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Office of Children and Family Services
acknowledge that it took too long to improve oversight of the
city's child welfare agency. But they say they needed time and
legislative approval to dissolve the Department of Social Services,
which they said was too large to properly focus on child welfare.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, Pataki proposed the creation of an independent
state agency that would focus more narrowly on children's issues,
the Office of Children and Family Services. By the end of that
year, the records show, state officials had begun discussing staff
increases for their regional offices.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say they plan to staff the New York City office
with 48 workers, instead of 41, the number agreed upon in the
settlement. And they plan to expand the number of workers in the
five regional offices outside New York City, which they found were
also shorthanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody agrees it should have moved faster, but it's not
like they were ignoring the issues,'' said McGrath, the spokesman
for the Office of Children and Family Services. ``They were talking
about how best to improve the situation, how many people they
needed, where they needed people, what areas they needed people in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has placed the highest priority on
improving child welfare services throughout the state,'' McGrath
said. ``And when the Governor was talking about improving child
welfare, he wasn't talking about just a specific locality. He was
talking about the entire system, including the state agency. And
once the new staff is on line, they'll be able to meet their
responsibilities more effectively.''

NBA LOCKOUT LEFT MANY CASH DRAWERS LOCKED
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Through the 191-day National Basketball Association
lockout, the economic losers were not only the players and the
owners. There are the television networks that lost lucrative
programming and the advertisers who lost a reliable way to reach
young male viewers.
</P>
<P>
   There are the arenas that lost revenues and were hamstrung from
booking other events; broadcasters who were not paid, like Bob
Papa, the New Jersey Nets' radio voice, and hotels and restaurants
that lost patronage from teams and fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time a sold-out crowd here buys tickets, food and
novelties, they've spent $1 million per game,'' said Richard
Krezwick, president of the Fleet Center, the Boston Celtics' home.
</P>
<P>
   There are the companies that make and sell T-shirts, jackets and
replica uniforms licensed by the NBA, a $3 billion retail business
in good times.
</P>
<P>
   There are the concession workers, vendors, security guards and
ushers _ some paid hourly wages, some paid on commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't rely on this income,'' said Ed Piseck, 30, who made
about $100 a month as a bartender at McNichols Arena, home of the
Denver Nuggets. ``I just used it to pay off debt and for the new
baby's college fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars have been rebated to season ticket-holders
for unplayed November and December games. More will be refunded
next month for January. Millions of dollars more were lost by
retailers who cut back on NBA-licensed merchandise that the fans
were avoiding. ``All over, there were double-digit drops in
sales,'' said Chris McEvoy, editor in chief of Sporting Goods
Business.
</P>
<P>
   The television networks that carry NBA games refocused their
programming. TNT and TBS, the Turner Sports cable networks, will
have lost 50 telecasts through the end of January, and have filled
the gaps since November with films.
</P>
<P>
   NBC replaced its Christmas doubleheader in part with the movie
``It's A Wonderful Life'' and will fill its planned January
telecasts with taped golf, skiing and other events. The Fox Sports
Net has used classic NBA games and other programs to replace 546 of
about 1,000 games it would normally carry through local cable deals
with 26 of the 29 NBA teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a down year,'' predicted sports consultant Neal
Pilson, ``but better to have a down year that's a half-season than
no season at all.''
</P>
<P>
   How much fan apathy will affect viewership and attendance is
unknown. The uncertainty of post-lockout viewing is compounded by
worries about Michael Jordan's status.
</P>
<P>
   One of Jordan's newest enterprises, a $50 coffee-table book with
high expectations called ``For the Love of the Game,'' has
underperformed, said Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes &AMP;
Noble. ``It's doing OK, but people thought he'd be doing
promotions,'' she said. Michael Jordan Cologne sold well in
department stores and foreign markets during the lockout, but
faltered in sporting-goods stores.``Fortunately, from the start, we
created and positioned Michael Jordan Cologne as a
celebrity-designer fragrance, instead of marketing it as a sports
fragrance,'' said Sally Yeh, president of Bijan Fragrances, the
scentmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The league and players will have to woo disaffected fans, but
they will move directly into a season, an edge it has over major
league baseball, which endured an off-season and a spring training
with replacement players before resuming normal operations after
the 1994 strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wounds will heal by playing games,'' said Jon Spoelstra, a
marketing consultant and former Nets president. ``The league's
greatest promotion would be for Michael to come back. A farewell
tour would be a great marketing tool.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of advertising and merchandising dollars are at stake.
J.C. Penney, the largest retailer of NBA-licensed merchandise, will
wait until the season starts to advise its stores on restocking
goods. Business fell by 70 percent in markets with NBA teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``How the teams do may be the gauge,'' said Stephanie Brown, a
Penney's spokeswoman. ``I don't think they'll immediately call
suppliers to order a ton of merchandise.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Modell, co-president of the Modell's chain, said his NBA
business shrank substantially but the stores survived well with
hot-selling Jets and Yankees merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to wait a while to order more because so many
players don't know where they'll be playing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Sporting Goods Business reported that NBA-licensed
business was down by nearly 50 percent for the fall and holiday
season and orders would tumble by 80 percent for the spring. The
magazine forecast a smaller drop for basketball sneakers, which
were already in a sales retreat in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there are no games, retailers don't reorder, they
discount and get the merchandise the heck out,'' said Frank Vuono,
a former NFL Properties executive who is the president of
Integrated Sports International, a New Jersey-based sports
marketing firm.
</P>
<P>
   Reebok's basketball shoe sales, led by Allen Iverson's $115
signature brand, are down by 8 to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We produced 40 percent less of the Iverson product than last
year,'' said Shawn Neville, senior vice president and general
manager of Reebok North America.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the lockout compelled fans, owners, players,
television executives, capmakers, retailers and shoe retailers to
contemplate a season without the NBA, it made part-time workers
mull their low-profile plights.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Gottlieb, 28, said his family's four parking lots near the
Fleet Center in Boston have lost $200,000 without Celtics games.
``Everyone loses,'' he said. ``You just go on, you know? You hope
it comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   Pam Morgan, 46, a part-time luxury suite attendant at America
West Arena in Phoenix, earned extra money to give to her daughter,
a college student. During a Coyotes hockey game Tuesday night,
Morgan said: ``If they don't care about the little peon, they sure
should. If it wasn't for us, they wouldn't be employed.''

JACKSON PASSES ON BULLS' OFFER
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Reinsdorf, principal owner of the Chicago Bulls, placed a
phone call Wednesday morning to Phil Jackson, the retired coach of
the Bulls. Reinsdorf asked Jackson if he would reconsider and
return to the team for this season. ``They had an amicable little
chat,'' said Tim Hallam, a Bulls spokesman, ``but Phil said he
declined the invitation.''
</P>
<P>
   The call was made shortly after the National Basketball
Association owners reached agreement on a new labor contract with
its players. Reinsdorf's hope was, apparently, to give impetus to
Michael Jordan in his decision on whether to return to play this
season. Jordan had said earlier last season that he would retire
rather than play for another coach besides Jackson. He later
recanted, but he has still not announced whether he plans to play
again.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who left the Bulls with some bitter feelings toward
management and in particular to Bulls general manager Jerry Krause,
coached the Bulls to six NBA championships in the last eight
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Floyd, hired by the Bulls last summer as heir apparent to
Jackson, now has the title of director of basketball operations for
the team. ``We won't announce who our head coach will be for next
season until we know whether Michael is coming back, and if he is,
who he would be comfortable playing for,'' Hallam said. &QL;

FALSE RUMORS OF PROBLEMS PLAGUE A MALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DEBRA WEST   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST NYACK, N.Y. _ Ever since it opened in March, the huge
Palisades Center mall has been dogged by rumors.
</P>
<P>
   First, there were whisperings that a serial rapist was attacking
shoppers. Then a story went around that the developers were on the
verge of bankruptcy. Some heard that the underground parking lot
was sinking and the four-story megamall would soon collapse under
its own girth. Right after a bustling holiday season, the rumor
mill had it, the 3-million-square-foot, $390 million mall would
close.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors continue despite repeated assurances from police,
town engineering officials and the mall's developers that the mall
is safe and in no danger of closing.
</P>
<P>
   When Nyack's resident gossip, Rosie O'Donnell, told her
television audience on Wednesday about the scandal in her hometown
(``Everyone thinks the mall is sinking!''), rumor believers and
debunkers leaped at the chance to debate on Thursday's show.
</P>
<P>
   The mall's developers say shoppers should forget about the mall
sinking; it's all a bunch of hooey. The real question, the
developers want to know, is who started the rumors?
</P>
<P>
   The Pyramid Companies of Syracuse, the nation's largest
developer of malls, is no stranger to rumor campaigns. It built the
Palisades Center after a dozen years of lawsuits and community
rancor, and was not surprised when strange tales began circulating
because at least three other Pyramid malls were plagued by rumors
of sinking and collapse upon their openings. One, the Holyoke Mall
at Ingleside, in Holyoke, Mass., even inspired Jeanne Dixon to
predict that it would collapse after it opened in the early 1980s,
said Thomas J. Valenti, the managing partner who is in charge of
the Palisades Center. All of those malls are still standing, the
rumors long since laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who start rumors don't usually identify themselves,''
said Valenti. ``I have my suspicions about whether or not it was
intentional. It could be the competition. There are other malls
around here that would like to see us fail, I'm sure. It could be
the opposition. This project was fiercely opposed the whole time we
were building it. Or, it could be some nut.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the genesis of the tales, Jamie Hand, manager of the
Ultra Beauty Salon on the fourth floor of the Palisades Center,
told Ms. O'Donnell on Thursday's show that she believes the mall is
falling. Ms. Hand sees the cracks that run across the concrete
floors and feels a shimmy in the building that she said she doesn't
think comes from the indoor roller coaster, Ferris wheel, simulated
Nascar race, Imax theater or any of the virtual reality games that
turn shopping here into high-tech entertainment. The alarms she has
heard are not reassuring either. ``Every hour we have the alarm
going off in 15 different languages: `Adios, Go, Get out of here,'
'' Ms. Hand said on the show, clearly relishing her role as Chicken
Little.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many other people have shied away from visiting
the mall, perhaps fearful that their cars will be swallowed up in a
sinkhole. But plenty of others show no fear; 431,000 shopped there
last week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Brian Trager was eating pizza in the 2,200-seat food court on
Wednesday and discussing the rumors with a friend from Connecticut,
perhaps the only person at the mall who hadn't heard something bad
about the place. ``I think it's true,'' said Trager, 19, a college
student home on break. ``I think it is going to collapse. But it's
not going to break overnight. I think I have time to buy a gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Sgt. Timothy O'Neill of the Clarkstown police heard
the rumors, he has spent a lot of time investigating them. There
was talk of murders at the Palisades and people being taken out in
body bags. Then there were calls about a businessman who offered to
help women with flattened tires only to leave behind a leather
briefcase full of sinister tools like ropes, handcuffs and knives,
O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of a serial rapist, too. These were
especially troubling, he said, because even though no victim came
forward, rape victims often don't report an attack. The details of
the rapes seemed like nothing but an embellishment of the
businessman story, however.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkstown Supervisor Charles E. Holbrook, who fought the mall
for most of his 14-year tenure and has no intention of ever
visiting it, said the town's building department has gone out
repeatedly, checked the structure and determined it is sound. ``I
don't like it, but I think it's safe,'' he said.

 SENATE TRIAL BEGINS AGAINST BACKGROUND OF UNCERTAINTY  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a bizarre confluence of grave formality and
roiling confusion, the Senate impeachment trial of President
Clinton opened Thursday as Senators waged an intense
behind-the-scenes battle over where to go next.
</P>
<P>
   Tumultuous daylong negotiations that often threatened to
disintegrate into partisan warfare ended in a show of comity by
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom
Daschle, D-S.D..
</P>
<P>
   By evening, Lott and Daschle emerged to announce that they had
agreed _ if only to hold an open bipartisan meeting Friday on how
to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Daschle and I are not dictators,'' Lott said. ``We are
leaders that are getting some latitude by our conferences and our
caucuses, but we have to bring along 98 other senators. We are
struggling very hard to do that. We ask for the indulgence of the
American people so we can see that we can get it done in an
expeditious way, but one that is as fair to all concerned as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said he and Lott ``have worked probably more closely in
the last two or three weeks in trying to resolve how we're going to
proceed than we've worked on anything, at least since we've been
leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   That an agreement upon simply meeting was so difficult to reach
highlighted the extraordinary political and constitutional dilemma
of the first-ever impeachment of an elected president.
</P>
<P>
   The trial opened formally at 10 a.m. EDT as House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., walked into the chamber,
accompanied by 12 other House ``managers'' who will prosecute the
case. Hyde, his head bowed and his voice low, read the two articles
of impeachment charging Clinton with perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate then quickly adjourned, splintering into intense
huddles of Republican on Republican, Democrat on Democrat, with the
two sides occasionally reaching across party lines to confer.
</P>
<P>
   The sticking point was witnesses. Republicans want to preserve
the option of calling them _ House managers insist they may need a
dozen or more, including former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
and Clinton friend Vernon Jordan. Senate Republicans argued that
fairness requires at least the option of ascertaining disputed
facts.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats steadfastly refused, maintaining that all testimony is
well known and that calling witnesses would necessitate lengthy
cross-examination and other legal maneuvering by White House
lawyers and House prosecutors that could drag the Senate into a
months-long quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans proposed hearing presentations from both sides, with
five days each for House prosecutors and White House lawyers, and
then a vote on whether to call each witness.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats countered with a proposal to allow both sides to
present their case, followed by senatorial questioning, and then
capped immediately by a vote on whether to convict Clinton, thus
removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Conviction requires a two-thirds vote, which no one now believes
is attainable. But acquittal could come at any time with a simple
51-vote majority to end the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The wrangling continued through the morning until the Senate
gathered again in the afternoon _ hushed and seated _ each at a
quaint polished wooden desk with a spindled front and hinged top,
in a spectacle seldom, if ever, seen in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The 91-year-old Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., presided as Sergeant at
Arms James W. Ziglar called out the historic proclamation from the
last impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson more than 130
years ago:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye,'' Ziglar proclaimed in the still,
packed chamber. ``All persons are commanded to maintain silence on
pain of imprisonment while the House of Representatives is
exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of
impeachment against William Jefferson Clinton, president of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate then stood as Chief Justice William Rehnquist entered
the chamber with a six-member Senate escort. Rehnquist solemnly
swore the Senators to ``do impartial justice'' in the impeachment
trial. Each member stood and raised his or her hand as the roll was
called, walking solemnly to the well of the chamber to sign their
names in the ``oath book'' created for the impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere was heavy with the strange, yet awesome, sense of
history in the making, as the chamber proceeded over ground none
had trod before. Washington Republican Slade Gorton, who led a
failed bipartisan effort to end the trial quickly, returned to his
seat after signing the oath book, examining for long moments the
pen he used. As soon as the swearing-in ended, the Senate again
adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey Democrat Frank Lautenberg said afterward that it
``felt sad, and it felt a little bit awesome, when you hear the
president's name and you see the solemnity with which the
proceeding is conducted.'' He paused, adding, ``It had a bad
portent. It's not pleasant. It almost felt like kind of a
hanging.''
</P>
<P>
   Even many Republicans, including Lott, recoil at the idea of
having Lewinsky and her former friend, Linda Tripp, intrude on the
grand solemnity of the Senate chamber with Chief Justice William
Rehnquist presiding, to again recount the seamy details of
Clinton's admitted affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans contend, even as they watch their poll numbers
sink under public opposition, and even as they know that the
two-thirds majority required for conviction does not exist, that
they must follow the requirements of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Several said that to summarily dismiss the articles of
impeachment would be a slap in the face of the House, where many of
their colleagues put their political lives on the line, and invite
the White House to claim vindication from a partisan witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the White House took a two-pronged approach, at
once lashing out at the confusion and projecting an image of
disinterested calm. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton
did not watch the opening of his impeachment trial, lunching
instead with Vice President Al Gore and giving an address on
education as the trial was opening.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart also condemned the process as ``manifestly unfair
to the president'' because ``the rules get made up as you go.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart offered a quid pro quo: the White House would
``stipulate'' or accept the record of independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's report _ while reserving the right to dispute the facts and
their interpretation _ if Republicans would agree not to call
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Lott rejected the idea. ``Look, all we want is a fair process
that gets to the truth,'' Lott said. ``I think it's wrong if you
say at the beginning, absolutely no witnesses. ... Let's have the
presentations, the opening statements, the evidence, have the House
explain why they might need this particular witness to clarify this
particular fact or the White House, then let the Senate consider
that and vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said White House concern about not knowing how the trial
is going to proceed is understandable, but cannot be helped as the
Senate juggles the demands of two other branches of government.
``The Senate must stay in control of this process,'' Daschle said.
``We have to take into account the concerns and needs of both the
House and the White House, but ultimately it's our decision.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate continues its negotiations over procedure,
Democrats are working quietly to find the six Republicans they need
to end the trial with an acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   There are several possibilities, including Vermont's James
Jeffords and Rhode Island's John Chaffee. But for now, it's clear
that Republicans are sticking together, knowing they lack the votes
for a conviction, but searching for a way to resolve the matter in
a way that respects the House, meets the demands of conservative
constituents who believe Clinton should be removed from office, and
all the while prevents the entire proceeding from degenerating into
the ``unseemly'' spectacle they all fear it could become.

TRESPASSER ARRESTED AT BRAD PITT'S HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- After crawling into an open window at actor Brad
Pitt's Hollywood estate after midnight Thursday, 19-year-old Athena
Rolando got comfy by slipping into his sweats, sneakers and beanie
cap before falling fast asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Rolando was abruptly awakened by Pitt's regular caretaker at 10
a.m., who found the star-struck intruder in an upstairs bedroom
wearing Pitt's blue hat, green sweat shirt, black sweat pants and
tennis shoes, said Sgt. Willie Guerrero of the Los Angeles Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Pitt, who just completed filming ``The Fight Club,'' was not
home at the time. Rolando knew she had entered Pitt's home, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said that she put on his clothes because she was cold,''
Guerrero said.
</P>
<P>
   The caretaker swiftly called police, who arrested her for
trespassing under a private person's arrest, Guerrero said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Rolando used a chair to crawl in through the open
window. Because she did not force entry and police found she did
not intend to steal his property, they declined to seek burglary
charges. Rolando was arrested on suspicion of trespassing and held
at the LAPD's Hollywood jail in lieu of $500 bail for the
misdemeanor, police said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Pitt was at a meeting in Los Angeles and aware of
the intruder, but did not wish to comment on the incident,
according to his agent at Century City, Calif.-based BWR.

DOMINATING FLYERS LEAVE ISLANDERS FRUSTRATED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The frustration that eats at every Islander
finally consumed Zigmund Palffy on Thursday night. And he has
played in only eight games this season.
</P>
<P>
   After missing a wide-open net in the second period against the
Philadelphia Flyers, Palffy splintered his stick against the glass.
It was the third time he had misfired on a prime scoring chance.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy's failure to produce was emulated by the rest of the New
York Islanders as they were shut out by the Flyers, 5-0, at the
First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders (13-23-2) have not won in their last five games
and are far behind the Pittsburgh Penguins in the quest for the
final playoff spot in the National Hockey League's Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers (18-9-10), buoyed by Eric Lindros' return from a mild
concussion that sidelined him for two games, beat the Islanders for
the first time in three games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia got 27 saves from John Vanbiesbrouck. The
Islanders' Tommy Salo and Marcel Cousineau faced 26 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Because of defenseman Rich Pilon's sprained right knee, fans did
not see one of the game's best player rivalries, Pilon vs. Lindros.
It is a game within a game, great entertainment, because few
players agitate the Flyers' captain the way Pilon does. But Pilon
is expected to be out two to four weeks with a ligament sprain in
his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders' road strategy on Thursday night, a
close-to-the-vest trap, was quickly broken by the Flyers. Colin
Forbes poked in a rebound at nine minutes 57 seconds of the first
period to give Philadelphia a 1-0 lead. Forbes whacked the puck
under Salo, who was on the ice after stopping a Daymond Langkow
snap shot from the bottom of the circle.
</P>
<P>
   As the Islanders' offense continued to misfire in the second
period, the Flyers scored twice more to take a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Greig extended Philadelphia's lead to 2-0 at 3:35. Greig,
standing alone in the slot, slapped a pass from Aleksandr Daigle
past Salo. There was not an Islander within five strides of Greig,
who got his first goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Dan McGillis scored on the power play at 11:52 of the period to
give the Flyers a 3-0 lead. After Lindros' shot was kicked into the
slot by the Islanders' goalie, McGillis threw a high wrist shot
through a screen, beating Salo over his glove.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros scored the Flyers' fourth goal on a breakaway at 6:47 of
the third period, and Keith Jones scored 27 seconds later to cap
Philadelphia's rout, drawing taunts of ``Salo, Salo'' from the
rambunctious crowd. Salo was replaced by Cousineau after Jones'
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Following Palffy's lead, Salo, who appeared upset by coach Mike
Milbury's decision to switch goalies, smashed his stick on his way
to the locker room.

DISSIDENT ARMY OFFICERS ARRESTED IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Five dissident army officers who tried to deliver
to President Ernesto Zedillo a letter complaining of abuses of
soldiers by army commanders were arrested Thursday by the military
authorities, the army's top prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   They were already facing disciplinary hearings on other charges
and were arrested when they reported Thursday to Mexico City's main
army base as part of a routine sign-in procedure, said Alberto
Enriquez del Valle, a retired army captain who knows them.
</P>
<P>
   The five army lieutenants took part in a December street
demonstration by a newly formed organization of dissident officers.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Marcial Rafael Macedo, the army's top prosecutor, said in
an interview that the lieutenants were ``arrested by their superior
officer for administrative violations.'' He said he did not know
their whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   The organization of dissident officers, the Patriotic Command to
Raise the People's Consciousness, marched through Mexico City
streets on Dec. 18 carrying banners accusing the army of abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the organization has continued to irritate the
authorities by sending news organizations a stream of faxes and
letters outlining their grievances.
</P>
<P>
   The organization was founded by Lt. Col. Hildegardo Bacilio
Gomez, a 43-year-old army surgeon, and Enriquez, an accused
deserter who left the military two days before the Dec. 18
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   The army has declared Bacilio Gomez to be a fugitive. But he has
not been arrested even though he has met for interviews in Mexico
City with several journalists. The arrest of the five lieutenants
appeared to be the government's harshest action against the
dissident group to date.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Enriquez and the five lieutenants visited Los Pinos,
Zedillo's tree-shaded presidential compound here, in an attempt to
deliver a three-page letter addressed to the president in the
presence of a crowd of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers and civilian guards who guard the compound refused
to receive the letter, Enriquez said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, written by Bacilio Gomez, accused Defense Secretary
Enrique Cervantes Aguirre of ``submitting members of the army and
air force to brutal repression.''
</P>
<P>
   During the nearly three weeks since the dissident group began to
publicize its grievances, the letter said, the government's
response had been ``not to carry out a logical analysis of the
situations that generated our demonstration, to seek the causes and
order just remedies, but instead more repression and more
injustice.''

LAKERS' PRACTICE STARTS MONDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Something vaguely resembling the Lakers will begin
practicing Monday at L.A. Southwest College, but executive Jerry
West and coach Del Harris won't be there to see it.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA lifted the gag order on all team officials Thursday, so
West and Harris met with the media. But it will be longer before
they meet with players, because the NBA replaced the gags with
blindfolds: Players can practice, but coaches can't work with them
until the new labor deal is signed and sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Lakers _ and any free agents in town who want to
participate _ will work out under the supervision of trainer Gary
Vitti and strength coach Jim Cotta.
</P>
<P>
   And West, Harris and general manager Mitch Kupchak will
impatiently sit at the Forum, waiting to get to work in the wake of
the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure what our team is going to look like. I haven't
seen any of our players,'' West said at a hastily called press
conference. ``I'm sure some of them will look a little different
than they did a year ago, the younger ones. I'm sure some of the
older ones are going be a little bit rounder....
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are excited to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Just who is back remains to be seen. The Lakers have nine
players under contract, three unsigned rookies, could add a free
agent or two and figure to make at least one substantial trade.
</P>
<P>
   But teams talking trade can't pull the trigger until the new
labor contract is finalized, sometime around Jan. 18. They can't
sign free agents either, so the roster picture is fuzzy.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Lakers are comfortable knowing they could
field a team tomorrow if need be. And if all 12 Lakers show up for
workouts next week, all the better to get a jump on the other 28
teams. (Pity the Hawks, Rockets and Bulls, whose practices will be
limited to 2-on-2 drills because they only have four players each
under contract.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we're in a good position,'' said Harris, ``but we
can't start (training camp) anytime before (other teams) do
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Camp should open around Jan. 18, but where remains uncertain.
The Lakers are looking at UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara and a few
sites in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to start off a little slowly,'' Harris said. ``We
don't want to take the risk of injury to not-fully conditioned
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   The compacted schedule _ 50 to 52 games in about 90 days _ will
mean fewer practice days, so training camp becomes all the more
vital, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Several Lakers _ Eddie Jones, Derek Fisher, Tony Battie, Tyronn
Lue and occasionally Shaquille O'Neal _ have played together in
pickup games at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the team remains interested in bringing back free
agent Rick Fox _ who's still interested in playing here _ but the
new labor deal didn't make it any easier.
</P>
<P>
   Fox can command around $5 million a year on the open market and
has interest from a half-dozen teams. The Lakers are over the
$30-million salary cap, the new $1.75 million ``middle-class
exception'' won't be adequate for Fox, and Kupchak admitted the new
deal hasn't made it any easier to trade away salaries to create cap
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really a realistic possibility,'' he said. ``We're going
to be substantially over the cap, and to make space you'd have to
move two or three players.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, everyone is just happy to be back to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm energized again,'' Harris said. ``I really missed the
competition. I was able to get a little bit of that from golf, but
the golf course won in every case.''
</P>
<P>
   West, the legendary workaholic, admitted he's downright
``bubbly'' over the lockout's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are excited to be back. I will tell you it's been pretty
darn boring around here, and to be candid with you, very
depressing,'' West said. ``I think we're all a bit more bubbly
today.''

PATE CONTROLS HIS ANGER AND SHARES FOUR-WAY LEAD 
</HEADLINE>

   KAPALUA, Hawaii _ Even when Steve Pate made mistakes Thursday,
the result was usually positive.
</P>
<P>
   On his approach shot at the first hole of the Mercedes
Championships, Pate mistakenly grabbed a 2-iron instead of a
3-iron. Naturally, the ball carried farther than he expected,
coming to rest 45 feet past the hole. But instead of getting angry,
Pate calmly made the long putt for a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Pate opened with a 7-under-par 66 and was locked in a four-way
tie for first place with Joe Durant, Fred Funk and Billy Mayfair at
the Plantation course.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the strong trade winds that usually prevail on the
picturesque mountainside course next to the Pacific, the winds were
calm, and the field took advantage. Pate breezed through his round
with eight birdies and only one bogey, and he was happy to lead the
elite 30-man field, which is limited to players who won at least
one tour event last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course played strange without the wind, and I knew I had
to get some birdies,'' said Pate, one of many players familiar with
the Plantation Course. ``There are some low scores to be had. You
can make some birdies, and obviously I wasn't the only one who
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about choosing the wrong club on his second shot of the
year, Pate laughed, but there was a time when he might have reacted
differently. Pate's nickname used to be Volcano, because of his
temper, but he has calmed over the years, and it showed when he
made the 45-foot putt to erase his miscue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good way to start the year,'' said Pate, who would
love to begin this year by winning the $468,000 first-place check
and car that will be awarded to the winner. ``If I hit a bad shot,
I still get mad, but I'm not nearly as bad. I'm a more patient
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Because this week's field includes eight of the top 12 players
in the world ranking _ Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara, David Duval,
Davis Love III, Vijay Singh, Jim Furyk, Fred Couples and the
defending champion Phil Mickelson _ not many people would have
picked Pate to lead after the first round. But Pate has been a
solid player for years.
</P>
<P>
   He qualified for the Mercedes by winning last year's CVS Charity
Classic. It was an important victory for Pate because it ended a
six-year drought on tour. And it also reaffirmed that Pate had
recovered from the fractured right wrist he suffered in a 1996
traffic accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played poorly just before my accident, and then when I first
came back, I had no idea what was going to happen,'' said Pate, who
is 37. ``Forget winning. I was just trying to play. But I kept
getting better, and after about a year, I knew good things were
possible. Now I want to play as long as I can. I have a little
experience in announcing and course designing, but it's not
something I want to do in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the round for Pate was an 80-foot putt he made
for birdie at No. 17. It was that kind of day for Pate, who laughed
out loud when he saw the long putt drop.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he usually laughs after making long putts, Pate laughed
again and said: ``When they're that far away, yeah. Strangely
enough, I thought I might make it. I just had a good feeling. I was
kind of shocked when it went in, but I knew it wasn't out of the
realm of possibility, because I've had that putt here before, and I
knew what it did.''

<P>
   Some players who participated in last month's Presidents Cup,
like O'Meara, Woods, and Furyk, hardly feel as if they had an off
season. But Pate is feeling refreshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done anything for two months,'' said Pate. ``I
played social golf two or three times a week, so it's not like my
clubs completely gathered rust. I feel quite comfortable. I feel
like this is the start of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   And for Pate, it was a good beginning.
