<HEADLINE> Yemeni President: Israeli Intransigence Puts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdulla
Saleh has said that Israel's intransigent policy and Likud
government's failure to honor the agreements signed with the
Arabs have put the peace process in a serious jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Today's Qatari daily "Al Charq" reported that Saleh, in an
exclusive interview with the paper, said there will never be any
kind of contacts between his country and Israel, whether secret or
overt, until a just and comprehensive regional peace is achieved,
and the Arab rights restored.
</P>
<P>
On the strategic alliance between Turkey and Israel, Saleh
expressed profound regret, and described it as posing a threat to
security of Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
A military training agreement signed by Turkey and Israel in
February 1996 has generated fear among the countries in the
region that Turkey is aligning itself with the Jewish state
against the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Saleh also denounced Turkey's military incursion into northern
Iraq to attack the outlawed Kurdish Worker's Party, adding that it
constituted a flagrant violation of sovereignty, independence,
security and stability of an Arab state.
</P>
<P>
He called upon all Arabs to stand decisively against such
interference, urging Turkey to pull out all its troops from Iraqi
territory.
</P>
<P>
With regard to his country's conflict with Eritrea on the
Hanish islands, the Yemeni president reiterated his country's
willingness to accept the outcome of the related international
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
On Yemen's relations with Egypt, he described these ties as
strategic and based on full understanding and consultation between
the leaderships of the two countries in the various fields.

<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras of the United States
Easily defeated Frenchman Cedric Pioline 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 to win his
fourth Wimbledon Tennis Championships title in five years on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Seeking his 10th Grand Slam titles Sampras clinched the first
set in 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Serving first in the match, Pioline made an erratic start to
his first Wimbledon final with a double fault, although he managed
to hold.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, Sampras conceded only one point in his first
two service games before breaking again for 3-2, when Pioline
clubbed three backhand volleys into the nebut, when he fired
another volley wide, he handed Sampras a 5-2 lead with a forehand
volley into the net.
</P>
<P>
Pioline pulled Sampras back to 30-30 in the eighth game but the
top seed gained a set point when the Frenchman failed to keep a
heavy serve in court and Sampras moved two sets ahead with a
backhand volley winner.
</P>
<P>
The American won the third set 6-4 and the final.
</P>
<P>
Sampras has never lost in seven previous meetings with
Pioline. They met once before in a Grand Slam final, the 1993
U.S. Open, when Sampras won in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Pioline had a comparatively easy route to the final, beating
only one seed, No. 15 Wayne Ferreira of South Africa, in round
three.
</P>
<P>
Sampras had to beat another three-time titlist, Boris Becker of
Germany, in the semi-final. Sampras lost only two service games in
104 en route to the final.

JERUSALEM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli army officer was
killed today by Hezbollah gunmen in heavy fighting in the
eastern sector of the Israeli-proclaimed south Lebanon security
zone.
</P>
<P>
Major Nadav Milo, 24, was fatally wounded when Hezbollah
(Party of God) gunmen opened fire at his paratroop engineering
unit during an operation. He died later in hospital after being
evacuated by an helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers returned fire and repelled the attackers,
but there was no report of casualties on the Hezbollah side.
</P>
<P>
The fighting sparked heavy exchanges of shelling between the
two sides throughout the day. Israeli helicopter gunships were
also dispatched to track the Hezbollah gunmen fleeing the scene,
and Israeli fighter planes bombed Hezbollah firing positions in
the zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that three Lebanese civilians, two of
them children, were wounded during the exchanges of heavy mortar
and artillery fires.
</P>
<P>
Today's fighting followed a week of intensive activities
initiated by Israeli paratroopers in South Lebanon, which aimed
to haunt and disrupt the Hezbollah forces inside and beyond the
security zone. Half dozen of Hezbollah gunmen have been killed in
the week-long operation.
</P>
<P>
The latest death brought to 11 the number of Israeli
soldiers killed in South Lebanon since the beginning of the
year. Several dozens of Hezbollah gunmen have been killed inside
and beyond the security zone at the same time.

JOHANNESBURG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi today reiterated
his party's call for devolution of power to provinces.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a mass rally in Colenso, Kwazulu Natal Province,

"For this reason, the IFP has tabled in parliament amendments
to the constitution to give all provinces the power to organize
and direct police and policing at the provincial level," he said.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said that ruling African National
Congress provincial premiers were joining his call for the

<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 6 (Xinhua)-- The situation in the Cambodian
capital calmed down this evening after a two-day fighting between
forces loyal to the nation's co-prime ministers, but sporadic
gunfires could still be heard.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government of Phnom Penh today called on
government officials to go back to offices and the citizens to
restore their normal life tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The armed forces of the People's Party led by Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen have reportedly controlled the situation of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
The guards of First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh
surrendered three amored vehicles and some weapons.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Submits Proposal on Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) has submitted a
proposal to the United Nations and the Security Council
containing a number of measures aimed at easing international
sanctions on Libya.
</P>
<P>
The League's spokesman Talaat Hammad said today that AL
Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid submitted a joint proposal
with the Organization of African Unity (OAU) to U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan when he visited New York last week.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions against Tripoli for its refusal to
hand over two Libyans suspected of involvement in the bombing of
a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Mummar Gaddafi has suggested trial of the two
anywhere else than the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Meguid told Annan that the Libyan government has shown a great
deal of flexibility in responding to international proposals,
particularly those made by the AL and OAU, which suggest that the
two Libyan suspects be tried according to the laws of Scotland
before a neutral court to ensure a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leader had asked Annan to persuade the countries
concerned with the Lockerbie crisis to accept these ideas which
he described as "fair" solutions to ending the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief had held intensive talks in Libya with Gaddafi
and with African and Arab officials during the African summit in
Harare on means of ending the Lockerbie crisis, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The Libya-West crisis was discussed for the first time early
this month at the Harare African summit which called for lifting
the sanctions and taking temporary measures to help ease the
sufferings of the Libyan people.
</P>
<P>
Both the OAU and Al have been calling for a prompt lift of
international sanctions against Libya over the Lockerbie crisis
and aired support for Tripoli's overtures to settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, during his two-day visit to
the Libyan coastal city of Tobruk on June 12-13, also denounced
the UN-imposed ban on Libya and urged an immediate removal of
it.

HARARE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean opposition United

government for ''profligate'' management of the country's
finances when the majority of Zimbabweans are living below the
poverty datum line.
</P>
<P>
UP Spokesman Isaac Manyemba said, most people in this southern

profligacy.

Dollars and a further 5.5 million U.S. Dollars during the recent
Organization of African Unity meeting and World Solar Summit
respectively on the purchase of luxury vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"While Zimbabwe is the second highly taxed nation after
Israel," he said, "it is of serious concern that these colossal
amounts of money from the taxpayers are misallocated into
non-productive sectors."
</P>
<P>
"The profligate management of government revenue and the fact
of low employment rate, have combined to reduce many people to
paupers,'' the spokesman added.

LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Twelve policemen and 16 civilians
have been hurt in clashes between security forces and nationalists
after an Orange Order parade in Ulster, according to a report from
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that an estimated 1,200 Orange Order members
filed down the half-mile Garvaghy Road on their way back to the
mainly Protestant town of Portadown Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Riot police seized control of main roads in the area early
today in one of the biggest security operations in 28 years of
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The march itself through the mainly nationalist Garvaghy Road
in Portadown passed off peacefully.
</P>
<P>
But rioters hurled petrol bombs and missiles as security forces
pulled out.
</P>
<P>
They responded with plastic bullets. One man hit in the stomach
was taken to hospital and several newsmen were hurt.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government said today it was deeply disappointed by
Britain's decision to allow the parade through a Catholic part of
Portadown.
</P>
<P>
"The government have learned with deep disappointment of the
decision in relation to the routing of the Orange parade in
Portadown and have left the British government in no doubt about
our serious concern for its implications," a statement said.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Condemned for Tearing Koran Copies in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian teachers today
condemned Israelis for vandalizing copies of Koran in a school in
Hebron, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service
based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
They accused Israeli troops and Jewish settlers of breaking
into the Arab school and ransacking and tearing copies of Koran.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Israel Television showed the scenes in its
English program this evening.
</P>
<P>
The school is situated near an area where week-long clashes
between Palestinians and Israeli troops took place in the divided
West Bank city.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued today by the Jewish settler committee said
that the settlers had nothing to do with the incident, charging
that the Palestinian claim was nothing short of a provocation and
totally false.
</P>
<P>
The incident will apparently add fuel to the flames of the
anger of the Palestinians in the city. Furious Palestinian
residents launched a wave of violence against the Israeli military
authorites after a Jewish woman distributed insulting anti-Islamic
leaflets last weekend in Hebron, depicting Prophet Muhammed as a
pig.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government condemned the incident, insisting that
it was committed by a woman alone. But on Saturday, Jewish
settlers threw rocks at Palestinian residents, shouting "Muhammed
is a pig."

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh to Stay on in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's First Prime Minister
Norodom Ranariddh, who is on a private visit in southern France
since last Friday, has decided to stay on in France to organize
"resistance" against the Second Prime Minister Hun Sen,
according to Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted Sam Rainsy, the head of Cambodia's Party of Khmer
Nation which is allied with Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party, as saying
that Ranariddh, who originally planned to go back to Cambodia via
Bangkok today, "changed mind in the last minute" in order to
"mobilize the international community."
</P>
<P>
Rainsy denied that the delay to return home by Ranariddh is
"an admission of defeat," but he recognized that "the situation
is not very good" in the military field in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ranariddh thinks an international pressure against
Hun Sen is "primordial" for counter what he called "coup of
force" by Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh has confided military commanding powers to his
generals in the field, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Phnom Penh said that the troops of Hun Sen have
occupied the headquarters of the FUNCINPEC and the residence of
Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen has rejected an appeal by King Norodom Sihanouk for
talks and described Ranariddh as a "traitor."

<HEADLINE> Specialized HIV/AIDS Clinics to Be Formed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Specialized HIV/AIDS clinics are to
be formed in Zambia's major health institutions for people
infected with the disease.
</P>
<P>
This came to light in the resolutions passed at a three-day
workshop organized by the Network of Zambian People Living with
HIV/AIDS which concluded here today.
</P>
<P>
Willy Goma, the network chairman, said at the workshop that
the formation of the specialized HIV/AIDS clinics will enable
those living with the disease to get immediate and speeded-up
attention.
</P>
<P>
He noted that at present HIV/AIDS patients do not receive the
special kind of attention their condition demands because most of
them are anonymous, which leads to medical personnel to treat
them as other patients.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the workshop also resolved that HIV/AIDS
infected people should form a board to take care of the needs of
children orphaned by the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
The workshop has drawn over 40 participants from around the
country who were infected with the disease.
</P>
<P>
HIV/AIDS, one of the major killer diseases in Zambia, causes
thousands of deaths every year.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Seeks UN Support in Solving Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) is seeking the support of the United
Nations Security Council for its stance towards the resolution of
the Sierra Leonean crisis.
</P>
<P>
Sani Abacha, ECOWAS chairman and Nigerian President, directed
the ECOWAS committee of four nations on Sierra Leone crisis on
Saturday to brief the Security Council on the community's
initiative to solve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Foreign Minister Chief Ikimi made the announcement in
Abuja Saturday shortly after the committee met with General
Abacha and briefed him on the agreement it reached in Conakry,
Guinea, a fortnight ago.
</P>
<P>
General Abacha fully endorsed the committee's agreement on the
Sierra Leone situation, which approves negotiations with the new
military government, Ikimi said.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian foreign minister claimed that the situation in
Sierra Leone is degenerating towards anarchy, with the populace
embarking on civil disobedience and the military regime not
receiving support from any country since it took over power on
May 25.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi dismissed fears that some ECOWAS member nations are
giving tacit support to the Sierra Leonean military government,
explaining that nations which received the military government's
delegations have all emphasized that the toppled civilian
government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah must be restored.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Departs for Bi-Communal Talks in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
left here today for New York to attend the U.N.-led direct talks
between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to
seek a settlement to the Cyprus question.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, as leader of the Greek Cypriot, will hold
face-to-face talks with his Turkish Cypriot counterpart Rauf
Denktash, starting on July 9 in Troutbeck, north of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
Clerides told reporters before departure that "we are not going
to (expect) the direct talks to fail, but (want) to find a
solution to the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on recent threats made by Turkish political
leaders in Ankara, Clerides said that "if the Turkish side is
intransigent and a solution is not reached," then the Turkish side
will be blamed for the failure and pressure should be exerted
towards Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Vice President Bulent Ecevit was reported to have
threatened that if Cyprus joins the European Union, then Cyprus'
northern areas will be annexed to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
took control the northern third of the island in the wake of
pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for full EU membership in 1990 and the EU
decided in March 1995 that the accession talks with Cyprus will
start six months after the end of the EU Intergovernmental
Conference.
</P>
<P>
Clerides pointed out that "it has been made clear by many EU
countries that if a solution to the Cyprus problem is not reached
due to Turkish intransigence, this will not form an obstacle to
the Republic's accession course."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Confidence Building Measures, proposed by
the U.N. in 1992, will be on the negotiating table this time,
Clerides answered negatively, saying that "this meeting has been
called in order to discuss the substance of the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
The president is accompanied by two advisors, who will be with
him during the negotiations to be held July 9-13. Cypriot
political party leaders will also be in the area to consult with
him.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash will also be accompanied
by two advisors.
</P>
<P>
Envoys from 12 countries will be in the wings of the direct
talks, including representatives from the five permanent members
of the U.N. Security Council and the EU.
</P>
<P>
The talks will open with a special ceremony on July 9 with a
statement by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. In the afternoon
there will be a meeting between Clerides and Denktash in the
presence of Annan's Special Representative for Cyprus Diego
Cordovez.
</P>
<P>
Annan is expected to attend the closing ceremony of the talks
on July 13.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, July 6 (Xinhua)-- Fighting in Cambodia
plunged the country into chaos Sunday, with tanks rumbling through
the streets of the capital and thousands fleeing the fighting
between the country's feuding prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
Mortar, rocket and machine gun fire drove residents out of the
city on foot, bicycle and motorbike. Forces loyal to Premier Hun
Sen tried to close roads out of the Phnom Penh to traffic, but
that didn't stop thousands of people from trying to leave.
</P>
<P>
Armored personnel carriers and tanks rumbled through Phnom
Penh's streets while television stations repeatedly aired a tape
of Hun Sen accusing his rival, Prince Norodom Randariddh, of
preparing for war.
</P>
<P>
The fighting has killed at least nine people; more than 50
others have been seriously wounded, hospitals said.
</P>
<P>
Away from the capital, fighting was reported in the
northwestern provinces of Battambang, Banteay Meanchey and Siem
Reap.
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, Hun Sen went on national radio to deny he was
leading a coup attempt, but labeled his rival leader a "traitor"
and said Ranariddh would have to go.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a political dispute between one party and another,
nor is it a coup d'etat or a civil war like Ranariddh the traitor
has declared," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said Ranariddh's royalist party could return to the
previous coalition government, but refused to share power with
Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released in Paris, Ranariddh denounced Hun Sen's
power grab and urged Cambodian armed forces to resist the
takeover.

<P>
YAOUNDE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Brazzaville, the capital of Congo,
has resumed relatively calm after heavy fighting around the
airport on Saturday, Radio Cameroon reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic shots were heard this morning as mediators continued
to reinforce peace talks between President Pascal Lissouba's
troops and the forces loyal to former President Sassou Nguessou.
</P>
<P>
Meantime, a spoksman for Lissouba has said mercenaries are now
involved in the fighting, offering support to the forces of
former President Sassou.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the mercenaries are from Morocco,
Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola. The
mercenaries were flown in the country through Gabon.
</P>
<P>
Gabonese Minister of Interior has denied the allegation,
saying Gabon can not be mediator in the conflict and at the same
time facilitating a mercenary support for one faction.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated President Omar Bongo's commitment to a peaceful
settlement of the Congolese crisis.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that former President Sassou has called for the
formation of a government of national unity with an aim to
prevent Lissouba from having absolute powers if his mandate is to
be prolonged.
</P>
<P>
According to the Congolese constitution, in the event of any
impossibility to organize presidential elections, the president
mandate can be prolonged by three months.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore
and Vietnam today called on Cambodian leaders to exercise
restraint and resolve the crisis in Cambodia through dialogue and
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Acting Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in a
statement, "Malaysia considers the continuing peace and stability
of Cambodia as extremely important, both as a country having close
relations with Malaysia and as a country soon to be a member of
ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, along with Laos and Myanmar, is scheduled to join
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand
and Vietnam later this month as a member of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Anwar said Malaysia called on Cambodia's co-prime ministers
Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen in particular to bring an
immediate stop to the fighting and cease all provocative actions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Malaysian
embassy in Phnom Penh had drawn up a contingency plan to deal with
the situation, which includes evacuation of all Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
"We are continuously monitoring the situation," the spokesman
said, noting that there are up to 500 Malaysians in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn today said that Thailand

He hoped Cambodian leaders would be able to solve their
differences peacefully.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his country was ready to shelter Cambodian
civilians fleeing the fightings in their home country.
</P>
<P>
"I am not worried about new influxes of Cambodian refugees but
I can't help feeling sorry for the plights that people in our
neighboring country will have to endure again," Prachuab said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore said that it is "deeply concerned about the
deterioration of the situation in Cambodia" and calls on all
parties involved to exercise utmost restraint.

In a statement issued today, the Singaporean Foreign Ministry
called on all parties in Cambodia to "cease military activities
and restore calm to the country."
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement,
"Vietnam has followed with keen interest what recently happened in
Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
While regarding it as the internal affairs of Cambodia, Vietnam
wishes all parties of Cambodia to "control themselves" and make
efforts to find peaceful solutions, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam respects independence and sovereignty of Cambodia and
stands for non-interference in Cambodia's internal affairs, it
said.

<HEADLINE> US Economy to Rebound in 2nd Half, Survey Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy will rebound
from a sluggish second quarter to post at least one more year of
healthy growth, low interest rates and little inflation, The Wall
Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
That is the consensus of 55 economists participating in The
Wall Street Journal's semiannual survey. It was also a more
optimistic view than the group had earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the growth rate in the April-June quarter
was expected to have been at an annualized rate of 2 percent or
less, much slower than the 5.9 percent rate in the first quarter
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The consensus of the group on the growth in the second half of
1997 is an annual rate of 2.6 percent and some predicted that the
rate will meet or exceed 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is a much more optimistic view than the group had at the
beginning of the year when concerns about an economic slowdown for
both the first and the second quarter predominated.
</P>
<P>
Supporting the prediction, some economists said that consumer
spending, confidence, income growth and employment are all
positive to the economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
Some economists also worried that the biggest concern is that
the U.S. economy could grow too fast, especially if capital-gain
taxes are cut. Such a cut could put so much money in the hands of
consumers that the economy could overheat and inflation could pick
up, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Chairman of the Central
Military Commission Zhang Zhen has urged China's armed forces to
grasp high technology in a bid to improve their combat power.
</P>
<P>
Zhang made the remark during an inspection of a ground-to-air
missile division of the air force of the People's Liberation Army
(PLA) here today.
</P>
<P>
"The smooth return of Hong Kong has come about because our
country has become stronger," Zhang said. "Therefore, we must do a
good job of economic construction under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China's Central Committee with General
Secretary Jiang Zemin at the core. And we must, with this as the
prerequisite, do a better job of national defense and make our due
contribution to the safeguarding of the socialist modernization
drive."

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Condemns Anti-Muslim Acts in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary-General
Esmat Abdul Meguid today condemned the recent distribution of
anti-Islamic posters by Jewish settlers and the tearing of Koran
copies in the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In a strong-worded statement, Meguid described the
perpetrations by Jewish settlers against Islam and Prophet
Muhammad as "unethical slur acts."
</P>
<P>
"Such acts could trigger violence and sedition in the region
which has already been suffering from tension due to Israeli
provocative policies," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Hebron has been the scene of almost daily clashes since an
Israeli woman put up posters on Palestinian shops last weekend
depicting the Prophet Muhammad as a pig.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leader lashed out at the offensive posters and
denounced the Jewish settlers who tore the Holy Koran to pieces in
a Hebron school.
</P>
<P>
"Such unethical foolish acts are considered as disdainful to
religions and clearly demonstrate that there are some that do not
want peace and co-existence with peoples of the region and other
religions," he added.
</P>
<P>
In face of escalating clashes in the Palestinian territories,
the Cairo-based Arab League is considering the possibilities of
holding an Arab summit to discuss the deadlocked Mideast peace
process that collapsed in March since Israel began construction of
a new Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs
Zakareya Mohammed Ismail, said Sunday that the diplomatic moves
and bilateral contacts taking place among Arab leaders send a
message on the dangers of the Israeli settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
But Arab League has not yet received any Palestinian request to
convene such a summit, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Parliament to Discuss Motion Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Parliament will
discuss an interrogation motion against Deputy Prime Minister
and Finance Minister Nasser Al-Rudhan over financial
irregularities, Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The motion was presented by three parliamentary members
relating to violation of public funds regulations, the KUNA
quoted official sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The motion, which was submitted by liberal parliamentary
members Sami Al-Mneis, Ahmad Al-Moleifi and Meshari Al-Osaimi,
covers three main topics all related to public funds
irregularities, misuse of funds and implementation of old laws,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers said in their motion that Al-Rudhan "needlessly
wasted state money" and failed to "collect money owned to the
government." But they gave no details of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mneis said that the interrogation motion was necessary
within the framework of efforts to protect public funds, adding
that "it reflects the public opinion's keenness on protecting
public funds."
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti cabinet has expressed its confidence of the Kuwaiti
leadership on Al-Rudhan, who became finance minister in April
1991, during a meeting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti acting Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh
Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah also said last Saturday that
the cabinet was keen on supporting Al-Rudhan in the parliament
interrogation motion.
</P>
<P>
The measure would be the first of its kind since the election
of the current Parliament in October 1996 in the country.
</P>
<P>
Al-Rudhan chairs the Kuwait Investment Authority which
manages the state's foreign investments of about 40 billion
U.S. dollars, the Central Bank and the Kuwait Airways.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Countries Calls for Dialogue in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia, Thailand and
Singapore today called on Cambodian leaders to resolve the crisis
in Cambodia through dialogue and peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Acting Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in a
statement, "Malaysia considers the continuing peace and stability
of Cambodia as extremely important, both as a country having close
relations with Malaysia and as a country soon to be a member of
ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, along with Laos and Myanmar, is scheduled to join
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand
and Vietnam later this month as a member of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Anwar said Malaysia called on Cambodia's co-prime ministers
Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen in particular to bring an
immediate stop to the fighting and cease all provocative actions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Malaysian
embassy in Phnom Penh had drawn up a contingency plan to deal with
the situation, which includes evacuation of all Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
"We are continuously monitoring the situation," the spokesman
said, noting that there are up to 500 Malaysians in Cambodia.
</P>

Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn today said that Thailand
considers the recent fighting in Phnom Penh internal affairs of
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
He hoped Cambodian leaders would be able to solve their
differences peacefully.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his country was ready to shelter Cambodian
civilians fleeing the fightings in their home country.
</P>
<P>
"I am not worried about new influxes of Cambodian refugees but
I can't help feeling sorry for the plights that people in our
neighboring country will have to endure again," Prachuab said.
</P>
<P>
Singapore said that it is "deeply concerned about the
deterioration of the situation in Cambodia" and calls on all
parties involved to exercise utmost restraint.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, the Singaporean Foreign Ministry
called on all parties in Cambodia to "cease military activities
and restore calm to the country."

Reports said that heavy fighting raged across Phnom Penh on
Sunday as forces loyal to the co-prime ministers, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh and Hun Sen, battled for the second day.

<HEADLINE> British Painter Johnson Expected To Arrive in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- British architectural painter Ben
Johnson is expected to arrive here today for the unveiling
ceremony of his painting on Hong Kong panorama, which was
commissioned by Hongkong Telecom and Cable and Wireless to
celebrate Hong Kong's historical return to China.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release circulated here, the Hongkong
Telecom will present this work of art to the government of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) at an unveiling
ceremony held on Wednesday at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
HKSAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa is expected to accept the
painting at the ceremony on behalf of the Hong Kong people, the
press release said, adding that it will then remain on permanent
display at the center.
</P>
<P>
Describing the 51-year-old painter as world-renowned, the press
release said that the work of art represents a panorama view of
Hong Kong from the Peak as it appears on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
It is the result of three-year work by Johnson and his team of
six to record in minute detail over 3,000 buildings, almost every
building currently visible from the Peak, the press release
said. With more than 500 colors used, the acrylic on canvas cost a
total of 10,860 hours.
</P>
<P>
Richard Brown, chief executive of Cable and Wireless,
said: "Johnson's marvelous work represents not only the rich
historical tapestry of this fascinating city, but its brave and
exciting journey into the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
Hongkong Telecom's Chief Executive Linus Cheung said that
"there is little doubt that his painting of Hong Kong, created at
such a historical time, will endure for centuries to come as one
of the main tangible symbols of Hong Kong's history."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nepal, India Conclude Talks on Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and India have concluded
their five-day talks about the issue of mapping and demarcation of
Nepal's western frontier with India, but without making a decision
as directed by the prime ministers of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had a useful exchange of views on relevant facts,
but they failed to live up to the expectations of the prime
ministers of the two countries, a Nepali Foreign Ministry
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Nepal in early June, Indian Prime Minister
Inder Kumar Gujral and his Nepali counterpart Lokendra Bahadur
Chand agreed to direct their survey officials to meet within a
month on border demarcation and conclude with a decision.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the third meeting of the Joint Working Group
constituted by the Nepal-India Joint Technical Level Boundary
Committee concluded here today in a cordial and warm atmosphere,
and both sides have agreed to continue the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Facing the survey technicians of the two countries are two
thorny issues: the source of Mahakali river and whether the
Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) camp at Kalapani falls in the
Nepalese territory or in the Indian territory.
</P>
<P>
India has been claiming since 1962 that the Kalapani area falls
in its side.
</P>
<P>
Nepal refutes this claim as an unsound one, arguing that the
Sugauli Treaty of 1816, signed by the Nepali government and the
then British Indian government, provides that Nepal shall have no
claims over land situated west of Mahakali river, yet the ITBP
camp in Kalapani is situated east of the river which is a
territory of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The Nepalese think that India has been occupying their
territory.
</P>
<P>
As to the source of Mahakali river, India has been claiming
that the Kalapani is the right one, which is an artificially
created pond by Mahakali river. The water from the pond flows for
about 100 meters before joining Mahakali river.
</P>
<P>
A hand drawn map of 1837 by JB Tasen, an Indian national, shows
Limpiyadhura as the source. If it is accepted as authentic, three
villages could fall into the Nepali fold.
</P>
<P>
Later maps made by India show the river starting from Lepu Lekh
as the border river between the two countries, terming the one
starting from Limpiyadhura as Kuti river and that starting from
Lipu Lekh as Mahakali river. The former is at least four times
bigger than the latter.
</P>
<P>
Nepali and Indian officials met early this year but could only
agree to exchange maps and documents of the area prepared by each
other and to study them independently until August.
</P>
<P>
While visiting Nepal in early June, both Gujral and Chand
agreed to speed up the process of mapping and demarcation of the
Kalapani area.
</P>
<P>
The resolution of the above-mentioned two issues will, among
other things, pave the way for a faster execution of the
Pancheswor multipurpose project under the scheme of the Mahakali
Integrated Development Treaty signed in February 1996 between
Nepal and India.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Accuses Opposition of Enforcing Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina today accused the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) of enforcing a countrywide strike on July 3.
</P>
<P>
Hasina, who returned home on Sunday night after a six-day visit
to Japan, told a press conference that it was unfortunate the BNP
had enforced a strike at a time when she was frantically engaged
in fetching Japanese investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone should rise above petty personal interest and should
not hanker after power and wealth at the cost of national and
public interest," said Hasina, who took office after defeating the
BNP on the general polls in June last year.
</P>
<P>
"I failed to find any justifiability in their political
program," Sheikh Hasina said, adding the BNP could not derive any
benefit out of the strike.
</P>
<P>
The BNP, alleging Hasina's government of jeopardizing the
economy by imposing new and extended taxes on industrial raw
materials, machinery and spares, enforced a countrywide half-day
strike on July 3 to protest the national budget, which was passed
in Parliament on June 30.
</P>
<P>
"The BNP is looking for issues to provoke the masses. The
victory of BNP's candidate in the Manikganj bypoll on June 30, and
withdrawal of some proposals of taxes from the national budget
actually took away the BNP's chance of political agitation," said
Hasina.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hasina also said that she is trying to have good
relations with the opposition, "but they seem to misunderstand
us".
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also expressed her concern over the BNP
chairperson Khaleda Zia's repeated refusal to appear before the
nation over television to let the people know her allegations.
</P>
<P>
"Even I had proposed Khaleda Zia to appear before the nation
with her jointly in an open debate -- I shall tell my programs and
policies and She (Khaleda) will tell her allegations -- the people
finally will judge," she said.

MADRID, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) was set up by the Washington Treaty of April
1949 as a system of Western collective defence.
</P>
<P>
Over the next several decades, in accordance with Article 10 of
the treaty, four countries joined the initial 12 signatories.
</P>
<P>
It comprises currently 16 member states. They are: Belgium,

enlargement that would reach to their east, as part of an
evolutionary process.
</P>
<P>
In the three and a half years since the 1994 Summit, NATO and

Final Appeal after the Chinese and British sides reached an
agreement two years ago, and received a government fund of over 45
million Hong Kong dollars (about 6 million US dollars) for
internal renovations.
</P>
<P>
The ground floor of the building is expected to be used for the
court library and the judges' offices, while the courtroom will
be on the first floor, local media said.
</P>
<P>
To date, the renovations have entered into the final stage,
with a red-and-white bauhinia emblem of the HKSAR and a
Chinese-English sign of the court already hung out over the main
entrance of the building.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong had no power of final adjudication during the 156
years of the British rule, which ended at midnight on June 30.

<P>
PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's First Prime Minister
Norodom Ranariddh will meet today with Claude Martin, the French
envoy to Cambodia sent by the G-8 Denver summit last month, and a
Japanese envoy.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh told Agence France-Presse (AFP) in his residence in
Aix-en-Provence in southeastern France that he would stay abroad
to "explain to the international community that only the formula
of a two-headed government is acceptable today in Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
He said he left Cambodia last Friday "against his will" and at
the request of his generals, who had sensed the coming of a coup
d'etat by Hun Sen, the country's second prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said he left Cambodia because the country "absolutely needs
an envoy abroad."
</P>
<P>
Same Rainsy, head of Cambodia's opposition Khmer Nation party,
told AFP that the royalist forces supporting Ranariddh are now
controlling the western part of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
He said the provinces of Battambang, Banteay Meanchey and Oddor
Meanchey, as well as part of the province of Siem Reap, are under
the control of the royalist forces.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Mark 60th Anniversary of July 7 Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese leaders and over 1,000
other people from all walks of life marked the 60th anniversary
here today of the July 7 Incident, the opening salvo in the
nation's war of resistance against Japanese invasion (1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the gathering, an opening ceremony was held
for the second part of the Memorial Hall of the War of Resistance
Against Japanese Aggression, located near west Beijing's Lugou
Bridge (Marco Polo Bridge), where the incident broke out on July
7, 1937.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin wrote an inscription for the
hall. In the inscription, Jiang, who is also general secretary of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and
chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), called on the
Chinese people to hold high the banner of patriotism and to become
well acquainted with the historical facts of the incident.
</P>
<P>
Attending the gathering were Liu Huaqing, member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee and the CMC's vice-chairman, and Ding Guangen, member of
the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of the
Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
On July 7, 1937 Japanese troops provoked the incident and
encountered stiff resistance from Chinese forces at Lugou
Bridge. The incident marked the start of the Chinese people's
eight-year Anti-Japanese War.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee, told the gathering that the defeat of the Japanese in
the war represented the first full victory over a foreign invader
in contemporary Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people should never forget their history, and
should spare no efforts to build the motherland into a prosperous
and modern socialist country, noted Wei, who is also secretary of
the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
He urged people to take advantage of the hall to promote
education in patriotism.
</P>
<P>
The memorial hall is China's only museum that fully displays
the history of the Anti-Japanese War. Its second-phase expansion
project was launched two years ago, at a cost of some 70 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other commemorative activities were held across the
country today, including the northeast China provinces of
Liaoning, Heilongjiang and Jilin, as well as Hebei and Shandong
provinces, all of which saw major fighting during the war.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's largest city, more than 1,000 students
visited an exhibition on the Nanjing Massacre, in which some
300,000 Chinese civilians in Nanjing City were killed by Japanese
troops in 1937.

PHNOM PENH, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Phnom Penh municipal
government announced today to lift a curfew imposed in the capital
after fightings erupted Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two-day-old curfew from 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. local time
was lifted because the situation in Phnom Penh has already calmed
down, city authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Also today, civil aviation officials said that domestic and
international flights, which were cancelled because of the
fighting, will resume on Tuesday and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, Phnom Penh residents were complaining about serious
law and order problems as robberies were rampant in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Most businesses kept their doors shut and civilians stayed at
home. They said they didn't understand why the curfew was lifted
under such a circumstance.

<P>
Security at the Madrid International Airport is tight. Soldiers

HONG KONG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa today called on
the Hong Kong police force to make continued efforts in
maintaining stability and promoting prosperity of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
Tung attended a reception held this evening by the Police Force
Council to celebrate Hong Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
At the reception Tung said that the establishment of the SAR on
July 1 is a historic event of the Chinese nation, and since then
Hong Kong has entered a new era.
</P>
<P>
"The whole team of public servants has transferred to serve the
SAR. We will do our best to serve Hong Kong, to devote to Hong
Kong's continued stability and prosperity," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that, as part of the team of public servants, the Hong
Kong police is a modernized, highly-efficient professional force.
</P>
<P>
"The high-quality service of the police force has not only been
praised by Hong Kong residents, but also won fairly high fame in
the world. It is one of the world's best police teams," he said.
</P>
<P>
He highly praised and expressed sincere thanks to the police

BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- China's local departments in charge
of grain purchasing have been asked to do their best to protect
farmers' enthusiasm for selling summer grain nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Internal Trade and the State Grain Reserve
Administration jointly issued a circular today, encouraging the
departments to play a leading role in purchasing summer grain. A
big summer grain harvest has been registered in most parts of
China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more channels should be opened in order to ensure
the purchase of grain beyond the quota, the circular stipulated,
adding that a standard price should be adhered to, so that
farmers' interests can be protected.
</P>
<P>
The circular also asked the departments to publicize state
policies widely, as well as improve their service, in a bid to
encourage farmers to sell more grain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the departments should guarantee the quality of
grain as well as transportation and storage work, it added.

SARAJEVO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Mate Boban, the leader of the now

in early Monday, a Sarajevan news agency reported.

Boban was the president of the Croat statelet in 1993 when
Croats fought with their former Muslim allies and was reportedly
responsible for ethnic cleansing in the part of Bosnia under Croat
control.
</P>
<P>
Boban stepped down before Croats and Muslims agreed to forming
a federation in 1994 and the so called Republic of Herceg-Bosna
has then been replaced by the Croat Community of Herceg Bosna.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Withdraws Most of Its Troops From Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkey reaffirmed today that it has
withdrawn most of its government troops from northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly news briefing, Foreign Ministry Deputy
Spokesman Sermet Atacanli said that Turkey's major objective in
military operation in the region has been achieved in large
scale.
</P>
<P>
He said that the General Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces has
ordered return of most its troops, leaving a small contingent
there to monitor peace.
</P>
<P>
Around 50,000-strong Turkish government troops launched a
massive military incursion into northern Iraq on May 14 to wipe
out the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) rebels there.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Turkey has a plan to establish a "buffer zone" in
this region to ensure its border security, Atacanli said that no
concrete decision has been made in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Strategists here noted that one of Turkey's objectives to begin
the massive campaign is to establish a "buffer zone" in a bid to
effectively curb the PKK rebels, which are termed as the most
dangerous threat to Turkey's border security.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi diplomatic sources here told Xinhua that the Turkish
government had asked the Iraqi government to allow Turkey to set
up a "buffer zone" on the Iraqi territory, but Iraq rejected the
request.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's military operation in northern Iraq has drawn sharp
criticism from the Arab world and some Western countries as well,
which demand an early pull-out of Turkish troops from the region.
</P>
<P>
The PKK rebels have been fighting a separatist war in
southeastern and eastern Turkey since 1984 in an attempt to
establish an independent Kurdish state.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of China's
National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, voiced his
belief today that Sino-Bolivian friendly cooperative ties would be
further promoted on the existing basis.
</P>
<P>
Meeting here today with Raul Lema Patino, president of the
Senate of the National Congress of Bolivia, Qiao said that the
relations between China and Bolivia "have always been good," and
that the NPC would make joint efforts with the Bolivian National
Congress to increase bilateral cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
Lema told Qiao that he was pleased to have the chance to see
the prosperous economic growth in China soon after the return of
Hong Kong to the motherland. He said that former Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping is globally respected not only because of his
dedication to the settlement of the Hong Kong issue, but also
because of his contributions to China's remarkable reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that it was the great concept of "one country, two
systems" devised by Deng Xiaoping that enabled Hong Kong to return
smoothly to the motherland. The concept will also play an
important role in China's reunification, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lema said that he had held important working talks with NPC
Vice-Chairman Buhe this afternoon, which made his delegation
better acquainted with the NPC and its standing committee. It is
of great importance for Bolivia and China to boost their
relations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also briefed the Bolivian visitors on China's economic
growth. China is a developing country as well as the most populous
country in the world, Qiao went on to say, adding that China has
achieved rapid economic growth over the past decades, but it still
needs long-term efforts for it to become a developed country.
</P>
<P>
Lema and his party arrived here Sunday on a goodwill visit as
guests of the NPC Standing Committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today urged Cambodian
leaders to address all their differences through dialogue and
settle problems by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was contained in a statement issued here by
Malaysia's Acting Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia considers the continuing peace and stability of
Cambodia as extremely important, both as a country having close
relations with Malaysia and as a country soon to be a member of
ASEAN," Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, along with Laos and Myanmar, is scheduled to join
Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand
and Vietnam later this month as a member of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Anwar said Malaysia called upon Cambodia's co-prime ministers
Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen in particular to bring an
immediate stop to the fighting and cease all provocative actions.
</P>
<P>
"The Government of Malaysia is especially concerned about the
safety and well-being of Malaysians working in Cambodia or
visiting the country at this time," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said the Malaysian
embassy in Phnom Penh had drawn up a contingency plan to deal with
the situation there, which includes evacuation of all Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
"We are continuously monitoring the situation," the spokesman
said, noting that there are up to 500 Malaysians in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the Cambodian capital has been under Hun Sen's
control after two days of fighting between his forces and those
loyal to Ranariddh, in which at least 10 people were killed and
more than 50 others injured.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets US Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), met a delegation from the US Committee of One
Hundred in the Great Hall of the People here today.
</P>
<P>
Li welcomed the US visitors led by the committee's President
Chang-lin Tien and Governor Henry Tang to visit China during the
period immediately after the return of Hong Kong to the motherland
on July 1.
</P>
<P>
He said that the return of Hong Kong is a great event of
profound significance in China's modern history. All Chinese
people, wherever they live, are delighted from the bottom of their
hearts.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the stable transition of Hong Kong should
be attributed to the great idea of "one country, two systems."
This idea reflects the talented political wisdom of Deng Xiaoping
and the Chinese people's characteristic of open-mindedness, as
well as a result of the progress of human civilization.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that, following the experience of the smooth return
of Hong Kong, we will find even more satisfactory resolutions for
the issues of Macao and Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-US relations, Li said that, generally speaking,
bilateral relations have been moving ahead amid twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that because of different historical
backgrounds, social systems and ideologies, and other reasons, it
is normal for the two countries to have some differences.
</P>
<P>
However, it is important for the two sides to seek more
opportunities and adopt more ways to create a sound atmosphere for
stepping up contacts and exchanges, so as to increase
understanding and eliminate misunderstanding, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said he is optimistic about the future of Sino-US ties,
noting that developing sound bilateral relations is a historic
trend that can not be diverted by the will of any individual.
</P>
<P>
This also accords with the aspirations of the people of both
countries and the interests of all other countries, Li added,
expressing appreciation for the committee's efforts in advancing
Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
In response, Tien said that people all over the world,
including overseas Chinese and people of Chinese origin, are all
excited over the return of Hong Kong. He also said that Deng's
concept of "one country, two systems" was a great creation.
</P>
<P>
The Committee of One Hundred, as a non-governmental
organization representing Chinese Americans, is keen to contribute
to the promotion of contacts across the Taiwan Straits and the
development of China-US relations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The committee, established in New York in 1991, consists of
outstanding Chinese Americans from all walks of life.
</P>
<P>
The 28-member delegation is here at the invitation of the CPPCC
National. Wang Guangying, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee
of the Chinese National People's Congress, met with the delegation
earlier today.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab
Chaiyasarn today said that his country was ready to shelter
Cambodian civilians fleeing the fightings in their home country.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has been well recognized by the international
community for its role in providing humanitarian assistance to
Indochinese refugees in the past, Prachuab told a local radio.
</P>
<P>
During the 20 years of the Cold War era, Thailand provided
shelters for a total of 2 million Indochinese refugees, he noted.
</P>
<P>
It would continue to assume such a role in the case that the
current situation in Cambodia escalates, the minister was quoted
as saying by the Thai News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"I am not worried about new influxes of Cambodian refugees but
I can't help feeling sorry for the plights that people in our
neighboring country will have to endure again," Prachuab said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand considers the recent fighting in Phnom Penh internal
affairs of Cambodia, he said, adding that he hoped Cambodian
leaders would be able to solve their differences peacefully.

friendly relations with Japan has always been regarded as an
important part of the Chinese government's national policies.
</P>
<P>
Qiao is also a member of the politburo of the Central Committee

to the delegation, led by the Sun Party's president Tsutomu Hata.
</P>
<P>
He reviewed the development of bilateral relations since the
normalization of diplomatic relations 25 years ago, saying that
present Sino-Japanese relations have not been achieved easily and
should be treasured by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two countries should, with due regard to
history, look to the future and increase their friendship and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the statesmen of the two countries could
handle all the contradictions and differences from a long-standing
and strategic perspective, in order to bring sound bilateral
relations into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Hata said that the purpose of the delegation's China visit is
to discuss Japanese-Chinese relations into the next century
through exchanges between his party and the CPC.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the development of bilateral friendly relations
will not only be significant for the two countries and peoples,
but will also benefit peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific
region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He added that his party is willing to contribute to the healthy
development of bilateral relations, and to peace, stability and
development in Asia and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese visitors arrived here earlier today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Communist Party Gaining More Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Communism retains its attraction in
China, so much so that you can find one Party member for every 20
Chinese nowadays.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics from the Organization Department of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee show that the
Party now boasts 58 million members, an increase of 9.92 million
over five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Party has reinforced its organization work following the
decision at its 14th national congress in 1992 to further
concentrate on economic construction.
</P>
<P>
It rectified and restored grassroots units across the country,
especially those in rural areas, which were rather weak or even
non-functional.
</P>
<P>
Party members are expected to play leading roles in every
aspect of life in China.
</P>
<P>
Some 43.4 percent of the 52 million Party members have an
educational background above senior high school level, and 20.1
percent are women, the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The Party is also becoming younger, as 22.4 percent of its
members are under the age of 35. The Communist Youth League
recommends its active elements for Party membership.
</P>
<P>
While the Party endeavors to expand its membership, it makes
special efforts to ensure the quality of its new blood, officials
with the Party's Organization Department noted.

<HEADLINE> Iran Attacks US for Resuming Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran today voiced its strong
opposition to the recent U.S. resumption of nuclear tests,
alleging that the tests are in violation of the internationally
approved nuclear test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Atomic Energy Organization (IAEO) expressed, in a
letter sent to secretary general of the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) Hans Blix today, its deep concern for the
clear violation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
IAEO president, Reza Amrollahi, noted that the U.S. government
has used a technical loophole in the CTBT to conduct the July 2
nuclear test.
</P>
<P>
Amrollahi said that since the recent test, and also another
one planned for later this year and four more in 1988, are all
designed to improve and maintain the nuclear-weapons arsenal of
the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"It is undoubtedly in clear violation of the spirit of the
treaty," he was quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The IAEO official noted that the nuclear test conducted by the
U.S. government, and the series of other nuclear tests planned
for the near future, clearly shows that the U.S. intends not only
to maintain its nuclear weapons arsenal but is also seeking to
improve their performance.
</P>
<P>
He said that nuclear-weapons tests of the U.S. government
show well that the terms of the CTBT are highly biased in favor
of the nuclear-weapons states and play no effective role in the
elimination of nuclear weapons which was supposed to be the
ultimate goal of the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Iranian government would like to express
its concern about the irresponsible actions of the U.S. which
would undoubtedly undermine the spirit and effectiveness of the
CTBT, thus paving the way for some non-nuclear weapon states to
digress from their commitments under the terms of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
"Iran conveyed its concerns in that respect to the IAEA and
hopes that through a concerned international effort further
violations of the CTBT could be prevented," he added.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and the U.S. are signatories of the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NNPT), but Washington is opposed to
Iran's nuclear power program, claiming that Tehran is seeking to
build nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Amrollahi said today that Iran's nuclear centers were geared
toward peaceful utilization of the atomic energy.
</P>
<P>
"All of Iran's nuclear activities are peaceful. Soon (with
the completion of) the first phase of the atomic power plant in
Bushehr, we will be producing 1,000 megawatts of electricity," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Under a one-billion-U.S. dollar contract signed on January 8,
1995, Russia experts are now helping Iran to complete the
construction, in the port city of Bushehr at the coast of the
northern Gulf, of the nuclear power plant that is expected to
operate in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Russia and Iran signed an accord on control and
safety procedures for a Russian-built nuclear reactor at
Bushehr.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Health Department has
sent additional medical personnel to help the evacuees in the
southern province of Cotabato in Mindanao, health officials said

<HEADLINE> Macao Papers Warn Public of Rising Japanese Militarism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Major newspapers in Macao today
warned the public against the danger of rising Japanese militarism
on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the "July 7th
Incident."
</P>
<P>
Sixty years ago on this day, Japanese troops provoked the
so-called "Lugouqiao (Marco Polo Bridge) Incident" in southwest
Beijing, following its occupation of northeast China. The incident
touched off the eight-year-long Chinese people's "War of
Resistance Against Japan".
</P>
<P>
"When a country is weak and backward, it is vulnerable," says
a commentary in the Macao Daily News. "All the Chinese people
should work hard and be united to make their country strong."
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that some people in Japan are reluctant to face
history, and they are trying to distort its history of invasion.
"We should not sit back and relax since the Japanese militarism is
to start something again."
</P>
<P>
The "Tai Chung Pou" newspaper said that for the people in the
Asia-pacific region to live happily and for the long-term
stability in the region, the danger of rising Japanese militarism
should be made known to all in the region, including the Japanese
people.
</P>
<P>
"We must be vigilante against Japanese militarism so as to
avoid potential danger in the future," said the newspaper in a
commentary.
</P>
<P>
The Cheng Pou newspaper, the Si Man Pou and several other
Chinese newspapers in the territory also warned people of the
danger of Japanese militarism.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Women Have More Twins, Triplets: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian women have more twins and
triplets than their counterparts in other parts of the world,
according to an expert.
</P>
<P>
"Nigerian women have the highest rate of twinning in the
world, 45 in every 1,000 while European women have five per
1,000," said Professor S.E. Okonofua, executive director of the
Woman's Health and Action Research Center (WHARC).
</P>
<P>
The cause of the high rate of twins is not yet known at
present, the expert admitted.
</P>
<P>
"Some say it is due to diet, high consumption of yam and our
center will be coming out with a program soon to know whether
genetics have a role in it," the WHARC chief said.
</P>
<P>
"We also want to to find out whether it is inherited because
there are animals which have such tendencies," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on women with twins to report with them at WHARC's
office in Benin, southern Nigeria's Edo state.
</P>
<P>
WHARC is a registered non-profit organization committed to the
promotion of women's reproductive health in sub-Sahara Africa,
funded by Ford Foundation of the United States.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes 35 Tonnes of Narcotics in 3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 35 tons of narcotics were
seized by Iranian armed police in the first three months of the
current Iranian calendar year starting from March 21, 1997, a
press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Salam reported that the figure shows an
increase of 50 percent in comparison with the drug haul a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
"In the past 45 days, we were able to seize 1.5 tonnes of
morphine in the northwestern province of East Azerbaijan and 300
kilograms of morphine in the northeastern province of Khorssan,"
Mohsen Ansari, deputy chief of the Law Enforcement Forces, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iranian armed police intercepted and confiscated 191 tons of
narcotics from drug dealers during the past Iranian calendar year
ending on March 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Iran is used as a transit route by smugglers for shipping
narcotics produced in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities claimed that some 6,000 tons of opium are
produced in Afghanistan each year. Drug dealers try to smuggle
narcotics through Iran to Turkey where underground labs process
opium and then smuggle heroin into European countries.

<P>
PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's First Prime Minister
Norodom Ranariddh, who is on a private visit to France from
Friday, has decided not to return to Cambodia for the time being,
said Sam Rainsy, chairman of Cambodia's Khmer Nation party.
</P>
<P>
He took the decision on Sunday, said Rainsy who is one of the
opposition leaders allied with Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party.
</P>
<P>
Rainsy told the Agence France-Presse Ranariddh will begin this
week "an international round" of trip in Europe and the United
States to seek support.
</P>
<P>
He will be in Paris today to try to meet with French government
officials in Paris today, said Rainsy.

<P>
Cambodia's Second Prime Minister Hun Sen announced on Sunday
that the government has controlled the situation in Phnom Penh
after two days of fierce fighting in which at least 10 people were
killed and 50 wounded.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Phnom Penh said that fighting erupted again today
between the forces royal to Hun Sen and the guards of Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
The supporters of Ranariddh denied Hun Sen's announcement that
he has put 99 percent of the capital under his control, saying

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Start Anti-Dumping Investigation  on Corrugating Medium Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has decided to
commence an anti-dumping investigation tomorrow on corrugating
medium paper imported from Australia, the European Union, Japan,
South Korea, and some other regions.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken following a petition from the Malaysia
Pulp and Paper Manufacturers Association, alleging that imports of
corrugating medium paper from these countries and regions were
being dumped causing material injury to the country's
related-industry, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
said in a statement issued here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the petition, the alleged product was being sold
in Malaysia at a price much lower than the price at which it is
sold in the exporting countries and regions, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian producers were instead forced to lower their
price in order to compete with the cheaper allegedly dumped
imports and consequently, their profitability was adversely
affected.
</P>
<P>
The Countervailing and Anti-Dumping Duties Act 1993 and its
related regulations provide that a preliminary determination will
be made within 90 days after the investigation is initiated as to
whether there are sufficient grounds for the publication of a
dumping duty notice in respect of the concerned product.
</P>
<P>
If the determination is affirmative, the government may impose
an anti-dumping duty at a level that would eliminate the dumping
which causes material injury or threaten to cause material injury
or retards the growth of the domestic industry producing the like
product.

<HEADLINE> Australian Gold Price Expected To Fall Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The price of gold in Australia
continued its freefall in today's markets, hitting 12-year lows
with analysts predicting there were further falls to come.
</P>
<P>
The fall comes after the Reserve Bank of Australia, the central
bank, announced last Thursday that it had secretively sold
two-thirds (167 tons) of the bank's gold reserves during the past
six months.
</P>
<P>
Australia's gold index in the share markets sank 6.8 percent,
or 93.7 points today at 1275.5 points, that followed Friday's 4.1
percent fall, Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported from
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Market leader, the country's largest gold mining company,
Normandy Mining sank 6.3 percent to 1.32 Australian dollars,
Plutonic slipped 3.9 percent to 3.88 and Newcrest off 5.6 percent
at 3.00 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion was trading in Sydney at 318.25 US dollars per
fine ounce, 6.25 US dollars lower than Friday's close. Falls of
the continuous two sessions have wiped more than 750 million US
dollars off the value of the country's gold companies.
</P>
<P>
"Gold has already reached its lowest levels in more than a
decade, and the worst is not over," some analysts said and they
were predicting the gold price would fall through 300 US dollars
an ounce.
</P>
<P>
In 1985, gold hit a low of 284.75 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gold opened in London tonight at 318.75 to 319.25 US dollar per
ounce, well down on Friday's trading levels of about 324.50 and
the 332 US dollars levels of last Thursday ahead of the latest
slump, according to AAP.
</P>
<P>
Zurich based SBC Warburg dealer Hanspeter Hausheer said, gold
was seen declining further on fears that other countries, New
Zealand for instance, could also decide to sell their gold reserve
to increase fiscal health.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) government has been authorized to
negotiate bilateral agreements with concerned countries in such
fields as air service, investment and law enforcement.

The letter notified that the central people's government has
authorized the HKSAR government to negotiate bilateral agreements
with concerned countries on air service transit, promotion and
protection of investment, return of fugitive offenders, transfer

<HEADLINE> Philippine Finance Chief Denies Report on Peso </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo
today denied earlier reports that he predicted the Philippine peso
will "further devalue" against the U.S. dollar as Thailand's
financial woes spill into the rest of the region.
</P>
<P>
His denial came as the Philippine Central Bank raised again its
overnight borrowing rate to 30 percent from 24 percent due to an
unusual increase in the country's foreign exchange market activity
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Some market analysts attributed the unusual market activity to
the reported De Ocampo's prediction published by a Singapore-based
publication last week.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the Finance Department, De Ocampo
bluntly denied the reports, saying the country's exchange rate is
based on market forces and not determined by the government as
claimed.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo said it is unlikely that the Philippine Central Bank
will allow the peso devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Instead, De Ocampo praised the bank for its prudent foreign
exchange management policy, citing the bank move last week which
raised the interest rates on overnight money as speculators
pounced on the pesos soon after the announcement of the Thailand
baht devaluation.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines will continue its policy of a market-determined
exchange rate and will not resort to any shift in the policy to a
fixed rate system that saw a downfall of the financial system in
Mexico two years ago and in Thailand recently, he said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Manufacturing Output Falls By 1.6% in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's growth in the
manufacturing output continued to slow down in May this year,
declining by 1.6 percent compared to that of May 1996, The
Economic Development Board (EDB) announced today.
</P>
<P>
It said that declines in electronics, machinery and equipment,
transport equipment and fabricated metal products industries
offset the increase in output in the chemical, printing and
publishing and electrical machinery industries.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the cumulative output dropped by 3.3 percent for
the first five months of this year compared to the same period of
1996, the EDB said.
</P>
<P>
In elaboration, the EDB said that output of electronics
products and components declined marginally by 0.1 percent
compared to May last year. This was due to the weak demand and
lower prices of some products, it added.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the output of disk drives and telecommunication
equipment increased. The cumulative output of electronics in the
first five months of 1997 was 5.2 percent lower than the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, cumulative output of the fabricated metal
products, and rubber and plastic products declined by 10.2 percent
and 14.6 percent respectively, while the cumulative output of the
chemical industries grew by 6.7 percent in the first five months
of this year over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The petrochemical industry continued to expand in May with new
capacities. The output increase of 33.6 percent in May brought the
cumulative output growth for the first five months of this year to
32.7 percent, the EDB said.

<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- About one in every two Swedish
voters would be likely to show a cold response to the European
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
The 47 percent disapproval rate against the EMU was suggested
by an opinion poll conducted in March and May, and published today
by the daily newspaper Svenska Dagbladet.
</P>
<P>
The poll indicated that about 29 percent of Sweden's eligible
voters were still undecided about the single currency system,
while 24 percent were in favor of the economic integrity in Europe.
</P>
<P>
As for whether Sweden should join the system scheduled for
official kickoff in 1999, some 54 percent of the Swedish
electorate supported the idea of holding a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Among major Swedish parties, only the Moderate Coalition and
the Liberal Party backed the Nordic country's pursuit of a
membership of the EMU, an establishment of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Early last month, the ruling Social Democrats decided that
Sweden will not be among the first group to join the EMU and a
final decision will be pending the development of the situation.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Elections to Be Put Off Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Liberian presidential and
legislative elections that had been postponed from May 30 to July
19 may be deferred again, the Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian newspaper quoted "a dependable source in Liberia"
as saying that the elections might be shifted due to lack of
funds and the current incessant rains in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's political parties have proposed October as ideal
time for the elections in a letter addressed to General Sani
Abacha, the Nigerian head of state and chairman of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, about 5.4 million U.S. Dollars is
required by the Independent Electoral Commission of Liberia to
conduct the elections.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, less than 1.5 million Dollars has been
realized so far.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS's 16 member countries have agreed to each contribute
110,000 Dollars for the elections, but none of them has fulfilled
their pledges so far, except Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Some presidential candidates were quoted as complaining that
the incessant rains have made it difficult for them to go out on
campaigns, especially in the interior parts of the country where
the roads are in deplorable conditions.
</P>
<P>
The candidates complained that very few of them who are rich
can afford helicopters and powerful jeeps to reach the electorate
in those areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the European Union and the U.S.
are favorably disposed to the October date, but a few candidates
who appear unaffected by the constraints insist on the date of
July 19.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Condemns Use of Children in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The U. N. Children's Fund (UNICEF)
has called on all sides in the Sierra Leonean conflict to stop
using children as combatants and providing for their physical and
emotional welfare in a future peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
In a recent report, UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy
said since the country's May 25 coup, witnesses have reported
seeing hundreds of armed children in the streets of Freetown, the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Many are former child soldiers, who had returned to their
communities during a country-wide demobilization program which
began in 1993, she said, quoted by local newspaper This Day
today.
</P>
<P>
They have now been recruited and re-armed by the ruling Armed
Forces Revolutionary Council and their allies.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, more than 60 percent of 1,000
fighters recently screened by the Disarmament, Remobilization and
Resettlement Unit, set up by the ousted government in the coup,
were women and children.
</P>
<P>
The report put Sierra Leone as a country with one of the
world's worst records for recruiting child soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and 1996, in the previous period of civil unrest
between the government and the rebel Revolutionary United Front,
an estimated 4,500 children were forced to fight on both sides,
it disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Children were abducted and forced to commit atrocities in
order to turn them into ruthless fighters, Bellamy said, adding
that "child soldiers are a symptom of the wider problem, the
complete neglect of a whole generation and every child has felt
the impact of this war, whether or not he or she has been forced
to carry a gun."
</P>
<P>
Young girls, the report went on, have been raped and sexually
abused and many children have been stranded without parents or
relatives.
</P>
<P>
Food distribution has been disrupted and immunization
campaigns halted, leaving children susceptible to epidemics of
typhoid and cholera, it said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Tumbles on Gold's Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A falling gold price caused the
Australian dollar to tumble more than three quarters of a US cent
in today's trade.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed in Sydney at 74.46 US cents from 75.23 on
Friday, hitting its day low of 74.35 US cents this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
With US financial markets shut on Friday for the Independence
Day holiday, activity offshore had been concentrated during
European business hours.
</P>
<P>
Traders said with many market participants in Sydney
long-positioned on the Australian dollar, the dip in the gold
price encouraged players to shorten their positions.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) announcement last week
that it had sold two-thirds of its gold reserves has softened the
price of the precious metal.
</P>
<P>
Gold closed in Sydney at 319.25 US dollars per fine ounce, a
fall of 4.50 US dollars since its close on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Another factor weighing down the unit is the market's
expectation that the RBA will cut interest rates again before the
end of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 83.73 Japanese yen from 85.26
yen on Friday, and at 1.3018 German marks from 1.3167 marks.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Bans Beef Imports from Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has banned the import of beef
from Belgium which reportedly defied a mad cow disease-related ban
and helped smuggling British beef to the Netherlands, Russia and
Egypt, the Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
A statement published by Egypt's Ministry of Supply and Trade
said the ban took effect last Thursday following the European
Commission's announcement that 1,600 tonnes of British beef had
been smuggled into the three countries from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the European Commission, 700 tonnes
of the beef had been seized by Dutch authorities and the remaining
900 tonnes had probably been exported to Russia and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Supply and Trade Minister Ahmed Goweili had ordered
tighter control on imported meat to ensure that beef in Egyptian
market was free from the mad cow disease, or Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy.
</P>
<P>
The mad cow disease, which was first spotted in Britain, can be
transmitted to human beings.
</P>
<P>
Goweili said Saturday that he decided to follow up
interrogations with some Belgian exporters who are suspected of
exporting contaminated meat from Britain to world markets.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Egypt has a ban already in place on
importing all kinds of meat slain in Britain and all live animals
from five European states, namely Britain, France, Spain,
Switzerland and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
"Any shipment entering Egypt should have a certificate of
origin from the exporting countries and endorsed by the Egyptian
embassies there," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has imported 32,000 live cows from Australia, 250,000
tonnes of camel meat from New Zealand since January.

NEW DELHI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government may go for

all hazardous or non-hazardous industries and occupations, Indian
Minister of State for Labor Veerendra Kumar said here today.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a two-day conference of labor ministers of state

The minister of state urged the participants to take a decision
as to whether the country should go in for an altogether new law
prohibiting employment of child labor in all employment, hazardous
or non-hazardous.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important matter on which we need to obtain a
consensus from the state or union territory governments across the
country," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Banning Tree-cutting To Fight Desertification in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- In yet another move to halt
desertification in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the
government has outlawed the cutting of trees and has put desert
plants like diversiform-leaf poplar and other trees under strict
protection.
</P>
<P>
The small mills that use trees as raw materials will be
gradually closed as well, according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
The region is the largest Chinese provincial area and also the
driest one, with a fourth of its area covered by sand. Its 3.8
million hectares of forest are shrinking rapidly as farmers cut
trees for firewood.
</P>
<P>
As a result, sand is encroaching on 350 square kilometers of
land each year, something that has caused concern among local
environmental protection authorities.
</P>
<P>
The official said they will popularize the use of marsh gas,
sunlight, and wind as energy sources to replace the use of
firewood in most farm houses and the local government will set up
eight check stations in forest areas to prevent trees from being
cut.
</P>
<P>
The region's growing petroleum and natural gas industry will
also provide a new energy source so that wood will eventually stop
being used for fuel by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Water resources are another priority item. The local government
will set limits on the amount of water used by industries to
ensure that desert plants and forests get sufficient amounts of
water.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania To Produce Weevil Insects Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has planed mass
production of weevil (Kidung'ata) insects in 1997/98 to fight
cassava diseases in the country.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Agriculture and Cooperatives Paul Kimiti made
this disclosure in Dodoma, central Tanzania at the weekend,
saying that the insects would be distributed in Mwanza, Mtwara,
Lindi and Morogoro regions.
</P>
<P>
Kimiti added that a quarantine on importation and
transportation of plants would be intensified in selected centers
as provided under the New Plants Conservation and Crop Protection
Act.
</P>
<P>
He named the centers as the Dar es Salaam and Kilimanjaro
International Airports, and ports of Tanga, Dar es Salaam,
Mtwara, lake Victoria, Tanganyika and Nyasa, as well as centers
located in all national borders.
</P>
<P>
The minister further said rodents control campaigns would also
be strengthened in 230 out of 362 remaining villages in Lindi
Region as part of controlling crop destruction.
</P>
<P>
He noted that swamps of grass hoppers continued to be a
headache, so his ministry was building its capacity to contain
the destructivers hoppers in some areas through procurement of
essential equipment.
</P>
<P>
"This time our research will focus more on solving the
peasant's basic production problems and not on the interest of
researchersrs," Kimit said.
</P>
<P>
He would put more emphasis on researching quality food and
cash crops seeds, modern farming techniques and cheap methods of
containing crop diseases.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Raises Borrowing Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- To counter speculations against the
Philippine peso, the Philippine Central Bank today increased its
overnight borrowing rate to 30 percent from 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said in a statement that
the action stemmed from a "sharp and unusual" increase in foreign
exchange market activity this morning.
</P>
<P>
Some market speculators attributed the increase in foreign
exchange market to a news item in Singapore last week that the
peso will suffer further devaluation.
</P>
<P>
The said news item was believed to have been quoted from the
country's finance official that the bank had no choice but to
raise its borrowing rate to safely absorb the market shocks.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the news item, Singson said that the country's
exchange rate policy remains unchanged, adding that the exchange
rate will not be administratively fixed.
</P>
<P>
Instead, he said, it shall be determined through transactions
in the foreign exchange market on a day-to-day basis, noting that
while Thailand floated the baht only last week, the Philippine
peso has been under a floating rate system for the past 27 years.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized, however, that the authorities will intervene in
the market to compensate for excessive fluctuations and to counter
speculative attack on the peso.
</P>
<P>
Singson also said that the bank can use foreign exchange sales
and higher interest rates to stabilize "erratic movements" in the
exchange rate, adding that today's action is necessary,
particularly if the local currency comes under speculative
pressures.

Cambodia's First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh and those of
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen in Phnom Penh. While the troops of
Hun Sen seemed to have put the capital under their control, the

has taken control of the strategic Number Five Road which links
Battambang, Cambodia's second largest city, with Thailand.

partisans to launch a "profound debate" to "find the necessary
synthesis between the demand for competitiveness, the need for
solidarity and the preservation of the identity of France."

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Launch Second Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines will launch the
second satellite before the year-end, the official Philippine News
Agency said today.
</P>
<P>
The Satellite, Agila II, is now completed at the Space Systems
Loral plant in Palo Alto, California, where it was manufactured,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
Owned by the Mabuhay Philippines Satellite Corporation (MPSC),
a local consortium led by the Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Company (PLDT), the 200-million-U.S.-dollar satellite will shortly
undergo final tests to prepare for its scheduled launch.
</P>
<P>
MPSC President Oscar Reyes was quoted as saying Agila II will
replace Agila I, at the 144-degree east orbital slot. Agila I is
an interim satellite launched last year in time to provide
transmission services for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) meeting held in Manila and Subic last November.
</P>
<P>
Agila I will give way to the more powerful Agila II and will
start moving out of the orbital site later this month or early
August, Reyes said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Agila II will have 10 kilowatts of power at the outset with 54
active C-band and Ku-band transponders.
</P>
<P>
Prior to having their own satellite, Philippines
telecommunications and broadcast firms used to rent the services
of the Indonesian Palapa satellite.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ruling Party Urges Help for Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu (PF) is
deeply worried about growing poverty among the poor despite its
rapid economy growth.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting held last week, private and government economists
have been trumpeting economic growth, with even the World Bank
happy about reforms and the economy in general.
</P>
<P>
But this growth means very little if the people as a whole do
not feel they are better off and if the benefits do not reach the
majority, the Herald paper today quoted Zanu (PF) vips as saying
at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Few opportunities have been opened for the poor, the party's
politburo agreed in its critical analysis.
</P>
<P>
So the party is to launch a new drive to help the poor in the
country, as reported by the national major newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The party's economic, production and labor departments will be
taking the leading role, working with relevant government
ministries and departments, to ensure that all benefit from the
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Special concern was the plight of the rural poor. Driven by
poverty, people are moving into the towns and cities hoping to
find work, yet finding themselves in even worse conditions when
they arrived.

<HEADLINE> IMF Withholds $37m Loan to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has withheld a 37 million U.S. Dollars loan to Kenya
because of the High Court's termination of the Goldenberg case,
The East African reported today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly paper quoted A. Basu, IMF Deputy Director of the
Africa Department, as saying in Washington that the Kenya's loan
request had not been taken to the Board of Directors as scheduled
on June 26 because the IMF was "baffled" by the High Court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
He announced that a team led by Hiroyuki Hino, Assistant
Director of the Africa Department, will return to Nairobi this
week to seek a clarification from the Kenyan government.
</P>
<P>
On June 20, a two-judge bench ruled against further action in
the 105 million Dollars Goldenberg fraud case involving
millionaire businessman Kamlesh Pattni and former senior
government officials.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government had been expecting the release of the
second instalment of the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF) following a visit by an IMF mission last April.
</P>
<P>
The timetable of the second instalment officially ran out on
June 30, Basu said, adding that "we have now extended the ESAF
arrangement to the end of July to give the (Kenyan) government
time to say what it will do in the matter."
</P>
<P>
When the three-year 220 million Dollars ESAF loan agreement
was signed in April 1995, the understanding was that the Kenyan
government remain committed to good financial housekeeping which
included actions to reduce or eliminate corruption in the public
sector.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides for loan disbursement in six equal
instalments, but before each is released, the IMF must be
satisfied that the government has fulfilled the conditions agreed
upon during negotiations.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Spends $20m on Olympics Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Cape Town 2004
Olympic Bid Committee has invested 86 million Rand (19 million
U.S. dollars) to build or improve facilities that will be used if
the city wins the bid to host the Games.
</P>
<P>
The facilities include a boxing arena and a number of
multipurpose centers around Cape Town, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
Michael Fuller, Director of Finance of the Cape Town Olympic
Bid Committee, said they had been given a 95,000 Rand (21,111
U.S. Dollars) budget. It will be utilized until September 5 when
the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announces which city
that will host the 2004 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Bid budget covers salaries, technical teams,
travel, marketing and administration. Funding for the bid process
comes entirely from the private sector and no ratepayers' money
is used in the bid phase, Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
Although there is only about two months left before IOC made
final announcement of the Olympics host city, the South African
side is still trying to bring over IOC members to brief them on
Cape Town's bid, Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
About 91,000 permanent jobs will be created between 1997 and
2006 if Cape twon's bid proves to be successful, officials
concerned said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Cape Town, the other four cities in the running to
host the 2004 Olympics are Rome, Stockholm, Buenos Aires and
Athens.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged To Stop Taking New Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- African countries should
stop taking new loans, and instead concentrate on production to
avert the total collapse of their economies.
</P>
<P>
This urgement was made at the weeked in Zanzibar by
participants at the on-going International Conference on
Democracy and Development.
</P>
<P>
Among the participants were members of parliament, leaders of
political parties and research institutions.
</P>
<P>
The participants pointed out that the current level of the
debt burden most African countries have was due to the fact that
they failed to repay them.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that African countries should discuss with
their creditors and find possible ways to write off the debts,
thus enabling them to concentrate on production and export.
The three-day conference is expected to close today.

<HEADLINE> Iran Threatens to Mine Iranian-Afghan Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian security chief has
warned that Iran will mine its border areas linking Afghanistan
to fight the outlawed and drugs traffickers if needed, a press
report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Tehran Times reported that a
special council on eastern border security has been formed at
the Iranian Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The council comprises the interior minister, provincial
governors from bordering three provinces, the commander of the
Law Enforcement Forces and the intelligence departments.
</P>
<P>
"All means of protecting borders, including barbed wire,
digging trenches, and if necessary, mining the eastern border
areas in combating outlaws and narcotics traffickers have
either been implemented or discussed," Interior Minister Ali
Mohammed Besharati was quoted by the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking has been a serious problem for the Iranian
government since the country is considered by drug smugglers as
one of the main transit route for narcotics produced in the
"golden crescent", an area along Afghan-Pakistani borders.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Besharati made the statement at a meeting
of the council Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister said that his ministry is responsible
for protecting the nation's borders and enjoys widespread
support from the Law Enforcement Forces, militia of the country
and provincial authorities in eastern provinces in insuring
security for the border areas.
</P>
<P>
He added that in confronting narcotics traffickers, all
security forces have joined hands, and taken measures to insure
success in most areas as far as security is concerned.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report, Iran has closed its border
with Afghan province of Herat, imposing a complete ban on travel
and trade convoys.
</P>
<P>
The Islam Qila border linking Iran with the trading center
Herat, which is held by the Afghan Taliban militia, was sealed in
mid-June.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that up to 1,000 people crossed the border
city daily and the Taliban earned tens of thousands of
U.S. dollars through customs duty on the transit trade which
included electronics products as well as new or reconditioned
Japanese cars arriving from Dubai of the United Arab Emirates and
other Gulf states via Islam Qila.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban spokesman "strongly condemned" the Iranian move
and claimed the ban on transit trade and travel as another
expression of "Iranian hostility toward Afghanistan," according
to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Iran is opposed to the hardline Taliban militia which has
controlled two-thirds of Afghan territory since it captured the
capital city of Kabul and ousted the pro-Tehran government of
former president Burhanuddin Rabbani in last September.
</P>
<P>
Iran, fearing Taliban influence, still considers Rabbani's
government as legitimate.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia's space cargo ship M-35
successfully docked with Mir space station today, with repair
parts needed to bring the aging spacecraft back to full power.
</P>
<P>
Mir was slightly damaged on June 25, when it collided with a
previous cargo ship in a docking attempt. The cargo ship poked a
small hole in Mir's Spektr module.
</P>
<P>
The space station has been running on reduced power and the
Spektr module sealed off from the rest of the spacecraft since the
accident.
</P>
<P>
The Progress M-35 cargo ship today brought to Mir about two
tons of supplies, including custom-made repair parts to help
restore power supply to the space station.
</P>
<P>
At Mission Control just outside Moscow, flight controllers
watched on a giant television screen as Mir and the cargo ship
made a successful docking 400 kilometers above Siberia at 9:59
a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Two Russian and an American astronauts are working on the
11-year-old space station.

<HEADLINE> NZ Proposes Changes in Superannuation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government
announced today a detailed plan for a new compulsory retirement
savings scheme (RSS) in an effort to reduce the government burden
to fund the present universal superannuation.
</P>
<P>
The plan was announced by Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer
Winston Peters, who masterminded the new scheme. The scheme will
be put to a referendum in September in accordance with an
agreement signed by the National Party and the New Zealand First
party when they formed the coalition last December.
</P>
<P>
Under the new plan, the government wants each of the New
Zealanders to save 120,000 NZ dollars (80,400 US dollars) by the
time they are 65 years old.
</P>
<P>
The plan, if endorsed by the referendum, will go into force on
July 1, 1998, with 3 cents from each dollar deduced from anyone
earning over 5,000 dollars each year. But the amount will
eventually rise to 8 cents.
</P>
<P>
The deduction will apply to all incomes, including bank
interests and dividends.
</P>
<P>
While the RSS target is 120,000 dollars, the document says men
will need to save only 111,000 dollars to purchase a standard
annuity and women need 125,000 dollars because they have a longer
life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
But once they meet the 120,000-dollar target, women can stop
saving and the government will top up their lump sum.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the need for the proposed changes, Prime Minister
Jim Bolger said "many people agree it will be extremely difficult
or impossible to sustain the present scheme into the middle of the
next century."
</P>
<P>
He said that "the cost of New Zealand Superannuation is
projected to double from 5 percent to over 10 percent of GDP by
the middle of next century."

<HEADLINE> Thai Planes on Standby to Evacuate Thais from Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has placed four C-130
transport planes on standby to evacuate about 650 Thai nationals
from Phnom Penh as fighting is escalating in the Cambodian capital.
</P>
<P>
The planes had remained grounded as of last night as Thailand
had not received assurance from Cambodian authorities of a safe
landing for the planes and safe passage of the stranded Thais from
downtown Phnom Penh to Pochentong international airport, which is
near the main fighting ground to the west of the capital.
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign embassies in Phnom Penh have requested
permission for their staff to leave the Cambodian capital with the
Thai C-130s.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out on Saturday between troops loyal to First
Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, in his capacity as
Defense Minister, has ordered the country's armed forces, in
particular the army, to apply strict security measures on the
border with Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Thai Armed Forces Information Office,
Lieutenant-General Rattana Chalermsaenyakorn, said armed Cambodian
troops are forbidden to enter the country, but humanitarian help
is to be given to unarmed Cambodians seeking refuge.

<P>
SUZHOU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 caves used for
military purposes, which are 2,500 years old, have been discovered
in Zhangjiagang City in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>

Archaeologists say that they could date back to the Spring and
Autumn Period (770-476 B.C.) and the Warring States Period
(475-221 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
The caves were used as beacon stations to convey military
information. They were discovered on a small hill, which played an
important role in ancient military history.
</P>
<P>
According to the archeologists, the caves are eight to 15
meters deep, and are surrounded by stone walls outside.
</P>
<P>
Many historical relics such as pottery and china were unearthed
in them.

<HEADLINE> Five Lebanese Wounded in Israeli Bombardment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Five Lebanese civilians were wounded
Sunday night by Israeli artillery bombardment at a number of south
Lebanese villages, security sources in south Lebanon said this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli assault came in an apparent retaliation for a
Katyusha rocket attack fired by guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, on the Israeli
self-claimed "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Several rockets suspectedly out of the barrage landed in
northern Israel without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite Muslim Hezbollah announced in a statement that its
fighters fired Katyusha rockets and mortar shells at the Israeli
positions in the "security zone" around 10:00 p.m. Sunday (2100
GMT).
</P>
<P>
The attack caused "serious and precise damages" to the Israeli
positions, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in the border strip said that about seven
Katyusha rockets were fired into northern Israel at 10:20 p.m. and
landed near the Jewish settlement of Naharia.
</P>
<P>
Israeli occupation forces shelled the Zahrani basin, Iglim
Al-Toffah, Kfar Tibnit, Sitt Zbeideh, Al-Wadi Al-Akhdar and the
Litani basin to retaliate the attack, wounding five Lebanese
villagers in Kfar Tibnit, with one of them in serious conditions.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas fired at least two Sam-7 anti-air missiles
at the Israeli helicopters but missed the targets, according to
the security sources.
</P>
<P>
The Beirut government reportedly has filed a complaint, the
second in three days, to the five-nation committee monitoring the
cease-fire between Israel and Lebanon, accusing Israel of
violations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reached a cease-fire understanding in April
1996. Representatives from France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the
United States, who make up the monitoring committee, are to hold a
meeting in the south Lebanese border town of Naqoura this morning
to look into the two Lebanese complaints and another one filed by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Brokered by the United States and France, the cease-fire
understanding bars fighting sides in south Lebanon, which remains
the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict, from
attacking civilian targets or launching operations from civilian
areas.

KAMPALA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Lt. Colonel Nakibus Lakara, the
deputy of the fourth division commander, is now in the United
States for one-year training there, ''The New Vision'' disclosed
today.
</P>
<P>

<P>
MANILA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) bombed with mortars military installations
in central Mindanao, the southern Philippines, early today, the
military said.
</P>
<P>
Capt. Noel Detoyato, spokesman for the Sixth Infantry Division,
said MILF guerrillas unleashed some 10 projectiles at several Army
detachments in Rajah Mudah village, Pikit town in Cotabato, around
5:00 am today but hit nothing.
</P>
<P>
The latest MILF attack in Rajah Mudah, a former rebel
stronghold seized by the military last month, is a move by the
Moro front to retake the place after being overran by government
forces late last month, Detoyato said.
</P>
<P>
Detoyato said government forces stationed in Rajah Mudah were
ordered to maintain a defensive posture.
</P>
<P>
The attack came two days after government troops and MILF
rebels engaged in a day-long encounter in certain areas in the
provinces of Maguindanao and Cotabato.
</P>
<P>
The encounter killed 23 rebels, soldiers and civilians and
resulted in the evacuation of thousands of civilians.

<HEADLINE> Underground Water Level Restored in China's Scenic West Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The subterranean water level
around China's West lake has returned to 1.8 meters deep, compared
with more than 30 meters deep last year.
</P>
<P>
A study indicates that the sharp drop in the water table around
the West Lake, which is a famous scenic spot in Hangzhou, capital
of east China's Zhejiang Province, was because of a long period of
drought and the over-exploitation of underground water, which even
led to ground subsidence in some areas.
</P>
<P>
To protect the water resources, city departments have placed
strict restrictions on the exploitation of underground water since
1984.
</P>
<P>
The number of water wells decreased from 80 in 1991 to 50 in
1994. Ten deep-water wells around the West lake were ordered
closed last year, and inspections have been conducted to maintain
controls on the wells.
</P>
<P>
No ground subsidence was reported in Hangzhou last year.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Does Kenya Need to Be Ordered About </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- While colonialists tasted the
bitter fruits of their failure in the surge of freedom and
national independence over three decades ago, some westerners are
staging a comeback; this time they are offering "freedom and
democracy".
</P>
<P>
Western donor countries through eight senior diplomats based
here have urged the Kenyan government to hold talks with
Opposition or civil leaders about constitutional reforms before
the impending general elections, saying the government should
"meet the needs of Kenyans."
</P>
<P>
For this President Daniel arap Moi on Sunday rapped the
foreigners for colluding with Opposition politicians to
destabilize Kenya through chaos and illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Far from offering aid for the underdeveloped African country's
economic construction and well-wished suggestions in running the
society, some westerners have been funding so-called civilian
education and democracy institutions, which are trying hard "to
jeopardize the hard-won stability and order in the society".
</P>
<P>
While the government showed their restraints against several
unauthorized gatherings and dispersed a few chaos that had
brought personnel injuries and property destruction, a delegation
from the Amnesty International cropped up in Nairobi last month
with the task "to find facts" on Kenya's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
What's absurd is that well before the delegation had started
their "fact-finding" mission, the visiting Secretary-General
Pierre Sane of Amnesty International seemed to have reached
conclusion before hand.
</P>
<P>
In an address delivered in Nairobi, he asserted that Kenya
should have an all-round reform in its institutional, judicial
and administrative systems.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that his investigation was based on the
"representative classes of the society", adding, "their concerns
about Kenya is just what most Kenyans are concerning about."
</P>
<P>
"It is a sheer lie," retorted the Kenyan government in a
statement on June 11. It said if an investigation had been
undertaken with most Kenyans, people would have found that what
Kenyans really care "is poverty, housing, education, security and
health service", and not what the Amnesty Internatinal's
so-called human rights.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, Kenya Times, a local daily, said that Amnesty
International could hardly be trusted as it had taken sides in
Kenya's political affairs.
</P>
<P>
"While hundreds of thousands of innocent people were
slaughtered in Rwanda, Amnesty International was busy searching
for non-existent 'evidence' of human rights abuses in peaceful
Kenya." the commentary complained.
</P>
<P>
Along with the Amnesty International, some western diplomats
in Nairobi have been showing unprecedented concerns over the
elections in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
On April 11, 14 West embassies including the U.K. and the U.S.
issued a joint statement, "deploring" Kenyan police actions
against the Opposition parties' unauthorized rallies and pressing
the government to give explanation.
</P>
<P>
The statement handed out by U.S. embassy said political
leaders and candidates of all parties "must be accorded the
opportunity to give te necessary information to their electorate
to enable them to make choices when they exercise their rights to
vote."
</P>
<P>
To this, Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka gave a
resounding answer, saying it was normal practice for foreign
embassies to raise their concerns with the government, but going
public with the concerns amounted to a challenge to Kenya's
sovereignty and "Kenya cannot be seen to compromise on national
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
He asked the British High Commissioner: could there be a rally
without the government's permission in Britain? If not, why did
the Western diplomats demand such an exception from the Kenyan
government while no other government in the world would find it
bearable?
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan minister said his government did not like to see
Western embassies to return to the confrontational style of
former U.S. Ambassador Smith Hempstone before Kenya's first
multi-party elections in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan paper put it right when it said: these westerners
are using "human rights" and "democracy" to push Kenya into chaos
just like what has happened in Somalia, Liberia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
A democratic election is underway with over nine million
people having registered to vote later this year in Kenya.
Observers here say what Kenya really needs is aid in the
country's economic construction and well-wishers' constructive
suggestions, not in any way prescriptions calculated to incite
Kenyans against their government, and practices that often remind
Kenyans and other African peoples of the dark colonial days.

<HEADLINE> South China's Success in Preventing Desertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- South China's island province of
Hainan has set up more than 1,000 km of shelter-belt forests along
the coast in the past four decades, and has successfully stopped
the encroaching sand.
</P>
<P>
Hainan is surrounded by sea, and most of its coastal areas are
threatened by desertification. In the early 1950s, the island had
more than 40,000 hectares of drifting sand that moved inland at a
speed of eight to 12 meters annually. A large amount of farmland
and a number of villages were destroyed in the process.
</P>
<P>
The province has planted 60,000 hectares of forest along the
coast in the past 40 years, and seven million hectares of farmland
have been protected as a result, as well as the lives of more than
1.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
The province is placing priority in science and technology in
the afforestation efforts and plans to make the public more aware
of the work and to increase spending on it.

<HEADLINE> Israel may Buy Airbus instead of Boeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Israel is interested in
purchasing five aircraft from the Airbus, in a deal that would
cost more than 200 million U.S. dollars, reported The Jerusalem
Post newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from Airbus, the European consortium, is due to
arrive in Israel today to discuss with representatives of EL AL,
Israel's national carrier.
</P>
<P>
The talks are significant both because they signal a possible
break in the airline's traditional link with Boeing as a supplier
of aircraft and because this is part of EL AL's new plan to
concentrate on equipping itself with a fleet of smaller aircraft
capable of making long-range flights.
</P>
<P>
With the smaller aircraft, the company would be able to make
direct flights to long-range destinations without the need to
pick up or drop off additional passengers on the way. It could
also increase the number of flights to each destination.
</P>
<P>
EL AL spokesman Nachman Kleiman said that his company intends
to buy five aircraft each capable of carrying between 125-150
passengers.
</P>
<P>
Airbus is offering its A319 and A320 models to replace EL
AL's Boeing 737-200 aircraft. Kleiman said that the deal, if
concluded, would cost "well over 200 million dollars."
</P>
<P>
EL AL has had an all-Boeing fleet since 1961. In 1979, the
airline thought of purchasing an Airbus airplane but gave up the
idea after considerable political pressure from the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
The EL AL Director General, Yoel Feldschuh, said that a
connection with a firm other than Boeing would only be
economically feasible if EL AL bought several aircraft from the
other supplier so that it could maintain a supply of spare
parts.
</P>
<P>
Both Feldschuh and Board Chairman Yosef Ciechanover met with
senior officials of Airbus, as well as Boeing, at the Paris Air
Show two weeks ago and discussed the possibility of acquiring
aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Consumption Structure of Shandong's Urban Residents To Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A recent provincial government study
in east China's Shandong Province seems to indicate that people in
towns and cities there will spend less on food, but more on
housing, transport, telecommunications, and education in the years
to come.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, expenditures for food will continue to
shrink in spite of the fact that some healthier food with higher
nutritional value and lower in fat will become popular as will
instant food. More rational eating will be accepted, and more
people will change their meat eating habits from the usual pork.
</P>
<P>
Consumer durables of high quality like cars and personal
computers will be popular with families with high salaries. But
ordinary families still won't have the purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that per capita spending on housing will
account for 15 percent of total expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Taxis will be used by more people in urban areas as the pace of
work and life become faster, and spending by urbanites on
telecommunications will grow by a big margin. By the year 2000,
phones will be common in more urban homes.
</P>
<P>
Urban spending on education will increase, as more urbanites
spend money getting practical skills instead of more literary
pursuits. By 2000, urbanites will spend 6 percent of their money
on this, the survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Shandong is one of the country's major grain producers, with a
fairly developed economy and higher urbanization than other parts
of the country, and ranks second after Henan Province in
population. Urban residents account for one-sixth of the 87
million people.

<HEADLINE> There May Still be Life on Mars: Israeli Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Although the unmanned U.S.
exploration mission has not yet indicated the evidence of life on
Mars, a leading Israeli astro-physicist said there may still be
life on the Red Planet.
</P>
<P>
Professor Giora Shaviv, head of the Asher Space Research
Institute of the prestigious university of Technion in Haifa,
told local newspaper the Jerusalem Post that "There could be life
half a meter or two meters underground."
</P>
<P>
"There might be sufficient humidity and moisture," he said in
an interview carried by the newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
He said the surface of the Red Planet looks to be a genuine
desert without life, but there is a possibility that life does
exist in shady areas or in the soil itself."
</P>
<P>
Shaviv stressed that life in such cases would be of the most
primitive forms, such as single cell organisms or even possibly
worms.
</P>
<P>
"If this turns out to be the case, it would be one of the most
important discoveries in the past 500 years. Evidence of life on
another planet would have a tremendous impact on our civilization,
our way of life, religion and our thoughts," he said.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the "beautiful and clear" pictures sent back by the
U.S. Mars Pathfinder. But he said they have not "provided us with
new information, or anything more than we knew before -- so far."
</P>
<P>
Shaviv said that Mars was a generally cold, arid planet which
derived its red, dust color from the fact that its ozone layer was
very close to the surface. "The best approximation we can make is
that it is entirely desert, although from the morphological shape
of different canyons you can infer that these were created by
floods in the distant past," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the features of canyons on Mars resembled those in the
Negev desert in southern Israel, though the difference was that
this is still happening today in the Negev while on Mars it
probably occurred millions or even billions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have long considered Mars to be the most likely
planet in the solar system to have conditions capable of
sustaining primitive life forms.
</P>
<P>
The theory of possible life on Mars was strengthened by the
discovery in the Antarctic several months ago of a piece of
meteorite from Mars in which scientists found fossils of
amoeba-like organisms.

<HEADLINE> State to Plant Trees for Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Afforestation is being accelerated
in China in a bid to ease the acute fuel shortage in most rural
areas, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The extensive planting of fast-growing firewood trees will also
help conserve China's swindling forest resources, Guo Huaiang, a
Ministry of Forestry official said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
After several years' decline, there was a 3.3 percent increase
in the acreage of fuel-oriented forestry in the country last year,
Guo said, adding that faster growth is expected this year.
</P>
<P>
According to him, rural people are beginning to allocate more
and more land to plant fuel timber, mainly energy-rich and
fast-growing deciduous trees that can grow under harsh conditions.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven counties across the country have been chosen as
pilot areas to launch the ministry's Forestry Energy Project since
last year. Ten more counties will soon join the program.
</P>
<P>
The project, as part of the country's rural energy development
drive, aims to plant 12 million hectares of new fuel-oriented
forestry from 1996 to 2015.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will invest 1.5 million yuan this year to promote
the project, which will depend mainly on funding by local
governments and farmers.
</P>
<P>
Experts said firewood has been, and will still be, the major
fuel source in China's rural areas for a long time, especially in
less-developed areas.
</P>
<P>
Each year, 250 million tons of firewood is used for cooking,
heating and other family uses -- one quarter of the total energy
used by rural families.
</P>
<P>
But only 160 million tons of natural firewood timber can be
supplied in China each year. Firewood accounts for one-third of
the country's annual consumption of forest resources.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that 16 million to 20 million hectares of
forest are needed to meet the basic energy demand in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Buddhist's Death Related to Money: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The murder of Japanese Buddhist
Bhikshu Yunataka Nawatame was mainly related to money, Nepali
Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Bamdev Gautam said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gautam told the Upper House that the Buddhist had returned with
some money taken from Kathmandu to Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord
Buddha where he was shot dead Thursday night, for the construction
of the Japanese World Peace Stupa there.
</P>
<P>
Investigation shows that after drinking at an inn at the
Lumbini area on the evening of July 3, the assassins went to the
Buddhist's house asking for money, local press reports quoted
Gautam as saying today.
</P>
<P>
After Bhikshu declined their demand, they immediately planned
to loot the money, Gautam said.
</P>
<P>
As all details about the assassins have already been obtained,
they cannot remain at large for long, he added.
</P>
<P>
People from all walks of life in Nepal have condemned this
terrorist act.

<HEADLINE> "Staged Accidents" Do Happen in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Some garages, or motor workshops
as they are called here, are working hand in glove with syndicates
that cause road mishaps deliberately, so that they can share the
profit from repairs and insurance claim, the Straits Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
One executive officer of Singapore's biggest motor insurer NTUC
(National Trade Union Congress) Income was quoted as saying that
in such staged mishaps, a vehicle driven by a syndicate member
would stop suddenly, usually on expressways, thus causing the
vehicle behind to crash into it.
</P>
<P>
A tow truck would then appear and offer to take the vehicles to
a workshop belonging to the syndicate for repairs. The workshop
then claims repair costs from the insurer of the motorist who has
hit the syndicate's vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Five other workshops and several industry sources said to the
Straits Times that they, too, had heard of staged incidents. But
they declined to be named for fear of what the syndicates might do
to them.
</P>
<P>
In describing another ploy, a manager in a car distribution
company said that a syndicate member would brake suddenly on the
road to create a chain collision behind, but without his car
getting hit.
</P>
<P>
He would then leave the scene immediately, leaving his workshop
accomplices to show up shortly to try to secure the repair
business.
</P>
<P>
"They can persuade motorists very easily to let them repair
their cars," said the report, quoting a claims manager from one of
the large insurance firms as saying, "You are in a state of shock.
The workshop man appears and is very gentlemanly, offers to take
you to the police station and lend you a car to drive for free. So
you are likely to let him take your car to repair".

<HEADLINE> Tamil MP's Murder Condemned in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The assassination of Tamil Member
of Parliament A. Thangathurai has been condemned by the ruling Sri
Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and his own party the Tamil United
Liberation Front (TULF).
</P>
<P>
Thangathurai and four others were killed in an explosion in
Trincomalee after a ceremony at a school building there on
Saturday night. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are
suspected to be responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The SLFP in a statement issued by its General Secretary,
Dharmasiri Senanayake, said Mr. Thangathurai was a senior
politician and skillful Parliamentarian who represented the people
of the East as a member of the TULF.
</P>
<P>
The SLFP condemns these brutal murders and regrets the
continued violence carried out in the midst of the most productive
dialogue that is going on regarding devolution of power, he said.
</P>
<P>
The TULF condemned the assassination of Thangathurai as a
cowardly and reprehensible act.
</P>
<P>
Party President. M. Sivasithamparam said in his statement that
the TULF was shocked and outraged at the murder of their
Administrative Secretary.
</P>
<P>
This cowardly and reprehensible act must be condemned without
reservation. The TULF is a democratic political movement of
non-violence and advocates the peaceful resolution of conflict, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that It has paid and continues to pay a heavy price
for this commitment. Several of its most revered leaders have been
defenseless victims of a cruel cycle of political assassinations.

<HEADLINE> LDP, JCP Score Major Wins in Tokyo Assembly Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) and the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) emerged as
winners in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 127 seats in the election, the LDP won 54 seats, up from
38 before the election, while the JCP won a record 26 seats. All
24 Komei candidates won their seats.
</P>
<P>
With the big victory, the JCP has now become the second-largest
party in the metropolitan assembly.
</P>
<P>
New parties such as Shinshinto (New Frontier Party) and
Minshuto (Democratic Party of Japan) suffered major setbacks.
</P>
<P>
The voting for the assembly took place at 1,789 polling
stations in the 63 wards, cities, towns and villages.
</P>
<P>
As temperatures in the city soared, voter turnout plummeted to
40.8, the lowest of any Tokyo or prefectural assembly polls. the
figure was far below the city's previous low of 51.43 percent in
the last assembly race held in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The election is believed to be indicative of national
sentiment, and is considered a precursor to the House of
Councillors vote scheduled for July 1998.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the heat, a lack of major issues dividing
parties and voters' disappointment with existing politicians,
apparently led to the low turnout, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Major Japanese newspapers, commenting on the election in their
editorials, said the low turnout reflected voters' distrust in
Japanese politics.

<HEADLINE> Direction of Baht's Fluctuation Unclear: Dealers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Currency dealers, perplexed by the
volatility of the baht in the last three days of last week, have
no clear view yet of how the baht will fluctuate this week.
</P>
<P>
Like some officials at the central bank, dealers say the baht
needs more time to settle at an appropriate level against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the baht will fluctuate this week depends on the
Bank of Thailand's strategy to control the game, one dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The mid-rate before the floating was just under 26 baht to the
dollar. Last Wednesday, the central bank of Thailand began to
un-peg the baht from the basket of currencies largely dominated by
the dollar and allowed the baht to flow.
</P>
<P>
The Thai currency plunged by 16 percent on the first day of
floating and fluctuated during the following two days last week
between 28-30 baht to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The money market was given a big shock when the central bank
took the step to float the baht in an attempt to help overcome the
country's economic sluggishness.
</P>
<P>
The baht has been attacked twice this year by speculators and
the central bank has spent 6 billion dollars to save the baht.
</P>
<P>
Dealers commented that the value of the baht from now on will
totally reflect the competence of the government and how well it
manages the country.
</P>
<P>
Whether or not the baht becomes stable depends on currency
investors who will determine its value by looking at several
factors such as political, economic and social concerns.

<HEADLINE> Floating Baht to Reduce Thailand's Treasury Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The increasing foreign debt burden
caused by the floating baht coupled with a government revenue
shortfall may lead to the depletion of the already low treasury
reserves of Thailand, finance analysts fear.
</P>
<P>
Treasury reserves at the end of May stood at 290 billion baht
(about 11.15 billion U.S. dollars), down from 401 billion baht
(15.73 billion dollars) at the end of September 1996, due to a
shortfall in government revenues.
</P>
<P>
For the current and next fiscal years, the treasury reserves
are likely to be depleted, due partly to an increase in the
external debt resulting from floating the baht and partly to
possible shortfalls in government revenue.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has set aside 32.45 billion baht (about
1.16 billion dollars) for foreign debt service in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
The size of the debt increase will depend on the level at which
the volatile baht stabilize against the U.S. dollar and Japanese
yen.
</P>
<P>
Some Finance Ministry officials predict that the baht will
hover around the 28-30 range against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the floating baht will affect government
revenue sources such as import, excise, corporate and value-added
taxes.
</P>
<P>
Government income from state enterprises is also certain to
fall short of the target due to their increasing debts and
operating costs.

Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund.
</P>
<P>
Production equipment has been imported from Italy, France, and
the US. More than 30 million yuan has been used for basic energy,
power and water supply projects for the plant.

future, some Hong Kong investors say.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The birth rate of central China's
Henan province fell to 14.28 per thousand last year from 24.28 per
thousand at the end of the 1986-1990 period, according to recent
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Henan is the country's most heavily populated province, and the
number of people working in agriculture accounts for 87 percent of
that.
</P>
<P>
It was no small achievement for the province to bring its
population growth down so rapidly, experts here say. The officials
in charge of family planning said they have make special efforts
to improve their work methods by providing enlightened education
rather than simply criticising. And it plans to keep up that
way. More media coverage will be given to the issue, and officials
at the grassroots level are expected to disseminate information
regularly on birth control among women of child-bearing age.

<HEADLINE> Foundation Assists Western Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Farmers of West China are getting
help from a non-governmental institution with the purpose of
helping the poor population eliminate poverty and accumulate
wealth, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The project, established by the Foundation for Underdeveloped
Regions in China, includes developing arable land by removing
stones, building houses in Southwest China and setting up
rainwater-storage cellars in Northwest China.
</P>
<P>
It aims at improving production and life conditions for poor
farmers, Sun Wenfang, vice-president of the Foundation, was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
In Southwest China's karst area, naked rocks, steep slopes and
rare soil cause loss of water, and the erosion of fertilizer and
soil. In Southwest China's Guizhou province, each person has only
0.91 mu (0.06 hectares) cultivated land and less than 300
kilograms grain on average. Shortage of food forces 7.89 million
people live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
To transform the harsh mountains into fertile farm land is the
only way for mountaineers to get out of poverty. And 800 yuan can
change one mu into one with high and stable grain yield, according
to Sun.
</P>
<P>
The foundation has begun such a program in Anshun Prefecture of
Guizhou province.
</P>
<P>
Rainwater-storage cellars will be built in some arid
northwestern areas where surface and underground water are
deficient, the English daily said.

<P>
DALIAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The southern section of a water
diversion project financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in
Dalian, a port city in northeast China, has finished and is
operating.
</P>
<P>
The project, started in 1994, was designed to divert water into
Dalian from the Biliu River 150 km away. It is ADB's first
investment in China in an urban water supply project. The project
will cost 3 billion yuan (about 367 million U.S. dollars), with
160 million U.S. dollars covered by ADB loans.
</P>
<P>
It is scheduled to be finished in three years and will have a
daily water supply capacity of 1.2 million cu.m.
</P>
<P>
The southern section cost 1.8 billion yuan and involves an
administrative network, pumping stations, water and purification
plants. A northern section involves underground water diversion
canals and is expected to be finished by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Dalian has 2.4 million people and more than 6,000
overseas-backed businesses, and suffers from severe water
shortages. It only has a daily fresh water supply capacity of
800,000 cu.m. and has great difficulties meeting production and
residential water demands.

realized his dream in Sao Paulo on Sunday by beating multi Olympic
gold medallist Alexander Popov in a 100 meter duel.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Forgives Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Evander Holyfield offered
forgiveness to Mike Tyson for biting off part of his ear Sunday,
but he ruled out the possibility of an out-of-country rematch
against the disgraced ex-champion.
</P>
<P>
Opening a global marketing camaign in South Africa, Holyfield
said he was not angry with Tyson for the infamous bite fight and
had "put the incident behind."
</P>
<P>
"I laugh at it. Yes, he bit my ear. Now people call me
the 'Real Meal.' It's comical, it's part of life," Holyfield
said, referring to his boxing nickname "Real Deal."
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters along with his wife, Janice, the World
Boxing Association heavyweight champ said he has "forgiven" Tyson,
and hopes that younger fighters will learn from the sensational
incident.
</P>
<P>
When asked if he would fight an overseas rematch against Tyson
if he is banned from boxing in the US, Holyfield said he will
"live with the rules and regulations."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the Nevada State Athletic Commission which
meets Wednesday to decide Tyson's fate. The infamous bite caused
the controversial fighter to lose by disqualification, and could
result in a temporary or life suspension and a three
million-dollar fine.
</P>
<P>
Other countries, including Britain could also institute a ban,
but the manager of German middleweight world champion Dariusz
Michalczewski has already offered Tyson the chance to continue his
career in Germany regardless of the decision.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Italian rider Mario Cipollini won the
first stage and took the lead of the Tour de France from prologue
winner Chris Boardman on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The sprint maestro, winner of five stages in the recent Giro
d'Italia, beat Belgian Tom Steels and France's Frederic Moncassin
in the opening stage from Forges-les-Eaux to Rouen.
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant Italian, who sported the yellow jersey for a
couple of days in 1993, was the hero of the day but his feat was
overshadowed by a massive fall in the last 10 km.
</P>
<P>
The crash, which forced Frenchman Gilles Talmant out with a
broken arm, delayed last year's winner Bjarne Riis as well as race
favourites Alex Zuelle and Luc Leblanc, who lost precious time.
</P>
<P>
"I could not expect any better than today," said Cipollini. "I
had a good Giro d'Italia and now I feel in great shape for this
Tour. I must thank all my team who did a fantastic job."
</P>
<P>
In the last 40km, his Saeco team mates chased down three
riders, Lithuanian Arturas Kasputis, Italian Luca Colombo and
Dutchman Servais Knaven, who had broken away after 91km.
</P>
<P>
The three were caught with 15km to go, just after the crash
which involved a dozen riders and held up about thirty. Last
year's winner Riis lost 58 seconds and Zuelle 95.
</P>
<P>
Monday's second stage will cover 262 kilometers from
St. Valery-en-Caux to Vire.

<HEADLINE> Russia Finishes Third at European Men's Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Mikhail Mikhailov scored a game-high
35 points to help Russia beat Greece 97-77 with ease and finish
third at the European Men's Basketball Championships in Barcelona
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The win was a small consolation for Russia, which was intent on
facing defending champion Yugoslavia. But Italy upset Russia in
the semifinals on Saturday, pitting Yugoslavia against the
Italians in the tournament's final Sunday night for the title.
</P>
<P>
Mihailov had 21 of his 35 in the second half, but it was
Russia's superior speed withy a three-guard offense that also
caused problems for Greece.
</P>
<P>
With Mikhailov and forward Sergei Panov helping Russia to a
30-17 rebound advantage, Vassily Karassev scored 19 while Igor
Koudelin and Sergei Babkov added 12 and nine points.
</P>
<P>
Center Efthimis Rentzias led Greece with 28 points, nearly all
of it in the first half. After scoring 22 before halftime, the
2.13-meter Rentzias was held to only six the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
Greek forward Nikolaos Ekonomou added 12 points.
</P>
<P>
In other consolation games, Spain beat Lithuania 94-93 for
fifth place and Poland topped Turkey 89-87 for seventh.

<HEADLINE> Violence Spreads in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Violence hit Northern Ireland today
following a parade by the Protestant Orange Order, according to
reports from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
A senior leader of the Irish Republican Army's (IRA) political
wing told a rally in Londonderry this evening that Catholics
should "stand up for their rights", urging them to "take to the
streets" in protest at the parade which was allowed to march down
a Catholic area of Portadown.
</P>
<P>
"The place to be demanding justice is on the streets
confronting your opponents," Sinn Fein leader Martin McGuinness
said to wild applause.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a Northern Ireland police-woman was injured when a
gunman fired on a police vehicle.
</P>
<P>
This was the second shooting incident following the midday
parade in Portadown.
</P>
<P>
Police said several cars were hijacked and set ablaze by youths
as part of protests which hit Catholic areas of Belfast and
Londonderry.
</P>
<P>
In Lurgan, near Portadown, armed men hijacked a train and
torched all six carriages before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British Orange Order was given massive police and army
protection and allowed to march along Portadown's Catholic
Garvaghy Road in face of bitter opposition from the area's Irish
nationalist residents.
</P>
<P>
Violence hit Portadown when Catholic youths clashed with
security forces at the end of the annual Orangemen's march.
</P>
<P>
Twelve police officers were injured in Portadown. Around a
dozen civilians were also hurt.
</P>
<P>
The renewed violence at the height of Northern Ireland's annual
marching season dealt a severe blow to already badly compromised
efforts to bring peace to the province.
</P>
<P>
Chances of a new ceasefire being declared by the IRA, which has
been waging guerrilla war since 1969 to end British rule, also
appeared to recede.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Ireland, co-sponsors of peace efforts in the
province, will not allow Sinn Fein to take its place at all-party
peace talks unless the IRA calls a credible ceasefire.

<HEADLINE> Heatwave Again Hits Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Heatwave once again hit Greece this
weekend, with temperatures in the capital city of Athens and
cities around the country soaring above 40 degree Celsius.
</P>
<P>
The heatwave, the second to sweep the country in three weeks,
is expected to continue until Wednesday, when temperatures are
expected to return to the low-and mid-30 degree Celsius, weather
forecasting services said.
</P>
<P>
State emergency services are reportedly placed on alert to deal
with the effects of the heatwave, including health problems and
forest fires. Parts of air conditioned public buildings have been
made available for people to take refuge from the sweltering heat.
</P>
<P>
Athenians and other urban center residents were urged to stay
indoors, drink plenty of non alcoholic beverages, avoid physical
exertion and stay out of sun and find a cool place to sit.
</P>
<P>
People fled "burning" cities to escape the heat by going to
beaches and mountains throughout the country, as a result, a high
number of car accidents was reported with the death toll for the
weekend standing at 20 this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two forest fires broke out in the northwestern
Epirus region, attributed mainly to the high temperatures. The
blazes near Konitsa and Ioannina have so far burnt 500 acres of
pine forest.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, a heatwave had killed 900 people across the country.
