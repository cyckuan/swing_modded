White House E-mail Furor Rages
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is raising the possibility it may invoke
executive privilege to keep Congress from seeing some documents in the furor
over missing e-mails under subpoena in investigations ranging from Whitewater to
impeachment, documents disclosed Monday. The White House sent the House
Government Reform Committee a one-page list of documents it is not turning over
under subpoena because of executive privilege and attorney-client
confidentiality. Among documents on the list, which was obtained by The
Associated Press, are notes by White House lawyers involving discussions they
had with computer experts about the e-mails.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three countries courted by the United States for a better
relationship -- Iran, Syria and North Korea -- were again branded as sponsors of
terrorism by the State Department today along with Cuba, Iraq, Libya and Sudan.
A yearly report showed a shift in concern from the Middle East to South Asia,
where Afghanistan is a favorite haven for terrorists and Pakistan has backed
groups that engage in violence in Kashmir.

ABC-TV Is Off Some Cable Systems
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In an escalating corporate dispute, ABC-TV was blacked out
in the homes of 3.5 million Time Warner cable customers around the country
Monday -- just as the ratings ''sweeps'' period was beginning. The Walt Disney
Co., ABC's corporate parent, is fighting over how much money Time Warner must
compensate Disney for the right to carry some of its cable channels. The
affected customers were in seven markets served by ABC-owned television
stations. About 1.5 million were in the New York City area, 665,000 in Houston
and 440,000 in Raleigh-Durham, N.C.

   HAVANA (AP) -- Fidel Castro joined the annual May Day parade today for the
first time in years and ended a speech with a cell phone call to Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, urging him to continue his fight to bring his refugee son, Elian, home
to Cuba. Castro led hundreds of thousands of Cubans from Havana's Plaza of the
Revolution to the U.S. Interests Section. ''Fidel! Fidel!'' chanted the crowd in
the annual march that traditionally involves workers. In a speech, Castro
praised Cubans for their tenacity.

Bush Decried on Social Security
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- GOP presidential campaigner George W. Bush's plan for
Social Security was dismissed today by the White House as set ''in a world where
budgets don't exist.'' Bush is considering proposing -- as Republicans in
Congress have -- a plan through which workers could invest a portion of their
Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market. White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart said Bush needed to provide more details on his proposal and ''stop
talking about campaign promises in a vacuum.''

Israel Expects Palestinian State
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   EILAT, Israel (AP) -- Trying to improve the climate in peace talks, Israeli
officials said Monday they've resigned themselves to Palestinian statehood, and
the Palestinians acknowledged Israel's pain on Holocaust Remembrance Day. But
negotiators reported little progress and awaited the arrival of a U.S. mediator
Tuesday to help draft an outline of a final peace treaty. Israeli officials said
they would not oppose a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but
said the Palestinians should accept that some Jewish settlements there will
become part of Israel.

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Martin Brodeur withstood Toronto's best period
of the series and went on to stop 22 shots in leading the Devils to a 5-1
victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Monday night. Jason Arnott, Scott Gomez,
Patrik Elias, Petr Sykora and Alexander Mogilny scored as the Devils took a 2-1
lead in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference semifinal series. Elias also had
two assists as New Jersey dominated for the third straight game. New Jersey
could easily have a 3-0 lead if Curtis Joseph hadn't stolen the opening game
with a 32-save performance in a 2-1 Toronto victory.

	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Two Camden County men were arrested Monday
night, charged in the murder-for-hire of the wife of a prominent
Cherry Hill rabbi, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Jenoff, 54, of Collingswood, and Paul M. Daniels, 26, of
Pennsauken, were charged with murder and conspiracy to commit
murder in connection with the killing of Carol Neulander,
Prosecutor Lee Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, 52, was bludgeoned to death on Nov. 1, 1994, in her
Cherry Hill home. Investigators say she was killed by a hit man
posing as a deliveryman.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Rabbi Fred J. Neulander, found her body when he
returned from Congregation M'Kor Shalom synagogue. Her purse was
missing, but no other valuables were touched.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Neulander had been considered the sole suspect in his
wife's killing. He was indicted in January 1999 on charges of
accomplice murder and conspiracy to commit murder. He is free on
bail awaiting his trial, which is scheduled to begin in June.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor's spokesman Greg Reinert said Jenoff is a friend of
the rabbi. A private investigator, he was hired by Neulander to
work on the case. Daniels was ''known to Jenoff,'' Reinert said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if officials believe Neulander hired the hit men,
Reinert said he could not comment on Neulander's case because it is
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Wixted and Jeffrey Zucker, Neulander's attorneys, said
the rabbi was shocked when he learned of the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   They said Jenoff had repeatedly said under oath that Neulander
was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he's changed his tune, we'll have to wait and see why,''
Wixted told FOX-TV in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the very beginning of this, he's always been on the
rabbi's side and always said he had nothing to do with it,'' Zucker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said a hearing on the case is scheduled for May 9 with
Superior Court Judge Linda G. Rosenzweig.
</P>
<P>
   ''My belief is we should (meet) with the judge to get an idea of
where we stand with respect to the trial,'' Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff's attorney, Francis J. Hartman, told the Courier-Post of
Cherry Hill for Tuesday's editions that his client contacted
Solomon and arranged to meet him and an investigator Friday. At
that meeting, Jenoff ''told them he was the intermediary between
the rabbi and someone who would kill his wife,'' Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman said Jenoff recruited Daniels for the job. He said he
did not know if Jenoff was at the Neulander home the night of the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman said Jenoff called the prosecutor because he felt
remorse about Carol Neulander's death. The attorney said his client
had hoped for a plea agreement or even immunity in exchange for his
cooperation, but Solomon was ''not hearing anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff and Daniels were scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in
state Superior Court in Camden.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said Neulander had his wife of 29 years killed
so that he could continue his extramarital affair with Philadelphia
radio personality Elaine Soncini.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Neulander thought divorce would jeopardize his
position as senior rabbi at the synagogue, which he founded with
his wife in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Soncini admitted having a two-year affair with Neulander that
ended shortly after his wife's killing. She has not been charged
with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Soncini has told authorities that Neulander told her that their
problem would be solved by December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander stepped down from his synagogue post in February 1995
after reports of his affairs with two congregants. He was later
suspended by a rabbinical panel.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff and Daniels were being in the held Camden County Jail on
Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Groups try to force Pataki's hand on fire-safe cigarettelegislation  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Supporters of so-called fire-safe cigarette
legislation are hoping tobacco whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand can
force their cause just as he did for a national settlement over
cigarette marketing and youth smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Wigand, whose tale inspired the 1999 film ''The Insider'' joined
a coalition of firefighters and anti-smoking groups on Monday in
urging Gov. George Pataki to sign the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an opportunity for New York to take a leadership role
to really establish the mechanism by which children can be
protected,'' said Wigand, a former Brown &AMP; Williamson executive.
</P>
<P>
   Both houses of the state Legislature have approved the bill
requiring that only fire-safe cigarettes be sold in the state
starting in April 2002. Pataki has not said what he will do.
</P>
<P>
   Of the approximately 1,000 people who die in cigarette-related
fires each year, 150 to 200 are children, said Wigand, a former New
York resident.
</P>
<P>
   Wigand helped push the industry to a settlement of a
class-action lawsuit brought by the 50 states when he went to the
CBS television show ''60 Minutes'' in 1995 with claims of perjury
and other wrongdoing by the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies, Wigand said, have for years known how to
create cigarettes that self-extinguish when the smoker stops
puffing, but have been resistant to change because no legislation
has pushed them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Help them do the right thing,'' Wigand said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Sciandra, of the Center For a Tobacco Free New York,
said he and others would meet with a Pataki counsel Monday to
discuss the legislation. In addition, Sciandra said his group's Web
site allows people to send Pataki electronic postcards endorsing
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The groups focused especially on cigarette-maker Philip Morris
because it has not been as active in opposing the fire-safe
legislation as other manufacturers. The company is test-marketing
fire-safe cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's ''pen can be the straw that breaks the camel's back,
pun intended,'' Kevin James, a New York City fire marshal and
member of the Islamic Society of Fire Department Personnel, Inc.,
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Assemblyman Alexander Grannis, D-Manhattan,
said the bill he was a main sponsor of would probably be delivered
to Pataki Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's office said the governor would review the bill when he
receives it.
</P>
<P>
   Groups pushing for the legislation included the American College
of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the League of Women Voters and North
American Fire Marshal's Association.

<HEADLINE> Attorney general says bottle bill should be expanded  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York's ''bottle law'' should also impose
a 5-cent deposit on cans and bottles containing three
ever-more-popular beverages: spring water, sports drinks and juice,
according to state Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the popularity of the three drinks was not
envisioned in 1982, when the redeemable container law was enacted
to encourage the recycling of cans and bottles containing beer and
carbonated drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer also said Monday the state's requirement that
municipalities recycle must be shored up and he threatened to sue
the city of Amsterdam, in Montgomery County, in a month if it does
not reinstitute the recycling program it suspended as of Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Procopio, co-founder of the state Bottle and Can
Redemption Association and owner of a Syracuse redemption center,
said excluding non-carbonated drinks from the bottle law showed a
lack of foresight by legislators about future beverage-consumption
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   He said it is estimated that every person in New York now
consumes about 125 bottles and cans containing non-carbonated
beverages a year.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say it is more efficient to get those containers
recycled by requiring deposits on them rather than having residents
and waste haulers weed the containers out of the waste stream.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer also proposed a bill to close what he said is a loophole
in the state's mandatory recycling law, which dates to 1988. That
law said every community must have a local recycling program in
place by 1992, but it created a dodge of sorts by saying those
localities only had to recycle if it is economically feasible to
local governments.
</P>
<P>
   With prices falling for may kinds of recyclable materials,
Spitzer said his office is now investigating numerous instances
where glass, plastic, newsprint and other recyclables are being
dumped in landfills.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's proposal would clarify that recyclables cannot be
dumped in landfills or incinerators.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said he has given city of Amsterdam
officials until June 1 to make a ''reasonable and forthright''
effort to reinstitute a recycling program in that city about 30
miles west of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam officials temporarily suspended the city's recycling
program starting Jan. 1. In March, its common council rejected all
bids received from companies interested in winning a new contract,
saying they were too expensive. The lowest bid was $188,000 for one
year, which is about double what the city was paying its old
recycler.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam terminated its contract with County Waste and
Recycling Services Inc. last year after receiving complaints that
glass, cans and other recyclables were being commingled with
non-recyclables and dumped in a landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said he knew of no other instance where a municipality
has been sued for failing to recycle. Amsterdam was the only
locality in the state refusing to do so, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no doubt that we will win,'' Spitzer said. ''I am not
saying this as a threat to the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam Deputy Mayor Ray Halgas said the city has worked hard
to gather bids on a new recycling program and to explore other
options. A new round of bids is due back on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have covered all the bases. We haven't let anything go,''
Halgas said. ''I know I am doing what I was elected to do by the
people in the city of Amsterdam. We could have just said, 'Hey,
it's 200 grand, let's just do it and let the people of Amsterdam
pay for it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Halgas said a $188,000 recycling bill on the city was akin to
the state imposing an ''unfunded mandate'' on the locality.
Amsterdam officials have called for months for the state to provide
funds to help pay for its recycling program.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said there is money available to help communities pay
for recycling through the state's 1996 environmental bond act and
other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Many municipalities and waste haulers have complained that
sinking prices have made recycling unprofitable. Spitzer said
recycling can still make money if done right, and he predicted that
the impending closure of New York City's Fresh Kills landfill in
December 2001 will change the economics of the whole recycling
industry in New York state to make the selling of recyclable
materials more lucrative.

<HEADLINE> Senate approves bill undoing pollution credit advantages  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York utilities would lose any incentive
to sell pollution credits in the states chiefly blamed for creating
acid rain under a bill headed to Gov. George Pataki's desk.
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate Monday gave final passage to the measure
designed to keep the pollution credits earned in New York from
being converted into emissions and dumped back on the state through
utilities and companies in 14 Southern and Midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   ''We aren't talking about whether a few more lakes will die,''
said Timothy Burke, head of the Adirondack Council. ''We are
talking about saving the Adirondacks from ecological destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The sponsor of the bill in the Senate, Nassau County Republican
Carl Marcellino, said the measure will send a message to the
federal government that the system of selling pollution credits is
harming Northeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   More than 700,000 credits -- each representing the right to emit
one ton of sulfur dioxide -- have been accumulated by New York
utilities. The credits generally sell for between $100 and $140 on
the open market.
</P>
<P>
   New York utilities qualify for about 300,000 new credits each
year, Marcellino said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would create a mechanism for the state Public
Service Commission to step forward when New York utilities sell a
credit in one of the proscribed states. The amount of the profit
would be diverted from the utility and put into a special state
account to fund alternative energy projects.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would apply to the sale of pollution credits by New
York utilities in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware,
Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan,
Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Marcellino said he expected Pataki to sign the bill, which was
approved 59-0 Monday, into law. It passed in the state Assembly in
March.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Richard Dollinger, D-Rochester, said the state should
prevent its utilities from selling the credits anywhere by buying
all outstanding and future credits itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''The better thing to do is to put our money where our mouth is
... so that no one in this state, on this planet, can run into the
problems that we have had,'' Dollinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcellino said the state could not afford to spend that kind of
money.
</P>
<P>
   The state Energy Association, which represents New York's
private utilities, predicted the measure would harm the economy by
raising the cost of generating electricity in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The trade organization also said utilities will find lower
prices for their credits when they try to sell them among a limited
number of states. There is also no conclusive evidence, the Energy
Association said, that not selling the credits in the 14 states
will reduce acid emissions being absorbed by the Adirondacks or
other parts of New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Acid rain is blamed on utilities which burn high-sulfur fuel.
The pollution is carried eastward and northward by the jet stream
and falls clinging to drops of rain or flakes of snow in the
Northeast. It is blamed for biologically ''killing'' hundreds of
lakes in New York by destroying their acidic balance.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative passage of the bill ended a running battle between
the state Assembly and Senate which became particularly sharp last
summer. At that time, the two chambers could not agree whether the
bill should apply to new pollution credits or to the more than
700,000 credits already accumulated by New York utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, D-Westchester, said the bill is
''infinitely improved'' over the prospective bill the Senate
favored because it applied to the old credits as well as new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would not fold on the issue of the over 700,000 credits
which might have come back,'' Brodsky said Monday. ''And this is
not chopped liver.''
</P>
<P>
   Several environmental groups, including the Adirondack Council,
angered Brodsky by siding with the Senate in the dispute last
summer.

<HEADLINE> State's sex-offender registry being challenged this week  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The sex-offender registry established by New
York state's version of Megan's Law will be under judicial scrutiny
this week by members of the state's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments in two cases
involving offenders who are challenging their required inclusion on
the sex-crime registry.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Megan's Law took effect in 1996, thanks in part to
personal lobbying in the state Legislature by Maureen Kanka. She is
the Hamilton Township, N.J., woman whose daughter Megan was killed
by a sex offender living near the Kanka home in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Information can be accessed through a 900 telephone number by
people seeking to know whether a person is on the registry due to a
sex-related conviction.
</P>
<P>
   One of the cases being heard by the Court of Appeals this
Thursday involves a man identified in court papers only as ''David
W.'' He was sentenced to one year in jail for refusing to sign a
registration form which classified him as a risk level three sex
offender or a ''sexually violent predator'' in the state's sex
registry.
</P>
<P>
   Level three is the highest-risk category of offenders and the
only classification of sex-related criminals listed in the
registry.
</P>
<P>
   David W., of Southampton in Suffolk County, was convicted in
1995 of sodomizing and sexually abusing two boys. His lawyer
Charles Newell will argue before the Court of Appeals that since
David W.'s crimes were committed before the state's sex registry
was set up, he is being denied his constitutional due process
rights by the way he was classified as a level three offender.
</P>
<P>
   Those convicted after 1996 are assigned risk classifications by
judges and have a right to be heard on those decisions. But sex
offenders prior to 1996 get classified by parole or probation
officers without a hearing, and David W. will contend that is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Level three violators must report to local police every 90 days
and be subject to public release of their photographs and criminal
histories. Those offenders are considered to be most likely to
commit sex crimes again.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, Ian Kearns' lawyer Elizabeth Miller will
argue before the Court of Appeals that sex offenders should be able
to appeal the classifications within the sex registry which are
determined by judges.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in Kearns' case will argue that appeals should not
be allowed on risk-level assessments and, at any rate, that Kearns
waved his right to appeal by pleading guilty to a sexual abuse
charge involving a 16-year-old girl in the Bronx which underlies
his inclusion in the sex registry.
</P>
<P>
   Other cases before the judges during their May session include:
</P>
<P>
   BELL LABS
</P>
<P>
   The state Public Service Commission is seeking reinstatement of
its order requiring New York Telephone to repay customers $19.5
million. That is the company's share of its profit from the sale of
the former Bell Telephone Laboratories and the Western Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between the PSC and New York Telephone dates back to
the 1984 government-ordered breakup of the old AT&AMP;T monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The PSC estimates that each customer of New York Telephone would
be in line for a credit of about $2.44 if the repayment order is
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGES' PAY
</P>
<P>
   A salary dispute dating to 1978, when the state unified New
York's court system, will be before the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   A lower court ruled that Monroe County Court judges should get
$131,400 a year, the same amount as Albany County Court judges. The
Monroe County Court judges currently make $125,600 a year, but they
are arguing that their court loads are similar to their colleagues
in Albany and they should be paid accordingly.

<HEADLINE> New York dairy group vows to continue fighting dairy compact  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Despite losing its final court battle, a
New York dairy group said it would continue fighting a compact that
sets minimum prices for milk sold in six northeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected the
argument by New York State Dairy Foods, Inc. that the Northeast
Dairy Compact Commission's pricing plan discriminates against
processors located outside New England.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Boston had previously upheld the pricing
rules, as did the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last November.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to oppose the unfair compact system through
legislative means here in New York state,'' Bruce Krupke, executive
vice president of New York State Dairy Foods, Inc., said in a
statement. ''We will also continue to try to enlighten our state's
legislators and dairy farmers on the negative impact the compact
would have if allowed to include New York state.''
</P>
<P>
   The compact was born in 1996, when Congress allowed
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont
and Maine to group together to regulate milk prices in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The group sets minimum prices, which can be higher than the
price set by the federal government. Milk processors make payments
into a pool, and money from that pool is sent back to the
processors for distribution to the dairy farmers from whom they
bought milk.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Northeast plan, processors located in New England
receive rebates based on the total amount of milk they sell,
whether in the six-state region or elsewhere. Processors located
outside the region get rebates based on how much milk they sell in
New England in liquid form -- not milk for making into cheese, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge by New York State Dairy Foods began in 1997. The
trade group, which represents New York-based milk processors
Cumberland Farms, Crowley Foods, and Elmhurst Dairy, said dairy
farmers get a higher payback from New England processors and
therefore farmers prefer to do business with them.
</P>
<P>
   Although Krupke cited higher consumer prices as one of the
negatives of the compact, Carl Peterson saw only positives in the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been in business 49 years and my son wants to stay in
business,'' said Peterson, one of approximately 1,000 farmers in
eastern New York who sell milk to the compact. ''It's like a safety
net when prices drop low. It would make it very, very difficult
because we're just surviving right now. I'm gratified.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, was Mae Schmidle, vice chair of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're extremely pleased with the outcome of this,'' she said.
''It certainly indicates the Northeast Dairy Compact is progressing
in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   New York is the third-largest dairy producing state in the
nation behind California and Wisconsin. It was denied admittance to
the compact last year after a bitter political battle broke out
over whether it should be abolished. The fight pitted the Northeast
against the Midwest, where there is widespread opposition to the
regional compacts.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, who took over the family farm just west of Albany from
his father in 1961, said he wasn't sure what would happen if the
compact was abolished because milk prices are down so much, at
their lowest in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a lot tighter this year, even with the compact,'' he
said. ''We're down $1.50 (per hundred pounds) from last year. And
we expect on the year to be down an average of $1.75. Without it,
the average would have been $2.75. That would have made it very
difficult.''

Socially responsible investing showing growth
AP Membership Enterprise, 
By JEREMY BOYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) -- For years, the idea of investing money
strictly in companies that share your social values was considered
by financial analysts to be a good for the conscience and bad for
the wallet.
</P>
<P>
   But the days of beating up on socially responsible investing
seem to be long gone, thanks in large part to strong performances
of many SRI funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The debate is opening up,'' said Susan Lhota, a marketing
associate with the Cobleskill-based Fenimore Asset Management, a
mutual fund and private money management company.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a whole new genre of SRI funds coming out and many
more people are interested in investing in companies who have
passed socially responsible screens.''
</P>
<P>
   SRI funds work by screening potential companies for
characteristics in addition to financial performance. Typical
companies that are avoided by socially responsible investors
include tobacco, alcohol, firearms and gambling firms.
</P>
<P>
   Another screen for many investors is environmental performance
and labor practices. Producing potentially harmful products or
engaging in environmentally destructive behavior are considered
negative screens, but many funds also weigh positive screens, such
as diverse boards of directors or community involvement.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the types of companies that most often fit this
screen are technology-oriented. With the performance of technology
stocks in recent years, the recent troubles in that sector
notwithstanding, SRI funds are seeing unprecedented growth.
</P>
<P>
   Five-star rating Morningstar Inc., a leading national
independent securities analysis firm, now places 21 percent of the
SRI funds it tracks in its lofty five-star rating, which is twice
the rate of overall funds. Just two years ago, no SRI funds were in
that top category.
</P>
<P>
   With the strong performance of SRI funds, the number of people
investing in them has skyrocketed. From 1997 to 1999, the total
assets managed in screened portfolios for socially conscious
investors rose from $529 billion to $1.49 trillion, according to
the Social Investment Forum, a national nonprofit organization that
promotes the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Social Investment Forum also reports that the number of screened
mutual funds grew from 55 in 1995 to 175 in 1999. Another sign that
SRI is becoming mainstream is the creation of socially conscious
funds by reputable firms, such as Vanguard, which plans to start an
SRI index fund on May 8.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, most of the major brokerage firms have some
kind of an offering,'' said Lowell Miller, president of
Miller/Howard Investments in Woodstock, which offers an SRI fund of
its own.
</P>
<P>
   For people who have not plunged into the world of socially
responsible investing, a wealth of information is available on the
internet. Web sites that Miller recommended include
www.greenmoney.com, which lists socially responsible funds. Another
site belongs to the Social Investment Forum, www.socialinvest.org.
A simple query using the words ''socially responsible investing''
on most internet search engines will yield dozens of sites.
</P>
<P>
   Financial planners warn, however, that the world of SRI funds
can sometimes be a little murky. Each fund is managed with
different sets of criteria, so it's important to know exactly what
screens are being employed.
</P>
<P>
   The people at Fenimore Asset Management are learning that lesson
firsthand. Although FAM has always avoided certain companies such
as tobacco or alcohol firms, it has not yet offered a full-blown
socially conscious fund.
</P>
<P>
   George Chelius III, director of marketing at FAM, said the
company is exploring the idea of launching an SRI fund, and it is
encountering some dilemmas. As an example, he cited a company that
makes ball bearings for both magnetic resonance imaging machines in
hospitals and for defense weapons. FAM has frequently invested in
that company, but it may not fit into an SRI fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''You always get into these gray areas,'' Chelius said. Miller
said there are also SRI funds that focus exclusively on one type of
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are funds that invest according to Islamic beliefs and
funds that invest only with an eye on the treatment of animals,''
he said. ''There are all kinds of social screens, so it's important
for an investor to check them out.''

<HEADLINE> Boy finds body of dead infant brother in woods  </HEADLINE>
By HADLEY PAWLAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, N.Y. (AP) -- A 29-year-old woman is being charged
with the second-degree murder of her infant son.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Ramsey gave police a detailed statement and was charged
with second-degree murder, according to Saratoga County Sheriff
James Bowen.
</P>
<P>
   ''She admitted to giving birth to the young boy, and he was
alive and crying,'' Bowen said. ''She wrapped it in a towel, and
took it across the street from the residence and placed it in the
woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey was being held without bail in Saratoga County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   The infant's body was found by his 9-year-old brother who had
been riding his bike through the woods with a 13-year-old neighbor
around 8 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 13-year-old's mother, Pat St. Louis, her son
was upset when he came in for dinner because the boys thought they
had found the St. Louises' dead pet Siamese cat.
</P>
<P>
   After supper, St. Louis and her husband, Mark, accompanied their
son across the street and found a partially decomposed, naked,
blond baby boy wrapped in a pink or faded towel, Pat St. Louis
said.
</P>
<P>
   They called the sheriff's department.
</P>
<P>
   The baby, who was named Alexander Scott by his mother, was alive
at the time of abandonment, said Saratoga County Coroner John
DeMartino.
</P>
<P>
   According to the coroner's office, Alexander was left in the
woods in January, about 75 feet from a rural road.
</P>
<P>
   Albany County forensic pathologist Dr. Barbara Wolf conducted
the autopsy and authorities expected a preliminary cause of death
to be determined today, with toxicology results to follow.
</P>
<P>
   If found guilty, Rose Ramsey faces a sentence of 25 years to
life.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys live in one of four mobile homes clustered together
on a 1.5 mile road nestled in this sparsely populated area in the
Adirondack foothills.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor who also saw the infant's body said the incident had
shocked her.
</P>
<P>
   ''Looking at the baby you could see what that it was freshly
born and had just been sat out there,'' Linda Skeens said. ''It
makes you wonder if she ever walked over there to see the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowen said that Ramsey gave birth at home but kept the pregnancy
a secret from her entire family. Ramsey told police that her
husband had threatened to leave her if she had another child.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that she left the baby with no provisions for its
care,'' Saratoga County District Attorney James A. Murphy III said
at a news conference Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to fast track this,'' Murphy said. ''It's an
absolute tragedy.''

<HEADLINE> May Day Rallies Create Tensions  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTIN GAZLAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Anti-capitalist protesters clashed with police
Monday in central London, tearing down the golden arches of a
McDonald's and spray-painting a hammer and sickle on a statue of
Winston Churchill in a May Day protest.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, a march against ''capitalism and imperialism'' Monday
night erupted into violence in the Kreuzberg neighborhood, a
stronghold of leftist activism. More than 100 police officers were
injured as they used water cannons, tear gas and nightsticks
against a crowd of 10,000 anarchists. At least three dozen leftists
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Europe, the workers who are usually commemorated on
May Day took a back seat to the far right, as neo-Nazis rallied in
German cities and nationalist parties held demonstrations in
France.
</P>
<P>
   There were also May Day protests in the United States. Police in
riot gear broke up a protest by hundreds of workers rights
supporters in downtown Portland, Ore. In Olympia, Wash., several
hundred demonstrators blocked one of the city's busiest
intersections to protest global corporations. And in New York City,
more than 1,000 immigrants protested outside City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The riots erupted in London when a group broke away from a
peaceful demonstration held by protesters planting seeds in front
of the Houses of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators threw stones and other objects near Prime Minister
Tony Blair's official residence at Downing Street, where a dozen
officers in riot gear took up positions. The protesters then
stormed a nearby branch of McDonald's, breaking windows, tearing
down the large ''M'' sign and distributing food.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators tried unsuccessfully to storm St. Martin's in
the Field Church, daubed anti-war slogans on the Cenotaph war
memorial and defaced a statue of Churchill by putting red paint on
his mouth to look like blood and spraying the communist symbol on
his jacket.
</P>
<P>
   They also covered the lower part of Nelson's Column, the slender
white tower that anchors Trafalgar Square, with anarchy symbols and
scrawled ''Reclaim the Streets 2000'' across it.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness began to fall, 2,000 protesters corralled in the
square were allowed to leave, resulting in more violence. They
smashed car windows and severely damaged several businesses before
being pushed across the Waterloo Bridge to the south bank of the
Thames, where authorities once again penned them in.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people responsible for the damage caused in London today
are an absolute disgrace,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To deface the Cenotaph and the statue of Winston Churchill is
simply beneath contempt. It is only because of the bravery and
courage of our war dead that these idiots can live in a free
country at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Three police officers and nine civilians were taken to the
hospital and nine other policemen suffered minor injuries.
Ninety-five people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In Manchester, northwest England, police said 200 demonstrators
targeted various shops and offices with rocks and bottles, and at
one point brought the city's central tram system to a halt. Twenty
protesters were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Berlin, 1,200 neo-Nazis rallied in a depressed
eastern neighborhood. The young crowd, many with shaved heads,
waved German imperial flags and listened to speeches calling for
''Germany for Germans.'' There were no outbreaks of violence, as
police kept a group of more than 100 counter-demonstrators
separated. More than 100 people from both right- and left-wing
groups were detained.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,800 more neo-Nazis held rallies in other cities around
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In Hamburg, Germany, several hundred rioters threw stones, broke
windows and set bonfires early Monday, until the melee was broken
up by police using water cannons. Twenty-one police officers were
injured and 134 people arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Police used a water cannon against a Monday night march of 5,000
leftists through Berlin's Kreuzberg district after demonstrators
lit a barricade on fire and threw stones, bottles and fireworks.
Several dozen people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In France, 3,000 members of the far-right National Front party
marched to the Paris Opera House behind a woman on horseback
dressed as Joan of Arc, whom the anti-immigration party has adopted
as its patron saint.
</P>
<P>
   In an address in Rome, Pope John Paul blessed the world's
workers and appealed for rich nations to relieve poor ones of their
crushing debts, saying: ''Realities such as unemployment,
exploitation of minors and low wages persist and are even getting
worse in some parts of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions and mainstream leftist parties in Europe also used
the day to stage peaceful street rallies. Tens of thousands
gathered in Madrid and 15,000 demonstrated in Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's May Day celebrations were a mere shadow of the
Soviet-orchestrated extravaganzas. Only about 15,000 people in
Moscow joined a noncommunist trade union march. Most Russians took
the opportunity to head to the country.
</P>
<P>
   In South America's largest city, Sao Paulo, Brazil, hundreds of
thousands of people gathered to protest low wages and high
unemployment. Some 20,000 workers, students and leftist activists
marched through Ecuador's capital Quito, protesting the
government's plans to adopt the U.S. dollar as the official
currency.
</P>
<P>
   In China, most people had the day off and visited friends and
relatives, while 3,000 people named as ''model workers'' by the
communist government attended a flag-raising ceremony in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square.

<HEADLINE> Astros 5, Brewers 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Octavio Dotel combined with three relievers on
a two-hitter, and Mitch Meluskey went 2-for-4 with a two-run homer
and three RBIs to lead the Houston Astros over the Milwaukee
Brewers 5-0 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Woodard (0-4) extended his winless streak to 16 starts
since he beat Kansas City last July 16. Woodard, 0-7 in that span,
allowed three runs, nine hits and four walks in 5 2-3 innings
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Houston took three of four in the series, blanking the Brewers
twice. Milwaukee has been shut out three times this season.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel (1-2) retired his first 11 batters, striking out five,
before walking Jeromy Burnitz in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   His sixth strikeout ended the inning, but Tyler Houston broke up
the no-hit bid in the fifth with a one-out bunt single down the
third-base line. Dotel fielded the ball cleanly, but Houston just
beat the throw.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel retired the next two batters, then left because of a sore
left hip. He lowered his ERA from 5.04 to 4.20. He allowed just the
one hit, winning for the first time since beating Philadelphia in
relief for the New York Mets last Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Maddux held the Brewers hitless until Houston's two-out
double in the seventh. Jay Powell and Billy Wagner each followed
with a hitless inning.
</P>
<P>
   Meluskey hit a two-run homer in the second, his third homer of
the season, then added a single in the fourth following Daryle
Ward's bloop double and Richard Hidalgo's looping liner to center.
</P>
<P>
   Following Meluskey's hit, Tim Bogar grounded to third baseman
Jose Hernandez, who threw high to home, but Houston made a sweeping
tag on Hidalgo for the second out.
</P>
<P>
   Dotel sacrificed, Craig Biggio was intentionally walked to load
the bases and Roger Cedeno hit into an inning-ending fielder's
choice
</P>
<P>
   Houston added two runs in the ninth off Curtis Leskanic on
pinch-hitter Bill Spiers' RBI double and Hidalgo's sacrifice fly.
Hidalgo was 3-for-3 with three singles.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Brewers have not had a winning record in May since
going 17-14 in 1988. ... Brewers' RHP Rocky Coppinger was scheduled
for surgery Tuesday to repair a torn ulnar collateral ligament in
his right elbow. ... The crowd was considerably below the announced
figure of 7,247. There were never more than 20 fans in the
right-field bleachers.

the opener of the Grand Prix series.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very pleased that Skate America will again be in
Colorado Springs this year,'' said John LeFevre, USFSA executive
director. ''Skate America is the traditional start of each new

<HEADLINE> The Old Ballgame Has Changed  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CUNNIFF, AP Business Analyst
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- If you fail to comprehend the logic, if any, of
today's investor marketplace, where earnings don't matter and
volatility is routine, you are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you have very good company, the likes of Warren
Buffett, George Soros and Julian Robertson, equal in their
particular calling to the likes of Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth and Joe
DiMaggio in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett, Soros and Robertson made their living not in sports but
in money, and all three made it in the billions, Hall of Fame
numbers even in an age when some investors lose that much in a day.
</P>
<P>
   All three were trained in the old school, where you measured the
possibilities of hitting it big by means of time-tested standards,
such as price-earnings ratios, growth rates and management.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these things just don't seem to count now. Impressive
price-earnings ratios, or PEs, which once might have ranged between
15 and 25, now exceed 100 -- if there are any earnings at all.
Growth rates are hard to figure because a company may be less than
a year old. And management? Some are managed by kids with an idea
and a product but not much more.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, all three investors, along with many other
lesser players, have confessed to an inability to fathom what is
going on in today's marketplace, where old values seem not to
count.
</P>
<P>
   All three indicated in one way or another that today's volatile
marketplace can't be relied upon to perform as indicated by any
standard and simply wasn't worth losing billions in the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett, perhaps the savviest investor ever, never really joined
the new marketplace, explaining that he didn't understand the
behavior of high-tech stocks and wasn't particularly interested in
risking the money of his business, Berkshire Hathaway, on them.
Berkshire Hathaway suffered for it, underperforming the general
market last year before showing gains recently.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Robertson, whose multibillion Tiger Fund had
shrunk to a fraction of its former size, announced he was closing
it down, conceding he was out of touch with the times.
</P>
<P>
   And within the past week, and after performing poorly this year,
longtime aide Geoge Druckenmiller resigned from Soros' $8.2 billion
Quantum Fund, and Soros said he would take a less risky approach.
</P>
<P>
   While they differed in specifics, all three shared a deep belief
that markets were efficient and predictable, as they were perceived
to be in the past. They may not have been as efficient as believed,
but at least you could assess some degree of risk and take a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   When new stocks departed from the old standards, old-time
investors avoided them. For a time. But the lore of stocks that
rose simply because they were rising was enticing. Even the best of
the old school were lured into the trap.
</P>
<P>
   With the old standards of quality suspended in deference to
companies with no history but a good idea, and no earnings but
simply the potential for them, stocks become ever more volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Volatility that pushes a stock to the heavens and then plummets
it to the depths is hardly the environment for old-time investors,
as opposed to speculators.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a fastball and getting a curve, not knowing were
the strike zone is supposed to be, and uncertain about the
umpiring, they strike out.

<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Ray Allen was hit in the head and required two
stitches late in the third quarter of Game 4 of the Milwaukee
Bucks' first-round series with the Indiana Pacers on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:24 left in the third quarter, Indiana's Jalen Rose
grabbed a rebound and swung his right arm behind him, hitting Allen
squarely above the right eye. Allen dropped to the floor and rolled
around, then stood and walked a few steps before lying down again.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates Mirsad Turkcan and Robert Traylor carried him to the
locker room. Bucks spokesperson Cheri Hanson said Allen received
two stitches on a cut above his eye and would be available to
return to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee didn't seem likely to need him. The Bucks, who trailed
2-1 in the best-of-series series, were up 83-60 at the time and led
88-62 after three quarters.

<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Todd Helton became the sixth player in Colorado
Rockies history to hit three home runs in a game, connecting three
times against the Montreal Expos on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who has nine multi-homer games in three seasons, hit a
pair of two-run homers off Expos starter Dustin Hermanson and added
a solo shot off Anthony Telford in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Helton joined Kevin Elster of the Los Angles Dodgers and
Seattle's Alex Rodriguez as the three players to hit three homers
in a game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Castilla, now with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, was the last
Colorado player to go deep three times. He did it last June 5
against Milwaukee at Coors Field.

<HEADLINE> Bucks 100, Pacers 87  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The Milwaukee Bucks are going back to Indiana
with a chance to advance in the playoffs for the first time in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Allen scored 20 points before taking a blow to the head, and
reserve Scott Williams added 20 as the hot-shooting Bucks routed
the Indiana Pacers 100-87 Monday night in Game 4 of their
best-of-five series.
</P>
<P>
   Game 5 is Thursday night at Conseco Fieldhouse, where the Bucks
already have won twice this season.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee is hoping to become the third No. 8 seed to upset a
top-seeded team. When Denver upset Seattle in 1994 and the Knicks
beat the Heat last year, both eighth-seeded teams won on the road
in a fifth game.
</P>
<P>
   In grand style, Milwaukee won a home playoff game for the first
time since May 1, 1990 -- the last year they got out of the first
round of the playoffs. The Bucks shot 64 percent in the first half
and led by double digits throughout the final three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   They were led by inspired efforts from Allen, Sam Cassell and
Glenn Robinson. For the first time, Milwaukee's Big Three played up
to its enormous potential in a critical postseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell scored just six points, but had a career playoff high 13
assists while running the Bucks' fluid offense to perfection.
Robinson had nine of his 18 points in the third quarter as the
Bucks kept the blowout going.
</P>
<P>
   Allen left the game and needed two stitches after Jalen Rose
inadvertently hit him while rebounding with 1:24 left in the third
quarter. The injury wasn't serious.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another scorching start put the Bucks in control early.
Shooting 73 percent in the game's first 18 minutes, Milwaukee led
by 25 points early in the second quarter and was up 64-37 at
halftime.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 15, Expos 8  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Todd Helton became the sixth player in Colorado
history to hit three homers in a game, going 4-for-5 with five RBIs
to lead the Rockies over the Montreal Expos 15-8 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Walker and Jeffrey Hammonds also connected for the
Rockies, and the teams tied a Coors Field record with 10 homers.
The Rockies and New York Mets scored 61 runs in three games over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who has nine career multihomer games in three seasons --
four against Montreal -- hit a pair of two-run homers off starter
Dustin Hermanson (3-2) and added a solo shot off Anthony Telford in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Kevin Elster of the Los Angles Dodgers and Alex
Rodriguez of the Mariners in hitting three homers in a game this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Widger hit two solo homers and Peter Bergeron added his
first career home run for the Expos, who lost for only the fourth
time in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Helton's second homer of the game -- a liner off Hermanson (3-2)
-- gave the Rockies an 8-7 lead in the fifth. Walker added a two-run
shot as part of a six-run sixth that gave Colorado a seven-run
cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe White (1-0) retired all three hitters he faced in relief of
starter Jarvis White, and Colorado's battered bullpen had its best
showing of the homestand, allowing one run -- a solo homer to
Rondell White -- in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal battled back from a 5-1 deficit as Widger hit a solo
homer leading off the fourth and Bergeron tied the game with a
three-run shot into the bullpen behind right-center field.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Vidro and Widger hit back-to-back homers in the fifth to
take a brief lead before the Rockies chased Hermanson in the bottom
half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The home-run barrage marked the fourth time 10 homers have
been hit in a game at Coors field. ... Hermanson gave up eight runs
in 4 1-3 innings as his ERA jumped to 4.12 from 2.57. He had
allowed two runs in his previous 24 innings. ... Montreal starters
had gone at least six innings in eight straight games. .... Helton
was 0-for-7 in his career against Hermanson before hitting his
first two homers. ... Colorado RHP Rolando Arrojo, who is on the
disabled list with a strained hamstring, threw 60 pitches in a
simulated game Monday and is expected to return to the starting
rotation Saturday in San Francisco. ... White made his first start
in three games since being hit in the left knee with a pitch.

<HEADLINE> Major Papers Post Circulation Gains  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Larger newspapers fared better than smaller ones
in the latest biannual survey of circulation data by the Audit
Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the ten largest papers reported circulation increases
for the six months ended March 31, but smaller papers continued to
show declines, in keeping with a recent trend, ABC reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times had the largest percentage gain among the
top dailies, climbing 5 percent in weekday circulation to
1,153,706, edging it ahead of The New York Times as the
third-largest paper in the country. The New York Times rose 1.3
percent to 1,149,576.
</P>
<P>
   The top two spots continued to be occupied by USA Today at
1,837,802 and The Wall Street Journal at 1,812,590. Both figures
were up 1.1 percent over the same six-month period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Total weekday circulation edged up 0.2 percent among the nearly
800 newspapers reporting figures to the Audit Bureau, according to
an analysis of the data done by the Newspaper Association of
America, an industry group. Sunday circulation slipped 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The latest survey came six months after USA Today edged out The
Wall Street Journal for the first time as the largest daily
newspaper in the nation. USA Today is published by Gannett Co., and
the Journal by Dow Jones &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Several newspaper publishers have been seeking changes in the
way the Audit Bureau records circulation figures, including
disclosure of how many copies are sold below the regular price or
given away for promotional purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes being sought is the removal of the ''50
percent rule,'' which prevents newspapers and other publications
from counting as paid circulation any copies that are sold for less
than half of their set price, either on newsstands or by
subscription.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones, which hires the accounting firm
PriceWaterhouseCoopers to audit its circulation data, maintains
that The Wall Street Journal is still the newspaper that is paid
for by more readers than any other. USA Today is often distributed
to guests in hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Audit Bureau figures, larger newspapers tended
to fare better than smaller ones. Eight of the 10 largest papers in
the country all had circulation gains, the only exceptions being
the New York Daily News and the Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver papers both posted large gains in circulation thanks
to a continuing promotional battle. The Denver Rocky Mountain News
had Monday through Saturday circulation of 446,465, up 25.4
percent, while The Denver Post rose 11.7 percent to 413,730.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, newspapers with circulation over 500,000 had an average
gain of 1.3 percent in circulation, according to the Newspaper
Association, while newspapers with circulations between 250,000 and
half a million rose 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller newspapers had slight declines. Papers with circulations
between 100,000 and 249,999 fell 0.01 percent, and circulations
between 50,000 and 99,999 fell 0.8 percent. Newspapers with
circulations between 25,000 and 49,999 fell 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday circulation was a sore spot for the industry, with
overall circulation slipping 0.6 percent and only one-third of the
601 reporting newspapers showing gains in circulation.

<HEADLINE> Fed OKs Schwab Purchase  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve has approved big online
broker Charles Schwab Corp.'s purchase of old-line bank U.S. Trust
Corp., the financial industry's first major melding of old and new
in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Monday was 5-0 by the central bank's board of
governors, who determined that the acquisition of U.S. Trust by the
nation's largest discount and online brokerage would not threaten
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition was made possible by landmark legislation
enacted in November removing Depression-era barriers and allowing
banks, securities firms and insurance companies to get into each
other's businesses. It is the first major transaction since the new
law took effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''Based on all the facts of record, the board concludes that
consummation of the proposal would not result in any significantly
adverse effects on competition or on the concentration of banking
resources in any relevant banking market,'' the Fed said in its
order.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in several states still must approve the transaction,
but those clearances are expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're gratified by the Fed's decision,'' said Schwab spokesman
Glen Mathison.
</P>
<P>
   But Matthew Lee, executive director of Inner City
Press/Community on the Move, which had criticized U.S. Trust's
record of lending to low- and moderate-income people, assailed the
central bank's approval of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Fed governors' action showed how the new financial
services law, combined with ''the Fed's lax approach to enforcing
the Community Reinvestment Act, can allow a major financial
conglomerate to nearly-entirely evade the letter and spirit of the
(reinvestment act), which is to serve the credit needs of low- and
moderate-income areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal announced by the two companies in January, San
Francisco-based Schwab will buy U.S. Trust for $2.9 billion in
stock. The transaction is expected to be completed by July.
</P>
<P>
   While 25-year-old Schwab already has captured a big chunk of the
booming retail-investor market, it will be able to tap wealthy
investors through its purchase of New York-based U.S. Trust,
purveyor of investment advice and private banking services to some
of America's richest families since 1853.
</P>
<P>
   The move was designed to fill existing gaps in both Schwab's and
U.S. Trust's current gamut of services, company officials have
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its market power, Schwab was unable to meet the needs of
its wealthiest clients, according to company founder and co-chief
executive Charles R. Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy investors, meanwhile, have shown an increased desire to
participate in the online investing revolution sweeping Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The companies estimate there are more than 6 million U.S.
households with a net worth exceeding $1 million, and that the
number of Americans with large investment portfolios is expected to
grow at a double-digit pace in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Millionaires currently comprise just 5 percent of Schwab's 6.4
million customers, while U.S. Trust's core customers have more than
$5 million each to invest.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to private banking services such as checking
accounts, credit lines and mortgage loans, U.S. Trust, which has
about $5 billion in assets, also helps clients create trust funds
to pass on their considerable wealth to the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, with some $29 billion in assets, now will be able to
offer those services through its U.S. Trust unit.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies will retain their separate brand identities.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Homers in San Francisco Bay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds became the first player to
homer into the water at San Francisco's new bayside ballpark Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds drove the first pitch from New York's Rich Rodriguez over
the right-field wall and into McCovey Cove where it was quickly
fished out of the water with a net by Joseph Figone, a member of
the grounds crew at the Giants' old ballpark on Candlestick Point.
</P>
<P>
   Figone was cruising McCovey Cove in a raft and was in the right
place at the right time. The crowd erupted when the ball sailed
into the bay and brought Bonds out for a bow after the three-run
shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants celebrated the milestone by shooting off water
cannons over the right-field wall and putting up the number one on
a scoreboard designating splashdowns in the bay.
</P>
<P>
   In an exhibition game against the Yankees, Bonds hit a ball that
bounced off the pier-side walkway and into the bay.

<HEADLINE> Marlins 5, Padres 2  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Preston Wilson hit a two-run homer and an RBI
double, and pitcher Ryan Dempster doubled and scored as the Florida
Marlins beat the San Diego Padres 5-2 Monday night to stop a
five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's homer was the 10th given up by right-hander Woody
Williams, tying him with Houston's Jose Lima for the most allowed
in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres have given up 27 runs on 10 homers in their last six
games, four of them by Williams. He allowed three homers in his
previous start, including a grand slam, but didn't figure in the
decision in a 9-8 loss at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, swept by the Atlanta Braves during the weekend, are
on their first four-game losing streak of the season and have lost
six of their last seven.
</P>
<P>
   With Dave Berg aboard on a single, Wilson homered to right with
two outs in the first, his third. After the Padres pulled to 3-2 in
the eighth, Wilson doubled in Cliff Floyd in the ninth. Floyd
scored on Derrek Lee's single, which chased Williams (3-2).
</P>
<P>
   With the Marlins leading 3-1 in the eighth, Dempster (2-2) was
chased by consecutive one-out singles by Dave Magadan and Eric
Owens. Ryan Klesko singled to right off Vic Darensbourg, just the
second hit by a left-hander in 16 at-bats against the lefty
reliever, to score Dave Newhan pinch-running for Magadan. Right
fielder Mark Kotsay threw out Owens at third on a close play.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster held the Padres to seven hits and two runs in 7 1-3
innings. He struck out eight and walked two. Williams allowed five
runs and nine hits in 8 1-3 innings, the longest outing by a Padres
pitcher this year. He struck out five and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Alfonseca pitched the ninth for his ninth save.
</P>
<P>
   Dempster doubled leading off the sixth for his first hit of the
year, took third on Kotsay's groundout and scored on Floyd's single
to right for a 3-1 lead. Until that at-bat, Dempster had been
5-for-74 (.068) lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Williams doubled and scored on Owens' double in the third.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Owens crashed into the fence in center after catching Lee's
fly ball in the seventh, hitting his right side against a padded
upright. Owens started to throw the ball back in, but pulled back,
apparently in pain, and flipped the ball to RF Kory DeHaan to throw
in. Owens stayed in the game. ... The Padres started retooling
their shaky bullpen on Monday by optioning right-hander Will
Cunnane to Triple-A Las Vegas and recalling right-hander Buddy
Carlyle. The Padres hope to have RHP Donne Wall (tendinitis)
available by Tuesday night, and will activate RHP Rodney Myers on
Friday if his rehab assignment at Class A Rancho Cucamonga goes
well. ... Dempster didn't factor in the decision in his last two
starts despite allowing just three earned runs over 13 2-3 innings.
Both games went extra innings, with the Marlins beating Pittsburgh
and losing to San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> 2 Charged In Murder of Rabbi's Wife  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Two men were arrested Monday night and
charged in the murder-for-hire of the wife of a prominent rabbi,
who was earlier charged in the killing. One of the men has admitted
to his role as a go-between, his attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Jenoff, 54, and Paul M. Daniels, 26, were charged with
murder and conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the
killing of Carol Neulander, Prosecutor Lee Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, 52, was bludgeoned to death on Nov. 1, 1994, in her
Cherry Hill home. Investigators say she was killed by a hitman
posing as a deliveryman.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff's attorney told the Courier-Post of Cherry Hill for
Tuesday's editions that his client has admitted that ''he was the
intermediary between the rabbi and someone who would kill his
wife,'' attorney Francis J. Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman said his client recruited Daniels for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman said Jenoff called the prosecutor and met with him
Friday because he felt remorse about Carol Neulander's death.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Rabbi Fred J. Neulander, said he found her body
when he returned from Congregation M'Kor Shalom synagogue. Her
purse was missing, but no other valuables were touched.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander was indicted in January 1999 on charges of accomplice
murder and conspiracy to commit murder. He is free on bail awaiting
his trial, which is scheduled to begin in June.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff and Daniels were being held in the Camden County Jail
Monday night. It was unclear whether Daniels had an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said Neulander had his wife of 29 years killed
so that he could continue his extramarital affair with Philadelphia
radio personality Elaine Soncini.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander allegedly thought divorce would jeopardize his
position as senior rabbi at the synagogue, which he founded with
his wife in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Soncini admitted having a two-year affair with Neulander that
ended shortly after his wife's killing. She has not been charged
with any wrongdoing.

   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Ray Allen scored 20 points before taking a blow to the
head, and reserve Scott Williams added 20 as the hot-shooting Bucks routed the
Indiana Pacers 100-87 Monday night in Game 4 of their best-of-five series. Game
5 is Thursday night at Conseco Fieldhouse, where the Bucks already have won
twice this season. Milwaukee is hoping to become the third No. 8 seed to upset a
top-seeded team. When Denver upset Seattle in 1994 and the Knicks beat the Heat
last year, both eighth-seeded teams won on the road in a fifth game.

<HEADLINE> MP3.com CEO: Settlement likely in copyright infringement case  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- MP3.com was trying to hit the right notes in
negotiations with major record companies even before a judge ruled
that the Internet-based music service violates their copyrights,
MP3.com's chief executive says.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been in heavy negotiations for weeks,'' said Michael
Robertson, MP3.com's chief executive officer, in a telephone
interview Monday from the headquarters of the San Diego-based
company.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was cautiously optimistic that the talks, which began
a month ago, would ultimately resolve the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say that we have two very motivated parties,'' he
said. ''We're relatively close in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments came after U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff ruled
Friday that MP3.com is liable for offering music online without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   The company lets users listen to music on the MP3.com Web site
from compact discs they already own. The record companies
challenged the practice, saying MP3.com violated copyrights by
loading CDs onto computer servers and letting customers download
them.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the judge issued a three-page order setting a
schedule for how the case will proceed, with an Aug. 28 date for a
trial of any remaining issues in the case, including damages.
</P>
<P>
   But he froze the exchange of evidence in the case through May 25
to give the parties an opportunity for any settlement discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Forrest, a lawyer for plaintiff Warner Brothers
Records Inc., referred calls to the Recording Industry Association
of America, a trade association for the major music labels
representing 90 percent of signed artists.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Maloni, a spokesman for the organization, declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   A source familiar with the talks, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said there was nothing to indicate the record companies
were close to a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson, though, said the talks were in ''fifth gear'' even
when the judge issued his one-page ruling Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He said a settlement was in the interests of both sides,
including record companies interested in licensing their content in
new ways.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he said, MP3.com and the companies were trying to
accomplish something that was unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one in the world has ever gotten a worldwide licensing
agreement for the entire record catalogue,'' he said. ''It would be
a monumental licensing deal if we are able to bring it to
fruition.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Sandler, a spokesman for The National Academy of Recording
Arts &AMP; Sciences, said the trade organization for songwriters and
producers would be pleased with a deal that forces MP3.com to pay
for its music.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't close the door to the barn so you might as well make
it feasible for these people to pay for the use,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said MP3.com ''had demonstrated it's a good marketing
vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is whether they are going to pay money that will
eventually flow to the songwriters and artists and publishers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If settlement talks break down, Robertson said, the company
would not be doomed. He said it still seemed on track, as analysts
predict that it will become profitable in the first quarter of
2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of our revenues are tied to the technology in legal
question. No revenues of note are being generated through that
service,'' he said, noting that the service accounts for only 4
percent of the company's business.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson likened his company's current court battle to that
faced by companies during the introduction of other technologies
such as cable television, cassette recorders and the video cassette
recorder.
</P>
<P>
   He said settlement negotiations were focusing on payments to
record companies that would still allow his company to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think both parties are really motivated to make it a
realistic number,'' he said. ''The content we're talking about is
only the CDs that you've already bought. It doesn't make sense to
tax the hell out of consumers, especially the ones who are buying
CDs, and say, 'You have to pay again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the upbeat talk by Robertson, he acknowledged there were
critics predicting the demise of his company because of the judge's
ruling, including a friend who offered to send over canned food so
they could eat.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hanging in there,'' he said with a chuckle.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warships Near Vieques Island  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Helicopters hovered overhead and
U.S. warships loomed offshore Vieques Island amid reports that
federal agents were planning to evict protesters from a contested
U.S. Navy bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions increased Monday with reports that the USS Nashville
and USS Bataan picked up 1,000 Marines in North Carolina en route
to Vieques. The Marines reportedly would secure the range's
perimeter once protesters are removed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to fight with them,'' said Luisa Guadalupe, 82,
a protester helping to block the main entrance to the Vieques
range. ''But to get me out of here they're going to have to arrest
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Navy exercises that had been held for 60 years on the island,
just east of Puerto Rico, were suspended a year ago after stray
bombs killed a civilian security guard, releasing pent-up
resentment in the U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   There are 50 protesters at several camps inside the range. They
stand in the way of an agreement between the local government and
President Clinton allowing the Navy to resume limited training
until Vieques' 9,300 residents decide in a referendum whether the
Navy should leave.
</P>
<P>
   Arrests would be carried out by federal agents in an FBI-led
operation, according to Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, three U.S. warships appeared off Vieques' north
coast, accompanied by two Coast Guard vessels. The hull number on
one of them was 13, corresponding to that of the USS Nashville, an
amphibious transport. The Bataan is an amphibious assault ship.
</P>
<P>
   The warships later steamed off to nearby Roosevelt Roads Naval
Station on the main island of Puerto Rico. An Army barge,
meanwhile, delivered Puerto Rican riot police vans to Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Several Navy helicopters flew over the range.
</P>
<P>
   Most protesters planned to surrender peacefully. But a few
threatened to scatter into the bomb-littered bush, raising the
specter of a dangerous hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters also say they will cut through fences and ride in by
horseback to replace any demonstrators who are arrested.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 people gathered outside the range's main gate late
Monday. Some played dominoes or read books. Others posed for
pictures in front of a giant sign reading ''378 days of peace taken
back from the oppressor!'' A few jeered as a Humvee carrying five
soldiers drove by.
</P>
<P>
   They kept a box of rags, ready to soak them in a water-vinegar
mixture to minimize the effects of tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Local politicians arrived to reinforce the gate camp and said
arrests would anger Puerto Ricans in New York, Florida and Chicago
-- much as the Justice Department raid to seize Elian Gonzalez from
his relatives' home in Miami enraged the Cuban-American community
there.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be worse than Miami for the Clinton
administration,'' said Jose Aponte, a prominent Puerto Rican
Democrat and the mayor of Carolina, a San Juan suburb. ''Arrests
are not going to end the fight. They are going to extend it to the
rest of Puerto Rico and big cities in the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Vieques Protesters Vow To Fight US  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS HAWLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The scene is familiar: a crowd of
determined demonstrators talking worriedly in Spanish, fears of a
nighttime raid by federal authorities, threats of a political
backlash and a nationwide wave of civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. authorities show signs of marshaling their forces to
arrest protesters on the U.S. Navy bombing range on Vieques Island,
comparisons to unrest surrounding the Elian Gonzalez case in Miami
buzzed through protest camps.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the case of that young boy in Miami, the issue ended with
the arrests. Here the problem will start with the arrests,'' said
Ruben Berrios, the Puerto Rican Independence Party leader who has
spent nearly a year camped on the Navy's bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, protesters outside the gate of the range said they
feared pepper spray would be used, as it was in the raid to seize
Elian from his Miami relatives' home. They kept a box of rags at
hand, ready to soak them in water and vinegar to minimize the
effects of the spray.
</P>
<P>
   Local politicians who arrived to reinforce the camp promised a
backlash against the Clinton administration by the sizable Puerto
Rican populations in New York, Florida and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is going to be worse than Miami for the Clinton
administration,'' said Jose Aponte, a prominent Puerto Rican
Democrat and the mayor of Carolina, a San Juan suburb. ''Arrests
are not going to end the fight. They are going to extend it to the
rest of Puerto Rico and big cities in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Activist Robert Rabin said: ''These arrests will only begin a
new chapter here. Any attempt at intervention will touch off civil
disobedience around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months there have been marches and demonstrations in
Washington and New York. On Monday, the New York-based Vieques
Support Campaign announced a protest in Times Square the day after
any arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will show them that Vieques is not alone,'' a statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   Berrios was optimistic that President Clinton might call off the
expected raid. ''Calmer minds have prevailed for one year,''
Berrios said. ''It would surprise me if the warmonger minds prevail
now.''

<HEADLINE> Two men charged in murder-for-hire of rabbi's wife  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Two men were arrested Monday night and
charged in the murder-for-hire of the wife of a prominent rabbi,
who was earlier charged in the killing. One of the men has admitted
to his role as a go-between, his attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Jenoff, 54, and Paul M. Daniels, 26, were charged with
murder and conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the
killing of Carol Neulander, Prosecutor Lee Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, 52, was bludgeoned to death on Nov. 1, 1994, in her
Cherry Hill home. Investigators say she was killed by a hitman
posing as a deliveryman.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff's attorney told the Courier-Post of Cherry Hill for
Tuesday's editions that his client has admitted that ''he was the
intermediary between the rabbi and someone who would kill his
wife,'' attorney Francis J. Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman said his client recruited Daniels for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman said Jenoff called the prosecutor and met with him
Friday because he felt remorse about Carol Neulander's death.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Rabbi Fred J. Neulander, said he found her body
when he returned from Congregation M'Kor Shalom synagogue. Her
purse was missing, but no other valuables were touched.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander was indicted in January 1999 on charges of accomplice
murder and conspiracy to commit murder. He is free on bail awaiting
his trial, which is scheduled to begin in June.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor's spokesman Greg Reinert said Jenoff is a friend of
the rabbi. A private investigator, Jenoff was hired by Neulander to
work on the case. Jenoff knew Daniels, Reinert said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Wixted and Jeffrey Zucker, Neulander's attorneys, said
the rabbi was shocked when he learned of the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   They said Jenoff had repeatedly said under oath that Neulander
was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he's changed his tune, we'll have to wait and see why,''
Wixted told FOX-TV in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the very beginning of this, he's always been on the
rabbi's side and always said he had nothing to do with it,'' Zucker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said a hearing on the case is scheduled for May 9 with
Superior Court Judge Linda G. Rosenzweig.
</P>
<P>
   ''My belief is we should (meet) with the judge to get an idea of
where we stand with respect to the trial,'' Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff and Daniels were being held in the Camden County Jail on
Monday night. It was unclear whether Daniels had an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Hartman said Jenoff had hoped for a plea agreement or even
immunity in exchange for his cooperation, but Solomon was ''not
hearing anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff and Daniels were scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in
state Superior Court in Camden.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said Neulander had his wife of 29 years killed
so that he could continue his extramarital affair with Philadelphia
radio personality Elaine Soncini.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander thought divorce would jeopardize his position as
senior rabbi at the synagogue, which he founded with his wife in
1974.
</P>
<P>
   Soncini admitted having a two-year affair with Neulander that
ended shortly after his wife's killing. She has not been charged
with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Soncini has told authorities that Neulander told her that their
problem would be solved by December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander stepped down from his synagogue post in February 1995
after reports of his affairs with two congregants. He was later
suspended by a rabbinical panel.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Talks Recess  </HEADLINE>
By DANA BUDEIRI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EILAT, Israel (AP) -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators took a
daylong break today from peace talks that have made little
progress, choosing to await the arrival of a U.S. envoy to help
bridge the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's session was marked by attempts at good will, with
Israeli officials acknowledging Palestinian statehood as inevitable
and the Palestinians expressing sympathy for Israel's pain on
Holocaust Remembrance Day, the reason for today's recess.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive later at this Red Sea port
to help push along the negotiations that have so far revealed
''large differences,'' according to Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations are trying to produce a framework agreement for
a final peace treaty, ostensibly by the end of the month, though
both sides have expressed doubt that the deadline will be met. The
treaty itself is due by September.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators are to reach a deal on the scope of a third and
final interim Israeli troop pullout from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat said Israel had offered too little land. The two sides
disagree over the size of the Jewish settlements and military and
border areas that Israel may retain in the pullback.
</P>
<P>
   The thorniest issues -- Palestinian refugees, settlements, final
borders and the fate of Jerusalem, claimed by both sides as their
capital -- remain unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Amid Palestinian anger over plans to expand the Jewish West Bank
settlement of Maaleh Adumim, a close aide to Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Israel would not oppose a Palestinian state in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon said Monday that a Palestinian state
already existed, de facto, and that negotiators would discuss its
parameters. He said, however, that the Palestinians should accept
that some Jewish settlements, including Maaleh Adumim, would be
annexed to Israel as part of the final treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat denounced the settlement
expansion in an area where the Palestinians hope to establish their
state and said the construction was negatively affecting peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo, meanwhile, offered
Israelis words of support for Holocaust Memorial Day, which began
Monday evening and ends today after sundown.
</P>
<P>
   ''We share with the Israeli people the feeling of pain and
sorrow on this day, a day of tragedy in Jewish history,'' Yasser
Abed Rabbo told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is sensitive. Many Palestinians feel Israel demands
sympathy because of the tragedy of the Holocaust, but ignores the
suffering of Palestinians displaced from their homes and homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ''We also want our days of tragedy to become a distant memory
and to put an end to the suffering of the Palestinian people that
has lasted until today,'' Abed Rabbo went on to say.

<HEADLINE> Anger Linked to Heart Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By TROY GOODMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- People who are highly anger-prone are nearly three
times more likely to have heart attacks than those who aren't,
according to researchers who studied nearly 13,000 adults.
</P>
<P>
   The connection held true even after researchers took into
account other major risk factors such as high blood pressure, high
cholesterol, smoking and obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The implications of our study are that anger could potentially
lead to heart attacks, especially among middle-aged men and women
with normal blood pressure,'' said Janice Williams, an
epidemiologist in Atlanta who led the study while at the University
of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have shown that stress hormones constrict blood
vessels and may trigger a blockage in the arteries. The study adds
to previous research showing a link between heart health and
depression, hostility and other emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The latest findings appear in Monday's issue of Circulation, a
journal of the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the study, the adults were followed for six years.
All were interviewed before they had a heart attack. That minimized
the possibility that their anger was produced by their heart
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Anger was measured with a 10-question survey asking people such
things as whether they felt they were hotheaded, did they feel like
hitting someone when they got angry or did they feel annoyed when
they were not given recognition for doing good work.
</P>
<P>
   The survey ranked people low, moderate or high in
anger-proneness and found those in the high category were 2.7 times
more likely than those in the low category to have a heart attack
or die of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Federici, a cardiologist with Lovelace Health System
in Albuquerque, N.M., said the findings prove that emotions like
anger and stress have a great deal to do with a person's risk of
heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''It goes along with other studies that show depression and
other emotions are very clearly related to the disease process,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Preemies Survive More Than Thought  </HEADLINE>
By KATE N. GROSSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Many premature babies may not be getting proper
care because doctors tend to underestimate the babies' odds of
survival and overestimate their chances of a serious handicap,
according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   Normal gestation is 39 weeks. A baby born at 37 weeks of
gestation or earlier is considered premature, and preemies
accounted for about 11.5 percent of the approximately 3.9 million
babies born in the United States in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to the study, the survival rate for a baby delivered
at 28 weeks is 84 percent. But the obstetricians surveyed thought
it was only 58 percent, while pediatricians estimated only 68
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of babies delivered at 28 weeks who are free of a
major handicap, including cerebral palsy, mental retardation and
developmental delay, is 89 percent. Obstetricians thought it was
only 58 percent. Pediatricians estimated 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this tells us is that we need to be more effective in
disseminating the most accurate information,'' said Dr. Steven
Morse, a neonatologist in private practice in Savannah, Ga., who
led the survey of 630 obstetricians and pediatricians.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were published in the May issue of the journal
Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   Obstetricians were asked what treatment they would use at 23
through 36 weeks for a woman in premature labor. Pediatricians were
asked about measures such as keeping a baby warm, attempting
resuscitation or using a respirator.
</P>
<P>
   Among pediatricians, optimists were 1.8 times more likely than
the pessimists to use respirators for infants between 23 and 27
weeks. Among obstetricians, optimists were 1.3 more times likely to
perform a Caesarean section for distress in infants between 23 and
25 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very important because terrible decisions can be made,''
said one researcher, Dr. James Haywood, a University of Alabama at
Birmingham neonatologist. ''I think we're at most risk of making a
poor decision when we have bad information.''
</P>
<P>
   Though an increasing number of babies and their mothers are
transferred to centers that specialize in premature babies, many
such infants are cared for by general obstetricians and
pediatricians.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers sent questionnaires to about 1,850 doctors
randomly selected from the directories of the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of
Pediatrics. Then pediatricians with a subspecialty practice were
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Morse said he believes doctors underestimate because they tend
to remember their worst premature cases. Haywood suggested that
doctors also may underestimate because neonatology is new and
constantly changing.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics on survival and handicaps are outdated, having
been collected between 1978 and 1989. But the researchers argued
that the prospects for premature babies have only improved since
then, possibly making the under- or overestimation more pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is very important that professionals and mothers understand
that the outcomes for very low birthweight babies are far better
than most people believe,'' said Dr. Michael Acarregui, an
assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Iowa who was
not involved in the study.

<HEADLINE> Strike doesn't cut off patients' lifeline  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARMINGTON, Conn. (AP) -- Sailors rolled up their sleeves for the
only blood drive held in Connecticut on the first full day of a
strike against the state chapter of the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   A blood drive at the U.S. Submarine Base in Groton Monday drew
52 units of blood, down drastically from the daily average of 600
units. Another drive is scheduled for today at the sub base, a
location chosen mostly for its security. The donors again will be
base personnel and the goal is 125 units, said Red Cross
spokeswoman Kathy Flaherty.
</P>
<P>
   She said the sub base collection was staffed by Red Cross
managers and five workers who crossed the picket line.
</P>
<P>
   Blood also crossed the picket line at Red Cross state
headquarters Monday morning, reaching hospitals despite the first
strike in 25 against the Connecticut chapter.
</P>
<P>
   By sunrise, lab workers at the University of Connecticut Medical
Center -- just a few hundred yards down the road from the Red Cross
collection center -- were logging in their first shipment of blood.
</P>
<P>
   The units were delivered by a Red Cross manager who needed a
little help with the paperwork. Other than that it was business as
usual, said Dr. Patricia Pisciotto, director of the health center
blood bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't really concerned about not getting our deliveries
on time. We knew (the Red Cross) would be getting blood in from
other regions,'' she said. ''My sense is that everything would go
along as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike involves about 200 workers who collect blood around
the state and deliver it to hospitals. The Red Cross says hospitals
will not run out of blood because any collection shortfall could be
made up from national resources.
</P>
<P>
   On strike are technician-drivers, nurses, phlebotomists (who
actually draw the donated blood) and lab workers. The workers,
represented by the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees, are unhappy over long hours, frequent schedule
changes and increasing health benefit costs.
</P>
<P>
   Union negotiator Jeffrey Jump said Monday that a federal
mediator wants to resume talks by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   At the UConn hospital, three lab technicians processed the day's
delivery and planned for another order later in the day. A bank of
refrigerated cases stored about 100 units of blood at 39 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Matching blood and patients can be challenging, especially when
it involves a rare blood type or multiple antibodies, said Dr.
Pisciotto.
</P>
<P>
   It takes just one unit to make Jim May feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed five years ago with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a cancer of
the white blood cells, the 51-year-old Plymouth man has spent the
last couple weeks in the health center's bone marrow ward. He had
hoped to spend the summer doing yard work.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're not feeling good, everything is bad,'' said May.
</P>
<P>
   He figures he's had about a dozen blood transfusions over the
last month. The red cells carry much-needed oxygen back into his
tissues.
</P>
<P>
   His last transfusion was Sunday, a few hours before the strike.
</P>
<P>
   He said within two hours of the transfusion, ''I can feel the
energy. It never fails to make me feel better -- guaranteed.''

<HEADLINE> Pediatrics Academy Issues ADHD Guide  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The nation's pediatricians are being asked to
take an active role in diagnosing attention deficit/hyperactivity
disorder amid concern that merely rambunctious children are being
given unnecessary medication.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics on Monday issued its first
guidelines for ADHD, hoping to eliminate incorrect diagnoses and
make sure untreated children get the help they need.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines are for children 6 through 12. Most ADHD research
has involved that age group, and the academy also said it
recognizes that some symptoms can be chalked up to normal
rambunctiousness and contrariness in preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   However, recent research shows dramatic increases in the use of
drugs like Ritalin to treat children with ADHD, suggesting the
disorder is either becoming more common or is being overdiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   The academy, the nation's largest group of pediatricians, said
it is unclear whether the disorder is being overdiagnosed, because
doctors' definitions and treatment of it varies widely.
</P>
<P>
   The academy said it believes the new guidelines will standardize
the diagnosis and make it easier to identify which children really
need help. Guidelines for treating ADHD are still being developed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to help us all (diagnose) more accurately,'' said
Dr. James Perrin, an author of the guidelines and an associate
professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Between 4 percent and 12 percent of school-age children -- or an
average of about 2.5 million, most of them boys -- are believed to
have ADHD. Symptoms include short attention span, impulsive
behavior and difficulty focusing and sitting still.
</P>
<P>
   Ritalin is often prescribed to increase a child's alertness. But
many experts have pointed out that its long-term effects on
children are unknown.
</P>
<P>
   For a diagnosis of ADHD under the new guidelines, a child must
exhibit symptoms in at least two settings, such as at home and at
school. The symptoms must harm the child's academic or social
functioning for at least six months.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time the academy has drawn up guidelines for a
behavioral ailment. The academy began developing them three years
ago, said Dr. Martin Stein, co-author and a pediatrics professor at
the University of California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines also suggest that pediatricians and family
doctors take a leading role in addressing the disorder, with
information about the child's behavior from parents and teachers.
Doctors also should use criteria from the American Psychiatric
Association's diagnostic manual of mental disorders.
</P>
<P>
   Involving pediatricians in the diagnosis of ADHD is ''really
exciting because they're seeing these kids more than child
psychiatrists,'' said Dr. Karen Pierce, a child psychiatrist in
Chicago who helped develop the standards. ''It will add a new
dimension and actually be able to help a lot more kids.''

<HEADLINE> Miami Appoints New Police Chief  </HEADLINE>
By MEG RICHARDS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Raul Martinez, a Cuban immigrant who spent 24 years
as a police officer, says it has been a lifelong dream to be
Miami's chief of police. He's taking the job at a crucial moment.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was appointed chief by embattled city manager Donald
Warshaw, who likely will be out of a job next week amid the
political turmoil, resignations and accusations following the Elian
Gonzalez raid.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has never before had a Hispanic police chief. The
appointment was made Monday, with the swearing-in ceremony
scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pledge to all of you, to be the chief of police for the
entire community,'' said Martinez, an assistant city manager who
came to the United States from Havana when he was 12. ''I ask that
we put away our differences and look at all the common things that
we have, and make this city a great city.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, 50, replaces William O'Brien, who resigned after Mayor
Joe Carollo fired Warshaw amid public fallout over the handling of
the April 22 federal raid on the home of Elian Gonzalez's relatives
and the protests that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo, angered that O'Brien had not notified him when he found
out federal agents were moving to reunite 6-year-old with his Cuban
father, demanded Warshaw fire the chief. Warshaw refused.
</P>
<P>
   Citing issues unrelated to the Gonzalez case, Carollo fired
Warshaw last week. Warshaw could keep his job if four of the five
city commissioners overrule Carollo. That vote was expected
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the city charter, Warshaw's firing does not take effect
for 10 days, which will be Sunday. The charter also specifies that
the city manager name the police chief, with no requirement the
mayor be consulted.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo has said he was against Warshaw hiring a new chief of
police, preferring to conduct a nationwide search for O'Brien's
replacement. Carollo did not return phone calls Monday seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's appointment comes the same day that Carollo accused
Warshaw of blackmailing him. Carollo also launched an investigation
into allegations that Warshaw misused city funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city manager sent an extortion demand to me that if I
fired him he would take me out as mayor,'' Carollo said. ''No city
manager should be allowed to extort a mayor in any city in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw denied that he misused funds and defended himself
against the mayor's other accusation. ''I'm not a blackmailer. I'm
not an extortionist,'' Warshaw said. ''I'm not really sure where
the mayor was going with that.''

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Woman Faces Execution  </HEADLINE>
By JAMIE STENGLE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The state of Arkansas is preparing to
execute its first female inmate in more than 150 years, a former
nurse who says she wants to die for suffocating her two children.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Marie Riggs, 28, would be the fifth woman executed
nationwide since the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a ban on capital
punishment in 1976. She is to die by injection tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs asked the jury to sentence her to death for the Nov. 5,
1997, slayings of Justin, 5, and Shelby Alexis, 2. Justin was
injected with potassium chloride and morphine and eventually
smothered; his sister was smothered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to die. I want to be with my babies. I want you to give
me the death penalty,'' she told jurors in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After her conviction, she pursued appeals at her family's
request but withdrew them this year after a judge ruled that she
could. The Arkansas Supreme Court later upheld her request.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mike Huckabee could grant an unlimited number of 30-day
reprieves, but cannot grant executive clemency to Riggs because she
has not asked for mercy, Huckabee spokesman Jim Harris said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International USA and the American Civil Liberties Union
have asked Huckabee to intervene to spare her life. The ACLU on
Monday said Riggs was mentally incompetent, though courts have
found her sane.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs admitted killing her children and claimed she was deeply
depressed at the time.
</P>
<P>
   A woman has never been executed under state authority, the
Arkansas Correction Department said, but Lavinia Burnett was hanged
in 1845 for being an accessory to murder. Counties handled
executions at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin Shipman, an Arkansas State University journalism
professor who has been studying capital punishment of women, said
society and government have often grappled with executing women.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things we saw was governors expressing a lot of
soul-searching and concern about executing a woman,'' he said.
''There was a pretty healthy debate as to whether women should have
a special place.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the concern dwindled as the women's equality movement
moved forward. Four other women have been executed nationwide since
1976, most recently Betty Lou Beets of Texas in February.
</P>
<P>
   In Riggs' case, prosecutors told jurors that her children had
become an inconvenience to her. They said she left the children by
themselves while she competed in karaoke contests and plotted their
deaths for two or three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Riggs' mother and lawyer said she suffered
post-traumatic stress after working as a nurse in the aftermath of
the Oklahoma City bombing. The matter was soon dropped and never
came up at her trial.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs worked at the Veterans Administration hospital in Oklahoma
City from 1990 to July 1995, but the hospital says she was not one
of the employees who was sent to the bomb site.

<HEADLINE> White House Holds Teen Conference  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite their loud sighs and complaints about
being misunderstood, teen-agers need and want their parents
involved in their lives, says first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,
who today hosts a White House conference on helping families
through the often-turbulent teen years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Studies are showing that for all their protest and swagger,
teen-agers need and want the everyday love, involvement and
discipline of their parents,'' Mrs. Clinton wrote in an article
about the conference published in this week's Newsweek. ''Sometimes
even modest efforts to reach out to your teen-ager can make a
tremendous difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents, teens, teachers, youth workers and others were invited
to the daylong conference to discuss ways to raise and mentor
responsible and resourceful youth.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was moderating two morning sessions, including one
on what parents and communities can do to help teens succeed.
Afternoon panel discussions were to address what can be done to
make it easier for parents to spend time together, media's impact
on youth and parenting and what parents, communities and young
people can do to avoid risky behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''Adults usually do not listen to young people and they don't
make it their business to help them implement their goals,'' said
panelist Dorothy Stoneman, founder of the Boston-based YouthBuild
USA, which teaches low-income young people construction skills by
building affordable housing in their communities. ''What happens
when you listen, young people get engaged and connected and they
feel better about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference also was highlighting recent brain research that
says the preteen years are as important in setting patterns for
adult behavior as the first three years of life.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists had believed that brain development slowed after the
first few years of life -- that the brain was essentially organized
by the time a child enters the first grade. The research, first
published late last year and then in the March issue of the journal
Nature, showed that in teen-agers up to age 15, there are peak
growth rates in areas of the brain associated with language and
associative thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes we give up on kids early and feel that they are
already doomed for certain fates, but from the biological
perspective there are still lots and lots of opportunities for
change during the teen years,'' said Dr. Jay Giedd, a National
Institute of Mental Health child psychiatrist who worked on the
research.

<HEADLINE> White House E-mail Furor Rages  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is suggesting it may invoke
executive privilege to prevent Congress from seeing some documents
in the controversy over missing e-mails that are being sought by
investigators looking into a range of matters from Whitewater to
campaign fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has sent the House Government Reform Committee a
one-page list of documents it is not immediately turning over to
investigators because they are considered covered by executive
privilege and attorney-client confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents on the list, which was obtained Monday by
The Associated Press, are handwritten notes by White House lawyers
involving discussions they had with computer experts about the
e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   The list says the notes ''reflect mental impressions'' of the
lawyers for the White House Office of Administration, which oversaw
the computer system that, because of a technical glitch, was not
properly archiving e-mails so they could be searched for possible
turnover to various investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Robert Ray, the Justice Department and
Congress are all investigating whether the White House's failure to
promptly recover e-mails and check them for compliance with a
number of subpoenas after the glitch was discovered in 1998 was
part of an effort to obstruct the investigations that have dogged
the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   The privilege list is the first step in the executive privilege
process. In past investigations ranging from impeachment to Puerto
Rican terrorists, the White House has sometimes relented and turned
over documents and in other cases invoked the privileges to shield
memos.
</P>
<P>
   Executive privilege, which became famous a quarter century ago
during the battle for Richard Nixon's audio tapes in the Watergate
scandal, refers to the right of a president to keep confidential
the advice he receives from aides on official matters.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's latest maneuver prompted an angry reply from
the chairman of the House Government Reform Committee
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House is obstructing the investigation,'' Rep. Dan
Burton, R-Ind., said in a letter to the White House counsel's
office. ''This meaningless legal mumbo-jumbo is obviously a
transparent ploy to provoke wasteful and time-consuming squabbles
over documents.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said presidential lawyers
''would like to reach an accommodation with the committee to
provide them with what they legitimately need in a way that doesn't
interfere with our ability to do our job.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have already turned over a lot of material to Mr. Burton,''
Kennedy said. ''What he is seeking is not historical information
about the origins of this problem but current information generated
only as a result of his inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's committee plans to hold hearings on the e-mails
Wednesday and Thursday. Among the witnesses lawmakers planned to
question was Karl Heissner, a White House aide who worked in the
Office of Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The AP reported Monday that Heissner wrote a memo divulging that
presidential aides prepared to notify Congress as early as February
1999 about the e-mail glitch and to begin retrieving thousands of
unarchived messages that might be relevant to investigators.
Instead, the White House waited another year before taking action.
</P>
<P>
   Heissner's memo also suggests he was reluctant to tell Congress
about the status of official document requests to the White House
because he believed such requests from investigators were
declining. ''Let sleeping dogs lie,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials blame a ''disconnect'' between their
technicians, who diagnosed the e-mail problem, and their lawyers,
who apparently did not understand that the glitch might affect
pending subpoena requests.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations, meanwhile, pressed forward.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's prosecutors plan to interview one of the White House
contractors involved in the discovery of the problem, Betty
Lambuth, according to Judicial Watch, the conservative legal group
that is representing her. Lambuth has alleged she was threatened by
White House officials not to divulge the problem.

<HEADLINE> Record Amount of Debt To Be Paid  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Flush with cash from a booming economy, the
Treasury expects to reduce the national debt by a record $216
billion this year, marking the third straight year of debt
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   For all of fiscal 1999, the government posted a record $88.3
billion reduction in debt held by the public. In 1998, it paid off
$51 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the end of this fiscal year, we will have reduced the debt
held by the public by more than $350 billion -- or almost 10 percent
-- in just three years,'' Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said debt reduction ''is one of the most
important investments in the future we can make.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter of this year, Summers said the government
expects to pay off $185 billion of debt -- a quarterly record -- up
from a previous estimate of $152 billion. The second quarter is
traditionally a period of big government debt payoffs because tax
payments flood federal coffers.
</P>
<P>
   The government can pay off debt through a combination of buying
back older, high-yielding securities before they mature and
reducing the amount newly issued.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Treasury said it would like to buy back up to $30
billion of debt this year. Summers said those plans haven't
changed.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Treasury has bought back $7 billion of
outstanding 30-year Treasury bonds that carry higher yields than
the current market yield on comparable securities. It paid sellers
roughly $1.8 billion in premiums to cash in early.
</P>
<P>
   The debt bought back thus far still is only a fraction of the
$5.7 trillion national debt. Of that total, $3.6 trillion is held
by the public.
</P>
<P>
   Bulging government surpluses -- helped along by a booming economy
that is generating lots of tax revenue -- is making it possible for
the Treasury to repurchase bonds and to reduce new issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is predicting a $166 billion surplus
for fiscal 2000. Last year, the government posted a record $124.4
billion surplus.

<HEADLINE> DioGuardi enters from the right  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSSINING, N.Y. (AP) -- Former Rep. Joseph DioGuardi may be a late
entry into the U.S. Senate race, but he says he's not worried about
catching up to the fund-raising totals of Rudolph Giuliani and
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need a lot more money than me,'' DioGuardi said Monday.
''They have to disguise who they are. She has to disguise that she
comes from Arkansas, he has to disguise that he believes in
partial-birth abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   The sudden candidacy of DioGuardi, a Republican who says
Giuliani is too liberal, endangers the mayor's grasp on the
conservative votes he may need to beat Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that Giuliani isn't conservative enough; he's not
conservative at all,'' DioGuardi said in announcing he would seek
the Conservative, Right to Life and Independence party lines on the
November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In close New York races -- the Giuliani-Clinton race is a
statistical tie, according to a Quinnipiac College Poll out Monday
-- small-party endorsements can mean victory. No Republican has won
a statewide race without the Conservative line since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, they're popping the champagne corks at Clinton
campaign headquarters,'' said GOP consultant and television
commentator Jay Severin, who is not involved in the race. ''You
could almost run a dead body on the Conservative line and attract
enough votes to defeat the Republican candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   DioGuardi, 59, of Ossining, said he expects to win the
Conservative and Right to Life nominations but realizes Giuliani is
the likely Republican candidate. He said his announcement had
nothing to do with the mayor's recent prostate cancer diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many people in New York who are not going to vote if
Giuliani and Clinton are the only choices,'' DioGuardi said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokeswoman Karen Dunn said the campaign had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he was confident he would win a Conservative Party
primary. But state party Chairman Michael Long, who has refused to
back Giuliani because of the mayor's support for abortion rights,
could probably block a primary if he settles on DioGuardi.
</P>
<P>
   Long called DioGuardi ''the right candidate'' Monday but held
off on any formal endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   He said DioGuardi could ''blow this into a three-way race'' by
taking votes ''from conservative-minded Democrats and also real
Republicans'' -- the very voters Giuliani is targeting.
</P>
<P>
   DioGuardi, who was born in the Bronx, was a two-term incumbent
who lost his seat in 1988 and failed again in congressional races
in 1992 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He is president of the Albanian American Civic League -- his
father emigrated from an Albanian village in Italy -- and was a
proponent of U.S. military action in Kosovo. He is a certified
public accountant.
</P>
<P>
   The former congressman said Giuliani is a competent mayor but
''hasn't shown any reason to think he can deal with foreign policy,
national security, military morale, any of the things you have to
do as a senator.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton, ''She's a moving van away from the most
scandal-scarred White House maybe in our history,'' DioGuardi said.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Try To Stay Within Budget  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tax and spending plans by Al Gore and George
W. Bush leave plenty of unanswered questions about how -- and
whether -- they can live within their own budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, their efforts have drawn plaudits from some budget
experts because it is the first time presidential contenders have
at least said they would use Social Security funds only to reduce
the debt or to buttress the huge pension program. Many economists
think using those funds for debt reduction is wise because it would
help push interest rates down and keep the economy strong.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a historical perspective, you'd give both candidates high
marks for fiscal prudence,'' said Robert Reischauer, president of
the Urban Institute and former chief of the Congressional Budget
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore both rely on projections of big federal surpluses
in coming years -- which could prove wrong if a major economic
downturn occurs.
</P>
<P>
   But if anything, both men should benefit when official forecasts
are updated this summer because most analysts expect the economic
boom to push projected surpluses higher still, leaving more money
for their proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates' budgets are more political platforms
than fiscal blueprints. Even so, both proposals omit key details
about where they would find budget savings and how much they would
need, raising questions about whether their plans are politically
feasible.
</P>
<P>
   By the Bush campaign's own numbers, the Republican's five-year
plan -- headlined by his $483 billion tax cut -- would clip Social
Security surpluses slightly and drain the entire surplus he
projects from the rest of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor projects a five-year, $586 billion surplus
from non-Social Security programs -- a number expected to rise when
the campaign releases a new estimate based on April federal tax
collections. But, using figures provided by aides, his tax cut plus
proposals to boost spending for health, schools, defense and other
programs would total $588.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That means Bush would use $2.6 billion of the nearly $1 trillion
in Social Security surpluses expected from 2002-2006, or about 0.26
percent. That figure has little budgetary significance, but
underlines the difficulty of leaving politically sacrosanct Social
Security money alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's balance,'' Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said of the
figures.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Bush's proposals could cost billions more
because his plan excludes the costs of lost interest savings, a new
Medicare prescription drug benefit, or other proposals. And to
arrive at his surplus forecast, Bush assumes the government will
spend tens of billions of dollars less annually than many lawmakers
of both parties believe is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say Bush will soon detail federal waste that could provide
additional savings.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would also use an unspecified amount of the Social Security
surplus to subsidize new, voluntary personal retirement accounts,
investments that would supplement traditional Social Security
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   He has provided no details on that. But one frequently discussed
plan on Capitol Hill cited by aides would use 2 percent of the
current 12.4 percent payroll tax that finances Social Security, or
about $85 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean less money for debt reduction. But Bush aides
say the higher return likely on such investments would mean better
overall retirement plans for Americans and less pressure on Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in an interview in today's editions of the Washington
Post, said the combination of Bush's Social Security privatization
plan and his tax cut would eliminate the projected surplus along
with any hope of paying down the national debt, as the vice
president favors.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would continue these multitrillion-dollar debts
indefinitely and with his tax scheme, would significantly add to
them,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan covers 10 years and is not directly comparable to
Bush's.	   Largely because he assumes higher spending and a slightly weaker
economy than Bush, the vice president says the non-Social Security
surplus will total $746 billion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Gore would use that money -- plus an additional $130
billion in savings largely from raising taxes on tobacco and some
corporate transactions -- for a $250 billion tax cut, an expansion
of health-insurance coverage, a new Medicare prescription drug
benefit, debt reduction and $34 billion worth of still unannounced
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has repeatedly rejected President Clinton's calls for
tobacco and corporate taxes, raising questions about where Gore
would actually get that money.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Gore wants $115 billion more for education. And he
has talked about $9 billion more for cancer research, $5 billion a
year more to help states expand preschool, and unspecified
increases for Internet technology and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for those increases, aides say Gore will keep other
programs from growing as fast as the overall inflation rate. But
Gore has not said which programs, or precisely how much of these
savings he will need.
</P>
<P>
   ''The risk with Al Gore's plan is he'll reinvent big
government,'' said Bush spokesman Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also would use $100 billion of the $2.2 trillion in
projected Social Security surpluses over the next decade to improve
benefits for widows and working women.

<HEADLINE> Gore Doing Worse Than Expected  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore is performing worse than expected in a
handful of states carried by Democrats since 1988, a sign that his
political base needs shoring up in the race for the 270 electoral
votes required to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington state and Wisconsin -- all
carried by Democratic presidential candidates in the last three
elections -- the most recent polling showed Gore trailing or tied
with Republican rival George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is obviously troubling for Gore. Those are states he
should have in his pocket right now,'' said Democratic consultant
Dane Strother.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts expect Gore to reverse his fortunes in these
Democratic bastions, but they said Bush's early strength suggests
he is doing a better job of appealing to independent-minded voters.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president allowed himself to be sidetracked by the
Elian Gonzalez controversy and wasn't helped by recent reminders of
Clinton-Gore scandals. In some places, such as Oregon and
Washington state, local issues have hurt him, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's going on here is remarkable because this is his base.
It's a shaky base right now'' said Steve Schier, a political
scientist at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   National polls give Bush a slight edge over Gore or show the
race a statistical dead heat. The campaign for all-important state
electoral votes also is close: Gore leads in 10 states with 146
electoral votes and Bush leads in 14 states with 144, according to
an analysis of recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   In the most hotly contested battleground, a band of swing states
from Missouri to New Jersey, polls show a tight race -- though Bush
has a six- to eight-point lead in Ohio and Gore is considered just
as strong in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore's in great shape with both general election voters and
Democratic voters because he's in the right place on the issues,''
said spokesman Chris Lehane. ''It's Al Gore who's protecting Social
Security. It's Al Gore who would protect Medicare and Al Gore who
will put real investment into expanding health care and resources
into our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore's message has yet to take hold on the friendliest of
turf, according to Democrats and independent analysts in the five
traditionally Democratic states, which have a total of 46 electoral
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people just aren't tuned into the race yet and people
really don't know a lot about Bush and what his record really is,''
said Kasey Kincaid, a Democratic activist from Des Moines, Iowa.
''This early, people are willing to take a look at Bush but once
they start looking at the issues, they'll come back to Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Bush is benefiting from a monthlong spree of policy
addresses designed to court swing voters, particularly women. The
Texan has promised better schools, affordable health care,
bipartisanship in Washington and housing for low-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush really has been -- for those paying attention -- a lot more
prominent in the news in recent weeks,'' Kincaid said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has kept a low profile after knocking Bill
Bradley from the Democratic race. And his most high-profile moment,
siding with Cuban-Americans on the Gonzalez case, didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has created a lot of publicity for himself with a position
that reinforces negative feelings people have about him -- that he
shifts with the wind, panders, is not trustworthy,'' Schier said.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to forge a centrist message of his own, Gore delivered a
me-too speech on education last week and plans, in a crime address
Tuesday, to call for a greater focus on drug rehabilitation for
convicted felons and to question Bush's commitment on that and
other crime issues.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, Democratic National Committee member Ken Opin said
Bush is being helped by the popularity of Republican Gov. Tommy
Thompson. The nation's 32 GOP governors are Bush's political base,
a symbol of the pragmatic, centrist governing philosophy he
promises to bring to Washington if elected.
</P>
<P>
   ''There may be some carry over from Thompson who is enormously
popular,'' Opin said. ''But that can only get Bush so far, at least
I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington and Oregon, pollster Tim Hibbitts said both states
are in play for Bush ''and that's not good news for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush has been able to portray himself, despite a brutal
primary, as a centrist Republican,'' Hibbitts said.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in the Northwest also tend to be independent-minded, and
may be open to throwing Democrats out of the White House ''just for
the sake of change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts in Washington state say Gore is being hurt by his
refusal to rule out breaching Snake River dams, an act that
Republicans argue would hurt the state's economy. And GOP
operatives suspect they can get some mileage out of the Justice
Department's antitrust lawsuit against Seattle-based Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the states, analysts said news of Clinton-Gore
scandals are bound to take a toll. While Bush pushed his centrist
proposals, Justice Department lawyers interviewed Gore about his
1996 fund-raising activities and the Whitewater prosecutor showed
signs of continued interest in his varied cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing that can beat Al Gore are Republican
investigations,'' Strother said. ''Let's not kid ourselves; they're
going to be tuning up this stuff all the way to November.''

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Set To Begin Wed.  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- Court authorities want to keep
the trial as routine as possible for two Libyans suspected in the
bombing of Pan Am flight 103.
</P>
<P>
   But as victims' relatives arrive, their emotions will mix with
hundreds of reporters and unprecedented security as the trial
begins in the 1988 bombing over Lockerbie, England, that killed
more than 270 people, including 189 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a ghastly 11{ years,'' Jim Swire, a spokesman for
British relatives, told Associated Press Television News.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited trial begins Wednesday at a Scottish court on
Dutch soil. Dozens of relatives were expected to arrive in
Amsterdam early today and make the 40-mile drive to a hotel near
Camp Zeist, a former U.S. Air Force base.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish court authorities said they were trying to keep the
trial as routine as possible at the old base, converted into an $18
million high-security courtroom and detention center.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah are charged
with murder, conspiracy to murder and endangering the safety of an
aircraft in the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of the U.S.-bound flight.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing 15,000 witnesses and collecting 180,000
pieces of evidence in the biggest murder investigation in history,
prosecutors are convinced they have the culprits, who they claim
are Libyan intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, questions remain unanswered, including whether the
Libyans acted alone and how the suitcase bomb passed unaccompanied
through two aircraft changes without raising suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Such riddles have spawned conspiracy theories and dampened the
hopes of victims' relatives that justice will be served.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the court will hold sessions almost daily through
July 28 before adjourning until Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   John Grant, of Glasgow University School of Law, said the
prosecution apparently intends to work backward, first establishing
murder was committed before trying to prove the culpability of the
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a murder trial, after all,'' he said. ''First they have
to prove that there has been a murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The early witnesses will include British aviation experts, as
well as police and investigators who sifted through the debris of
the exploded jetliner after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was expected to cost $3 million a month, mostly paid
by Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers have alleged that other terrorist organizations
operating in Europe at the time were responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Libya's ambassador visited the two defendants Monday in their
detention block -- an area surrounded by high concrete walls and
bales of barbed wire, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They said the defendants were being treated like any suspect
held in pretrial custody in a Scottish jail. They receive visits
from relatives and friends and meet each other and with staff
members each day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya
trying to force the surrender of the defendants. Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi refused, contending the men would not get a fair
trial in Britain or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were handed over in 1999 after the United States and
Britain reached a deal with Gadhafi for the two suspects to stand
trial in an extraterritorial Scottish court proceeding that was
unprecedented in international law.

<HEADLINE> Gore Calls for Drug Testing Inmates  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore says prisoners should be tested for
drug use and offered top-notch treatment programs in an effort to
''stop that revolving door once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of an anti-crime package being unveiled in Atlanta
today, the vice president planned to propose federal funds to hire
50,000 new police across the country and say off-duty officers
should be allowed to carry concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Giving the speech a partisan edge, Gore planned to criticize
Texas Gov. George W. Bush's record of rehabilitating Texas inmates,
advisers said Monday. Bush is the GOP nominee-in-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to stop that revolving door once and for all,'' Gore
said in a draft of his Atlanta speech. ''First of all we have to
test prisoners for drugs while they are in jail and break up the
drug rings in our prisons. We have to expand drug treatment within
our prisons,''
</P>
<P>
   He promised to make prisoners ''a simple deal: Before you get
out of jail you have to get clean. If you want to stay out, then
you better stay clean.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was not expected to estimate the cost of the
initiatives, many of which were first unveiled in his July 1999
anti-crime address in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   They included:
</P>
<P>
   -- Ensuring continued funding of a cops-on-the-street program
started by President Clinton in his bid to convince swing voters
that Democrats can be trusted with crime and safety issues. Gore
promised to fund an additional 50,000 police positions nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   --Establishing gang-free zones that would ban the wearing of
gang-related clothing. Civil liberties groups have questioned the
constitutionality of such laws.
</P>
<P>
   --Making it a federal crime to stalk a child on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   --Targeting telemarketers who prey on senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   --Giving more prison time to inmates who don't break their drug
habits.
</P>
<P>
   The crime speech was coming as a new national poll showed Bush
and Gore in a statistically dead heat. Crime is traditionally an
issue that favor Republican candidates, but Gore hopes to cut into
Bush's advantage.

<HEADLINE> Braves 2, Dodgers 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves won again, and visiting
fans went after John Rocker again.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood scattered five hits over seven innings, and
light-hitting Quilvio Veras homered Monday night as the Braves beat
the Los Angeles Dodgers 2-1 for their franchise-record 14th
straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, making his second road appearance since his
season-opening, two-week suspension, was mooned by a fan who ran on
the field with two outs in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was booed loudly by the Dodger Stadium crowd of 28,790
upon entering the game with a 2-0 lead. Several objects were thrown
on the field, prompting a warning from the stadium announcer.
</P>
<P>
   With Kevin Elster batting and two outs, a fan bolted out of the
right-field stands, ran toward the mound, turned around and dropped
his shorts. The fan quickly was escorted off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Elster singled to drive in Todd Hundley, the first run this year
off Rocker, who had pitched eight scoreless innings. Rocker then
struck out pinch-hitter Geronimo Berroa and was surrounded by
security as he came off the field. Rocker flipped the ball to a fan
in a Braves cap behind Atlanta's dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who haven't lost since April 15, broke the previous
team standard of 13 consecutive wins, set in 1982 and equaled 10
years later. Three of the wins came against the Dodgers in Atlanta
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood (3-0) walked three and struck out four before Rudy
Seanez pitched a perfect eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, who retired 13 of the last 15 batters he faced,
allowed five hits and one unearned run in seven innings of a 5-1
victory over the Dodgers last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Veras, who has two homers this year and just 26 in his 635-game
career, hit a 3-1 pitch from rookie Eric Gagne (0-2) into the
right-center field seats with one out in the third to put the
Braves on top.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne was the hard-luck loser, allowing just four hits in seven
innings while walking two and striking out six. He went six innings
in Atlanta last Wednesday and gave up three runs -- all on solo
homers.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves got an unearned run off Matt Herges in the eighth
when Veras scored from second on an infield hit by Andres Galarraga
and third baseman Adrian Beltre's throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   Veras opened the inning with a single and took second on Andruw
Jones' grounder to second. Veras avoided the tag attempt of second
baseman Mark Grudzielanek, who elected to go to first instead of
throwing to second for the force.
</P>
<P>
   Herges had appeared in 10 games previously this season, pitching
15 scoreless innings.
Notes: Dodgers slugger Gary Sheffield received a scare before the
game when he stepped on a baseball that was underneath a tarpaulin
near the batting cage and rolled his right ankle -- the same ankle
he sprained April 8 in New York that has continued to bother him.
After 40 minutes of treatment, he took about 10 swings off a
batting tee and declared himself ready to play. He went hitless in
four at-bats. ... The Braves, who brought a big league-leading 3.08
ERA into the game, outscored the Dodgers 12-4 in sweeping a
three-game series in Atlanta last week. The Dodgers then scored 25
runs in a weekend sweep of the Florida Marlins. ... Rocker,
suspended for the season's first two weeks for offensive remarks
that appeared in Sports Illustrated over the winter, politely
declined to be interviewed before the game. .. Veras has hit safely
in a career-high 12 straight games. ... The loss was the third 1-0
setback for the Dodgers in a span of eight games. ... Current New
York Yankees manager Joe Torre was the Braves' manager in 1982, and
current manager Bobby Cox was on the job 10 years later.

<HEADLINE> Giants 10, Mets 3  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds hit a ball into San Francisco
Bay for the first splashdown homer at Pacific Bell Park, helping
the Giants beat the New York Mets 10-3 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds watery three-run shot tied Jermaine Dye of Kansas City for
the major league lead with 11 homers as the Giants won for just the
second time in nine games at their new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants slugger drove the first pitch from New York's Rich
Rodriguez over the right-field wall and into McCovey Cove where it
was quickly fished out of the bay with a net by Joseph Figone, a
member of the grounds crew at the Giants' old ballpark on
Candlestick Point.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been making it to every game we've had out here this
season and the exhibition season,'' Figone said. ''I finally got
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Figone was cruising the cove in a raft and was in the right
place at the right time. The crowd erupted when the ball sailed
into the bay and brought Bonds out for a bow.
</P>
<P>
   Figone plans to add the ball to his memorabilia collection, but
would listen to big-money offers to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not stupid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants celebrated the milestone by shooting off water
cannons over the right-field wall and putting up the number one on
a scoreboard designating splashdowns in the bay.
</P>
<P>
   In an exhibition game against the Yankees, Bonds hit a ball that
bounced off the pier-side walkway and into the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Estes went seven-plus innings for his first win of the
season and Jeff Kent homered, doubled and scored three times in a
game that was marked by a spectacular catch by New York center
fielder Jay Payton and a brief tempest that emptied both benches.
</P>
<P>
   Payton made a leaping catch at the wall, taking the ball away
from a fan and a home run away from Bill Mueller, who stopped at
second and put his hands on his hips in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Estes (1-1) allowed three runs on six hits, including Todd
Zeile's seventh-inning homer, while striking out two and walking
five.
</P>
<P>
   New York starter Bill Pulsipher (0-1), recalled earlier in the
day from Triple-A Norfolk, had a rough outing. He lasted 3 1-3
innings and allowed four runs on three hits and four walks. He
struck out three.
</P>
<P>
   Both dugouts emptied when J.T. Snow upended Mets catcher Todd
Pratt sliding into home in the Giants' three-run fourth. Snow and
Pratt exchanged words and players from both sides ran onto the
field but no blows were thrown and order was quickly restored.
</P>
<P>
   Kent homered in the second, a solo shot for the Giants first run
and they led 4-0 in the fourth as Rich Aurilia singled home a run
and Bobby Estalella added a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Felipe Crespo, starting for the first time this
season, had a run-scoring single and another run scored on an error
by left fielder Rickey Henderson.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bonds has reached base via hit or walk in 22 of 24 games.
... Mets catcher Mike Piazza missed a third straight game since
bruising his right wrist at Colorado on Friday. He remains
day-to-day. Meanwhile, catcher Vance Wilson was optioned to Norfolk
to make room on the roster for Pulsipher. ... San Francisco has
homered in 20 of 24 games. ... The Mets came into the game on an
offensive high, having collected 38 hits in their two previous
games, the second-highest output in that span in club history.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 2, Indians 1  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Shane Spencer hit a two-run double and started
a game-ending double play as New York's bullpen barely closed out a
2-1 victory over the Cleveland Indians on Monday night in a game
delayed nearly three hours at the start by rain.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting around the clubhouse waiting through a 2-hour,
44-minute rain delay, Ramiro Mendoza (3-2) allowed four hits in six
innings to improve to 5-0 in his career against the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Jaret Wright (2-2) pitched eight solid innings, but Cleveland's
offense once again couldn't get anything going.
</P>
<P>
   Except for giving up Jim Thome's fifth-inning homer, Mendoza
held the Indians in check by working the low part of the strike
zone. The right-hander turned it over to New York's relievers in
the seventh, and once again the Yankees' bullpen came through.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Mike Stanton struck out David Justice and Thome
before Jeff Nelson fanned Richie Sexson for the final out in the
seventh. Nelson gave up a single to Travis Fryman to open the
eighth and was pulled after Einar Diaz sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre chose to go with Mariano Rivera the
rest of the way, and Rivera earned a shaky league-leading eighth
save.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera walked pinch-hitter Mark Whiten on four pitches, and
after a fielder's choice, walked Roberto Alomar. He then got Manny
Ramirez to hit a weak tapper back to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth, Rivera allowed a single to Justice and a double to
Thome to put the winning run in scoring position. He struck out
Sexson before allowing a line drive to left field by Travis Fryman.
</P>
<P>
   The ball hung up for Spencer, who looked home before seeing
pinch-runner Alex Ramirez caught well off second base. Spencer
threw a one-hopper to shortstop Derek Jeter who stepped on second
base and pumped his fist as he made the final out.
</P>
<P>
   New York's relievers have given up just six runs in 31 1-3
innings over the last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   A slow-moving storm front pushed the first pitch back, but
nothing could postpone another Yankees' victory at Jacobs Field.
New York improved to 22-9 at Jacobs Field, the best record of any
Indians opponent.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth straight one-run game for the Indians, who
have scored just 12 runs in their last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Fryman had three hits for Cleveland, batting only .230 as a team
in 10 home games.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's first double of the season, a grounder that hugged the
line before hitting the bag at third, gave the Yankees a 2-0 lead
in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez singled and Jorge Posada doubled into the
left-field corner. Wright just missed on an 0-2 pitch to Spencer,
who after fouling off three pitches, pulled a ball down toward
third that probably would have been stopped by Fryman but hopped
into left.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The 9:49 p.m. start was the latest in Jacobs Field history,
eclipsing a 9:48 starting time on June 24, 1994, also against the
Yankees. ... New York is avoiding Chuck Finley (3-0) on this trip
through Cleveland. Finley, who is 16-9 in his career against the
Yankees, will make his next start Thursday at Toronto. ...
Knoblauch started at second and didn't seem to be bothered by his
slightly sprained left hand and wrist. ... Interestingly, it's the
Yankees who are honoring the memory of the late Bob Lemon by
wearing black arm bands this season. Lemon, who died Jan. 11, spent
his entire Hall of Fame pitching career with Cleveland, winning 207
games. He managed the Yankees to a World Series title in '78.

Israeli-Palestinian Talks Recess
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   EILAT, Israel (AP) -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators took a daylong
break Tuesday from peace talks that have made little progress, choosing to await
the arrival of a U.S. envoy to help bridge the gaps. Monday's session was marked
by attempts at good will, with Israeli officials acknowledging Palestinian
statehood as inevitable and the Palestinians expressing sympathy for Israel's
pain on Holocaust Remembrance Day, the reason for Tuesday's recess. U.S. envoy
Dennis Ross was to arrive later at this Red Sea port to help push along the
negotiations that have so far revealed ''large differences,'' according to
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Communication poor between prostate cancer patients,doctors  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- A survey of prostate cancer patients and their
doctors finds poor communication between the two, with patients
saying they weren't informed of all treatment options and half the
doctors finding that patients weren't prepared to make such
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which surveyed 307 men diagnosed with prostate
cancer and 302 doctors, was released Monday in conjunction with the
American Urological Association's 95th annual meeting, which ends
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There seems to be a disconnect between physicians and
patients,'' said Dr. David McLeod, director of urologic oncology at
Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod is the surgeon who successfully treated Sen. Bob Dole and
Army Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf for prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod said the communication gap between urologists and
patients threatens effective treatment and underscores the cancer's
nature as a taboo subject of frank discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a treatment battle,'' he said. ''The key to winning the
treatment is communication between doctor and patient.''
</P>
<P>
   In the survey, 94 percent of doctors said they presented
patients with all treatment options. But 32 percent of patients
said such discussions focused on the treatment the doctor
considered best and not on all options.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer of the prostate, a gland involved in semen production, is
the second most common type of cancer found in American men. Early
detection greatly increases the chance of successful treatment.
About 179,300 men were diagnosed with the disease last year, while
about 32,000 die from it annually.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the doctors -- 90 percent -- said they believed
patients used the Internet to learn about the disease. In fact,
only 19 percent said they researched online, opting instead for
newspaper and magazine articles and talking with friends and
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Joe Torre, the New York Yankees manager, did
when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God for my wife. I don't go in there on the Internet and
get information on stuff,'' Torre said Monday from Cleveland, where
his team had a game. ''She's the researcher. She leaves the
(baseball) managing to me, but the rest of the world is up to
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani announced that he
has prostate cancer, which was detected early, a key to successful
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was fortunate,'' said Torre, who called Giuliani to offer
his support. ''Being a high-profile person, I was made aware of
everything, the treatment, the side effects, A-to-Z. But, again,
there's a certain responsibility on the patients' side of it. We
went in with some questions, and unless you raise the questions,
you're not going to get the answers.''

<HEADLINE> Minn. Goes After Holocaust Insurers  </HEADLINE>
By GREGG AAMOT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- When Max Goodman's father died in Europe
60 years ago, he left his family a life insurance policy worth 1
million Romanian lei.
</P>
<P>
   But Goodman and his Jewish family were never able to collect the
money, worth about $5,000 then or $60,000 in today's dollars. They
were imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp in what is now the
Ukraine until 1945, when he, his mother and sister were freed by
Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman tried to cash in the policy after he was liberated, but
dropped the matter when he realized the money would ''maybe buy 10
loaves of bread'' because of postwar inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman eventually settled in St. Paul, where he lives today
with his wife. More than a half-century later, the retired
accountant hopes he will finally get his money, with the help of an
international commission and a new Minnesota law.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never thought of it that I would be able to file a claim,''
Goodman, 76, said recently as his apartment filled with the smells
of a roast and meatballs his wife, Edith, was preparing for a Seder
to mark the beginning of Passover.
</P>
<P>
   The law signed by Gov. Jesse Ventura two weeks ago is designed
to pressure a handful of European insurance companies with
affiliates in Minnesota to cooperate with the International
Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how many of the estimated 200 to 300 Holocaust
survivors in Minnesota will benefit. But the lawmakers who pushed
the bill hope other states will follow suit, creating pressure that
uncooperative insurers will find difficult to resist.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a way to get some kind of leverage with these
companies,'' said Sen. Allan Spear, a Democrat who sponsored the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   California and Washington have enacted similar measures.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota law allows the state Commerce Department to strip
licenses from insurers doing business in Minnesota as long as their
parent companies refuse to cooperate with the commission. The
department also will help Holocaust survivors by sharing
information about claims with the commission and other states, and
by possibly creating a registry of Holocaust-related policies.
</P>
<P>
   The London-based commission, created in 1998 and headed by
former U.S. Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, is working on
behalf of Holocaust victims who owned, were covered by or were the
beneficiaries of policies for life insurance, education or dowries
issued between 1920 and 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Several European insurance companies are involved. For decades,
thousands of policies went unpaid because documents were destroyed
and because in many cases insurers demanded a death certificate, a
difficult if not impossible request of families whose loved ones
died in concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   Spear said while the legislation may put pressure on the
companies, it is unlikely the state would take the extreme step of
taking away any licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's there as a last resort,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry representatives argued against the bill,
saying it could undermine the work of the commission and will be
difficult to administer. But when Republican Rep. Ron Abrams and
Spear brought the legislation to their respective chambers, they
found little opposition. The bill passed the House 133-1 and the
Senate 62-0.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Oertelt, 79, was born to a poor family in Berlin which had
no life insurance. Still, he is proud Minnesota is trying to do
something for its Holocaust survivors and said the law might shed
more light on a dark era.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important that people learn about that time and about
what can happen when hatred and bigotry goes uncontrolled,'' said
Oertelt, who made it through Auschwitz and two other camps before
moving to Minnesota in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new law, Goodman still believes his chances of
collecting on his father's life insurance policy are slim. Based on
a formula that uses a 1938 exchange rate, the 1 million lei policy
was worth about $5,000 or some $60,000 today. The International
Commission allows for recovery of 10 times the policy's original
value, which would bring the amount to about $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''So, maybe they'll find something,'' he said, adding with a
shrug, ''I don't put a big hope on it.''

<HEADLINE> Lenora Fulani says Hillary Clinton attacked to score points  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign reiterated its
criticism of Patrick Buchanan and Lenora Fulani despite Fulani's
accusation that Clinton is merely using the attack to ''score
political points.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She and her professional advisers thought she could score some
political points by name-calling,'' Fulani said Monday. ''They feel
completely secure that they have the support of New York's black
leadership and that they can single me out for abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attended a candidate's forum in Buffalo on Saturday
sponsored by the Independence Party, which is the state wing of the
national Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of soliciting the party's support for her U.S.
Senate candidacy, the first lady condemned the group for allowing
itself to ''become defined by the anti-Semitism, extremism,
prejudice and intolerance of a few shrill voices of both the right
and the left.''
</P>
<P>
   She later said she was referring to Buchanan, a Reform Party
presidential candidate, and Fulani, a left-leaning black activist
who ran for president in 1992 as an independent and who has become
an important force in the Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clinton's spokesman Howard Wolfson reiterated the
campaign's contention that Buchanan and Fulani have a long history
of making anti-Semitic and divisive statements.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why Hillary made it very clear on Saturday that she
won't compromise her principles by running on a ticket with Pat
Buchanan,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fulani wasn't the only one to see another motive in
Clinton's attack.
</P>
<P>
   George Stephanopoulos, former spokesman for President Clinton
and now an ABC News political analyst, described Clinton's going to
the Independence Party event and then turning around to critique it
as a ''Sister Souljah move.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase refers to an incident in 1992, when Bill Clinton,
running for president for the first time, went to an event
sponsored by Jesse Jackson and attacked the racial remarks of black
rap singer Sister Souljah.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way that Bill Clinton's condemnation of Sister
Souljah's militant rhetoric was designed to appeal to white voters,
Hillary Clinton's condemnation of Fulani and Buchanan as
anti-Semitic could appeal to Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that was her motive, I hope the Jewish community isn't
manipulated by it,'' Fulani said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Republican rival for the Senate, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, also appeared at the Independence Party forum but did not
criticize the party during his presentation. Later, however, he
said neither Fulani nor Buchanan ''represent my philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulani said she is not ready to endorse Giuliani for Senate, but
she praised his appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't insult us,'' she said. ''He played the role one
plays if he is looking for the party line.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulani insisted she is not an anti-Semite.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have very strong relationships with lots of progressive Jews
and ordinary Jewish people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about statements attributed to her by the Anti-Defamation
League and others that quote her as painting Jews as ''oppressors''
of minorities or ''storm troopers'' of capitalism, she said the
statements were taken out of context or were quotes from a play by
her mentor, Fred Newman.
</P>
<P>
   She said the ADL has a political agenda and has ''gone after a
host of black leaders.''

<HEADLINE> Court Asked To Reject Elian Asylum  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Juan Miguel Gonzalez wants a federal appeals
court to reject the political asylum claims filed on behalf of his
son, Elian, by the boy's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   A motion on the father's behalf was filed Monday with the 11th
U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta by his lawyer, Gregory Craig.
</P>
<P>
   A brief accompanying the motion argues that the father believes
Elian ''craves the familiarity of his own bedroom'' in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The brief asked the appeals court to uphold a March 21 ruling by
a U.S. District judge in Miami that the court has no right to
second guess the government on matters of asylum. The appeals court
has scheduled a hearing for May 11.
</P>
<P>
   The March ruling was appealed to the Atlanta court by Elain's
Miami relatives. The Cuban boy stayed with them for almost five
months after his rescue at sea last November. He was forcibly
seized from the relatives by federal agents on April 22 and
reunited with his father. They are now staying at a private home at
a secluded area on Maryland's Eastern Shore, awaiting completion of
the legal process.
</P>
<P>
   Craig argued in the brief that when ''Juan Miguel speaks for his
son, he does so without conflict and without coercion.
</P>
<P>
   ''To prolong this case by requiring an asylum hearing, where the
Immigration and Naturalization Service has already found there is
no objective evidence to support a finding that Elian will suffer
persecution on his return to Cuba, would result in a substantial
interference with Juan Miguel's basic right to raise his child and
would cause great damage to his family.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief also sought to debunk the notion that the elder
Gonzalez has not been free to speak his mind since his arrival on
U.S. soil on April 7.
</P>
<P>
   Since that day, ''Juan Miguel has been free to state his views
honestly and openly, without coercion, without fear of
retribution,'' the motion said.
</P>
<P>
   If he had wanted to defect from Cuba, there was ''no better
time'' than when he met with Attorney General Janet Reno and
Immigration Service Commissioner Doris Meissner on April 8, Craig
said. No Cuban diplomats attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The motion also said the father believes that a six-year old boy
found adrift in the Atlantic Ocean and now caught up in the
American legal system ''craves the familiarity of his own bedroom''
in Cardenas.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Elian gets home to Cardenas, he will be greeted by his
friends and family,'' it said. ''He will return to school. He will
play in the streets of his hometown. He will make trips to the
beach and the resort where his father works. Juan Miguel intends to
raise his child as he sees fit and where he sees fit.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief also ridiculed the asylum petition filed on Elian's
behalf by Lazaro Gonzalez, the boy's great uncle in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''Elian signed an application for asylum apparently written in
English,'' the brief said. ''That this six-year old boy could not
have had the slightest understanding of the meaning of that form is
self evident, not only from life experience but also from the fact
that he does not read Spanish, much less English.''
</P>
<P>
   The motion suggested that Elian might have been under duress,
''perhaps susceptible, as children are, to subtle pressures and an
eagerness to please.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, the motion said that Lazaro Gonzalez's sole
contact with Elian occurred in 1998 when the uncle visited Juan
Miguel's home in Cardenas, about a two-hour drive east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ''According to Juan Miguel, Lazaro paid no attention to the boy
during that visit,'' the brief said. ''Lazaro slept during the day,
went to the resort at Varadero Beach in the evenings and drank
during the night.''

<HEADLINE> Man accused of bludgeoning priest declared competent to standtrial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) -- The man accused in the beating death
of a Bristol priest last June has been declared mentally competent
to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   In New Britain Superior Court Monday, state psychiatric experts
testified that after ten months of treatment Michael Ouellette can
understand the charges against him and aid in his own defense.
</P>
<P>
   Ouellette, a homeless drifter diagnosed as a
paranoid-schizophrenic, is accused of beating the Rev. Robert Lysz
to death with an altar candlestick inside St. Matthew Church on
June 24, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   According to an arrest affidavit, Ouellette told police he beat
the priest after the Rev. Lysz refused to let him sleep in the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Ouellette, 33, broke into the church parish house,
accosted Lysz, bit his ear off and bludgeoned him to death.
Ouellette then changed into the dead priest's clothes, stole his
wallet and dragged the body into a corner of the church, where he
covered the bloodied corpse with a green cloth, police have said.
</P>
<P>
   The priest's body was found in the church sanctuary Friday
morning when worshippers arrived for an early morning service.
Ouellette was discovered wandering inside the church by lay workers
who called police.
</P>
<P>
   Ouellette was sent to the state psychiatric hospital in
Middletown shortly after his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The former U.S. Marine developed severe mental illness in his
late 20s and wandered in and out of Bristol, the town where he grew
up, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Ouellette's family has said he suffers from manic-depression and
behaves erratically when he is not taking medication. Police said
Ouellette stopped taking the drugs months before the murder.
</P>
<P>
   The killing led to a proposal at the state Capitol that would
allow the state to force psychiatric patients with violent
tendencies to take their medications. The bill died in committee,
but sponsors have said they may try to revive it as an amendment to
another piece of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Ouellette is due back in court on June 20 for a pretrial
conference.

<HEADLINE> Senate passes downtown development deal  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state Senate voted early this morning
to sink $455 million into the Adriaen's Landing project and settle
a dispute over labor issues that threatened to tank the deal and
unravel the state's $12.3 billion budget.
</P>
<P>
   The spending bill passed 30-6 at 3:37 a.m. after more than two
hours of debate. The measure is expected to be OK'd today by the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a decision we knew was coming,'' said Senate President
Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan, D-West Hartford. ''We have probably the
most clear sense of direction that has ever been in front of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the Hartford waterfront development project include a
700-room hotel, a convention center, entertainment and retail space
and nearly 400 housing units. Also part of the package is a $90
million stadium in East Hartford for the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,400 construction jobs and more than 1,100 permanent jobs
are expected to be created.
</P>
<P>
   The $771 million project will be tax exempt for 15 years, and
critics say spending $455 million of public money on it is a waste.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll be feeding this white elephant for years, but we won't
be feeding it peanuts,'' said Sen. Thomas Gaffey, D-Meriden.
''We'll be feeding it millions and millions of state taxpayer
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The public funding portion of the project has hinged on a
commitment of $210 million in private financing, a threshold Gov.
John G. Rowland says has been met.
</P>
<P>
   The Waterford Group, which has developed the Mohegan Sun casino
in Montville and operates other Connecticut hotels, is one of the
project's major private sponsors. Operators Len and Marc Wolman
have said they'll spend $20 million to build the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wolman's threatened to back out of the deal Friday when
some Senate Democrats wanted to introduce a measure requiring
binding arbitration to settle disputes between unionized hotel
workers and their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   After negotiations Monday, officials from the Hotel &AMP; Restaurant
Employees and Bartenders Union of the AFL-CIO dropped their binding
arbitration demands. Instead, they settled for workers to have the
right to organize without interference from their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, workers would earn a ''standard wage'' -- the
average pay of similar jobs in the state.
</P>
<P>
   That means dishwashers and room attendants at the Adriaen's
Landing hotel would make about $9.50 an hour, said Laura Moye, an
organizer with the Hotel &AMP; Restaurant union. Without that
agreement, those workers would be making about $6.50.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went into this trying to raise wages for Hartford
residents,'' Moye said. ''And we got that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Edith Prague, who voted against the plan, said the bill
doesn't make enough promises for workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purpose of spending this money is to revitalize the city
of Hartford,'' said Prague, D-Columbia. ''The only way we'll
revitalize Hartford is to revitalize the lives of people who live
here. The way to do that is to give people good paying jobs with
benefits and a pension.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor tussle jeopardized a bipartisan agreement on the
state's $12.3 billion budget when Rowland said Friday he would not
approve it until the Adriaen's Landing deal was passed in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani said the governor would sign a
necessary document to implement the budget as soon as the Adriaen's
Landing package passes both the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly is expected to pass the budget after the
House approves the Adriaen's Landing plan today.

<HEADLINE> A Regis-free zone: Millions of viewers without ABC  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A nasty corporate dispute has accomplished what
none of ABC's rivals could do: force millions of viewers to watch
someone other than Regis Philbin.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 3.5 million Time Warner cable customers were in
their second day without ABC programming today after missing the
first celebrity edition of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' in
prime-time Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Philbin, Time Warner customers found a message
saying, ''Disney has taken ABC away from you,'' on the channel that
normally carries WABC-TV in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Co., ABC's corporate parent, is fighting over
how much money Time Warner must compensate Disney for the right to
carry some of its cable channels. The blackout comes during a key
ratings period.
</P>
<P>
   The affected customers are in seven markets served by ABC-owned
television stations. About 1.5 million were in the New York City
area, 665,000 in Houston and 440,000 in Raleigh-Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller numbers of customers in the Los Angeles; Philadelphia;
Toledo, Ohio; and Fresno, Calif., markets also lost service.
</P>
<P>
   ''This could last for six months,'' said Jon Mandel, an analyst
for Grey Advertising in New York, ''because both of them are right
and both of them are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are huge media companies -- this isn't about New York or
this year. This is about the future of this business. They both
need each other and neither of them want to be the one admitting
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Political and economic pressure makes a long wait doubtful. But
both companies are trading unusually bitter rhetoric, and Time
Warner has offered to reimburse customers for the cost of switching
to an antenna for ABC shows. Disney is considering giving a rebate
to customers who get a satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   The blackout was particularly ill-timed for ABC, America's
top-rated broadcaster. In addition to the ''Millionaire'' celebrity
week, many viewers who saw the opening night of the miniseries
''Arabian Nights'' on Sunday couldn't see its conclusion Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, ABC is airing the Kentucky Derby, the
Daytime Emmy Awards and virtually all of the season finales of its
regular series.
</P>
<P>
   In Raleigh, N.C., Dave and Connie Westfall went to a Radio Shack
on Monday to buy a rabbit-ear antenna set.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm furious,'' Connie Westfall said. ''I can't believe it. But
now that I have this, we can watch Regis.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney appealed for help from the Federal Communications
Commission on Monday, but the commission offered no immediate
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Each side said FCC law was on its side: Time Warner said it was
against the law to carry a station without a transmission deal
while ABC said a cable operator cannot stop airing a broadcast
station during a sweeps period.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeps, a period when ratings are used to set local
advertising rates, began Thursday and run until May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had offered a series of deadline extensions after the
original national transmission deal expired Dec. 31. The most
recent deadline, offered in March, expired at 12:01 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner said Disney's demands to carry the Disney Channel
and separate cartoon and soap opera networks on its system would
have added $300 million in costs to its customers; Disney said it
had offered a fair market price.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's abundantly clear to anybody who understands the real
situation -- this is about extorting money from cable customers,''
said Michael Luftman, Time Warner spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Padden, executive vice president of governmental
relations at Disney, said it was a ''damnable lie'' to blame Disney
for pulling the plug.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people are arrogant manipulators,'' Padden said. ''Some
deranged individual has deprived all of these people of ABC.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the blackout affects less than 4 percent of the nation's
100 million TV homes, the dispute isn't likely to shake ABC's hold
on the top spot in the season's ratings, Mandel said. But
advertisers are expected to demand ABC compensate them for the lost
customers.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time such a dispute has deprived cable
customers of their favorite stations, but it is the largest outage,
said Simon Applebaum, senior editor of Cablevision magazine.
Earlier this year, a fight left some 400,000 Cox Communications
customers in the Washington, D.C., area without the Fox network for
a week.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an example of what happens when you allow monopolies
to get too big and they become too predatory and then the consumer
is hurt,'' New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said. ''For the
life of me, I can't figure out why the Justice Department has spent
so much time on Microsoft and so little on this industry.''

<HEADLINE> East Coast thefts of heavy equipment tied to ring  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILMINGTON (AP) -- A multistate crime ring that stole and sold
heavy equipment and tractor-trailers along the East Coast was
broken up after one owner saw his stolen bulldozer at a building
site, authorities say. A Staten Island man has been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three recovered pieces of construction equipment, farm
machinery, commercial vehicles and trailers were worth about $1.5
million, officials said. The thefts occurred all over the East
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Thieves were able to drive away with much of the construction
and farm equipment because many models from the same manufacturer
don't have unique keys, said Ralph Smith, an inspector with North
Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles. In many cases, one key fits
all, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers with the Brunswick County Sheriff's Department and the
DMV enforcement section arrested the man they believe was the
ringleader on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The officers put out word through a middleman who helped sell
the property that a buyer was in the market for a 53-foot trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Kauffman, of Staten Island, arrived at an abandoned lot
in Burgaw, N.C., with a stolen trailer for sale, pulled by a truck
stolen two years ago in New York, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Kauffman, 36, was arrested on 23 counts of possession of stolen
property and conspiracy to steal as well as one count of altering a
vehicle identification number.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they expect to arrest as many as 11 more
people, including some who bought the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   A few people bought without knowing the equipment was stolen,
but most knew the equipment was hot or should have known because of
the low prices, officials said. Some of the pieces of equipment
were worth $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   The middleman, whom police would not identify, helped set up
last week's sting.
</P>
<P>
   State and local authorities said their break in the case came
when a man driving past a construction site near Burgaw recognized
his stolen bulldozer at work even though it had been modified.

<HEADLINE> Relatives of American Lockerbie victims arrive in Netherlands fortrial  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- Relatives of American victims of
the Lockerbie tragedy voiced skepticism today the trial of the two
Libyans accused of bombing Pan Am Flight 103 will settle questions
surrounding the world's deadliest act of air terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited trial was scheduled to begin Wednesday at a
Scottish court located on Dutch soil. About a dozen relatives of
the American victims arrived in Amsterdam early today to attend the
proceedings 40 miles away at Camp Zeist, a former U.S. air base
that was turned into an $18 million high-security courtroom and
detention center.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am hoping for justice and truth, but I don't think we'll get
either,'' said Rosemary Wolfe, whose 20-year-old stepdaughter
Miriam Luby Wolfe died in the Dec. 21, 1988, terror attack that
killed 270 people, including 189 Americans. Thirty-eight of the
victims were from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 40 family members from several countries were expected to
attend the early sessions. Other relatives will watch the trial on
closed-circuit television in Washington, New York, London and
Dumfries, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah are charged
with murder, conspiracy to murder and endangering the safety of an
aircraft in the bombing of the U.S.-bound flight over Lockerbie,
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The attack killed all 259 passengers and crew and 11 people on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing 15,000 witnesses and collecting 180,000
pieces of evidence, prosecutors are convinced they have the
culprits, who they claim are Libyan intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
   But the resignation of the Scottish chief prosecutor, evidence
that other terrorist groups could have been responsible and reports
of witnesses changing their testimony have raised doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are about to confront is a farce,'' said Susan Cohen
of Cape May Court House, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   She suspected the men were surrendered in a deal to absolve
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi of responsibility for his country's
alleged sponsorship of terrorism. ''These guys are just pawns,''
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Dan, distributed photographs of their 20-year-old
daughter Theodora, who died in the explosion. ''This is why we are
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who are really responsible are who we are after,''
said Kathleen Flynn, whose son John Patrick Flynn was returning
from a European study program when he was killed. ''We hope the
truth will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   The relatives were escorted out of the bustling airport and
traveled by bus to a hotel near Camp Zeist. The U.S. Justice
Department paid for their travel.
</P>
<P>
   They will be given priority seating in the courtroom's public
gallery, behind bulletproof glass.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish court authorities said they were trying to keep the
trial as routine as possible, despite high emotions, hundreds of
reporters and heavy security.
</P>
<P>
   The court will hold sessions almost daily through July 28 before
adjourning until Aug. 22, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Early witnesses include British aviation experts, as well as
police and investigators who sifted through the debris of the
exploded jetliner after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was expected to cost $3 million a month, mostly paid
by Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Libya's ambassador visited the two defendants Monday in their
detention block -- an area surrounded by high concrete walls and
bales of barbed wire, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They said the defendants were being treated like any suspect
held in pretrial custody in a Scottish jail. They receive visits
from relatives and friends and meet each other and with staff
members each day.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the U.N. Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya
trying to force the surrender of the defendants. Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi refused, contending the men would not get a fair
trial in Britain or the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were handed over in 1999 after the United States and
Britain reached a deal with Gadhafi for the two suspects to stand
trial in an extraterritorial Scottish court proceeding that was
unprecedented in international law.

<HEADLINE> DioGuardi enters from the right  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSSINING, N.Y. (AP) -- A Giuliani spokesman said today he would
not rule out a write-in campaign to win the Conservative Party
nomination against former Rep. Joseph DioGuardi.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden candidacy of DioGuardi, a Republican who says Rudolph
Giuliani is too liberal, endangers the mayor's grasp on the
conservative votes he may need to beat Democrat Hillary Rodham
Clinton in the race for a U.S. Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on a New York Post report this morning that
Giuliani could attempt to win a Conservative primary as a write-in
candidate, Giuliani campaign spokesman Bruce Teitelbaum said:
''We're keeping our options open and certainly one of those options
is to consider a primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way you get there is open to discussion and we're willing
to consider all options. We still think the door is open with
respect to discussions with the Conservative Party chairman, but
that doesn't preclude other options,'' Teitelbaum said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he was confident he would win a Conservative Party
primary. But state party Chairman Michael Long, who has refused to
back Giuliani because of the mayor's support for abortion rights,
could probably block a primary if he settles on DioGuardi.
</P>
<P>
   DioGuardi, who announced Monday that he wants to be the
Conservative Party candidate, said he's not worried about catching
up to the fund-raising totals of Giuliani and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need a lot more money than me,'' DioGuardi said. ''They
have to disguise who they are. She has to disguise that she comes
from Arkansas, he has to disguise that he believes in partial-birth
abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that Giuliani isn't conservative enough; he's not
conservative at all,'' said DioGuardi, in announcing he would seek
the Conservative, Right to Life and Independence party lines on the
November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In close New York races -- the Giuliani-Clinton race is a
statistical tie, according to a Quinnipiac College Poll out Monday
-- small-party endorsements can mean victory. No Republican has won
a statewide race without the Conservative line since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, they're popping the champagne corks at Clinton
campaign headquarters,'' said GOP consultant and television
commentator Jay Severin, who is not involved in the race. ''You
could almost run a dead body on the Conservative line and attract
enough votes to defeat the Republican candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   DioGuardi, 59, of Ossining, said he expects to win the
Conservative and Right to Life nominations but realizes Giuliani is
the likely Republican candidate. He said his announcement had
nothing to do with the mayor's recent prostate cancer diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many people in New York who are not going to vote if
Giuliani and Clinton are the only choices,'' DioGuardi said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokeswoman Karen Dunn said the campaign had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Long called DioGuardi ''the right candidate'' Monday but held
off on any formal endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   He said DioGuardi could ''blow this into a three-way race'' by
taking votes ''from conservative-minded Democrats and also real
Republicans'' -- the very voters Giuliani is targeting.
</P>
<P>
   DioGuardi, who was born in the Bronx, was a two-term incumbent
who lost his seat in 1988 and failed again in congressional races
in 1992 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He is president of the Albanian American Civic League -- his
father emigrated from an Albanian village in Italy -- and was a
proponent of U.S. military action in Kosovo. He is a certified
public accountant.
</P>
<P>
   The former congressman said Giuliani is a competent mayor but
''hasn't shown any reason to think he can deal with foreign policy,
national security, military morale, any of the things you have to
do as a senator.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton, ''She's a moving van away from the most
scandal-scarred White House maybe in our history,'' DioGuardi said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices opened lower on Tuesday.

<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 50 points in early
trading. Losing issues on the New York Stock Exchange held a 3-to-2

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 49; Nasdaq Down 25  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were slightly lower at the start of
trading today as AT&AMP;T fell after delivering a cautious profit
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 49.09 at 10,762.69.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was down 7.69 at 1,460.56, and the Nasdaq composite index
was down 25.40 at 3,932.68.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell 5 7/16 to 43 5/16 after lowering its earnings
forecasts for fiscal year 2000, saying the competitive
long-distance market is cutting into consumer phone revenue. For
the first quarter, AT&AMP;T posted operating profit of $1.73 billion,
or 53 cents per share. That matched the estimates of analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Also, shares of AT&AMP;T's new Wireless Group fell 2 to 32 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market was fairly quiet, hemmed in by a lack of news
on the inflation fronts. The Federal Reserve holds its next
policy-making meeting on May 16, and many investors are expecting
the Fed to raise interest rates by a quarter-percentage point.
Recent signs of booming economic growth have stimulated some
concerns that the Fed could raise rates by as much as a
half-percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks, so fears of
a sharper-than-expected increase are likely to hang over the market
until the Fed's next meeting, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 124.60 million
shares, slightly ahead of Monday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.66 to 517.27.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.2 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 1.3 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.3 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up
1.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Conservative Party boss says Giuliani wants meeting  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSSINING, N.Y. (AP) -- The head of the state Conservative Party
and aides to Rudolph Giuliani said today that the New York City
mayor is pressing ahead with efforts to win the party's backing for
his Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Party Chairman Michael Long confirmed that the New York City
mayor is seeking a meeting with him. Meanwhile, Giuliani's campaign
manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, said the mayor might also attempt to
collect enough petition signatures to justify a Sept. 12
Conservative Party primary.
</P>
<P>
   Long continued to say the mayor must come out in favor of a ban
on what critics call ''partial-birth abortion'' and refuse Liberal
Party support if he is to have a chance at winning Conservative
Party backing. That has been Long's position for months.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, an abortion rights supporter, has refused to back a
ban on the procedure. He also counts among his top political
advisers Liberal Party boss Raymond Harding.
</P>
<P>
   In close New York races -- the Giuliani-Clinton race is a
statistical tie, according to a Quinnipiac College Poll out Monday
-- small-party endorsements can mean victory. No Republican has won
a statewide race without the Conservative line since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Giuliani said he had talked to Long and expressed
interest in the Conservative line.
</P>
<P>
   Long said this morning that one of the mayor's advisers -- he
wouldn't identify which one -- had telephoned on Monday to say
Giuliani wanted to meet with Long. The party chairman said a
Giuliani adviser has promised to call back by the middle of this
week to set up such a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Long was also critical of the way the mayor was dealing with the
possibility of getting Conservative Party backing. ''This all
should have been done a year ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Teitelbaum said the mayor was not ruling out a
petition effort to force a Conservative Party primary against
former Rep. Joseph DioGuardi or any other candidate party leaders
might come up with.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden candidacy of DioGuardi, a Republican who says
Giuliani is too liberal, endangers the mayor's grasp on the
Conservative votes he may need to beat Democrat Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're keeping our options open and certainly one of those
options is to consider a primary,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way you get there is open to discussion and we're willing
to consider all options. We still think the door is open with
respect to discussions with the Conservative Party chairman, but
that doesn't preclude other options,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he was confident he would win a Conservative Party
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Long said this morning that he had the votes on the party's
executive committee to block any move to put Giuliani's name on the
Conservative Party primary ballot. Giuliani forces believe that if
they collected enough signatures from Conservative Party members,
Long and other party leaders would be under great pressure to allow
a primary with Giuliani as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the intrigue in New York's third-party politics, a
spokesman for the Clinton campaign said today the first lady would
appear at the state Liberal Party's policy committee meeting
Saturday to interview for its nomination. Giuliani also plans to
seek that nomination and even Clinton aides privately concede he
will probably get it.
</P>
<P>
   ''People want to talk to her about why she's running for the
Senate and she's going to do it,'' Clinton spokesman Howard Wolfson
said when asked why she would even bother to attend the Liberal
Party gathering.
</P>
<P>
   DioGuardi, 59, of Ossining, who announced Monday that he wants
to be the Conservative Party candidate, said he's not worried about
catching up to the fund-raising totals of Giuliani and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''They need a lot more money than me,'' DioGuardi said. ''They
have to disguise who they are. She has to disguise that she comes
from Arkansas, he has to disguise that he believes in partial-birth
abortions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that Giuliani isn't conservative enough; he's not
conservative at all,'' said DioGuardi, in announcing he would seek
the Conservative, Right to Life and Independence party lines on the
November ballot.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower in quiet trading today as AT&AMP;T
fell after delivering a cautious profit outlook.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 60.50 at 10,751.28.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 8.55 at 1,459.70, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 38.26 at 3,919.82.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell 5 11/16 to 43 1/16 after lowering its earnings
forecasts for fiscal year 2000, saying the competitive
long-distance market is cutting into consumer phone revenue. For
the first quarter, AT&AMP;T posted operating profit of $1.73 billion,
or 53 cents per share. That matched the estimates of analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Also, shares of AT&AMP;T's new Wireless Group fell 1 5/16 to 33
3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mixed after three days of solid gains.
Microsoft gave up some of its Monday advance and was down 2 5/16 at
71 1/8, and Broadcom rose 9 1/4 to 183 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market was fairly quiet, hemmed in by a lack of news
on the inflation fronts. The Federal Reserve holds its next
policy-making meeting on May 16, and many investors are expecting
the Fed to raise interest rates by a quarter-percentage point.
Recent signs of booming economic growth have stimulated some
concerns that the Fed could raise rates by as much as a
half-percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks, so fears of
a sharper-than-expected increase are likely to hang over the market
until the Fed's next meeting, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people have gone to the sidelines to wait for the
employment data due out Friday,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market
analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ''There's no sense of doom, but
investors are definitely waiting for more data to gauge the
strength of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 305.93 million
shares, slightly ahead of Monday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.99 to 517.94.

<HEADLINE> 'White-Only' Screenings Halted  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A hospital replaced the bone-density scanner
it brought to a state Capitol health fair after protests from
minorities upset that the machine, which screens for osteoporosis,
was accurate on white women only.
</P>
<P>
   The machine from Bellevue Woman's Hospital was calibrated using
genetic data on white women, prompting protesters to post ''White
women only'' signs around its booth at the fair Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't understand why you would bring a machine for white
women only to a public place where there are multiple races. That's
very insulting,'' said Rita Matthews, a state worker who is black.
''It's like we're back in the '40s and '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Fidler, who was conducting the tests, said she could not
verify the accuracy of the test on non-white women. She agreed to
pack up her machine and leave after state Assemblyman Keith Wright,
chairman of the Black, Puerto Rican and Hispanic Legislative
Caucus, told her it shouldn't be used on public property.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital replaced the machine today with one that is
accurate on minority and white women.
</P>
<P>
   ''Knowing what we know now, we aren't going to do that again,''
said Carole Salluzzo, spokeswoman for Bellevue in Niskayuna, about
10 miles west of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Ten million Americans, mostly elderly women, have osteoporosis,
characterized by deterioration of the bone that can lead to
fragility and an increased risk of fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Until the last few years, medical literature has been virtually
devoid of information about bone density in minority women.
Minority woman had appeared in studies to have a genetically higher
peak bone mass, so they were believed to be far less at risk for
the condition.
</P>
<P>
   But a more recent University of Connecticut study based on bone
density scans of 100 black volunteers older than 65 found that
one-third had osteoporosis or experienced enough bone loss to put
them at risk.

<HEADLINE> White House Threatens Budget Veto  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A White House official warned today that
President Clinton would veto forthcoming spending bills unless
Congress provides more money for schools, technology and other
programs than it currently plans.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the Urban Institute, White House budget chief
Jack Lew accused Republicans of choosing to emphasize tax cuts at
the expense of schools, veterans health care, debt reduction and
other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Unless there are significant improvements to Congress's
election-year spending plans, ''the president simply cannot and
will not sign'' the bills, Lew said.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Lew said Clinton wanted ''real protections'' for
patients' rights in dealing with managed health-care plans, and
sufficient money for education, law enforcement, foreign aid and
land conservation.
</P>
<P>
   ''By passing an oversized tax scheme, Congress has effectively
made the decision that tax cuts are more important than any of the
other choices that might be made,'' Lew said.
</P>
<P>
   And signaling that the White House is comfortable pitting GOP
tax cut plans against politically popular debt reduction, Lew
asked, ''Will we plan ahead with realism and responsibility or
simply live for the moment, hoping that everything will be just
fine in the future?''
</P>
<P>
   This week, subcommittees of the House and Senate Appropriations
committees plan to write the first of the 13 annual spending bills
for the coming fiscal year. GOP leaders hope to complete the
measures by early fall -- without a major showdown with President
Clinton -- so lawmakers can go home early and campaign for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   On April 14, Congress approved a GOP-written $1.83 trillion
budget for fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1. It called for a
five-year tax cut of at least $150 billion and perhaps more than
$200 billion, depending on lawmakers' future decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The spending blueprint reserved the entire Social Security
surplus, projected at nearly $1 trillion through 2005, for debt
reduction. It also called for increases for some education,
veterans and other programs, and set aside up to $40 billion for
prescription benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Final decisions on tax and spending will be made as Congress
begins working seriously on such bills. But for now, Republicans
say their plans are a sound division of federal resources.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, spokesman for House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., said Lew's speech reflects ''the insatiable need of the
White House to spend more money.'' He said the administration is
trying to ''paint us as extremists when they know we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The speaker has provided balanced leadership and it drives
Jack Lew nuts,'' Feehery said.

   Microsoft's decline came after Mary Meeker, an influential
technology stock analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said she
believes Microsoft's stock is fairly valued in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Meeker said in a research note she believes the proposal to
break the company in two to satisfy antitrust concerns is an
excessive punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember, we aren't at all opposed to disciplining Microsoft,
but we think a break up is simply too harsh,'' the note said.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: I Dreamed of Africa  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Audiences watching Kim Basinger in ''I Dreamed of Africa'' may
find themselves daydreaming about more interesting movies.
</P>
<P>
   This is Basinger's first film since her Oscar-winning role in
''L.A. Confidential,'' and what a difference ''Africa'' marks from
that tense and twisting thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a real-life woman's forays in Kenya, ''I Dreamed of
Africa'' presents gorgeous panoramas of the harsh continent. So
gorgeous, in fact, that the landscape swallows up the characters,
who somnambulate their way through this bleak, tedious melodrama of
a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Basinger stars as Kuki Gallmann, a woman who flees her idle,
semi-hedonistic life in Italy for a ranch in Kenya with her young
son and new husband.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the first of a bland stream of voiceovers, Kuki
confides, ''This man has come into our lives, and for the first
time in many years, I feel a sense of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Kuki's supposed optimism is undermined at every turn, by an
endless stream of mishaps and tragedies, by her own mournful
demeanor and by a constant, depressing sense of doom that pervades
the film.
</P>
<P>
   Kuki gripes that her husband (Vincent Perez) is never home. She
waxes badly poetic about how good she's become at being alone. She
cautions her son -- portentously -- against keeping poisonous snakes
in his collection of serpents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Looking into the night, I can see eyes staring back at me. I
am afraid,'' Kuki laments. ''What have I gotten myself into? What
have I gotten my son into?''
</P>
<P>
   For someone who professes to love her new life in Africa, who
tells the audience she has ''never been more alive,'' Kuki spends a
lot of time grousing. Except for the occasional joyful scene, such
as her revelry at chasing an elephant out of her garden, Kuki
doesn't seem to have a bit of fun.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty of surface action -- lion, buffalo and snake
attacks, elephants slain for their ivory, highway robbery, a
vicious windstorm. But the action plays out tiresomely, one nasty
turn piled on another, compounding the movie's gloominess.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on Gallman's autobiography, so it can't avoid
the eventual family calamities that befall her without
fictionalizing key elements of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping things real doesn't help moviegoers, though. The film's
dreary air of foreboding becomes positively funereal well before
the hardest of hard knocks hit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I Dreamed of Africa'' so palpably, drippingly foreshadows the
bad things to come that viewers are bound to wonder why Kuki can't
see it coming and get out of Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   The film does wrap up on a semi-positive note, with Kuki
realizing that despite her adversities, she has become caretaker to
a bit of Kenyan turf and the people and animals who live off the
land. The inherent animal-rights message, however, is simplistic,
coming across as nothing more substantial than that poaching is
bad.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is directed by Hugh Hudson, who made the captivating
''Chariots of Fire'' out of the ostensibly dry story of a
God-fearing Olympic runner who won't compete on Sunday. Hudson also
gave Tarzan a more high-brow treatment with his thoughtful
''Greystoke.''
</P>
<P>
   The director is unable to breathe life into this tale of woman
against nature, though.
</P>
<P>
   What Hudson does accomplish is a glorious portrait of Africa and
its wildlife. Too bad the humans never amount to more than
pinpricks against the majestic horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I Dreamed of Africa,'' distributed by Sony, runs 112 minutes
and is rated PG-13.

<HEADLINE> Testimony to begin today in boy's slaying  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- The allegation led to outrage and
changes in the state's witness protection laws: an 8-year-old may
have been shot to death to prevent his testimony in a murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen
Clarke, were found in their home on Jan. 8, 1999. Police said they
were killed the night before as they returned home from grocery
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors who will hear the trial of the first of two brothers
charged in the killings were sworn in late this morning and given
their instructions by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier today, Judge G. Sarsfield Ford rejected a motion from
lawyers for Russell Peeler to delay the trial while new evidence
was examined.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler, 28, is accused of planning the murders to silence B.J.,
who was scheduled to testify against him in the 1998 killing of
Clarke's boyfriend, Rudolph Snead Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's brother, Adrian, who is accused of being the actual
gunman, will be tried later. Both brothers face the possibility of
the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last about four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors plan to call up to 80 witnesses, including a woman
who claimed to be an eyewitness to the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Lee, who lived across the street from Clarke and her
son, originally told police that she heard the two brothers
planning the killings, then acted as a lookout for Adrian Peeler
and watched as he killed the mother and son.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee appeared to recant what she told police in a letter she
wrote to her lawyer in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that I have told them (police) is lies,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, she wrote three separate letters to
Bridgeport police officers in which she apologized for her role in
the killings and said she was grateful that the Peelers didn't kill
her.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's lawyers say they will use Lee's letter to try to
discredit her with the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that I can say without question that she was not
there. She didn't see anything that happened, and none of her
testimony is consistent with the forensic evidence that's known in
the case,'' said defense attorney John Walkley.
</P>
<P>
   Lee pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and agreed to
testify against the brothers in exchange for a maximum sentence of
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict said during a
pretrial hearing last week that Lee's letter is nothing more than
''cold feet'' from a woman who has a terminal illness and wants a
shorter sentence so she doesn't die in prison. Benedict said Lee
plans to testify to her original story.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors would not comment on their case against Peeler.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're prepared to present all of the evidence of this horrific
crime and leave it in the hands of a fair-minded jury,'' said
Assistant State's Attorney Joseph T. Corradino.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's lawyers plan to call about 15 to 20 witnesses. Walkley
said no decision has been made yet on whether Peeler will take the
stand in his own defense.
</P>
<P>
   The defense will try to show the jury that the crimes could have
been committed by someone else by pointing out that Snead -- like
Peeler -- was a drug dealer and had dangerous associates.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler was subsequently convicted of killing Snead and
is now serving a 105-year sentence. He was also convicted of
running a drug operation in Bridgeport and received a life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Walkley said Monday that the defense plans to ask Judge G.
Sarsfield Ford to delay the start of testimony Tuesday by at least
a couple of weeks because of discovery material turned over by
prosecutors this weekend. Walkley would not elaborate on the
material, except to say that some of it involved Lee's testimony.
Ford has rejected several earlier requests for continuances by the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   After the killings, the state Legislature stiffened the penalty
for intimidating a witness and ordered the chief state's attorney
to offer protection to witnesses who want it. The program, named
after B.J. and his mother, also allows the state to take custody of
child witnesses if their parents fail to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport police say they initially placed special patrols
outside Clarke's home, but called them off after a few days because
Clarke said she found the police presence intrusive.

the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last about four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors plan to call up to 80 witnesses, including a woman
who claimed to be an eyewitness to the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Lee, who lived across the street from Clarke and her
son, originally told police that she heard the two brothers
planning the killings, then acted as a lookout for Adrian Peeler
and watched as he killed the mother and son.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee appeared to recant what she told police in a letter she
wrote to her lawyer in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that I have told them (police) is lies,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, she wrote three separate letters to
Bridgeport police officers in which she apologized for her role in
the killings and said she was grateful that the Peelers didn't kill
her.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's lawyers say they will use Lee's letter to try to
discredit her with the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that I can say without question that she was not
there. She didn't see anything that happened, and none of her
testimony is consistent with the forensic evidence that's known in
the case,'' said defense attorney John Walkley.
</P>
<P>
   Lee pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and agreed to
testify against the brothers in exchange for a maximum sentence of
seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict said during a
pretrial hearing last week that Lee's letter is nothing more than
''cold feet'' from a woman who has a terminal illness and wants a
shorter sentence so she doesn't die in prison. Benedict said Lee
plans to testify to her original story.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors would not comment on their case against Peeler.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're prepared to present all of the evidence of this horrific
crime and leave it in the hands of a fair-minded jury,'' said
Assistant State's Attorney Joseph T. Corradino.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's lawyers plan to call about 15 to 20 witnesses. Walkley
said no decision has been made yet on whether Peeler will take the
stand in his own defense.
</P>
<P>
   The defense will try to show the jury that the crimes could have
been committed by someone else by pointing out that Snead -- like
Peeler -- was a drug dealer and had dangerous associates.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler was subsequently convicted of killing Snead and
is now serving a 105-year sentence. He was also convicted of
running a drug operation in Bridgeport and received a life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Walkley said Monday that the defense plans to ask Judge G.
Sarsfield Ford to delay the start of testimony Tuesday by at least
a couple of weeks because of discovery material turned over by
prosecutors this weekend. Walkley would not elaborate on the
material, except to say that some of it involved Lee's testimony.
Ford has rejected several earlier requests for continuances by the
defense.
</P>
<P>
   After the killings, the state Legislature stiffened the penalty
for intimidating a witness and ordered the chief state's attorney
to offer protection to witnesses who want it. The program, named
after B.J. and his mother, also allows the state to take custody of
child witnesses if their parents fail to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgeport police say they initially placed special patrols
outside Clarke's home, but called them off after a few days because
Clarke said she found the police presence intrusive.

<HEADLINE> Chimps Get Birth Control Implants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- The Uganda Wildlife Society is giving
birth control implants to female chimpanzees in two sanctuaries to
keep numbers down, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Implanon, the trade name of the implant manufactured by the
Netherlands-based Organon pharmaceutical company, is inserted under
the skin of the females' forearms when they reach reproductive age
at sanctuaries in Entebbe and Ngamba, state-owned New Vision said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified veterinarian as saying the
implants last three years. Once they are removed, conception is
again possible.
</P>
<P>
   The wildlife society set up the sanctuaries to care for orphaned
chimpanzees and animals seized from smugglers. But the sanctuaries
have limited space for the chimpanzees, and wouldn't be able to
handle many more.
</P>
<P>
   There are 32 chimpanzees in the sanctuaries, and eight females
have received the implant.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said the implants, which consists of tiny rods
packed with hormones, costs $60 for a three-year dose, and were
donated by an Australian organization it did not identify.
</P>
<P>
   Implanon arrived on the European market late last year for human
use. It has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for use in the United States.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense May Leave Canada Open  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- If Canada opts out of the U.S. missile
defense project and a Canadian city were to come under missile
attack, the United States might choose not to shoot it down, a
senior U.S. military officer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Adm. Herbert Browne, deputy commander of U.S. Space
Command, said that the United States wants Canada to participate in
the antimissile system, which is being developed at an estimated
cost of $20 billion to defend all 50 U.S. states against attack
from a small number of intercontinental ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, the antimissile system as currently
designed could protect much of Canada as well as the United States.
The Canadian government, however, has so far balked at joining the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said that if Canada participated, then the antimissile
system could be commanded and controlled by the North American
Aeropsace Defense Command, the joint U.S.-Canadian operation in
Cheyenne Mountain, Colo., where the two countries have defended
North American airspace for five decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the absense of a Canadian role, the system would be commanded
by U.S. Space Command. President Clinton is scheduled to decide by
fall whether to move ahead with the missile defense system, which
could be ready for operations as early as 2005. The missile
interceptors would be based in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing for reporters on his command's role in national
missile defense, Browne said that if U.S. satellites detected a
hostile missile headed for Ottawa, ''We would have absolutely no
obligation to defend'' the Canadian capital, unless Canada were a
participant in the antimissile system.
</P>
<P>
   Asked later to elaborate, Browne raised the theoretical
possibility that an attacker might shoot missiles first at Ottawa
and then at Detroit or another U.S. city. If the United States
expended its available missile interceptors protecting Ottawa and
were left with none to defend Detroit, the American public would
say ''that makes absolutely no sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said that in many cases, hostile missiles would be
engaged over Canadian airspace even if they were aimed at American
rather than Canadian targets.
</P>
<P>
   Browne said Canada should not only participate in the
antimissile project but contribute to it as well. He said Canada
could contribute by allowing the United States to put a
high-powered radar somewhere in eastern Canada to help track
incoming missiles.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Readiness Hits Low  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. Air Force readiness to fight a war
slumped in recent months to its lowest level in 15 years, declining
28 percent since the end of the Cold War, a senior military
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Only 65 percent of the force's combat units were considered
operating at the military's best levels of readiness in December
and January, the official said on condition of anonymity. That
means roughly 115 of its 329 combat units were not fully capable of
performing their mission.
</P>
<P>
   The rating is based on calculations of whether the units have
the people, supplies, equipment and training to do their jobs -- and
it's been steadily declining for years.
</P>
<P>
   The 65 percent rating early this year, for instance, compares
with 95 percent readiness in 1989 and 76 percent at the end of
1998, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The official blamed budgets that didn't allow enough for spare
parts and didn't offer service members salaries competitive in
today's booming U.S. economy. That has meant a loss of pilots to
the nation's commercial airlines and of other personnel to other
civilian jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that all of us underestimated the amount of money you
needed to keep the force going'' after the of post-Cold War
drawdown in people, equipment and so on, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has been downsized by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And in one year, for example, only 81 percent of what was needed
for spare parts was budgeted. ''That catches up with you,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also blamed the aging fleet of aircraft and increasing tempo
of operations, naming the 1990-91 Gulf War, the bombing crusade two
years ago to punish Iraq for not cooperating with U.N. weapons
inspectors and last year's NATO-led war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The rating had moved back up slightly since January, to 67
percent as of April 1, because the Air Force purposely cut back on
some tasks and took the lull in activity to catch up on some
training, put extra money towards restocking supplies and do
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Besides combat units, there are more than 2600 other units in
the force, and those are considered at 81 percent readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping in 2000-2001 that our readiness is going to turn
around,'' he said, because of salary increases approved last year
and efforts to increase recruiting.

<HEADLINE> Metal Balls Fall on South Africa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- For a while, it seemed as if
some strange meteorological phenomenon was hitting South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   A metal ball fell from the sky Thursday onto a farm near
Worcester, 45 miles east of Cape Town, leaving an 8-inch dent in
the ground. On Friday, another ball a yard wide plummeted from the
sky onto a farm in Durbanville, just outside Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard the sound of crackling thunder, yet there were no
clouds,'' said Philip Schew, a tenant farmer near Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   NASA scientists said the balls were garbage from a Delta rocket
launched in 1996. The balls had been expected to land somewhere in
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Johnson, who is in charge of orbital debris for NASA, said
space garbage re-enters the Earth's atmosphere almost every day,
landing mostly in the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although no one had been hurt by these objects in the last 40
years, the U.S. government would compensate anyone who is struck by
the objects,'' Johnson was quoted as telling South Africa's 702
radio station.

<HEADLINE> 75-Year-Old Tenor Back for 'Otello'  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Imagine Willie Mays coming back to baseball --
and picking the seventh game of the World Series for his return.
</P>
<P>
   Switch home plate for Carnegie Hall, and that's pretty close to
what 75-year-old tenor Carlo Bergonzi is doing by performing
Giuseppe Verdi's fiendishly difficult opera ''Otello'' for his
first time. Most tenors start fading in their 50s.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's little space left for me -- I'm going towards 80,'' the
tenor said with a smile after a grueling four-hour dress rehearsal
for Wednesday's performance with the Opera Orchestra of New York,
Eve Queler conducting.
</P>
<P>
   So closely watched was this musical moment that within hours,
the Internet was abuzz with comments from aficionados. The verdict:
amazing.
</P>
<P>
   The aging, paunchy Bergonzi has a voice that is a force of
nature. His searing performance as the Venetian Moor of
Shakespeare's drama ''brought me to tears,'' Queler said after the
rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian tenor hit his share of artistic home runs as a top
Verdi tenor for five decades. In 1994, he sang his Carnegie Hall
farewell and retreated to the Italian countryside to run an inn in
Busseto, near Verdi's birthplace, and teach.
</P>
<P>
   After a 50-year career, Bergonzi didn't need Carnegie Hall,
which is a megaphone of a stage that draws fierce critics. But he
couldn't resist this musical curve ball.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jon Vickers retired in the 1980s, Placido Domingo has been
the only truly stellar Otello, and Luciano Pavarotti sang the role
to mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Then last June in New York, Queler heard Bergonzi sing a single
aria from ''Otello'' -- ''Niun mi tema,'' meaning, ''Let no one fear
me'' -- as the Moor surrenders to authorities after strangling his
wife in a jealous fit.
</P>
<P>
   The conductor was impressed, and their agents talked.
</P>
<P>
   At Saturday's rehearsal, weeks shy of his 76th birthday, he sang
full voice, hitting high notes that would be the envy of far
younger men. ''He holds the high notes more than any tenor who sang
Otello ever has,'' Queler said.
</P>
<P>
   And he is one of the few artists who can sing as softly and
tenderly as Verdi wrote parts of the score -- a marking of pppppp,
or six times pianissimo. Domingo, in his 50s, doesn't have that
kind of control.
</P>
<P>
   In a youth-driven time, said conductor Queler, ''Bergonzi is
thrilling. And his age is a benefit, not a liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a few slightly raspy notes work in his favor, lending a
heartbreaking power to the tormented figure of Otello.
</P>
<P>
   The tenor's secret? A vocal technique -- modeled after that of
the nearly forgotten tenor Aureliano Pertile -- that has sustained
Bergonzi while his contemporaries have long since retired.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't do Otello at my age without the technique,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in the twilight of his career, he will dominate an
orchestra, chorus and solo cast half his age, including a Pavarotti
protege, soprano Kallen Esperian, as Desdemona. His wife of 40-plus
years, his two sons and two grandchildren are all in New York for
the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've sung all of Verdi's operas, wearing them like a necklace
of pearls,'' he said. ''And this,'' he said of the deadly love
story, ''is the last -- my black pearl.''

<HEADLINE> Border Plant Remains Dumping Ground  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- The once-busy factory is quiet now, its
roof and walls missing all but a few panels, its yard strewn with
the rusting hulks of heavy machinery.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing hasn't changed since 1994, when the Mexican
government ordered the U.S.-based operators to shut down the lead
recycling plant: An estimated 6,600 tons of ash-like residue
containing lead and other hazardous compounds is still there, on
the wind-swept mesa above a working-class Tijuana neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say it is one of the worst known cases of dumping by
a foreign company along Mexico's 1,200-mile northern border.
</P>
<P>
   The plant, observers say, demonstrates the failure of policies
implemented under the North American Free Trade Agreement to
enforce environmental quality standards and punish violators.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have an irresponsible U.S. company taking advantage of
Mexico's lax labor and environmental laws. They just made their
quick money and left,'' said Cesar Luna, an attorney for San
Diego's Environmental Health Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The plant extracted and resold lead from old batteries from cars
and planes. Lead can be absorbed through the skin, lungs and eyes,
and long-term exposure can damage the central nervous system,
kidneys, blood and reproductive system.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood residents have complained of respiratory ailments
and birth defects, but no scientific studies have found any
connection to the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Metales y Derivados, as the company that ran the
plant was known, is receiving renewed attention from an
international panel created under NAFTA to monitor the
environmental protection efforts of the three participating
countries: Canada, the United States and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the plant, a Chilean named Jose Kahn, declined
requests for an interview. But his son, Reinaldo, who was plant
manager, said he and his father are working with Mexican
authorities and are waiting only for bank financing to pay for the
cleanup, which he estimates will cost $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to wait for the loan to come through and we'll
clean it up,'' he said. ''It may take one week, it might take
another year.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the lead-laden residue blows across the site from
dozens of open, steel drums and bundles wrapped in ripped canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite assurances of a pending cleanup, residents of the
neighborhood below have their doubts after six years of delay.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one has done anything to clean it up,'' said Maurelio
Sanchez, president of a neighborhood association. ''We've just been
abandoned here.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, staff members of the NAFTA panel, the
Commission for Environmental Cooperation, decided an investigation
into Mexico's handling of the case is warranted. That
recommendation still needs approval from at least two of the
environmental ministers from the three NAFTA nations.
</P>
<P>
   The panel has no power to punish a member nation. It can only
publish the results of its findings as a public rebuke -- a penalty
environmental groups criticize as too lax.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are being exposed to hazardous materials and the best
we can hope for is a factual record. It doesn't make any sense,''
said Luna, whose group requested the review of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Under NAFTA, anyone can ask the commission to investigate and
release a factual record, but only one such report -- involving a
cruise ship pier near a coral reef on the Mexican island of Cozumel
-- has been done so far.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's official response to the commission's report requesting
an investigation is confidential. A U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency said Mexican officials did as much as they could to punish
the plant owners.
</P>
<P>
   ''They applied all the tools they have in their tool kit,'' said
Chris Reiner, hazardous waste coordinator for the EPA's border
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican agency that enforces the country's environmental
laws, known as PROFEPA, repeatedly cited the Kahns during the 12
years of the plant's operation. It closed the plant temporarily in
1992 and shuttered it permanently in 1994 for failing to dispose of
hazardous waste properly.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also obtained an arrest warrant for Jose Kahn, but
made no attempt to extradite him from San Diego, where he operates
a scrap-metal trading company. Reinaldo Kahn said his father plans
to evade the warrant by staying out of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for PROFEPA, Ignacio Duran, confirmed that officials
are working with the Kahns to remove the waste.
</P>
<P>
   Reinaldo Kahn said the cleanup delays have been caused by
difficulties obtaining financing and negotiations with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Others see more sinister reasons. Sanchez, president of the
neighborhood association, believes authorities have been slow to
act because the people living near the plant are mostly poor
assembly-line workers.
</P>
<P>
   Luna agreed: ''If this had been in the United States, it would
have been declared a Superfund site and people would have been
moved out.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Reiner said, ''is that the border acts as a shield
against environmental enforcement.''

<HEADLINE> VH1 Introduces VH1 Classic  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- So far, VH1 chief executive John Sykes has
avoided the topic with his old buddy John Mellencamp. It's not a
conversation he's looking forward to.
</P>
<P>
   Would YOU like to tell the notoriously cranky rock singer that
he's getting too old for your network?
</P>
<P>
   Sykes was Mellencamp's manager for a time in the 1980s, when the
singer was a mainstay on VH1's younger cousin, MTV. During the last
decade, Mellencamp's music moved across the dial to VH1, which
shoots for an audience around age 30.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 48-year-old Mellencamp's videos are about to be sent to
the newest rung of Viacom's entertainment ladder, VH1 Classic,
which debuts as an all-digital channel later this month. The new
network will concentrate on the favorites of baby boomers, the
generation that grew up on the Beatles, Rolling Stones and Motown.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the cradle-to-grave philosophy at Viacom, or at
least cradle-to-gray hair.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom grabs television viewers early with its popular
children's channel, Nickelodeon. When the hormones start raging,
it's on to MTV. When it's time to settle down and get a job, VH1
beckons. Now VH1 Classic is the next step.
</P>
<P>
   Since he arrived at VH1 in 1994, Sykes has given focus to a
music-based network that often lacked one. He has gradually built
VH1's credibility and power, to the point where January was the
most-watched month in the network's history. The dishy series about
rock stars' dirty laundry, ''Behind the Music,'' is an institution,
and the yearly divas concert is a rite of spring.
</P>
<P>
   Yet programming at Viacom network is like shooting at a moving
target, and Sykes knows he had better be prepared to move, too.
</P>
<P>
   MTV has remade itself over the past few years into ground zero
of the teen pop phenomenon, driving the sales of 'N Sync,
Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. VH1 faces a
similar transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you are 30 years old, you were 20 when you first heard
Nirvana,'' he said. ''You were 15 when you first heard Run DMC.
It's only logical that we will adopt those viewers to our format.
The culture at MTV Networks is about staying true to your
demographic and letting the audience move through.''
</P>
<P>
   Artists like Jewel, D'Angelo, Sheryl Crow and Macy Gray are the
new VH1 mainstays. The veterans -- Mellencamp, Steely Dan, Don
Henley -- won't be forgotten, but they're most likely to be seen
reliving their glories on a program like ''Storytellers.''
</P>
<P>
   It also means being ready to accept the generation that grew up
musically on rap as it approaches age 30, even if it makes for a
dividing line with older viewers who have never embraced the style.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to play it,'' Sykes said. ''We'd be crazy not to.
Otherwise, we're going to fade away with our viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of VH1's new series are variations on themes already
explored on MTV. While MTV has ''Fanatic,'' which follows
star-struck music devotees as they encounter their heroes, VH1 will
debut ''Fan Club'' this month. The new series focuses on the people
who obsess over certain musicians.
</P>
<P>
   VHI has also recently begun a live music news show, ''The Daily
One,'' that recalls MTV's ''Total Request Live.''
</P>
<P>
   While ''TRL'' with Carson Daly has been the key to MTV's
transformation, it has the advantage of a built-in audience ready
to sit in front of the television when it gets home from school.
VH1 has no such luxury. The network is experimenting with the show
at 2 p.m. ET, but Sykes said it is likely to eventually land on the
early evening schedule.
</P>
<P>
   He wants ''The Daily One'' to be ''like the friend you used to
have who you gossiped about music with, that you no longer have
because you're an accountant and you sit next to someone who can't
stand music.''
</P>
<P>
   VH1 has other new series, hoping that at least one will catch on
like ''Behind the Music.'' In March, it began the documentary
series ''Rockstory,'' with ''ER'' actor Anthony Edwards as host,
that looks at particular moments with an impact on society. ''Sound
Affects,'' premiering in June, talks to people whose lives have
been changed by a song.
</P>
<P>
   The network is also branching out into original movies. One
picture looks back on the lives of music's prefab four, the
Monkees. Another, ''Out of Sync,'' is a comedy about a luckless
music producer who inadvertently discovers a housewife with an
extraordinary voice.
</P>
<P>
   Movies are the natural evolutionary step for a network that,
like MTV, began its life by chiefly showing music videos. Now
executives prefer longer-form programming so viewers are more apt
to stay tuned longer and watch the advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's this preconceived notion that a music channel has to
play videos all day because that's what MTV did 20 years ago,''
Sykes said. ''It's a totally different audience now.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Leader's Condition a Mystery  </HEADLINE>
By GINNY PARKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- When Japan's prime minister suddenly collapsed
after a stroke last month, reporters and camera crews rushed to the
downtown Tokyo hospital where he was taken, setting up camp and
awaiting word on his condition.
</P>
<P>
   Word never came.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a month after Keizo Obuchi's stroke set off a political
succession crisis, information about his condition remains scant.
Doctors have yet to give a news conference. Politicians have
offered details only grudgingly, and then often have conflicted
with each other. And though Obuchi remains in his hospital room in
a coma, virtually all the reporters are gone.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, such is often the case. Public disclosure is still a
novel and frequently ignored concept here. Doctors regularly refuse
to show patients their charts; juvenile court records are closed
even to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   But there are signs that the blackout over Obuchi has caused
some re-examination.
</P>
<P>
   National newspapers have tried to piece together the foggy chain
of events that followed Obuchi's collapse while criticizing the
apparent leadership vacuum that resulted.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition party leaders, meanwhile, are shouting cover-up. They
say the murkiness calls into question the right of Obuchi's
successor, former Liberal Democratic Party secretary-general
Yoshiro Mori, to govern. They have demanded that Obuchi's doctors
appear before Parliament for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no transparency at all in this process. It was one
lie after another,'' said Osamu Matsumoto, an official with the
opposition Democratic Party of Japan. ''If you've got leaders
standing on lies, who knows when the citizens will be tricked.''
</P>
<P>
   The events following Obuchi's collapse have been mired in
secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   He was hospitalized early April 2, but the government failed to
announce it for 22 hours, and 12 more hours passed before the
nation learned he was in a coma. Officials at the prime minister's
office even told reporters Obuchi was at home when he was actually
in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki, meanwhile, took over as
acting prime minister. A few leading party members then met behind
closed doors to select a successor, Mori, who was later voted in by
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Holes have since arisen in the official story. Aoki, for
instance, said the ailing Obuchi ordered him to take over. Other
senior Liberal Democratic Party officials told versions that
contradicted this, then retracted them later.
</P>
<P>
   Details about the health of politicians and candidates are
typically kept under wraps in Japan. The hospital where Obuchi is
staying will not comment on his condition. On Tuesday, officials
there refused to meet with a reporter and would only speak briefly
via a telephone in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Aoki -- the one government official
speaking publicly on Obuchi's condition -- repeatedly says he cannot
answer specific questions because he is not a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The official silence comes in a nation where freedom of
information is still a new concept. Until lawmakers last year
passed a bill to increase public access to government information,
details about decision-making in Japanese government ministries
were not made public.
</P>
<P>
   Even as information begins to flow a bit more freely, officials
in many sectors and all levels of society often show little
compunction about withholding details from citizens. The problems
even extend to law enforcement: Earlier this year, a state police
chief and other officials admitted to covering up another officer's
drug use to protect the ''dignity'' of the police department.
</P>
<P>
   ''The officials should at least be up front about things that
directly affect us,'' said vocational school student Kazue
Ichinose, 19. ''They're not even doing that. It's just going to
cause more problems.''

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Flood Victims Leave Camps  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- With the rainy season over and river
levels receding, hundreds of thousands of Mozambicans displaced by
floods are leaving aid camps to return to demolished villages.
</P>
<P>
   About 2 million of Mozambique's 19 million people lost their
homes in the floods that began in February, and many of those
pouring from the camps carried plastic sheeting and tents.
</P>
<P>
   A mass exodus has nearly emptied the country's largest
displacement camp, which once held 60,000 people. Only 2,500
remained Tuesday at Chaqualane, about 125 miles northeast of
Maputo, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Flood victims have left other refugee camps in central and
southern Mozambique, although many return periodically to get food.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 600,000 people will need to be fed until the end of
September, said Inyene Udoyen, a spokesman for the World Food
Program.
</P>
<P>
   Roads have been restored to many areas, making it possible for
the food program to truck in food, but the funding is drying up for
helicopters that reach remote areas.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. agency has 14 aircraft, but many will be phased out by
May 12, Udoyen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At present we are reaching pretty much everyone,'' he said.
''We hope to keep one helicopter flying from Maputo and one from
Beira, and maybe one C-130 cargo plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding Mozambique's infrastructure will take years and an
estimated $450 million, which aid groups hope to raise at an
international donors conference beginning Wednesday in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Though water supplies have been re-established and basic
infrastructure rebuilt in some flood-stricken towns, much work
needs to be done in rural areas, UNICEF's Ian Macleod said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think some quite remarkable progress has been made there but
there is certainly a long way to go,'' he said. ''About 60 schools
have reopened in the last 10 or 11 days, which is an important step
back to normality.''
</P>
<P>
   The floods damaged more than 600 primary schools and 620 miles
of roads, downed 250 miles of power lines and swept away the crops
and cattle of farmers in the southeast African nation, one of the
world's poorest.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of people scrambled up trees and onto rooftops
to escape the floodwaters, and await helicopter rescue, but the
flooding killed 700 Mozambicans.
</P>
<P>
   Most flood victims were subsistence farmers who lived in reed
and mud huts. While aid agencies distributed tons of seed and
agricultural implements, very little funding was made available for
building materials, Macleod said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Congress on China  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT , AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today it would be ''a
very, very unwise and precarious move'' for Congress to deny normal
trading relations for China.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks before a pivotal House vote, Clinton presented his
case for normalized trade with China during a speech before a
conference of the Independent Insurance Agents of America. Later,
he raised the issue again in an address at the State Department
before the Council of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The president also was to meet with Martin Lee, the Hong Kong
leader who has struggled for free elections and freedom of speech,
and supports China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he sympathizes with demonstrators in Washington and
Seattle who recently protested that the WTO should be more open and
democratic. ''But that's not an excuse for sticking it to China
after China has made good faith efforts to open its economy and to
give access to the other members of the world trading community,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger spoke at
Columbia University in New York and said that rejecting normalized
trade with China would have ''serious and substantial consequences
for our national security.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rejecting (normalized trade) is a risky proposition,'' Berger
said in prepared remarks. ''Rejection will set off a downward
spiral that could disrupt stability in Asia, diminish the chance of
dialogue across the Taiwan Strait and deflate hopes for a more
constructive relationship between the U.S. and China,'' Berger
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rejecting (normalized trade) would be the worst possible blow
to the best possible hope we have had in more than 30 years to
encourage positive change in China,'' Berger said. A copy of his
speech was released in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and congressional supporters of the trade
proposal are showing new optimism that they will prevail in the
showdown vote later this month. The administration is seeking to
end the annual review of China's trade privileges as part of a deal
clearing the way for Beijing to enter the World Trade Organization,
which sets the rules for global trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a national security point of view, it would in my view be
a very, very unwise and precarious move to say that the United
States doesn't care whether they're part of the world community or
not,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't have to agree with another country on everything to
say you prefer to trade with them than have an arms face-off with
them and constant conflict with them,'' Clinton added. ''So it's in
our national security interest, but it's necessary to keep our
economy going.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's 1.2 billion people over there and increasingly more
and more of them will be able to buy what Americans can sell,'' he
said. ''And as people sell more over there, they'll have more to
buy insurance with. It's very important.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 44; Nasdaq Dips 32  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were lower in quiet trading today as AT&AMP;T
fell after delivering a cautious profit outlook.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 44.67 at 10,767.11.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 6.46 at 1,461.79, and the Nasdaq composite index was
down 32.97 at 3,925.11.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell 6 15/16 to 41 13/16 after lowering its earnings
forecasts for fiscal year 2000, saying the competitive
long-distance market is cutting into consumer phone revenue. For
the first quarter, AT&AMP;T posted operating profit of $1.73 billion,
or 53 cents per share. That matched the estimates of analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Also, shares of AT&AMP;T's new Wireless Group fell 1 13/16 to 32
11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mixed after three days of solid gains.
Microsoft gave up some of its Monday advance and was down 2 7/16 at
71.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's decline came after Mary Meeker, an influential
technology stock analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said she
believes Microsoft's stock is fairly valued in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Meeker said in a research note she believes the proposal to
break the company in two to satisfy antitrust concerns is an
excessive punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember, we aren't at all opposed to disciplining Microsoft,
but we think a break up is simply too harsh,'' the note said.
</P>
<P>
   Several other prominent technology stocks rose. Broadcom was up
9{ to 183} and Qualcomm was up 5 15/16 at 115 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market was fairly quiet, hemmed in by a lack of news
on the inflation fronts. The Federal Reserve holds its next
policy-making meeting on May 16, and many investors are expecting
the Fed to raise interest rates by a quarter-percentage point.
Recent signs of booming economic growth have stimulated some
concerns that the Fed could raise rates by as much as a
half-percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks, so fears of
a sharper-than-expected increase are likely to hang over the market
until the Fed's next meeting, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people have gone to the sidelines to wait for the
employment data due out Friday,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market
analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ''There's no sense of doom, but
investors are definitely waiting for more data to gauge the
strength of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 652.01 million
shares, ahead of Monday's quiet pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.66 to 518.27.

<HEADLINE> Gephardt Balancing Labor, High Tech  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a private meeting in House Democratic
Leader Dick Gephardt's office this spring, AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney and high-tech-minded lawmakers clashed over legislation
granting more visas to highly skilled foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It had its tense moments,'' one participant said of the
session that ended as it began, with Sweeney opposed to the bill as
written, the Democratic rank and file in favor and their leader
siding with them.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, though, Gephardt cheered labor when he
announced his opposition to higher-profile legislation that would
grant permanent normalized trade relations with China, a measure at
the top of the high-tech agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Together, these events underscore the party leader's attempt to
straddle two worlds -- each with allies within his own caucus -- in
the run-up to fall elections he hopes will restore the Democratic
majority in the House. On the one side is organized labor, longtime
political allies with deep pockets and a proven record in campaign
warfare. On the other is the high-tech industry, the engine for the
new economy and a fresh source of campaign contributions, $1.4
million at one April fund-raiser alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is widespread recognition that Gephardt is really
reaching out to the sector,'' said Phil Bond, a vice president for
the Information Technology Industry Council. ''At the same time,
there's widespread disappointment that he couldn't find a way to
support trade with China.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Elmendorf, Gephardt's chief of staff, responded: ''We try
not with any industry to be 100 percenters. Each industry is
different and sometimes we're with you and sometimes we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a straddle, but I can be nothing but complimentary about
the role that Dick has played on China,'' Rep. Cal Dooley, a
Californian who favors the trade bill, said in an interview before
Gephardt announced his opposition. Dooley is also co-chair of the
New Democrat Coalition, a 64-member group that describes itself as
centrist and pro-growth.
</P>
<P>
   Another co-chair, Rep. Jim Moran of Virginia, credits Gephardt
with a ''watershed'' speech last month in which the Missouri
Democrat pledged support for tax cuts and regulatory relief to keep
''the technology revolution on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans are less charitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gephardt's trying to put a foot in both camps,'' said Rep. Tom
Davis of Virginia, who heads the GOP campaign committee. Davis
noted that Rep. David Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking House
Democrat, is point man for opposition to the China bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''There isn't one New Democrat that's going to be in the
leadership team'' if the Democrats win a House majority'' Davis
chided.
</P>
<P>
   The information technology group's 1999 scorecard gave Gephardt
a 50 percent rating on key issues. Bonior scored 25 percent. Top
House Republicans scored 100 percent. This year's high-tech
scorecard will be weighted to accentuate the importance of the
China bill.
</P>
<P>
   At the AFL-CIO, there's a different view.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative director Peggy Taylor, who attended the meeting in
Gephardt's office with Sweeney, said she hopes for an agreement on
the visa bill. But, she added, ''We're not happy with how the New
Democrats are driving this.''
</P>
<P>
   While the China trade bill is not a litmus test for the fall
campaign, she said, there could be repercussions for Democrats who
support it. ''We're concerned it will overshadow other issues and
it will cause apathy or inclination not to'' vote, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's aides describe his approach on China as a measured
one, and say he will not lobby fellow Democrats. The White House
supports the bill, and his caucus is split roughly 2-1 against it.
</P>
<P>
   Dooley, Moran and others note that Gephardt's attention to
high-tech issues extends beyond the visa bill. A speech last month
showcased support for phasing out a 3 percent federal
telecommunications excise tax; liberalized depreciation rules for
computers; and a permanent extension of the research and
development tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gephardt has met in recent months with high-tech
leaders, touring Amazon.Com facilities, for example. Next week,
House Democrats will host a session for business leaders from
around the country, and Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is invited.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Democrats have aggressively solicited campaign
donations from the high-tech industry. Gephardt and President
Clinton attended a Silicon Valley fund-raiser last month that
brought in $1.4 million for the House Democratic campaign
committee.
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans are pushing back.
</P>
<P>
   GOP officials say Davis and Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., a
leading supporter of trade with China, will meet with high-tech
industry representatives this week to express displeasure that
campaign checks continue to flow to a party whose leadership
opposes the China bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt took their contributions and ''stabbed them in the back
on the issue that matters most to them,'' said Jim Wilkinson, a GOP
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Nichols, Gephardt's spokeswoman, countered, ''We have
never raised money with the idea that you take a donation here and
the legislation comes out over here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt ''assumes that people meet with him and give him money
because they're interested in him as a leader,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka May Be Seeking India Help  </HEADLINE>
By DILSHIKA JAYAMAHA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Sri Lanka's president has asked India
for help in evacuating some 40,000 troops trapped by Tamil Tiger
rebels advancing on their former capital, a television station
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sri Lanka's first appeal has been to India,'' a news report on
Telshan Network said.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian Embassy spokesman in Colombo declined comment on the
TV report, except to say it was ''speculative.'' But an official
close to the embassy, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed
the Sri Lankan government had requested India's aid.
</P>
<P>
   The TV report was broadcast after President Chandrika
Kumaratunga met with opposition leaders to discuss how to prevent
Jaffna, once the center of Tamil culture, from being retaken by the
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The Tamil uprising began in Jaffna in 1983. From 1990-95, the
Tamils ran a virtually independent state in the Jaffna peninsula on
the northern tip of the island. Sri Lankan troops drove the rebels
out of the city of 500,000 people in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The National Sangha Council -- a group of Buddhist monks -- also
has agreed that the Indian military should intervene to prevent the
fall of Jaffna to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
</P>
<P>
   The monks had protested when Indian troops were sent to the
island nation in 1987 to disarm the rebels. But over the weekend
the monks, who are extremely influential in a country where 76
percent of the population is Buddhist, met an Indian envoy and
appealed for Indian military help.
</P>
<P>
   Tamil Tiger rebels, who overran the key Pallai military base
over the weekend, unleashed an intense artillery barrage on the
navy camp Tuesday in a bid to control the sea supply route,
military officials and rebel sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Ministry said its soldiers were holding onto the
camp 15 miles south of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross said the
rebels had handed over the bodies of 42 soldiers killed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The military said 14 officers and soldiers were killed and 222
others were wounded Sunday. The rebel's clandestine Voice of Tigers
Radio said Tuesday that 10 of their combatants died.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists have been barred from the war front and telephone
links to the area have been cut.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas are fighting for a separate homeland. They say
minority Tamils have been discriminated against by the Sinhalese
majority.
</P>
<P>
   India is home to 52 million Tamils, who have ties with Sri
Lanka's 3.2 million Tamils.

<HEADLINE> Examiner Publisher Recants Comment  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco Examiner's publisher
testified that he offered Mayor Willie Brown favorable treatment in
editorials if Brown would support Hearst Corp.'s purchase of the
San Francisco Chronicle. Hours later, the publisher said he
misspoke.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy White testified Monday that he told Brown at a lunch
meeting last August, several weeks after the $660 million purchase
of the Chronicle had been announced, that the mayor could expect
''more favorable treatment'' in Examiner editorials if he supported
the sale.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail afterward to the head of Hearst's newspaper
division and read in court, White said: ''I asked Willie how I was
going to justify to my superiors in New York wanting to support him
and cooperate with him when he was seeming to go out of his way to
make our lives difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   White later recanted his U.S. District Court testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was tired and confused by the question,'' White said in a
statement distributed by Hearst Corp. ''The implication of my
answer that the pages of The Examiner can be influenced, under any
circumstances, is absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst also denied that any special treatment had been offered.
''It is not now -- nor has it ever been -- a policy of the San
Francisco Examiner to trade favorable editorial coverage for any
gains, including political influence,'' Hearst said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst's trial lawyer, Garry Halling, said the lawsuit was
designed ''to make headlines.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What you see in here will be entertaining, often misleading
and untrue. But it will also be largely irrelevant to the antitrust
issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic mayor had no comment on the testimony, his office
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown initially was outspoken against Hearst's plans for the
papers, urging the White House and Justice Department to block the
Chronicle sale until Hearst found a buyer for the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   In the months after his Aug. 30 lunch meeting with White, Brown
worked behind the scenes to support the Examiner sale to the Fang
family, owners of a free local newspaper, even negotiating for a
bigger Hearst subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst eventually agreed to give the Fangs $66 million to take
the paper off its hands.
</P>
<P>
   White was the first witness in a trial on a lawsuit challenging
Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle. The suit was filed by Clint
Reilly, a real estate investor, losing candidate for mayor and
unsuccessful bidder for the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's lawsuit contends Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle was
rigged and that its transfer of the Examiner to a local publisher
is a sham, designed to give Hearst a local newspaper monopoly after
more than a century of competition.
</P>
<P>
   All three publishers -- Hearst, the Chronicle Publishing Co., and
Ted Fang, the prospective publisher of the Examiner -- say their
transactions will promote competition, not destroy it.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department found no antitrust violations in the sale
and approved the dissolution of the joint operating agreement under
which the Chronicle and Examiner have been published since 1965.
The agreement, which combines business operations but keeps
editorial staffs separate, was scheduled to run through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   However, U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker stunned the
publishers by issuing a restraining order against the Chronicle
sale March 30, a day before it was to be completed.
</P>

   In Monday's testimony, White also said he repeatedly warned the
rival Chronicle last year that it faced all-out competition after
the JOA ended in 2005, even though he knew the Examiner was doomed
on its own.
</P>
<P>
   It was part of a ''blowfish theory'' -- inflating oneself to look
fierce -- that the Examiner's owners devised to bluff the larger
Chronicle into returning to negotiations over the two newspapers'
future, White testified.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle is the nation's 14th-largest newspaper with a
circulation more than four times the Examiner's.

heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old band leader left for his home in New York after

<HEADLINE> British Upbeat After Irish Talks  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- British officials detected ''a bit more hope'' for
solving Northern Ireland's political deadlock following a day of
negotiations Tuesday, but couldn't immediately agree with Irish
colleagues on whether to follow up with more talks this week.
</P>
<P>
   No indication was given as to who, if anyone, had given ground
on the intractable issue of paramilitary disarmament, but Britain's
senior official in Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, told
reporters he was ''somewhat encouraged.'' He said all parties had
shown ''a willingness to resolve this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair's office announced he and his
Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, would meet again with Northern
Ireland's parties on Thursday. But two hours later, Ahern told
reporters he was ''not too sure'' whether that would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be more discussions tomorrow on the telephone
between the prime minister and myself and the officials will
probably meet again and we have kept Thursday free for
discussions,'' Ahern said. Blair's office confirmed the two sides
were still discussing the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Ahern met separately with the Ulster Unionists, the
province's main pro-British Protestant party, and the two main
Catholic parties -- Sinn Fein, the party associated with the Irish
Republican Army, and the Social Democratic and Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists' demand for the IRA to disarm and the
outlawed group's refusal to do so led to the suspension of Northern
Ireland's new power-sharing government in February. The new
government was the keystone of the peace agreement concluded on
Good Friday two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams and his delegation were the
first group to arrive at Blair's Downing Street offices Tuesday
morning -- and the last to leave Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got some answers to some issues,'' Adams said. ''We have a
lot more to do and we will continue and our hope is we will come to
a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandelson said that ''the people of Northern Ireland, whose
future depends on these talks and a successful outcome, deserve a
bit more hope. That's what we're giving them today.''
</P>
<P>
   A more downbeat assessment came from David Trimble, leader of
the Ulster Unionists, who insisted the onus was on Sinn Fein and
the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really boils down the question: Are they actually prepared
to do anything?'' Trimble said. ''And they should tell us what they
are prepared to do.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 79; Nasdaq Falls 104  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower today as AT&AMP;T fell
after delivering a cautious profit outlook and investors took
profits from a recent rally in technology shares.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was down 79.34 at 10,732.44.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators also fell. The Nasdaq composite index
was down 104.68 at 3,853.40, its first decline in four sessions.
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 17.63 at 1,450.62.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell 7 1/16 to 41 11/16 after lowering its earnings
forecasts for fiscal year 2000, saying the competitive
long-distance market is cutting into consumer phone revenue. For
the first quarter, AT&AMP;T posted operating profit of $1.73 billion,
or 53 cents per share. That matched the estimates of analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Also, shares of AT&AMP;T's new Wireless Group fell 2 to 32 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mixed after three days of solid gains as
investors took some profits. Microsoft gave up some of its Monday
advance and was down 3 1/4 at 70 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's decline came after Mary Meeker, an influential
technology stock analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said she
believes Microsoft's stock is fairly valued in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Meeker said in a research note she believes the proposal to
break the company in two to satisfy antitrust concerns is an
excessive punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember, we aren't at all opposed to disciplining Microsoft,
but we think a break up is simply too harsh,'' Meeker wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Several other prominent technology stocks rose. Broadcom was up
9 1/8 to 183 3/8 and Qualcomm was up 4 1/2 at 114 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market was fairly quiet, hemmed in by a lack of news
on inflation. The Federal Reserve holds its next policymaking
meeting on May 16, and many investors are expecting the Fed to
raise interest rates by a quarter-percentage point. Recent signs of
booming economic growth have stimulated some concerns that the Fed
could raise rates by as much as a half-percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks, so fears of
a sharper-than-expected increase are likely to hang over the market
until the Fed's next meeting, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people have gone to the sidelines to wait for the
employment data due out Friday,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market
analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ''There's no sense of doom, but
investors are definitely waiting for more data to gauge the
strength of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic surveys released today showed little evidence of a
slowdown to more sustainable levels. The Commerce Department said
new-home sales rose in March to their second-highest level on
record, indicating that Americans are unfazed by rising mortgage
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Conference Board said its Index of Leading Economic
Indicators, which is designed to predict economic activity three to
six months ahead, rose 0.1 percent in March, indicating continued
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 781.27 million
shares, ahead of Monday's quiet pace. On the Nasdaq, decliners led
by an 8-to-5 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 6.51 to 512.42.

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Refugee Returns Are Way Up  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDAR S. DRAGICEVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZEPA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- It took Sabrija Colic five years
to return to his prewar yard -- only to find that he was unable to
cross the threshold into what remained of his house.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning to his village 35 miles east of Sarajevo last
month, the 74-year-old man has spent much of his time sitting on a
stump a few feet from his home's wrecked shell, staring at the
doorstep where two land mines were found. He fears more are inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just sitting here looking at my house, figuring how am I
going to get in. God only knows how many booby-traps are inside,''
Colic said. He sleeps with three neighbors in a tent in his
courtyard in the eastern Bosnian town of Zepa.
</P>
<P>
   Colic is one of an increasing number of refugees who decided to
return to the homes from which they were driven or fled during the
war. In towns and villages across Bosnia, many people, tired of
life as refugees, feel coming home is a matter of now or never.
</P>
<P>
   Colic and about 20 other Bosnian Muslims returned to Zepa in
late April, the first returnees since the entire population -- all
Muslim -- fled when the town fell to the Serbs in 1995 despite being
declared a U.N. ''safe zone.'' One hundred more are to return
Wednesday under NATO escort. Hundreds of people remain missing;
many are believed to have been executed by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pattern being repeated across Bosnia. More than 5,500
people have returned this year, nearly three times the number of
spontaneous returns at this time last year, according to Wendy
Rappeport of the U. N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the war ended in 1995, over a quarter of Bosnia's
prewar population of 4.5 million was displaced. Only 300,000 have
gone home, according to U.N. refugee agency. The others are either
dead, have settled permanently elsewhere, or fear returning to
regions controlled by former enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb half of Bosnia, where Zepa lies, is now governed by
moderates who generally cooperate with international officials
enforcing peace terms calling for ethnic tolerance and diversity,
unlike in the first postwar years, when radical nationalists loyal
to wartime Serb leader Radovan Karadzic -- sought by the U.N. war
crimes tribunal -- held sway.
</P>
<P>
   The other half of Bosnia is governed by Croats and Muslims.
Tensions remain, but there is hope that the change of governments
in neighboring Croatia earlier this year from radical nationalist
to moderate will weaken nationalist Bosnian Croats opposed to
cooperation with Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   From his stump, Colic can see through the holes that were once
doors and windows all the way to the bathroom in the back with the
broken sink and bathtub filled with cracked and broken tiles. He
has no money for repairs, and nothing to eat except the fish he
catches in Zepa creek.
</P>
<P>
   All of Zepa's 700 houses are in ruins, blown up by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. agency has provided blankets and tents for returnees,
but the resources are already strapped.
</P>
<P>
   There is no money for rebuilding the hundreds of thousands of
homes destroyed in Bosnia during the war -- or even for removing
mines from booby-trapped dwellings so that rebuilding can begin.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is able to calculate how much the entire process will
cost. ''I couldn't even begin to answer that because it's not only
rebuilding houses, it's the entire infrastructure that has been
destroyed,'' Rappeport said.
</P>
<P>
   In Zepa's center, next to the destroyed post office, a bunker
built by the Ukrainian troops who guarded the ''safe zone'' is
still standing, a monument to one of the biggest embarrassments for
the United Nations in Bosnia -- empty guarantees that Zepa's
inhabitants would be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''They came to help us, but they betrayed us,'' Hasib Omanovic,
60, said of the United Nations, ''They failed then. They must help
us now.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Begins Dismantling Outposts  </HEADLINE>
Eds: This story was submitted to the Israeli military censor who
ordered a deletion.
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel (AP) -- Army trucks loaded with fences,
mobile homes and parts for water tanks rolled south through this
border town Tuesday as Israel began dismantling outposts in south
Lebanon ahead of its July troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon shelled an Israeli
military base that straddles the border and had already been
partially evacuated. Soldiers and firefighters rushed to put out
fires at the Livneh outpost after the mortar shells hit an oil tank
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Several civilian and army vehicles were also damaged at the
post, 38 miles west of Kiryat Shemona, the main town in the north,
the army spokesman's office said. Some shells landed in Israeli
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah said the attack was in response to Israeli shelling of
the Lebanese village of Baraachit earlier in the day. Israeli
warplanes struck back after a guerrilla attack, firing missiles
into a valley three miles northeast of the outpost. There were no
reports of casualties from any of the exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   As Israel began pulling back from some outposts in the occupied
zone, residents of northern Israel protested attempts to build a
new border fence that would leave their homes on the front line,
fearing infiltrations, bombings and shelling from Lebanese
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is packing up after 18 years of occupation in south
Lebanon and promises to be out by July 7, despite its failure to
work out security arrangements with Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Syria and Lebanon have warned that they will not restrain
anti-Israeli guerrillas after the Israeli pullout if a
comprehensive peace agreement is not worked out beforehand.
Guerrillas have not stated clearly if they will continue
anti-Israeli attacks. Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, then created
the security zone three years later along the frontier to prevent
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the first stages of the withdrawal, an outpost located just
dozens of yards north of Israeli communities was evacuated Monday.
Only a few soldiers and some communications equipment remain at the
site, Israeli army officials said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Some 85 soldiers were also evacuated Monday from the Taibeh
infantry position in the central sector of the zone and equipment
has been removed from the Shreika position in the east, a Lebanese
military official said. It was not immediately known if soldiers
were moved to other bases in Lebanon or to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the Livneh outpost, soldiers and temporary structures
have also been removed from the bases Srefa, inside Lebanon, and
Olesh, on the border, Israeli army officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The army spokesman confirmed forces were getting ready to
withdraw. ''There is activity all the time and this is part of the
preparation for the withdrawal,'' the spokesman's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents in northern Israel said Tuesday that they will prevent
the army from evacuating some key bases inside the occupied zone
near their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We intend to fight for the border even if it means we have to
block the bulldozers with our bodies to prevent the soldiers from
evacuating,'' said Eitan Davidi, a resident of the community of
Margaliot.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen residents protested when army sappers and tractors
came to demarcate the new border at the communal farm of Misgav Am.
The army delayed the work -- dismantling mines and building a new
border fence -- until Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A few houses in Misgav Am encroach on Lebanese soil and will be
dismantled if Israel withdraws to a 1923 international border, as
it has indicated it will do.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the Israeli army said it would resume
participation in an international monitoring committee that reviews
an agreement between Israel and Lebanese guerrillas to avoid
targeting civilians. Israeli officials walked out of the last
committee meeting in February after an Israeli soldier was killed
in what Israel said was a violation of the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Is To Start on Wed.  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- Nearly 12 years have passed since
their mothers, fathers, spouses and children were killed, blown
from the sky over Lockerbie, Scotland. Now, as they arrive for the
trial in the 1988 Pan Am bombing, relatives of some of the 270
victims see the proceeding as their last chance for justice.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they hoped prosecutors in the trial of two Libyans
would finally uncover the full story behind the terrorist plot that
killed their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they aren't found guilty, there's no one left,'' said Susan
Cohen of Cape May Court House, N.J., the mother of 20-year-old
Theodora Cohen, who died in the crash of Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
   The two Libyan defendants go on trial Wednesday at a Scottish
court in the Netherlands, charged with murder and a host of other
crimes in the attack that killed 259 passengers and 11 people on
the ground. Sadness filled Cohen's face as she thought of facing
the two men in court, separated only by a bulletproof glass wall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those who did it should never be forgiven,'' she said after
arriving in Amsterdam on Tuesday from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen American relatives visited the courtroom at Camp
Zeist, an old U.S. Air Force base deemed Scottish territory for the
trial. Between 30 and 40 family members -- Cohen among them -- are
expected to attend the early sessions. Other relatives will watch
the trial on closed-circuit television in Washington, New York,
London and Dumfries, Scotland. Libyan and U.S. government
representatives will also attend, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cohens waited almost a decade for the bombers to be brought
to justice. Then, last year, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah -- described by prosecutors as Libyan intelligence
agents -- were handed over by Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said she hoped the trial would shed light on those who
planned and ordered the bombing. ''These guys are just pawns,'' she
said of the co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who are really responsible are who we are after,''
said Kathleen Flynn of Montville, N.J., whose son, John Patrick
Flynn, was returning on Flight 103 from a European study program.
''Unless it goes further, it isn't justice.''
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing 15,000 witnesses and collecting 180,000
pieces of evidence, prosecutors are convinced they have the
bombers. But defense lawyers have alleged that other terrorist
organizations operating in Europe were responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Early evidence had supported the theory that Iran, seeking
revenge for the accidental downing of an Iranian passenger jet,
contracted the bombing out to a radical Palestinian group. Further
doubts have been raised by reports of prosecution witnesses
changing their testimony and by the resignation in February of the
chief prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am hoping for justice and truth, but I don't think we'll get
either,'' said Rosemary Wolfe, of Alexandria, Va., whose
20-year-old stepdaughter, Miriam, died in the Dec. 21, 1988, terror
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The court will hold sessions almost daily through July 28 before
adjourning until Aug. 22. Witnesses scheduled for the early phases
include British aviation experts and the investigators who went
through the debris of the exploded jetliner after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants have been kept behind a 15-foot concrete wall
topped with electrified wire inside the camp, 40 miles east of
Amsterdam. The site was chosen as neutral territory in a compromise
with Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish officials said the defendants were being treated like
any suspect held in pretrial custody in a Scottish jail. Although
held separately, they are allowed to see each other and receive
family visits. Arrangements were made to accommodate their Islamic
beliefs and to watch Arabic-language television.

<HEADLINE> Corn Rises More; Other Grains Gain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn futures jumped to a 17-month high Tuesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade on rising concerns about drought impact
on crops this year. Other grains also finished mostly higher, while
soybeans fell.
</P>
<P>
   A day after prices of all agricultural commodities soared, corn
pushed to new gains after the latest forecasts called for
temperatures in the 80s in Midwestern growing regions this week,
without significant rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat also climbed, thanks to corn's rise, but gains were
minimal as a result of late profit-taking and a sluggish export
market.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans inched initially to new 17-month highs, but settled
lower for the day amid concerns the higher prices could slow export
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for July delivery rose 1 cent to $2.65} a bushel; July
corn rose 2\ cents to $2.46\ a bushel; July oats were unchanged at
$1.26{ a bushel; July soybeans fell 2\ cents to $5.65{ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
while pork futures were lower.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Time Warner Cable Restoring ABC  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner agreed today to return ABC to its
cable systems, at least temporarily bringing ''Good Morning
America'' and ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' back to the 3.5
million customers who had the channel blacked out because of a
corporate dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The cable company agreed, in effect, to an extension to keep
negotiating with the Walt Disney Co., ABC's corporate parent, until
July 15.
</P>
<P>
   On the company's Manhattan system, an ABC network soap opera
quickly returned to the cable channel 7.
</P>
<P>
   ABC issued a statement saying it was ''gratified that Time
Warner is now making the viewers their first priority.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are broadcasters and until yesterday had provided
uninterrupted service to all viewers for 47 years. Wanting to
restore service as quickly as possible to those who depend on us,
we, too, are willing to compromise,'' ABC said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the first day of the ''Millionaire'' show's series of
celebrity guest editions, Time Warner customers in New York hoping
to see host Regis Philbin found a message saying, ''Disney has
taken ABC away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   The lost viewers didn't put much of a dent in the
''Millionaire'' juggernaut Monday, though. The celebrity version of
the show drew an estimated 35 million viewers nationally, based on
overnight ratings that were more than double any other show on the
air, said Marc Berman, an analyst for Mediaweek.com.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 500,000 to 1 million more viewers would have
probably watched if they hadn't been shut out by the dispute, he
said. The show has averaged 28.4 million viewers for its regular
editions this year, according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Co., ABC's corporate parent, is fighting over
how much money Time Warner must compensate Disney for the right to
carry some of its cable channels. The blackout comes during one of
the key ''sweeps'' periods for ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The affected customers were in seven markets served by ABC-owned
television stations. About 1.5 million were in the New York City
area, 665,000 in Houston and 440,000 in Raleigh-Durham, N.C.
Smaller numbers of customers in the Los Angeles; Philadelphia;
Toledo, Ohio; and Fresno, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has been marked by unusually bitter rhetoric, and
Time Warner had offered to reimburse customers for the cost of
switching to an antenna for ABC shows. Disney was considering
giving a rebate to customers who get a satellite dish.
</P>
<P>
   The blackout was particularly ill-timed for ABC, America's
top-rated broadcaster. In addition to the ''Millionaire'' celebrity
week, many viewers who saw the opening night of the miniseries
''Arabian Nights'' on Sunday couldn't see its conclusion Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If the temporary reprieve hadn't been announced, customers could
have missed the Kentucky Derby, the Daytime Emmy Awards and
virtually all of the season finales of its regular series.
</P>
<P>
   In Raleigh, N.C., Dave and Connie Westfall went to a Radio Shack
on Monday to buy a rabbit-ear antenna set.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm furious,'' Connie Westfall said. ''I can't believe it. But
now that I have this, we can watch Regis.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney appealed for help from the Federal Communications
Commission on Monday. The commission had asked Time Warner to
respond to the petition filed by ABC by the end of the day today so
that the agency could conduct an expedited review of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Each side said FCC law was on its side: Time Warner said it was
against the law to carry a station without a transmission deal
while ABC said a cable operator cannot stop airing a broadcast
station during a sweeps period.
</P>
<P>
   Disney had offered a series of deadline extensions after the
original national transmission deal expired Dec. 31. The most
recent deadline, offered in March, expired at 12:01 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner said Disney's demands to carry the Disney Channel
and separate cartoon and soap opera networks on its system would
have added $300 million in costs to its customers; Disney said it
had offered a fair market price.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's abundantly clear to anybody who understands the real
situation -- this is about extorting money from cable customers,''
said Michael Luftman, Time Warner spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Padden, executive vice president of governmental
relations at Disney, said it was a ''damnable lie'' to blame Disney
for pulling the plug.
</P>
<P>
   Since the blackout affected less than 4 percent of the nation's
100 million TV homes, the dispute isn't likely to shake ABC's hold
on the top spot in the season's ratings, said Jon Mandel, an
analyst for Grey Advertising. But advertisers are expected to
demand ABC compensate them for the lost customers.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time such a dispute has deprived cable
customers of their favorite stations, said Simon Applebaum, senior
editor of Cablevision magazine. Earlier this year, a fight left
some 400,000 Cox Communications customers in the Washington, D.C.,
area without the Fox network for a week.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Pres. Chavez Leads Poll  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Just one day after President Hugo
Chavez kicked off his re-election bid, a poll released Tuesday
shows him with a 21-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The survey conducted by the private Datanalisis firm found that,
out of 1,200 people interviewed, 54 percent said they would vote
for Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   His closest rival, Francisco Arias Cardenas, garnered 33 percent
support in the poll. Arias, a former military leader, once helped
Chavez stage a failed coup attempt in 1992, but now accuses the
president of abandoning the ideals behind their rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, conducted April 14-18, gave a 2.8 percent margin of
error.
</P>
<P>
   This results were announced just after Chavez and Arias launched
their election campaigns Monday, both candidates talking tough in
speeches before thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez was elected in December 1998, but comes up for
re-election on May 28 under a new constitution he pushed through
last year. The constitution called for new balloting to
''re-legitimize'' most public offices, including the presidency,
governorships and congress.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is not associated with Venezuela's old political
guard, Arias is seen as the only real challenger to Chavez, who
managed to virtually erase most of the country's traditional
political parties, blamed by most Venezuelans for the massive
poverty in this oil-rich nation of 23 million.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poll shows Chavez continues to garner the strongest
support among Venezuela's poor and working class, while Arias'
backers tend to be from the middle and upper classes.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent polls show the difference between Chavez and Arias
to be as little as four points. The reason for the wide discrepancy
in poll results was not immediately clear.

<HEADLINE> NY voters don't like Gore or media in Elian Gonzalez case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York voters don't much like the way Vice
President Al Gore or the news media handled the Elian Gonzalez
case, a statewide poll reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   By a 44 percent to 24 percent margin, voters surveyed by the
Quinnipiac College Polling Institute said they disapproved of the
way Gore handled the case.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president, the presumptive Democratic presidential
nominee, had called for Congress to grant the Cuban boy permanent
resident status and said the case should be handled by Family
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Clinton administration and Attorney General Janet
Reno have sought to have the case kept in federal court. She
ordered the boy's forced removal by armed officers from the home of
his Miami relatives on April 22. Elian has since been staying with
his father in the Washington area as the court case proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five percent of New York voters said Elian should go
back to Cuba with his father. Sixteen percent said he should stay
in this country with his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-nine percent of voters said ''appropriate'' force was used
in removing the boy from the Miami home where he had been living
while 36 percent said excessive force was employed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their disapproval of Gore's handling of the Elian
Gonzalez case, the vice president still leads Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, 52 percent to 36 percent, among New York voters asked about
the presidential race. That is statistically unchanged from an
April poll from the Hamden, Conn.-based institute that had Democrat
Gore leading Republican Bush, 53 percent to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The voters were even harsher in their feelings about the news
media's coverage of the Elian Gonzalez case. Seventy-two percent
said they disapproved while 22 percent approved.
</P>
<P>
   Voters approved of Reno's handling of the case, 54 percent to 38
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tough stuff seems to work,'' said Maurice Carroll, director of
the polling institute. ''Janet Reno is a winner for seizing
Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   The telephone poll of 952 registered voters was conducted April
24-30 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

U.S. Warships Wait Off Vieques
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- With a showdown looming over the U.S. Navy's
prime Atlantic training ground, protesters who have blocked bombing for over a
year said today that federal agents would have to arrest them to clear the range
but promised they wouldn't fight back. Scores of Puerto Ricans kept a vigil at
the main gate to the restricted Navy compound on Vieques Island, jeering at
soldiers in passing Humvees. The range has been occupied by protesters since a
civilian security guard was killed by stray bombs in April 1999, releasing
pent-up frustrations throughout Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory of 4 million
people.

sirens wailed across Israel, bringing the country to a standstill for two
minutes to reflect on the horrors of the Nazi genocide. In towns and villages,
at work and at play, people stopped in their tracks when sirens went off this
morning for Holocaust Remembrance Day. In the Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat,
negotiators interrupted peace treaty talks and stood in silence. The chief
Israeli negotiator, Oded Eran, said he appreciated the gesture of his
Palestinian colleagues, saying it was a sign of good will.

Conclusions in College Bonfire Collapse

	   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Inadequate wiring of logs and weak oversight

panel, disclosing the findings of its probe into the collapse that killed 12
people last November, blamed school officials and students involved in the
construction of the bonfire for contributing to the disaster. But the panel said
drinking and student horseplay did not play a significant role in the accident.

Confederate Flag Debaters Face Gap
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The dispute over the Confederate flag flying over the
Statehouse has exposed a generation gap in the ranks of South Carolina's civil
rights leaders. Some veterans of the struggles of the 1960s support a deal under
which the flag would be moved to a less conspicuous spot on the Statehouse
grounds. But a younger generation of blacks wants the flag removed altogether
and says the older leaders are too willing to compromise. The state Senate
agreed April 13 to lower the flag as long as it is raised again above a monument
to Confederate war dead on the Statehouse grounds. The House could vote as early
as next week.

"It seemed like the ball was in the air for five minutes. I got to see the boats
go after the ball." Bonds' sixth-inning, three-run shot off New York's Rich

plopping into McCovey Cove.

   THIS YEAR'S RAISES: A survey by the American Compensation
Association found that companies' average budgets for salaries are
expected to rise in the 4 percent range this year, the same as in
1999, and will remain at that level in 2001. That means workers'
salaries aren't keeping up with inflation, which has risen at an
annual rate of 5.8 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that nonexempt hourly nonunion workers (they
receive straight pay for overtime hours) and nonexempt salaried
workers can expect an average 4.2 percent salary increase this year
and next. Exempt salaried workers can expect a 4.4 percent raise
each year, and officers and executives can expect a 4.6 percent
salary increase in 2000 and 4.7 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The percentages covers base salary. Some employees' overall
compensation packages have been bolstered further by benefits such
as stock options.

   A TIGHTER JOB MARKET?: College students hoping for jobs on Wall
Street after graduation might find the market is tighter than they
expect.

   ''Wall Street's Black Friday upheaval had to cause a rethinking

officer of Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, a Chicago-based employment
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Record plunges in the Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq
composite index on April 14 seems to have made employers more
nervous about current economic trends and more likely to be extra
selective while hiring. According to Challenger, there's already
evidence that it's taking graduates longer to find a job.

   E-DEMOCRACY: Democracy is going digital. A telephone survey of

   Twelve percent of the households that took part in the survey
have used the Web to communicate with a government official within
the past 12 months, and 7 percent have signed an Internet petition
requesting the government to make a change in policy.

<P>
   The survey also found that nearly a third of the households
surveyed would be much more likely to vote in local, state or
federal election if it could be done over the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Armenian President Dismisses Govt.  </HEADLINE>
By AVET DEMOURIAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) -- President Robert Kocharian fired
Armenia's prime minister and his government Tuesday and tightened
police security around government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read on national television, Kocharian said he
dismissed Prime Minister Aram Sarkisian -- whose predecessor died in
a parliament shootout -- for allowing the former Soviet republic's
economy to deteriorate and ignoring discord in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently fearing unrest, Kocharian stepped up police presence
around government buildings and the headquarters of the Unity
Party, which has a majority in parliament and has shown increasing
dissatisfaction with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ''Political games of some (Cabinet) ministers became a way of
life, while economic problems snowballed,'' Kocharian said. ''Such
developments threaten to bring about the disintegration of the
army, ... a halt of investments and a drop in the country's
authority on the international scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between Kocharian and the government have mounted since
Sarkisian took office in November and named a few controversial
figures to Cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
   According to Armenia's constitution, with the firing of the
prime minister, the government was also automatically dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Kocharian did not immediately name a new premier. He did replace
Defense Minister Vagarshak Arutyunian with Deputy Defense Minister
Mikhail Arutyunian, who is reportedly more loyal to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Sarkisian's predecessor and brother, Vazgen Sarkisian, was
killed when gunmen burst into parliament Oct. 27. The gunmen took
legislators hostage, saying they were trying to save the country
from corruption. Sarkisian, the parliament speaker and six others
were killed in a shootout before the gunmen surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   After assuming office, Aram Sarkisian pledged to improve the
country's lagging economy and boost exports. He has met with top
U.S. and Russian officials about investment and trade.
</P>
<P>
   Kocharian, a nationalist and technocrat, has had three
governments since he won presidential elections in 1998 in this
mountainous country of 3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Anger with Kocharian has been building, and some legislators
have called for his impeachment, accusing him of barring a
prosecutor from hearings on the parliament massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Communist lawmaker Khoren Sarkisian criticized Kocharian's
dismissal of the government, and the legislator said he would
collect signatures to launch impeachment proceedings.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Militants Raid Russian Posts  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SLEPTSOVSKAYA, Russia (AP) -- Chechen militants attacked eight
Russian posts Tuesday, narrowly missing a top Russian official,
while Russian jets and helicopters pounded rebel positions in
southern Chechnya, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Koshman, the Russian government's chief envoy for
Chechnya, left a military command post about 10 minutes before the
post came under fire from rebels with grenade launchers, military
spokesmen said. No casualties were reported at the post in the
mountain town of Shatoi.
</P>
<P>
   The post was one of eight Russian checkpoints or police stations
shot at by rebel gunmen Tuesday, the Interior Ministry press center
in Chechnya said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. The
central military commandant's office in Grozny was hit overnight,
killing one Russian soldier, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered rebel attacks have continued for weeks despite
Russia's claim to control most of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Koshman said Russia would mine all approaches to
electric power plants in Chechnya to prevent plundering of metals.
</P>
<P>
   Metal thefts from electric plants and oil refineries have cost
Chechnya's Moscow-backed administrators tens of thousands of
dollars, Koshman told reporters. Maj. Gen. Vasily Prizemlin, the
military commandant in Grozny, said Russian forces had shot 20
people trying to smuggle out metals from plants around the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring electricity and basic services to Chechnya is a huge,
expensive challenge for the Russians. The republic's infrastructure
was devastated by Chechnya's 1994-6 separatist war and had not been
rebuilt by the time Moscow launched its latest offensive last
September.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian Su-25 attack jets and Su-24 bombers flew
combat missions striking at targets in the Argun gorge, a key rebel
refuge, and near the border with Georgia, the military command said
Tuesday. Russia claims that arms and fighters slip across the
mountainous border from Georgia to join the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is trying to trap rebels in the republic's nearby
southern mountains and finish them off. The rebels, although
outnumbered and outgunned, have resisted fiercely.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees continued to flee areas under Russian air and artillery
bombardment. One, Aslambek Ibragimov, tried to go home to Grozny
but returned to a refugee camp in neighboring Ingushetia because,
he said, he was forced to bribe Russian soldiers at every
checkpoint on the road home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was stopped by a riot police officer who demanded a fine
because I had an expired pollution inspection sticker,'' Ibragimov
said Tuesday. ''I asked him where could I get my car inspected in a
destroyed city. 'It's not my problem,' was his answer.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Colombia Aid Helps Others  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and many other countries
would benefit from a proposed multibillion dollar aid package to
help Colombia rid itself of the drug culture that grips its economy
and national life, President Clinton said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every one of you here has a deep and abiding interest in
helping to see that the fight for freedom, democracy and good
government in Colombia is successful,'' Clinton said during an
afternoon address to Latin American diplomats and policy experts.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is asking the United States and European countries to
contribute $3.5 billion to a $7.5 billion plan to fight drug
trafficking in Colombia. Clinton wants Congress to approve $1.7
billion in U.S. aid this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised Colombia's president, Andres Pastrana, as brave,
forward-thinking and committed to democracy. But in a State
Department address to members of the international Council of the
Americas, Clinton warned that drug crime and violence could undo
Pastrana's advances.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet and other communications advances will only make
the drug lords more powerful and interconnected, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must not stand by and allow a democracy elected by its
people, defended with great courage by people who have given their
lives, (to) be undermined and overwhelmed by those who literally
are willing to tear the country apart for their own agenda,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And make no mistake about it, if the oldest democracy in South
America can be torn down, so can others.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1.7 billion anti-narcotics aid package passed the House in
March but has stalled in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States want to do its part,'' Clinton said as he
issued another appeal for congressional passage. ''It's very much
in our interest to do so,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Want Limited U.S. Role  </HEADLINE>
By DANA BUDEIRI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EILAT, Israel (AP) -- U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross arrived at
another round of Mideast peace talks Tuesday and found that the
tables have turned -- Israel said it would accept any U.S. role to
help strike a peace deal, but the Palestinians said they want
limited American involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the Palestinians had called for U.S. mediation while
Israel consistently said differences should be worked out without
Washington's help. The reason for the change was not immediately
clear. However, at times the Palestinians have expressed concern
that the United States is siding with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Ross met a hostile reception outside the hotel at the Red Sea
resort of Eilat where Israel and the Palestinians are holding
talks. A group of about 40 Jewish settlers opposed to the
negotiations shouted ''Dennis Ross, go home,'' as he went past.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. envoy attended some of the previous negotiating
sessions at Bolling Air Force Base near Washington, but was not an
active participant. However, the United States has said it would
step up its involvement, including presenting its own proposals, to
help the two sides formulate a framework for a peace treaty. Such a
framework is due this month, while a final treaty is due in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Formal peace talks were not scheduled to resume until Wednesday.
But U.S. officials confirmed that Ross met with Israel's chief
negotiator, Oded Eran, upon his arrival at the Eilat airport and
was scheduled to meet with the Palestinian negotiators later
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Since peace treaty talks began in November, negotiators have not
achieved breakthroughs on difficult issues such as the final
borders of a Palestinian state, the status of Jerusalem, the fate
of Palestinian refugees and the future of Jewish settlements in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. Still, Eran was upbeat Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there was always progress, and this week, there was
progress as well,'' the Israeli negotiator told reporters. ''Of
course, not everything can be completed in two or three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Only informal talks were held Tuesday in deference to Holocaust
Remembrance Day, when Israel pays tribute to the 6 million Jews who
perished in the Nazi genocide. Eran said he appreciated that his
Palestinian colleagues got up from their seats and stood in silent
tribute along with the Israeli negotiators when a siren sounded for
two minutes Tuesday morning in memory of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to mention that the Palestinian delegation expressed
its feelings very clearly. I think that this is a
confidence-building measure,'' Eran said. In the past, Israelis and
Palestinians have often accused each other of refusing to
acknowledge the other side's suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Ross' mission, Eran said that ''any role the United
States will carry out will be acceptable to both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said he envisioned
limited U.S. involvement in the talks. He said Ross should only
help the two sides implement U.N. resolutions 242 and 338, which
urge Israel to withdraw from land occupied in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians demand that Israel withdraw from all of the
West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, the areas captured in
1967. Israel has presented its own interpretation, saying the
resolutions don't require it to give up all the land.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both sides were trying to arrange a meeting between
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, said a Palestinian official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. Frequent summit meetings are expected to accompany the
negotiations, since only Barak and Arafat can make decisions about
the complex issues on the table.
</P>
<P>
   The current round of talks began Sunday. In alternating
sessions, negotiators have discussed the treaty framework and the
scope of an interim Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank -- the
last one before final borders are drawn.

<HEADLINE> Comedian Carl Reiner Receives Award  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Comedian Carl Reiner said receiving the
Kennedy Center's ''Mark Twain'' Award is the fulfillment of a
lifelong fascination with Samuel Clemens, the 19th-century humorist
who wrote under the pen name ''Mark Twain.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't a big reader as a kid,'' Reiner said from his Los
Angeles home on Tuesday, when the award was announced. ''But for
some reason I liked to read Mark Twain.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when fans asked the Jewish comedian why he thought ''all
the Jews seemed to be the funny ones,'' Reiner said he always
pointed to the 19th-century author. ''Clemens isn't a Jewish name --
is it?''
</P>
<P>
   When Reiner appeared on the television show ''This is Your
Life'' in 1960, the producers wanted to give him a car as a gift,
but his wife vetoed the idea in favor of surefire winner -- a
collection of vintage autographed Twain tomes that Reiner treasures
to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Now Reiner can add a bronze bust of the famous author to his
collection of Twain memorabilia. ''When I get that bust, it's going
right next to the books,'' said Reiner.
</P>
<P>
   The awards ceremony will take place this fall, with proceeds to
benefit the Kennedy Center's Education Department's programs for
young humorists.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner will be the third winner of the award. Previous winners
were seventies icon Richard Pryor in 1998 and comic actor Jonathan
Winters last year.

<HEADLINE> GOP Is Newly Wary on Elian Hearings  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican leaders expressed new reservations
Tuesday over whether to hold congressional hearings on the Elian
Gonzalez raid.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know the answer to whether or not a hearing will be
necessary,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, whose Senate Judiciary
Committee had originally announced hearings this week, indicated
he's still awaiting requested documents from the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   In a taunting statement, Hatch suggested the agency may have
been too busy preparing Attorney General Janet Reno ''for several
appearances on television news and entertainment programs'' to
respond to his request for documents.
</P>
<P>
   His statement was issued just after the airing of Reno's
appearance on Oprah Winfrey's talk show in Chicago -- and brought a
quick response from the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''The attorney general's appearance on Oprah had no bearing on
the department's ability to gather the documents for the Judiciary
Committee,'' spokeswoman Carole Florman responded.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said, ''let's just be serious
here, and let's cut out the rhetoric. The Justice Department is
moving in an appropriate way to provide the appropriate documents
to the committee.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there are very few people in this city who believe
that their postponing of the hearing has anything to do with
documents arriving on the Hill,'' said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hatch's jab at Reno, Republican leaders in both chambers
seemed to have far less enthusiasm for hearings than they did just
a week ago. Then, both House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., announced inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Lott even suggested that the boy's Cuban father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, might be among those called to testify before the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown that most Americans approved of the
administration's tactics in wresting the six-year-old shipwreck
survivor from the home of his Miami relatives and returning him to
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Lott told reporters on Tuesday that he still believed there
should be hearings.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, they should be ''sharply focused,'' and of one or
two days duration at most.
</P>
<P>
   ''It never was intended to be an ongoing, protracted hearing,''
Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he agreed with Hatch that ''the responsible way to
proceed is to at least have the documents before you go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey said Elian's pre-dawn capture late last month was a
''pretty frightening picture'' and ''there are serious questions
that have to be asked about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll sit down and talk about it. I think perhaps we'll do
some communications with the agency and see if we can't get
answers,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ''I don't know the answer to whether or not a
hearing will be necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hastert's behest, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., ordered a preliminary inquiry by committee staff into
the tactics used by the Justice Department in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   He has not yet scheduled hearings, however.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had a lot of hearings on a lot of different subjects and
we have people that have not been very forthcoming. I think we need
to try some inquiries ... and see where it takes us,'' Armey said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Euro; Down Vs. Yen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro fell against the dollar on Tuesday,
approaching the all-time low that it hit last week amid concerns
that European authorities will not take aggressive steps to boost
the troubled currency.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 90.73 cents,
down from 91.72 cents late Monday. During intraday trading on
Tuesday, it fell as low as 90.35 cents, just above the record low
of 90.30 cents reached on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also was quoted at 108.48 Japanese yen, down from
108.79 yen late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The euro has been under selling pressure for the last week, and
analysts said they did not foresee an immediate rebound for the
single currency of 11 European nations that was launched in January
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts blame the euro's troubles on the strength of the
U.S. economy, which has attracted money from Europe that investors
might otherwise have put into European stocks. This outflow of
funds has caused the dollar to strengthen and has undermined the
euro.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts that European authorities would rally around a strategy
to stimulate growth and make Europe a more attractive place to
invest have added to the currency's woes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The overall general mood is not favoring the euro right now,''
said Kevin Lawrie, foreign exchange manager for Mellon Bank in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar was slightly weaker against the yen in light trading
Tuesday, a day after rallying to a two-month high against the
Japanese currency. Analysts said they expect trading to remain slow
for rest of the week, with Japanese markets closed Wednesday to
Friday for the Golden Week holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar also was quoted at 1.7184 Swiss francs, up from
1.7056, and 1.4850 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4787. The British
pound rose to $1.5596 from $1.5535.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.1559 German
marks, up from 2.1326; 7.2306 French francs, up from 7.1525; and
2,134.34 Italian lire, up from 2,111.29.

<HEADLINE> UN Warns of Pakistan, Afghan Drought  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- The United Nations on Tuesday warned
of a crisis in drought-ravaged Pakistan and Afghanistan, where
thousands are on the move in search of water and entire animal
herds have died.
</P>
<P>
   Eric de Mul, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Afghanistan,
told a news conference in Islamabad that an urgent appeal was
issued Tuesday for $1.8 million for Afghanistan people.
</P>
<P>
   The situation in Pakistan's Baluchistan and Sindh provinces is
''very critical,'' said Onder Yucer, the U.N. representative in
Pakistan. ''We have the dislocation of people and losses of
livestock,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the aid to the worst-hit areas of Pakistan has been
provided by the government, but Yucer said a request for
international aid is expected to go out within days.
</P>
<P>
   Zakir Hussain, a representative of Pakistan's Ministry of
Agriculture, said that half a million people over 2 million acres
of Pakistan's southwestern Baluchistan province suffered from a
shortage of water and 2.5 million people were affected in Sindh
province.
</P>
<P>
   In India's western states of Rajasthan and Gujarat, the drought
has affected more than 50 million people and killed thousands of
cows, goats and buffaloes. Even camels have died.
</P>
<P>
   In the only confirmed human death from the drought, a ticket
collector died from heat stroke Friday in India at the Titlagarh
train station in Orissa state, where temperatures reached 118
degrees last week.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people in western India have fled their
homes to nearby towns, where government water tankers and trains
distribute emergency supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty million people in nine other Indian states face water
shortages, the Indian government said last week.
</P>
<P>
   In Afghanistan, the people suffering most are the Koochis, or
nomads, who have lost up to 80 percent to 90 percent of their
herds, said Terence Barker, a spokesman for the U.N.'s Food and
Agriculture Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are looking at the worst drought since 1971 in
Afghanistan,'' Barker said.
</P>
<P>
   De Mul of the United Nations said the ruling Taliban have
relocated tens of thousands of people, mostly nomads, to areas with
water, flew in helicopters loaded with water and provided trucks to
move cattle to water.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Taliban authorities have made a very serious effort to
reach out and help,'' de Mul said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Food Program is feeding as many as 400,000 people and
is trying to get fodder for livestock.
</P>
<P>
   De Mul said the United Nations will seek international aid to
Afghanistan avoid a reoccurrence of drought, including money to
rebuild the irrigation infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   But the international community has been reluctant to give aid
to the hard-line Taliban army, complaining about its human rights
record and refusal to hand over suspected terrorist Osama bin
Laden.

<HEADLINE> Aid Convoy Ambushed in Angola  </HEADLINE>
By CASIMIRO SIONA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- Some 300 gunmen attacked a U.S.-chartered
aid convoy as it traveled through a rural area, killing a driver
and injuring two others, a U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
   The ambush took place Sunday in the coastal province of Benguela
along a road that links Lobito to Cubal, 250 miles south of the
capital, Luanda, according to a U.N. official who asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers of the first three trucks were caught in the ambush
when the attackers, who wore UNITA rebel uniforms, opened fire from
both sides of the road, the official said by phone.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were all Angolans.
</P>
<P>
   The last truck managed to escape and return to the provincial
capital, also named Benguela.
</P>
<P>
   The trucks, chartered by U.S. aid group Catholic Relief
Services, were carrying 48 tons of food provided by the U.N. World
Food Program for displaced people in Cubal.
</P>
<P>
   Angola's civil war, which resumed in December 1998, has
drastically limited access by international aid groups to only a
few provinces in the southwestern African nation.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling outside government-held areas is dangerous. UNITA
often stages hit-and-run attacks, while armed bandits roam the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
   The government and UNITA, a Portuguese acronym for the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola, began fighting after
Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Pastrana Aid Offers To Resign  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- President Andres Pastrana's chief of
staff offered to resign Tuesday, accused by opposition lawmakers of
profiting from his post by awarding government contracts to
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Hernandez's offer was the latest twist in a political
battle between Pastrana's government and the opposition Liberal
party over corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez denied wrongdoing, noting that the business in
question -- owned by his wife's family -- has been selling uniforms
to Colombia's police for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential spokesman said Pastrana had not yet accepted
Hernandez's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   On March 30, Pastrana announced he would hold a referendum to
dissolve Congress and hold elections for a new legislature after
the discovery of fictitious contracts worth $2.7 million by the
House of Representatives. Last week, $1.5 more million in
questionable contracts were discovered in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal lawmakers, who hold a majority in both houses, contend
that the executive branch is more corrupt and have called for
replacing the executive in the proposed referendum.

<HEADLINE> Gannett chairman to step down as CEO; replacement named  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gannett chairman and chief executive officer
John Curley will step down as CEO on June 1. He will be replaced by
current vice chairman and president Douglas McCorkindale.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was announced at a Gannett shareholders meeting on
Tuesday at the company's Arlington, Va., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Curley, 61, will retain the title of chairman through early next
year, according to a Gannett spokeswoman. McCorkindale will assume
the title of chairman at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doug McCorkindale and I have worked together for almost 30
years,'' Curley said. ''I am extremely confident Gannett will
continue to prosper under his leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Curley, a former reporter and editor at three New Jersey
newspapers now owned by Gannett and a former reporter in New Jersey
for The Associated Press, joined Gannett in 1969. He has been CEO
since 1986, and chairman since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Curley started his journalism career at the AP, working nights
and weekends at the news cooperative in New York before obtaining a
master's degree at Columbia University in 1963. He worked for the
AP in New Jersey after graduation from 1963 to 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Curley worked as a reporter for the Asbury Park Press of Neptune
and an editor for the Perth Amboy Evening News, now the Home News
Tribune of East Brunswick, from 1967 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1969, he joined Gannett as suburban editor of the
Rochester, N.Y., Times-Union and returned to New Jersey as editor
of The Courier-News in Bridgewater in June 1970. He was publisher
and president from August 1971 to February 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Curley ran Gannett News Service in Washington from 1974 to 1980
and then was publisher of the News-Journal in Wilmington, Del.,
before returning to Washington in 1982 to become the first editor
of USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, he became president of the Gannett newspaper division
and a member of the Gannett board of directors. A year later, he
became president and chief operating officer of the company, and in
1986 he became chief executive officer of Gannett, continuing as
president.
</P>
<P>
   When then chairman Allen H. Neuharth retired in April 1989,
Curley took his place. He remained president until September 1997,
when McCorkindale got the job.
</P>
<P>
   Curley, a 1960 graduate of Dickinson College, served as a
lieutenant in the U.S. Army before getting his master's degree from
Columbia University in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkindale, 60, has been with Gannett since 1971. In 1977, he
became a senior vice president for finance and law, and a member of
Gannett's board of directors. Two years later, he became Gannett's
chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, McCorkindale also became executive vice president and
president of the company's diversified media division. A year
later, he was named vice chairman of the board, continuing as CFO.
In 1997, he became Gannett's president. He is a graduate of
Columbia University and its law school.

<HEADLINE> Two teens die in fiery suicide at scene of brother's death  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST HADDAM, Conn. (AP) -- There were no skid marks in front of
the tree.
</P>
<P>
   The two teen-age boys who drove a Ford Bronco straight at the
giant spruce and died in a fiery crash early Monday had made clear
their terrible intentions in cell phone goodbyes a few minutes
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Tell our parents we love them, the boys told friends.
</P>
<P>
   Then -- at the same tree where his 15-year-old brother died in a
car crash six months ago -- 13-year-old Michael Dombrowski and his
15-year-old friend Jeffrey Barton ended their lives in this town
about 20 miles from Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said a grief-stricken Michael had planned his death as a
tribute to the elder brother he idolized. He was too young even to
drive. Jeff, whom friends described as troubled, joined Michael out
of friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ''This just created a situation where we're starting to ask
ourselves, 'Why East Haddam?''' said School Superintendent Steven
Durham.
</P>
<P>
   The tree, which stood on the lawn at the First Church of Christ,
was cut down Monday afternoon for fear it would become a magnet for
more suicides.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders had planned to cut it down sooner, but had left
it standing as a memorial to Daniel Dombrowski and Hunter Daniels,
both 15, who died Nov. 6 when a car driven by a third teen-ager
struck the tree. The driver of that car, 19-year-old Jason Duplin,
faces two charges of manslaughter with a motor vehicle while
intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   State police believe Michael and Jeff had been planning the
suicides for some time, but it is not clear how long, when their
friends found out or whether any adults were informed, said Sgt.
Stephen Ostroski.
</P>
<P>
   A friend, Kaitlin Mullarkey, had written them a note urging them
to find some other way to show their love for Daniel, The Hartford
Courant reported. ''I don't know why they felt like they had to do
this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday night, after making calls to a number of friends,
the boys took Michael's father's Bronco. Shortly after 3 a.m.
Monday, after making additional calls from the car -- at one point
telling friends that they had taken some pills to dull the pain of
the crash -- they steered the SUV toward the tree.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of the crash, one of the boys may have been on the
phone with a girlfriend, Ostroski said.
</P>
<P>
   Police don't know how fast they were going. But the vehicle
burst into flames and was destroyed. Pieces of metal and glass were
melted into the surface of the road.
</P>
<P>
   The inferno was so intense that fire marshals are investigating
the possibility that the boys had loaded the car with flammable
materials.
</P>
<P>
   The medical examiner's office ruled the deaths suicides Tuesday.
The boys' families have declined to comment.

   ''It's always an unfortunate event when youths have permanent
solutions to temporary problems,'' Ostroski said.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide is the third-highest cause of death for people ages 15
to 24, and the fourth-highest among children ages 10 to 14. The
suicide rate for children in the lower age group has more than
doubled over the last 10 years, according to the American
Foundation for Suicide Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many worries for officials and residents is the
specter of copycat suicides. Counselors were at the Nathan Hale-Ray
Middle School on Tuesday, along with experts from a state hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nichols, an East Haddam resident with six children in the
school system, discussed the deaths with his own son and said the
boy didn't know what to think.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're the ones trying to figure out what went wrong,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> British Council Giving Cash To Film  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The British Film Council unveiled plans Tuesday to
pump $35 million into the country's movie business, saying it no
longer can be a ''cottage industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The council, launched April 1 as a successor to several public
film bodies, outlined plans to build on Britain's film-making links
with Europe and the United States to produce popular releases while
also nurturing new talent and less commercial projects.
</P>
<P>
   It has a budget of $240 million over three years. Some $16
million of the money -- a combination of government and lottery
funds -- will be channeled into funding mainstream films that have a
''real chance of finding bigger audiences,'' said Alan Parker, the
council's chairman and the director of ''Evita'' and ''Angela's
Ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea here is to move away from the cottage industry that
we all currently work in,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the money will go projects such as funds for
screenwriters and for low-budget and experimental films and a plan
to give children access to low-cost digital filmmaking equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also calls for stronger links with European producers
and an expansion of the British film office in Los Angeles in a bid
to attract more Hollywood funding.
</P>
<P>
   Since the advent of arts funding from the National Lottery in
1994, more than $160 million has been pumped into British films and
the number of movies produced in the country has skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   But the quality of the results has come in for criticism, and
few of the films have made a profit. Parker told The Sunday Times
that Britain made ''too many movies'' with sometimes ''shabby''
scripts.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are too many people with a T-shirt saying 'I want to
direct,''' he told the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Chief Federal Judge Faces Probe  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a rare step, a judicial panel has hired a
former U.S. attorney to investigate why the chief federal judge in
Washington specially assigned the cases of presidential friends to
judges appointed by President Clinton, legal sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Joe D. Whitley, a Republican who served in the Reagan and Bush
administrations as a prosecutor in Georgia and Washington, will
conduct the investigation of U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway
Johnson, according to the legal sources, who spoke only on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Whitley will work for the five-judge panel that is overseeing a
misconduct complaint against Johnson to determine why she bypassed
the normal random case assignment system in a half dozen
prosecutions in the fund-raising and Whitewater investigations.
</P>
<P>
   In each instance, Johnson, a Democratic appointee, sent cases to
judges appointed by Clinton, and in one instance she urged federal
prosecutors to request a specific judge appointed by him.
</P>
<P>
   The cases included those of presidential friends Webster
Hubbell, a Whitewater figure, and Charlie Trie, a key Clinton
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   After The Associated Press first disclosed special assignments
in the Trie and Hubbell cases last year, Johnson wrote a letter
saying her decision was not politically motivated and simply was
designed to shift complex cases to judges with open schedules.
</P>
<P>
   She has repeatedly declined requests for additional comment.
</P>
<P>
   The legal sources at the federal courthouse in Washington say
the five judges overseeing the probe will work with Whitley to
complete the investigation swiftly, perhaps in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the findings of Whitley and the five judges, the panel
will make a recommendation to the Judicial Council of federal
appeals and district judges, who must decide whether to discipline
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The council's decision could be appealed to the Judicial
Conference, the policymaking body for the U.S. court system.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the hiring of outside counsel to investigate
a judge's conduct is relatively rare.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't think of any parallel situation in which it became
known that an outside investigator has been hired,'' said New York
University law professor Stephen Gillers. ''Usually it's all done
internally.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitley declined comment through a secretary at the Atlanta law
firm where he works.
</P>
<P>
   He served as U.S. attorney in Macon, Ga., from 1981-87, then
moved to the Justice Department in Washington where in 1989, he
became acting associate attorney general, the department's No. 3
post. From 1990-93, Whitley served a second stint as U.S. attorney
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   According to courthouse sources, Whitley will interview Johnson
and others about why she bypassed a computer system that randomly
assigns criminal cases. Johnson's bypassing of the random system
disturbed some of her colleagues, and they have since discarded the
rarely used court rule that allowed the special assignments.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said it was unclear whether a separate matter --
closed meetings among Clinton-appointed judges at the courthouse --
also will be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch, a conservative legal group, has filed a formal
complaint against Johnson. The group released a letter from the
federal appeals court stating that the allegation of secret
meetings ''remains under advisement.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure also is mounting from Capitol Hill. Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind., has asked Johnson to testify May 17 before his House
Government Reform Committee. That committee still has not been told
whether Johnson will accept the panel's invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, an appointee of President Carter, assigned the tax
evasion case against Hubbell and the fund-raising prosecution of
Trie to judges recently appointed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   She also assigned four other fund-raising cases to Clinton
judges, including that of Howard Glicken, a former fund-raiser for
Vice President Al Gore. Glicken was sentenced to community service.
In that case, Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan wrote the judge
pleading for leniency.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the complaint against Johnson for the Trie and
Hubbell cases was dismissed by a federal appeals judge. But when
Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., disclosed the additional cases, the
Judicial Council named the five-judge panel to take a closer look.

<HEADLINE> Con Ed seeks settlement in Indian Point 2 leak  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GORMLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Consolidated Edison indicated Tuesday it
wants to discuss a settlement over whether it should pass through
extra costs to ratepayers created by an outage at its Indian Point
2 nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Point was knocked off line on Feb. 15, and both the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Pataki administration have
indicated the utility should have taken more precautions or
predicted the outage. A minute amount of radioactive steam was
released when the plant went out.
</P>
<P>
   A group of state legislators have filed a ''prudency'' petition
with the state Public Service Commission seeking to block Con Ed
from passing through the outage costs to ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The company has just today begun discussions with the Public
Service Commission seeking a positive resolution on the issue of
pass-along costs,'' said Con Ed spokesman Joseph Petta. He said it
would be inappropriate for Con Ed to say more at this early stage
of talks.
</P>
<P>
   State Administrative Law Judge Jeffrey Stockholm on Tuesday set
Oct. 16 as the tentative deadline for Con Ed to show that its
actions leading to the radioactive leak were prudent.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Richard Brodsky of Westchester County fought a
request by Con Ed on Tuesday to delay the discovery process while
settlement negotiations begin. The hearing judge rejected Con Ed's
request.
</P>
<P>
   Now Brodsky and other legislators can force the utility to
release internal documents on the maintenance and condition of
generators at the Indian Point 2 plant.
</P>
<P>
   Brodsky, whose district is part of Con Ed's service area, said
full disclosure is needed to make sure ratepayers are protected and
compensated fully.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want the truth to come out and the money to follow the
truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan Assemblyman Adriano Espaillat said Con Ed ''must put
public safety over profits.'' Last summer, hundreds of thousands of
Con Edison customers in New York City and Westchester County lost
electricity during a heat wave. Service was lost July 6 for 18
hours in Espaillat's district of Washington Heights and upper
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed was asked in Tuesday's PSC meeting whether it would
suspend the collection of $600,000 a day from ratepayers to buy
electricity to replace that generated by Indian Point 2, which
remains off line. It refused, Brodsky said. The payments come from
$3-a-month charges to customers.
</P>
<P>
   An official at Con Ed didn't immediately return a request for
comment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court on Tuesday
overturned the death sentence given to Terry Johnson, who killed a
state trooper in 1991, and ordered him imprisoned for life without
parole.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and his brother were convicted of killing Trooper
Russell Bagshaw early in the morning of June 5, 1991. Johnson fired
nearly 20 hollow-point bullets at Bagshaw's cruiser after the
trooper's routine patrol interrupted the robbery of a North Windham
sporting goods store.
</P>
<P>
   Terry and Duane Johnson were convicted of capital felony in
separate trials. Terry Johnson received a death sentence; Duane
Johnson was sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But the high court ruled that jurors erred when they found that
Terry Johnson had killed Bagshaw in an especially cruel or heinous
manner. That finding was based on the conclusion that Bagshaw had
been terrorized when he was ambushed.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that the shooting itself was not
enough to meet the standard for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vile nature of the crime committed by the defendant in
this case cannot be overstated,'' the high court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said the jury could not have found that Johnson
caused Bagshaw pain above and beyond what caused his death.
</P>
<P>
   Windham County Chief State's Attorney Mark Solak was out of his
office Tuesday, a secretary said. A message was also left seeking
comment from Chief State's Attorney John Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Gold, an assistant state public defender, said the court
''has drawn some sort of line that says every killing is not
necessarily cruel and heinous.''
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled unanimously against a number of other challenges
to Johnson's conviction and the trial judge's refusal to allow him
to withdraw a guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   But the court was divided 4-3 on reversing the death sentence,
with Chief Justice Francis McDonald and justices Barry Schaller and
Paul Foti dissenting.
</P>
<P>
   In arguments on the appeal in October, Johnson's attorney
Richard Emmanuel argued that Johnson wanted to kill, not torture,
the trooper.
</P>
<P>
   ''The capital offense is over -- 17 shots, less than 10
seconds,'' Emmanuel said. ''There was no intent by the defendant to
prolong the victim's suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant State's Attorney Marjorie Dauster argued that Johnson
watched and waited as Bagshaw pulled up to the sporting goods store
and then unleashed a fusillade on the trooper.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was gratuitous violence in the number of bullets that were
fired,'' Dauster said.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said that while Bagshaw's last words -- ''Oh, my
God'' -- and final act of turning on the cruiser's lights ''evoke
great sympathy,'' they do not demonstrate that Bagshaw suffered
extreme psychological pain.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Expected To Get Debt Relief  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Uganda is expected to become the first poor
country to qualify for millions of dollars in debt relief under a
newly enhanced program administered by the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   However, the East African nation must first clear a World Bank
hurdle before obtaining final approval to receive $50 million a
year in debt relief over the next 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's board of directors met Tuesday to decide whether
Uganda can benefit from the high-profile debt initiative. The IMF
board signed on to the deal Monday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and leaders of other rich nations have been
promoting the debt relief program for 40 of the world's poorest
nations since their annual economic summit last June. But critics,
including Pope John Paul II and aid agencies, say the program is
slow and doesn't provide enough relief.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda was supposed to reach what lenders call the ''completion
point'' last month during the spring meetings of the two
Washington-based international financial institutions. But some IMF
nations raised strong objections to Uganda's decision to spend $36
million on a jet aircraft for President Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan officials said the decision to buy the secondhand jet
had been agreed on by the country's parliament and was a
justifiable expense. There was no suggestion that any money freed
up under the Highly Indebted Poor Countries debt initiative would
be involved in the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The East African nation has always been regarded as a model
country in the HIPC debt relief process. It used $37 million saved
in a previous program to increase school enrollment. Uganda now is
expected to receive $50 million under what the IMF and World Bank
call the enhanced HIPC program.
</P>
<P>
   The executive boards of both organizations, whose approval is
required for debt relief, deferred their decisions on Uganda last
month, at a time when thousands of demonstrators were gathering in
Washington. Among their demands, the protesters wanted the IMF and
World Bank to stop treating poor countries harshly and ease or
totally cancel their debt burdens.
</P>
<P>
   IMF approval of debt relief for Uganda came Monday as Stanley
Fischer was winding up his 11-week reign as the IMF's managing
director.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Horst Koehler, former president of the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, assumed the top job Tuesday
after a bitter succession race in which Fischer was one of the
leading candidates to run the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs, a persistent critic of the IMF,
said Koehler must end the ''excruciatingly slow debt relief
process.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope he will provide the leadership to get this job done
now,'' Sachs said. ''He should recognize the current process is not
working and call for faster action.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and World Bank have promised ''deeper, faster, broader''
debt relief for 40 of the world's poorest nations. So far only five
have qualified since the program began in 1996. The IMF and World
Bank said at the meetings last month they hope to boost that number
to 20 by the end of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Parent Discrimination Banned  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parenting teens is just as important as
holding down a government job, President Clinton said Tuesday in
signing an executive order prohibiting discrimination against
parents in the federal workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Believe it or not, there are still some employers who are
reluctant to hire or to promote employees who have children at
home,'' Clinton said at a White House conference on raising and
mentoring responsible teens.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal of this order simply says no glass ceiling for
parents,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The order ensures that workers are not discriminated against
simply because they are parents. It applies only to federal workers
and does not require approval from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''The job they're doing at home is more important anyway, and if
they can do your job, you ought not to stop them,'' Clinton said to
employers of parents.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, teens, teachers, youth workers and others attended the
daylong conference, which was moderated by first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton. Topics included what parents and communities can do
to help teens succeed, how parents can spend more time with their
teens, and the media's effect on youth and parenting.
</P>
<P>
   Today's teens aren't different, society is, Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather than trying to make our kids somehow adapt, we should
be thinking about ways that our institutions can change and be more
supportive of our own kids and provide what our children have
always needed -- the kind of connectedness and support and love and
discipline that every young person really wants and needs from
us.''
</P>
<P>
   She announced an Internet site for teen-agers
(http://www.americasteens.gov) to help them with homework, hobbies
and careers. The site is being developed by 17 federal agencies. In
addition, she announced that another site will be created where
parents can find information about current media ratings systems.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee spokesman Chris Paulitz complained
that the conference relied heavily on liberal-minded panelists.
Mrs. Clinton ''used to say it takes a village to raise a child,''
Paulitz said. ''Now all it takes is partisan Democrats and
Hollywood moguls.''
</P>
<P>
   Actor and producer Danny DeVito, father of two teens and a
12-year-old, and his wife, actress Rhea Perlman, spoke in the East
Room of the White House about successful after school initiatives
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to listen to kids,'' DeVito said. ''There are so many
things going through their heads. They're confused. They're mad, or
sad. What do they do if they don't have anybody who they can trust
or turn to?''
</P>
<P>
   But just being at home doesn't mean parents are emotionally
involved with their teens, said Dr. Robert Blum, director of
general pediatrics and adolescent health at the University of
Minnesota. Going shopping or tossing a football does not bond
parents and teens, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I challenge adults to include us, encourage us, have faith in
youth of all ages,'' said Gabriella Contreras, a 14-year-old
activist in Tuscon, Ariz. ''Volunteer with us to make a difference
in our community, to enable us to have a voice ... or just get
involved with our daily lives.''

<HEADLINE> In A.C., Trump World's Fair still in trouble, even after closing  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Snakebitten almost from the day it
opened, a Boardwalk casino is still causing problems -- seven months
after closing its doors for good.
</P>
<P>
   Falling glass panes from part of Trump World's Fair forced the
closing of a two-block stretch of the Boardwalk on Sunday and
Monday, angering nearby merchants. It was reopened Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The city, meanwhile, is still struggling to cope with the
closing of the casino in October. The reduction of the property's
assessment -- from $220 million when it was open to $67 million now
-- plunged the city's budget into chaos, prompting plans for a tax
increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe in bad luck, but if any building has it, it's
this one,'' said Michael Pollock, editor of a gaming industry
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Built as a Playboy casino by Hugh Hefner, the 21-story
steel-and-glass tower was the first casino to be built from scratch
after casinos were legalized here.
</P>
<P>
   It had an inauspicious debut: Gawkers came to look at the
cocktail servers in their sexy Playboy bunny outfits, crowding out
gamblers. A year later, casino regulators denied Hefner a license,
forcing him to sell out to partner Elsinore Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As the Atlantis, the casino had another dubious first -- the
first New Jersey casino to file for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Trump's luck was no better. After buying the building for
$63 million in 1989, he operated it only as a hotel until 1996,
when he pumped $48 million into it and opened it as an addition to
Trump Plaza Hotel &AMP; Casino.
</P>
<P>
   But the layout of the awkward, three-tiered casino didn't work
well for him, either. By the time Trump World's Fair closed in
October, it was losing more than $10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only good thing that can happen now is to knock the whole
thing down,'' said city construction inspector Steve Frame.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what's happening. But what can go wrong will go
wrong. It already has.
</P>
<P>
   A demolition company is tearing down the casino's six-story bus
depot and ballroom annex and will, before year's end, knock down
the 21-story tower, too.
</P>
<P>
   Work crews preparing the building for demolition broke through
its interior walls and broke the exterior glass panels. That, in
turn, allowed wind inside the building, which has blown out panels
-- raining glass on the Boardwalk below -- at least four times.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Golas, owner of Food Court Express, a Boardwalk food outlet
located next door to Trump World's Fair, said the closing of the
Boardwalk has cost him thousands of dollars in business.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to enter his restaurant is from the Boardwalk, and
when it's closed, so is he.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I do three or four more weekends like this, I won't be able
to stay in business,'' Golas said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, American Souvenirs manager Yaqub Abro, said his
business was suffering, too. ''We can't have $100 days and stay
open. It's not our fault but we're the ones in trouble because of
it,'' he said of the falling glass.
</P>
<P>
   They worry about the fallout once demolition begins on the
World's Fair tower. ''If they have trouble with this building, how
are they going to get the big one down?'' said Golas.
</P>
<P>
   The city is currently trying to decide whether to cite the
demolition contractor, which it has ordered to stop work several
times, Frame said.
</P>
<P>
   Trump spokeswoman Kim Butler declined comment on the building's
latest problems.
</P>
<P>
   Trump plans to build a new $750 million casino on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be happy when the land is put back to its highest and
best use,'' said city Business Administrator Andrew Mair. ''If
Trump comes through with his plans, it'll be a great thing for the
town.''

   Time Warner Cable Restoring ABC
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner agreed today to return ABC to its
cable systems, at least temporarily bringing ''Good Morning
America'' and ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' back to the 3.5
million customers who had the channel blacked out because of a
corporate dispute. The cable company agreed, in effect, to an
extension to keep negotiating with the Walt Disney Co., ABC's
corporate parent, until July 15. On the cable company's Manhattan
system, an ABC network soap opera quickly returned to channel 7.
ABC issued a statement saying it was ''gratified that Time Warner
is now making the viewers their first priority.''

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell broadly today after AT&AMP;T delivered a
cautious profit outlook and investors took profits from a three-day
rally in technology shares. Worries about rising interest rates
hung over the market, keeping volume low and buyers scarce. The Dow
Jones industrial average fell 80.66 to close at 10,731.12. Broader
stock indicators also fell, with the Nasdaq Composite Index falling
172.61 to 3,785.47, its first decline in four sessions. AT&AMP;T fell
after lowering its earnings forecasts for fiscal year 2000, saying
the competitive long-distance market is cutting into consumer phone
revenue. AT&AMP;T said it now expects to produce full-year operating
profits of between $1.80 and $1.85 per share rather than the
previous estimate of $1.89 to $1.94.

   AT&AMP;T Posts Gain, Issues Warning
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T's stock plunged today as the nation's
largest provider of long distance and cable TV services met most
expectations with a small gain in first-quarter operating profits,
but warned of slower growth for the year. The company earned $1.73
billion or 53 cents per share in the first three months of 2000,
excluding one-time factors and the certain ownership interests that
gave AT&AMP;T net income of $1.74 billion or 54 cents per share for the
quarter. But AT&AMP;T cautioned that it now expects to produce
full-year operating profits of between $1.80 and $1.85 per share
rather than the previous estimate of $1.89 to $1.94. Today shares
of AT&AMP;T were at 42\, down 6}.

   Economic Indicators, Home Sales Up
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. economy is set to grow well into the
second half of the year, according to private reports released
today, while the government provided fresh evidence in a third
report that rising interest rates have done little to dissuade
new-home buyers. The Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which is
designed to predict economic activity three to six months ahead,
rose 0.1 percent in March. A separate forecast from the National
Association of Purchasing Management said the manufacturing
industry will continue to prosper through the year, and companies
are looking for a 5.9 percent increase in revenues over last year.
Many analysts were expecting new-home sales to fall by roughly 2
percent. The 4.5 percent gain posted in March was the biggest leap
since a 6.8 percent increase in October.

   Microsoft Defense Seeks Gov't Files
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft plans to ask for authority to seek
government records and subpoena witnesses to support its argument
that breaking the company in two would be going too far, a company
spokesman said today. Jim Cullinan said he expects a long discovery
process to find out how the Justice Department came up with its
''Draconian and overbearing'' proposal. The company is scheduled to
file its response to the agency's proposed remedy in the antitrust
case with U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson on May 10.
The judge is not bound to accept Microsoft's request. He has said
he wants to complete the remedy phase quickly. Microsoft made a
similar request for months of delay to prepare for the opening of
the trial two years ago, and Jackson rejected it.

   Europe Exchanges Close to Merger
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The London and Frankfurt stock exchanges are set
to announce as early as Wednesday a plan to merge in a bid to
create a European counterweight to Wall Street, sources close to
the talks said. The move would mark a major step toward creating a
global market for the most affordable trading of stocks. At least
one major U.S. financial player -- the Nasdaq Stock Market -- will
hold an unspecified stake in the new Anglo-German exchange, said
the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The London Stock
Exchange and Germany's Deutsche Boerse will hold equal shares in
the combined entity. The Deutsche Boerse approved the deal on
Friday, and the London exchange planned to approve the merger, the
sources said. New pressure on Europe's stock exchanges to
consolidate followed the introduction a single European currency,
the euro, together with competition from U.S. markets and
electronic trading.

   Uganda Expected To Get Debt Relief
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Uganda is expected to become the first poor
country to qualify for millions of dollars in debt relief under a
newly enhanced program administered by the World Bank and
International Monetary. However, the East African nation must first
clear a World Bank hurdle before obtaining final approval to
receive $50 million a year in debt relief over the next 26 years.
The bank's board of directors met today to decide whether Uganda
can benefit from the high-profile debt initiative. The IMF board
signed on to the deal yesterday.

Airport. ''We are still operating charters and military flights but
not passenger flights,'' Pam Buoninconcri, director of corporate
relations for Tower, said today. ''We are not out of business. We
are still operating.'' Asked whether passenger flights would resume
at some point, Buoninconcri said, ''I can't predict the future.''

   LONDON (AP) -- The head of a consortium seeking to take over
Rover's struggling car business in a last-ditch effort to save
thousands of jobs said talks today with Germany's BMW about a
buyout were ''extremely positive.'' Members of the so-called
Phoenix consortium met with BMW executives in their first round of

<HEADLINE> Contract-less guards go public with video  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GORMLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The union representing corrections officers
who guard the state's 70,000 worst felons is going over the
governor's head to plead its case to the public about how tough its
members' jobs are.
</P>
<P>
   The union-produced video is ''Inside the Walls: The Toughest
Beat in New York State Law Enforcement.'' The public relations tool
was shown to state senators Tuesday before it makes the rounds of
civic groups and community service clubs statewide.
</P>
<P>
   It uses stark black-and-white footage inside prisons to show the
fear, threats and abuse to which officers are subjected daily. The
echoing clank of steel locks on steel doors punctuates the brief
glimpse inside state prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The union representing the state's more than 24,000 corrections
officers has been working without a contract since April 1, 1999.
Their base pay with uniform compensation and other benefits make
the starting pay at least $40,000, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Correctional Officers &AMP; Police Benevolent
Association wants to have certain concessions for its officers
which are routinely granted to police bargaining units in New York.
They include a 30-day limit on suspensions resulting from
allegations of wrongdoing lodged by inmates or others. The union is
also seeking continued health care and other benefits to family
members.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the best of times this is the most stressful job in state
government,'' said Sen. Michael Nozzolio, chairman of the Senate's
crime victims, crime and corrections committee. His Auburn-based
district in the Finger Lakes district has five prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governor has said repeatedly that he has the utmost
respect for the job these people do and it's one of the toughest in
state government,'' said Mary Hines, spokeswoman for the Office of
Employee Relations. Negotiations are in mediation and both sides
continue to talk, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The video includes interviews with men and women officers. They
relay stories of inmates accumulating arsenals of hand-hewn knives
fashioned from plexiglass that can't be detected by metal
detectors, razors, small bits of steel, even eyeglass frames. They
talk of fear when a half-dozen officers must supervise up to 700
prisoners. And they also spoke of the continued fear of
''dousing,'' despite a recent state law that has toughened
penalties for the throwing of excrement and urine at officers.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the officers said they have trouble relating too much
about their jobs because friends and relatives can only listen to
so much about the harsh life inside, if officers feel they can open
up at all.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator concluded of one officer: ''He's in prison.''

<HEADLINE> Tuesday's Commodity Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gasoline futures jumped 6 percent Tuesday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange amid concerns about dwindling supplies just
ahead of the summer driving season.
</P>
<P>
   The gasoline rally also pulled crude oil prices sharply higher.
In other markets, corn climbed to a 17-month high and copper rose
to a six-week high.
</P>
<P>
   Unleaded gas prices have been vulnerable for weeks to a decline
in stocks, with refiners operating at less than full capacity due
to the steep cost of crude oil. Investors and consumers alike are
fretting about the impact on summer gasoline prices, which already
shot up during the winter when oil prices were peaking.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said there was no significant news to ignite
Tuesday's explosive rally, in which gas for June delivery shot up
5.35 cents to 88.62 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The surge came just ahead of the weekly inventory report by the
American Petroleum Institute, which market-watchers expected to
show little change in U.S. gasoline supplies.
</P>
<P>
   After markets closed, API reported that gasoline stocks actually
rose by 1.94 million barrels last week, lending support to
analysts' claims that the rally was overdone.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Evans, senior energy analyst for IFR Pegasus in New York,
said the buying frenzy in the exchange's gasoline trading pit was
''like a school of piranhas when you drop in some meat.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a big technical move but it was also just a crazy,
overblown reaction,'' he said. ''Traders were just throwing caution
to the wind and bidding this market up aggressively without a whole
lot of regard for how much risk they were taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the latest increase, gasoline supplies remain tight in
the runup to the high-demand summer driving season in the United
States and elsewhere. But the Petroleum Institute report showed
that refiners are stepping up to the challenge, operating at 93.2
percent capacity last week, an increase of 1.5 percent over the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
   Crude supplies, meanwhile, took a steep drop last week of 7.89
million barrels over the previous week, the API report said. That
sent crude prices up sharply in electronic trading after hours.
</P>
<P>
   June crude rose $1.02 to $26.89 a barrel in regular-session
trading, while June heating oil rose 2.03 cents to 69.47 cents a
gallon and June natural gas rose .1 cent to $3.217 per 1,000 cubic
feet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, June Brent crude from the North Sea rose $1.19 to
$25.08 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   On the Comex division of the New York Merc, copper prices
increased after new single-family home sales in the United States
shot up an unexpected 4.5 percent in March -- an indicator of strong
demand for copper construction materials. It was the second-highest
level ever for new-home sales.
</P>
<P>
   July copper settled up 2.15 cents at 82.15 cents a pound after
reaching a high of 82.55 cents.
</P>
<P>
   A day after prices of all agricultural commodities soared, corn
pushed to new gains on the Chicago Board of Trade on rising
concerns about drought impact on crops this year. The latest
forecasts called for temperatures in the 80s in Midwestern growing
regions this week, without significant rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   July corn rose 2\ cents to $2.46\ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans also edged up briefly to a 17-month high for the second
straight day before falling. July soybeans settled 2\ cents lower
at $5.65{ a bushel.

<HEADLINE> AM-CT--Boy Witness, Conn Bjt,700  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- The trial of the first of two brothers
charged in the killing of an 8-year-old witness opened Tuesday with
chilling testimony from the man who found the boy's body.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Williams' voice cracked as he described what he found
when he went to check on his co-worker, Karen Clarke, when she did
not report for work on the morning of Jan. 8, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he sounded his car horn, then called Clarke's name
several times before entering the Bridgeport duplex she shared with
her son, 8-year-old Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr.
</P>
<P>
   After entering through the open front door, Williams said he
walked by grocery bags and a woman's purse on the floor as he made
his way toward the rear of the house. When Clarke still did not
answer his calls, he went to check upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started walking up the stairwell and I (saw) B.J. laying on
the ground, on the floor ... at the top of the stairwell,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he was about to check the boy's pulse when he was
startled by the sound of television static. He said he ran down the
stairs, outside to his car and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   When the paramedics arrived, he showed them where the boy was.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the paramedics shook his head 'no' to the police
officer'' after checking the boy's pulse, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler, 28, is charged with masterminding the murders of
B.J. and his mother to stop the boy from testifying against him in
the 1998 murder of Clarke's boyfriend, Rudolph Snead Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's brother, Adrian, charged with being the actual gunman,
is scheduled to stand trial once Russell's trial is completed. Both
brothers face the possibility of the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Williams grimaced slightly and looked away when he was asked to
look at three photographs of the crime scene. The jury was shown
two of the photos -- one showed a view of the boy's body at the top
of the stairs, while the other showed grocery bags by the front
door.
</P>
<P>
   Later, autopsy photographs of Clarke were passed among the
jurors, but Judge G. Sarsfield Ford did not allow prosecutors to
pass out autopsy photos of B.J.
</P>
<P>
   The judge noted that the jurors had already seen the photos as
they were held up by Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict
and that they would be able to see them again during deliberations.
The autopsy photos contrasted sharply with a photo the jurors saw
earlier in the day: a smiling little boy wearing a blue denim shirt
and a red tie.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Kanfer, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, said
B.J. was shot four times -- in the right arm, in the left arm, in
the back and in the head. Kanfer said Clarke had three gunshot
wounds -- two in the chest and one in the right arm -- which may have
been caused by either two or three bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the mother and son were killed the night of Jan.
7, 1999, as they returned home from grocery shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last about four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors plan to call up to 80 witnesses, including a woman
who claimed to be an eyewitness to the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Lee, who lived across the street from Clarke and her
son, originally told police that she heard the two brothers
planning the killings, then acted as a lookout for Adrian Peeler
and watched as he killed the mother and son.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee appeared to recant what she told police in a letter she
wrote to her lawyer in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that I have told them (police) is lies,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she wrote three separate letters to Bridgeport
police officers in which she apologized for her role in the
killings and said she was grateful that the Peelers didn't kill
her.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's lawyers say they will use Lee's letter to try to
discredit her with the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Lee pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and agreed to
testify against the brothers in exchange for a maximum sentence of
seven years. She is expected to testify against Russell Peeler next
week.

<HEADLINE> Inmates sue state Parole Board, claiming hearing backlog violateslaw  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- State prisoners on Tuesday filed a
class-action lawsuit against the New Jersey State Parole Board,
claiming its backlog of parole hearings violates state law and
federal due process protections.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates, whose numbers could reach over 1,000, asked U.S.
District Judge Joel A. Pisano to order the board to meet the
mandatory deadlines for providing reports and hearings as set by
the New Jersey Parole Act.
</P>
<P>
   A Philadelphia-based prison reform group, ''... And Justice For
All,'' filed the lawsuit on behalf of the inmates, claiming board
members ''appear to be acting in an arbitrary, capricious, abusive
and vindictive manner.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Parole Board has been promising compliance for over a year
with little results,'' said a lawyer for the group, Philip Stephen
Fuoco. ''They have been given every opportunity to do the right
thing. The Parole Board's repeated failure to meet their own
self-imposed dates for compliance shows the need for the federal
court to step in and defend the constitutional rights of the
class.''
</P>
<P>
   Group co-founder Elaine G. Selan said the lawsuit was inspired
by the four-year struggle of co-founder and inmate Atiba Kwesi to
obtain timely parole hearings. He became eligible for parole in
1995, and his individual lawsuit is now in settlement talks, Selan
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Kwesi, serving time at Riverfront State Prison
in Camden for armed robbery, said no state agency oversees the
Parole Board ''so it appears they can function with little or no
accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   A message seeking comment from the executive director of the
Parole Board, Robert Egles, was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   State prisons on Tuesday held 23,689 inmates, with about 7,000
other state prisoners housed in county jails and halfway houses,
according to the state Department of Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   The department could not immediately say how many of them were
eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   Of that number, Selan believes that at least 1,000 have been
held in prison for up to a year past their parole eligibility date
without having a report done or a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It got to such a point that the parole board was so behind
that they turned off their telephones'' last year, she said. ''They
wouldn't answer them. It would just ring and ring and ring.''
</P>
<P>
   After defense lawyers complained, the board installed an
automated answering system, Selan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Parole Act mandates that prisoners must be seen by the board
on or before their eligibility date, Selan said.
</P>
<P>
   That is violated in many cases, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Selan said many of those who appear before the
board are referred for an ''in-depth psychological evaluation,''
which she said should be requested by the board before the inmate
is up for parole.
</P>
<P>
   ''It can be another year until that evaluation is done and
(prisoners) get back in front of the board,'' Selan said.
</P>
<P>
   No hearings were immediately scheduled before Pisano, who sits
in Camden.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Aims To Save Radio Stations  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public interest groups kicked off a media
campaign Tuesday to defend a government plan authorizing hundreds
of low-power FM radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Full-page ads in The Washington Post and The New York Times
urged consumers to mail cut-out coupons to the White House and
Senate and House lawmakers. The ads accuse the broadcasting lobby
of trying ''to keep broadcasting in the hands of a few
corporations. Which means that all radio, once the most diverse and
local of mediums, sounds the same everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Media Access Project, a public interest law firm in
Washington and the Public Media Center, a nonprofit advocacy agency
in San Francisco, jointly funded the ads, which also are appearing
in papers on Capitol Hill and about a dozen regional dailies across
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are hoping for a substantial response,'' said Andrew Jay
Schwartzman president of the Media Access Project.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission this year ordered the
creation of hundreds of low power mini-radio stations to give local
community groups, churches and schools more access to the airwaves.
Last week, it announced the first window for accepting applications
for the stations.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan is facing opposition from the National Association
of Broadcasters and some lawmakers, who say low-power stations
would add unacceptable interference on already overcrowded radio
bands. Earlier this month, the House passed legislation scaling
back the government's plan. Legislation to reverse the commission's
action is moving in the Senate as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is purely and simply about preserving interference-free
radio for the listening public. That's why public broadcasters,
religious broadcasters, radio manufacturers, and radio reading
services for the blind have joined NAB in questioning the FCC's''
low-power plan, said NAB spokesman Dennis Wharton.
</P>
<P>
   National Public Radio had urged the FCC to take more time to
study the interference matter. NPR says that public radio stations
are particularly vulnerable to potential interference because of
its music programming -- jazz and classical -- which can range from
soft to loud passages and because public radio stations are more
tightly packed together.
</P>
<P>
   ''The haste with which the FCC is acting does not service the
public interest,'' said NPR president Kevin Klose.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a sign of broader problems, Al Gore's
political standing is not as strong as it should be in a handful of
states carried by Democrats since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters and pundits in Minnesota, Oregon, Washington state,
Iowa and Wisconsin -- all critical to a Democratic presidential
candidate's bid for the 270 state electoral votes needed for
victory -- say Gore is locked in a surprisingly close race with
Republican rival George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is obviously troubling for Gore. Those are states he
should have in his pocket right now,'' said Democratic consultant
Dane Strother.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts expect Gore to reverse his fortunes in these
Democratic bastions, but they said Bush's early strength suggests
he is doing a better job of appealing to independent-minded voters.
</P>
<P>
   Gore expressed confidence Tuesday that he'll eventually put the
Democratic states in his column. ''I was 20 points behind eight
months ago in those states,'' he said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president allowed himself to be sidetracked by the
Elian Gonzalez controversy and wasn't helped by recent reminders of
Clinton-Gore scandals. In some places, such as Oregon and
Washington state, local issues have hurt him, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shaky base right now,'' said Steve Schier, a political
scientist at Carleton College in Northfield, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   National polls give Bush a slight edge over Gore or show the
race a statistical dead heat. The campaign for all-important state
electoral votes also is close: Gore leads in 10 states with 146
electoral votes and Bush leads in 14 states with 144, according to
an analysis of polls.
</P>
<P>
   In the most hotly contested battleground, a band of swing states
from Missouri to New Jersey, polls show a tight race -- though Bush
has a 6-to-8 point lead in Ohio and Gore is considered just as
strong in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore's in great shape with both general election voters and
Democratic voters because he's in the right place on the issues,''
said spokesman Chris Lehane. ''It's Al Gore who's protecting Social
Security. It's Al Gore who would protect Medicare and Al Gore who
will put real investment into expanding health care and resources
into our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gore's message has yet to take hold on the friendliest of
turf, according to Democrats and independent analysts in the five
traditionally Democratic states, which have a total of 46 electoral
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Erlandson, chairman of the Democratic Farmer Labor Party in
Minnesota, said Bush has a natural advantage this early.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's much easier to appeal to independent-minded
people, people who don't pay much attention to politics, when
you're an unknown quantity,'' Erlandson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I certainly believe that a few months from now, when the polls
come out, that will be reversed. People will learn more about Al
Gore as an independent person, separate from the Clinton-Gore
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Kasey Kincaid, a Democratic activist from Des Moines, Iowa, said
Bush is benefiting from a monthlong spree of policy addresses
designed to court swing voters, particularly women. The Texan has
promised better schools, affordable health care, bipartisanship in
Washington and housing for low-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush really has been -- for those paying attention -- a lot more
prominent in the news in recent weeks,'' Kincaid said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president has kept a low profile after knocking Bill
Bradley from the Democratic race. And his most high-profile moment,
siding with Cuban-Americans on the Gonzalez case, didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has created a lot of publicity for himself with a position
that reinforces negative feelings people have about him -- that he
shifts with the wind, panders, is not trustworthy,'' Schier said.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to forge a centrist message of his own, Gore delivered a
me-too speech on education last week and called Tuesday for a
greater focus on drug rehabilitation for convicted felons.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, Democratic National Committee member Ken Opin said
Bush is being helped by the popularity of GOP Gov. Tommy Thompson.
The nation's 32 GOP governors are Bush's political base, a symbol
of the pragmatic, centrist governing philosophy he promises to
bring to Washington if elected.
</P>
<P>
   ''There may be some carry over from Thompson who is enormously
popular,'' Opin said. ''But that can only get Bush so far, at least
I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington and Oregon, pollster Tim Hibbitts said both states
are in play for Bush ''and that's not good news for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush has been able to portray himself, despite a brutal
primary, as a centrist Republican,'' Hibbitts said.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in the Northwest also tend to be independent-minded, and
may be open to throwing Democrats out of the White House ''just for
the sake of change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts in Washington state say Gore is being hurt by his
refusal to rule out breaching Snake River dams, an act that
Republicans argue would hurt the state's economy. And GOP
operatives suspect they can get some mileage out of the Justice
Department's antitrust lawsuit against Seattle-based Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the states, analysts said news of Clinton-Gore
scandals are bound to take a toll. While Bush pushed centrist
proposals, Justice Department lawyers interviewed Gore about his
1996 fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing that can beat Al Gore are Republican
investigations,'' Strother said. ''Let's not kid ourselves; they're
going to be tuning up this stuff all the way to November.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Farmworkers Invade Buildings  </HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Thousands of landless farmworkers
invaded government buildings in cities across the country on
Tuesday in a new wave of protests aimed at speeding up land reform.
</P>
<P>
   Although many occupations were peaceful, police in some cities
used tear gas and rubber bullets to break up demonstrations and
arrested hundreds of protesters. Protesters reported dozens of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The worst violence was in the southern state of Parana, where
riot troopers blocked a caravan of 34 buses carrying farmworkers to
the state capital of Curitiba.
</P>
<P>
   Local television showed police firing guns and tear gas at
protesters, who responded by throwing stones and sticks. More than
200 farmworkers were arrested and dozens were hurt, according to
the Landless Rural Workers Movement, known here as MST.
</P>
<P>
   In Rio, some 300 MST members invaded the headquarters of
Brazil's National Economic Development. They pledged to stay until
they are granted an audience with bank President Francisco Gros and
until the MST's national leadership is received by Brazilian
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, some 600 MST supporters briefly occupied the
Finance Ministry offices in Sao Paulo but were expelled by police.
Farmworkers also occupied the headquarters of the government-run
Agrarian Reform Institute in Brasilia, the capital, and broke into
the offices of Brazil's Internal Revenue Service in the midwestern
city of Cuiaba.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Pedro Malan said the government will not
negotiate until protesters leave the occupied buildings.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Brazil's Labor Day holiday, other landless groups
invaded idle farmland in dozens of areas in Brazil's poor
northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The root of the conflict is Brazil's unequal land distribution.
The richest 20 percent of the people own 90 percent of the land,
while many of the poor have none.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our demands are the same as always,'' MST spokesman Nilton
Viana said by telephone from Sao Paulo. ''Land reform is stalled.
We have 74,000 families camped in tents by roadsides around the
country, waiting for a piece of land.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso, who took office in 1995, says he has distributed more
land than all previous governments combined, but MST leaders say
it's not enough. ''Any government would have done more, because the
others did nothing,'' Viana said.

<HEADLINE> House Approves Hmong Citizen Bill  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved legislation Tuesday that
would make it easier for America's former Laotian allies during the
Vietnam War to become U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill waives the English-language requirement for Hmong and
Laotians who were recruited by the CIA in Laos for covert military
actions. Proponents say the Hmong, an ethnic group in Laos, have
found it difficult to learn English because their language did not
have a written form until recently.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Bruce Vento, who announced earlier this year that he had
lung cancer and would not seek a 13th term, said in an interview
after the vote that the bill he has been pushing for a decade was
very important to him.
</P>
<P>
	   ''Most of us like to conclude things that are concludable,''
said Vento, a Democrat from Minnesota, which is home to 60,000
Hmong. ''I'm pleased that the House responded today on an
overwhelming basis.''
</P>
<P>
	   The bill passed the House bill on a voice vote with no
objections.
</P>
<P>
	   Identical legislation is pending in the Senate, where it was
sponsored by Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., is among its co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
	   ''Learning to read in English has been the greatest obstacle for
the Lao-Hmong because written characters in the Hmong language have
only been introduced in recent years,'' Vento said on the House
floor.
</P>
<P>
	   ''In addition, their long participation and service to U.S.
forces in the Southeast Asian military conflict significantly
disrupted any chance most Lao-Hmong patriots may have had to learn
a written language.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the House Judiciary Committee chairman,
said the United States owed a debt to the Hmong.
</P>
<P>
	   ''Those Hmong veterans who survived the war faced severe
persecution for fighting with the U.S.,'' said Hyde, who helped
shepherd the bill to the House floor.
</P>
<P>
	   He recalled that Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura pushed for the
bill during a meeting in Washington earlier this year. The two
large men engaged in a playful arm wrestle for the cameras.
</P>
<P>
	   ''And I want to say that the fact that he let me win has nothing
to do with my support for this bill,'' Hyde quipped.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Smith, Washington director of the Lao Veterans of
America, which had pushed for the bill, called Vento an
inspiration.
</P>
<P>
	   ''When we heard that he had cancer, we were despondent as an
organization,'' Smith said. ''This was something we could not win
without his leadership.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the group was emboldened when Vento, from his hospital bed,
had his staff call Smith to tell him he would continue to press for
the bill.
</P>
<P>
	   ''He's really our hero,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Smith, there are roughly 70,000 Hmong and Lao
veterans in the United States, and about half are not citizens.
Most are permanent residents but are not eligible to vote or hold a
passport.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 172; Dow Ends Down 80  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell broadly Tuesday after AT&AMP;T delivered
a cautious profit outlook and investors took profits from a
three-day rally in technology shares. Worries about rising interest
rates hung over the market, keeping volume low and buyers scarce.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 172.63 to 3,785.45, its first
decline in four sessions. The Dow Jones industrial average fell
80.66 to close at 10,731.12.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market indicators also fell. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
fell 21.96 to 1,446.29.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T fell 7[ to 41~ after lowering its earnings forecasts for
fiscal year 2000, saying the competitive long-distance market is
cutting into consumer phone revenue. AT&AMP;T said it now expects to
produce full-year operating profits of between $1.80 and $1.85 per
share rather than the previous estimate of $1.89 to $1.94.
</P>
<P>
   For the first quarter, AT&AMP;T posted operating profit of $1.73
billion, or 53 cents per share, matching the estimates of analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AT&AMP;T's new Wireless Group fell 2{ to 32}.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were mixed after three days of solid gains as
investors took some profits. Microsoft gave back its Monday advance
and fell 3 9/16 to 69~.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's decline came after Mary Meeker, an influential
technology stock analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said she
believes the stock is fairly valued in the 60s. Meeker said in a
research note she believes the proposal to break the company in two
to satisfy antitrust concerns is an excessive punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Remember, we aren't at all opposed to disciplining Microsoft,
but we think a break up is simply too harsh,'' Meeker wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Several other prominent technology stocks rose. Broadcom rose 7}
to 182 and Qualcomm gained 3 15/16 to 113 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market was fairly quiet, hemmed in by a lack of news
on inflation. The Federal Reserve holds its next policymaking
meeting on May 16, and many investors expect the Fed to raise
interest rates by a quarter-percentage point. Recent signs of
booming economic growth have stimulated some concerns that the Fed
could raise rates by as much as a half-percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates are generally bad for stocks, so fears of
a sharper-than-expected increase are likely to hang over the market
until the Fed's next meeting, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people have gone to the sidelines to wait for the
employment data due out Friday,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market
analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ''There's no sense of doom, but
investors are definitely waiting for more data to gauge the
strength of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic surveys released Tuesday showed little evidence of a
slowdown to more sustainable levels. The Commerce Department said
new home sales rose in March to their second-highest level on
record, indicating that Americans are unfazed by rising mortgage
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Fed obviously has more work to do,'' said Michael Moran,
chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. Moran believes
that the odds of a half-percentage point boost to rates are
increasing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The expectations in the market have shifted to such a degree
that the Fed might appear timid if it moves only 25 basis points,''
Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Conference Board said its Index of Leading Economic
Indicators, which is designed to predict economic activity three to
six months ahead, rose 0.1 percent in March, indicating continued
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-7 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.22 billion shares, compared with
1.16 billion in the previous session. The Nasdaq, which recorded
one of its quietest sessions of the year, saw seven stocks fall for
every four that rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 13.58 to
505.35.	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.2 percent.
Germany's DAX index rose 1.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was up
0.7 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 2.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> House passes downtown development deal; governor signs bill intolaw  </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Adriaen's Landing is law.
</P>
<P>
   Governor John G. Rowland on Tuesday signed legislation to spend
$455 million of state money on Hartford's $771 million riverfront
development project, touting it as a catalyst for redevelopment
across the state.
</P>
<P>
   The plan includes a 700-room hotel, a convention center,
entertainment and retail space and nearly 400 housing units. Also
planned is a $90 million stadium in East Hartford for the
University of Connecticut. The development is expected to create
about 3,400 construction jobs and more than 1,100 permanent jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone will share in this dream,'' Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   The spending bill passed the House 117-34 Tuesday afternoon
following more than five hours of debate which included concerns
about attracting conventions to the city and securing corporate
sponsors. The Senate had passed the measure 30-6 at 3:37 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The project had been scheduled for a vote Friday, but a deal
collapsed when the AFL-CIO demanded language that guaranteeing the
right to organize workers at the planned hotel.
</P>
<P>
   After negotiations Monday, officials from the Hotel &AMP; Restaurant
Employees and Bartenders Union of the AFL-CIO dropped their binding
arbitration demands and settled for wording that will allow workers
to organize without interference from their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Workers would earn a ''standard wage'' -- the average pay of
similar jobs in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our cause has been right,'' AFL-CIO President John W. Olsen
said in a written statement Tuesday. ''We forced the dialogue to
shift from creating poverty-level jobs just to appease a developer
to creating family-supporting jobs that will make Hartford a
stronger community.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders said they were pleased with the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been a long, tedious, painful-- at times-- process, but
with good results,'' said Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin
Sullivan, D-West Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Mike Peters said he was pleased with the ''new type of
leadership'' that overcame differences to work for a common goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a love-in, I guess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the project say it will benefit the state as a
whole by encouraging redevelopment throughout Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must look at Hartford as part of the overall agenda,'' said
Rep. Lenny T. Winkler, R-Groton. ''It creates a critical mass for
projects down the road. The truth is, we've never had a project
passed in this state that's been so thoroughly thought out and
analyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan has changed drastically since first proposed two years
ago when it expected to revolve around a football stadium for the
New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots backed out of the deal last year, and their stadium
was replaced on the drawing board by a domed stadium for UConn's
football team.
</P>
<P>
   Plans changed again when United Technologies Corp. donated its
75-acre Rentschler Field in East Hartford for the UConn stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James A. Amann, D-Milford, criticized lawmakers for
''rushing'' the plan, saying the state should not move ahead with a
convention center before booking conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this particular time, I believe this project is flawed in
this area,'' said Amann. ''It's what I call Adriaen's crash
landing. It doesn't make sense. It's a felony in
irresponsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The $771 million project, which will be tax exempt for 15 years,
would be funded by $355 million in bonds and $100 million in
surplus funding authorized last year. Rep. Andrea L. Stillman,
D-Waterford, co-chairwoman of the bonding subcommittee, and Rowland
said $210 million in private financing has been secured.
</P>
<P>
   The Waterford Group, which has developed the Mohegan Sun casino
in Montville and operates other Connecticut hotels, is one of the
project's major private sponsors. Operators Len and Marc Wolman
have agreed to spend $20 million to build the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really need to move forward on each of the elements-- the
land acquisition needs to be accomplished, the cleanup needs to be
done and simultaneously the joint reach of the components along
with all the details, documentation associated with it, of the
financial commitments ... need to be but into place,'' said Len
Wolman.
</P>
<P>
   Construction should begin next summer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''From my perspective, the risk is too great,'' said Robert A.
Landino, D-Westbrook. ''I oppose the bill, but I hope that I am
wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Gore: Move Vieques Training Soon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Navy live-fire training should be moved from the
Puerto Rican island of Vieques as soon as possible, Vice President
Al Gore said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the expected Democratic presidential nominee,
expressed support for an agreement between President Clinton, the
Pentagon and Puerto Rican authorities to conduct limited training
pending the outcome of a yet-unscheduled referendum by the island's
9,400 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Gore declined, however, to say what should be done about
protesters who have been blocking the training ever since a bombing
accident killed a civilian worker last year.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have said a raid by U.S. marshals and FBI
agents to remove the protesters could happen this week.
</P>
<P>
   Other elements of the agreement include turning over some of the
two-thirds of federal land on Vieques to Puerto Ricans and a $40
million assistance package.

<HEADLINE> Memo on Gore, Clinton Emerges  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A memo by a former prosecutor says that Vice
President Al Gore may have given false statements to FBI agents and
that President Clinton should be investigated in connection with a
business executive's $1.5 million in donations to the Democratic
Party, lawmakers were told Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter described portions of ex-prosecutor Charles
LaBella's unreleased 1998 memo, which urges appointment of an
independent counsel to investigate Gore, Clinton and former deputy
White House chief of staff Harold Ickes, the president's
fund-raising coordinator for the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   The White House complained about Specter's tactics in disclosing
the memo's contents at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary
Committee's panel on administrative oversight and the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''To read a memo and then to ask questions using lines from the
memo when it's supposed to be confidential isn't the way I think
the United States Senate is supposed to work,'' White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno declined to appoint an independent
counsel to probe campaign fund-raising and Republicans have been
urging the Justice Department to release LaBella's memo ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Specter and his staff have read the memo and other Justice
Department documents on campaign fund-raising in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   According to Specter, R-Pa., the memo says ''The vice president
may have given false statements'' and that Gore's lack of
recollection about fund-raising is ''reminiscent'' of his ''lack of
recall of the Buddhist temple matter.'' Gore maintains he didn't
realize a 1996 event he attended at a Buddhist temple was a
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the LaBella memo are Gore's denials that he knew
some of the money he was raising in phone calls from the White
House was being placed in ''hard money'' accounts, which go to
candidates, as opposed to ''soft money,'' which goes toward general
party-building. LaBella's report cites 13 memos that Ickes sent
Gore referring to ''hard'' money. Gore says he never read the
memos.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella also said former White House chief of staff Leon Panetta
recalled that Gore was attentive in meetings where the subject was
discussed and that notes by Gore's chief of staff reflect
discussion of the matter at a meeting attended by the vice
president. Gore said he didn't pay close attention to the details
of fund-raising and took restroom breaks during meetings because he
drank so much iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   Specter disclosed that the LaBella document seeks an
investigation of the president and the head of Loral Corp. because
of $1.5 million in donations by the business executive to the
Democratic National Committee. Loral obtained a waiver from the
Clinton administration allowing the company to do satellite
business with China.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella said the question for investigators would be whether the
money, in such situations, was given in exchange for benefits.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella said he thinks his memo should remain confidential
because to release it would have a ''chilling effect'' on the
operations of U.S. attorney's offices around the country that rely
on vigorous internal debate to decide whether to bring
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   According to Specter, LaBella's memo also suggested Clinton
should be investigated because the president's campaign fund failed
to alert the Democratic Party that money-raiser Charlie Trie had
brought hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal donations to
the Clintons' legal defense fund. For months after the president
and first lady were told of Trie's questionable contributions to
the defense fund, the DNC continued to collect money raised by
Trie.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella said that Justice Department official Lee Radek called
LaBella's theory for investigating Clinton on the Trie matter
''ridiculous. He said it was silly.'' Radek is head of the Office
of Public Integrity, which handles corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella said his memo identified Ickes as warranting
investigation by an independent counsel on a number of fronts as
the ''coordinator of the Democratic National Committee'' in terms
of fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Ickes ''had cameo appearances in several investigations'' the
Justice Department was conducting, said LaBella, who did not give
details.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left with the Gore campaign and with Gore's attorney
were not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Novelist Penelope Fitzgerald Dies  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTIN GAZLAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Prize-winning author Penelope Fitzgerald, who
wrote a series of understated novels after embarking on a literary
career late in life, has died at age 83.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, whose first book was published when she was almost
60, died Friday in London two days after suffering a small stroke,
said her cousin, Oliver Knox.
</P>
<P>
   Among Fitzgerald's most heralded works was her latest, ''The
Blue Flower,'' a novel set in 18th-century Germany that tells the
story of a young artist, later to become the
poet-writer-philosopher Novalis, and his romance with a 12-year-old
girl.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, it was the surprise winner of the U.S. National Book
Critics Circle prize, defeating works by such heavily favored
writers as Don DeLillo and Philip Roth.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald won Britain's prestigious Booker Prize in 1979 for
''Offshore,'' a quasi-autobiographical novel about life on an old
wooden barge moored on London's River Thames.
</P>
<P>
   ''We lived there because it was cheap, but not because it was
safe,'' she once said.
</P>
<P>
   She was born Dec. 17, 1916, to a literary and academic family.
In 1953, she was married to Desmond Fitzgerald, and she waited to
begin writing until after their son and two daughters were grown.
</P>
<P>
   Her novels incorporated elements of her unconventional life. Her
first published work, a 1975 biography of Victorian painter and
designer Edward Burne-Jones, was inspired by a childhood memory of
his windows at Birmingham Cathedral, where her grandfather was
bishop -- a memory she called ''my first idea of something
beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, she turned to the past for her settings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I go back to times when prohibitions and social pressures were
stronger so as to concentrate on difficulties which I profoundly
believe have not gone away,'' she wrote in an autobiographical
sketch for the U.S.-based H.W. Wilson Co.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, The Guardian praised Fitzgerald's skill at
characterization and the subtle, precise effect of her prose.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her style of writing is deceptively calm: the tone is quiet,
resigned to the foolishness of people, amused but not censorious,''
the newspaper said. ''You recognize immediately someone with a
delicious sense of words and natural ease in handling them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her late start in her literary career, she published
three biographies and nine novels.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard my novels described as 'light,' but I mean them very
seriously,'' she wrote in the sketch. ''If ever I see somebody
reading one of my paperbacks on a bus or in the Underground I have
to restrain myself from sitting down next to them and asking them
whether they see the world as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald's husband died in 1976. She is survived by their
three children.
</P>
<P>
   Information on funeral services was not immediately available.

<HEADLINE> 8 Injured Rocket Attack on Baghdad  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Six rockets slammed into a residential
quarter of Baghdad and wounded eight civilians, the official Iraqi
News Agency said Tuesday, blaming the attack on Iranian agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday night attack in Iraq coincided occurred around the
same time as a mortar attack on police headquarters in Tehran,
Iran. The Iraqi-based rebel group, Mujahedeen Khalq, claimed
responsibility for the Tehran attack that wounded six people.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq and Iran fought an eight-year war that ended with a
U.N.-brokered cease-fire in 1988. The two Muslim neighbors never
signed a peace treaty and their relations since the end of the war
have remained tense. Each harbors dissident groups fighting the
other's government.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi agency said the attack on Baghdad's eastern Baladiyat
district was carried out by a ''stray group of hirelings connected
to the organs of the Iranian regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq holds ''the Iranian authorities responsible for this
criminal operation and reserves the right to revenge at the
appropriate time,'' the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in less than two months that Iraq has
blamed Iran for an attack in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   In Tehran on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Iranian Foreign
Ministry declined to respond to the Iraqi remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The headquarters of Iraq's General Directorate of Security is in
Baladiyat, but it was not disclosed if the rockets hit it or any
other government building in the district.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials took foreign journalists on a tour of an
apartment building in Baladiyat close to the security headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said they heard at least three explosions at 11:30
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   One rocket gouged a big hole in an apartment on the third floor
where five members of an extended Palestinian familhopes it would make
them drowsy, then injected Justin with the drug. She was unaware,
however, that it must be diluted and fed intravenously into the
body, or else it burns the skin and veins without reaching the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   When Justin began crying, Riggs told police, she injected him
with some leftover morphine she had used on a hospital patient and
then smothered the boy and his little sister. Riggs then took 28
antidepressant tablets, intending to commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The children were found dead in Riggs' bed by her mother, Carol
Thomas, and Riggs was found on the floor nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs pleaded with jurors in 1998 to give her the death
sentence, saying: ''I want to die. I want to be with my babies. I
want you to give me the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   After her conviction, she pursued appeals at her family's
request but withdrew them this year after a judge ruled that she
could. The Arkansas Supreme Court later upheld her request.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney, John Wesley Hall Jr., said he wanted to fight for
Riggs' life, but went along with her decision out of respect to
her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I find it grossly distasteful to be involved in the death
machinery of this state, but as a defense lawyer, you have to do
this sometimes,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Riggs' mother and lawyer said she suffered
post-traumatic stress after working as a nurse in the aftermath of
the Oklahoma City bombing. The matter was soon dropped and never
came up at her trial.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs worked at the Veterans Administration hospital in Oklahoma
City from 1990 to July 1995, but the hospital says she was not one
of the employees who was sent to the bomb site. She later worked at
the Arkansas Heart Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors told jurors that Riggs' children had become an
inconvenience to her. They said she left the children by themselves
while she competed in karaoke contests and plotted their deaths for
two or three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hall contended during trial that Riggs was suffering from
depression and thought of their deaths as an act of love to prevent
them from living under the stigma of a mother who committed
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   A woman has never been executed under state authority, the
Arkansas Correction Department said, but Lavinia Burnett was hanged
in 1845 for being an accessory to murder. Counties handled
executions at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Just two other Arkansas death row inmates have chosen to drop
appeals and not ask the governor for clemency. Both have since been
executed.

<HEADLINE> Reporter hears man confess to arranging murder of rabbi's wife  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- She was a reporter. He was a private
investigator. They met Friday to discuss a sensational criminal
case -- the 1994 killing of a prominent Cherry Hill rabbi's wife.
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor joined them at a South Jersey diner, and by the end
of their meeting the man had confessed that he helped arrange the
killing -- at the rabbi's request.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sitting across the table from a man who said he had
something inside and he could no longer keep it a secret,''
Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Nancy Phillips said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips reported Jenoff's confessions in Tuesday's editions, a
day after Jenoff and an alleged accomplice were arrested and
charged in the killing of Carol Neulander, 52.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff is being held on $200,000 bail. Bail for the man he
allegedly hired, Paul Michael Daniels, is $400,000. Prosecutors say
both men confessed, saying they went to Mrs. Neulander's home on
the night of Nov. 1, 1994, with the intention to kill her.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, Rabbi Fred Neulander had been the only person
charged in the beating death of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, 57, once the head of the largest synagogue in the
southern New Jersey community of Cherry Hill, was long suspected in
the killing, but was not charged until September 1998. He resigned
his position three months after his wife's death after reports
surfaced about two extramarital affairs with members of his
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff, who had gone to Neulander for counseling after losing
his marriage and his home, maintains Neulander offered him $30,000
to kill a person he claimed was an enemy of Israel. According to
the story he offered reporter Phillips, Neulander told Jenoff he
could get him a job with Mossad, the Israeli secret service, if he
pulled off the murder without being caught.
</P>
<P>
   According to the account published in Tuesday's editions of the
Inquirer, Phillips and Jenoff met for an interview on Friday and
drove in Jenoff's minivan toward Philadelphia, but then he changed
his mind and drove into Camden, pulling up outside a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff then asked Phillips to call Camden County Prosecutor Lee
Solomon to see if he would agree to meet for coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon met Jenoff and Phillips at an Audubon diner. County
homicide investigator Martin Devlin accompanied Solomon. For three
hours, Jenoff sat across from Solomon and Devlin and, with Phillips
at the table, talked about his role in the murder of Carol
Neulander.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff ordered coffee and a fruit cup. As he talked, he smoked
cigarettes and drank several glasses of water. At times, he broke
down, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not a bad person,'' he said at one point. ''I just did a
bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff told Solomon that he hoped he could win leniency in
exchange for his cooperation. Solomon made no promises, but told
Jenoff his office would investigate and attempt to corroborate the
story.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was surreal,'' Phillips said Tuesday before Jenoff's first
court appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff's lawyer, Francis Hartman, said his client was haunted by
what happened and felt a compelling need to confess.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was something that was eating at him. The trial is coming
up and the thought occurred to him that the rabbi might be
acquitted and that might be a terrible thing,'' Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Neulander's attorneys, who have argued that Mrs. Neulander
was killed by an intruder during a robbery, charged that Jenoff is
a troubled character with questionable credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''In his belittled and befuddled mind, he's become a part of a
major story,'' said defense lawyer Dennis Wixted.
</P>
<P>
   Wixted also said the presence of the reporter at the Friday
meeting would be a complicating factor. Phillips' role makes her a
witness and her notes subject to a subpoena, Wixted said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's already under way, but I can't comment any further,''
Wixted said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Solomon thanked the media in general for
help, but refused to comment specifically on any role Phillips had
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone call made Tuesday afternoon to Phillips at the
Inquirer's South Jersey office in Cherry Hill was forwarded to John
V.R. Bull, assistant to the editor at the Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   Bull declined comment on the timing of the story or Phillips'
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything we have to say we will say in the paper, like we did
today,'' Bull said.

<HEADLINE> Tower Air Shuts Passenger Service  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tower Air, the no-frills airline that filed for
bankruptcy protection earlier this year, has halted all passenger
service, leaving ticketholders scrambling to find space on other
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are still operating charters and military flights but not
passenger flights,'' Pam Buoninconcri, director of corporate
relations for Tower, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger flights were discontinued Monday night. The airline
had been flying to Los Angeles; Miami; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Santo
Domingo, Dominican Republic and Tel Aviv, Israel. Flights to San
Francisco; Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Athens, Greece and Paris were
dropped as problems mounted in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Some 300 Tel Aviv-bound passengers learned of the news when they
arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport for their 11:30
p.m. Monday flight.
</P>
<P>
   Buoninconcri did not know how many other flights had been
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Morrison, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey, said Port Authority staffers at Kennedy were
helping the stranded passengers book flights on other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Tower Air Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
February in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   The same month, the airline, based at Kennedy Airport, said it
intended to cut 300 jobs, or 19 percent of its work force, and
reduce the size of its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Tower was known for low fares -- less than $400 round trip from
New York to Los Angeles, for example -- and spotty service. Delays
were routine, and Tower's fleet of aging Boeing 747s required
frequent maintenance.

<HEADLINE> Navy Defends Vieques Bomb Training  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon renewed it insistence Tuesday
that it has no alternative but to use the inhabited island of
Vieques for live-fire training. Critics said a federal showdown
with protesters is imminent because the Navy didn't look hard
enough for another target range.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today there's only one Vieques,'' said Rear Adm. Craig
Quigley, Pentagon spokesman, as federal authorities threatened to
forcibly remove protesters on the Puerto Rican island to clear the
way for an agreement allowing limited training.
</P>
<P>
   ''They haven't been able to use Vieques for more than a year,
and yet the Navy managed to conduct the training it needed,'' said
Manuel Mirabal, head of the National Puerto Rican Coalition, which
opposes military use of the island.
</P>
<P>
   Marbal said that since the United States is at peace and is not
threatened, it doesn't need the island as badly as the Navy says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Navy insists the requirements for the kind of
training it has staged on the Puerto Rican island since World War
II simply are not met anywhere else in the Atlantic. The island is
part of Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory, and its 9,400 residents are
American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Deep water, enough uninhabited land and free airspace are all
essential ingredients that make Vieques the best place in the
entire Atlantic, the Navy says, to conduct live bombing, shelling,
submarine maneuvers, amphibious assaults and ship-to-ship warfare
drills all at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, which controls two-thirds of the 51-square-mile
island, argues that it has been safely bombarding its test range
for nearly six decades -- halted only last year with the death of a
civilian worker in a bombing accident.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters have prevented implementation of an agreement
involving President Clinton, the Defense Department and Puerto
Rican authorities allowing scaled-back training on the island
pending a referendum by residents to decide future use. The
agreement also calls for turning back of some federal land to
Puerto Rico and a $40 million assistance package for the island.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley acknowledged that if Vieques residents vote down the
training, the Navy would be forced to develop an alternative,
although at ''considerable expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, critics continue to accuse the Navy of failing to
seriously consider alternate sites for live-fire training.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabal said the Pentagon showed the same resistance in the
1970s before it abandoned a weapons range on another Puerto Rican
island, Culebra, and another range similar to Vieques on the
Hawaiian island of Kahoolawe.
</P>
<P>
   He said Puerto Ricans are ill-equipped to argue with the U.S.
military about its assessment of needs, ''a business they are
solely in and keep secret.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said a year without Vieques ''does not seem to have
reduced their ability of defending the U.S. and carrying out their
obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has found alternatives to some of the training it does
on Vieques, diverting four series of naval maneuvers since the
temporary hold on use of Vieques last year.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it announced that the aircraft carrier USS George
Washington and its battle group would train off Virginia and North
Carolina rather than Puerto Rico
</P>
<P>
   The Washington and the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower battle groups
have both been diverted to the East Coast twice. Earlier this year,
three ships with the Eisenhower were sent to Cape Wrath, Scotland,
for practice shelling under an agreement with Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Lee Hamilton, member of the now-defunct Pentagon
task force that recommended the Navy phase out its use of Vieques,
said Tuesday he believes the military seriously tried to find an
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy examined ''in very great detail'' at least 18 possible
sites, he said. While opponents kept insisting there were bound to
be alternatives, they offered none, Hamilton said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Pentagon-appointed commission itself did not have
the resources to examine alternatives on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, he said, the military can make adjustments to
training, making Vieques unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not suggesting it would be easy, but I do think it can be
done,'' Hamilton said.

<HEADLINE> Web Site Scoops Up Stars &AMP; Stripes  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY BAIR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- An Internet company has acquired Stars &AMP;
Stripes veterans' newspaper, which has been published for all but
12 years since the Civil War, and will begin posting its stories on
a new Web site.
</P>
<P>
   IServed.com said Tuesday it bought the newspaper for an
undisclosed price and described the Stars &AMP; Stripes name as an
''amazing brand.'' The newspaper's stories will appear at
www.stripes.com and in a special mailed edition this week that
announces the change.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's deal does not include the government-owned European
and Pacific editions of the Stars &AMP; Stripes, which are circulated
at military bases. Those papers, which operate both on
subscriptions and government subsidies, previously agreed not to be
circulated in the United States as part of a deal that gives them
free rights to the Stars &AMP; Stripes name.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Haugerud, the owner of the U.S. edition, said he never
made money in the nine years he owned the paper, which mails 10,000
copies across the country every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have gotten a lot of psychic reward out of running the damn
thing,'' Haugerud said from the paper's office in Thurmont, Md. ''I
never tried to make money. The way we ran it, it was never going to
make money.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper has an editorial staff of only four people and
pays its free-lancers $50 per story, much lower than most national
publications.
</P>
<P>
   The paper publishes columns written by members of the U.S. House
and Senate and recently has run several articles and editorials
about military personnel refusing orders to take anthrax shots.
</P>
<P>
   IServed.com already publishes information about military
contracts, veterans and other matters on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars &AMP; Stripes was started for Union troops during the
Civil War in 1861. Soldiers from an Illinois unit under the command
of Gen. Ulysses S. Grant overtook the offices of the Bloomfield
Daily Herald of Missouri and used its equipment to publish a
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The paper stopped for 12 years after the war before it was
reborn as the National Tribune under the management of some of the
editors of the first Stars &AMP; Stripes. Its staff covered military
malaria outbreaks during the Spanish-American War, and the paper
was renamed the Stars &AMP; Stripes in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Haugerud, a real-estate developer, will join the board of
directors at the new owner. Rich Tauberman, a spokesman for the new
owners, said the mail edition will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will focus on developing innovative sponsorships and
commerce relationships that match the desire of marketers to reach
veterans with the needs of our members for relevant information and
services,'' said Jack Colletti, the new chief executive officer at
Stars &AMP; Stripes.
</P>
<P>
   The new corporate name will be Stars &AMP; Stripes Omnimedia Inc.

<HEADLINE> Confederate Flag Debaters Face Gap  </HEADLINE>
By JIM DAVENPORT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The dispute over the Confederate flag
flying over the Statehouse has exposed a generation gap in the
ranks of South Carolina's civil rights leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Some veterans of the struggles of the 1960s support a deal under
which the flag would be moved to a less conspicuous spot on the
Statehouse grounds. But a younger generation of blacks wants the
flag removed altogether and says the older leaders are too willing
to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flag has become a very emotional, symbolic issue,''
particularly for younger blacks, said Joseph Lowery, president
emeritus of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the civil
rights group once headed by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ''It
has taken the place of the back of the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Senate agreed April 13 to lower the flag as long as it
is raised again above a monument to Confederate war dead on the
Statehouse grounds. The House could vote as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   But many newer civil rights leaders and the NAACP say the
appropriate place for the flag is a museum. Proposals to move the
flag to a less-visible monument, include it in a circle of flags or
encase it in glass at a monument have all run into opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flag promotes the Confederacy's existence and white
supremacy,'' said Kevin Gray, 43, who heads the Read Street Freedom
House Project in Columbia. ''Placing the flag on the Statehouse
grounds is simply a slap in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray said the NAACP's tourism boycott of South Carolina, which
officially began Jan. 1, should continue until the flag is out of
sight.
</P>
<P>
   ''Older black legislators are tired of the fight or believe they
need to work in the spirit of comity and civility, that they need
to bend over backward for their white colleagues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Robert Ford, a black Democrat who grew up in the shadow
of Jim Crow laws, said it is unrealistic to think the flag would be
removed from the Statehouse entirely, because the state was the
birthplace of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   The ''whippersnappers don't know what's going on and don't
care,'' said Sen. Kay Patterson, 69, a black Democrat who has
fought to remove the Confederate flag from the Statehouse since he
was elected to the House in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Gilda Cobb-Hunter, a 48-year-old Democrat
who is among the most prominent in the new wave of black leaders in
the House, shrugs off Patterson's whippersnapper remark.
</P>
<P>
   Some black legislators' leadership style ''is go-along,
get-along, as opposed to some whose style is less of a willingness
to settle. That one word, settle, describes the difference,''
Cobb-Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lowery worries that younger lawmakers may be reaching for
the flag as a rallying point when they should be embracing more
important economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting for government contracts and opening job advancement
opportunities, ''is not as emotional and visible as the flag. It's
not glamorous like a lunch counter,'' Lowery said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent telephone poll showed 56 percent of South Carolinians
questioned favored the Senate plan, and support was as high as 60
percent among blacks. The poll by KRC Communications Research for
three TV stations was conducted April 28-30 and had a margin of
error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Similar divides have appeared in Alabama and Georgia, where the
Confederate symbol that is part of the state flag is generating
controversy again.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama Rep. Alvin Holmes of Montgomery was arrested 27 times
during civil rights fights, but he said that kind of in-your-face
activism is less necessary now that blacks have legislative power.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many young people don't understand the sacrifices made to get
them where they are today,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Rep. Tyrone Brooks of Atlanta, who joined King's staff
when he was in his early 20s, sees the difference between young and
old, militant and moderate, in a group of about 750 elected black
officials he leads.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to respect that young energy,'' Brooks said. ''You
have to respect those young ideas.''

<HEADLINE> Five Detained in McDonald's Bombing  </HEADLINE>
By PIERRE-ANTOINE SOUCHARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Five suspected Breton separatists were detained for
questioning by French police Tuesday in connection with last
month's fatal bombing of a McDonald's restaurant in Brittany,
police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the five included Gael Roblin, spokesman for
Emgann, a 200-member separatist group which is believed to be the
political arm of the Breton Revolutionary Army, known by its French
initials ARB. Two men and two women, whose identities were not
revealed, were also in police custody.
</P>
<P>
   The ARB, which seeks autonomy for the western region of
Brittany, is considered the prime suspect in the bombing, but it
has denied responsibility. Emgann, which means ''combat'' in the
Breton language, had previously condemned the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-terrorist authorities believe there may be links between
the Emgann and the ARB. But Emgann has denied links with the older
group, which has claimed responsibility for a number of nonfatal
bombings this year.
</P>
<P>
   The April 19 blast tore through the drive-through windows of a
McDonald's fast-food restaurant located near Dinan, a town of
22,000 people 250 miles west of Paris. A 27-year-old employee,
Laurence Turbec, was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups of Breton separatists have long sought autonomy for
the coastal region, which has maintained a strong cultural identity
reflecting the Bretons' Celtic origins.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have opened a judicial inquiry into the McDonald's
blast and into a bombing attempt in the nearby city of Rennes on
the same day. Police defused the Rennes bomb, which was placed in
front of a downtown post office.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the two incidents were linked. Explosives
found at both scenes are thought to be part of a large stock of
dynamite stolen in September from a company in the Breton town of
Plevin.
</P>
<P>
   After the theft, police recovered more than half the dynamite
and arrested eight Breton and five Basque separatists. Then, in
March, the ARB claimed responsibility for an attack that made use
of some of the explosives that weren't recovered.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to complete state swing; Giuliani picks upstate campaignexpert  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- As Hillary Rodham Clinton prepared for a
two-day foray that will end with her having visited all of New
York's 62 counties, Senate rival Rudolph Giuliani tapped a veteran
Republican operative Tuesday to bolster his upstate campaign
effort.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City mayor, who learned last week that he has
prostate cancer, has been criticized by some fellow Republicans for
not spending enough time in traditionally more conservative upstate
New York while the first lady has been crisscrossing what is
expected to be a major electoral battleground this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knows this state like the back of his hand,'' said Bruce
Teitelbaum, the mayor's campaign manager, as he announced that
state GOP executive director Brendan Quinn will become director of
statewide field operations for the Giuliani campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gov. George Pataki continued to duck questions about
whether he would take up the GOP Senate banner if the mayor drops
out of the race. ''I believe he will continue to run,'' Pataki
said. Beyond that, the governor said, ''I'm not going to
speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls have shown Pataki is the top choice among
Republican voters to take on Clinton if Giuliani drops out of the
race. The mayor said he will make his decision before the end of
May about that.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign aides were showing no signs of slowing down.
Joining Quinn at state GOP headquarters in Albany, Teitelbaum said
the announcement was the first in a series this week aimed at
letting people know the campaign was moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things on tap is a possible meeting later this week
between Giuliani and state Conservative Party Chairman Michael
Long. The two have been at odds over the mayor's refusal to come
out for a ban on what critics call ''late-term abortion'' and his
strong ties to the Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, with Long's encouragement, former U.S. Rep. Joseph
DioGuardi announced he would seek the nominations of the
Conservative, Right to Life and Independence parties. A DioGuardi
candidacy could drain conservative votes away from the mayor, a
liability in a close race. Polls show the race is close.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Long said that ''at this stage of the game'' he did
not see Giuliani being the Conservative Party's candidate and
believed the nomination would go to DioGuardi. But Long cautioned
that could change before the party's June 3 state convention.
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani said he would court the Conservative Party,
Clinton campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said the first lady would
ask the Liberal Party for its support despite the fact that party
boss Raymond Harding is one of Giuliani's top political advisers.
Both Giuliani and Clinton are scheduled to meet with the Liberal
Party's policy committee Saturday in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders of the Independence Party, the New York arm of the
national Reform Party, were grumbling Tuesday about state
Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope's reference to it as ''an
anti-Semitic party'' during a Monday night television appearance.
On Saturday, at an Independence Party forum in Buffalo, Clinton had
complained that one of the party's top leaders, Lenora Fulani, had
made anti-Semitic remarks in the past. Fulani, who was in the
audience, called the attack ''slanderous.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope spokesman Peter Kaufman said Tuesday that it was clear from
the entire interview that Hope was complaining about Fulani and the
Reform Party's possible presidential nominee, Pat Buchanan, not the
entire Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other states, New York allows major party candidates to
count the votes they receive on third-party ballot lines, a factor
in close races. In New York, no Republican has won statewide office
since 1974 without the Conservative Party line. Conversely, no
Democrat has been elected U.S. senator or governor without the
Liberal Party line since the party's founding in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to everything else, both campaigns were completing
work on new television ads that could begin airing as early as this
week. While Giuliani has already been airing TV ads, the Clinton
campaign has yet to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady planned to visit Washington, Franklin, Hamilton
and Clinton counties in northern New York on Wednesday and
Thursday, a trip that will mean she has visited all 62 of the
state's counties since she began campaigning 10 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hope noted that was not accomplished by Democratic Sen. Charles
Schumer until late last year, a full year after he defeated
Republican incumbent Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hillary Clinton is in the process of redefining New York state
politics, throwing traditional formulas out the window with her
relentless attention to counties that heretofore have been
ignored,'' the state Democratic Party leader said. ''Clearly,
upstate New York will be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hope said the first lady's visit to all 62 counties was
not aimed at helping her overcome charges that she is a
carpetbagger, the Giuliani camp pressed that point.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Clinton can travel to as many counties, as many times as
she wants,'' Teitelbaum said. ''It will not change the fact that
she's never lived in New York, never worked in New York and she has
absolutely no connection to New York. There's only one real New
Yorker in this race, Rudy Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton moved to the suburbs north of New York City in January.

<HEADLINE> Cops: Canada, US Gun-Smuggling Nixed  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A smuggling ring that transported vintage World
War II rifles from Canada to the United States in containers marked
''truck parts'' has been broken up, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the bust as the biggest of its kind in North America,
Canadian and U.S. officials said the smugglers operated in Toronto,
Montreal and Reno, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Police executing search warrants in both countries seized more
than 1,700 M1 Garand semiautomatic rifles, along with more than
20,000 M1 carriers -- the main component of the rifle -- and 39
banned high-capacity M1 magazines. Three machine guns also were
seized.
</P>
<P>
   Det. Sgt. Harvey Williams of Ontario's Provincial Weapons
Enforcement Unit said the firearms were vintage U.S. military
rifles from World War II and the Korean war.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law generally prohibits the import of military weaponry
previously sent out of the country, Williams said. The smuggling
ring was transporting the weapons back to the United States,
probably for collectors who pay $500 or more for an M1 Garand in
good working condition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Ira Mieteen, 38, of Toronto, and issued a
Canadian-wide arrest warrant for a second man, Melvin Bishop of
Reno, on charges of conspiring to knowingly export firearms without
authorization. Mieteen, who also was charged with gun trafficking
and other counts, has been released on bail, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. grand jury has been convened in Reno for Mieteen, Bishop
and another Reno resident, police said. The name of the third
suspect was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The charges followed a yearlong investigation of cross-border
gun smuggling that began when Canadian firearms regulators in New
Brunswick notified police of a large shipment of weapons. Police
discovered that some Toronto businesses were illegally shipping M1
carriers into the United States and marking them as ''truck
parts.''
</P>
<P>
   An operation involving U.S. and Canadian Customs services and
the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms intercepted one of
the illegal shipments in Atlanta, then linked it to a licensed gun
dealer in Reno, according to a police statement.
</P>
<P>
   Searches were conducted at Mel Bishop Enterprises in Toronto and
Reno, Century International Arms in Montreal and King Sol in
Toronto, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
spokeswoman Marti McKee confirmed that a Reno residence was
searched April 18 in connection with the case. She said no further
information was available.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were trying to determine where the weapons came
from, Williams said, noting that importing and possessing such
rifles was legal in Canada. It's different south of the border, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Govt. Cleanup Falls Short  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- There is ''reason to doubt'' the Energy
Department can clean up a uranium-enrichment plant in Kentucky on
schedule and get that work done within its budget, congressional
auditors said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative and
auditing arm of Congress, states that DOE estimates it will take
another 10 years and $1.3 billion to complete its efforts to
identify and remove toxic and radioactive contamination at the
Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. That is in addition to $400
million it already has spent.
</P>
<P>
   But the report says it will probably take much more time and
money to clean up the plant, where uranium used to be enriched by
the government for bombs and is now enriched by a private company
for nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   ''DOE faces many challenges to completing its cleanup as
planned,'' the report stated. It was released by Sen. Jim Bunning,
R-Ky., who ordered the audit.
</P>
<P>
   GAO reported that uncertainties about the extent, source and
nature of the contamination could affect the department's timeline
and cost estimates.
</P>
<P>
   GAO also noted that the plan relies on the assumption that
federal funding for the cleanup will increase to an average of $124
million annually through 2010. The report notes that figure is much
higher than the $43 million the department has received on average
over the past seven years. For fiscal 2001, the department has
requested $78 million.
</P>
<P>
   The report also states that the agency's overall plan falls
short of what actually needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even when the planned cleanup has been carried out, billions
of dollars and many years will be needed to address areas at the
Paducah site that are not in the cleanup plan,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   It said the plan does not address large amounts of waste and
scrap material, some of which poses a risk of an uncontrolled
nuclear reaction that could threaten worker safety. The report
states that such a reaction could produce a burst of radiation
lasting several hours, but it would be localized and would not
result in an explosion or release of radioactivity into the
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said DOE also has not included various unused buildings
and structures and thousands of tons of depleted uranium in its
cleanup plan. The report recommends that the project include all
materials that are potential health hazards to workers and the
public.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn L. Huntoon, DOE assistant secretary for environmental
management, said in a written response to the GAO that the report
does not account for ongoing work and improvements at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Huntoon also criticized the document for failing ''to offer
specific alternatives or recommendations regarding DOE's planning
assumptions and targets for completing work.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunning was critical of DOE. ''They're not realistic in their
approach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bunning added that he expects the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee to hold a hearing on the report, possibly as
soon as next week.

<HEADLINE> Judge to decide whether to approve multibillion-dollar settlement  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Opponents of a proposed $3.75 billion
national settlement of health claims against the diet drug
combination fen-phen called the deal inadequate Tuesday and intend
to ask a federal judge to throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plan is illegal and unfair,'' said Edward F. Blizzard, an
attorney for a splinter plaintiffs' group that objects to the
settlement. ''The amounts being offered to settle these claims are
inadequate to compensate people for their injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Louis C. Bechtle, who gave preliminary
approval to the deal last November, began hearing testimony Tuesday
into its fairness. The hearing is expected to last two weeks.
American Home Products, the drug's maker, and plaintiffs attorneys
favor approval.
</P>
<P>
   More than 9,000 lawsuits have been filed against Madison,
N.J.-based American Home, maker of fenfluramine, the ''fen'' in the
fen-phen combination. The company sold the drug under the brand
name of Pondimin and also made Redux, a chemical cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs were withdrawn in September 1997 after a Mayo Clinic
study linked the fen-phen combination to potentially fatal heart
valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, reached lasted October, pays fen-phen users a
maximum of $1.5 million. Most, however, would get far less,
depending on their level of injury and how long they took the
drugs. It also includes money for future medical monitoring for
those who are still healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Blizzard predicted the deal will be tossed out either by Bechtel
or on appeal. He argued the class is too large and involves too
many interests, from people who have suffered no ill effects from
the drug to those who have been seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Melbourne Mills Jr., an attorney in Lexington, Ky., who
represents 2,400 fen-phen users, said about 340 have dropped out of
the national settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the benefits for the most serious conditions are
adequate compared to what juries have awarded across the country,''
said Mills, who attended the court session.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody's trapped,'' countered Arnold Levin, a plaintiff
attorney who helped negotiate the deal. ''If they don't like it,
they can go out and try their own cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Of 6 million people who took fen-phen before it was pulled from
the market, just 45,000 of them elected to refuse the settlement.
Those who opted out retain the right to sue for punitive damages.
Those who remained in the class action may still reject the
settlement, but are forbidden from collecting punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see any room to object when you can walk away from the
deal,'' said Kip Petroff, a Dallas lawyer who won a $23.3 million
award in a fen-phen case last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's testimony, plaintiffs' attorney Michael Fishbein
described last year's settlement talks as extremely adversarial.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 75 or so negotiating sessions ''were what amounted
to screaming battles,'' Fishbein said. ''I cannot think of a more
adversarial negotiation.''

<HEADLINE> White House Drops E-mail Claim  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN SOLOMON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Tuesday dropped a potential
executive privilege claim and turned over to Congress several
handwritten notes from lawyers that were being sought by
investigators in the controversy over missing e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential counsel Beth Nolan made the concession in a letter
to Rep. Dan Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee, on the eve of a new round of hearings by the panel into
the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are making these seven documents available today to your
committee,'' Nolan wrote. ''We are not waiving the right to assert
executive privilege or attorney-client privilege with respect to
future requests.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue were handwritten notes by White House lawyers involving
discussions they had with computer experts about the missing e-mail
problem since the controversy first erupted earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The White House initially declined to turn over the memos,
saying they included the ''mental impressions'' of presidential
lawyers and may be protected by the president's right to keep
confidential the advice he receives.
</P>
<P>
   The White House did not formally invoke the executive privilege,
instead listing the documents and saying they were subject to such
a claim. Burton, R-Ind., criticized the maneuver as ''legal
mumbo-jumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressional committee as well as federal prosecutors are
investigating why the White House, after discovering a glitch in
1998 that kept e-mails from being properly archived, did not
immediately retrieve the missing messages to determine if they
should have been turned over to investigators under subpoenas
issued in investigations from Whitewater and impeachment to
political fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials blame a ''disconnect'' between their
technicians, who diagnosed the e-mail problem, and their lawyers,
who apparently did not understand until this year that the glitch
might affect pending subpoena requests.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan's letter Tuesday also made a second concession to the
House committee. The presidential lawyer turned over, without
requiring a new subpoena, a disk of e-mails from the Monica
Lewinsky investigation that White House officials used to test the
extent of the e-mail glitch back in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have said they retrieved a sample of
Lewinsky-related e-mails after the glitch was discovered and
determined they were duplicates of documents already turned over to
prosecutors. As a result, officials did not tell investigators
about the e-mail problem, review additional documents for
compliance with subpoenas or try to recover the rest of thousands
of missing e-mails until earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Robert Ray, the Justice Department and
Congress are all investigating whether the delay was part of an
effort to obstruct the investigations that have dogged the Clinton
White House. Presidential aides have denied such wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Executive privilege, which became famous a quarter-century ago
during the battle for Richard Nixon's audio tapes in the Watergate
scandal, refers to the right of a president to keep confidential
the advice he receives from aides on official matters.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Squatters Make Demands  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNA LOOF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Squatters occupying white-owned farms
have begun demanding transport, food and fuel from farmers, and
have even started advertising plots for sale, farmers'
representatives said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of war veterans -- who are reputedly leading the
occupations of more than 1,000 white-owned farms -- also marched
through Harare to the High Court, where their leader was on trial
for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Occupations and attacks on farm workers have persisted,
according to the Commercial Farmers Union, which represents most of
the country's white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Farm workers were attacked in Mashonaland East, east of Harare,
and nine were treated in the hospital, the union said. Their
conditions were unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A laborer who was abducted April 30 remained missing, the union
said.
</P>
<P>
   Squatters on one farm in Mashonaland East had marked off small
plots and offered them for sale, the union said.
</P>
<P>
   Several farmers reported they were forced to donate money to the
ruling party and to provide occupiers with vehicles, fuel and food.
</P>
<P>
   ''The demands ... are accompanied by threats, sometimes veiled,
of damage to property or violence. If the demands are not met, the
invaders are tending to help themselves anyway. An increasing
number of vehicles are being commandeered to transport people to
rallies or to the next invasion,'' the union said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   One farmer in Central Mashonaland, north of Harare, reported
that squatters told him it would be a waste to plant new crops
because the farm would be seized before the harvest, the union
said.
</P>
<P>
   Squatters have occupied 10 new farms in the past 24 hours, the
union said.
</P>
<P>
   In Londson, Commonwealth foreign ministers rebuked Zimbabwe on
Tuesday for failing to bring a peaceful end to the crisis, but
stopped short of any action, saying they wanted dialogue to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   In a strongly worded statement at the end of a day of talks,
foreign ministers from eight Commonwealth countries, including
Britain's Robin Cook, expressed ''deep concerns'' about the
''ongoing violence, loss of life, illegal occupations of property,
failure to uphold the rule of law and political intimidation in the
run-up to Zimbabwe's parliamentary elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Ministers urged President Robert Mugabe to create an environment
''in which fair elections, free of intimidation and within the time
schedule prescribed by the constitution of Zimbabwe, can be held.''
No date has been set for the ballot, which must take place by
August.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the occupations, Chenjerai Hunzvi, appeared in
court Tuesday on charges he forged medical reports to receive
benefits of more than $10,000. Hunzvi, leader of the National
Liberation War Veterans Association, is also a physician.
</P>
<P>
   Before Hunzvi's court appearance, hundreds of people marched to
the court singing revolutionary songs praising President Robert
Mugabe. Some carried a banner emblazoned with Mugabe's picture.
</P>
<P>
   The president has supported the occupations, which began in
February, as justified protest against the unfair distribution of
land in a country where 4,000 whites own one-third of the
productive farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's marchers closed off the street outside the court, but
allowed access to select people, including journalists. A judge who
arrived by car was chased away.
</P>
<P>
   Hunzvi also has been charged with defrauding two war veterans
groups of $70,000. In addition, a court found him in contempt for
failing to urge an end to the farm occupations. Sentencing in that
case, the result of a complaint filed by the farm union, has been
set for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''How do commercial farmers expect me to engage in serious
dialogue with them if these charges remain? They must drop the
charges immediately,'' Hunzvi told the independent newspaper The
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Hunzvi and the union have agreed that the squatters can stay on
farms, but that violence must stop and farm work must be allowed to
continue.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Approves Spending Bill  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House subcommittee quickly approved the
first spending bill of the coming fiscal year on Tuesday, but the
panel's easy passage belied budget fights between President Clinton
and Congress that lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   By voice vote, the House Appropriations Committee subcommittee
that oversees military construction approved an $8.6 billion
measure for fiscal 2001, which begins Oct. 1. The full committee
plans to consider the bill next week.
</P>
<P>
   There are 13 annual spending bills that keep federal agencies
functioning, and the military construction measure is traditionally
one of the least controversial. White House budget chief Jack Lew
signaled Tuesday that Clinton will demand more money for many of
the measures than Republicans seem ready to spend.
</P>
<P>
   Unless they do, ''the president simply cannot and will not sign
them,'' Lew said at a speech at the Urban Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Lew said Clinton wants about $20 billion more for schools, land
conservation and other domestic programs than Republicans seem
ready to provide, which is about $293 billion. The overall federal
budget is about $1.8 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is fundamental that the administration wants to spend more
and we want to hold the line. So they are going to characterize
anything we do as unreasonable cuts in that regard,'' House
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said later.
</P>
<P>
   The military construction measure finances facilities such as
bases and housing. It would provide nearly $300 million more than
this year's total, and $600 million more than Clinton requested.
</P>
<P>
   Included is $83 million of the $104 million Clinton requested to
build radar facilities in Alaska as part of a possible anti-missile
defense system the administration is considering. The subcommittee
said it might provide the additional money later.

<HEADLINE> High court overturns death sentence  </HEADLINE>
By STRAT DOUTHAT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court on Tuesday
overturned the death sentence given to Terry Johnson, who killed a
state trooper in 1991, and ordered him imprisoned for life without
parole.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and his brother were convicted of killing Trooper
Russell Bagshaw early in the morning of June 5, 1991. Johnson fired
nearly 20 hollow-point bullets at Bagshaw's cruiser after the
trooper's routine patrol interrupted the burglary of a North
Windham sporting goods store.
</P>
<P>
   Terry and Duane Johnson were convicted of capital felony in
separate trials. Terry Johnson received a death sentence; Duane
Johnson was sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   But the high court ruled that jurors erred when they found that
Terry Johnson had killed Bagshaw in an especially cruel or heinous
manner. That finding was based on the conclusion that Bagshaw had
been terrorized when he was ambushed.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled 4-3 that the shooting itself was not
enough to meet the standard for the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vile nature of the crime committed by the defendant in
this case cannot be overstated,'' the high court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said the jury could not have found that Johnson,
who was 21 when he killed Bagshaw, caused the trooper pain above
and beyond what caused his death.
</P>
<P>
   Bagshaw's widow, who has remarried, has moved and could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Windham County Chief State's Attorney Mark Solak said he was
disappointed with the ruling but glad that the high court found no
errors that would have meant retrying the case.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he regrets, as a citizen, that the death penalty
law will not apply in cases where police officers are gunned down
from a distance. He said he planned to ask the Legislature to make
it a death penalty crime to kill a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not have to ask juries to count the breaths of life
in a mortally wounded police officer,'' Solak said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland, who supports the death penalty, said the
ruling does not alter his stance on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still trust the system,'' he said. ''The judicial side will
make its determinations. ... We abide by its decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Gold, an assistant state public defender, said the court
''has drawn some sort of line that says every killing is not
necessarily cruel and heinous.''
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled unanimously against a number of other challenges
to Johnson's conviction and the trial judge's refusal to allow him
to withdraw a guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   But the court was divided 4-3 on reversing the death sentence,
with Chief Justice Francis McDonald and justices Barry Schaller and
Paul Foti dissenting.
</P>
<P>
   In arguments on the appeal in October, Johnson's attorney
Richard Emanuel argued that Johnson wanted to kill, not torture,
the trooper.
</P>
<P>
   ''The capital offense is over -- 17 shots, less than 10
seconds,'' Emanuel said. ''There was no intent by the defendant to
prolong the victim's suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant State's Attorney Marjorie Dauster argued that Johnson
watched and waited as Bagshaw pulled up to the sporting goods store
and then unleashed a fusillade on the trooper.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was gratuitous violence in the number of bullets that were
fired,'' Dauster said.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said that while Bagshaw's last words -- ''Oh, my
God'' -- and final act of turning on the cruiser's lights ''evoke
great sympathy,'' they do not demonstrate that Bagshaw suffered
extreme psychological pain.

<HEADLINE> Wiring Blamed in Texas Log Collapse  </HEADLINE>
By JUAN LOZANO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Texas A&AMP;M University students cut
corners in construction and school officials failed to adequately
supervise them before the bonfire collapse last fall that killed 12
students, an investigating panel reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Five people who were asked by the school to determine a cause
for the Nov. 18 accident cited organizational failures and
structural problems with the 59-foot pile of logs, which weighed
more than 2 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said student drinking and horseplay were not a
direct cause, but were among the problems that led to
organizational failure.
</P>
<P>
   The panel said safe bonfire construction was beyond the
capability of student leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important point is the fact that combination of
factors and not one factor led to collapse,'' said panel member
Hugh Robinson, chairman of a Dallas construction management
company.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Linbeck Jr., the Houston construction executive who headed
the panel, said a safe bonfire was possible if school officials had
taken precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck made no recommendation as to whether the 90-year
tradition be continued. But his comment that the bonfire could be
built safely brought whoops from the crowd of 1,500 students who
filed the A&AMP;M basketball arena to listen to the panel's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M President Ray Bowen praised the commission for what he
said was its thoroughness and precision, and added, ''There's
nothing I've heard that I disagree with.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would take about six weeks to decide whether to
continue the bonfire tradition. ''If I allow my heart to make the
decision, we would continue bonfire,'' he said. ''My heart will not
make the decision. My brain needs to make the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The bonfire event annually draws thousands of Aggies to the
College Station campus on the eve of A&AMP;M's football game against
its archrival, the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The structure is built over several weeks with stacks of logs
the size of telephone poles put in place by cranes, tractors and
student workers. The logs are wired together, and the structure --
which resembles a tiered wedding cake -- is designed to twist inward
and collapse on itself as it burns. The center pole consists of two
long telephone poles spliced together end to end and buried 15 feet
deep. It is held in place by guy wires.
</P>
<P>
   During the collapse, wires snapped and the entire structure gave
way. Twelve people working on the stack were killed; 27 others were
injured, some seriously. One student left the hospital just last
month, partially paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many A&AMP;M students and relatives of those who were killed
in the collapse have said they want the tradition to remain.
</P>
<P>
   The commission determined the structural failure was caused by
excessive stresses on the lowest of the four tiers. Those stresses
were heightened by excessive wedging of logs from the second stack
into gaps in the lowest stack.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest stack, however, had inadequate wiring to hold it
together. Steel cables used in recent years were not used in 1999,
the commission found.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also found the logs were standing too vertical, the
stack was overbuilt and the ground had a slight slope.
</P>
<P>
   Another member of the panel, El Paso real estate executive
Veronica Kastrin Callaghan, cited evidence of drinking,
irresponsible behavior and hazing by student leaders of the bonfire
project.
</P>
<P>
   Callaghan said students and school officials ignored a sharp
increase in injuries in recent years and overlooked previous
structural problems with the bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   The university should have ensured ''controls were in place so
if a failure occurred, results would be inconsequential,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The central message is clear,'' she added. ''The collapse was
about physical failures driven by organizational failures whose
origins span decades of administrations, faculty and students.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel also included the chairman of alternative energy
company and the former chairman of Texas Christian University.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a lot of relief that the investigation is
closed and we now know the truth behind it,'' said A&AMP;M freshman
Doug Keegan. ''Now we have an idea of the problems, and whether
they can be corrected.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't May Probe Air Tix Pricing  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Senate Democrats asked the Transportation
Department Tuesday to investigate ''unfairness'' in airline ticket
pricing, saying it takes too long to build an antitrust case
against predatory pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Enforcement actions under the department's statutory authority
are likely to be far quicker and simpler than the often protracted,
lengthy and complex antitrust enforcement litigation,'' Sens.
Herbert Kohl, D-Wis., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said in a letter to
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was released at a hearing of the Senate Judiciary
subcommittee on antitrust, business rights and competition Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department has never used the unfairness
standard before, although it is in its power to do so, spokesman
Bill Mosley said. He refused to respond directly to the letter,
saying the department had not officially received it yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department last year accused Dallas-based American
Airlines of undercutting fares to drive out tiny Vanguard Airlines.
American raised its fares once Vanguard withdrew, the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit was the first predatory-practices case brought since
airlines were deregulated in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Having the Transportation Department go for ''unfairness''
instead would help speed up things because there wouldn't be any
concern about meeting the technical requirements of antitrust law,
Leahy and Kohl said in their letter.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will give them a chance to get moving quickly, instead of
initiating an antitrust case which could take years,'' Kohl said
after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, start-up airline Sun Country Airlines, a
small carrier based in suburban Minneapolis which began scheduling
low-fare flights last summer to markets served by Northwest
Airlines, complained of bullying by Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Country's president, Bill La Macchia, testified that
Northwest excluded a big Minneapolis area travel agency from its
discount ticket promotions after the agency had sold more Sun
Country tickets than any other agency in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest also banned the courtesy practice of selling airline
parts to Sun Country, and discontinued arrangements in which Sun
Country paid Northwest to use its facilities for crew training, La
Macchia said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe it is Northwest's intent to drive us from the
market and achieve an even greater level of monopolization,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest has denied any uncompetitive, predatory or illegal
conduct.

<HEADLINE> Trial begins for man charged in witness slaying  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- The trial of the first of two brothers
charged in the killing of an 8-year-old witness opened Tuesday with
chilling testimony from the man who found the boy's body.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Williams' voice cracked as he described what he found
when he went to check on his co-worker, Karen Clarke, when she did
not report for work on the morning of Jan. 8, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he sounded his car horn, then called Clarke's name
several times before entering the Bridgeport duplex she shared with
her son, 8-year-old Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr.
</P>
<P>
   After entering through the open front door, Williams said he
walked by grocery bags and a woman's purse on the floor as he made
his way toward the rear of the house. When Clarke still did not
answer his calls, he went to check upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started walking up the stairwell and I (saw) B.J. laying on
the ground, on the floor ... at the top of the stairwell,''
Williams said. He said there was blood coming from the boy's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he was about to check the boy's pulse when he was
startled by the sound of television static. He said he ran down the
stairs, outside to his car and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   When the paramedics arrived, he showed them where the boy was.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the paramedics shook his head 'no' to the police
officer'' after checking the boy's pulse, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler, 28, is charged with masterminding the murders of
B.J. and his mother to stop the boy from testifying against him in
the 1998 murder of Clarke's boyfriend, Rudolph Snead Jr. The boy
had witnessed an earlier driveby shooting in which Peeler allegedly
attempted to kill Snead.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's brother, Adrian, charged with being the actual gunman,
is scheduled to stand trial once Russell's trial is completed. Both
brothers face the possibility of the death penalty if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who was Clarke's manager at U-Haul, grimaced slightly
and looked away when he was asked to look at three photographs of
the crime scene. The jury was shown two of the photos -- one showed
a view of the boy's body at the top of the stairs, while the other
showed grocery bags by the front door.
</P>
<P>
   Later, autopsy photographs of Clarke were passed among the
jurors, but Judge G. Sarsfield Ford did not allow prosecutors to
pass out autopsy photos of B.J.
</P>
<P>
   The judge noted that the jurors had already seen the photos as
they were held up by Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict
and that they would be able to see them again during deliberations.
The enlarged autopsy photos, which showed closeups of the boy's
gunshot wounds, contrasted sharply with a photo the jurors saw
earlier in the day: a smiling little boy wearing a blue denim shirt
and a red tie.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Kanfer, the medical examiner who performed the autopsies,
said B.J. was shot four times -- in the right arm, in the left arm,
in the back and in the head. Kanfer said Clarke had three gunshot
wounds -- two in the chest and one in the right arm -- which may have
been caused by either two or three bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the mother and son were killed the night of Jan.
7, 1999, as they returned home from grocery shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler's defense attorneys objected to prosecutors being allowed
to ask Kanfer about the mere possibility that Clarke may have been
shot twice instead of three times. Attorney William Koch noted that
the state's star witness, Josephine Lee, told police Adrian Peeler
used a revolver, which fires a maximum of six shots. If Clarke was
shot three times and B.J. four times, the total of seven shots
would contradict Lee's statements.
</P>
<P>
   Kanfer testified that Clarke's wounds were consistent with
either two or three shots.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last about four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors plan to call up to 80 witnesses, including Lee, who
lived across the street from Clarke and her son.
</P>
<P>
   Lee originally told police that she heard the two brothers
planning the killings, then acted as a lookout for Adrian Peeler
and watched as he killed the mother and son.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee appeared to recant what she told police in a letter she
wrote to her lawyer in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that I have told them (police) is lies,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she wrote three separate letters to Bridgeport
police officers in which she apologized for her role in the
killings and said she was grateful that the Peelers didn't kill
her.
</P>
<P>
   Lee pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder and agreed to
testify against the brothers in exchange for a maximum sentence of
seven years. She is expected to testify against Russell Peeler next
week.

<HEADLINE> Gov.s Join Biotech Food Promotion  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Governors concerned that opposition to
genetically engineered food could hurt farmers and biotech
companies in their states announced plans Tuesday to use their
political muscle to promote the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 governors hope to reassure the public that ''this isn't
just the big, bad chemical companies trying to engineer something
to jam down your throats,'' said North Dakota Gov. Ed Schafer.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer, a Republican, is co-chairing the Governors
Biotechnology Partnership with Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The governors have yet to finalize a strategy, but they are
patterning the effort after a governors' ethanol coalition that
promotes the corn-based gasoline additive, in part through
sponsoring studies of the product.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Schafer and Vilsack, the governors forming the
biotech coalition include Democrats Mel Carnahan of Missouri and
Tom Carper of Delaware, whose states are home to two of the leading
companies in the industry, Monsanto and DuPont.
</P>
<P>
   The other governors are Republicans Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho,
John Engler of Michigan, Mike Johanns of Nebraska, Kenny Guinn of
Nevada, Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin and George Ryan of Illinois,
and Democrats Frank O'Bannon of Indiana, Jim Hunt of North Carolina
and Gary Locke of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer said the governors hope to coordinate their message with
the biotechnology companies, who last month launched a $50 million
advertising campaign to counter criticism of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Crops have been engineered to stay fresher longer or else to
resist pests and herbicides. The National Academy of Sciences
concluded recently that the biotech food now on the market is safe,
but critics say there isn't enough proof, and some U.S. food
processing companies and fast-food companies have been turning away
from the crops.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration is expected to announce steps
soon, possibly as early Wednesday, that are meant to assure the
public that the food is safe. The steps will include formalizing a
process for biotech companies to consult with FDA and establishing
guidelines for companies that want to label food as free of biotech
ingredients, food industry officials say.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials did not return phone calls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they (the governors) are doing their farmers or
their consumers any benefit by promoting a technology that hasn't
proven to be safe,'' said Charles Margulis, a spokesman for
Greenpeace, an environmental group that has led the opposition to
biotech food. ''I don't think it's going to make much difference to
our side.''
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack, speaking Tuesday at the National Press Club, invoked
the name of Henry Wallace, a liberal icon who was a pioneer in corn
research and later a tireless promoter of New Deal policies while
serving as agriculture secretary and vice president under Franklin
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Genetic engineering is fundamentally no different than the
conventional plant breeding done by Wallace, Vilsack said. Genetic
engineering involves transferring traits from one organism to
another by splicing genes, while conventional breeding methods
include cross pollinating plants and inducing genetic mutations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not new science,'' Vilsack said. ''It's simply quicker
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Rissler, a biotech expert with the Union of Concerned
Scientists, said genetic engineering is ''a very powerful
technology, far more powerful than traditional breeding, just as
nuclear energy is far more powerful than fossil fuels.''

<HEADLINE> Govs Join Biotech Food Promotion  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Governors concerned that opposition to
genetically engineered food could hurt farmers and biotech
companies in their states announced plans Tuesday to use their
political muscle to promote the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 governors hope to reassure the public that ''this isn't
just the big, bad chemical companies trying to engineer something
to jam down your throats,'' said North Dakota Gov. Ed Schafer.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer, a Republican, is co-chairing the Governors
Biotechnology Partnership with Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The governors have yet to finalize a strategy, but they are
patterning the effort after a governors' ethanol coalition that
promotes the corn-based gasoline additive, in part through
sponsoring studies of the product.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Schafer and Vilsack, the governors forming the
biotech coalition include Democrats Mel Carnahan of Missouri and
Tom Carper of Delaware, whose states are home to two of the leading
companies in the industry, Monsanto and DuPont.

<HEADLINE> UN, NATO To Regulate Serbs' Return  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRACANICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo's top U.N. and NATO
officials joined moderate Serbs Tuesday in a committee meant to
regulate the return of Serbs who fled ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Kouchner, Kosovo's U. N. administrator, declined to
specify when Serbs would begin to return to their homes in Kosovo
in large numbers, suggesting that depended on security in the
Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 ethnic Albanians died during the 18-month crackdown
by forces loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and that
has led to revenge killings, which have hampered reconciliation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 100,000 Serbs fled Kosovo fearing reprisals by
ethnic Albanians after NATO and the U.N. moved in to run the
province in June. While many ethnic Albanians remain opposed,
moderate Serbs insist the returns must start soon, to show that
international organizations running the province are serious about
their commitment to ethnic coexistence in the province
</P>
<P>
   ''You want to rush for political reasons,'' said Kouchner after
signing the agreement. ''(For) the maximum of safety we don't want
to take too much risk.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the Rev. Sava Janjic, a spokesman for a moderate group
of Serbs, said he believed the returns could begin as early in
June. He said a group of 50 people would return either to the
heavily damaged village of Osojane, in northwest Kosovo or Slivovo,
a deserted village 10 miles east of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government earlier this year proposed a scheme to
return 700 Serbs to the village of Osojane, and Oliver Ivanovic,
the leader of a radical Serb faction, wants to return as many as
1,500 Serbs in one group. Kouchner said all returns would be
coordinated through the joint committee established Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs mainly live in enclaves and often are escorted by NATO-led
peacekeepers when they venture out of their residences and towns.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner said an open letter will be sent to Ivanovic, Serb
leader in the ethnically divided city of Kosovksa Mitrovica,
inviting him to participate in the agreement. Ivanovic so far has
refused to join any U. N.-led organization.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo's main ethnic Albanian leaders also have agreed to
support the return of other non-Albanians, such as Gypsies, also
known as Roma. About 30,000 are believed to have fled. Roma have
been accused by ethnic Albanians of collaborating with Serb
military forces.

<HEADLINE> Hostage's School Urges Speedy Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOETTINGEN, Germany (AP) -- Students and teachers at the school
where one of the hostages being held in the Philippines works said
Tuesday they are watching with hope for a peaceful resolution of
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Those who work with geography teacher Werner Wallert, 57, said
he is dedicated to his students. He is among the 21 hostages being
held by Muslim rebels along with his wife, Renate, 56, and their
26-year-old son, Marc.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately we can do so little here, but we hope for the
best for the family,'' said Ulrike Koller, head of the 700-student
Theodor Heuss High School.
</P>
<P>
   The school has also been following the crisis on its Web site,
posting updates on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday by journalists who accompanied a doctor
allowed to visit the hostages on the southern Philippine island of
Jolo, Wallert stressed the dire nature of their situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are risking our lives here and if the Philippine government
should try to march in and find a military solution, there will be
bloodshed, nothing else. ... It must be a political solution, it
must be a peaceful solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Renate Wallert is one of two captives who requires
hospitalization, according to the doctor who visited the hostages.
She suffers from cardiopulmonary disease and high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said he has been in
contact with his counterpart in the Philippines, telling ARD
television that he has stressed Germany doesn't want any actions
taken which would endanger the hostages' safety.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer told the Cologne Express newspaper in a report to be
published Wednesday that there has been no direct contact with the
hostages from the German government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hostage-takers are difficult to predict. We must take them
seriously,'' he said, calling for patience in the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Deal Could Reunite Mom, Accused Boy  </HEADLINE>
By JIM IRWIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- The mother of the 6-year-old boy accused of
fatally shooting another first-grader in class will admit she
neglected her children under a deal that could restore her custody
rights, a prosecutor said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between lawyers for the state, Tamarla Owens, and
her children is to be presented to Probate Judge Thomas L. Gadola
on Wednesday. The ultimate goal is to reunite the mother, the young
boy accused of killing 6-year-old Kayla Rolland, and the boy's two
siblings, Genesee County Prosecutor Art Busch said.
</P>
<P>
   A trial had been scheduled for Wednesday on Owens' bid to regain
custody of her children. The agreement means no trial will be held,
but Owens will agree to allow Probate Court to take jurisdiction
over the children, said her lawyer, Mark Clement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the children will continue living with an
aunt and attend school. Owens also will undergo a psychological
evaluation, and will have parenting classes and other counseling as
needed, Busch said.
</P>
<P>
   Busch would not say how soon Owens and her children could resume
living together.
</P>
<P>
   Busch said he isn't alleging that Owens had any responsibility
for Kayla's Feb. 29 shooting death. Police say the boy shot and
killed Kayla at Buell Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   Owens and her husband, Dedric Owens, who is in jail on an
unrelated probation violation, were charged with child neglect
after the school shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Busch said the boys lived in ''shameful conditions'' at Owens'
brother's house, which police have said was used for drug dealing.

<HEADLINE> Two men charged in murder-for-hire of rabbi's wife  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Nearly six years after her beating death, a
private investigator and an unemployed man have come forward to say
they were hired by a rabbi to kill his wife, prosecutors said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both men told investigators they showed up at Carol Neulander's
suburban Cherry Hill home with a lead pipe, intent on killing her,
Camden County Assistant Prosecutor James P. Lynch said in court.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Fred J. Neulander was scheduled to stand trial for the
murder on June 19. Up until Monday, Neulander had been the only
person accused in the Nov. 1, 1994, beating death of his
52-year-old wife. And he was not charged until September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander's lawyers have steadfastly maintained that the rabbi
did not kill his wife, despite accusations of infidelity. Instead
they say she was killed by an intruder in a possible robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Private investigator Leonard Jenoff's claim that he was hired by
Neulander to arrange the killing is an attempt on his part to seek
notoriety, the defense says.
</P>
<P>
   ''In his belittled and befuddled mind, he's become a part of a
major story,'' said Dennis Wixted, a defense lawyer for the rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff, 54, admitted to authorities that he accepted money to
kill the woman and confessed because guilt ''was eating, eating,
eating away at him,'' said Francis Hartman, Jenoff's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Now being held on $200,000 cash bail, Jenoff could face the
death penalty, Hartman said. Hartman is working with prosecutors on
a deal for his client, who is cooperating with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trial is coming up and the thought occurred to him that
the rabbi might be acquitted and that might be a terrible thing,''
Hartman said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Lynch told a judge that Paul Michael Daniels was
''clearly the primary actor in striking the blows.'' Mrs. Neulander
died after being repeatedly beaten, according to the medical
examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Wixted said Jenoff has told investigators nothing that has not
appeared already in media accounts in the years following the
killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not one detail that he has provided that can be
corroborated,'' Wixted said, adding there is ''no weapon, no
fingerprints, no evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Jeffrey Zucker, another of Neulander's defense
team, Jenoff even went so far as to offer pictures of the alleged
killer that had been provided by a psychic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really believe he's deliberately trying to be part of this
case from day one,'' Zucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Zucker and Wixted said they did not hire Jenoff, a longtime
private investigator from Collingswood, or use him in any way as
part of their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Murder for hire is a factor that prosecutors can use to seek the
death penalty for all three defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Lee Solomon refused to comment on any of the details
offered in confessions made by Jenoff and Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon also would not say how the arrests of Daniels and Jenoff
will affect the charges against Neulander. His office ''will review
and re-evaluate'' the entire case and decide whether to seek the
death penalty, Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a decision I'll have to make further down the road,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff and Daniels were arrested Monday night and charged in the
slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Neulander has said he found his wife's body when he
returned from Congregation M'Kor Shalom synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander was indicted in January 1999. He remains free on
$400,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff and Daniels were being held in the Camden County Jail.
Daniels is being held on $400,000 cash bail.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said Neulander had his wife of 29 years killed
so that he could continue his extramarital affair with Philadelphia
radio personality Elaine Soncini.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander reportedly thought divorce would jeopardize his
position as senior rabbi at the synagogue, which he founded with
his wife in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Soncini admitted having a two-year affair with Neulander that
ended shortly after his wife's killing. She has not been charged
with any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods Honors Actors Strike  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tiger Woods was no different Tuesday from
more than 100,000 commercial actors whose anonymous faces and
voices help sell soap, coffee and hundreds of other products. He
was on strike.
</P>
<P>
   The golfer had been scheduled to shoot a Nike commercial at
Islesworth Country Club, his home course near Orlando, Fla. But he
decided to just not do it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a strike going on and we're abiding by it,'' said his
agent, Mark Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' decision was greeted enthusiastically by the Screen
Actors Guild, which authorized the strike along with the American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists. About 135,000 actors
are represented by the unions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We deeply appreciate the support of this international
superstar,'' SAG spokesman Greg Krizman said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' deal with Nike was being renegotiated and could pay him a
reported $80 million to $90 million over five years. The golfer's
TV commercials, including one in which he bounces a golf ball off a
club head, have been eye-catching.
</P>
<P>
   Union membership is mandatory for anyone who appears in more
than one commercial, athletes included. The unions have vowed to
picket film shoots proceeding with nonunion actors or guild members
not honoring the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Nike spokesman Mike Kelly would not reveal the nature of the
commercial, but said the goal was to have it ready in time for the
U.S. Open, which begins June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last I heard it was to be rescheduled,'' Kelly said.
''Tiger's schedule is pretty hectic so it's hard to say. It may be
a couple of months, it may be a couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike centers on the pay structure for commercials. Actors
get a minimum of about $478 for a day's work and also get
''pay-per-play'' residuals of roughly $50 to $120 each time a spot
airs on network television.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to cable TV commercials, however, performers
receive only a flat fee of $1,000 or less for each 13-week,
unlimited run.
</P>
<P>
   With two-thirds of all TV ads now being made for cable, actors
are demanding that pay-per-play be extended to cable as well.
Advertisers, however, want to extend the flat fee from cable to the
networks.

<HEADLINE> Senate Honors 'Peanuts' Creator  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate approved legislation Tuesday
awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to the late Peanuts comic strip
creator Charles Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., praises Schulz for
giving ''the nation a unique sense of optimism, purpose and
pride.''
</P>
<P>
   It was passed by unanimous voice vote. The 77-year-old
cartoonist died in February. He had announced in November he would
retire after being diagnosed with colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed similar legislation earlier. But a slight
difference in wording will require the two versions to be
reconciled before the bill can go to President Clinton.

   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Two months ago, firefighters with the New

climbing a rocky forest slope along the Kittatinny Ridge in Walpack
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   There they were met by federal rangers who stopped them short.
The fire was on federal land, and most of the 40 state firefighters
lacked the safety gear required by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   So Tuesday some of these firefighters ventured to the Statehouse
here to make it plain that their equipment is outdated, their staff
is stretched too thin and many of those who do report to blazes
lack the safety gear that federal authorities have been mandating
since a 1994 disaster in Colorado claimed 14 lives.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey firefighters eventually did go in to knock down
the Walpack blaze, but only after driving 15 miles out of their way
to the headquarters of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation
Area, where rangers handed out ''Nomex'' fire retardant coveralls,
shrouds, helmets and flame shelters designed to give these
so-called Hot Shots a chance to survive if a wall of flame shifts
and overtakes them.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Page, a spokesman for Department of Environmental
Protection Commissioner Robert Shinn, said Shinn was unaware of
these complaints before Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The commissioner has agreed to review what they have to say
and consider whether we have to shift money around to meet other
equipment needs,'' Page said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed budget provides $4 million for the fire service,
which has 88 full-timers and a roster of 1,050 seasonal part-timers
standing by to be called to fight fires around the clock. The
budget includes $1.9 million for equipment, including nine new
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Environmental Protection spokeswoman Sharon
Southard said the funding, staffing and fire calls have been stable
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Aughenbaugh, president of the New Jersey Deputy Fire
Chiefs Association, said a one-time grant of an additional $3.6
million is needed for new equipment to outfit all firefighters with
safety gear, to replace old trucks and to repair grounded
helicopters and equip them with smoke vision equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is serious. We do not want to lose a firefighter
in the state of New Jersey,'' Aughenbaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the added $3.6 million could be used to replace 24 fire
trucks and 10 bulldozers, and to hire 19 more full-timers as
firefighters and fire wardens. He said the current Department of
Environmental Protection budget proposal would add 16 state park
rangers but only one firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the firefighters at the protest asked not to be
identified. One supervisor told of how most of the part-timers
working on his ''line'' wear only dungarees and flannel shirts,
which became worrisome last year at a Pinelands fire when a meadow
suddenly went up in a sheet of flame ''as if it was soaked in
gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   ''These people had to run full blast back for the truck, and if
it had not been there (or if it had broken down), someone would
have gotten burned because none of them were wearing the right
gear,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Assembly members spoke to the small group promising
to press ahead with legislation to provide the special funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now there is a deaf ear in this administration to the
needs of these firefighters,'' said Assemblyman Neil Cohen,
D-Union. ''If we don't act now in anticipation of another drought
season, we could be in serious danger.''

<HEADLINE> Second report uncovers additional school cheating  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Six months after uncovering widespread cheating
on standardized tests, a city education watchdog charged Tuesday
that nine teachers at eight schools improperly assisted students
during testing.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, a fifth-grader was reduced to tears when a
teacher allegedly berated the boy for refusing to write down an
answer provided by the instructor, according to the report by
Special Commissioner of Investigation Edward Stancik.
</P>
<P>
   Equally shocking, the teacher's written explanation of what
happened was rife with misspellings and errors in grammar.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in room 245 helping supervised,'' he wrote. ''I took the
examen to two or three students because they were talking without
control.'' One of the students later told the school principal ''I
said (told) her the answers of the test,'' the teacher wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Stancik, summing up his latest probe in a 20-page letter to
schools Chancellor Harold Levy, said additional reports of cheating
surfaced following his initial investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again we found proctors who gave answers to students,
alerted them to wrong responses and changed student choices after
the exam was turned in,'' Stancik wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a teacher used the actual questions from the state
English Language Assessment to drill her students in preparation
for the exam. In another, one teacher provided the class with the
correct answers to the first 11 questions.
</P>
<P>
   Schools Chancellor Harold Levy responded to the allegations in a
statement issued Tuesday. ''I support Special Commissioner
Stancik's efforts to rid the public schools of teacher-assisted
cheating and have taken three actions in response to his report.''
</P>
<P>
   First, Levy has asked his general counsel to review the report
and determine its legitimacy. If it proves true, the chancellor
plans to take disciplinary action. Next, he is directing a
monitoring effort for Thursday's citywide math tests.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Levy has asked Stancik ''to assist future monitoring
activities by dispatching his investigators to schools in
coordination with the Board during the administration of
high-stakes tests.''
</P>
<P>
   United Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said
that if Stancik's allegations were true, ''there should be serious
consequences.'' But the UFT has an independent investigator
reviewing the report to see if the charges are accurate.
</P>
<P>
   In his December report, Stancik found that teachers and
administrators at 32 New York City schools helped students cheat on
standardized tests by providing them with questions in advance and
even marking test forms for them.

<HEADLINE> Fen-Phen Settlement Hearings Begin  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Opponents of a proposed $3.75 billion
national settlement of health claims against the diet drug
combination fen-phen called the deal inadequate Tuesday as a judge
began hearing testimony on the fairness of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Louis C. Bechtle, who gave preliminary
approval to the deal in November, is expected to decide at the end
of the two-week hearing whether the settlement will stand.
</P>
<P>
   Edward F. Blizzard, an attorney for a group of fen-phen users
who object to the settlement, wants the judge to throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plan is illegal and unfair,'' Blizzard said Tuesday. ''The
amounts being offered to settle these claims are inadequate to
compensate people for their injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug's maker, American Home Products, and plaintiffs'
attorneys who worked out the settlement last October favor its
approval.
</P>
<P>
   More than 9,000 lawsuits have been filed against Madison,
N.J.-based American Home, maker of fenfluramine, the ''fen'' in the
fen-phen combination. The company sold the drug under the brand
name of Pondimin and also made Redux, a chemical cousin.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs were withdrawn in September 1997 after a Mayo Clinic
study linked the fen-phen combination to potentially fatal heart
valve damage. The second drug in the combination, phentermine, was
not linked to the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, the fen-phen users would get a maximum of
$1.5 million, though most would get far less, depending on their
level of injury and how long they took the drugs. The settlement
also includes money for their future medical monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ''The settlement is the result of a dedicated effort between
plaintiffs' attorneys and American Home Products to create a
comprehensive and equitable plan,'' said Louis L. Hoynes Jr.,
American Home's senior vice president and general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Of 6 million people who took fen-phen before it was pulled from
the market, 45,000 refused the settlement and retain the right to
sue for punitive damages. Those who remained in the class action
may still reject the settlement and sue for compensatory damages
but are forbidden from collecting punitive damages.

<HEADLINE> Crowded Race for Governor in N.C.  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Thirteen candidates vied Tuesday for the
chance to succeed retiring Gov. Jim Hunt, with Democrats sparring
over education programs and Republicans challenging each other's
conservative credentials.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, with 14 percent of precincts reporting, GOP Rep.
David McIntosh led with 35,428 votes, or 71 percent, in his effort
to win the nomination to challenge first-term Democratic Gov. Frank
O'Bannon. John Price, a lawyer who toured the state in a red school
bus, had 14,549 votes, or 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional races in both states drew heavy competition.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout, however, was expected to be low in both states since
the Republican and Democratic nominees for president are all but
final. George W. Bush and Al Gore already have won the necessary
number of delegates.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, Bush won the GOP nomination with 81 percent of the
vote, and Gore won with 76 percent. Voters in Washington, D.C.,
also made their presidential choices Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, North Carolina's governor from 1975 to 1983 and re-elected
to two more terms starting in 1993, is barred by state law from
seeking another term. The Democrat is one of the state's best-known
politicians, with approval ratings exceeding 70 percent. He did not
endorse any candidate.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, the two leading Democrats seeking his seat
-- Lt. Gov. Dennis Wicker and state Attorney General Mike Easley --
argued over how best to strengthen education programs with money
from a not-yet-approved state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The leading Republicans fought over who was more conservative.
Former Charlotte Mayor Richard Vinroot and state Rep. Leo Daughtry
criticized each other's conservative record on spending and
abortion, while debating whether to use attack ads. Former state
Rep. Chuck Neely avoided most of that fight.
</P>
<P>
   Easley, a 50-year-old former state prosecutor who ran
unsuccessfully for Senate in 1990, led by as much as 20 points in
independent polls, but a poll last week showed his margin slipping
below 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Vinroot, who ran unsuccessfully for the GOP nomination for
governor in 1996, held a small lead over Daughtry, former majority
leader of the state House. Neely, a 57-year-old Raleigh lawyer who
served two terms in the state House, was close behind.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a runoff, the winning candidate in each party must get
more than 40 percent of the vote. In all, there were seven
Democrats, four Republicans and two Libertarians running.
</P>
<P>
   In congressional races, three Republicans and a Libertarian are
seeking to challenge Rep. Mel Watt, a Democrat whose district's
lines are being challenged in federal court. Critics allege it was
drawn with an unconstitutional emphasis on race.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, conservative three-term Rep. McIntosh's decision to
run for governor set off a scramble to represent his east-central
Indiana district, which includes Muncie. Among the 11 candidates in
early results, former radio talk show host Mike Pence held a narrow
lead over Republican state Rep. Jeff Linder.
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh and Price were seeking the GOP nomination to challenge
O'Bannon, who has no opposition for the Democratic nomination.
Price promised to visit all 92 counties in his red bus.

<HEADLINE> Corzine launches attack on Florio over taxes, recession  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- U.S. Senate candidate Jon Corzine has
pulled the trigger on one of the biggest weapons in his arsenal, an
attack on opponent Jim Florio over his tax increases as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said Tuesday they are surprised to see this
punch thrown this hard or this early in the battle for the
Democratic primary nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It suggests that the Corzine campaign may be feeling some
weakness or frustration in their effort to familiarize voters with
their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is probably testimony to the fact that Florio is holding a
lead, and that it is not decaying as fast as Corzine and his people
would be comfortable with,'' said political analyst Jim McQueeny.
</P>
<P>
   Polls gave Florio an edge of up to 2-to-1 among registered
Democrats but they are more than a month out of date, a period
during which Corzine has poured millions into television.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Florio increased income tax rates, raised the sales
tax and expanded the taxable categories to raise a combined $2.8
billion in revenue. The move came in response to a sharp dip in
state revenues that foretold a brief but painful economic
recession.
</P>
<P>
   Public outrage resulted in a disastrous 1991 election season for
Democrats, who lost majority control of the Senate and Assembly. By
1993, Florio himself had rebounded in public approval but not quite
enough, losing re-election to Gov. Christie Whitman on her promise
to cut some of those taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Corzine 30-second ad hits Florio for the taxes, 280,000 lost
jobs, 200,000 people without health insurance, spiraling auto
insurance rates, then climaxes with the question: ''Do we want to
go back to that?''
</P>
<P>
   The commercial then flips to Corzine's friendly face and offers:
''Welcome to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider University political analyst David Rebovich said he
thought the negative ad was being used surprisingly early in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''He came out negative early because he apparently had to. The
feel-good ads apparently weren't doing it,'' Rebovich said. ''They
haven't given him the name recognition that he had hoped, and he
has not moved voters away from Florio.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Pomper of Rutgers University disagreed. He did not think
the negative attack was too early. What it was, Pomper said, was
too harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Corzine has framed that debate, that issue, that
consideration, correctly. But I also think it may be that it is too
rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it backfire? ''Oh definitely, especially if it is on too
long,'' Pomper said.
</P>
<P>
   McQueeny said he thought it was fair. ''It does take on the
record, not just the guy,'' he said. ''It is not personal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florio campaign, which has not spent money on TV commercials
and has no plan to do so soon, insists the hardball tactic will not
affect their strategy or timing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our game plan remains the same. We are pleased with our
position right now,'' said spokesman Jim Lanard. ''What Mr. Corzine
has done is to show a desperate act of a desperate campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio aide Walter Fields, who has spearheaded some of Florio's
most negative attacks on the campaign trail, said their offensive
tactic has forced Corzine's campaign to reply.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly we believe we have caused them to rethink their
campaign. I think there was a sense in the Corzine campaign that by
simply dumping money into this campaign they could overwhelm Jim
Florio's candidacy, and it has not worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine spokesman Steve Goldstein acknowledged that they were
responding in some sense to Florio's initiative, but not for the
reasons Fields cites.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said they rolled out the attack ad now because Florio
has been spending more and more time discussing and defending his
1990 taxes, perhaps to defuse the bomb before Corzine could drop
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was Jim Florio himself, not Jon Corzine or the Corzine
campaign, who injected the issue of Florio's tax increase into this
campaign,'' Goldstein said. ''Our campaign is not doing anything
differently now than it had planned. If there was a slight
acceleration, it was because of Gov. Florio's intentions to discuss
the tax cut and to defend it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It had us here scratching our heads,'' Goldstein added.
''There is no remorse. He is not sorry at all.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Hepatitis A Exposure Feared  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- More than 700 children may have been
exposed to hepatitis A when they ate strawberry-topped waffles for
breakfast in a Head Start program.
</P>
<P>
   The children, ages 3 to 5, were to be immunized against the
disease Wednesday, said Francie Wise, director of communicable
disease control in Contra Costa County, east of San Francisco. The
139 adults who ate the strawberries will also be immunized.
</P>
<P>
   Sysco Corp. distributed the frozen fruit, which was served April
21. One week later, the company said the strawberries may have been
contaminated with the virus. A phone call to Houston-based Sysco
was not returned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It takes 15 to 50 days for symptoms to appear, and none of the
students has complained of illness, Wise said.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis A affects the liver. Wise said it is relatively mild
in children but can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and jaundice
in adults. The virus is often transmitted by someone who does not
wash his or her hands after using the restroom.

<HEADLINE> Hilbert Gets Cash, Jet Privileges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Stephen C. Hilbert left Conseco Inc. with a
severance package that included $72.4 million in cash, security
service at his home and the right to use the company's corporate
jets up to 20 times a year.
</P>
<P>
   Hilbert also received a $3.35 million bonus for the first three
months of this year. Last Wednesday -- the day before the board
replaced Hilbert -- it granted him options to buy 2 million shares
of Conseco stock, exercisable at $5.75 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Those options have appreciated by $2.5 million since his
departure and could be worth millions more by the time they expire
in 2003. Conseco disclosed the details of Hilbert's severance
package in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
late Monday, after the stock markets closed for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Hilbert, 54, built Conseco into one of Indiana's biggest
businesses, but company shares began a long slide after the company
announced in April 1998 that it was buying mobile home lender Green
Tree Financial Corp. for $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Rollin M. Dick, who stepped down Thursday as executive vice
president and chief financial officer, did not receive nearly as
lucrative a severance package. He will continue to collect his
salary of $250,000 a year through the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Dick also received a bonus of $187,000 for the first three
months of this year and options to buy 600,000 shares of Conseco
stock, at a price of $5.75 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Conseco were off 37{ cents Tuesday at $6.62{ on the
New York Stock Exchange, well off their 52-week high of $35.31\.

<HEADLINE> Florio's mother, Lillian, dead at 82  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Lillian Hazel Florio, mother of former
governor and current U.S. Senate candidate Jim Florio, died early
Tuesday. She was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Florio died at a southern New Jersey nursing home where she
had spent recent years. Arrangements and a cause of death were not
released. Her husband, Vincenzo Florio, whom she married in 1936,
died several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Florio canceled campaign events Tuesday, and his campaign staff
said a family memorial service would be conducted in private.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign news release, Florio praised his mother as
''gracious and strong-willed,'' adding he and his brother, Richard,
would miss her and her droll sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Florio has frequently cited his mother on the campaign trial
when questioned about his 1990 tax increases, saying the extra
revenue was needed ''to pay the bills,'' a value he learned from
Lillian Florio during his working-class upbringing in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rent money would go in the coffee can on the shelf, the
Chase &AMP; Sanborn coffee can, because she said you gotta pay your
bills,'' Florio said at a recent appearance. ''It was her value
system, and it is my value system.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Kennedy Talks About His Grief  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Sen. Edward M. Kennedy says he doesn't believe in
the curse of the Kennedy family.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, that's not the way we've been,'' Kennedy said when asked
about the curse in an interview taped for CBS' ''60 Minutes II,'
airing Tuesday night. '' ... I've been very, very fortunate and
very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, D-Mass., talked about his grief over the death of his
nephew John F. Kennedy Jr., who died when his plane crashed in
July.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, it once
again fell upon Edward Kennedy, whose brothers President John F.
Kennedy and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated, to lead the
family in grief.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prayers, the notes make a great deal of difference to
me,'' Kennedy said. ''And they did last summer. I suppose I don't
do as well as maybe others in being able to sort of talk about
those inner feelings and emotions that have been very close to my
... heart and soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's niece and John F. Kennedy Jr.'s sister, Caroline
Kennedy, said the public Kennedy is different from the one the
family knows.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess it's hard for me to realize that people don't see
Teddy the way that we in our family do.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody was more amazing than Teddy last summer,'' she said.
''If there was anything that came out of that, I think it was a
kind of appreciation I got for how lucky I am to be in our
family.''

<HEADLINE> China Trade Backers Optimistic  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Backers of granting China permanent trade
benefits expressed new optimism Tuesday that they will prevail in a
tough showdown three weeks from now. President Clinton asserted
that the trade bill's rejection would be ''very, very unwise and
precarious.''
</P>
<P>
   To press his case, Clinton met with about 20 Democrats and
Republicans Tuesday evening at the White House to try to persuade
them to vote for permanent normal trade relations with China. He
brought along Martin Lee, leader of Hong Kong's Democratic Party,
to help him argue in favor of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Lee said that he had been warmly received but that he
didn't know if he'd secured any more yes votes for the measure. Lee
wants the United States to grant normal trade status with China,
but wants America and other members of the global trade forum to
pressure China for reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's no deal, then what?'' he asked reporters. ''Would
human rights improve in China, or would China, in fact, be more
suppressive, seeing that the United States is no longer engaged?''
</P>
<P>
   This was Clinton's seventh meeting with undecided lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are optimistic. We are making our case,'' P.J. Crowley, a
spokesman for the National Security Council, told reporters. ''This
is still going to be a struggle. It's still going to be a tight
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, supporters picked up a key swing vote, that of Rep.
Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the first member of the House Democratic
leadership to back the pact. Hoyer had previously been uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
   And top House Republican leaders suggested they would consider
supporting a Democratic-sponsored proposal to set up a watchdog
commission to monitor human rights in China -- if it helps win
overall passage of the China trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   With the House back from a two-week spring recess, supporters
claimed that momentum was with them -- or at least that Democratic
defections had slowed despite heavy lobbying by labor unions and
the disapproval of House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration clearly had little success with its plan
to fly dozens of undecided House members to China during that
recess to persuade them to support the bill.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, only two undecided members -- Reps. Gregory Meeks,
D-N.Y., and Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas -- took the trip, and both
returned still undecided. They were accompanied by two members who
already supported the measure: Reps. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., and
Greg Walden, R-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish more had gone on the trip,'' Meeks said. ''I thought
the trip was very beneficial. It gave me much more insight into
China and the Chinese people.'' But he said he needs more time to
decide.
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota Gov. Ed Schafer, a Republican also on the trip,
said he tried to persuade the two undecideds to vote for the trade
bill, but that ''they kept getting phone calls from the unions....
And the unions were saying, 'We gotta talk, don't make (decisions),
and when you get back, we want our time with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., the Clinton administration's point
man on the legislation, predicted an overall victory when the House
takes up the bill the week of May 22, expecting the support of 70
to 80 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   If Republican leaders can produce an expected 150-160 GOP votes,
then the legislation -- which needs 218 votes in the 435-member
House -- will pass, Matsui said. ''It's still going to be a tough
battle. But I feel very good about where we are right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to win,'' asserted U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky during a question session after a speech to the
Council of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Rep. Lois Capps, D-Calif., another previously
undecided member, announced her support for the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   And House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, told that
reporters Republicans were doing their part. ''We have picked up a
couple of good votes on our side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Armey and Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, indicated they might support a proposal
by Rep. Sander Levin of Michigan, the committee's senior Democrat,
designed to make the bill more palatable to those concerned about
human rights and labor rights.
</P>
<P>
   Levin would set up a watchdog commission to monitor human rights
in China and could recommend economic sanctions. The Clinton
administration has signaled it could accept such a measure if it is
the cost of winning overall support for the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, where the legislation has wide bipartisan support,
is expected to take up the measure after the House vote, probably
in June.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would grant China permanent normal trade relations,
putting it on the same footing as nearly every other country with
which the United States trades. Currently, China's trade status
must be reviewed annually.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also ease China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton presented one of his strongest cases yet for the
legislation on Tuesday, during a speech before a conference of the
Independent Insurance Agents of America.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a national security point of view, it would in my view be
a very, very unwise and precarious move to say that the United
States doesn't care whether they're part of the world community or
not,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said there was still time to defeat the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a very close vote,'' said Fred Clarke, a
spokesman for House Democratic Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., a
leading opponent of the legislation.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Stock Down Over Profit Warning  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE MEYERSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T's stock slid 14 percent Tuesday as the
company issued its first profit warning under chief executive C.
Michael Armstrong, fueling worries about whether his radical remake
of the nation's largest long-distance company will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointing forecast, which came as AT&AMP;T posted
first-quarter results that met most expectations, dampened the
enthusiasm created by last week's initial public offering of $10.6
billion worth of stock in the company's wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, shares of the new AT&AMP;T Wireless Group also fell Tuesday
even as three major brokerages initiated coverage of the stock with
a ''buy'' recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, price wars in consumer long-distance ranked high
among the culprits that prompted AT&AMP;T's revised outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Job cuts in that unit are already a major part of Armstrong's
plan to cut $2 billion in costs during 2000, and the company
reported Tuesday that 6,200 workers were notified in the first
quarter that their positions are being eliminated, mostly in
long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't clear, however, whether the worsening backdrop for
long-distance would lead to even more aggressive cost-cutting in
that unit. Still, since cost cuts totaled only $300 million in the
first quarter, there would seem to be plenty of pain to come this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to speculate on job cuts, although we're
certainly going to focus on the cost infrastructure of all legacy
businesses,'' said chief financial officer Charles Noski, referring
to AT&AMP;T's traditional telephone operations.
</P>
<P>
   More unexpected than the troubles in consumer long-distance was
the weakness AT&AMP;T reported in the far more profitable business of
providing long-distance service to companies and other high-volume
users, as well as the revelation of regulatory delays in the
company's purchase of cable provider MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   The discouraging update raised new questions about AT&AMP;T's
ambitious bid to become a new-age communications company,
highlighted by an investment of more than $100 billion to buy and
upgrade cable systems for telephone calls and high-speed Internet
services.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, already slightly dubious about whether a company so
large can pull off such a dramatic transformation, wasted no time
in trashing the stock. AT&AMP;T fell $7.12{ per share to $41.87{,
finishing only a shade above its 52-week low, while AT&AMP;T Wireless
fell $3.25 a share to $32, also on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call following Tuesday's profit report, AT&AMP;T
said it now expects to produce full-year operating profits of
between $1.80 and $1.85 per share rather than the previous estimate
of $1.89 to $1.94.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three months of this year, AT&AMP;T earned $1.73
billion, or 53 cents a share, excluding one-time factors and some
ownership interests that produced a net profit of $1.74 billion, or
54 cents a share, for the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The operating profit matched the 53 cents expected by most
analysts, according to a survey by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's first quarter, AT&AMP;T posted an operating profit of
$1.72 billion, but the per-share breakdown amounted to a heftier 61
cents because the company had not yet issued an avalanche of new
stock in its purchase of cable provider Tele-Communications Inc.
After one-time items, AT&AMP;T's net income totaled $1.08 billion, or
38 cents a share, in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues came to $15.84 billion in the latest quarter, up 5.8
percent from the combined revenues of $14.97 billion posted a year
ago by AT&AMP;T and the soon-to-be acquired operations of TCI and IBM
Global Network, an Internet services business.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless revenue grew more than 40 percent from year-ago levels,
while revenues from business services such as high-speed Internet
grew at a high-teen rate.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Urge School Repair Funds  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 20 million schoolchildren nationwide
attend schools that are falling apart or ill-equipped for classroom
computers, the nation's largest teachers union says in a report
calling on states to pony up their budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, states need $322 billion for school construction --
roughly 10 times what they currently spend and nearly three times
what the federal government has estimated they need, the National
Education Association said in a report to be released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, has estimated that the nation's schools need $112 billion
for repair and update of buildings 74 percent of which the
Association of School Administrators says were built before 1970.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and congressional Democrats are pushing
increased federal funds for school repair and construction. But
states bear most of the responsibility for such costs, and they
have been spending more than ever, the union says.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crisis is eclipsing their efforts,'' said Bob Chase,
president of the union, which analyzed recent state finance data
for the report. ''We often fail to recognize that where our
students learn can have a dramatic effect on what they learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual state needs, the union's report said, vary widely
because some states are more populated or have higher costs for
land and building materials. New York tops the list, needing $51
billion; Vermont, a much-smaller state, needs about $333 million.'
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the report said, states had a $31 billion surplus in
fiscal 1999. States such as Alaska, Indiana and Delaware have the
highest portion of budget surpluses, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The union's estimates are based on 1998 and 1999 data that
include school enrollments, age and condition of existing
buildings, and construction costs, said spokesman Steve Wollmer.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Pennsylvania has spent $1.2 billion on
reimbursements for building and repair in its 501 school districts,
said Al Bowman, spokesman for the state's Education Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''There hasn't been a great call from school districts for more
assistance because we have provided an adequate level,'' Bowman
noted. ''School districts make the decision to go through with a
construction project. It's locally controlled and locally
decided.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says however, that states could use budget surpluses
to make ''immediate, productive investments in school
modernization.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the school construction cost estimates cover bricks and
mortar, but $54 billion is needed to help wire schools for the
computer technology many policymakers have been keen on funding,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   When Lincoln Middle School in Indianapolis was re-built in 1997,
special attention was paid to wiring every classroom for computers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like night and day,'' said Virgil Taueg, principal of the
800-student school. ''Between the building itself and the
technology, we have so many more opportunities than we did in our
old school.''
</P>
<P>
   Three in four states have technology plans, Chase said, but most
of them don't have any plans to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, several Democrats in Congress -- which is debating
renewal of $20 billion in federal education aid to the states --
said they want the federal government to spend at least $1.3
billion on school construction. But Republican leaders have
resisted setting aside specific funds for school building,
Democrats said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a national disgrace,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.
''Many schools have a tax base too low to fix their schools.
Republicans have pulled the rug out from under them.''
</P>
<P>
   The two parties sparred over whose policies ensure school funds
are well spent. Republicans want states and local districts to have
more freedom to combine funds from grant programs to suit their
needs. Democrats want to target the money to specific concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The differences could hinder the Senate's work on the education
bill, with both sides threatening to attach a host of proposals to
the already cumbersome piece of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Tuesday
that Republican leaders do not plan to limit debate, and the
parties agreed to offer two separate proposals each.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's not make this a piece of flypaper to attract every
amendment floating around this chamber,'' Lott said. ''There is a
center ground that must and should be found in America on
education.''

<HEADLINE> Court Hears Confederate Flag Flap  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- The squabble over the lieutenant
governor's decision to prevent a protest over the Confederate
battle emblem on the state flag moved to the state Supreme Court
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the high court blocked a judge's ruling that found
Lt. Gov. Amy Tuck had violated the constitution. Justices will
review written arguments filed Tuesday and rule later.
</P>

   Tuck was sued over the weekend by seven black senators after she
refused to let them have bills read aloud before votes, a common
legislative practice of protest.
</P>
<P>
   At least one black legislator wanted to have 110 budget bills
read to bring attention to the failure of a proposal to remove the
Confederate Battle flag from the state banner.
</P>
<P>
   Tuck said the bill reading could have kept lawmakers from ending
the four-month session on time at the end of the week.

<HEADLINE> Arist Ousts Founder Clive Davis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Music executive Clive Davis, who helped launch
the careers of pop stars like Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen, has
lost a power struggle over his future at Arista Records, the
company he founded 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   BMG Entertainment, a division of German media conglomerate
Bertelsmann, announced Tuesday that Antonio ''L.A.'' Reid will take
Davis' spot as head of Arista on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''Antonio brings to Arista an inspired track record as a
businessman, Grammy award-winning producer and deeply committed
record man,'' said Strauss Zelnick, chief executive of BMG
Entertainment, which owns Arista.
</P>
<P>
   The move ends a six-month feud between Davis, 66, and his
corporate bosses. Bertelsmann traditionally enforces a retirement
age of 60 on its top executives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Though I regret the imposition of the Bertelsmann retirement
age policy, it's time now to turn to a new and vital chapter in
this fast changing world of music,'' Davis said in a statement. A
publicist, Howard Rubenstein, said Davis is weighing offers from
BMG and others to create a new company.
</P>
<P>
   BMG had been grooming Reid, an executive with LaFace Records and
an accomplished record producer with partner Babyface, as a
potential successor and sent him to Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   At Arista, Davis presided over a pop empire that includes
Whitney Houston, Sarah McLachlan, Sean ''Puffy'' Combs, Aretha
Franklin, Monica and Deborah Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' career began at CBS Records in the 1960s, signing artists
like Janis Joplin, Billy Joel and Springsteen. He was fired in 1973
when the label accused him of mismanaging funds, but he quickly
founded Arista, which has been a haven for artists mostly in the
pop and rhythm 'n' blues fields. Arista was sold to Bertelsmann in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many music executives who concern themselves strictly
with business, Davis often took an active role in molding artists
by producing albums and picking the songs they record.

<HEADLINE> Easley Leads Democrats in NC  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- State Attorney General Mike Easley led
Democratic candidates in early returns Tuesday and former Charlotte
Mayor Richard Vinroot led Republicans in bids to succeed retiring
Gov. Jim Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   With 11 percent of precincts reporting, Easley had 31,178 votes,
or 61 percent, to Lt. Gov. Dennis Wicker's 17,782 votes, or 35
percent. Vinroot had 14,455 votes, or 46 percent, to state Rep. Leo
Daughtry's 10,920 votes, or 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, conservative Rep. David McIntosh won the GOP
nomination to challenge first-term Democratic Gov. Frank O'Bannon.
With 29 percent of precincts reporting, he had 93,128 votes, or 70
percent of the vote. He defeated John Price, a lawyer who toured
the state in a red school bus, who had 38,969 votes, or 30 percent.
O'Bannon had no opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional races in both states drew heavy competition.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout, however, appeared light in both states with the
Republican and Democratic nominees for president all but final.
George W. Bush and Al Gore already have won the necessary number of
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore easily won their nominations in Indiana and North
Carolina. Voters in Washington, D.C., also made their presidential
choices Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, North Carolina's governor from 1975 to 1983 and re-elected
to two more terms starting in 1993, is barred by state law from
seeking another term. The Democrat is one of the state's best-known
politicians, with approval ratings exceeding 70 percent. He did not
endorse any of the 13 candidates.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Wicker and Easley argued over how best to
strengthen education programs with money from a not-yet-approved
state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Vinroot and Daughtry criticized each other's conservative record
on spending and abortion, while debating whether to use attack ads.
Former state Rep. Chuck Neely avoided most of that fight, and
trailed with 17 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Easley, a 50-year-old former state prosecutor, ran
unsuccessfully for Senate in 1990. Vinroot ran unsuccessfully for
the GOP nomination for governor in 1996. Daughtry was former
majority leader of the state House.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a runoff, the winning candidate in each party must get
more than 40 percent of the vote. In all, there were seven
Democrats, four Republicans and two Libertarians running.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to challenge Democratic Rep. Mel Watt in the fall,
history teacher Chad Mitchell led with 1,343 votes in early
returns, or 47 percent, to gourmet coffee shop owner John
Cosgrove's 1,073 votes, or 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Watt's district's lines are being challenged in federal court by
critics who allege it was drawn with an unconstitutional emphasis
on race.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, three-term Rep. McIntosh's decision to run for
governor set off a scramble among 11 candidates to represent his
east-central Indiana district, which includes Muncie.
</P>
<P>
   With 33 percent of the precincts reporting, former radio talk
show host Mike Pence led with 6,142 votes, or 44 percent, over
Republican state Rep. Jeff Linder, who had 3,942 votes, or 28
percent.

Ontario Celebrates Death of Budget Deficit
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Explosive economic growth has enabled the Ontario
government to balance its books, cut taxes, boost health-care
spending and even pony up a billion-dollar ''dividend'' on last
year's taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservative government celebrated the death of the deficit
Tuesday with a $1.4-billion increase in health funding and more of
the tax cuts that first propelled the party to power in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The budget, balanced fully in Ontario for the first time in 30
years, also featured more money for schools and universities, a
battery of new anti-crime squads and $1 billion for the province's
aging network of highways.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to last year's mighty economic surge, the Tories will
also start reducing the $114-billion debt faster than planned,
spending at least $1 billion on debt each year, said Finance
Minister Ernie Eves.
</P>
<P>
   And Ontarians also get a ''dividend'' check of up to $200 for
last year's taxes, at a cost to the government of about $1 billion.

British Airways: Ottawa Should Rein in Air Canada
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Air Canada's ''near monopoly'' over Canadian skies
will drive up fares domestically and internationally if Ottawa
doesn't step in to ensure other carriers can compete, British
Airways warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   New federal legislation must ensure that Air Canada doesn't
drive out competition, which is vital to protecting consumer choice
and keeping air fares affordable, British Airways representatives
told the Commons transport committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Legislation to ensure that Air Canada's near monopoly does not
extract a heavy price to consumers is essential,'' said lawyer
Robert Russell, who represents three international airlines:
British Airways, Air France and Cathay Pacific.

Tom Long: Quebecers Like His Small-Government Message
</P>
<P>
   SHAWINIGAN, Quebec (AP) -- Canadian Alliance leadership hopeful
Tom Long stood by the Saint-Maurice River in Jean Chretien's riding
Tuesday and said federal support for an ornamental fountain
typifies the prime minister's arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   Long berated the federal Liberals for giving $200,000 in
job-creation money toward the $500,000 fountain, which is to be
built in the middle of the river.
</P>
<P>
   He said it demonstrates Chretien's ''arrogant disregard'' for
how taxpayers' money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is as powerful a symbol as I can think of, of the
difference Canadians are going to see between a Canadian Alliance
government under my leadership and what they've had under Jean
Chretien and his Liberals,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   In Ottawa, however, Chretien defended the federal contribution
to the fountain, saying it accounts for only a small portion of the
funding for the tourist attraction.

Newspapers, Radio, TV To Face Ownership review
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- A government review of media ownership rules will
include radio and television, not just newspapers, says Heritage
Minister Sheila Copps.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials have been reviewing concentration of media
ownership in Canada for several months and are looking at aligning
newspaper and broadcast ownership regulations, Copps said.
</P>
<P>
   Copps was expanding on comments Monday that the government is
reviewing newspaper ownership, including rules that have the effect
of restricting foreign holdings to 25 per cent of a newspaper
company.
</P>
<P>
   The review was begun long before newspaper baron Conrad Black's
Hollinger group put 350 small and mid-sized newspapers in Canada
and the United States up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson Corp., owner of the Globe and Mail and five other
dailies including the Winnipeg Free Press, said in February that it
plans to sell all its newspapers except the Globe.

BC Premier's Son To Plead Not Guilty to Assault Charges
</P>
<P>
   WINDSOR, Ontario (AP) -- A son of British Columbia Premier Ujjal
Dosanjh will plead not guilty to charges he assaulted a police
officer and caused a disturbance after a violent scuffle with
police outside a downtown bar, his lawyer said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will plead not guilty for sure,'' said Patrick Ducharme,
lawyer for 24-year-old Asseem Dosanjh.
</P>
<P>
   Dosanjh was charged earlier Tuesday following his arrest over
the weekend. He had been celebrating his law-school graduation from
the University of Windsor when the melee broke out.
</P>
<P>
   He was released on $500 bail and will appear in court again on
May 26.
</P>
<P>
   According to a police news release, punches were exchanged,
pepper spray was used by police and clothing was torn in the
Saturday morning skirmish.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Probed in Lumumba Slaying  </HEADLINE>
By RAF CASERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Belgium's parliament opened an
investigation Tuesday into possible government involvement in the
1961 killing of Congo's first premier, Patrice Lumumba, whose death
shocked the world during the turbulent months following Congolese
independence from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary inquiry follows publication of the book ''The
Murder of Lumumba,'' which claims Belgium was responsible for the
logistics behind the capture and execution of the fierce opponent
of Congo's old colonial masters.
</P>
<P>
   Lumumba was revered by many, in Africa and the West, as an
enlightened anti-colonial crusader. But in the Cold War politics of
the time, he was also depicted as a pro-communist agitator.
</P>
<P>
   Previous theories on his killing have centered on U.S.
involvement, or political rivalries within Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ''A self-respecting nation should not fear the past and must
have the courage to investigate possible errors,'' said Liberal
Party legislator Geert Versnick, who on Tuesday was elected
chairman of a committee to investigate whether Belgium played a
role in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the bloody turmoil that followed independence, Lumumba was
abducted by Congolese rivals, taken to the breakaway province of
Katanga and killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole murder was orchestrated from Brussels, with
cooperation from Congolese,'' Ludo De Witte, the writer of ''The
Murder of Lumumba'' told the newspaper De Standaard recently.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most widely-quoted elements suggesting possible
government involvement is a cable from then-African Affairs
Minister Harold d'Aspremont Lynden stating that ''the most
important objective for Congo, Katanga and, of course, Belgium, is
the final elimination of Lumumba.''
</P>
<P>
   With the establishment of the parliamentary committee,
historians will now be able to consult archives which had
previously been closed to them.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which is expected to last one year, comes at
a time when Belgium is trying to refocus its policies toward
central Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian Foreign Minister Louis Michel recently met with
Congolese President Laurent Kabila during a tour of the region, and
Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt went to Rwanda last month
and apologized the lack of international action to prevent the 1994
ethnic slaughter in that former Belgian colony.
</P>
<P>
   If the parliament committee confirms the book's claims of
Belgian military involvement, Belgium is expected to issue an
official apology for Lumumba's killing. Kabila has already said he
would forgive the culprits if they ask forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium held sway over Congo for some 80 years with a
ruthlessness that became proverbial and was highlighted in Joseph
Conrad's book ''Heart of Darkness,'' a fictional story that touches
on colonial exploitation.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Urges Squatters To Move  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico appealed to squatters in a sensitive
jungle reserve on Tuesday to move away from the area, where their
slash-and-burn farming has contributed to a rash of brush fires
that could create a major environmental disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups demanded that the government fight the fires
without antagonizing the largely Indian squatters, especially given
the reserve's location in the rebellion-torn southern state of
Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   The current dry season threatens to fan the isolated brush fires
at the Montes Azules reserve into the kind of blaze that devastated
another reserve, Chimapalas, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Montes Azules -- or ''Blue Mountains'' -- reserve is part of
the last remaining patches of the Lacandon rainforest that once
covered western Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   ''These fires are intentionally set in most cases, and, added to
the deforestation and squatters' settlements in the Lacandon
Jungle, are endangering one of Mexico's unique ecosystems,'' the
environmentalist Group of 100 wrote in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Environment Secretariat has requested help from federal
police to evict, or relocate, the 17 squatters camps that have
sprung up in the reserve. The squatters are mainly Indians, and
support runs high in the area for the leftist Zapatista rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The Group of 100 agreed the fires must be fought, but stopped
short of calling for the eviction of the squatters. The group
warned against making the problem a political issue, and asked that
human rights observers accompany firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The historical ethnocide (of Indians) cannot justify an
'eco-cide' that would make history, because the first victims of
such destruction would be the Indians themselves,'' the group said.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry, which oversees domestic security, was
quick to promise it would not attempt a military-style raid on the
camps, or use the problem as a pretext to weaken the rebel
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry said in a statement Tuesday it was trying to
negotiate with the squatters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The negotiations have two goals: to offer better places (for
the settlers), and to protect the nature reserve,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lacandon reserve, which includes rain forest, is located in
Chiapas state near the Guatemalan border, near where the Zapatistas
staged a brief armed uprising in 1994 to demand greater democracy
and Indian rights.

<HEADLINE> Device Could Help Avalanche Victims  </HEADLINE>
By HANNAH WOLFSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Buried avalanche victims may be able to
survive much longer if they use a special commercial breathing
device, according to an article in Wednesday's edition of the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Test subjects stayed conscious and alert for an average of 58
minutes when they breathed through the AvaLung -- a lightweight vest
with a built-in air pocket and breathing tube -- but only 10 minutes
without it.
</P>
<P>
   Those extra minutes could provide the time needed to save lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Essentially, after 30 minutes, the majority of people buried
are found dead,'' said Dr. Colin K. Grissom, the study's lead
author. ''So the benefit of an AvaLung is to give rescuers more
time to dig someone out.''
</P>
<P>
   During the winter of 1998-1999, the same period the study was
conducted, about 50 people died in avalanches in the United States
and 150 in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Although 25 percent of avalanches deaths are due to trauma, most
victims asphyxiate. The chance of death increases dramatically as
the minutes tick by: 92 percent of victims rescued within 15
minutes survive, but after 35 minutes only 30 percent make it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most densely packed snow has oxygen in it, a fact that
drove Colorado psychiatrist Thomas Crowley to develop a prototype
after a friend was killed skiing. He then pitched his system to
Black Diamond, a small Salt Lake City company that makes climbing
and backcountry ski gear.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've averaged one fatality a year at Black Diamond due to
avalanches -- employees, friends of ours, or former employees,''
said Black Diamond CEO Peter Metcalf. ''This touches close to
home.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech vest, which retails at $198 in its basic version,
is worn over clothing and has a pop-up breathing tube in the
collar.
</P>
<P>
   Inhale through the mouthpiece and the mesh front of the vest
acts as an air filter, drawing oxygen from the snow without forming
a deadly ice mask that can block breathing altogether. Breathe out,
and carbon dioxide exits the tube near the shoulder blade, limiting
the amount inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   Don Bachman, executive director of the American Association of
Avalanche Professionals, said he thinks the AvaLung is an important
addition to the arsenal of avalanche safety devices. But it's not a
cure-all.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm still skeptical about its value on the mass market because
of the tendency for people to trust technology rather than good
judgment,'' Bachman said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Music executive Clive Davis, who helped launch
the careers of pop stars like Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen, has
lost a power struggle over his future at Arista Records, the
company he founded 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   BMG Entertainment, a division of German media conglomerate
Bertelsmann, announced Tuesday that Antonio ''L.A.'' Reid will take
Davis' spot as head of Arista on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''Antonio brings to Arista an inspired track record as a
businessman, Grammy award-winning producer and deeply committed
record man,'' said Strauss Zelnick, chief executive of BMG
Entertainment, which owns Arista.
</P>
<P>
   The move ends a six-month feud between Davis, 66, and his
corporate bosses. Bertelsmann traditionally enforces a retirement
age of 60 on its top executives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Though I regret the imposition of the Bertelsmann retirement
age policy, it's time now to turn to a new and vital chapter in
this fast changing world of music,'' Davis said in a statement. A
publicist, Howard Rubenstein, said Davis is weighing offers from
BMG and others to create a new company.
</P>
<P>
   BMG had been grooming Reid, an executive with LaFace Records and
an accomplished record producer with partner Babyface, as a
potential successor and sent him to Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   At Arista, Davis presided over a pop empire that includes
Whitney Houston, Sarah McLachlan, Sean ''Puffy'' Combs, Aretha
Franklin, Monica and Deborah Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' career began at CBS Records in the 1960s, signing artists
like Janis Joplin, Billy Joel and Springsteen. He was fired in 1973
when the label accused him of mismanaging funds, but he quickly
founded Arista, which has been a haven for artists mostly in the
pop and rhythm 'n' blues fields. Arista was sold to Bertelsmann in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many music executives who concern themselves strictly
with business, Davis often took an active role in molding artists
by producing albums and picking the songs they record.

Rebels Say Two Hostages Die in Clash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TALIPAO, Philippines (AP) -- Rebels said two foreign hostages died in a clash
early Wednesday between military troops and Muslim guerrillas holding 21 people
in the southern Philippines. But military officials said they had no knowledge
of any fatalities among the hostages kidnapped from a Malasian resort.
Meanwhile, the same rebel group holding another group of 27 Filipino hostages in
neighboring Basilan province offered Wednesday to release all their captives if
the military halts its pursuit.

   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Protesters on Vieques island that serves as the

over bombing of the island. The protesters who have blocked bombing on Vieques
island for over a year say that federal agents would have to arrest them to
clear the range but promised they wouldn't fight back. With three U.S. warships
offshore, the occupiers readied for what they called ''the invasion,'' a

Ky. Launching Anti-Smoking Campaign

   FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- Kentucky, the No. 1 state in smoking and No. 2 in
tobacco growing, is launching its first statewide kick-the-habit campaign, with
a modest goal to start with. The state's top public health official would like
Kentucky to fall to No. 2 in its smoking rate. ''If we can make it to No. 2, we
can probably make it to No. 5 or No. 8,'' Dr. Rice Leach, public health
commissioner, said today. ''If we can do that, we're on our way to getting
somewhere in the middle of the pack.''

Fortier's Lawyer Criticizes Judge
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A judge who resentenced Michael Fortier to 12 years in prison
in the Oklahoma bombing case was acting vindictively because the first sentence
he handed down was thrown out, according to Fortier's lawyer. In a brief filed
today with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, lawyer Michael G. McGuire of
Tulsa, Okla., argued that U.S. District Judge Thomas Van Bebber of Kansas City
showed ''a deliberate effort to achieve a punitive level'' by sentencing Fortier
to 12 years for a second time. Fortier appealed the initial sentence and the
appeals court in Denver sent the case back to Van Bebber, saying he mistakenly
used guidelines for first-degree murder rather than manslaughter.

AT&AMP;T Stock Down Over Profit Warning

   NEW YORK (AP) -- AT&AMP;T's stock slid 14 percent today as the company issued its

about whether his radical remake of the nation's largest long-distance company
will succeed. AT&AMP;T fell $7.12{ per share to $41.87{. The disappointing forecast,

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Pledge Called Inadequate  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A coalition of countries said Tuesday that
a new pledge by the key five nuclear powers to work to eliminate
their nuclear arsenals falls short of demands that they actually
get rid of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We stress that the total elimination of nuclear weapons is an
obligation and a priority and not an ultimate goal,'' said a
statement by Mexico, Ireland, South Africa, Egypt, Sweden, New
Zealand and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was a response to a joint position paper issued
Monday in which the United States, Russia, China, France and
Britain pledged their ''unequivocal commitment to the ultimate
goals of complete elimination of nuclear disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   Both documents were circulated at the a conference reviewing the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which obliges countries without
nuclear arms to forgo obtaining them while the five powers pursue
nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear weapon states are under fire at the conference for
having failed to pursue good-faith negotiations to actually get rid
of their nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the pledge by the five powers Monday merely restated
the commitments they made when they signed the treaty -- promises
that haven't been met for the 30 years that the treaty has been in
force.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition of seven countries in the New Agenda Coalition has
called for the nuclear weapon states to actually take steps to
achieve nuclear disarmament -- not just pursue it -- over the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Tuesday, the coalition said the pledge by the
nuclear powers ''falls short of our expectations regarding nuclear
disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   While saying they appreciated the forward-looking approach of
the nuclear powers, the coalition members repeated their demands
for the five to start an accelerated process of negotiations by
2005.
</P>
<P>
   The statement issued Monday by the nuclear powers only covered
the first five nuclear powers, not India and Pakistan, which
exploded nuclear devices in 1998 or Israel, which is believed to
have nuclear capabilities.

<HEADLINE> LPGA Votes Rankin Into Hall of Fame  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON, AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judy Rankin, a 26-time winner and the first woman to break the
$100,000 barrier, was voted into the LPGA Tour Hall of Fame on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rankin was the first player elected from the tour's new
Veteran's Category, which was established in February 1999 when the
LPGA revamped its rigid Hall of Fame criteria.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judy Rankin represents all that is good about the LPGA and the
game of golf,'' LPGA commissioner Ty Votaw said. ''Judy's skill on
the golf course, coupled with her commitment to the tour, has
contributed greatly to the LPGA's success over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Rankin was twice the player of the year, a three-time winner of
the Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average and set an LPGA record
with 25 finishes in the top 10 in 1977. Six years later, at age 38,
she was forced into retirement by back problems.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she remained deeply involved in golf, as an analyst for
ABC Sports and ESPN, and as captain of the U.S. team that won the
Solheim Cup in 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rankin will be inducted Nov. 20 at the World Golf Hall of Fame
along with Beth Daniel and Juli Inkster. The PGA Tour is expected
to announce the results of its Veteran's Committee and Lifetime
Achievement category later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Rankin, 55, will become the 18th member of the LPGA Hall of
Fame. She was in New Orleans, where ABC and ESPN are broadcasting
the Compaq Classic on the PGA Tour, and not immediately available
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Rankin never dreamed she could be part of the Hall of Fame when
she retired from competition in 1983. The LPGA had the toughest
standards in sports, requiring least 30 victories and two major
championship, 35 wins and one major or 40 wins and no majors.
</P>
<P>
   She failed to win a major in her 22-year career, although she
won the Peter Jackson Classic in Canada two years before it was
designated a major.
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA voted last year to change its criteria, setting a
standard of 27 points in which one point was awarded for a victory,
two for a major, and one point each for player of the year or a
Vare Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Under that system, Rankin would have qualified easily, with 33
points. But the LPGA also established a Veteran's Category, and the
12-member committee that nominates one player each year selected
Rankin in March.
</P>
<P>
   Nominees must receive 75 percent of the vote from the LPGA
tournament division.
</P>
<P>
   Players voted at a meeting in Austin, Texas, site of this week's
Phillips Invitational. Those not in the field had to get their
ballots to LPGA headquarters Monday. LPGA spokeswoman Connie Wilson
said Rankin's vote was near unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Rankin, who grew up in St. Louis, won the 1959 Missouri Women's
Amateur as a 14-year-old and joined the LPGA three years later. She
won her first event in 1968, the Corpus Christi Open, and won at
least once every season in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Her best year was 1976, when she became the first woman to earn
more than $100,000 in a year by winning seven times and $150,724. A
year later, she won five times and set the record for top-10
finishes.
</P>
<P>
   A former LPGA president, Rankin was awarded the tour's William
and Mousie Powell Award in 1998 by the players for having the
ideals of the LPGA.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, she was honored for her contributions to golf with
the Patty Berg Award by the LPGA and the William H. Richardson
Award by the Golf Writers Association of America. She also received
the First Lady of Golf award from the PGA of America.

<HEADLINE> Reds 7, Phillies 0  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Denny Neagle allowed one hit in six innings,
and Sean Casey hit a two-run homer as the Cincinnati Reds beat the
Philadelphia Phillies 7-0 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle (3-0) allowed a leadoff double to Doug Glanville and
didn't give up another hit. He struck out five and walked four
while extending his scoreless innings streak to 18.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia has lost four straight and 14 of 17.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle allowed two hits in seven innings in a 12-1 victory over
the New York Mets in his last start on April 26. Scott Sullivan
allowed one hit in the final three innings for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Casey hit a two-run homer in the second and Pokey Reese had two
RBIs to lead the Reds to their third straight victory and fifth in
six games.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Ashby (1-3) struggled for the second straight outing,
allowing six runs -- five earned -- in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies got just one runner to third base. Neagle retired
nine straight and 11 of 12 at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. went 0-for-4 in his first game in Philadelphia.
Griffey got a little flavor of the Philly fans with two outs in the
fifth when a fan ran out to center-field, well ahead of the
security officers. The man shook Griffey's hand and did a dance
before falling to his knees and surrendering.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds took a 1-0 lead in the second when Reese lined a single
off the left-field wall to score Gookie Dawkins. Casey followed
with a two-run homer to right-center to make it 3-0. It was the
first homer of the season for Casey, who hit 25 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds put the game away with three runs in the sixth. Eddie
Taubensee, Aaron Boone and Dawkins hit successive singles to make
it 4-0. A sacrifice fly by Reese made it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Dawkins then scored from second as Casey reached first on a
throwing error by Mickey Morandini, giving the Reds a 6-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Phillies, who entered the game with a major
league-leading .990 fielding percentage, committed three of their
12 errors Tuesday. ... Reese, who won the NL Gold Glove last
season, committed his fourth error at second base. ... Injured
closer Mike Jackson, out with a strained right shoulder, threw
Tuesday for the first time since April 18. He reported some pain in
his shoulder, but said he was encouraged by the outing. ''The true
test will come when I throw off the mound,'' Jackson said. ...
Injured reliever Jeff Brantley pitched one inning at Triple-A
Scranton Wilkes-Barre. He allowed two runs and one hit. Brantley is
scheduled to pitch again Wednesday. ... Ashby had a career ERA of
2.98 in March and April before posting a 5.17 ERA this April.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 7, Angels 6  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Mike Bordick singled in the winning run in the
ninth inning as the Baltimore Orioles rallied to beat Troy Percival
and the Anaheim Angels 7-6 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore blew a 5-0 lead, then came back to score twice in the
ninth without making an out.
</P>
<P>
   With the Orioles trailing 6-5, Jeff Conine led off with a walk
off Percival (0-2) and Cal Ripken followed with an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   After an intentional walk to pinch-hitter Harold Baines, Charles
Johnson singled to load the bases. Anaheim then used five
infielders, but Bordick foiled the strategy with an opposite-field
liner to right.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback prevented unbeaten Scott Schoeneweis from getting
his fifth victory. The left-hander gave up five runs and six hits
in 7 2-3 innings and left with a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Trombley (2-1) worked the ninth for the Orioles, who had
been 0-7 when trailing after eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Down 5-0, Anaheim finally broke through against Sidney Ponson in
the sixth. After Bengie Molina hit a two-run, two-out single, the
uprising ended when left fielder B. J. Surhoff made a diving catch
of a liner by pinch-hitter Orlando Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   But Surhoff dropped a fly ball by Adam Kennedy in the seventh,
and two batters later Tim Salmon connected with two on to make it
5-5. Surhoff's error was his first since July 18, 1998, ending a
string of 250 errorless games.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Troy Glaus hit a 406-foot shot to left to give
the Angels their only lead.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis left in the eighth despite having retired seven
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore took a 1-0 lead in the third when Will Clark led off
with a double and scored on a two-out single by Brady Anderson.
Clark strained his left hamstring running toward the plate and left
the game.
</P>
<P>
   An RBI double by Conine and a run-scoring grounder by Ripken
made it 3-0 in the fourth. An error and Anderson's third home run
of the season, a 396-foot drive to center, put Baltimore up 5-0 in
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Salmon hit his 200th career double. He ranks third on the
Angels' career list. ... Baltimore's Delino DeShields recorded his
team-high 10th steal. He had 11 last year. ... Glaus' steal in the
fourth was the Angels' 25th. They didn't reach 25 last year until
the 68th game. ... Clark has reached base in 43 of 82 plate
appearances. ... Anaheim SS Gary DiSarcina left in the sixth
because of tightness in his right shoulder.

<HEADLINE> Congress Wraps Up Africa Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate negotiators are wrapping up
work on a major trade bill aimed at opening up new trading
opportunities with sub-Saharan Africa, Central America and the
Caribbean, congressional aides said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said the compromise
legislation could reach the House floor as early as this week,
where it is expected to pass easily.
</P>
<P>
   The trade initiative has been under consideration for several
years and would be a major accomplishment for advocates of open
markets, topped this year only by a vote later this month on
putting U.S.-Chinese trade relations on a permanent status.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a statement, said he was pleased that
Congress ''appears to have reached agreement on this historic
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a win for the United States and a win for our friends in
Africa and the Caribbean Basin. I urge Congress to move as quickly
as possible to a final vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has been deadlocked in a House-Senate conference since
last year, when the House passed a bill that extended duty-free
benefits to African nations and the Senate moved legislation that
opened up trade with both African and Caribbean nations.
</P>
<P>
   The general compromise includes the Caribbean and Central
American nations in the trade initiative. Responding to the
concerns of senators from North and South Carolina that the bill
would cost American textile industry jobs, it also puts a cap on
the volume of apparel shipments to receive duty free treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Imports of African apparel made from regional fabric would be
limited for eight years, although the poorest African nations would
be able to export apparel made from third-country fabric for the
first four years.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators announced two weeks ago that they had a
tentative agreement, but coming up with a final version proved
difficult as lawmakers sought to add new language on such issues as
helping African nations get AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., earlier Tuesday
urged lawmakers to stop trying to tinker with the legislation.
''Let me just put it real blunt, point blank. You know, there are
other people that need to quit being obstinate and bring this to a
conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 434.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turk Officials Meet Albright  </HEADLINE>
By DAFNA LINZER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Three weeks before the United Nations convenes
another round of talks on the future of Cyprus talks, the Greek and
Turkish foreign ministers met Tuesday with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to discuss the divided Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met separately and jointly with George Papandreou of
Greece and Ismail Cem of Turkey at the Waldorf Astoria hotel after
attending a daylong seminar on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials provided no details of the talks,
saying only that the three discussed the Cyprus dispute and
regional issues relating to the Balkans and economic reform in both
Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus has been divided into a Turkish north and Greek south
since a Turkish invasion in 1974, which came in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup by supporters of union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
   A breakaway Turkish Cypriot state declared in 1983 in the north
is only recognized by Turkey, which maintains 35,000 troops there.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has mediated two rounds of indirect talks
between Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash and is hosting a third round at U.N.
headquarters beginning May 23.
</P>
<P>
   The talks have deadlocked so far over Denktash's insistence on
the recognition of the breakaway state in the north as a
precondition for substantive face to face negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Papandreou, Cem, Albright and Javier Solana, the European
Union's foreign policy chief, opened the day by addressing a forum
on the Balkans at the East West Institute, a European-American
nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks to the forum, Albright took a swipe at Congress'
slashing of funds for American foreign policy, saying U.S. payments
for the enormous U.N. mission running Kosovo were being withheld.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is irresponsible,'' Albright told the forum. ''The 21st
century is no time to retreat. Congress should appropriate the
funds the president has requested.''

<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Deliberations in former Gov. Edwin
Edwards' federal racketeering trial were halted after six days
Tuesday while the judge interviewed each of the 12 jurors.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola would not say what his
inquiry involved but said attorneys were to report to court early
Wednesday morning to finish discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ''No decision has been made on the matter before the court,''
Polozola said in an open court hearing Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors did not deliberate all day, he said. Polozola said
the jurors would report to court an hour later than usual
Wednesday, at 9 a.m., and may begin deliberating then.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, his son, Stephen, State Sen. Greg Tarver and four
others are accused in a series of extortion schemes to manipulate
the licensing of Louisiana riverboat casinos from 1991 through
1997. If convicted on all counts, Edwards, 72, faces more than 300
years in prison. Deliberations began April 24.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday began with attorneys and defendants meeting privately
for about an hour in the judge's chambers. Polozola then called
everyone into court, where he revealed that he was going to conduct
an inquiry and that the jurors were not deliberating.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys, defendants and the judge remained locked up in
the courtroom for more than 10 hours before the judge unlocked the
door to tell reporters that the issue the court faced had to be
dealt with outside the presence of the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court has interviewed each juror and has just completed
the process -- all 12 jurors,'' Polozola said.
</P>
<P>
   During breaks from the marathon session with the judge,
attorneys refused to discuss what was taking place in the
courtroom.

<HEADLINE> RNC 'Census' Did Not Violate Rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Postal Service has ruled that a Republican
National Committee fund-raising mailing sent to members, which
included a GOP-specific census form, did not violate federal postal
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The six-page RNC mailing had been criticized by Democrats as
looking too much like a Census Bureau document. Last week, Rep.
Carolyn Maloney of New York, senior Democrat on the House
Government Committee's census panel, said the mailing trivialized
the Census Bureau's current efforts to count the population and
asked the Postal Service to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The RNC mailing is ''not actionable,'' Postal Service inspector
Daniel Mihalko said Tuesday. It is not a ''government look-alike
mailing.''
</P>
<P>
   The mailing came in an enveloped emblazoned with the phrase
''REPUBLICAN CENSUS DOCUMENT ENCLOSED.'' The first page of the
cover letter is written on Republican National Committee
letterhead, and the bottom of the page has the phrase ''Not printed
at taxpayers' expense. Paid for by the RNC.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're elated that Congresswoman Maloney closely reads her mail
and now hope she ends her partisan sniping once and for all,'' said
RNC spokesman Mark Pfeifle.
</P>
<P>
   However, Maloney said, ''It may not be illegal but it certainly
is a cheap stunt that hurts the census.''

<HEADLINE> Yankees 4, Indians 2  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Andy Pettitte didn't have any trouble with his
back or the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte got his first win of the season by holding Cleveland to
one run -- a bases-loaded walk -- and three singles in six-plus
innings Tuesday night, leading the New York Yankees to a 4-2 win
over the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson Delgado started at second base for the injured Chuck
Knoblauch and got his first two RBIs in the AL, and Ricky Ledee
homered for the first time this year as the Yankees improved to
31-15 against Cleveland since the start of the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte (1-1) was making just his third start of the season and
second since returning from the disabled list with a strained back
muscle. The left-hander didn't give up a hit until the fifth when
he wriggled out of a potentially dangerous jam.
</P>
<P>
   Once Pettitte left, New York's bullpen finished the job again.
Jeff Nelson pitched two innings and Mariano Rivera, who barely
closed out Monday's 2-1 win, allowed an RBI single to David Justice
before finishing for his league-leading ninth save.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera struck out Enrique Wilson with two runners on to end the
game.
</P>
<P>
   In its last 11 games, New York's bullpen has allowed only six
runs in the 34 1-3 innings -- a 1.57 ERA. The Yankees' relievers
went 7-0 in April, becoming the first bullpen in history to go
undefeated in the month.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Witt (0-1) took the loss, allowing eight hits in four-plus
innings.
</P>
<P>
   New York manager Joe Torre's decision to sit Knoblauch, who has
a sprained left hand, gave Delgado a chance to start at second and
it put Ledee, who came in batting .170, in the leadoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado's two-run double put the Yankees up 3-0 in the fifth and
Ledee hit his first homer since Sept. 27 in the seventh to put the
Yankees ahead 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Indians dropped their third straight and
continued team-wide hitting woes.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, which entered the game ranked 12th in the AL in
hitting, is batting .205 and scored 11 runs in its last five games.
This from a team that scored more than 1,000 runs in '99.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Vizquel, Roberto Alomar and Manny Ramirez, all of whom
batted over .323 last season, are a combined 7-for-58 (.121) with
three runs and two RBIs in the homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte was in a groove from the start, retiring the first 12
in a row -- 10 on grounders -- and didn't give up a hit until Manny
Ramirez led off the fifth by grounding a single to center.
</P>
<P>
   After striking out Jim Thome, Pettitte walked Travis Fryman and
Richie Sexson followed with a single to load the bases. Sexson's
hit snapped the Indians' 0-for-21 streak with runners in scoring
position in their last five games.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Ramirez drew a walk to force in a run, but as has been the
case during much of the early season, the Indians failed to get a
clutch hit.
</P>
<P>
   Einar Diaz popped out in foul territory for the second out and
Jolbert Cabrera flied to center, letting Pettitte escape.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams hit his seventh homer in the fourth to make it
1-0, and the Yankees added two runs in the fifth on Delgado's first
extra-base hit of the season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Knoblauch will have further tests this week to determine
the extent of his injury. Torre said there is a possibility
Knoblauch could go on the DL for the first time in his career. ...
The Yankees are 10-0 when holding an opponent to three or fewer
runs. ... 1B Tino Martinez made the first nine putouts and 11 of
the first 12 when Pettitte didn't let the Indians hit the ball out
of the infield. ... Diaz has thrown out five of the last six
potential basestealers and 7 of 15 this season. ... Witt has lost a
career-high eight straight decisions.

<HEADLINE> Dems Hold NY County Legislature  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Democrats in the Long Island
suburbs held onto their control of the Nassau County legislature
Tuesday when a 29-year-old bankruptcy lawyer won a special election
to succeed his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have held a solid lock on the county since World War
I, but lost it last year after a series of fiscal problems and a
last-minute property tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   But the death of Barbara Johnson from breast cancer in March
gave Republicans another chance. The race in one of the nation's
richest counties was being watched as a possible harbinger for the
November presidential and Senate elections.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's son, Scott, won with 6,774 votes, or 58 percent of the
vote in the tiny legislative district mostly on the island's North
Shore. He beat Republican Linda H. Green, an assistant principal in
Queens and the former town clerk in North Hempstead, who drew 2,650
votes, or 23 percent. Green Party candidate Ben Zwirn, a former
North Hempstead town supervisor, drew 2,278 votes, or 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Helping in the campaign for the lone seat on the 19-member
Legislature were Republicans Rudy Giuliani and Sen. John McCain,
and Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer.

<HEADLINE> Padres' Williams Has Aneurysm  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Padres starting pitcher Woody
Williams has an aneurysm under his right armpit and doctors will
recommend surgery, another huge setback for a staff already
besieged by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The aneurysm was discovered during an angiogram on Tuesday
morning, the day after Williams pitched 8 1-3 innings in a 5-2 loss
to the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had reported numbness in his throwing hand for the last
five of his six starts this year, and trainer Todd Hutcheson said a
blood clot broke off the aneurysm at some point and caused
Williams' ring finger to turn white and cold the last couple
starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres say Williams' condition is similar to that of New
York Yankees pitcher David Cone, who had surgery to repair an
aneurysm in his right shoulder in 1996. Cone missed four months,
but no-hit Oakland for seven innings in his first start back.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jan Fronek said having surgery will be up to Williams, but
doctors will recommend that he have it. If a non-surgical treatment
is used, the same problem may return, Fronek said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams underwent tests during the weekend that showed he had
good circulation through his hand. He wasn't in danger when he
pitched Monday night, Hutcheson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The risk, according to what our doctors told us, was
relatively low,'' Hutcheson said. ''Woody wanted to pitch and he
went out there and we just kept a close eye throughout the game and
his symptoms last night were about like they had been the start
before.''
</P>
<P>
   When the earlier tests didn't explain Williams' symptoms,
doctors were concerned that he had a problem with a blood vessel
closer to his shoulder, so they did the angiogram, Fronek said.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres started the season with four pitchers on the disabled
list, and haven't gotten any of them back yet.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Carlton Loewer fell out of a hunting blind and broke his
left ankle in January, setup man Steve Montgomery remains sidelined
by a strained right shoulder, reliever Rodney Myers has a partially
torn right rotator cuff that wasn't diagnoses until after he had
been obtained in a trade with the Chicago Cubs, and reliever Randy
Myers is still sidelined after undergoing rotator cuff surgery last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Myers could be back by Friday, but he will eventually
require surgery. Starter Brian Boehringer is on the DL with a
strain in his right shoulder, which was surgically repaired last
year, and setup man Donne Wall is just getting over tendinitis and
can't pitch on consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   ''When injuries happen to your pitching staff, it's tougher,''
manager Bruce Bochy said. ''It's hard to replace. There's just not
that much good pitching going around. And now you're trying to
replace a couple of starters and your setup man. It's started to
come back and haunt us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres will hang onto rookie Rodrigo Lopez, who had been
scheduled to go back to Triple-A Las Vegas after his spectacular
start against Atlanta on Saturday night. Because of days off
Thursday and Monday, the Padres won't need a fifth starter until
May 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres expect to have center fielder Ruben Rivera back in
time to face Randy Johnson and the Arizona Diamondbacks on Friday
in Phoenix. Rivera has been on the disabled list since April 12
with a condition that Hutcheson calls reactive arthritis apparently
was triggered by an inflammation that attacked injuries in his left
wrist and right ankle.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 8, Devil Rays 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Rick Helling didn't allow a hit
until the sixth inning and Rafael Palmeiro had a homer and three
RBIs Tuesday night as the Texas Rangers beat the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays 8-1.
</P>
<P>
   Despite control problems, Helling (3-1) kept the Devil Rays
hitless until Fred McGriff lined a one-out single to right on the
right-hander's 104th pitch of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Helling allowed just the one unearned run and one hit in 7 1-3
innings, struck out six, walked six and hit a batter. He is 5-1
against Tampa Bay, including 4-0 at Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Venafro retired one batter in the eighth, and Tim Crabtree
finished the two-hitter, allowing a ninth-inning single to Steve
Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez hit a solo homer in the ninth inning, his 10th of
the season and third in two games.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who went 2-for-2 with two walks, returned to the
starting lineup for the first time since straining his left
hamstring Friday. He hit a second-inning solo homer and added a
two-run single in the sixth that made it 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis hit a fifth-inning solo shot, and David Segui, Ruben
Mateo and Jason McDonald had RBI singles in a three-run eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Texas won for the ninth time in 12 games at Tropicana Field,
where the Rangers went 6-0 last last season.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro was not inserted into the lineup until after batting
practice. He needed just three pitches to make his presence felt,
sending a 1-1 pitch from Ryan Rupe (0-4) into the right-field
stands.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's homer was his ninth this season and the 370th of his
career, moving him past Ralph Kiner into a tie for 46th on the
career list with Gil Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   Rupe allowed four runs and six hits in five-plus innings. He has
given up 36 runs -- 33 earned -- in 30 2-3 innings during six starts
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Devil Rays manager Larry Rothschild was ejected by plate umpire
Tony Randazzo for arguing a check-swing, third-strike call against
Gerald Williams in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Announced attendance was 15,067. Tampa Bay has drawn 15,464 or
less in five of its last seven home games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tampa Bay's Greg Vaughn became the fifth active player with
300 homers and 100 stolen bases after stealing second in the
fourth. The others are teammate Jose Canseco, Ken Griffey Jr.,
Barry Bonds and Sammy Sosa... Canseco was scratched from the
starting lineup because of right calf stiffness. He hopes to return
Friday. ... Rangers OF Gabe Kapler left in the fifth inning after
straining his right quadriceps. ... Texas hit into double plays in
five consecutive innings starting in the third. ... Royce Clayton
is 1-for-14 with three walks when leading off the Texas first
inning. He flied out starting the game.

<HEADLINE> Easley Wins NC Nomination for Gov.  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- State Attorney General Mike Easley won the
Democratic nomination on Tuesday in a bid to succeed retiring Gov.
Jim Hunt, beating back Lt. Gov. Dennis Wicker and five other
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Former Charlotte Mayor Richard Vinroot was leading in the race
for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   With 46 percent of precincts reporting, Easley had 145,639
votes, or 60 percent, to Wicker's 87,622 votes, or 36 percent.
Vinroot had 60,779 votes, or 44 percent, to state Rep. Leo
Daughtry's 25,400 votes, or 35 percent. Former state Rep. Chuck
Neely trailed with 19 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a runoff, the winning candidate in each party must get
more than 40 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, conservative Rep. David McIntosh won the GOP
nomination to challenge first-term Democratic Gov. Frank O'Bannon.
With 68 percent of precincts reporting, he had 194,881 votes, or 71
percent of the vote. He defeated John Price, a lawyer who toured
the state in a red school bus, who had 77,971 votes, or 29 percent.
O'Bannon had no opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional races in both states drew heavy competition.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout, however, appeared light in both states with the
Republican and Democratic nominees for president all but final.
George W. Bush and Al Gore already have won the necessary number of
delegates, and they won more Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, Gore drew 75 percent of the Democratic vote, while
his former rival Bill Bradley won 21 percent. Lyndon H. LaRouche
Jr. had 3 percent. Bush drew 81 percent and former rival John
McCain drew 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, Bush drew 78 percent of the GOP vote, while
former rivals John McCain drew 11 percent and Alan Keyes drew 8
percent. Gore drew 70 percent, while his former rival, Bill
Bradley, drew 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., Gore drew 95 percent of the Democratic
vote. Bush drew 73 percent, and former candidate John McCain had 24
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, North Carolina's governor from 1975 to 1983 and re-elected
to two more terms starting in 1993, is barred by state law from
seeking another term. The Democrat is one of the state's best-known
politicians, with approval ratings exceeding 70 percent. He did not
endorse any of the 13 candidates.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Wicker and Easley argued over how best to
strengthen education programs with money from a not-yet-approved
state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Vinroot and Daughtry criticized each other's conservative record
on spending and abortion, while debating whether to use attack ads.
Neely avoided most of that fight.
</P>
<P>
   Easley, a 50-year-old former state prosecutor, ran
unsuccessfully for Senate in 1990. Vinroot ran unsuccessfully for
the GOP nomination for governor in 1996. Daughtry was former
majority leader of the state House.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there were seven Democrats, four Republicans and two
Libertarians running.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to challenge Democratic Rep. Mel Watt in the fall,
history teacher Chad Mitchell led with 1,343 votes in early
returns, or 47 percent, to gourmet coffee shop owner John
Cosgrove's 1,073 votes, or 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Watt's district's lines are being challenged in federal court by
critics who allege it was drawn with an unconstitutional emphasis
on race.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, former radio talk show host Mike Pence defeated a
crowded field to win the GOP nomination to seek the seat for
McIntosh's east-central district.

<HEADLINE> Flyers 4, Penguins 3, OT  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers almost had no choice:
win the game or lose their season.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers let Jaromir Jagr's line rally Pittsburgh from a
two-goal deficit, then came back to do on the road what they
couldn't do at home by winning 4-3 on Andy Delmore's overtime goal
Tuesday night to cut the Penguins' series lead to a game.
</P>
<P>
   Delmore scored his first two career playoff goals, the second at
11:01 of overtime to overcome a brilliant game by Jagr, who had two
goals and an assist, as the road team won for the third consecutive
game.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-seeded Penguins take a 2-1 lead into Game 4 of the
Eastern Conference semifinals Thursday, but squandered a chance to
virtually wrap up the series by allowing the Flyers to dominate the
overtime. The top-seeded Flyers outshot them 11-1 in the extra
session, with Delmore wristing a shot from the slot past Ron
Tugnutt off drop passes by Keith Jones, who had a goal and two
assists, and Jody Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr scored his fourth and fifth goals of the series and had a
hand in every Penguins goal as they rallied from Flyers leads of
2-0 and 3-2 before Philadelphia ended an eight-game playoff
overtime losing streak. The Flyers hadn't won a playoff overtime
game since Eric Lindros' goal beat New Jersey on June 7, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers opened a 2-0 lead in a frenetically played first
period, lost it as Jagr's line scored twice in the second period,
then regained it on John LeClair's goal at 7:27 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers are one of the NHL's best teams with a lead. But as
they already know, that means nothing when Jagr is on the ice --
and, in Game 3, that probably seemed to the Flyers like virtually
every shift.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr, who appeared to skate in an even higher gear than normal
in the second period, got open in the high slot, skillfully faked
defenseman Eric Desjardins off his skates, and wristed a shot by
Brian Boucher at 14:28 of the third for his fourth goal in two
games.
</P>
<P>
   As the sellout crowd of 17,148 threatened to lift the steel top
off Mellon Arena, the NHL's oldest arena, Flyers coach Craig Ramsay
wisely took a timeout to slow Pittsburgh's momentum, and the
Penguins never regained it.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins were 7-0 in their playoff history after opening a
2-0 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia changed its top two lines after losing the first
two games on its home ice, but it was a Pittsburgh line change that
led to their comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Penguins coach Herb Brooks replaced Josef Beranek on the top
line with Martin Straka, alongside Jan Hrdina and Jagr, and the
move paid off with a goal within 40 seconds of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Straka's shot deflected high into the air off Boucher, who lost
his balance and had grab the crossbar to stay on his skates. Jagr
jumped on the puck and missed his first rebound attempt, but lifted
up a second over Boucher's leg from along the right side of the
net.
</P>
<P>
   The same Penguins line tied it later in the second period and
again in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Jagr, double teamed in the neutral zone, somehow tapped a pass
along the right wing boards to defenseman Bob Boughner. He rammed a
cross-ice pass to Straka, who tipped it with the top of his stick
into the net at 10:23 before Boucher could react.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers, who scored only once in 73 shots in losing the first
two games at home, scored on consecutive shots by Delmore and Keith
Jones in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Delmore scored his first career playoff goal at 14:11, racing to
a puck that Tugnutt deflected to the blue line to ram in a shot
from the high slot as Valeri Zelepukin backed into the goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Delmore's goal gave the Flyers their first lead of the series,
and they didn't need long to add to it. Penguins forward Alexei
Kovalev gave the puck away in the neutral zone, allowing Keith
Jones to power a shot from the edge of the right circle inside the
far post.

<P>
   VARNER, Ark. (AP) -- A former nurse who asked for the death penalty for
drugging and suffocating her two children was executed by injection today in
Arkansas' first execution of a woman in more than 150 years. Christina Marie
Riggs, 28, was the fifth woman executed in the United States since the Supreme
Court lifted a ban on capital punishment in 1976. She had maintained throughout
that she wanted to die and her last words reflected her grief. She had withdrawn
all appeals and chose not to seek clemency from Gov. Mike Huckabee.

   TALIPAO, Philippines (AP) -- Two foreign hostages died early Wednesday when
military troops and their Muslim rebel captors clashed in the Southern
Philippines. But military officials said they had no knowledge of any fatalities
among the hostages kidnapped from a Malasian resort. Meanwhile, the same rebel
group holding another group of 27 Filipino hostages in neighboring Basilan
province offered Wednesday to release all their captives if the military halts
its pursuit.

Nuclear Pledge Called Inadequate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A coalition of countries said today that a new pledge
by the key five nuclear powers to work to eliminate their nuclear arsenals falls
short of demands that they actually get rid of them. ''We stress that the total
elimination of nuclear weapons is an obligation and a priority and not an
ultimate goal,'' said a statement by Mexico, Ireland, South Africa, Egypt,
Sweden, New Zealand and Brazil. The statement was a response to a joint position
paper issued Monday in which the United States, Russia, China, France and
Britain pledged their ''unequivocal commitment to the ultimate goals of complete
elimination of nuclear disarmament.''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. economy is set to grow well into the second half of

provided fresh evidence in a third report that rising interest rates have done
little to dissuade new-home buyers. Analysts said the figures pointed to further
interest rate increases by inflation fighters at the Federal Reserve. The Index
of Leading Economic Indicators, which is designed to predict economic activity

<HEADLINE> Vinroot Wins GOP N.C. Nomination  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS PATTERSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Former Charlotte Mayor Richard Vinroot won
the GOP gubernatorial nomination Tuesday, setting up a fall race
with Democatic state Attorney General Mike Easley in their bids to
succeed Gov. Jim Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   With 74 percent of precincts reporting, Vinroot had 104,153
votes, or 45 percent, to defeat state Rep. Leo Daughtry with 84,348
votes, or 36 percent. Former state Rep. Chuck Neely had 38,601
votes, or 17 percent. Easley had 241,614 votes, or 60 percent, to
Wicker's 140,222 votes, or 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a runoff, the winning candidate in each party had to
get more than 40 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, conservative Rep. David McIntosh won the GOP
nomination to challenge first-term Democratic Gov. Frank O'Bannon.
With 74 percent of precincts reporting, he had 218,918 votes, or 72
percent of the vote. He defeated John Price, a lawyer who toured
the state in a red school bus, who had 86,043 votes, or 28 percent.
O'Bannon had no opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional races in both states drew heavy competition.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout, however, appeared light in both states with the
Republican and Democratic nominees for president all but final.
George W. Bush and Al Gore already have won the necessary number of
delegates, and they won more Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, Gore drew 75 percent of the Democratic vote, while
his former rival Bill Bradley won 21 percent. Lyndon H. LaRouche
Jr. had 3 percent. Bush drew 81 percent and former rival John
McCain drew 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, Bush drew 78 percent of the GOP vote, while
former rivals John McCain drew 11 percent and Alan Keyes drew 8
percent. Gore drew 70 percent, while his former rival, Bill
Bradley, drew 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., Gore drew 95 percent of the Democratic
vote. Bush drew 73 percent, and former candidate John McCain had 24
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, North Carolina's governor from 1975 to 1983 and re-elected
to two more terms starting in 1993, is barred by state law from
seeking another term. The Democrat is one of the state's best-known
politicians, with approval ratings exceeding 70 percent. He did not
endorse any of the 13 candidates.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Wicker and Easley argued over how best to
strengthen education programs with money from a not-yet-approved
state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Vinroot and Daughtry criticized each other's conservative record
on spending and abortion, while debating whether to use attack ads.
Neely avoided most of that fight.
</P>
<P>
   Easley, a 50-year-old former state prosecutor, ran
unsuccessfully for Senate in 1990. Vinroot ran unsuccessfully for
the GOP nomination for governor in 1996. Daughtry was former
majority leader of the state House.
</P>
<P>
   In all, there were seven Democrats, four Republicans and two
Libertarians running.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to challenge Democratic Rep. Mel Watt in the fall,
history teacher Chad Mitchell led with 1,343 votes in early
returns, or 47 percent, to gourmet coffee shop owner John
Cosgrove's 1,073 votes, or 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Watt's district's lines are being challenged in federal court by
critics who allege it was drawn with an unconstitutional emphasis
on race.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, former radio talk show host Mike Pence defeated a
crowded field to win the GOP nomination to seek the seat for
McIntosh's east-central district.

<HEADLINE> Dominican Party Shows Bullet Holes  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNAH NESMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- Dominican Revolutionary
Party officials showed reporters bullet holes in a car Tuesday that
they said support their claim of an assassination attempt on their
presidential candidate at a campaign rally where two men were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition party officials said the car was carrying
Hipolito Mejia at a campaign Saturday in Moca, about 90 miles
outside Santo Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting broke out at the event and two members of the governing
Dominican Liberation Party were killed. Revolutionary Party
officials said Mejia's guards returned fire when someone shot at
the candidate's car, but the governing party said the Revolutionary
Party began shooting first.
</P>
<P>
   Seven members of the Revolutionary Party were arrested Monday in
connection with the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionary Party officials said they didn't show the public
the bullet holes in the car sooner because Mejia didn't want to
''make a scandal,'' said Revolutionary Party officer Jose Alberto
Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Francisco Camilo Javier said the car had not
been turned over to police as evidence by Tuesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> French Woman Gets Yad Vashem Medal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A former school teacher who saved Jewish children
during World War II on Tuesday received the Medal of the Righteous
from Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Edmond Durand, 89, was among three living French citizens
honored for their wartime heroism at a ceremony at the French
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Ambassador Eliahu Ben Elissar presented the medals to
Durand, Raymonde Fanouillaire and Marcelle Martin, who risked their
lives to save Jews from arrest and deportation to Nazi death camps.
Thirteen awards were presented posthumously.
</P>
<P>
   About 76,000 Jews, including 12,000 children, were deported from
France during World War II. Only about 2,500 survived.
</P>
<P>
   Fanouillaire sheltered 40 German Jewish boys at Chateau Quincy
outside Paris, where German soldiers were also billeted. Organizers
said Fanouillaire was in her seventies, but no exact age was given.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 76, provided food and clothing to two Jewish women,
Bella and Esther Kurzbatt, helping them survive in hiding at their
own home in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Durand was a young junior high school teacher in Castres,
southern France when the Nazis invaded the country. He was
approached by his principal, a member of the French Resistance, and
asked if he could find shelter for several Jewish children. He hid
them for more than eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Durand said he hoped his actions would set an example for young
people today.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I did wasn't anything special,'' he told Europe I radio.
''I did it as a human being. It was part of my Christian duty.''

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 5, Brewers 1  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Steve Finley homered twice, and Todd
Stottlemyre allowed four hits in seven innings Tuesday night to
lead the Arizona Diamondbacks over the Milwaukee Brewers 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Finley had another tremendous game at County Stadium, where he
is 10-for-18 (.556) with seven homers and 13 RBIs in his last four
games.
</P>
<P>
   Finley and Travis Lee hit consecutive homers in the fourth
inning, with Finley getting a two-run drive off Jimmy Haynes (3-2).
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre (5-1) took care of the rest, striking out five and
pitching out of a jam in the seventh. Finley also hit a solo homer
in the eighth off Ray King and tied San Francisco's Barry Bonds for
the NL home-run lead at 11. It was the 16th multihomer game of
Finley's career, his second this year.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee, shut out three times in its previous six games,
received a solo homer from Geoff Jenkins in the fourth but got only
one other runner as far as third base in the first six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The NL West-leading Diamondbacks won for the fifth time in seven
games, all on the road. Milwaukee has followed a 2-7 road trip by
losing four of its first five in a 10-game homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre is playing with a torn rotator cuff sustained early
last season. He pitched past the fifth inning for just the third
time this year, baffling the overswinging Brewers with offspeed
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee loaded the bases with one out in the seventh on a
single by Jenkins and two walks, but Stottlemyre got Henry Blanco
to ground into a double play. The chilly County Stadium crowd
didn't even bother to boo.
</P>
<P>
   Blanco was back in Milwaukee's lineup for the first time since
April 15 with a cut on his right hand that still isn't completely
healed. He still threw out Tony Womack trying to steal second in
the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes pitched well but again received no run support from the
Brewers. He allowed six hits and five walks in seven innings.
Notes: Brewers reliever Rocky Coppinger had successful ligament
replacement surgery on Tuesday in Birmingham, Ala. Coppinger
developed an inflammation in his right elbow during the first week
of March. He's finished for the season. ... The Diamondbacks'
back-to-back homers were their first since April 10. ... Mark
Loretta, who was scratched from the lineup on Tuesday night because
of a strained hamstring, is the NL's top defensive shortstop after
one month of play. He has a .991 fielding percentage, with just one
error in 109 chances. ... Jay Bell doubled home the Diamondbacks'
final run in the ninth.

<HEADLINE> Cubs 11, Astros 1  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- New elbow, same old Kerry Wood. Or close enough,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching in a major league game for the first time in almost 19
months, Wood gave up just one run -- a homer -- and three hits in six
innings Tuesday night as the Chicago Cubs routed the Houston Astros
11-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros didn't come close to touching him until Daryle Ward'
homer to right in the sixth, putting just six others on base and
getting only one past second.
</P>
<P>
   And the elbow that was surgically repaired April 8, 1999, after
he blew it out in spring training? Just fine, thank you very much.
Wood even hit the third home run of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's going to be a lot of guys on pins and needles every
time he throws,'' Cubs manager Don Baylor said before the game.
''He's one of those rare commodities you do have, and everybody's
going to be watching because he had a major injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood wasn't the same, dominating power pitcher he was the last
time he faced the Astros at Wrigley Field, when he tied a major
league record with 20 strikeouts in just his fifth career start.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 NL Rookie of the Year returned to the mound just four
days shy of the two-year anniversary of that May 6, 1998 game.
</P>
<P>
   Wood struck out four, but only one in the first four innings.
Most of his outs were on fly balls to the outfield, and he got some
help from his teammates, including a jaw-dropping, diving, backhand
catch by Sammy Sosa in the second inning. He threw one wild pitch,
walked four and sent a couple Astros jumping out of the way of
wicked inside pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't matter. Except for Ward's homer, the Astros had as
much luck against him as they did in 1998, when Wood had a 0.53 ERA
against them.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'm expecting today is, hopefully, maybe a little rust,''
Jeff Bagwell, who accounted for three of Wood's 20 strikeouts two
years ago, said before the game. ''Obviously, it's going to be very
hard for him to duplicate the 20-strikeout game. But if anybody can
do it, he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood showed he can hit the ball almost as well as he throws it,
too. He hit a two-run homer just over the left-field fence in his
first at-bat, the 11th home run allowed this year by Jose Lima
(1-5).
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs rocked Lima for four runs in the second inning, and
chased him in the fifth after five more. Lima, whose ERA swelled to
9.59, tipped his cap to the crowd as he left the field.
</P>
<P>
   While it takes most pitchers about 18 months to recover from
''Tommy John'' surgery, that hasn't tempered the expectations for
Wood. Fans can't see the scar on his right elbow, and most expect
him to come back just as scary-good as he was in 1998, when he drew
comparisons to Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   The media contingent was as big as it was for the Cubs' home
opener. Cameras followed Wood everywhere he went before the game.
When he walked out of the dugout, there were cameras. When he took
batting practice, there were cameras. And when he stretched, there
were the cameras again.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the fans were even more excited. Wood got a
standing ovation as he left the dugout before the game, but he
didn't show any reaction or do anything to indicate this game was
special. He tip-toed over the third baseline as he walked to the
mound, but he does that before every inning.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd of 38,121 cheered every warmup pitch, and
there was a huge roar when Craig Biggio fouled off the first pitch
of the game for a strike. There was another big cheer when Ken
Caminiti swung and missed for the first swinging strike.
</P>
<P>
   Wood didn't get two strikes on anyone until Mitch Meluskey, the
second batter in the second inning. And he didn't get his first
strikeout until Lima came up in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Lima went down on a called strike, and the fans cheered and
waved the ''K'' signs they've had in storage the last 19 months.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Willie Green went 4-for-4, tying his career high. It was
the first four-hit game by a Cub this season. ... Tuesday's game
was the first night game of the season at Wrigley Field. ... Mel
Gibson was the guest conductor for the seventh-inning stretch. ...
Wood's last home run was in his last regular season appearance, on
Aug. 31, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Pistons Deny Irvine Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Pistons denied a report
Tuesday that George Irvine will remain as coach next season.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN reported that Irvine, the Pistons' interim coach, would get
the job, but a team spokesman denied that.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is not the case as of right now,'' spokesman J.J. Carter
said. Team management and Irvine ''do plan to talk at some time in
the near future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN reported that the Pistons will likely sign Irvine to a two-
or three-year deal, possibly as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine was an assistant coach under Alvin Gentry and became
interim head coach when Gentry was fired March 6.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Irvine said he had no interest in having the
interim removed from his title.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been there. I've done that. And I don't have any desire
to do it anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit topped the 100-point mark in 12 of 24 games under Irvine
and posted a 14-10 record. They were 28-30 under Gentry. The
Pistons were 7-5 on the road under Irvine, after having lost 11
straight on the road before his promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Heat swept Detroit in their best-of-five first-round
playoff series. The Pistons played most of the second game and all
of the final game without All-Star forward Grant Hill after he
fractured his left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought George Irvine did a great job filling in and really
gave us a big lift down the stretch,'' reserve forward Jud Buechler
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Irvine was an assistant with the Golden State Warriors for two
years and worked for 16 years in the Indiana Pacers' front office.
He played in the ABA.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 85, Timberwolves 77  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Steve Smith got mad, then he kept the
Minnesota Timberwolves from getting even.
</P>
<P>
   Smith hit a key 3-pointer minutes after drawing a technical for
tangling with Anthony Peeler, and the Portland Trail Blazers went
on to eliminate the Wolves from the NBA playoffs with an 85-77
victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers won the best-of-five series 3-1 and advanced to face
the Utah-Seattle winner. The Jazz lead that series 2-1 with Game 4
Wednesday night in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota failed to reach the second round for the fourth
straight season.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Peeler confronted each other with 5:07 left and the
Wolves clinging to a 73-72 lead. Smith fell down after taking a
long jumper, and Peeler walked over him. The two jawed at each
other and drew double-technical fouls.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, Smith was called for a foul on Peeler, and Smith
stared him down again.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers trailed 75-74 before Smith's 3-pointer with 3:45
left, and the Wolves never regained the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Smith finished with 14 points, one fewer than Rasheed Wallace
and Arvydas Sabonis.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Garnett nearly recorded his third triple-double of the
series for Minnesota, finishing with 17 points, 10 rebounds and
nine assists.
</P>
<P>
   After Brian Grant's basket gave Portland a 79-75 lead, Terrell
Brandon's layup made it 79-77 with just under a minute left.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace banked in a jumper from the top of the circle with 32
seconds left, barely beating the buzzer and giving Portland a
four-point lead. His two free throws 12 seconds later iced it.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Anthony capped the scoring with a pair of free throws that
provided the final margin. It was the first time in eight games
between the teams this season that the final margin was bigger than
seven points.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves, who blew a 13-point lead, again got inspired
play from their reserves. This time, Bobby Jackson, who didn't play
at all in Game 3, scored 11 points, and the Wolves outscored the
Blazers by 13 points when he was in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had six points, an assist and a forced turnover in the
final six minutes of the third quarter as the Wolves broke away
from a 50-50 tie to take a 64-57 lead into the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolves were 40-4 this season when leading after three
quarters, but 0-2 in the playoffs. They also lost Game 1 after
taking a lead into the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson took a seat with the Wolves up 66-59, and by the time he
returned three minutes later, the Blazers were up 70-68, thanks to
six points from Detlef Schrempf. Jackson's quick 3-pointer gave
Minnesota a 73-72 lead, but he came out again in favor of Brandon
with the Wolves clinging to a 75-74 lead.
</P>
<P>
   And that's when Smith made his big bucket.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolves led 40-36 at halftime. They grabbed a 13-point lead
in the second quarter, the largest of the series for either team,
but their 36 percent shooting kept the Blazers in it.
</P>
<P>
   Portland closed the half on a 13-4 run.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolves, who set a franchise playoff mark by making 54
percent of their shots in Game 3 Sunday, scored just one basket in
the final 6{ minutes of the half, and their starters made just 13
of 38 shots for a 25 percent clip in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon's jumper made it 36-23 with 6:25 left in the half, but
the Wolves went from frosty to frigid, managing only Malik Sealy's
jumper and two free throws by Garnett before the break, muting the
sellout crowd of 19,006 at Target Center.
Notes: The Wolves missed 12 of their first 17 shots, yet still
managed to hold the halftime lead for the third straight game. They
trailed by a point at the break in Game 1. ... After tying an NBA
playoff record by combining for just 13 turnovers on Sunday, the
teams eclipsed that with six minutes left in the first half.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 7, Red Sox 6, 12 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Wendell Magee drove in the tying run in the
seventh inning then hit his third homer of the season in the 12th
to spoil a strong relief appearance by Tim Wakefield and give the
Detroit Tigers a 7-6 win over the Boston Red Sox on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers broke a six-game losing streak against the Red Sox
and won for only the third time in their last 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Magee entered the game as a pinch hitter for Luis Polonia in the
seventh and hit an RBI groundout that scored Rob Fick, tying the
game 6-6. Wakefield (1-2) then replaced Rheal Cormier and allowed
only two hits and no runs in the next 4 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   But with one out in the 12th, Magee homered over the left-field
wall. It was just his sixth hit of the season in 28 at bats.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Blair (1-0) pitched two scoreless innings and Todd Jones
recorded his fifth save, allowing one hit in the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Encarnacion's RBI single had given Detroit a 5-4 lead in
the sixth, Troy O'Leary's two-run homer, his fourth, put Boston
ahead 6-5 in the bottom of the inning before Magee tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rose had pitched six innings of three-hit ball in his last
start, a 10-0 shutout in Detroit on April 19. But on Tuesday, he
didn't get out of the second inning as the Tigers hit for the cycle
and batted around for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez began the four-run inning with his fourth homer,
Bobby Higginson tripled and Damion Easley doubled for a 2-0 lead. A
groundout moved Easley to third and he scored on Tony Clark's
single. Gregg Jefferies added an RBI single that made it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox tied the game in the bottom of the inning against
Mark Johnson, making his first career start. They loaded the bases
with no outs on singles by Nomar Garciaparra and O'Leary and a walk
to Carl Everett. All three scored on Jason Varitek's single when
center fielder Encarnacion's throw to third base -- while third
baseman Jefferies was halfway between the base and home plate --
went into the Detroit dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek scored the tying run on Wilton Veras' sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Gonzalez' homer was the Tigers' 13th in a row with no one
on base. Of their 24 homers, 17 have been solo shots. ...
Encarnacion extended his hitting streak to a career-best 14 games,
going 2-for-7. ... John Wasdin, who relieved Rose with one out in
the second, left the game after Polonia led off the fourth with a
hard shot off Wasdin's leg. He suffered a bruise below his left
kneecap and was taken to a hospital for X-rays. ... Everett's
nine-game hitting streak ended. ... Detroit coach Juan Samuel will
have his appeal hearing Wednesday on his 15-game suspension for his
role in a brawl April 22 with the Chicago White Sox. Samuel said it
will be conducted by Paul Beeston, the highest ranking official in
the commissioner's office besides commissioner Bud Selig. . . .
Reliever Jim Poole is appealing his $500 fine for the brawl.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Woman Executed  </HEADLINE>
By JAMIE STENGLE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VARNER, Ark. (AP) -- A former nurse who asked for the death
penalty for drugging and suffocating her two children was executed
by injection Tuesday in Arkansas' first execution of a woman in
more than 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Marie Riggs, 28, was the fifth woman executed in the
United States since the Supreme Court lifted a ban on capital
punishment in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   She had maintained throughout that she wanted to die and her
last words reflected her grief.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no way no words can express how sorry I am for taking
the lives of my babies,'' she said. ''Now I can be with my babies,
as I always intended.''
</P>
<P>
   She had withdrawn all appeals and chose not to seek clemency
from Gov. Mike Huckabee.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs told authorities that she intended to use potassium
chloride -- the same heart-stopping drug used in executions -- to
kill her children, 5-year-old Justin and 2-year-old Shelby Alexis,
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   She gave the children an antidepressant in hopes it would make
them drowsy, then injected Justin with the potassium chloride but
did not administer it properly.
</P>
<P>
   When Justin began crying, Riggs told police, she injected him
with morphine left over from a hospital patient and smothered both
children. Riggs then took 28 antidepressant tablets, intending to
commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The children were found dead in Riggs' bed. Riggs was found on
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Riggs' mother and lawyer said she suffered
post-traumatic stress after working as a nurse in the aftermath of
the Oklahoma City bombing. The matter was soon dropped and never
came up at her trial.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs worked at the Veterans Administration hospital in Oklahoma
City from 1990 to July 1995, but the hospital said she was not sent
to the scene of the April 1995 bombing. She later worked at the
Arkansas Heart Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs pleaded with the jury in 1998 to give her the death
penalty, saying: ''I want to be with my babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors told jurors that Riggs' children had become an
inconvenience to her. They said she left the children by themselves
while she competed in karaoke contests and had plotted their deaths
for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The last woman executed in Arkansas was Lavinia Burnett, hanged
in 1845 for being an accessory to murder.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the first woman executed since 1976 was Velma
Barfield, who died by injection in North Carolina in 1984 for
poisoning her boyfriend. The most recent was Betty Lou Beets, put
to death in Texas in February for murdering her fifth husband.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Prosecutor, Deputy Indicted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A prosecutor and deputy have been indicted
on charges of lying to a grand jury about secretly taping
conversations between a murder suspect and his lawyer in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say former Lexington County prosecutor
Francis Humphries committed perjury when he told a grand jury he
did not know if a tape existed of the conversation between B.J.
Quattlebaum and his attorney Jack Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Scottie Frier also faces perjury charges.
</P>
<P>
   Humphries, now a deputy prosecutor in Horry County, will resign
while he fights the perjury charges, his attorney Jack Swerling
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frier, who has been a deputy for nearly 13 years, has been
placed on administrative duty until the charges are resolved, said
Lexington County Sheriff James Metts.
</P>
<P>
   Both men could get up to 10 years in prison and up to a $500,000
fine if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say the videotaping happened in May 1995 as
Quattlebaum was taking a lie detector test. The camera was not
stopped as Quattlebaum's attorney came into the room. Quattlebaum
was arrested shortly after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Quattlebaum shot and killed William D. Swartz,
33, after Swartz interrupted a burglary at his home.
</P>
<P>
   A jury sent Quattlebaum to death row in 1998 without viewing the
tape.
</P>
<P>
   But the state Supreme Court cited the secret taping when it
overturned the sentence this year. No retrial date has been set.

<HEADLINE> First Hispanic Heads Miami Police  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX VEIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A Cuban immigrant was sworn in as Miami's new
police chief Tuesday after his predecessor quit in the political
furor over the Elian Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Martinez, 50, spent 24 years as a police officer. He
becomes the first Hispanic to lead the 1,100-member department.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very thankful for this appointment, and I pledge to this
community that I'm the chief of police for the entire community,''
Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the objections of the mayor, he was selected by City
Manager Donald Warshaw, who could be on his way out after being
fired by the mayor. Warshaw, who was scheduled to leave office
Sunday, won a temporary stay in court late Tuesday barring his
firing.
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw could also keep his job if four of the five city
commissioners overrule the mayor in a vote expected Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez replaces William O'Brien, who resigned following the
April 22 federal raid in which Elian was taken from his Miami
relatives' home.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Joe Carollo was angry that O'Brien hadn't told him that
federal agents were about to seize the 6-year-old. Carollo demanded
Warshaw fire the chief. Warshaw refused and Carollo fired Warshaw
last week. O'Brien then quit, saying Carollo was divisive.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo had said he was against Warshaw hiring a new chief of
police.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is another one of the key examples of the immoral,
unethical actions that this city manager has been making on his way
out,'' Carollo said. ''Out of desperation, he's grabbing at
anything that he can to keep himself in power.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the city charter, Warshaw's firing does not take effect
for 10 days, which will be Sunday. The charter also specifies that
the city manager name the police chief, with no requirement the
mayor be consulted.
</P>
<P>
   ''He named a Cuban-American solely to try to see if he could get
any of the votes of the Cuban commissioners,'' Carollo said of
Warshaw's naming of Martinez as chief. Three of the commissioners
are Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Wilfredo ''Willy'' Gort, who attended the ceremony
Tuesday, said the hiring of Martinez would not sway the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think this commission is going to change its mind
because this individual was named,'' said Gort, who is
Cuban-American. ''I think the mayor of this city has not been able
to work with the manager for quite a while now, but he needs to
have someone he can work with and we can work with.''

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 4, White Sox 1  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Frank Castillo got his first win in nearly two
years by pitching six strong innings and the Toronto Blue Jays used
a three-run seventh inning Tuesday night to beat the Chicago White
Sox 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo (1-2), who pitched in the minors last season, got his
first major league win since July 23, 1998, when he beat Cleveland
for Detroit. Making his fifth start this season, he allowed four
hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago starter Jim Parque, facing a three-game suspension later
this month for his role in a brawl with Detroit, shut out the Blue
Jays on two hits for six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Koch pitched the ninth for his seventh save.
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to some shaky fielding by second baseman Ray Durham,
the Blue Jays got to reliever Kelly Wunsch in the seventh, with
Tony Batista delivering a bases-loaded single and pinch-hitter Brad
Fullmer a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Alberto Castillo walked and Jose Cruz Jr. hit a
hard single past Durham, putting runners at first and third. Craig
Grebeck hit a grounder to third, and when Greg Norton threw to
second for the force, Castillo broke for the plate and scored as
Durham's low throw skipped past catcher Mark Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   After a single by Raul Mondesi, Carlos Delgado hit a grounder to
Norton, who again flipped to second. But Mondesi was ruled safe
because Durham's foot was apparently off the bag, and Delgado beat
the relay to to first to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Batista then followed with a single to right that finished
Wunsch (0-1), and Fullmer greeted Bobby Howry with a long liner to
the fence in center for a sacrifice fly and a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz Jr. hit his 10th homer in the eighth. Paul Konerko hit his
seventh homer leading off the second.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago loaded the bases in the fifth but Castillo fanned
Durham.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Toronto's Andy Thompson, making his first major league
start, appeared to get picked off first by Parque in the fourth
inning but Parque's move was called a balk and Thompson was awarded
second. Thompson was already on his way to the dugout when manager
Jim Fregosi waved him back on the field . ... Chicago SS Jose
Valentin made his 11th error in 24 games. ... On a night when the
crosstown Cubs were playing at the same time in Kerry Wood's return
from elbow surgery, attendance at Comiskey Park was 10,397. ...
White Sox manager Jerry Manuel served the fifth game of his
eight-game suspension. Chicago is 2-3 in his absence.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 5, Twins 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A run-scoring passed ball and a bases-loaded
walk keyed a four-run sixth inning, and Tom Lampkin homered Tuesday
night as the Seattle Mariners rallied past the reeling Minnesota
Twins 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 3-0 in the sixth, the Mariners began their comeback on
RBI singles by David Bell and Carlos Guillen off Joe Mays (0-4).
</P>
<P>
   Bell then scored the tying run when reliever Hector Carrasco's
pitch deflected off Matt LeCroy's glove for a passed ball, and Alex
Rodriguez drove in the go-ahead run by walking on a 3-0 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of Carrasco's 13 pitches was a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Lampkin hit his third homer of the season in the seventh off
LaTroy Hawkins, helping send the Twins to their fifth consecutive
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota pitchers walked a season-high 10. Mariners' batters,
who have 131 walks this season, left the bases loaded three times.
</P>
<P>
   John Halama (3-0) allowed three runs and five hits in five
innings. Kuzuhiro Sasaki, Seattle's fifth pitcher, got three outs
for his fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   Mays, winless since last Sept. 24, escaped a bases-loaded jam in
the fourth when Bell flied out, and Minnesota went ahead in the
bottom half on an RBI infield single by Midre Cummings.
</P>
<P>
   A throwing error by third baseman Cristian Guzman allowed a run
to score in the fifth, and Denny Hocking followed with a sacrifice
fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The last time the Twins finished a season above .500 was
1992, which also was the last time they won a season series against
the Mariners (8-5). ... Seattle hit 30 homers in 12 games against
the Twins last year, a Mariners record for most homer off one team
in one season.

<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- The interim commissioner of the state
Health Department was arrested Tuesday as part of a criminal
investigation into the department and its regulation of nursing
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Brent VanMeter, 46, was being held in the Oklahoma County jail.
He was arrested for allegedly violating a federal code that
pertains to theft or bribery concerning programs that receive
federal funds, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   Statements issued by Gov. Frank Keating and the attorney general
said search warrants were issued for offices at the state agency as
well as some businesses and homes.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left at VanMeter's home were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Drew Edmondson said the federal search warrants
support a joint state-federal investigation into ''possible
criminal activity which may have impacted the health care of
patients in several Oklahoma nursing homes.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the warrants sought records from some agency employees
and private citizens involved in the nursing home industry.
</P>
<P>
   VanMeter has been in the post while the commissioner is on
medical leave.

<HEADLINE> Report: H.S. Star Enters NBA Draft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) -- DeShawn Stevenson, a high school star from
Fresno, Calif., will declare himself eligible for the NBA draft
despite his parent's wishes for him to honor his commitment to
Kansas, ESPN.com reported Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5 guard will make it official Wednesday, according to
the report, and that would make him the first high school player to
declare for this year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   The last high school guard to bypass college for the NBA was
Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got a lot of confidence in myself,'' Stevenson said. ''I
won't give up. Nothing scares me. Kobe was the only other shooting
guard and I'll be the next one. Everyone else who has come out was
a (small forward or power forward).
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something I wanted to do and it's my dream, and I'm going
to go ahead and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, who played at Washington Union High School in Fresno,
is still not eligible academically for a Division I school but was
waiting for a standardized test result, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure I'm going in the first round,'' Stevenson said. ''If
I got the test score earlier, I would have gone to college. But my
name is in the air, so it's better to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knew all along that he was going,'' said Terry Popps,
Stevenson's stepfather. ''We are scared for him. I'm not saying he
won't do well. The league is very young. I don't think there's
enough room for DeShawn.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't be disappointed if he went late second round. If he
goes early first, I would be very happy. But we thought if he went
two years at Kansas he would be a lottery pick.''
</P>
<P>
   Popps told ESPN.com he believes adidas pushed Stevenson to
declare for the draft. Stevenson played for the adidas-sponsored
and Fresno-based Elite Basketball Organization for the past four
years. But the Poppses said the family is also at fault for
allowing Stevenson to change high schools, which they say
contributed to him leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Vaccaro, who runs adidas' summer basketball program,
denied Popps' charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kid wants to come out,'' Vaccaro said. ''He came to me and
asked me, 'Where do you think I'll go.' My answer was, 'You're
definitely going in the first round, but you could do a lot
better.'''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, who has not signed with an agent, said it was his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''(My family) is trying to hurt adidas,'' the 19-year-old said.
''They had nothing to do with it. My family is being a poor sport
about it.''

<HEADLINE> Pirates 10, Cardinals 7  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire hit his ninth home run but his
throwing error also handed the Pittsburgh Pirates the go-ahead run
in a 10-7 victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit his 531st career homer with a man on in the first
off Jason Schmidt. And Jim Edmonds tied McGwire for the team lead
when he connected on a 1-2 pitch from Jose Silva with one out in
the seventh for a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Ray Lankford hit his fourth home run. Lankford
also homered off Mike Williams in the ninth, boosting the
Cardinals' major league-leading total to 59.
</P>
<P>
   But by then the game was out of reach. The Pirates rallied for
six runs in the eighth against Heathcliff Slocumb (0-1), who
entered with a career 0.36 ERA in Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Wil Cordero and Pat Meares singled, and Luis Sojo walked,
loading the bases. Pinch-hitter John Vander Wal greeted Mike Mohler
with a two-run single that tied it at 6.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and runners on first and second, McGwire ranged to
his right to field Warren Morris' grounder and tagged out Bruce
Aven heading to second. Trying for the double play, he followed
with a high floating toss to first base that was way past Mohler's
reach. It was his first error of the season and it allowed Vander
Wal to score.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Giles made it 9-6 with a two-run double for his third RBI
of the game, and Kevin Young added an RBI double off Mike James.
Jeff Wallace (1-0) got the last out in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The NL Central-leading Cardinals began May the way they ended
April, when they set a record with 55 homers. But they got an
off-game from rookie Rick Ankiel, who walked five and allowed four
runs in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   An error by Young at first base allowed the Cardinals to tie it
at 4 in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel, 20, extended his scoreless streak to 16 innings before
Pittsburgh overcame a 3-0 deficit to tie it in the third. Sojo and
Morris drove runs.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, recovering from shoulder inflammation, was on a
75-pitch limit after being activated from the disabled list earlier
in the day. In his first start since April 14, he hit that target
in four innings, allowing two runs and three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Giles added a run-scoring single in the fifth and Cordero, in a
2-for-26 slump, had a run-scoring double in the third for
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cardinals are 17-0 when they don't commit an error and
0-9 when they do. ... Lankford had his 13th multihomer game, his
first this season. ... McGwire has 95 homers and 204 RBIs in 194
career games at Busch Stadium. Lankford is the Busch career homers
leader with 99 in 650 games. He was in an 0-for-12 slide before
homering in the seventh. ... Young has four errors after leading
major league first baseman with 23 last season. ... In 31 innings,
Ankiel has 25 strikeouts and 25 walks. ... Cardinals pitcher Matt
Morris, out since elbow surgery in April 1998, worked 3 1-3 innings
in his first rehab start for Double-A Arkansas. He allowed one run
on two hits with four strikeouts and two walks, throwing 55
pitches. ... Jason Kendall was 0-for-3 with two walks and is in a
1-for-15 slump. ... Schmidt hasn't won since lasy Sept. 19 against
Cincinnati.

<HEADLINE> Suns' Kidd Back in Starting Lineup  </HEADLINE>

   PHOENIX (AP) -- Jason Kidd, out since March 22 with a broken left
ankle, returned to the starting lineup for the Phoenix Suns Tuesday
night in Game 4 of their playoff series against the San Antonio
Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The doctors say he's 100 percent and he's ready to go, so he's
in there,'' coach Scott Skiles said.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd looked different with his newly blond curls, but he played
the same. He finished with nine points and 10 assists in 31 minutes
as the Suns beat the Spurs 89-78 to win the best-of-five series
3-1. Kidd made his first three shots, the last one a 3-pointer to
give the Suns the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd has been working out for more than a week with no ill
effects, and if he can play, he should start, Skiles said. Kidd led
the NBA in assists at 10.1 per game, along with 14.3 points and 7.2
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's one of the best players in the league,'' Skiles said.
''There's no reason to not start. He's comfortable starting. He's
done it his whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd returned before San Antonio's Tim Duncan could. Duncan
practiced on Monday, but said at Tuesday morning's shootaround that
he was too sore to play in a game. Duncan did not appear in the
playoffs because of a slight tear in the cartilage of his left
knee.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Skiles announced Kidd would start, Kidd was more
evasive, saying it would be a game-time decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, I feel good,'' Kidd said. ''I think my body and my mind
is fresh and confident. The biggest thing is I don't want to do
anything to disturb the team. I want to help the team win. The guys
have been playing well without me, so we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiles said he no longer is amazed that players can come back so
quickly from such a serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''That stuff has come so far so fast,'' Skiles said. ''He's a
tough guy. He's been a quick healer before. He worked very hard in
rehab. It would have been very easy for him to just write the
season off. But he's had it in his head that he was going to make
it back, and we've survived long enough for him to be back.''

   PHOENIX (AP) -- Jason Kidd came back, Tim Duncan didn't and the
Phoenix Suns knocked the defending NBA champion San Antonio Spurs
out of the NBA playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway and Rodney Rogers, winner of the NBA's Sixth Man
Award, scored 23 points apiece as the Suns won the best-of-five
series 3-1 with an 89-78 victory Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who also had 10 rebounds, scored eight points and
Hardaway seven in the fourth quarter as Phoenix fought off one last
San Antonio challenge to advance past the first round for the first
time in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns play the winner of the Los Angeles Lakers-Sacramento
series in the Western Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs became the first defending champion to be eliminated
in the first round since the Philadelphia 76ers lost to New Jersey
3-2 in 1984. The 1998 champion Chicago Bulls failed to make the
playoffs last season after Michael Jordan's retirement.
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson tried to carry the load with 21 points and 16
rebounds, but he didn't have enough help. Mario Elie was the only
other San Antonio player in double figures with 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' Cliff Robinson missed 10 of his first 12 shots, but
made two crucial outside jumpers in the fourth quarter to finish
with 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, out since March 22 with a broken left ankle, looked
different with his newly blond curly hair, but he played as well as
ever. He started and made his made his first three shots, the last
one a 3-pointer, and finished with nine points and 10 assists in 31
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, a free agent at the end of the season, might have played
his last game for San Antonio. He didn't play at all in the series
because of a slight ligament tear in his left knee. Duncan
practiced Monday, but decided Tuesday the leg was too sore.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs were down to 10 players, and only one power forward,
after Malik Rose left with a torn medial collateral ligament in his
right knee with 4:07 left in the first half and the Suns leading
31-28.
</P>
<P>
   Without Duncan, Rose, and Jerome Kersey, who dislocated his foot
in Game 2, Samaki Walker was the only power forward left for the
Spurs, and he drew his fourth foul a minute into the third quarter.
That left Sean Elliott at the power forward spot, and he got his
fourth foul with 7:42 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway's fadeaway jumper with 17 seconds left in the period
put Phoenix ahead 68-55, and the Suns led 68-56 entering the final
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs didn't go down easily, though. With David Robinson
resting, Elliott scored six in a row to cut Phoenix's lead to 68-62
with 9:51 to play, and Antonio Daniels' three-point play after a
Suns' turnover made it 70-66 with 8:12 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But Rogers' baseline dunk on a pass from Kidd capped a 6-0 spurt
that put Phoenix back in control, 78-68, with 6:20 to go, and San
Antonio never was closer than eight again.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case throughout the series, Phoenix fell behind
early.
</P>
<P>
   A 14-0 run put San Antonio up 21-8 on Rose's steal and stuff
with 2:33 left in the first quarter. But the Suns followed with a
14-0 surge of their own, taking a 22-21 lead on Hardaway's inside
shot with 10:33 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd's 3-pointer put Phoenix ahead for good, 27-24, with 9:17
left in the half, and they led 42-37 at the break.
</P>
<P>
@Notes: Rogers was presented with the Sixth Man Award before the
game. ... The Spurs have never won a playoff series when they lost
Game 1. ... Hardaway had three turnovers in the first quarter. ...
Derrick Dial, who played in just eight games all season, had five
points in the fourth quarter for San Antonio. ... The Spurs were
24-for-39 from the free-throw line, while Phoenix was 12-for-19.
... Kidd had five turnovers and Hardaway six. ... The Spurs shot 37
percent for the game and the series. ... Randy Livingston, the
Suns' starting point guard the first three games of the series,
played only the final 46.7 seconds.
