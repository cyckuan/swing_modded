<HEADLINE> Iraq, Malaysia Sign Joint Statement on Developing Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Malaysia on Sunday signed a
joint statement on developing bilateral cooperation, the official
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement was signed by Iraqi Minister of Industry and
Minerals Adnan Abd al-Majid al-Ani and visiting Malaysian Foreign
Minister Syed Hamid Albar.
</P>
<P>
The statement touched upon the issues of expanding economic,
trade, oil, agricultural, industrial, transportation and scientific
cooperation between Iraq and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The next round of meetings of the Joint Iraqi-Malaysian Trade
And Economic Committee will be held next year in Kuala Lumpur,
capital of Malaysia, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The just-concluded fifth round of meetings has been very
important in reactivating cooperation between the two countries,
said the Iraqi minister.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement reflected the readiness and keenness of both
Iraq and Malaysia to develop all-round ties, al-Ani added.
</P>
<P>
AlBar expressed belief that trade and economic ties between Iraq
and Malaysia will soon witness major steps forward, terming the
statement as "a true and significant step" to expand bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Declaring his visit to Baghdad "important and fruitful," he said
it will surely push the bilateral relations to a new phase.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement followed Albar's meeting with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During his meetings with Iraqi senior officials including Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan, Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz and
Foreign Minister Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf, AlBar called on the U.N.
to "take serious and decisive efforts" to end the sanctions imposed
on Iraq since 1990.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the U.S. and Britain to abolish the two "
illegal and unjustifiable no-fly zones" in northern and southern
Iraq, set up after the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
AlBar, heading an economic and trade delegation, arrived in the
Iraqi capital on Friday to attend the meetings of the Joint Iraqi-
Malaysian Trade And Economic Committee. The last round was held in
Baghdad in 1989.

<HEADLINE> 2 Turks Indicted in Jordan for Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Two Turkish nationals have been
indicted in Jordan for smuggling 107 kilograms of heroin and other
drugs into the kingdom, police sources here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two men, identified as Adnan Batch, a truck driver who is
now under detention in Jordan, and Ibrahim Oyar, who is at large,
were suspected of colluding with an international drug wing.
</P>
<P>
Adnan was caught at the Jaber check point on the Jordanian-
Syrian border on April 7, when Jordanian customs officers detected
107 kilograms of heroin and other drugs in a secret compartment on
his truck.
</P>
<P>
Street value of the drugs amounted to over half a million
Jordanian dinars (700,000 U.S. dollars). Further investigations are
under way as Adnan confessed that the drugs would be delivered to
an unnamed Jordanian dealer.
</P>
<P>
General Military Prosecutor Mamoun Khasawneh of the Jordanian
State Security Court has endorsed the indictment of the two Turkish
citizens, police said.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the suspects might face death penalties.

<HEADLINE> One in Ten Properties in UK Drops in Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) - One in ten properties in Britain has
fallen in value during the past two years, and in some areas more
than 20 percent has been wiped off house prices.
</P>
<P>
The figures produced by Experian, the information company,
highlight a stark contrast between perceptions of a national price
boom and the reality that the market is severely fragmented.
</P>
<P>
The research released Sunday shows that in 8 percent of postal
regions in England and Wales prices have dropped by up to 5
percent, and by up to 10 percent in 3 percent of regions.
</P>
<P>
The news follows figures from Nationwide building society that
show house prices fell by 0.4 percent in May compared with April.
However, experts say an outright crash is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bank of England, house prices have risen by 16
percent over the past year, but the Bank believes property
inflation will drop back to 10 percent in 2000 and 8 percent in
2001.
</P>
<P>
Some economists think the Bank will start cutting the base rate
later this year. Therefore, borrowers would be well advised not to
fix their mortgage rates now.
</P>
<P>
Bruno Rost from Experian said: "All markets have a nasty habit
of stampeding over cliffs. There are already signs that the
housing boom is coming to a swift end ..."

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges Lebanon to Restore Control of Southern Border Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Sunday urged Lebanon to restore its control in its southern border
area, which he said is a precondition for a French participation
in a future U.N. peacekeeping mission there.
</P>
<P>
During a telephone conversation with United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan, Chirac said that unless Lebanon promises to
send government troops there, France will not join an expanded U.N.
peacekeeping mission in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman of the Elysee presidential palace, Catherine
Colonna, quoted Chirac as saying that according to U.N. Security
Council Resolution 425, the mission of the United Nations Interim
Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is to help Lebanese government restore
control in the territories occupied by Israel in 1978.
</P>
<P>
``Any deployment of U.N. has no other sense but to help Lebanon
restore its authority and (UNIFIL) is not for replacing Lebanon or
doing in its place what it should do,'' said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said that the conditions presented by France for joining an
expanded UNIFIL mission, which includes deployment of Lebanese
government troops in the border area, have not been met.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's border area with Israel has been under the control of
the Hezbollah guerrillas after Israeli troops pulled out two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan has suggested
that the UNIFIL be expanded from the present 4,500 to 7,900 and be
re-deployed in Lebanon's southern border area.
</P>
<P>
France, which has 249 soldiers serving in UNIFIL since 1978,
has been asked to play a leading role in the future U.N. expanded
mission in Lebanon.

Protesters are accusing police "overacting" to their "peaceful
demonstration" against global corporate impact on environment and
human society.
</P>
<P>
Local television said that the peaceful demonstration turned
into an ugly scene when police "pepper sprayed and tear gassed"
the crowd of protesters, whose number is estimated at several
thousand around the city.
</P>

Up to 4,000 Canadian and U.S. police on both sides of the

Foreign ministers of 34 member states have been invited to
attend the three-day 30th OAS General Assembly to be opened Sunday

</P>
<P>
Among issues on the agenda are democracy, human rights, war-
affected children, corporate social responsibility, illicit trade
in drugs and other crimes, according to Canadian Foreign Minister
Lloyd Axworthy, who will chair what he described as "a Ministerial
Dialogue Session."

<HEADLINE> Fuel Shortage Persists In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Fuel shortage in Zimbabwe has become
critical with almost no petrol supplies in Harare while a few
service stations sold only diesel on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Desperate motorists queued at empty service stations with
waning hope and attendants, whose continued employment remains
uncertain, sat around with nothing to do.
</P>
<P>
One service station in Eastlea has had no supplies for the past
week and staff were not sure when the next delivery would be.
</P>
<P>
Fuel shortage in the country began last year in December
following the cutting of credit lines to the National Oil Company
of Zimbabwe (Noczim) over a 250 million U.S. dollars debt.
</P>
<P>
Things seemed to improve somewhat from April after President
Robert Mugabe led efforts to secure reliable sources of fuel from
the Middle East, but the bad situation has returned.
</P>
<P>
Winding queues for petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin
have become a common sight again in most parts of the country's
urban centres as supplies have been erratic.
</P>
<P>
The origins of Zimbabwe's fuel crisis has been blamed on
rampant corruption at Noczim where fuel was procured at
unjustifiably exorbitant prices after tender procedures were
disregarded.
</P>
<P>
Several officials of Noczim and the Transport and Energy
Ministry have been arrested and are being investigated in
connection with corruption at the national oil procuring company.
</P>
<P>
Former Transport and Energy Minister Enos Chikowore has since
resigned after Members of Parliament called for his head together
with that of Finance Minister Hebert Murerwa, who is still in
office.

<P>
NAIROBI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea claimed on Sunday that some
3,755 Ethiopian troops were killed, wounded or captured by its
army on the Assab front and several heavy armored vehicles were
destroyed , according to a news release issued by the Eritrean
Foreign Ministry available here.
</P>
<P>
It said the Eritrean army have captured a large number of
medium and small arms, and communication radios in the battle. It
added that Eritrea has foiled the Ethiopian attacks which launched
on early Saturday morning on the Assab front.
</P>
<P>
The Assab front was quiet Sunday apart from intermittent
shelling that started around 10:00 a.m., the Eritrean foreign
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia declared on May 31 that the war was over. The
announcement was made while it claimed to have recovered all
occupied territories from Eritrea, and attained all its military
objects.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are now involved in a new round of proximity
talks brokered by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fighting between the two Horn of Africa
neighbors erupted on May 12. The conflict between the two

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians Discuss Interim Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinians on
Sunday discussed interim issues such as the release of Palestinian
prisoners, Israel's troop redeployment in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip and security cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat and his Israeli
counterpart Oded Eran met here Sunday afternoon, but nothing has
been decided yet.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side had submitted a long list of about 270
Palestinians slated to be released by Israel, and Eran promised
Erekat that the Israeli side will think over their release in the
future, sources close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side said that there are about 1,600
Palestinians now being held in Israeli jails. Israel had released
over 380 Palestinians so far under signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo Accords signed by the two sides in 1993, Israel
has to carry out the last troop redeployment in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, transferring all the remaining territories to the
Palestinians. Israel has handed over about 40 percent of the West
Bank to the Palestinians so far.
</P>
<P>
Eran told Erekat at the Sunday talks that Israel plans to
implement the last troop redeployment, but the two sides must reach
an agreement on the scope of the redeployment during the final-
status talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Eran also asked the Palestinian side to take measures
to ensure there will be no violent anti-Israeli demonstrations in
the territories, and the release of more Palestinians and further
troop redeployment can not be carried out if such violent acts
happen in the future, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
At least six Palestinians were killed and hundreds of others
wounded in May when thousands of Palestinians took to the streets
in the territories to demand the release of more Palestinian
prisoners from Israeli jails. The Palestinian demonstrators and
security forces clashed with Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side strongly urged Israel to implement the
Sharm el Sheikh peace deal signed last September and wanted the
United States to put more pressure on Israel to force it to
implement this deal, Erekat said after the talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is scheduled to
arrive in the region Monday evening to help the two sides push
their talks forward.

<HEADLINE> Barak Orders Israeli Negotiators Not to Discuss Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
on Sunday ordered Israeli negotiators not to discuss the status of
Jerusalem with their Palestinian counterparts in any talks for the
time being.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Barak stated that he has instructed the
negotiating teams not to hold any discussions on Jerusalem at this
stage," a statement issued after Sunday's weekly cabinet meeting
said.
</P>
<P>
"According to the Camp David and Oslo accords, the Palestinians
will be able to raise the issue in the discussions on the permanent
settlement," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The future of Jerusalem, as well as the return of Palestinian
refugees, the status of Jewish settlements, water, border and
security, are major topics on the negotiation table between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Israel claims Jerusalem as its "eternal and undivided capital",
while the Palestinians want at least East Jerusalem to be the
capital for its future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media earlier reported that Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators had reached a series of agreements regarding Jerusalem
and refugees after nine rounds of so-called "back-channel" talks in
Stockholm, capital of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
However, Barak denied these speculations categorically on
Sunday's cabinet meeting by saying "the negotiations on substantive
issues are still at an early stage."
</P>
<P>
"In any case, reports that Israel has offered the Palestinians
92 percent of the West Bank territories, that Israel is prepared to
either evacuate the rest or leave 50,000 settlers under Palestinian
control, or that Israel has agreed to the return of 300,000
Palestinian refugees, have no basis in reality," Barak noted.
</P>
<P>
Barak also accused the Palestinian leaders of intentionally "
foot-dragging" the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The first reason for the "foot-dragging", according to the
cabinet statement, is that the Palestinians want to divert opinion
from the severe clashes last month between Israeli policemen and
the Palestinian demonstrators who were urging Israel to release
Palestinian security prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The clashes, including the crossfire between Israeli soldiers
and Palestinian security forces, killed at least nine Palestinians
and wounded a thousand others.
</P>
<P>
Barak stated that although the Palestinian National Authority
has detained several suspects who opened fire, it has not taken all
necessary measures to ensure that such events do not recur.
</P>
<P>
The second reason for the Palestinian "foot-dragging" measures,
is that the Palestinians want to consider the possibility of
proceeding directly to the final-phase withdrawal without going
through a framework agreement on final-status issues, the statement
claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to understandings reached between Barak, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, and U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross,
Israel should carry out the final-stage withdrawal from the West
Bank and Gaza Strip in June.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides failed to seal a framework agreement in
mid-May prior to the planned withdrawal. Israel ascribed the delay
of the final-stage pullout to the stagnant talks with the
Palestinians on a final-status framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat and his Israeli
counterpart Oded Eran began their another talks on interim issues,
such as the final-stage Israeli pullback from the territories and
the release of Palestinian prisoners, on Sunday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cyprus Government in Dilemma on Fuel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government is now in a
dilemma on the issue of fuel prices, due to the rejection of its
fuel hike bill by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the Cyprus government
announced the decision to raise petrol price from 40 cents to 44
cents in Cyprus pound (from 64 cents to 70 cents in U.S. dollar) a
liter and diesel from 14.6 cents to 16.6 cents in pound (from 23.4
cents to 26.6 cents in dollar) a liter.
</P>
<P>
The decision came into effect immediately after the
announcement, but after 29 hours, the House of Representatives
rejected it.
</P>
<P>
Voting against the government bill were 24 deputies from the
left-wing AKEL party and the Democratic DIKO party, and 18 ruling
Democratic Rally party deputies favored the bill.
</P>
<P>
AKEL and DIKO considered the price hike as "unpopular", arguing
that crude oil prices were about to come down as the oil-producing
countries had just agreed to increase production.
</P>
<P>
President of the House of the Representatives Spyros Kyprianou
said that the 29-hour price hike was illegal.
</P>
<P>
However, government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou asserted that
there had been nothing illegal about the price rise.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Takis Clerides said that "for me at least the
House decision is incomprehensible."
</P>
<P>
The refusal of the House of Representatives to approve the bill
also made the island's oil importing companies angry, which
threatened not to bring in any more crude.
</P>
<P>
Commerce and Industry Minister Nicos Rolandis confirmed that the
oil companies had told him during an emergency meeting that they
would not buy "a single barrel more" of crude unless the prices
went up or subsidies continued.
</P>
<P>
According to local Sunday Mail newspaper, existing reserves of
oil on the island would last only until the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
Now the government appears to have to carry on subsiding oil
imports, as it has been doing ever since the turn of the year, when
the price of crude hit the roof and the Cyprus pound began to
slide.
</P>
<P>
Crude prices have not come down significantly in the past five
months, and the value of the Cyprus pound against the dollar has
slid to 1.60 dollar one pound, from 1.80 dollar one pound at the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The subsidies to oil companies have already cost the state
coffers some 14 million pounds (22.4 million dollars) and would, if
continued, cost the state some 50 million pounds (80 million
dollars) by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
It is obviously an unbearable burden for the country's already
badly depleted public finances.
</P>
<P>
For the oil importing companies, the high price of crude oil and
the low value of the Cyprus pound against the U.S. dollar mean that
they would lose about 5 million pounds (8 million dollars) a month,
if there were no state subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus cabinet will hold a meeting on Wednesday to
reconsider the fuel price issue.

<HEADLINE> British Army Plays Down High Desertions: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 4 (Xinhua) -- In response to newspaper reports
that a record proportion of soldiers had deserted or gone absent
without leave in 1999, the British Army on Sunday insisted that it
was a "caring employer".
</P>
<P>
"We think of ourselves as a caring employer, and commanding
officers are encouraged to be as compassionate as possible," a
Reuters report quoted "an army spokesman" as saying.
</P>
<P>
The remarks was made after The Observer reported Sunday that
one in 48 soldiers had gone missing in last year, mainly because
of bullying and abuse.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that while the proportion of soldiers
deserting was now the highest since the end of conscription, the
actual number was lower than in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
"The basic position is there were roughly 2,000 soldiers
missing last year. That includes everyone from serious cases to
less serious cases of lateness -- when someone has just missed a
train," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the army had a zero-tolerance attitude
towards bullying and harassment and had put measures in place to
protect recruits, including a confidential support line.
</P>
<P>
Britain's army is under strain from a combination of regular
duties in Northern Ireland, Germany and Cyprus and high-profile
interventions in the Balkans and Sierra Leone, the Reuters report
said.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Sign Accords, Differences Remain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Russia and the
United States signed here Sunday a number of accords on strategic
stability and a joint center sharing information on missile
launches.
</P>
<P>
Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart,
Bill Clinton, expressed satisfaction with their talks, but
differences remain on such issues as arms control and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The accords signed in the Kremlin include a joint statement on
strategic stability principles and a memorandum on the formation
of a joint center for exchanging information about missile
launches and reports from early warning systems.
</P>
<P>
According to the joint statement, the two leaders agreed to
intensify the dialogue on anti-ballistic missile issues and
further cuts in strategic forces in the framework of the proposed
START III treaty.
</P>
<P>
Russia is opposed to U.S. plans to build a national missile
defense system in violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
On strategic arms reduction, Moscow has proposed that each side
cut nuclear warheads to 1,500, but Washington is only prepared to
reduce the stockpile to 2,500 each.
</P>
<P>
In the joint statement, the two presidents agreed that the ABM
treaty makes a significant contribution to the limitation of
strategic armaments and they confirmed their loyalty to the treaty
as a cornerstone of strategic stability.
</P>
<P>
They confirmed their adherence to the continuation of efforts
to strengthen the ABM treaty and make it more effective in the
future "given any changes in the international security sphere,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived here Saturday on a three-day working visit to
Russia. He is scheduled to leave Monday for Ukraine, the last stop
of his Europe tour.

<TEXT>
<P>
Both Russian President Vladimir Putin and his U.S. counterpart,
Bill Clinton, voiced satisfaction with the results of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The accords signed in the Kremlin include a joint statement on
strategic stability principles and a memorandum on establishing a
joint center for the exchange of information about missile
launches and reports from early warning systems.
</P>
<P>
Under the joint statement, the two leaders pledged to intensify
the dialogue on anti-ballistic missile defense issues and further
cuts in strategic forces in the framework of the proposed START
III treaty.
</P>
<P>
Putin told a joint press conference that he was satisfied with
the "spirit quality and contents" of the summit, the first with
Clinton since he was sworn in early last month.
</P>
<P>
"The summit not only confirmed the high standard of our
relations, but also consolidated the trends in our relations for
the nearest future," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also approved joint statements on handling
military grade plutonium and cooperation in combating global
warming at the end of the Russian-U.S. summit in Moscow, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Putin and Clinton noted that the agreement reaffirms the
determination of the two countries to take steps preventing
plutonium from ever being used in nuclear arms or for any other
military purposes and that its handling and disposal should be
safe, reliable, environmentally justified, transparent and
irreversible.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Russian-U.S. joint center for exchanging
information about missile launches and reports from early warning
systems will start operating in north Moscow in June next year.
</P>
<P>
The center will be set up to organize a continuous exchange of
information about ballistic missile and space booster-rocket
launches collected from Russian and U.S. early warning systems. It
will be the first Russian-U.S. military center operating on a
permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived here Saturday on a three-day working visit to
Russia. He is scheduled to leave Monday for Ukraine, the last leg
of his Europe tour.
</P>
<P>
The two sides failed to settle their differences over U.S.
plans to build a national missile defense system that Moscow
believes to be in violation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty, and over Russia's military campaign against rebels in its
breakaway Chechen republic.
</P>
<P>
They also have to bridge their gaps on the reduction of
strategic arms under the third stage of Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty START). Moscow wants to bring down the number of nuclear
warheads each to 1,500, but Washington is only prepared to the
figure of around 2,500.

<HEADLINE> S. leone Rebels Offer Peace for Sankoh Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean rebels field commander
Issa Ceesay has reiterated a demand for the release of rebel
leader Foday Sankoh as a condition for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcast Corporation (BBC) quoted him on Sunday as
speaking in one of its exclusive interviews that the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels now wanted to work with
the United Nations for peace.
</P>
<P>
The rebel general was making the appeal at a time when the UN
peacekeeping forces were making a push to re-occupy positions it
abandoned when the rebels attacked them in early May.
</P>
<P>
He said via phone from a rebel controled region in Sierra Leone
that Sankoh should be released to a neutral country such as Togo,
where the shattered Lome peace accord was signed in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
He also said Sankoh was the only man he would take orders from.
</P>
<P>
He also denied a UN announcement that the RUF attacked Indian
peacekeepers as they occupied the strategic crossroads at Rogberi
Junction.
</P>
<P>
The Indian contingent is now digging in defensively at Rogberi,
 85 kilomerters from the capital Freetown, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
The UN mission head in the West African nation Oluyemi Adeniji
had said that the international troops would, where necessary,
use force to retake more positions from rebel control.
</P>
<P>
He said the RUF would have to withdraw voluntarily to the
positions agreed in the Lome accord or be forced to do so.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a combination of diplomacy and force. We are
determined to enforce the Lome agreement," he said Sunday in the
country's capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
UN forces are now in striking distance of the town of Lunsar,
on the road to the eastern rebel stronghold of Makeni and the
diamond mines which have been the key cause of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Pro- government forces captured Lunsar on Monday but were
forced into a hasty withdrawal a day later.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh is currently held by the Sierra Leone Government in a
secret location and the government is believed to have prepared
criminal charges against him.
</P>
<P>
He was last under arrest in 1998, in the hands of the Nigeria
led West African peacekeeping force or Ecomog, but he was
released to participate in the peace accord.

<HEADLINE> One China Principle Tallies With International Law, People's Daily (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though Taiwan is still separated from the Chinese mainland, it
should never be turned into a sovereign state under the name of
the "Republic of China," and the separation doesn't mean that the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits can become two sovereign states.
And the Chinese people cannot brook separation of China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, the article notes.
</P>
<P>
The state of separation on both sides of the Taiwan Straits is
an issue left over by the civil war of China in the 1940s. As to
how to resolve that issue is entirely China's internal affair. The
separation has nothing to do with China's legal status as a
sovereign state or China's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
The continued separation between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait is the result of foreign interference and separatist
activities in Taiwan, the article says.
</P>
<P>
In fact, since the People's Republic of China was founded in
1949, it has never tolerated comments on the "undecided status of
Taiwan", "one China, one Taiwan" or "Two Chinas." On the contrary,
it has always upheld its right to exercise sovereignty over Taiwan
and will never relinquish this right, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
The separation between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits is
abnormal and temporary -- the situation cannot last indefinitely.
And it should not be the basis for Taiwan to proclaim itself a
sovereign state, the article notes.

<HEADLINE> One China Principle Tallies With International Law, People's Daily (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The one China principle is based
not only on undeniable facts but also on international law, says a
bylined article to be published Monday in the People's Daily,
China's leading newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The one China principle took shape in the course of the Chinese
people's struggle to defend national sovereignty and territorial
integrity. Abiding by this principle is the prerequisite to
solving the Taiwan issue and reaching the peaceful reunification
of the motherland, the paper says.
</P>
<P>
Under international law, the status of a state is not affected
by the change of its name. The current name of the state was
approved by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
held in Beijing in 1949. Now, any mention of China is a reference
to the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
International law supports the status of Taiwan as an integral
part of China. Through the end of the 19th century, all previous
governments in China held jurisdiction over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo Declaration issued by China, the United States and
Britain in 1943 is an international document detailing the status
of Taiwan. It affirms the illegality of Japanese aggression
against Taiwan. Japan surrendered in August 1945, and the then
Chinese government resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Taiwan
and the Penghu Islands on October 25 the same year. On October 26,
the then Chinese government proclaimed that Taiwan is a province
of China.

BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China's top environmental
protection official today gave marching orders to 40 personages
selected as the country's "environment envoys."

<P>
Dr. Li Hong, who is known for her tireless work in
environmental protection, was one of those chosen who have great
concerns about China's environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
"The reason the Earth is so polluted is because of the our
ignorance," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Tang Xiyang, another envoy who is famous for his environment-
oriented writings, said the history of nature is mature, while the
history of mankind is still young and naive, and that human beings
have committed too many foolish environmental mistakes in history.

environment" who is also known for his environment-related

The UAE also achieved a surplus in the total balance account for
5.6 billion dirhams (1.530 billion dollars) and a 6.4 billion
dirhams (1.75 billion US dollars) surplus in current account.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in trade balance surged from only 2 billion dirhams
(546.45 million dollars) in 1998 to 12.4 billion dirhams (3.3
billion dollars) in 1999 due to the increase in the dirham exchange
rate against currencies of all UAE's leading trade partners, except
Japan.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Holds 3rd Round of Senate Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The third round of Thailand's
senate election for the last 12-vacant Senate seats was held
Sunday, mostly in the northeastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
There were signs of possible vote buying and frauds in some
provinces during Sunday's voting, according to a report from
Thailand's Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in the report that it has tentatively set
the date for the fourth-round poll on June 18, just one week
before the reconvention of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The ordinary elections for Thailand's 200 Senate seats were
held on March 4, but 78 winners were judged to have links with
polling fraud. The second round of election to fill those seats
was held on April 29, but was again marred by frauds.
</P>
<P>
The senatorial election is part of the country's political
reform plan based on the present constitution, aimed to eliminate
vote buying and frauds.
</P>
<P>
The 200-seat Senate will have the rights to examine and deprive
politicians who are found guilty of any irregular practice.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Develops Automotive E-Commerce Portal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Three organizations in South
Africa's information Technology, vehicle finance and automotive
industries announced on Sunday that they have joined forces to
develop a local automotive E- business portal.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement released here, Retail Motor Industry
(RMI), Dimension Data and WesBank said the 50 million rand (about
7.15 million U.S. dollars) venture will provide
business-to-business and business-to- consumer E-commerce
services.
</P>
<P>
"The portal will be a powerful, fully transactional solution
which offers real value to the entire motor industry and their
customers," RMI chief executive Derrick Dixon said.
</P>
<P>
"The portal will offer consumers access to RMI dealers and
suppliers nationally through a one-stop online 'shop'. They will
be able to buy vehicles, finance and insure them, arrange services
and repairs, purchase accessories and tyres and do a myriad other
vehicle related tasks -- all electronically."
</P>
<P>
Dixon said the South African automotive industry is ideally
positioned to start such a project because the country has access
to world-class information technology, skills, financial resources
and motor industry knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Dimension Data executive chairman Jeremy Ord said the
initiative brought together the most credible and logistically
sound partnership to act as a an "impartial facilitator" for the
venture.
</P>
<P>
WesBank chief executive Ronnie Watson said: "As we were the
first financial institution to provide instant finance facilities
within motor dealerships, it's a natural progression for WesBank
to take the lead in assisting the motor industry to establish a
virtual point of sale option."

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Should Improve Workers' Skills: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- South African Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin said on Sunday that his government
should improve the skills of its workers and produce better
products in order to compete on world markets.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the new 30 million rand (about 4.3 million
U.S. dollars) expansion of Kolosus Automotive Leather, Erwin said
the old South Africa, which was "protected from the world,
isolated from the world, trading only with ourselves", could not
continue.
</P>
<P>
Kolosus is one of South Africa's major producers of automotive
leather and the technologically advanced plant is designed to help
it expand its share of a very competitive world market.
</P>
<P>
"We had to begin trading with the whole world, making things
that compare to the best in the world. This has not been easily
done. It has meant many things have had to change," Erwin said.
</P>
<P>
"We have had to improve the skills of our workers, to produce
better quality products quickly for motor manufacturers in Europe
and the rest of the world," he added, emphasizing South Africa's
future lies in modern factories such as the Kolosus plant, which
is better skilled, better equipped and more efficient.
</P>
<P>
Erwin further pointed out that "the more investors and business
leaders and overseas investors can see modern factories here, the
more they will invest in South Africa."

<HEADLINE> S. African Democratic Party to Focus on Property Bill in Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The controversial draft
Property Bill and extending land rights to the homeless will be
the cornerstone of the South African opposition Democratic Party
local government elections, DP leader Tony Leon said in a
statement on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Leon said that Provincial and Local Government Minister Sydney
Mufamadi did not need the huge range of powers granted to him in
the bill to make regulations about rates.
</P>
<P>
He said the legislation would allow Mufamadi to control the
substance of the Act, without needing the approval of the
legislature or input from the public.
</P>
<P>
"Ratepayers are being kept in the dark about the content of
this legislation -- they literally do not know what they are
voting for in the local government elections," Leon said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the draft bill, the DP will campaign to outsource all
municipal services, offer incremental services, provide better
financial management and enforce rates and service charges more
strictly and equally.
</P>
<P>
Leon said municipal services, including refuse removal,
transport and water and sanitation, could be provided cheaper and
more effectively by private companies.
</P>
<P>
They would also offer "top-up" extra services for individual
households.
</P>
<P>
He said rent and service defaulters who could afford the fees
should be subject to criminal sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Local government elections are set to take place in November.

<HEADLINE> New Find of Japanese War Bonds in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Huang Wensai, a 63-year-old man in
this capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
today made public his collection of war bonds and stocks issued by
the Japanese government and companies during its war of aggression
in China.
</P>
<P>
Huang's documents, all of which are about his age, include four
war bonds and 14 stock certificates, many of which are the first
of their kind to be revealed in China.
</P>
<P>
Huang told Xinhua today that his father, who was a grocery
owner in Changchun City of northeast China's Jilin Province, was
forced by the Japanese to buy the stocks and bonds in 1938.
</P>
<P>
At that time, the three northeast China provinces of
Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning were occupied by Japanese
invaders, who sold large amounts of compulsory stocks and bonds to
local Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The white-haired Huang said that his father had to sell his
business and all of his belongings to pay for his bond quotient.
</P>
<P>
The stocks, each worth 70,000 yen and amounting to 1,411 shares
at the time, were from the Nissan, Hitachi, and companies involved
in petroleum, engineering, mining, chemical, offshore fishing,
agriculture and forestry industries.
</P>
<P>
With clear watermarks and seal prints of cherry blossoms, the
stock certificates were made of special paper used exclusively by
the then Japanese Ministry of Finance, according to experts with
the Guangxi regional museum.
</P>
<P>
One of the bonds has a par value of 1,000 yen and is clearly
marked as a "State Pan-East Asia War Bond" issued by the Japanese
government in 1944. Three other bonds issued by Japan's Kangyo
Bank are valued at between 20-50 yen each.
</P>
<P>
Printed on the government bond is a striking design of Fuji-san,
a Japanese warship carrying the Japanese national flag, as well as
airplanes and tanks.
</P>
<P>
"The securities are proof of the crimes of Japanese militarists
in China. They prove that the Japanese were charging the Chinese
people to feed the aggression in China," said Zhang Peisheng, a
renowned Chinese economist, after seeing Huang's telltale papers.
</P>
<P>
Huang said that he has refused to sell his collection for some
high offers, holding firmly that the Japanese should repay their
debt to him.
</P>
<P>
He remembers, with sadness, how thin his father was after he
walked thousands of miles from northeast China to return to his
hometown in Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
"At his deathbed in 1976, my father handed me the key to a
wooden box, in which he kept the papers," Huang said, tears
welling in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
He said he may resort to legal action to get compensation from
the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that Japanese war bonds were also found in
Tianjin, Wuhan and other Chinese cities in the past few years.

Some 800,000 hectares of farmland have been affected by the
drought. The region received precipitation of less than 35 mm this
year, which was 60 percent less than normal.

Drought has plagued the prefecture for four years running. Over
one million people and 1.5 million livestock are suffering from a

ROME, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and another
one critically injured in a head-on collision early Sunday morning
between two cargo trains outside the station of Solignano, not far
from the Italian central northern city of Parma.
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred at 3:45 a.m. local time (1:45 GMT) when a 22-
carriage train traveling from Livorno to Bologna apparently
ignored a red light and plunged into a 13-carriage train, which
was on its way from Padua to La Spezia on the western coast of
Italy.
</P>
<P>
The two drivers of each train were all killed immediately and
the injured has been sent to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Italian Transport Minister Pierluigi Bersani, describing the
crash as a "real tragedy," said there appeared to be no technical
problems with the trains or the track which could have caused the
accident.
</P>
<P>
But Ezio Gallori, head of the train drivers' union Comu, said
that human error could not be blamed for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
This was the third crash on this stretch of track within eight
months, following the first one in October, 1999 which injured 20
people and the second on February 1 of this year, leaving four

<P>
The city has also selected several local hospitals with quality

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, German FM Discuss Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
with German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer on Sunday to discuss
the latest developments of the Middle East peace process and
economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the state of different arenas in the peace
process, notably on the Palestinian and the Syrian tracks, along
with regional and Euro-Mediterranean cooperation," Fischer told
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said that Germany is keen on making contributions, along with
its partners, to the progress of the Arab-Israeli peace talks in a
bid to realize peace and stability in the Middle East and the
neighboring Mediterranean region.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel have made little progress in their
negotiations for a final peace agreement on thorny issues which
they plan to sign in September. Syria and Israel have yet to resume
talks on the return of the Golan Heights that the Jewish state
occupied from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said that he and Mubarak also discussed the growth of
investments and trade between Germany and Egypt, adding that these
topics would be at the center of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
state visit to Cairo in October.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the second largest exporter to Egypt and is the
seventh largest importer of Egyptian goods.
</P>
<P>
Fischer arrived in Cairo for a two-day visit on Saturday, when
he held talks with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on regional

issues, bilateral ties and the cooperation between Egypt and the
European Union, which are on the way to signing a partnership
agreement aimed at forging closer cooperation in the political,
economic and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
After Egypt, Fischer will travel to Israel and the Palestinian
self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Calls on Settlement Leaders to Condemn Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
Sunday called on settlement and spiritual leaders to unequivocally
condemn threats of violence against political leaders.
</P>
<P>
Barak related threats on his life at the cabinet meeting Sunday
morning, reported Israel Radio, amid an increasing number of death
threats received by Barak's office.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said violent acts will not stop historical
processes.
</P>
<P>
Barak insisted no attacks will stop the peace process with the
Palestinians despite the death threats against him by the right-
wing settlers.
</P>
<P>
There has been reports of threats against Barak in recent days.
Leader of the right-wing Yesha Council of Settlements Shimon Riklin
last week even threatened another murder to prevent further
territorial concessions by Barak.
</P>
<P>
Settlement leaders said Sunday morning they are opposed to any
violent acts. But they called on Barak to refrain from taking steps
that will lead to a schism in the nation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Knesset (parliament) Speaker Avraham Burg called on the
country's rabbis to put a stop to violent acts or speech in their
communities. Burg said that "destructive Judaism is not Judaism at
all."
</P>
<P>
Following rising threats against the safety of political
leaders, the Israeli General Security Service has decided to
tighten security around Prime Minister Ehud Barak and government
ministers and to increase personnel and intelligence operations.
</P>
<P>
Barak told the Labor Party's Central Committee on Friday that
Israel will keep 80 percent of settlers on the West Bank under
Israeli sovereignty in a possible upcoming agreement with the
Palestinians. He said such an agreement should be seen as a
historic achievement.
</P>
<P>
The future of Israeli settlements is one of the tough issues to
be solved in the final status negotiations between Israelis and
Palestinians, who aim to clinch a permanent accord by September 13.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio Sunday morning, National
Religious Party Knesset Member Rabbi Haim Druckman said left-wing
elements are using the issue as a tool for silencing right-wing
objections to Barak's policies.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Lists 2000 Global Award Winners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- An aboriginal community in

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Senate President Urged to Resign by His Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Deputy Senate President,
Alhaji Abubakar has urged the Senate President Chuba Okadigbo to
resign immediately, accusing the top legislator of a demonstrated
lack of personal integrity in recent events.
</P>
<P>
He also said Saturday in his Abuja home that the senate will
re- convene on Monday, as against the will of the senate president
to adjourn the legislature's session until July 7, reported
Nigerian newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said Okadigbo's removal of the two maces in the
senate's chamber, will not prevent the senate from re-convening,
for the senate was to make two new ones.
</P>
<P>
The police, claiming to be acting on the request of some
senators, stormed Okadigbo's Abuja residence Friday, but failed
to retrieve the removed maces.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the senate president told the police
he had sent the maces, symbol of the senate power, to his
hometown.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo, when challenged on the event, said
the police's act is a clear breath of the immunity enjoyed by the
country's top legislators. But Obasanjo didn't comment on the
raging dispute between the president and vice president of the
senate.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar also said by such acts as removal of maces to stop the
senate from debating on bills of vital importance and urgency for
his country, Okadigbo had demonstrated "an amazing lack of
self-control and complete lack of legitimacy and support from
senators".
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Okadigbo, who is the third most powerful
politician in Nigeria after the president and vice president,
insisted that he was the legitimate custodian of the maces and
has the power to adjourn the senate.
</P>
<P>
He described Friday's drama of forcing into his home by the
police as clear example of "executive lawlessness".
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo has repeatedly criticized the senate for
being responsible for the constant delays in passing important
bills, such as the anti-corruption bill or the 2000 federal
budget into laws.
</P>
<P>
The senators on the other hand accuse President Obasanjo of
acting unilaterally in issues that require the approval of the
senate.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's White Farmers Criticize Government for Farm Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Commercial Farmers Union
(CFU) has described as a slap in the face of donors last week's
preliminary notice by the government to compulsorily acquire 804
farms for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
CFU Vice-President Collin Cloete said it was unfortunate that
the government decided to go ahead with the resettlement when
various donors were making submissions to assist in the
resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
"We will make our position clear this week when we have
explored all the legal aspects," said Cloete, adding that the
farmers feared further invasions, a situation that could disrupt
winter cropping.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe's government, buoyed by unequivocal
support from fellow Southern African Development Community
governments, decided to go ahead and take the farms without
compensation, much to the displeasure of western powers,
particularly former colonial master Britain.
</P>
<P>
The government has asked owners of the 804 farms until July 2
to file objections but this will not mean their land will not be
taken as this would mean the thousands of war veterans and
villagers occupying some 1,500 farms in protest to a slow
resettlement program, will merely dig in.
</P>
<P>
The UNDP, which had reversed its stance to stall land aid in
the spirit of the land conference it co-hosted with the
Zimbabwean government in 1998, seems to have reverted to it
following the gazetting of farms the government intends to take.
</P>
<P>
According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, a special
representative of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who had
initiated the offer for the UNDP to put together a financial
package to fund the land reforms, Mark Malloch-Brown had called
off his trip to Harare in apparent protest at the designation of
804 farms.
</P>
<P>
This has raised questions as to whether UNDP is genuinely
concerned with equitable land redistribution in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cloete said some of the listed farms belong to
tobacco farmers and this would affect deliveries of the crop to
the auction floors.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco sales were expected to bring in more than 300 million
U.S. dollars of the much needed foreign currency which has been
short for months now and has caused serious economic problems
like fuel shortages.
</P>
<P>
On the ability of farmers to finance their 100 million U.S.
dollars losses to farm invasion, Cloete said banks indicated they
would consider individual cases and act accordingly.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Opposition Rapping PM's New Controversial Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
was denounced by opposition again on Sunday for another
controversial remark involving the Japanese emperor, in which he
used "kokutai", a term referring to the national polity centering
on the emperor before and during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Opposition party officials taking part in Sunday's live
television debate programs said, when campaigning for the June 25
parliamentary election, they will take up the matter together with
Mori's May 15 remark that Japan is a "divine nation" with the
emperor at its center.
</P>
<P>
"It is nothing but the thought of state Shintoism," Hirohisa
Fujii, secretary general of the Liberal Party (LP), said during
one of the TV shows. Shinto was the state religion in Japan before
and during World War II, deifying the emperor as a living god.
</P>
<P>
"He (Mori) has made remarks that may be interpreted as denying
the Japanese Constitution or the modern universal principle that
sovereignty resides in the people. I think he is not fit to be
prime minister," LP leader Ichiro Ozawa told reporters in Morioka,
northeastern Japan.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ)
Tsutomu Hata said, "It has the same context as the 'divine nation'
remark, the same idea of the emperor's sovereignty and hope to
retain the 'kokutai'."
</P>
<P>
Top officials of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the
Japanese Communist Party (JCP) also lashed out at Mori's remark.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) showed displeasure at
their leader's remark.
</P>
<P>
"I hope he will be careful enough not to make remarks (after)
which he will have to explain what he really meant," said LDP
secretary general Hiromu Nonaka.
</P>
<P>
Mori made the mistake Saturday when criticizing JCP for its
disapproval of Japan's imperial system and the Self-Defense Forces
in a speech in Nara, ancient capital in southwestern Japan. He
said, "How could we possibly secure Japan's 'kokutai' (national
polity) and ensure public safety with such a party?"
</P>
<P>
"Kokutai" was commonly used to refer to the Japanese polity
before and during World War II. It means rule by an unbroken
imperial line and the concept of the state as a family, which
defines the relationship between the emperor and his subjects as
that between father and children.
</P>
<P>
Japan's defeat in World War II and the reforms afterwards have
brought an end to "kokutai".
</P>
<P>
Earlier on May 15, Mori said Japan is a divine nation with the
emperor at its center. His remark drew wide criticism as it echoed
the ideology behind Japan's wartime militarism.

<HEADLINE> China Continues Ban on Crop Stalks Burning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- As the summer harvest
approaches, China is reminding its farmers to heed the ban on crop
stalks burning.
</P>
<P>
Officials from State Environmental Protection Administration,
the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Science and
Technology said at a meeting today in Shijiazhuang, capital of
north China's Hebei Province, that farmers should continue the
nationwide ban on crop stalks burning.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the burning of large amounts of crop stalks
not only pollutes the air, but also affects the normal operation
of trains, buses and planes.
</P>
<P>
Burning of crop stalks would be banned this year especially on
both sides of 13 expressways, including the Beijing-Shijiazhuang,
Shanghai-Hangzhou and Xi'an-Baoji ones, and of some rections of
the Beijing-Guangzhou and Beijing-Shenyang railway lines.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that air quality in the cities like Beijing,
Tianjin, Shanghai and Shijiazhuang has improved thanks to the
prohibition of crop stalks burning, and fewer fires have been
reported.
</P>
<P>
Of the 600 million tons of crop stalks China produces every
year, 100 million tons are turned into manure and returned to the
farmland, 170 million tons are processed into fodder, and the rest
are either burned or cast away.

<HEADLINE> GCC To Discus Qatar pro-Iraq Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Qatar has raised a proposal on easing
the 10-year-long international embargo on Iraq during a meeting of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) held in Jeddah Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
GCC foreign ministers voiced welcome of the proposal and any
initiatives intended to lessen the suffering of the Iraqi people
under the U.N.-imposed sanctions since Iraqi invasion of
neighboring Kuwait in l990.
</P>
<P>
The details of the Qatari proposal are to be sent to the GCC
member states for appraisal.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of preserving Iraq's independence,
territorial integrity and sovereignty, the GCC foreign ministers,
however, said Iraq should comply with all U.N. Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, Qatar Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin al-Thani called
in Kuwait for a regional initiative to lift the sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process and the Israeli withdrawal from
South Lebanon, the GCC foreign ministers said the process stumbled
after Israel failed to comply with the signed agreements,
expressing hope that Lebanon's sovereignty and independence should
be respected.
</P>
<P>
They cautioned that Israel should not make its northern border
security a pretext to launch offensives against Lebanese people,
urging that just and permanent peace should be established soon.
</P>
<P>
On the relations with Iran, they expressed the GCC countries'
keenness on better ties with the country based on the principles of
good neighborliness, mutual respect, non-interference in each
other's internal affairs and resolving disputes through peaceful
means.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed hopes that Tehran can co-operate with the
GCC's Tripartite Commission on the Disputed Islands Issue between
United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iran for a peaceful settlement of
that territorial stand-off .
</P>
<P>
The three Gulf-based islands of Abu Mousa, Greater and Lesser
Tunbs lie close to the strategic Hormuz Strait. They have been
under Iran's control since l971 but are also claimed by UAE which
called for international arbitration in the Hague. Iran rejected
the notion, holding that the disputed islands are its national
territories.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni President Leaves For Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh
left here Sunday morning for a state visit to Germany.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to discuss the bilateral relations between Yemen
and Germany and the ways to further develop them with German
Chancellor Jerhard Schroeder and top German officials.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the Yemeni and German leaders will also focus
on the developments of the Middle East peace process, the situation
in the Horn of Africa region in light of the peaceful efforts being
made to stop the raging border fighting between Ethiopia and
Eritrea and the endeavors of achieving national reconciliation in
Somalia, the local daily Al-Thawra reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Abdul-Qader Ba-Jammal as saying that "the visit is specially
important because Germany is one of the main development partners,"
expressing hope that it can attract more German investment into
Yemen.
</P>
<P>
It will provide a significant opportunity to acquaint German
business people with the successful administrative and financial
reforms Yemen achieved over the past five years, he added.
</P>
<P>
The joint co-ordination between both countries is going on well
not just because Germany is one of Yemen's principal aid donors,
but also because it enjoys strong presence within the European
group which will further enhance the Yemen-EU partnership, Ba-Gamal
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Saleh will inaugurate the Yemeni pavilion at
the Expo 2000 World Exhibition which opened in Hanover on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> No Progress in Final Status Talks: Palestinian Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- "No progress has been made in the Final
Status Talks with Israel though negotiations are seriously going
on", Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) Executive Committee
Secretary General Abu Mazen said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He told Voice of Palestine Radio, "the talks were stalled for
three days and the two teams are consulting their respective
leaderships on the new developments in negotiations."
</P>
<P>
While calling upon Israeli government to stop its settlement
activities, the Palestinian official stressed the need that Israel
should return to pre-June-1967 Middle East war border lines and to
implement the U.N. Security Council Resolutions 194, 242,and 338.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Council (PLC) Speaker and Chief
Palestinian Negotiator to the Final Status talks, Ahmed Qurei,
clarified that there still were a wide gab between both sides
specially on the major issues in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli stand on issues of Jerusalem and refugees was still
far from international resolutions and the principle of the peace
process, Qurei pointed out stressing that Jerusalem would be the
capital of the planned Palestinian state and that U.N. Security
Council Resolution 194 was the sole way for resolving the refugees
issue.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian delegation rejected an Israeli proposal to
discuss the security matters, he said that such subject should not
be handled before demarcating the borders between Israel and the
would-be Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
He denied as "baseless" the London-based Arabic-daily Al-
Haiyat's report about a breakthrough in the final status talks
between the Palestinian and Israeli teams.
</P>
<P>
PLO Executive Committee in a statement on Saturday night said "
all previous rounds of talks came to a dead end as the Israeli side
failed to comply with the signed agreements or resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Council is to meet on June 28 and 29 to
discuss the date of declaration of the Palestinian statehood.

Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's Center Party Chairman and Tourism Minister Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak is to be appointed transport minister and deputy
prime minister to replace former Center leader Yitzhak Mordechai,
who resigned from the government after the attorney-general
endorsed his indictment on counts of indecent assault and sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
The transport portfolio agreement was reached in a meeting
between Shahak and Prime Minister Barak in Tel Aviv on Friday.
Barak affirmed that he has no intention on reneging on a Center-One
Israel coalition pact, which assigns the Transportation Ministry to
the Center's leading figure.
</P>
<P>
Shahak's re-assignment will be delayed for a few days, while
Barak negotiates with the Center Party's new number two, Knesset
(Parliament) member Dan Meridor, about the tourism portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak said Friday that Israel should see an agreement with
the Palestinians in which 80 percent of settlers remain under
Israeli sovereignty as an historical achievement.
</P>
<P>
Barak, speaking at a meeting of his Labor Party's central
command on Friday, which was convened to elect a candidate for the
presidency, addressed recent criticisms leveled against him,
including by Interior Minister Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
He said:" If we reach a situation whereby, either under a
framework agreement or permanent status accord, 80 percent or more
of the settlers in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) remain in an
area recognized by the rest of the world as solely Israel's, under
Israeli sovereignty, we will have accomplished an historic and
unique achievement."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Russian anti-terrorist troops rescued Adi Sharon, a 12-year-
old Israeli, on Thursday night, following a ten-month captivity at

The boy was found in a basement in the two of Penza, some 560
kilometers southeast of Moscow. Adi is recovering in a Moscow
hospital from his order, which involved the severing of two of his
fingers, and is expected to arrive in Israel with his father next
week.
</P>
<P>
Barak expressed his gratitude on Saturday to Russian President
Vladimir Putin for the freeing of the boy. According to Russian
news agencies, the 13 gang members responsible for the kidnapping

<HEADLINE> Sharak to Be Named Israeli Transport Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Center Party Chairman,
Tourism Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak is to be appointed transport
minister and deputy prime minister in replacement of Yitzhak
Mordechai who is to stand trial on sex charges.
</P>
<P>
The Transport portfolio agreement was reached in a meeting
between Shahak and Prime Minister Ehud Barak in Tel Aviv on Friday,
reports here said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Barak confirmed that he has no intention on reneging on a
Center-One Israel coalition pact that assigns the Transportation
post to the Center Party's leading figure.
</P>
<P>
Shahak's reassignment will be put off for a few days as Barak
has to negotiate with the Center's Party's new number two man,
Knesset (parliament) Member Dan Meridor, about the tourism
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Meridor have discussed this portfolio twice with no
results yielded. Meridor, chairman of the Knesset Foreign Affairs
and Defense Committee, has reservations about the assignment as he
sets his sight on other posts such as the Justice Ministry
portfolio now held by Yossi Beilin (One Israel). Meridor is also
said to be interested in receiving the Defense portfolio, now held
by Barak.
</P>
<P>
There have been reports that Barak may use the opportunity of
Mordechai's resignation to reshuffle the cabinet in view of Housing
Minister Yitzhak Levy's intention to quit the government over the
handover of the Arab village Abu Dis just outside Jerusalem to full
Palestinian control. Levy is from the five-member National
Religious Party.
</P>
<P>
Another vacancy in the cabinet is also likely to be created as
Regional Cooperation Minister Shimon Peres is the leading candidate
for president.
</P>
<P>
Barak's aid have indicated that the prime minister is eager for
Meridor to take the Tourism offer, and that he plans to assign
Meridor, a close friend of Barak, to the ministerial team
responsible for advanced stages of negotiations with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In case Meridor turned down the Tourism portfolio proposal, the
same offer will be put to the Center's next highest-ranking figure,
Knesset Member Ronim Milo.
</P>
<P>
In the meanwhile, the ex-transport minister Mordechai has
appealed for a one-month postponement of the Knesset House
Committee hearing, which is due to convene on Monday to decide
whether to strip him of immunity.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein, who has called for
stripping Mordechai of immunity as Knesset Member to pave the way
for him to be put on trial, is expected to reply to Mordechai's
request on Sunday. The former Center chairman has already received
a one-week delay to consider whether to attend the hearing.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, retired general at the age of 55, submitted his
resignation at the end of May in the face of charges that he
sexually assaulted three women over the past eight years. If
convicted, he could face up to seven years in prison.

<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for a separate state for minority
Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, have engaged in a
ferocious assault in recent weeks in a bid to retake their former
stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Defense General Anuruddha Ratwatte said
Saturday that the military situation in Jaffna was still critical,
but with an improvement in troop morale, reinforcements and new
weapons, they were able to defend Jaffna.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blast Rocks Afghan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 4 (Xinhua) - A bomb blew off in central Kabul
early Sunday but fortunately no casualties or damage was caused,
sources from the Afghan capital said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was planted at a corner of the Zarnigar Park, opposite
the ministry of communications building, and exploded during the
morning rush hour, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers of the ruling Taliban militia cordoned off the area,
and said they would not rule out the possibility of a bigger blast
following the small explosion.
</P>
<P>
They suspected that it was supporters of opposition commander
Ahmad Shah Masood who had staged the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban seized Kabul in 1996 and now control most of
Afghanistan. Masood's forces in the northeast, however, have so
far foiled the militia's attempts to take the whole country.

<P>
-- The British Queen has had her first meeting with Camilla

</P>

<HEADLINE> Turkey Sets to Normalize Ties with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry
Undersecretary Faruk Logoglu is scheduled to pay an official visit
to Iraq between June 4-7 to smooth the way for better relations
between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The senior foreign ministry official's visit is taking place at
a time when Iraq has accused Turkey of providing air bases for U.S.
and British warplanes which have recently intensified their strikes
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Logoglu is expected to touch on all the
bilateral and regional issues with his host Nuri Ismail Al-Weis,
senior undersecretary of the Iraqi Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
But the two men would most possibly focus their discussions on
the so-called Operation Northern Watch by the U.S. and Britain, a
major issue plaguing the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to a Baghdad report, Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad
Al-Sahaf has blamed Turkey for allowing the United States and Great
Britain to use its territory to launch air strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahaf sent a letter to the secretary-general of the Arab
League, Esmat Abdel Meguid, complaining about increased bombings
against his country and Turkey's role in the operations, asking the
Arab League to condemn the atrocities.
</P>
<P>
He stated that Iraq has been reserving its right to claim
compensations form Turkey, the United States and the united
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to Iraq's accusations over Turkey's involvement in the
latest bombings, Turkish diplomatic sources have contended that
Turkey played no role in the bombings, reported Turkish Daily News.
</P>
<P>
NATO member Turkey, which strongly supported U.S.-led forces
during the Gulf War to end Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, ironically
suffered an enormous loss of some 40 billion U.S. dollars in
potential revenues over the subsequent decade, as a result of the
U.S.-supported U.N. embargo on trade with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been known to stand for the sanctions lifted so that
lucrative trade with Iraq will be fully restored.
</P>
<P>
However, the strategic partnership forged between Ankara and
Washington has restricted Turkey's field of maneuverability because
of U.S. demand to punish President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the restrictions, Turkey believes, there is still
room to expand trade volumes between Turkey and Iraq under the U.N.
food for oil program which enables Iraq to import 5 billion dollars
worth of foodstuffs and drugs annually.

<HEADLINE> mee060402hke-- Security for Israeli PM Enhanced Following Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli General Security
Service or Shin Bet, has decided to tighten security around Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and government ministers amid recent reports
that extreme right-wing activists intend to harm Barak.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli daily Ha'aretz Sunday quoted sources as saying
that "among the extremist elements of the Judea and Samaria
settlers, there is once again talk of potential threat posed to
them because of the progress in talks with Palestinian (National)
Authority representatives."
</P>
<P>
They stressed, however, they have not received any concrete
information.
</P>
<P>
The extremists are also considering contacting rabbis who will
be willing to provide the settlements with a "spiritual umbrella"
backed up with rulings from Jewish religious law.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post, another Israeli daily, reported on Sunday
that there has been a sharp rise in recent weeks in the number of
threats against Barak by right-wing elements, reaching proportions
prior to the assassination of late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Former Shin Bet head Carmi Gillion called on authorities to
arrest all rabbis whose statements made in recent days can be
perceived as incitement.
</P>
<P>
The Shin Bet decided, following consultations with the police's
intelligence unit, to try and draft more agents among settlers, to
increase surveillance over extremist groups and to meet with rabbis
and settler leaders in an attempt to communicate the severity of
the situation.
</P>
<P>
Barak told the Labor Party's Central Committee on Friday that
Israel will keep 80 percent of settlers on the West Bank (or Judea
and Samaria as the Israelis term it) under Israeli sovereignty in a
possible upcoming agreement with the Palestinians. He said such an
agreement should be seen as a historic achievement.
</P>
<P>
The future of Israeli settlements is one of the tough issues to
be solved in the final status negotiations between Israelis and
Palestinians, who aim to clinch a permanent accord by September 13.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have reportedly reached
agreements after nine rounds of talks in Stockholm including the
fate of Jerusalem and the arrangements of refugees.
</P>
<P>
To help both sides bridge their remaining gaps, foreign
statesmen and diplomats will arrive in the region this week to
mediate the Israeli-Palestinian track of peace process.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson will arrive in Israel on
Sunday and meet Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross will land in Israel on Monday while
U.S. State of Secretary Madeleine Albright will arrive on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian President Meets with German Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
Sunday with German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Fischer were expected to discuss regional issues,
including the Middle East peace process and the Euro-Mediterranean
cooperation, and ways of promoting bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Fischer arrived in Cairo on Saturday for a two-day visit. He
held talks late Saturday with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa,
who told reporters after the meeting that they tackled the Mideast
peace process and issues in the Mediterranean region.
</P>
<P>
Fischer stressed at the press conference that realization of
peace in the Middle East is a prerequisite for stability in the
Mediterranean region. Germany has been stepping up efforts with its
partners to help push forward the Mideast peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed troop withdrawal from south Lebanon on May 24,
ending its 22-year occupation of a border strip in the region.
Syria and Israel have yet to resume talks on the return of the
Golan Heights that Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast
War. The Palestinians and Israel are negotiating for a final peace
accord, with little progress.
</P>
<P>
Germany, along with the European Union's other members and the
15-nation bloc itself, wants to play a major part in helping seek
peaceful settlement of the half-century Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said his talks with Fischer also took up the bilateral
ties, especially means of increasing German investments in Egypt
and ways to promote trade.
</P>
<P>
Germany is Egypt's largest trading partner among the EU members
and the second largest aid donor after the United States.

<HEADLINE> Presidents of Congo, Rwanda Agree to Restore Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda have agreed to resume
bilateral relations after secret talks in the Kenyan city of
Eldoret on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time of such talks since Rwanda sent troops
into DRC to back a rebellion there 22 months ago.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued after the meeting, Rwandan
President Paul Kagame and his counterpart Laurent Kabila also
resolved to work together to promote peace, security and
stability in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the meeting said this was the first step toward
efforts to restore relations between Rwanda and the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, which helped Kabila to oust Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997,
later fell out with the Congolese president.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, brokered by Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi, took
people by surprise as it had not been announced in advance.

<HEADLINE> Kenyans Urged to Conserve Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyans are urged to conserve
electricity by using alternative energy for cooking and water
heating, and to switch off all lights not in use.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Power and Lighting Company Saturday issued a
statement, appealing to all electricity consumers to use the
little available prudently for the water in the dams to last
through the dry period, the Sunday Nation newspapers reported.
</P>
<P>
The company asked customers in business zones to turn off neon
signs and decorative and exterior lights that do not serve any
security purpose.
</P>
<P>
Industrial customers are also requested to ensure their
equipment and machinery are switched off when not in use and that
they are maintained in good conditions to enhance efficiency in
electricity consumption.
</P>
<P>
Due to a two-year drought leading to the lowest water levels of
major energy reservoirs which have affected the power generation,
Kenya faces an electricity shortfall of between 154 and 360
megawatt in the off-peak and peak hours respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government a week ago introduced a 12-hour power
rationing schedule starting this week, with industrial and
commercial consumers having power between 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.
everyday except Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to power rationing, the government is also taking
other measures to solve the power shortage including the
importing of more electricity from Uganda and the recent signing
of two agreements to accelerate the delivery of two 55-megawatt
diesel generating plants.

<HEADLINE> Drug trafficking Increasing in East Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Wealthy foreign drug barons are
increasingly using Ugandans as couriers to smuggle narcotics and
other illicit drugs out of East Africa, the New Vision reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The drug lords, who operate an organized network, ferry the
drugs from Asian countries through East Africa to America and
Europe, said Erasmus Opio, acting director of the Crimes
Investigation Department.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of illicit dealing in drugs is rising in the region.
We are concerned that it is well organized and involves a number
of people, mainly foreign nationals," Opio was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Opio said East Africa is increasingly becoming a drug transit
hub. "Originally, we were only involved in the consumption. But as
time passed, we have noted that there are also production centers
of drugs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Drug crimes are a new phenomenon in the region, caused by
globalization and easy communication, said Opio, stressing that
the threat demands specialized personnel to handle it.
</P>
<P>
East African countries recently agreed to intensify operations
at their common borders to fight drug trafficking, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar to Increase Budget by 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar government is
expected to increase its budget by 20 percent in the next fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian official Sunday News quoted the Zanzibar Minister
for Finance Amina Salum Ali as saying during a pre-budget briefing
on Saturday that the government is about to spend 75.6 billion
Tanzanian shillings (about 94.5 million U.S. dollars) during the
2000/2001 fiscal year beginning on July 1, an increase of 12.9
billion (about 16.1 million U.S. dollars) compared with the
current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The minister said 53.6 billion shillings (about 67 million U.S.
dollars) out of the estimates will be for recurrent activities and
the balance will be allocated for development votes.
</P>
<P>
However, Amina explained, in the next development plan, the
government will implement a total of 33 projects down from 39
planned for the current financial year.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, under the new budget proposals, the
government will place emphasis on implementing self-help projects
and will continue to execute vigorous revenue collection drive to
enable them to meet their recurrent and development requirements.
</P>
<P>
The Isles budget session will open in Zanzibar next Thursday
when the Minister of State Ali Juma Shamuhuna will present the
annual development plan while Minister Amina will table the budget
proposals, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous state on the Indian Ocean with
its own government and parliament in the United Republic of
Tanzania which was formed in 1964.
</P>
<P>
The economy in Zanzibar is developing slowly in recent years,
partly because of the sanctions imposed by the 15 European Union
nations to withhold their aid to the Isles due to the political
situation surfaced shortly after the 1995 general elections.

<P>
MANILA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Authorities of the Ninoy Aquino
International Airport (NAIA) in Manila said Sunday that no one was
injured in a bomb blast at the airport earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Airport General Manager Antonio Gana said that the explosion
took place at the 10 meter-man-made embankment between the ramp
arrival curb site and the extension greeter's lounge.
</P>
<P>
"There was no security breach because this is a public place,"
Gana said.
</P>
<P>
A suspect for the bombing is a male between 24 and 29 years old
and the police has released a cartographic sketch of the suspect,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Gana said that two persons who were very close to the vicinity,
where the blast occurred are now being held for questioning by
airport authorities.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are still examining the explosive device used in
the blast, he said.
</P>
<P>
The manager said that immediately after the blast, a speeding
Ford Fiera was seen beating the red light between the Ninoy Aquino
Road and MIA road, nearing hitting a passenger bus.
</P>
<P>
Two passengers of the bus are now being questioned by airport
authorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gana said that the two passengers may be able to give a lead as
to the plate number of the speeding van.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the authorities arrested 26 suspects for a spate of
bombings in the Philippine capital. The government blamed Muslim
rebels for the bombing incidents.

India.

MANILA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Philippine newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Manila Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine armed forces is preparing for moves on Camp
Abubakar, the main headquarters of the separatist Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
Today:
</P>
<P>
-- The Abu Sayyaf holding eight remaining Filipino hostages in
Basilan is said to have entrusted its captives to the MILF. It
could bolster suspicions that the Abu Sayyaf and the MILF have a
de facto operation tie-up.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Tribune:
</P>
<P>
-- The Abu Sayyaf freed 10 German journalists late Friday after
they paid 25,000 U.S. dollars in ransom. They were held by the Abu
Sayyaf early in the day as they trailed a government medical
convoy to the hideout of the rebel group on the island of Jolo
where the 21 hostages it kidnapped from Malaysia in April are
being held.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Makes Significant Diplomatic Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has made
two significant diplomatic changes with effect from the middle of
this month, officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
They said Mangala Moonesinghe, the longest serving high
commissioner (ambassador) under the government of President
Chandrika Kumaratunga, moves to London from New Delhi while close
relative of the president Senaka Bandaranayake moves to New Delhi
from Paris.
</P>
<P>
Both Moonesinghe and Bandaranayake are considered as
confidantes of President Kumaratunga.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed much is expected from the two diplomats
in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Moonesinghe who commands respect from both the government and
the opposition circles has worked tirelessly to bring both India
and Sri Lanka closer in the recent times.
</P>
<P>
During his tenure, the Indo-Lanka relationship is at the
highest point and President Kumaratunga made two visits to India.
On a much publicized visit at the end of 1998, Sri Lanka signed a
bilateral free trade pact with India.
</P>
<P>
Moonesinghe is a devout Buddhist and a grandson of the late
Anagarika Dharmapala, a national hero and founder of India's
Mahabodi Society.
</P>
<P>
He takes over in London at a time when the Sri Lankan
government is seeking the support of the western nations including
Norway to play the role of peace brokers to help ending the 17-
year-old civil war with Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
Bandaranayake, an archeologist by profession, earlier this year
contested for the post of secretary general of the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government led a much unsuccessful campaign to
get him elected to the position. Only China and India voted in
his favor.

DHAKA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan dumped India out of the
seventh Asia Cup with a 44-run victory on Saturday to set up a
final clash against defending champions Sri Lanka on June 7, the
Independent newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Sri Lanka will meet Monday in the last league
match which only has academic interest after India bowed out of
the four-nation meet.
</P>
<P>
The defeat also dented India's remarkable record of reaching
all Asia Cup finals, except in 1986 when they did not take part in
the meet.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan batsman Yousuf Youhana, who reached the magical three-
fugure in the match, won the prize of man-of-the-match.

<HEADLINE> World Tourism Conference Postponed in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The paper quoted W.P.S.Jayawardena, Secretary of the Sri Lankan
Tourism Ministry, as saying that the World Tourism Organization (
WTO) executive committee meeting and the Business Council meeting
due to be held in Colombo on June 7 and 8 had been postponed by
the Sri Lankan government in consultation with the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Jayawardena told the paper that hundreds of delegates from more
than 35 countries were due to attend the conference which had been
billed as a platform for a major tourism promotion effort by the
country.
</P>
<P>
He added that since the country has been placed on a war
footing they cannot have any major functions at the WTO session
and therefore decided to postpone the event.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government declared on May 3 to mobilize the
entire country on a war footing to battle Tamil rebels who have
captured several key army camps and advanced to within 40
kilometers of the main northern town of Jaffna, their former
stronghold, which they lost to government troops in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Indian Inflation Dips to 6.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate dipped
marginally by 0.08 percentage points to 6.3 percent for the week
ended May 20, despite a small rise in overall wholesale price
index during the week, an official release said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation rate touched a 74-week high of 6.38
percent during the week ended May 13, mainly on account of a
sustained increase in the prices of items under Fuel, Power, Light
&AMP; Lubricants.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate for the week ended May 20 last year was
merely 3.33 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the week ended May 20, the wholesale price index for all
commodities increased by 0.1 percent to 151.9 as compared to 151.7
in the previous week, the official release said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Raises New Concept for Protecting Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) has cited a new concept of "multi-functionality of
agriculture" to reject integrating agriculture freely with free
trade, the Bangkok Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The concept, which is agreed at a recent ASEAN workshop meeting
here, is not only a tool for food security, but also would ease
environmental destruction resulting from overuse of chemicals, and
would help preserve local wisdom suitable for each community, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The concept will become a crucial factor in determining the
direction of ASEAN's policy on global trade, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"This concept is also going to be a very important issue in the
next World Trade Organization talks and other international forums
after having been ignored for years," an ASEAN official was quoted
as saying.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Makes Yet Another Controversial Remark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori
on Saturday made yet another controversial remark involving the
emperor, this time using the term "kokutai," which was used before
and during World War II to indicate Japan's national polity
centering on the emperor, media reports here said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) says it will not change its
principles. It does not recognize the imperial system," Mori said
at a lecture in Nara, ancient capital in southwestern Japan.
</P>
<P>
"The party calls for dissolving the Self-Defense Forces and
does not approve of the Japan-U.S. security arrangement," Mori
said.
</P>
<P>
"How could we possibly secure Japan's 'kokutai' (national
polity) and ensure public safety with such a party," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Kokutai" was commonly used to refer to what was seen as the
Japanese polity before and during World War II, and the most
important elements of the term were rule by an unbroken imperial
line and the concept of the state as a family, in which the
relationship between the emperor and his subjects was likened to
one between a father and his children.
</P>
<P>
But as a result of Japan's defeat in World War II and the
ensuring reforms under the occupation, the concept of "kokutai"
fell into disuse and has little meaning to most Japanese today.
</P>
<P>
Mori's comment follows his recent controversial remark that
Japan is a divine nation with the emperor at its center. The "
divine nation" remark drew wide criticism as it echoed the
ideology behind Japan's wartime militarism.
</P>
<P>
Yukio Hatoyama, leader of the main opposition Democratic Party
of Japan (DPJ), criticized Mori Saturday night over his "kokutai"
remark, saying it once again exposed Mori's firm conception for a
return to the prewar period.
</P>
<P>
The JCP, meanwhile, said it will take the "kokutai" remark to
question Mori's qualifications to be prime minister.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Society Determined to Promote NZ-China Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AUCKLAND (New Zealand), June 4 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand-
China Friendship Society (NZCFS) is determined to double its
effort to promote friendship and exchange between the peoples of
New Zealand and China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Society's annual conference, which was held on
Saturday and Sunday in Auckland, the biggest city of New Zealand,
National President Bill Willmott noted this is "a favorable time
for our Society, with growing interest in Chinese culture and
language in New Zealand and ever improving relations with China."
</P>
<P>
He urged branches of the Society to make realistic plans for
progress and advance on their efforts to bring New Zealand-China
ties closer.
</P>
<P>
Willmott said his Society still has a lot of things to do in
promoting educational and cultural exchange, tourism, and sister-
city ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Chen Yongchang of the Chinese People's
Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC), who
came here especially for the annual event, also addressed the
conference, praising the "friends in the NZCFS" for their hard
working for promoting mutual understanding and friendship between
the two peoples over the past few decades since the NZCFS was
established in 1952.
</P>
<P>
"The NZCFS is our counterpart in New Zealand for conducting
people-to-people exchanges. Close relations of cooperation and
friendly sentiments have been forged between our two organizations.
All of us in the CPAFFC cherish very much our relations and
friendship," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the past few decades, practical results have been achieved
in non-governmental diplomacy between China and New Zealand. These
achievements cannot be separated from the great support and
coordination given by the NZCFS," Chen stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Consul General in Auckland Zhao Xiangling said at the
conference that before the establishment of diplomatic relations
between the two countries, the NZCFS stood at the foremost
demanding the New Zealand Government to recognize people's China.
</P>
<P>
"You have all along played a championing role in promoting
people-to-people exchanges between the two countries since the
formal relations were forged in 1972," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao noted all the sympathy and support the NZCFS has given
China over the years are "deeply appreciated" by the Chinese
Government and people.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor of Auckland Bruce Hucker also attended the
conference. He said in his speech that the New Zealand Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and Trade has for a long time recognized the
positive role the NZCFS has played in deepening understanding and
friendship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He pledged his support to the NZCFS's future work.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference examined the Society's work in the past
year and made plans for the next year on the basis of suggestions
from the branches.
</P>
<P>
The conference also elected new National Committee of the
Society with Willmott remaining the national president.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Equip with Israeli Boats in Fighting Against Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka navy will soon be
quipped with the naval combat craft promised by Israel to crush
Sea Tigers, the naval unit of Tamil Tiger rebels, the official
Sunday Observer reported.
</P>
<P>
"Israel has agreed to supply Sri Lanka navy with these craft
which have the capacity to bombard shore targets from off-shore,"
said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
It said the combat craft can launch missiles from different
kinds of sea platforms with a maximum range of 36 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The strengthening of the navy's strike capability follows a
decision by military planners to neutralize the naval bases of
separatist rebels of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels, fighting for a separate state for minority
Tamils since 1983, have engaged in a ferocious assault in recent
weeks in a bid to retake their former stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE naval bases are also known to be the principal landing
points for much of the rebels' clandestine supply deliveries by
sea.
</P>
<P>
"The new strategy will be to squeeze the LTTE's vital ordnance
supply lines by striking at the Sea Tiger bases and clandestine
harbors," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It said military planners hope to neutralize the known Sea
Tiger strongpoints particularly along the eastern coastline from
Mullaitivu to Alampil and in the Challai sector.
</P>
<P>
Over the years Israel has supplied Sri Lanka navy with some
Dvora fast attack craft. The navy plans to provide computer guided
weapons systems for its whole fleet of Dvora craft.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Listed Dotcom Firms Post Better Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Both NASDAQ-listed Chinese dotcom
companies, the first Chinadotcom and then the Sina.com, reported
better than expected results in the first quarter despite concerns
about their profitability.
</P>
<P>
Chinadotcom Corporation reported total revenues of 20 million U.
S. dollars for the first quarter ending March 31 with a total loss
of 11 million U.S. dollars. The Sina.com reported 3.6 million U.S.
dollars in revenues with a total loss of 12.1 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although both companies are losing money from daily operations,
Chinadotcom reported a net profit of 109 million because of the
listing of Hongkong.com, a subsidiary of Chinadotcom.
</P>
<P>
Chinadotcom has four portals now in the Asia-Pacific region:
http://www.china.com, http://www.hongkong.com, http://www.taiwan.
com and http://www.cww.com.
</P>
<P>
As to the Sina.com, it would have reported a red-figure result
if without the help of a non-operating gain in the period. Wang
Zhidong, CEO of the Sina.com, said that they were excited about
the results as a public company.
</P>
<P>
Sina.com had 5 million registered users by the end of April and
reported 24 million daily surfers. Chinadotcom had attained 4.5
million registered users by the end of March with 16 million daily
surfers by April.
</P>
<P>
However, Peter Yip, CEO of Chinadotcom, said the number of
surfers was important, but it was unstable and changed every day,
their goal is " to improve the value to shareholders".
</P>
<P>
"We will turn to black next year," said Yip, " E-business
solutions and on-line advertising will be major revenue pools."
Revenues from the E-business accounted for 51 percent of
Chinadotcom's total income.
</P>
<P>
Sina is now dedicating resources to the development of Internet
software and WAP (wireless application protocol) techniques.
</P>
<P>
Sina.com launched its new Sina 2000 product recently and WAP
alliances with leading telecommunications vendors, such as
Ericsson, Motorola and Siemens to deliver content to wireless
devices.

<HEADLINE> Children's Day: Big Day for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Businesses that serve children's
interests were delighted to see their turnover rocket on the
International Children's Day.
</P>
<P>
Beijing department store staff said the sales volume of
children's items, including clothes, toys and food, increased by
200 percent last week compared to ordinary sales patterns.
</P>
<P>
Rough estimates indicate Chinese parents spent several billion
yuan on their children last week. And official statistics suggest
the one-fifth to one-third of an urban family's spending is for
children.
</P>
<P>
Hu Chao said," The market could be as large as several billion
U.S. dollars." Hu is manager of leyou.com, China's largest on-
line shop for children's things launched at the beginning of this
year.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 400 million people under 18 years old, 200
million under 14 and 20 million new-borns every year, China has a
huge market for children's items, she said.
</P>
<P>
Take children's clothes for example. An investigation by the
State Information Center on 37 Beijing-based department stores
show that total sales of children's clothes was 18.24 million yuan
( about 2.2 million U.S. dollars) last year, up 12.8 percent from
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of the family planning policy in China,
Chinese parents are more doting upon their only child in the
family. Also, children's products like baby body lotion and food
are also favored by adults.
</P>
<P>
All of these indicate a great potential of children's market in
China. But the quality of some children's food products has been
questioned. A survey by the Shanghai Bureau of Quality and
Technical Supervision indicates that 70 percent of the examined
babies' food in Shanghai is yet up to standard.

<HEADLINE> China Unicom Upgrades CDMA Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China Unicom, reaffirming the
proposed CDMA (code division multiple access) project, plans to
modify its already-designed construction proposal from a narrow-
band mobile system to a third generation CDMA 2000 system.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from China Unicom said, "The timing of
constructing a narrow-band CDMA system has become unfavorable, so
we plan to build a Wide-band CDMA 2000 network. " The company had
planned to provide CDMA services this summer. The nationwide
mobile network, with a designed capacity of 50 million lines, will
require more than 100 billion yuan ( about 12 billion U.S. dollars)
.
</P>
<P>
The US-favored CDMA system is the same as the European GSM (
global system of mobile communications), which is now widely used
in China. There are two main third-generation technological
standards, the CDMA-supported CDMA 2000 and the GSM-generated
WCDMA, which will ensure much faster wireless transfers than
current systems for things like video images and other multimedia.
</P>
<P>
Song Junde, professor from Beijing University of Posts and
Telecommunications, said, "China Unicom has gained an unparalleled
position in China's future mobile telecom market, no matter
whether with a narrow-band CDMA or a wide-band CDMA 2000 system."
</P>
<P>
The State Council last year authorized Unicom to solely
construct and operate a CDMA network in China. And a high-ranking
official from the Ministry of Information Industry (MII) said in
May that the government would continue to help the development of
China Unicom to become a formidable competitor in the telecom
market.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Chunjiang, MII vice-minister noted that the best way to
support China Unicom is to let it grow and run the Code Division
Multiple Address (CDMA) network.
</P>
<P>
China Unicom is now allowed to provide telecom services at a
price 10 to 20 percent lower than that of its major competitors,
China Telecom and China Mobile.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang, China's leading cotton
grower, has decided to expand this year's acreage of colored
cotton to 5,333 hectares and make Xinjiang the largest colored
cotton producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
The International Committee of Organic Agriculture predicts
that 30 percent of the cotton output around the globe will be
replaced by colored cotton in upcoming 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang experimented with growing colored cotton at Awat
County and the city of Shihezi in 1994. Colored cotton is
pollution-free, involving no bleaching and dying and sold two or
three times higher than the price of ordinary cotton. At present,
brown, green and light tan cottons are available on the local
market.
</P>
<P>
Tiancai Science and Technology Stock Company has developed a
long-fibre cotton ranging from 35 to 37 mm in length and new
cotton strains which resist cotton aphids and other diseases. The
company's output value of colored cotton surpassed 100 million
yuan last year.

optimistic and supportive of the policies of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) and the government, according to results of a
